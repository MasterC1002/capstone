Two weeks ago I dreamt I killed myself. A lot of stuff happened but it was pretty much about a zombie attack in a neighbourhood I used to play in when I was a kid. Near the end of my dream I got bitten by a stray zombie head that was rolling around on the ground, it was so WARM too! I've never realized before that blood would be warm, kinda crazy that my subconscious mind would think that detail up. 

Anyway the second cut I charged more power with my arms in some odd way and cut half my head off, kept going up towards the sky until it got too cold and hard to breathe (space?) and the dream ends. Had another dream after that but I'll stop here.

 that's pretty much a feature length with an awesome story about love and sacrifice. Also it gets a little weird but its a dream so get over it.

 It starts out in the rain forest outside this broken arena. The arena looks like it has been in disrepair for awhile and it has a really Aztec look to it. I am a teddy bear

At this point my point of view changes to the young warrior. I wake up on a stone slab with the woman and teddy bear over me. Next to them is a gruff old man. I awake and tell them my story. I was fighting a tyrannical ruler of an ancient kingdom in the arena. I was defeated by him because he can harness the power of the ""shock wave"" to batter his opponents (kinda like fus roh dah) This king has been known to take beautiful women to a cave beneath a water fall where he sacrifices them to keep his people obedient. 

The old man begins to teach me how to fight and harness the power of the shock wave. He tells me he taught the king the shockwave to defeat ""Stone giants"" and become king. He feels guilt for the tyrant the ruler has become

So later after I have become  skilled in the art. Me and the woman are walking through the forest together. I feel love towards her and I am constantly admiring her beauty. Suddenly the king shows up. He uses shock wave to knock me into the canopy where I am bound by vines. The woman and the king fight for a time

When I finally free myself I feel a lot of grief. I know where he has taken her

When I enter I see the girl tied to the far wall

The interesting part is I knew what would happen if I made this choice. But I decide not to finish him and save the girl. I pull air from the vase using my mouth and breathe it into her. I can see her coming back to life so I cut her bonds. We make eye contact

I wake up on the stone slab and the girl is naked and crying. She lays her head on my chest and it fades out

Then it gets crazy

1358508520.0,16t8l8,I Dreamed about Salvation in Hell,darklogic420,31,4,12,"I had a dream last night.

It was a dream about Hell.

It wasn't fire and brimstone and demons with pitchforks Hell.
It was much worse.

It was a flat plain

There was no light in the sky.  There was no reliable way to tell time. Only fire provided light, nothing we rely on as a modern fuel source.  The few fires I saw were people burning their own refuse.  How they started those fires with only bones and refuse was a mystery to me.

There was no water and no food.  Everyone was hungry

At the bottom of the cliffs nothing could be seen

I was relieved to see that there were no children, and everyone’s skin was pale along with their eyes.  No one had any hair.  Everyone was naked, but disfigured to the point that other people could be desired only for food.  Lust was forgotten.  Pride was forgotten.  

One man caught my eye.  He worked hard carving bowls out of stone, they were so overcome by his generosity that they sat next to him appearing almost numb.

He would spend a long time with anyone who spoke to him, and reminded them of the simple joy of being with another person and treating each other as human beings.  In time, he taught people how to remember parts of their former lives, and how to draw strength from those memories.  He was simply known as the Teacher.

This went on for a long time.  This place was horrible and oppressive, and defended each other and strangers from being prey.  A semblance of a society began to form in a remote corner of this world, with the Teacher and his word forming the basis of a new code of ethics.  The most basic precepts of his teachings were carved in stone and pilgrims carried his words to the farthest corners of the abyss.

I was most surprised though

Flanked by angels, “Take my Hand, and let me take you to Paradise.”
The Teacher smiled genuinely, great King, to join me here and help me restore these people to themselves.”

And Jesus was sad.  For several more days he approached people, leaving it forever.  Almost all of the Teacher’s followers went with Jesus to Paradise.

The Lord returned to the Teacher and said to him

Once again, for your mercy on these wretched souls of ours.  I fear though that you have made the need for me even greater where I am.  Please, take with you the last of my people, and let me remain here to minister to the lost. There are many who have not yet learned the Way, and many more yet to descend into this darkness.  It is better to attend to the lost than to rest in luxury. ”

And Jesus was sad

Dreams are a representation of our subconscious

Interpreting dreams is to try to give the right meaning to the different symbols in our dreams (like the persons, etc); which means not only to try to understand the dream itself, but also to make the already mentioned relation with our lives.

For the more skeptical, there are a lot of interpretations to similar dreams/symbols; but since some dreams like ""my teeth are falling"" are common, a general meaning is given in order to get closer to understanding them.

I've found this ""dream interpretation experience"" quite impressive

I was on a conveyer belt with a lot of other ears of corn going to be sliced up and cut into pieces. This was inside a HUGE factory

The guy operating the conveyer belt was mad at me, as an ear of corn I should only be worth 30 cents or so. He said alright, and for a few minutes I scrounged around and found 30 cents on the factory floor. Unfortunately, the operator double crossed me and didn't accept the deal after I gave him 30 cents. It occured to me that he probably just wanted to buy a soda, which then made me realize that I was set to probably sweeten sodas just like that one. 

Terrified of being turned into sugar, being a ear of corn and everything. I got outside the factory, and noticed how BIG it really is. 

This factory is about 50 levels high. But it could also have just looked huge because I was corn. Anyways, he held a glass with some kind of knock-out poison in it. 

I felt my consciousness fleeting and tried to get away from this guy, but the others were too deep for me to see what was in them.

I jumped into this holding cell, and all very relatable to me even though I was corn and they were sheep.

At this point the manager of the entire factory comes into this room and says that he is mad at all the live stock and produce

He grabs a pretty girl sheep and tries to pull her into another room. I then stand up and say ""YOU CAN SAY NO!"" and look around, mind you, and I don't sound like corn. We all sound like people. ""YOU CAN SAY NO, YOU CAN SAY NO, YOU CAN SAY NO."" 

At this point the manager drops the pretty girl sheep with a look of terror in his eyes

As a huge mass we move toward an open door on the other side of the door the manger was going to use. We surge in

This is no ordinary maze. It has spikes shooting into the walk way

After about three obstacles the pressure gets to me

TL;DR: I was an ear of corn in a factory. Got out

The first

The second, looked like we were in London somewhere.

So on and so forth

Until last night.



My dreams are extremely vivid. I don't know where I was

I remember..not really knowing this was a dream..but somehow I knew that where I was

I subconsciously knew that

I decided to walk.

Best decision of my life.


Down the sidewalk a little.. I see Ryan. He's walking towards me. I notice it's him. I'm pretty sure I'm dreaming..

And I'm so happy that my brain has remembered what his face looks like.

I miss that face.

But he smiles like a stranger just being nice. I think

I can't take it.
I'm only 5 feet away

Of course

We go for a walk. He's laughing at me and my crying. I'm laughing and telling him how I can't really help it. It's going to happen every time I see him out of pure happiness. The last dream I saw him in

We end up walking to what seems to be his car and start driving.

Me

I am where he's ended up.

I ask about God.

He says he hasn't met him.

""So, or what you can do?""

""Yeah.""

""So you've been here all this time..which is why you haven't visited me in my dreams lately? Can you hear me ask for you at night?""

He can't hear me when he's in this place and didn't know I needed him.

I remember hugging him and telling him how much I've missed him.

""I have to hug you now..because I didn't get to hug you while you were alive.""

I've felt so shitty since the day I realized that I've never even hugged him. This hug now would be the third.

All three were only in my dreams.

We sit there in his car watching people. I can't really describe the scene well enough.. but it's like they were all coming out of a ball. Casual dress though. It just seemed like a big important thing for all of them to be at.

I then realize how long I've been with him and ask

I don't feel scared. In my dreams where I die

The only thought that passes my mind is how I'll miss everyone as he says

I remember hugging him again. Soaking in his arms and missing him even though he's there.. and I wake up.

my nightmare started out relatively normally...i was being held hostage by terrorists (not the religious extremist kind, but they threw a grenade at us. one of the girls said not to worry, the grenade was probably just a smoke bomb. she was wrong, it blew up into epic proportions. flames engulfed everything. i tried running to the nearest building but the door was locked, and a severed head flew through the door...i tried to open it from the broken window from the severed head but...the flames got to me. I was absolutely dead. 

Instead of waking up, horrified, and runs away. 

then i see this really great forest with some sweet bike paths on which i can take my mountain bike. i start riding through this nice forest, and why i got a strange look from the guy (probably because he just saw the gas pump being put back on its own). 

i walk to the top of the hill, existing side by side. soon i see some people running towards me. it's my grandparents, who had died several years ago. they were so happy and welcoming and were glad i could join them. i said that's all well and good, but i want to see my parents. my grandmother said ""ah"", in a sad disappointed way. 

suddenly, to tell them that i had died but it was okay and i was in the room with them...but they couldn't see or hear me. i go up to my dad and try and get his attention while he's pacing. eventually i scream ""DAD!!!!!"" in his face. he stops and squints at me. he holds out the palm of his hand, looking very stern. i know immediately what to do. i trace a ""D"" in his palm. He nods, still looking stern. I trace a ""E"". He nods. I trace an ""A"". He turns his palm into a fist and starts screaming ""NO! NO! THIS IS IMPOSSI-""

...and then I woke up. It was horrific waking up from that. Everything was frightening and I had the sinking feeling that something horrible was going to happen. I then had a panic attack (I have anxiety issues so this happens every so often) and kept repeating ""I was supposed to wake up after I died...why didn't I wake up...I wasn't supposed to see that..."" It was all very creepy.

It's a loaded question. If you say “no” you ignore the many dreams that appear to accurately predict the future. If you say “yes

We love tough questions here at /r/dreams and invite the community to weigh in with their experiences and opinions in the comments.

To kick off the discussion

____

From [Archer](/u/archersadvice):

Do dreams predict the future? Yes, your religious scriptures will tell you this. (If you are atheist, “No”, I cannot prove it to you.) Every dream that is interpreted in the Christian Bible is interpreted by a devoutly religious person. The dreams are ALWAYS messages from God. Some of the messages are prophetic, most notably, Joseph’s interpretation of the dream of Pharoh (7 years of wealth followed by 7 years of famine). So if you are a person of faith, you can definitely have faith in prophetic dreams.

How about now, not commonly. Not often. And, seldom privately. The purpose of the prophecy is to communicate an important message from God. So the prophetic message is probably NOT going to be “your car will not start tomorrow”.

Many ambitious goals begin with a real dream. We even use the word dream to mean goal
Prathia Hall had a real dream about rebuilding her church that had recently been burned down. Martin Luther King Jr. heard her talk about it and built her “I have a dream!” speech into the defining moment of the civil rights movement. He gave his famous speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, she said loudly said to him “Tell them about the dream, Martin!” Watch the film footage and you’ll see Dr. King’s speech come alive at the exact moment that he leaves his scripted notes and begins to talk about his dream and says “I have dream!”.

So yes, a collection of random thoughts and exciting television moments crammed together into a meaningless series of images (watch TV for a few moments, then think about your thoughts while watching … mostly meaningless entertainment).

So how do you know if your dream is prophetic? That’s what dream interpreters are for! We can interpret your dream from God language to people language. When interpreted correctly, but you WILL know that it is an important dream.
What about people who say, nor are they particularly messages from God. I cannot really explain them in any modern scientific way, and I have been given no special knowledge about these dreams. But my speculation is that these are occasionally real and result from some sort of psychic energy or thought transference that I do not know about.

BUT, but not very often. (I believe that there is life in the universe besides on earth, but I also believe that 99+% of UFO reports are “not real”.) I have never known a dream interpreter who can find any meaning or value in this type of sensationalized precognitive dream.

Starts out in a friends Parents House- We are all eating, but in the meantime my friends from montreal are eating all the food. So- I try and ask for scraps but nay- they ignore me... 

Suddenly we hear the call- We all have to leave because someone they know just died. So we all start leaving the house

 I exit the house, and then I realize that I must enter MY key to the left side and everyone is waiting! I return to the inside of the house and discover that my brother has forgotten his jacket. I grab it and my key simultaneously  somehow but it seems as though Ive become extremely drunk upon trying to find my way out. At some point I fall and hurt either my leg and/or my hip. Once outside again, I place the jacket in the middle of the driveway to the house, which is hard for him to see because now its dark blue outside and its raining hard core- I return to left side where my brother taunts me as I try and find the lock and turn the key. I manage to! I manage to get to my car that is waiting for me, inside are my mom and dad. 

But wait!

 Just maybe five feet away from the back right door of the car are my dad's shoes laying on the lawn- My dad mentions ""Oh I've forgotten my shoes, but I protest, still reaching for them to say ""Its okay I got em-"" She ignores me, ""Its okay I'll get them!"" I protest! My dad protests too. Suddenly she starts to drive over them, and I retract back inside the car and close the door to avoid breaking it, and I look at my mom and think- 'What is she doing?' I notice that now we are in a graveyard- (I suppose it had been a graveyard the whole time but it just got bright enough to notice!) I look back at my Mom and realize there's something very wrong with her driving. Suddenly we swerve to the left and begin our downward descent into some GIANT PIT- of course we had gained some momentum forward from the car so our motion is somewhat of a whirlpool- the first time we hit- SMASH I hit my head hard! From this point on in the dream my head is in the worst pain I have ever felt. 

We seem to stop so I'm relieved and we all sort of chuckle, one thing is for sure: I cant really sense anything except the memory of my self.

I seem to wake up and again me and my mother and father are travelling in this shiny black vehicle with beige interior. I realize, for some reason the Police answers with this long ridiculous informative update about updates to their system and to please be patient with the new bullshit and I scream at him to SHut the FUCK UP and Listen! ""We are at the cemetary, we have just fallen into a pit- we need help right away because we are all badly injured-"" Suddenly, my mom swerves again and this time we sorta just bounce into a ditch but I see her go flying out the window of her door over to near a pond- the car flips a bit, but as soon as it's still I run to the side of the pond where I see her slipping through the mud into the pond- I look back quickly where my dad is sitting on the side completely dazed and just out of this word- he mutters something inaudible.

I run over to my mom where i see here slip into the darkness of the water- FUCK! I try and see where exactly i should dive to get her but its impossible to see so I just jump in... I manage to grab her legs and I slowly pull the rest of her body toward me- to my relief shes still holding her breath or something and when I lift her head out of the water but she's too heavy and just gargles water. I have soo much goddamn trouble and my head feels like its been broken that I just keep struggling on but I think to myself ""My mom just had a Stroke!... 


Suddenly I wake up again, my head is bleeding everywhere and I can't move the right side of my hip/leg mostly. I think; Oh this stupid hip- its been bothering me for a while and now its really fucked up Ill have to get a new one and I'll be doomed to bad hips the rest of life till Im an old geezer in an old age home. I manage to get up and hobble my way to the entrance of my luxurious room all the while screaming: Help- HELP HELP HELP- (This reminds me of all the times that we crashed our car- I screamed a blood curdling scream of doom)

 As I make it to the entrance of the room, I just tell him: My head is badly hurt- I need to go to the Hospital: he sorta hops over to the top of my bed and I sit down on the end of it- holding my skull. He says: No it's just the hangover from last night dont worry about it. I frown, stick my fingers into my hair, feel the blood- look at my fingers: see the blood. ""Dude I have to go to the Hospital!"" At this point shit kinda gets weird when Dakota Fanning as a child comes into the room and sits between me and Bill Murray... again I say ""I have to go to the Hospital my head is bleeding!!"" Bill says something dismissive again and then I see Dakota bury her face into her hands. she starts to cry. This is the first time I laugh: ""Oh don't cry- its okay, Im not gonna die!"" 

I get up again and Bill is eating some delicious pastries like donuts/timbits/other things from a silver platter on a roomservice table next to the bed. At this point I look outside and I see the two Trade Center towers and the view in between them is of a glowing sky (sunrise) and hazy Montreal below. I turn to Bill and I pick up some pastries, I think : ""I dont want to Die!"" (I begin to believe that I'm losing blood from my brain extremely fast, since everything is so fucked up and my mobility is wack- and I have a blood clot in the brain.) 

Like Dakota Fanning previously I begin to cry. At this point he really laughs at me and says"" your Freaking out man just take it easy""- (I've never seen such a Disheveled looking Bill Murray laugh like that before...) Suddenly the worst ringing begins- like the one on 2001 a Space Odyssey, but my head too! (Definite sign of stroke right?) I tell Bill Murray and he laughs again and continues to eat his sweets and now even Dakota Fannind doesn't believe me. FUCKERS!! So much Rage towards these incompetent assholes.

 I decide to take action and I pick up a phone to call 911 again. This time though, and he has just used another phone to hang up/disconnect the line. I realize then that he would like to see me die, and I just freak the shit out of my soul and sort of try again on the phone half heartedly. His serious smirk gets even more grim.

FINALLY

Tl:Dr Experienced shitloads of physical pain while watching my parents about to die twice- then woke up (in another dream) to the experience of having a stroke- tried to get Bill fucking Murray to help me but he just laughed and when I tried to call the cops he kept disconnecting the line like the disheveled Bastard that he is (was).",,t5_2qmbx,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/ixu1l/horrific_beyond_comprehension_starring_bill/

So we get out of the car and go into the theater. The exterior was completely normal like any strip mall movie theater in America, but much darker with only original furniture etc)

We go up to the front counter behind which was a woman from whom we bought our tickets. She was quite old and worn down looking

After purchasing our tickets we went into the theater it's self. I don't recall what the movie was at all

Here's where it starts to get interesting.

My friend and I decide we'd rather watch the movie from the balcony, turn a corner, and find another staircase going straight back downstairs with nothing on the landing up top. We would find a hallway, but it would contain absolutely nothing. We'd find doors, but they either wouldn't open or simply didn't lead anywhere.

Eventually we walked up a flight of stairs, was a stretcher. As we approached it we realized it was a old man (a corpse) covered in a sheet with it's head exposed.

Suddenly we see the old woman coming down the lower hallway. When she got to us we asked her how to get to the balcony. I don't remember the conversation exactly, out of sight down the hallway.

So now my friend and I decided that this place was creepy as hell and we didn't really want to be here anymore; we decided to leave. We walked back downstairs and were able to find the exit fairly easily. The exit of the building was modern - a set of double glass doors with a small entry/exit room followed by another set of glass doors like you'd find on most retail/restaraunts these days. I could see the parking lot through the doors.

We exited the first set of doors into the entry/exit room

We turned around. There, just staring at us.

Outside perspective always appreciated. Apologies for the wall of text. Occasionally I'm able to remember a lot about my dreams... This one is one of those.

A young man around my own age, we suspect that the old man suffers from dementia or the like. We ask if he has somewhere to go, or is there someone we can call...

That is when he realizes that we suspect he is homeless. His dirty, and he is touched by our concern. He says that young people don't pay much attention to him anymore and asks if we will follow him home; he wants to cook us dinner.

I am pretty sure this is a really bad idea. My friend, my friend tries to sooth my nerves by telling me that the old man probably lives in a cardboard box under a bridge and the sooner we find out, the sooner we can get him somewhere safe and be on our way.

The old man's house is a rundown

Looking through the door... All I can see is darkness. Pitch black. My friend goes inside and I follow him. Once we enter

The hallway is a single, all closed. The old man is nowhere to be seen. Both my friend and I panic, turn to the door we came through, and jiggle the knob. It's locked from the outside.

And so we randomly start opening doors, and a myriad of parallel dimensions all at the same time. A room where everything is upside down. A room that is another corridor, only the passageways lead to places they shouldn't... Namely, a staircase that stretches upward from the ceiling. 

We stumble upon a room that looks a bit more normal than the rest. There is a simple bed with dirty sheets, and something _stinks._ Is this the old man's bedroom? What is that smell?

And so my friend and I start poking around the room. I discover a dismembered prostitute under the bed

Footsteps. Oh shit... The old man is coming... Hide. My friend pulls me into a dark closet and we listen, pauses, then leaves. Once the sound of footsteps has faded into the distance, my friend flips on the closet light.

The closet is a warehouse, cardboard boxes. My friend starts to pull boxes off the shelf and open them; I do the same.

The boxes appear empty... But they aren't. Each box contains a thousand memories. Memories of the creation of the universe... Memories of watching every child ever born breathe it's first breath... Memories of murder. Memories of every beautiful and ugly moment that has ever unfolded on this planet.

And that's when I realize that the old man is God... That he observed humanity until our cruelty drove mad. So he packed all his memories away in boxes and filed them away in the most unsuspecting of places.

The most bizarre of these dreams are the most recent, but then the rest of the conversation is a blank.  One night, I dreamed that I was alone in a room with someone.  At the time, I knew who this person was, and I was saying some pretty strange things to them.  I don't remember all of it, but I remember saying, ""People can communicate in dreams.

While I have difficulty remembering dialog, like I know the information is there...I just can't retrieve it.
After I got back in touch with my friend, he's been intruding upon all of my dreams like before, only now when I see him, I become aware of the fact that I'm probably dreaming (I usually am unaware), and this realization causes me to wake up.  For example, I was dreaming that my roommate and I were throwing a house party, and I went to downstairs.  I saw him there, thinking, saying he could anchor me there if I held on.  I freaked out and ended up disappearing and reappearing in a new place
The very last one I had was about three nights ago.  I often dream about this isolated beach where I go to be alone.  I don't know how to describe it other than: I become a part of the ocean and ride the waves, and I'm always alone there.  This time, I was startled to find that my friend was standing on the shore, watching me.  I was upset to see him, because this place felt personal to me.  I asked, ""How do you keep finding me?""

It started when my dad lost his job, and things nearby often got bombed because it was in such a horrible area. One day, someone set the house on fire. I was screaming when my room set on fire and my window crashed, and my family was in a panic. My dad kept screaming “no air, no air, get air!” and I was freaking out and all the sudden everything went black.


I realized that what I had was a dream and I thought this was my body waking me up, I saw myself face to face with not a man, but multiple spirits. I was sitting on the clouds, and the stars and the moon were talking to me. The cloud moved over to the crescent-shaped moon and had me sit on his “lap” so it was a comfortable seat while they explained to me what was happening. I was crying, and nervous, when all the sudden I heard a dark voice telling me I was no longer a human. He explained to me that everyone was set out to have a plan in life, and my plan was to die that night. It didn’t make sense at first, they make decisions for their own and that leads them onto a path of good or bad. He also explained to me how I could’ve changed what happened


My wish, where people were having the same conversations as my friends and I did, except they were 24 hours ahead. I saw my friends and family crying over my death, when my brother and father made it out safe. I realized that humans and animals definitely weren’t the only life in the universe, that’s just what seems normal to us. I saw faces of what were called creatures that I’d never be able to process on my own, which was what scared me. They just weren’t something you’d be able to imagine. It’s hard to explain but they weren’t something would think of naturally.


After a long day of searching the universe, I could breathe normally but I couldn’t hear my own breathing. I could near other voices but not my own, which didn’t make sense to me of couse cause it was a dream. I asked, frightened, “Hello? Anybody, where am I?” A voice replied to me, sounding like it was casting from above, and a sigh, now or ever. Millions have been here
All of the sudden, in a complex situation. I was reincarnated into an eight year old girl from France going through a brain surgery, and I needed to take over her soul. Everything from my mind was supposed to vanish but whoever did the “procedure” did it wrong because in the back of my mind I remembered my past life perfectly. It turns out my soul wasn’t needed and I turned into a spirit up in heaven.


From that, I saw the boy I love flirting with another girl. I was screaming “no, please stop.” but he couldn’t here me. I watched him do what he did, and I was happy for him but I cried like crazy knowing I wasn’t there for him. I also saw my family at my funeral, and I cried over that too. I think my brain was sub cautiously trying to tell me that I don’t feel like I’m heard enough and that people pay attention to me but not enough. Maybe I’m just lonesome, I’m not sure.
The dream ended in me sitting in a rocking chair, hence why my dad was screaming “no air, no air, get air!”

What has been your most horrible nightmare?  Perhaps not on a scary level


**Story time:**

I had a nightmare about 4 years ago that to this day gives me chills when I think about it.  I was at my school, and I saw the health inspectors' van back at school.  One of them saw me and brought me into the nurses office to tell me that his partner had unknowingly transfered the virus to my school, and that the kids he had tested needed to be retested.  I came up positive for the disease, but not contagious.

This was where the dream turned into a nightmare.  I was told I had 3 days left to live, but I started really focusing on life, and living.  And then, on the morning of my last day alive, I woke up.  For real.  And I was convinced that I was going to die that day for about 15-20 minutes as I sat there in bed.  It was absolutely terrifying, but once I actually realized it was a dream I think I valued life a heck of a lot more.",,,,

Those of us who survived were allowed to live on a lush and fertile planet, flora and even buildings. My family and I touched down on a spacecraft, and I took the first step out to behold a vast open field of green, and I knew this was indeed to be our new home.

I beheld no less than 3000 fellow humans alongside us. We truly were the last remnants of our race.

My family and I hurdled close together. We traveled in a file with the other humans

The answer lied before us. To our convenience a flight of stairs had already been established, and people were already going in.

Holding my mother's hand, a school. It was my school, and yet it also wasn't my school. I had no idea why I felt so, but I just knew it to be true and false at once.

Without any warning, easily the size of a T. rex! ""Just a little more!"" he said in a surprisingly gentle voice. We knew not who he was, nor what he wanted, but we continued to climb the stairs.

At last we left the confines of the metal caged stairs

There I learnt plenty. I learnt that there were 3 races here on this planet. We humans

I knew I spent a great deal of time in the school and there was much more I learnt...But that knowledge is lost to me now. All I remember is that the friendly giant aliens were called B1000. It was an apt name

I closed my eyes briefly

The giant human I saw earlier? He was, he was balanced on two enormous dinosaur-like legs with immense muscles, he stretched his wings and I saw the incredible form and flesh that spoke of his ability to fly, and his head which was as big as a car, held two hungry malevolent eyes along with an enormous beak that could surely swallow me in a gulp. He was terrifying, a mix of a terror bird, the size and ferocity of a T. rex and the wings of the biggest bird-of-prey that had ever existed.

And that bastard was hungry.

I saw nothing but chaos as he charged into a crowd of frightened people and lowered his enormous head. When he raised his head again, and we helpless humans were on the menu.

We fled before his onslaught like sheep fleeing a voracious wolf. Somehow I was in a city, or at least none he could not breach. Again and again he fed and ripped and gnawed, leaving a trail of blood and bones. This was impossible! Granted he was an enormous dinosaur-sized predator, but even he had limits to his stomach capacity! That was like what? His 100th human?

The screams of fear and frightened yelling was deafening

I heard a roar of defiance and a B1000 alien slammed into him. Yes! Help had arrived!

A group of B1000s stood on standby as the lone hero grappled with the giant bird-dino thing. He held a spear

Again and again the titans tussled for control and we weak humans simply stood nearby to watch the awesome battle unfold.

The bird monster flapped his wings and took into the air. Before the heroic B1000 could react

I glared at the group of B1000s watching nearby. What were they doing?! They were many

His flailing and moans weakened

Goddammit! Goddammit! He was just one! JUST ONE! Why couldn't anyone or the B1000 stop him?! But at least he was satisfied now. He swept his gaze across all of us and licked his beaks

And I knew this was only the first night. Every night this scene would unfold once more

The next day did not come....because for a strange reason, but lines of spirals hundreds of meters long were cut into the ground and even cliffs. Somehow we human beings had descended back to the level of tribal village people, and now there were hundreds of tents strewn all across this strange landscape.

In the center of the spiral which was hundred of meters away from me there was a commotion. Perhaps the village elder speaking? It mattered not. I cared little and hurdled in my tent with my family.

""Humph!"" The giant human appeared again and sat beside us. We gaped at him in fright and shock

He didn't wear his monster bird form either

My family ended up in........a bread shop? I had no idea why or how, I was aware that back at the camp, a man stood before the giant. He was a stranger to me, but he looked arrogant and unpleasant. I knew not what he said to the giant, only that by the end of the exchange, the giant was practically leering at him.

""You best be running little man

I do not know what happened to the man

I went back to my tent and peered inside to look for supplies. When I looked out again the giant stood before me

Grabbing a bench that was near my tent, I am sure of it.

He lowered his enormous face to the entrance of the tent

""We both know how this ends.""
""Yes I can wake up.""

A little back story first:

A couple years back a friend was backing out of a driveway when something in the rear view mirror caught his eye. He stopped to see what it was. It was a turtle in the gutter that was trying to get out of the way of the truck. It was an aquatic turtle (western painted, i was just going to find someone on craigslist to take it since i wasn't really prepared to take on a pet that required large aquariums and such. In the meantime, i bought some turtle food and filled up a large tupperware bin to keep him alive for a couple days. After the first day i got attached to the little guy and decided to keep him. I named him Zeus. I really bonded with this turtle. He was way more interactive and responsive than i ever imagined a turtle would be. When i would get home from work he would splash around to get my attention. I would take him out of the tank and he would hang out with me. He loved to be held and would just chill on my lap. He loved attention. He was seriously like a dog in a turtle body.  Once people found out i had a turtle, people started giving me turtles that were rescued or in situations where people couldn't take care of them properly anymore. I ended up getting multiple tanks to keep them all. While i loved all my turtles, none of them interacted with me the way Zeus did. Most didn't want to be held. They interacted with me when they wanted food, but that was about it. Zeus was different than the others. 

And now to the dream:

Nearly a year had passed since i first got Zeus. I had a dream that i was floating in a pond with my best friend i'd known since high school. We'll call her Cindy. The pond was beautiful. It was surrounded by lush vegetation. There were a few small streams that flowed in and out of the pond. We were floating in the pond on those cheap inflatable pool rafts. We were just floating there soaking up the sun. I felt totally at peace. All of a sudden, Zeus swam down stream again and said ""See, i told you i would be back. I will always come back."" This happened a few more times. While the times he was away in the dream seemed to be only minutes, in my dream i knew somehow it represented a longer time. Like months or years passed. It's hard to explain exactly. It was such a happy dream too. I just felt complete joy and peace like i've never felt before in a dream. 

I woke up and just felt amazing. It was the most beautiful dream I'd ever experienced. It was more than just the events

But here is where it gets weird. 

A couple weeks later i was feeding the turtles in the morning. I noticed Zeus wasn't swimming up to get the food like he usually did. He was just kind of hanging out at the bottom and wasn't moving much. I just knew something was wrong. I felt sick to my stomach. Just the day before he was fine. I took him straight to the vet. He didn't make it that far. He died on the way on my lap. This was exactly a year to the day that i got him. (I remember this because it was my roommates birthday.)

I was absolutely devastated. I mourned for this turtle the way i would have a dog. (It's years later and i'm still getting teary eyed just typing this.) The next day i was still a mess over it. Cindy called and invited me to go on a weekend trip with her and some friends. I declined saying i wouldn't be good company since i was still so upset. She convinced me that i needed something to take my mind off it. I reluctantly agreed. We arrived at the hotel. The boys all headed off to the casino to gamble. Cindy and i decided to head to the pool. We went to walmart first to buy some floaty pool toys. We were looking for those cheap inflatable rafts

So there we were floating in the pool on our blow up turtles when it hits me. OH MY GOD. It's my dream. I'm floating in a pond (pool) with Cindy and Zeus. Maybe it was just a coincidence

It's been a couple of years now and i still miss that little guy. I currently have 9 turtles. I love them all

I have my own theories of what that dream means

TL;DR: Got a pet turtle. Had a dream that turtle told me he had to go away but he'd always be back. He died a couple weeks later out of the blue. Experienced part of the dream in real life.

We were taking some stuff from the store because it was destroyed anyway, then it ate their skin away, but she's not anywhere to be seen.

The dream started with me and a group of people outside a tall building. The past memories of this building and what it represented were already well established. This was the central building for an oppressive government that ruled over the area that we all lived in. Like a Feudal Lord of our city. We were prisoners, working around the base of this building and living in these shacks. Like a shanty town. One day seemingly out of no where, I hatched a plan to capture one of the guards as he drove by in his car and we'd take his gun and we'd use it to break out of this place. The oringal group of people in this plan consided of 9 people. We had someone lay down in the street and when the car came and stopped we all jumped out and rushed the guard and took the gun. Then from there we moved forward to capturing more guards and more guards until our forces were well poorly armed. By then we managed to cause a bit of a rucus and everything was pretty hetic. A few days had past and we were held up in this building quarters and sort of in martial law because of the uprising. More government people and guards had been called in and we were planning our next move. I had a meeting with all of the prisoners/slaves. They all wanted to come and swear their allegence to me and decided that they would follow me to overthrow the Feudal Lord I took the original 9 people aside and I told them to get name tags because they were the ones I trusted the most and they would become my personal guards and right hand. There was this one girl an asian girl she was about 5'2, thin very agile and atheletic studied martial arts and I started to like her after fighting with her for a while and she was also apart of my guard. There was this big black guy I called him Tank but he wanted to be known as Nato, and I always put him as my look out, and then there was this other guy name Charlie who I had follow me around all the time cause he was really strong. I can't remember the others names but they kept their original green shirts so I'd know who they were. 

We ended up leading the charge against this building and it was a crazy ass gun fight. We charged inside of the ground floor me and all of the slaves/prisoners and we ended up taking one of the higher ups captive and killing them and freeing the other slaves under his control and adding them to our army

2 years past, or something with an M. Her brother was Lee I had sent him away for 2 years to train in martial arts because I would want him to be my splinter cell incharge of personally overseasing the saftey of my family in the event of an emergency. He was like this super bad ass killing machine. One night we were having a meeting and interrogating a spy we captured. When they attacked us, I immediately sent him to secure my son and wife, and her caregiver while we fought off the forces. My family was hiding in this secret compartment in our house that we had to access underground. I immediately fought my way over there and we ended up rescusing them and then having to make it to our cars where we would drive to saftey. We drove out of the main area we lived in to this gas station where we'd meet up with the rest of my Royal Guard but this giant truck comes at us and its gunna explode and so Lee jumps out of know where and runs at this truck jumps onto it and then kills the driver jumps in the driver seat and steers it away barely managed to avoid us then climbs out the window runs along the back, and jumps from it to a car behind him as it blows up going over the ledge. This has me mad, that they tried to kill my family and we managed to capture two of their commanders during the fight and we interrogate them to find out that the Fuedal Lord is heled up a few towns over in this mountain area. So we start having over there in this giant car convoy. My wife and I leave our son with the caregiver this older asian lady and my wifes servant comes with us, this pale blonde girl and I take Lee and my right hand guard Charlie. We are walking up the street and my wife and I decide we wanted to race to the car

By this time 5 years has randomly passed. My son is about 5-6 now. My powers have fully developed after training them in the moutains for so long. We are heading out to the spa area where the men and women seperate and we hear an explosion. I panic and start sounding this alarm a high pitched noise I can make from my mouth. All of my guards run with their guns out to the womens facility and we try to make sure my wife is okay, and a police officer flags me down and I call my guard to secure the area. Everything seems fine, the police man ask if I want to check and make sure my family is okay even tho they are on the female spa side of the resort and I ask if there was someone I could task with the job of making sure that my family was currently safe since I was being respectful and didn't want to go into the womens area where they were bathing. Some really pale long haired young girl decides she'll do it, very quite kinda girl and she says they're fine.

Then I say everything is okay and we put our weapons back and are heading back to the otherside of the compound. I am talking with my dad and he goes that person looks like they may come in handy in the future, you'll be really surprised how much we've gone through these last 7 years."" And he says ""I'd like to hear it."" and we laugh. Tomorrow was the day we would launch our attack and finally win this long war to retake the area and secure our cities.

There were so many more details, but it was such a crazy dream. It actually spanned 7 years and I played out almost all of the days during the course of this dream. I started the up rising, lead the rebellion, met this girl, we fell in love, fought to free our city, captured other cities, I developed super powers, Lee turned out to be my savior when he pulled this super mission to help me rescue my family during this crazy ass hostage situation I can barely remember what happend by two people were holding my family hostage some spies or terrorist from the government and we snuck in and took em out somehow and it was this super elaborate plan that we hatched that included decoys and secret doorways tricking people

so i'm walking down this long hallway with tons of doors.. not particularly creeped out, like fuckin huge, in this big frame, bigger than poster size.. it's fascinating to me because i don't remember ever taking that photo or seeing it... i stare at it for a minute... there are all these multicolored bottles in the foreground, i look to be maybe 7-9, but i suck at guessing ages so who knows... i'm just kind of posing there, smiling, kind of pretty for a child (which i don't normally think, sometimes bearably normal

(i tend to find photos of myself as a child slightly disturbing because i don't recognize myself at all in them, it really feels like a different person. i don't remember ever really looking in a mirror much as a child either.. i don't really have a view of how i looked as a child.. all i have are old photos but they just don't look like me)

right so the fact that i was seeing this picture, i keep seeing the bottles. they've elongated to take up most of the picture. i see part of my body, my chest and arms, all looks normal except for those bottles.. keep going up... there's my smile... then ahhhhhhhhhhhhh moment of horror as i see my eyes upside down, placed right above my mouth, and i swear they're looking right at me...

look away! panic panic breathe breathe ahhhh... if i look back, i'm just creeped out by all this, everything's fine...

i look back, i don't want to look away and back again... as i stare... features start to shift a bit... i watch the smile slip slowly down, the nose following it... i look up at the eyes in panic, they're staring right at me, almost through me... i blink... those eyes blink... i look... i see the fear in those eyes that i feel in my own... the confusion, the panic, and the fact that i'm seeing this is overwhelmingly frightening.. by now in the picture my eyes have slipped down around my nose, and i know, everything melting

i wake up. keep my eyes squeezed shut. justadreamjustadreamjustadream. open my eyes tentatively. see the familiarity of our bedroom. ahhh just a dream. god i was so fucking scared for a couple of minutes. eventually i felt i had to get out of bed as i had to piss like a motherfucker, i didn't want to see myself, i felt like if i looked my eyes would be all wrong... i just couldn't get that image out of my head...

-----------

In my dream


An egyptian spirit is trying to show its interest towards me. Needless to say

I go to a museum with my boyfriend, and says that she will write on it all of the important information I need. She charges a big sum of money for this, so I decline. Sad, she still talks to me, not wanting to leave me uninformed.
&gt;
&gt;""Why is he interested in me?""
&gt;
&gt;""Because of your love for music.""

Music explodes in my ears and I run away from there. This deity scares me. He deals with things that frighten me


Me and my boyfriend are in a school. He gives me weed, but the fire consumes it whole. I am afraid I will burn the whole building, but he comes and the fire stops.

I am upset by this. He tells me not to be sad, just small ones and books. The books are weird - they all have white covers and are rather flimsy. Books and wood everywhere; music on the background. Birds as we come out.

He tells me he knows where to find answers. We go to an egyptian cafe, and I keep glancing back at them as we sip our coffees. We find no answers, only more confusion. We decide to head home.

My boyfriend stood in the living room

&gt;
&gt;""Are you alright? What are you doing?""
&gt;
&gt;""Looking at the shadows in your hallway.""


Going from the kitchen to the front door, almost hunch-backed, tails, they are all bulky but moving gracefully on their thick legs. I am terrified.

A figure appears. He has the oddest colour of hair - a dark strawberry blond, with a gentle expression. He approaches me slowly, like a scared animal. I am terrified.
All of my fears vanquish as he puts his hands on my cheeks and draws me closer to him. I feel calm and sedated.

Background: Around the time of the dream I had been suffering from a lot of anxiety which had resulted in me smoking a lot of weed in order to sleep. I have since quit this habit

The dream starts in a similar fashion to many of my dreams. I awake in my own bed and it’s still night time, as if the outside of my window has been painted black. As I begin to panic, I decide to leave my bedroom and check the other windows of the house each with the same result. I try to force the windows open but they won’t budge. The fact that I’m alone also begins to dawn on me and I start calling out for my other family members, but nobody responds. On the wall across the landing I stare into the mirror above the staircase and to my horror I can see cracks slowly forming on the mirror’s surface distorting my reflection. Out of these cracks a thick black liquid begins to seep from the mirror dripping down the wall.

I sprint downstairs to check the bottom floor of the house. Something about the house was distorted I still can’t remember what was different about it but the rooms seemed wider and taller than they should be. I look into the mirror in our living room

I’m frozen in shock, screaming in a terrifying demonic fashion.

I was riding a scooter down a road. There was sea on the right of me
I was going to visit a friend who apparently lived at the end of the road there. Which in reality, I don't know how, since I was wearing a helmet. When I got there he wasn't there, I can't even remember if there was a house there, the dream sidetracked. I met someone I used to know. My best friend from childhood. We're not that close anymore, in fact, I haven't spoken to him in years. Anyway
As we drive, we come to a part of the road that had been closed for at least 20 years. I don't know how because I just came from there. The road was blocked by a large concrete block. There was no way around since there this was a road that has woods on every side. I lifted the scooter over the block. Surprisingly this went really well. How he got his car over I do not know, the logic kind of stopped there.
The asphalt in this particular area was really worn. Long thin cracks was everywhere and holes, we come to a huge construction site, where they are tearing down a big structure of a building. Which was place where my friends grandmothers barn is.  The building was clearly not completly built, but they had to break it down. As we stood there and watch we became aware of the surroundings. Large landslides had been caused due to the unstable soil. And there is a large river maybe 30 yards from there house. As childern we were not allowed to go swimming in that river due to the rivers bottom, quick clay. Big areas in the village has alot of quick clay in the soil. The people working there prohibited us to drive any further because of the instability in the soil during the demolition. As we waited it was made clear that we couldn't pass for at least two days or so. My friend, whose house was hafe a mile from there got upset and asked if we should just walk there. Through the woods, so noone saw us. I was scared and made it clear to him that this was too dangerous and we could die if we tried. He got every upset and said that he would go alone. And I could just wait there for two days. He started walking. The terrain there was open with few trees. So one could easily spot someone there. A few minutes pass and a girl that looked very similar to the young Stark girl from Game of Thrones, but she had longer hair. I knew came and started talking. She asked why there was so much construction and so on. I  told her about the situation and that our friend had left me there. As we stood there and watched him from a distance, debris and quickly clay. Some construction workers had seen him and sounded an alarm.
Allot of commotion stirred, as we ran to her home so she could get some warmer clothes. I said to her that we need to run for the mountains, and make our way to safety from there. She was in on the idea, and there wasn't much else we could do. As we came to her house, she ran in and I was right outside. I remember thinking that I should go inside, but as I slided off my one shoe, I noticed that I didn't have any socks on. So I decided to just stay outside. Then her parents noticed me. And they asked what the hell I was doing there, I just stood there in shock. Her mother just shook her head silently giving me a wierd stare. I have no idea why. Then the girl was ready, just small tiny bushes

Everybody thought the world was going to end. It wasn't a religious fervor or anything, reality as we know it would it just fizzle out or pull apart. It wasn't just that the world was going to end; any and all existence would be completely wiped out and erased. But there was still a shade of doubt. 

It was an intensely personal dream, friend. The setting was an open, empty perfectly flat field near a small house with a severe blue sky occupied only by the sun. As the day of reckoning wore on, my stomach slowly started to unknot, and by midday I finally allowed myself to hope that the predictions were wrong, and that we would actually escape erasure.

But soon my friend asked breathlessly, it was slowly darkening and cooling to match the color of the sky. But it wasn't just getting darker. It was also that the entire rest of the world was slowly being permeated by brighter and brighter, painfully white light that also made the sun look dimmer by comparison. As this happened the sound of a terrible, rushing wind got louder and louder. As the sound and light grew in intensity, my only emotion was denial that it could be happening. That everything about anything was slowly dissolving into nothing. I kept fighting it and fighting it despite knowing that it had to be true.

I woke up completely freaked to find my door was open in real life and i felt like something was present in my doorway, i quickly got up and shut it, didn't get back to sleep that night.

Night three - I wake up to the open door with the same feelings of malevolence, helplessness and a sense of impending danger in the atmosphere but this time I see a Hooded/cloaked figure filling the doorway (We leave a light on in the hallway at night just outside my room) so the light illuminated its shape. I could feel its eyes staring at me, trying to harm me the vibration of the air became really intense and I felt like my chest was being lifted off the bed.

no signs of life and i'm confused as all hell. it looked like something out of a silent hill game except completely void of life. i just keep walking and walking and i see all the building have the windows smashed and large chunks are missing from the sides of some buildings. cars are abandoned and most are in bad shape with doors ripped off. i end up just sitting in one of the broken down cars driver seat and notice a small paper calendar sitting in the cupholder. the year was actually 2050. i end up getting really freaked out when i hear this loud hissing sound from a distance. i get up and continue walking then i stop dead in my tracks

sounds a bit like a broken steam pipe. it just gets closer and closer. i freak out and just stand there and i see absolutely nothing. the sound is right in my left ear. nothing is there. i can't move because i'm so damn scared. just hiss after hiss. nothing. absolutely nothing was next to me nor could i see anything. everything was abandoned and the fog was just growing thicker and thicker. i then freak out completely and end up waking up in a sweat and a panic attack

I had a dream that I died. I have no idea how it happened but I had been shot and was located in a moving van. I was laying down the back seat, i could feel myself dying. I've never been in that kind of situation where i black out and lose consciousness but this felt the real deal. I could feel everything becoming darker, the light fading slowly as the my hearing also began to fade. I could hear my mom crying and telling me that everything was going to be okay. I was scared shitless. After all, I didn't want to die and I wasn't fully aware that I was dreaming (or nightmare).



Before i go on, nobody can be sure, right?



Back to the dream.



The person driving took a look at me and had this expression of grief on there face and told my mother that there was nothing they could do. I was going to die in that van. 



After some time i just couldn't take it anymore and i let the darkness consume me. This is by far the scariest thing that I had ever experienced in dream. For about 15 seconds i could see, i came to and suddenly everything was filled with a dim light of a fire. I looked around and saw that I was in some sort of hut. The roof was made of straw, the floor was dirt, and there was no visible furniture. Suddenly through the door way of the hut, a woman appeared. She was a dark, indigenous looking woman with black hair and wore what seemed to be a brown, thick (probably wool), i understood it. It's weird



At this point I could not take it anymore. I began to cry. I cried and told her that I wanted to go back. I wanted to be back in my own life and in my own time. Slowly



This is by far the most surreal dream that I have ever had in my life. Makes me appreciate life a lot more and I keep it as a reminder of how precious life is. I spent more time with my family when I can and remind my mother how much i love her.

1363565065.0,1ahrwh,"Last night, I met the love of my life in a dream, then lost her... ",jblair814,11,10, and it was real in a way I don't think I'll ever forget.

In my dream, breathtaking eyes and a contagious smile and the feeling her face evoked is honestly the only thing that remains etched in my mind. I remember brief moments in time of us together, in the park, with friends, sharing intimate moments, visiting faraway places and countries I’m sure don’t exist. We were so in love and perfectly happy. I remember a feeling of absolute bliss. I’m actually crying as I write this now because the emotions are still there. I had all these memories as clear as if it was a full life actually lived.

Then, I can’t remember where or why, and I told her I was waking up. She nodded and just held me and I started to cry so hard because I knew I was going to lose her. I held her so tight because I knew these were our last moments. I could feel myself drifting back into this world, and every single memory we had together of the life we lived was being wrenched from my mind into oblivion. It was like I was losing pieces of my soul, and watching my soulmate vanish in front of me piece by piece. I kissed her as long as I could and held her tight. I started screaming in anguish, tears streaming down my face, and feeling a pain as real as if my closest companion was actually dying before my very eyes. My deafening screams settled into quiet whimpers and I awoke alone and covered in sweat. I still felt the pain though. I felt the absence – something missing. 

But here is where it gets truly bizarre. At some point last night, I forced myself to lie down and fall asleep. In this dream I had total control of everything that occurred. It was as if somehow, because I was already asleep, the boundaries of reality no longer applied and I could shape the thoughts and images I saw. In this ‘dream within a dream’ I went back to look for her. Because this dream is so many layers deep, I cannot remember the details of it, but I remember the objective clear as day, to make her real again. I remember thinking of exotic places and they appeared. Dreaming of terrible dragons and creatures and they appeared. But no matter how hard I tried

Then, but none so profound. 

This morning, the longing for a person that I couldn’t even recreate in my head. I felt again the pain that had brought me screaming back to the surface sometime in the middle of the night. Here, in front of the bathroom mirror, I cried deeply again. 

So, on a path not taken, before being pulled back into my own? 

I honestly think I will never know

I know one thing though. There’s still a tiny part of me that hopes, somewhere, I’ll see her again on the street or in a dream, and even though we have never spoken, both of us will know.

I set an alarm for 7:10 AM. Had the alarm go off and couldn’t quite go back to sleep

After closing my eyes, I was sitting down for a college class. The teacher was of Asian descent. The class was full and had 2 rows of 2 chairs per table. I was 3 tables back. The partner I had was a female. Unfortunately, I was not able to find out or ask for her name. The class was at about mid-point when things started to escalate.

As I sat there listening to the mumbles of my teacher, I also began to touch her. While she moved her hand up and down my thigh, I slowly but surely moved my hand towards hers. We both met hands around my inner thigh. She then began to gesture her pointer finger around and towards my upper thigh. Things soon began to become heated as I looked at the teacher for reassurance that he was not aware of the situation.

I now noticed that he was unaware of our little gestures, was helping around the spectacle. Within no time, I had become aroused. The emotional feeling of her playing with me during class was almost unbearable, but I managed to calm myself enough to not get over excited. I had complete control of the situation, and was able to be completely silent as to not cause anyone to notice.

The mood had begun to escalate gradually as I slowly moved my hand towards her legs. With the slightest movements, as I felt the warmth from her Vagina and a small amount of wetness. I began to massage her slowly with an up and down motion. I still felt the pure joy of her around my penis. As I started to become more rapid in movements, my second alarm had begun to ring.

At the exact moment of the sound I slowly regained my awareness of reality and lost my vision of the dream. It was 9:30 AM now. The day had already begun, I had come back into my room to try and resume what I had remembered from the dream. I moved around some pillows to aid in better neck support. Then, I closed my eyes.

When the sensation of my dream began to come back, which were mostly women. We were not sitting but instead standing as we all partook in a session of smoking. The piece, which was a bong, was around 12 inches long and was simplistic. The amount of smoke in the room was unrealistic, but the stench was spot on. It was so potent that soon after we finished, the next class was waiting outside. A woman knocked on the door. I opened it up and this is what she said, “I know what you were doing in here, she was kind enough to let us all go on our way. 

At this point, and was soon enough in a room with the same woman from my earlier dream. There were a few others in the room, but they weren’t nearly as important to her, so I cannot recollect most of them. Without warning, we began stripping down and started to make out. The room was bright, due to the window being open. The bed that we were on was soft and durable.

After a few moments of making out we were completely naked and above the sheets. With her on my body, but become faster. I don’t recall ever having cum, but in what seems like ages, we change positions and start again. After going at it for the second and third time, things begin to clear. Her face is exotic and her nose was small and pointed. With her blond hair and brown eyes, I soon realize that I have seen this face before. Unfortunately, it was just a stranger from my past.

Both of us are of smaller, and was doing the same. As she slowly put herself on me, I can feel the sensation of satisfaction and bliss as her warmth begins to start up and down once again. My hands were holding her hips as she held onto my shoulders. We went on for a while like this. Her body looked and felt real. Unfortunately, I had set another alarm for 10:45. As we were going at it, I start to hear the song from my alarm go off once again. As the dream fades, I awake from my slumber feeling refreshed and had no pain at all. I lay there for a bit, and reminisce on one of more exciting dreams

I was wandering around with a tour group of the world's presidents, and we were being shown the perfect small-scale city. It was in harmony with the local natural habitat, generated its own power, grew its own food for the inhabitants, had clothing creation and housing construction. Everything was automated, and there was no need for anyone to have money or even understand the concept.

No-one who lived there would go hungry, writers, musicians, photographers, hobbyist engineers, gamers, or anything else they wanted to do just for fun.

It was the perfect city, homelessness, and debt. The seed machinery needed to get the whole rolling anywhere in the world fit in a person's pocket, and would even work on other worlds.

After a small conference amongst themselves the important men of the world turned to the creators of this perfect city and their nominated spokesman said that they would be declining on taking a free copy of the plans for the seed machinery needed to create the city.

He said

'We don't want to be slaves.'

As I woke up I understood what he meant. Without a representation of wealth, better car and say, ""See, I'm better than *you* because I can afford a Bentley."" They couldn't swank around being the most powerful men in the world when no-one owed them anything or needed them to dictate how the economy should go.

They looked at their own imminent obsolescence as world leaders and thought of how they would simply be One Of The People again.

It zooms in oddly quick to reveal that the white spec is a very young and prominent female who resembled an older, though I've never been attracted to the middle east as a half Dutch/ half Indonesian Anglophile. She has this mysterious look on her face, as if she knows everything and yet still wonders about daily squabbles. She wears a slimming white dress made of fabric foreign to the location of the dream. After the close up of her face it cuts suddenly to somewhere in an, presumably, Arabic city. I always wondered what business she had in the market place. 

Several short and ugly troll-like men stand behind her, it was like I was looking at it from over her shoulder, as if I could tell her what to do. She never listened to me though. The door was large, had a rounded top, wooden and very very old, everything metal was dark and rusty. The thing that left the biggest impression was the lock that hung there, rusty, seemed very heavy. It also had a large keyhole but it was

1330991316.0,qjb7y,What is this I don't even...,motorstorm,11,0,1,"This morning

I woke up thinking of Silent Hill and ghosts

The earlier part of the dream I don’t remember. 

But the earliest part I do remember

After this I was holding a huge house party, sometimes they didn’t. I also requested silly string be handed out at the party and went around spraying people with it. 

Snoop Dogg was somehow the grim reaper and drove by a few times on a mini-motorbike. I was with Brian from Family Guy (....wtf) and we dove into the bushes whenever Snoop Dogg came by. I found it scary at the time but now it’s just hilarious. 

Later on I was at my own house on the backyard deck, evil-looking two story house built in my backyard. With my mental “dream-will” or whatever, I made the house burn down/explode, in slow motion. Eventually I could see that the house was built over two graves, who I somehow knew who they were and was helping them be at peace. I could see the two ghosts, who were apparently husband and wife, blue-white and ethereal and everything

I told someone, to fire some strange harpoon looking device at each grave. When this happened, some fucked up demon thing, looking like a cross between the alien dog from the Thing and the Resident Evil dogs, ran up the stairs to try and get us. It was at this point that I started confronting the fact that I was in a dream. 

My best friend was suddenly some demon-hunter vampire-slayer type badass chick

The doors on my porch IRL are glass, knowing nothing could actually happen to me, even if I perceived pain in the dream. 

By now the things looked even freakier, it’s face became shaped like something between an evil fox and a lion (complete with mane), and it’s eyes were HUGE and oval shaped with blue spirals in them, and they rolled back into its head. Totally looked like something from the Thing now. I surprised myself by sticking my tongue out at it, opening the door and slamming the head of the greyhound-demon thing a few times.

Then something REALLY weird happened. The head of the greyhound one was still stuck in the door. I took my hand

Brains flew out the other side of the thing’s head

I aimed my fingers at the scarier looking demon thing… Nothing happened. It didn’t work. 

So I closed the door, and eventually I woke up from that gradual “this is descending into something really scary” feeling.

1324679669.0,nofqf,Almost died in my sleep,t__mhjr,15,3,6,"This is all a bit hazy (and a bit long, vivid and probably life changing, but I've never lost control like I did in this dream. I'm not currently on any drugs besides caffeine in moderation

Long dream. Many different locations and phases. At some point, because my roommate is a pick up artist, and for all intents and purposes, a social savant, so I went along with it.)

When we arrive, etc.) but, being that I was in a dream and your ability to rationalize your feelings and make them congruent with your reality is difficult, I wasn't at all perplexed why there were multiple staircases, comfortable furniture in every room, and people filling rooms almost comically as if it were a regular twenty somethings Christmas party in Orange County.

My roommate is chatting someone up immediately in the far end of the room we were in, doesn't strike me as odd, and I laugh it off with the girl, telling her ""My roommate didn't give me any time to get ready!"" I finish conversation with her, or maybe she disappeared or I'm not really sure, and I left the house to get pants from my car (because everyone keeps pants in my car.) 

[As an aside

So I get to my car, are three pairs of pants. Two of them are black, one of them is light grey. I have a nice black sweater on, so (being fashion conscious, even in my dreams) I opt for the grey ones. I had to do this covertly, as there were people outside, and I don't want to be the guy that changes his pants in the street of a party, at least). I open my back door to shield myself from onlookers and I look down and the pants I grabbed are black. In fact, I just moved to Baltimore. Why am I in LA right now? *Ohhh

Easily

So, and then my body. I tell myself, I'm going to take 5 steps forward, and then I do it. I tell myself to make sure I'm in complete control (in my experience, very important) before I start fucking with things I shouldn't. I walk in the house and start exploring. In my dreams, things are always changing without my consent. The scenery, time, situations, most of things (depending on level of lucidity) will remain the same until I either A. stop paying attention or B. want them to.

I find my roommate, and I want her. I start flirting shamelessly with her and after a barrage of body language and my eradicated fear of rejection (it's a dream.) I take her into the other room and we start making out. It was fantastic and I won't bore you with the details. Afterward, she invites me to her house, and since I don't really want to wake up, and am devoid of other obligation in the dream world, I follow her. 

This is where things start to, but it's a completely different setting. Familiar in my memory, but I can't exactly remember where. Maybe the parking lot of a hotel resort of somewhere I vacationed as a kid. Seeing as how this steers far away from the conventions of lucid dreams I normally have, (change of scenery) I probably should have called it quits and woken up right there, but babes, are often a very difficult to resist variable (both in the dream world as well as reality.) I chalked it up to, ""Okay, and she tells me she lives on the next block. I follow blindly, to the right is the darkest place I've ever seen. I hear my roommate in the woods so I figure maybe he's there with the girl I lost sight of

My field of vision starts to get very constrained, but I see my roommate sitting on a tree stump, smoking a cigarette. I ask him if he's seen the girl and he says he hasn't. Along with my senses diminishing, my ability to control my body has slowly been doing the same, and it's just now becoming noticeable. I start to get scared. This never happens to me in lucid dreams. I think to myself, ""What if this isn't a dream?"" I try to wake up, I feel my real body talking. My real mouth is moving and I'm trying to wake up. I try desperately to lift up my eyelids but I can't. At this point I'm sick to my dreaming stomach. Maybe I *am* awake and lost and dying. I ask my roommate if this is a dream. He looks at me confused. I tell him that I can't control my body, trying to wake up, and he's very objective about stuff like this

I slipped deeper into a state of complete hopelessness until I became content with it. **I feel my real body stop breathing.** I can't express just how surreal this feeling is. I knew that I was asleep in my bed in Baltimore, death became wonderfully tranquil. I'm not sure if I died in the dream, but I did wake up. I'm not really sure what woke me up, but I'm going to have to do some serious introspection before I attempt to lucid dream again. I'm fairly certain now that it's possible to physically fuck up your nervous system and vital body functions by strictly dreaming, and I can't tell you how absolutely terrifying it is, and wish the experience on not even the bravest of dreamers.

**TL;DR Long realistic dream, somehow seemingly severed the link between my dreaming mind and sleeping body.**

Last night I had a dream that I was hanging around with the one of the girls that I used to have some slight feelings for. Nothing was particularly interesting, and she admitted she used to have the same feelings towards me.

We then became romantically involved within the dream

The first rape dream wasn't really me. In the dream I had an identical twin sister. We were eating lunch together, right?). All of the sudden I'm locked in a room with no windows. The door is made of steel and locked from the outside. I can hear my sister screaming. I try to get out to save her but there's no way to leave. I'm crying and begging him to stop. Then I wake up.

In the next rape dream I'm at a cafe with some friends. They are telling me to go talk to this guy that had been looking at me for some time. I feel nervous about it, he invites me to his place, I told my friends I didn't think it was a good idea but once again they talk me into it. I go back to his house and he starts to try to get intimate. I say no but he persists. He eventually rapes me. It was very vivid. I remember kicking and screaming. When I woke up I was absolutely terrified, it felt so real.

The third rape dream I had occurred just last night (and finally convinced me to seek advice). I was in some sort of large, we'll call him Joe. In real life, Joe and I had stopped talking because even though we were both in a relationship with other people, he very obviously liked me. After one incident in which he got very drunk and inappropriately grabbed my ass and tried to kiss me, I decided to end our friendship. Back to the dream world, Joe says hi and tries to talk to me. I tell him I'm not interested in talking to him and he gets mad. He tries to grab me, but I run away. He chases me down the halls and outside to a field. He tackles me and rapes me. Again

As long as I can remember I've only had nightmares. They usually come in cycles. I'll have a nightmare almost every night for a week or so, or of me dying. The rape nightmares are new, and they terrify me more than the other dreams. I should mention that my biggest fear is being raped, so that probably plays a big role in these dreams. I just want some advice on how to make them stop, or how to deal with them.

Now for the dream. I am pregnant in this dream. We start off in Walmart. I am wearing his yellow shirt from his adult softball league, when I put on the pants and drink the can of dr pepper. I am afraid people will think I am stealing so I am looking around for anyone coming at me. My husband buys a drink and we get into an old van (I think it was white) and drive off. 

We are really bored but can't go home (I don't know why)

We leave and drive some more, but we are high school age again.
We're just standing around up top, and the stairs suddenly get much steeper as I try to go down. The director keeps my husband from coming to assist me. As I am making my way down, a giant ""slender man-ish"" figure appears behind me to ""help."" I am trying to go fast enough that he can't touch me, but slow enough to keep my balance (hard to do when preggo).  A voice says ""You know what you have to do to keep me, to save me."" A few steps later, it says ""Save me! This is in you!""

Suddenly there is a loud sound that startles the figure behind me and he lurches forward. He knocks into me and I begin to fall forward. As I am in mid air, and this is on you.""

My friend, however everything appeared to be normal. We were walking down the hallway and saw a stairwell door ajar next to the ice machine. So Tyler suggests we check it out. 

All the lights were off in the stairwell except for the red emergency lights. We walk in and the air is hot and damp and there is this constant dripping noise. On the landing to the left, walks over and sits down with it. I say ""Dude, this is creepy, just take the laptop and lets go."" He agrees and when he goes to unplug the laptop, there is no outlet. The cable just runs into the wall. Tyler says, ""Hey man, just go ahead. I'll be just a minute."" Then I ask what floor we are on

When I finally reach our floor. I open the door, there is just a black abyss.
I make my way down the hallway and hear grunting from an open room. I cautiously peer inside to with a man his leg bent the opposite way. The shower is running at an unbearable volume, no running shower. No nothing. I look over and see the ice machine and enter the stairwell.

I make it up the stairs and back to tyler. A pallid, I say aloud. Again, ""Tyler"". He appears to be back to normal. ""Holy Fuck! I just saw the most fucked up thing downstairs, man."" I explain to tyler what happened and he has this look of familiarity with it. It seems weird to me, so I ask him what he was doing on the laptop while I was dealing with this guy downstairs. He says, ""Uh you know, just some stuff. Nothing important, well lets get back to the room. This place is creepy. He says, ""Whatever

To my relief, I see the black abyss. I freak out and look at the carpet, which is now a crimson red and the woman in the room is just staring at me, still impaled, smiling. 

I run back to the stairwell, ""tyler, dude we gotta leave, now! this place is bad. really really bad."" Tyler has his eyes locked to the screen and is smiling incessantly. He looks up slowly and I know that he knows what I just saw. He says, with a chilling calmness, ""I've been watching things. Things on the internet. Bad things and I like it."" His eyes move back to the laptop and I am terrified. I starting running down the stairs, flight after flight. Every doorway is filled with some horrible, disfigured bodies.

I'm at an opening to those new spin-off films that has Reddit buzzing for the past couple of days.

So queue this one guy who reminded me of Count Dooku saying something along the lines of 'Oh this is not a mere movie.' He suddenly got fierce. Dooku went and reached for his waist

The lightsaber was Spaceballs flexible

Mother fucking Dooku wraps it around the neck of the guy with the mic on stage. I don't know if the dude was the director/someone important

Everyone is freaking out. But it gets worse. And morbidly hilarious.

You know how lightsabers use cool crystals to power themselves? The crystals provide the color characteristics too? Well Dooku wanted to obtain the resources to create another saber. Maybe he had an apprentice to give the crystal to.

Did I mention that in my dream, where Dooku rips out the split in half guy's innards. Namely, his genitals.

I see we're now in sort of an upscale home instead of a wigwam. It's a huge building and the weird guy keeps leading us through confusing twists and turns

It occurs to me that the man is trying to escape us. I run after him but the twists and turns get really MC Escher-esque and he loses me. I find myself  in a room with two women in formal dresses.

I was walking through a suburban neighbourhood on a sunny day I didn't recognize the place

When I enter the house there are a few people in there

On the table there was a wooden bowl, I have no idea why.

I felt it begin taking effect right after I put the sheet back and I headed for the back door. I exited to find that the house was actually right on the beach, but you couldn't tell from the rest of the neighbourhood.

There wasn't much actual beach there, as things became more intense I noticed there was a very steep drop in the sand almost immediately in the water, then I saw it. It was a small narrow dock that extended from the sand, I had walked right past it and only noticed because I'd turned around to survey the huge drop. And at that dock there was a shark, waiting like a boat. Then I noticed the red eyes and segmented body. It was a fucking robot shark, waiting to be ridden. There was no real effort in communicating actions to it, it knew where I wanted to go and I had complete control.

This was fucking awesome, one hell of a storm was brewing. I wanted to ride all the way back to shore because of all the other sharks, but there was no way I could get back in this storm. I had to fight the other sharks.

So I did, tearing the other sharks to pieces with it's robotic jaws, it was fucking epic. It ended sometime after that, but I don't remember exactly.

I was walking down this long hallway with several people in it. I think there was a previous part to this dream but that has begun to fade already. Near the end of the hallway was a man in a costume. It sorta looked like a fat suit with a ""head piece"" so he was entirely in the suit. The zipper for it went across the top of the head from left to right. It wasn't as creepy as it sounds. I felt at first drawn to this figure slightly.

As I got closer to the figure it got a bit smaller and when I reached him he was about half sized. Not a dwarf per se

I’m not sure why but this started to scare me, me and the guy carrying the guy, still walking forward.) When I still felt the urge, I put my hands behind my back, but the draw was still there so I slowed down almost to the point of stopping. 

It was at this point tha the man carrying the guy said something like, pressing the smaller man who I was feeling an incredible draw towards against me.

Here’s where it gets a bit difficult to explain. From the moment that a large enough portion of this man’s body began to touch mine, everything. As the man touched me, I realized in my head that he was the same, another Universe that was coming into contact with mine, with me. However, he was not a different one, but the same one that I was. We were the exact same Universe down to the last molecule. Once this realization passed over me I began to realize that this whole time that I was only a shadow of a Universe. I was there but without Soul. I had the substance of the Worlds in me

The draw to this other Person/Universe was so great now that I dare not stop. We began to merge

The merging finished with an audible click sound, so large it took up solar systems. It was kinda shaped like MewTwo (for anyone that knows Pokemon). It announced that it was complete and it was whole and the feeling that washed over me was one of utter amazement and JOY.

Then I heard the man man who was carrying the other man say something like, No! No! Come back! Don’t leave me!, but I am just like a piece of skin, a piece of husk that was attached. I begin to fall away from the creature that used to be me, and it’s going further away. Everything I was is gone, and I am nothing but an empty piece of skin on the ground, screaming and wailing but no one hears me because I am not only all alone

""What if I’d gone to the center? What would I have learned? Would it have been too much

""Would it make my entire existence to that point seem transitory?”

My adventure started with me stepping out my front door to be greeted with war. The sun was locked in eclipse

From here the dream jumped elsewhere to a gruesome scene.The cultists that had ushered in Armageddon ritually sacrificed themselves only to immediately rise again with terrifying power and eyes that burned like the embers of a hungry fire. There was another to be sacrificed; a woman I didn't really recognize, gaping maw. Fangs surrounding the shimmering portal, flaming eyes resting above and accompanied by the sound of a great beast's heavy breathing.

In the time between me walking out of my door and this Hellmouth appearing I had seemingly acquired a small army of resistance fighters and crude weaponry. Shortly after the gate appeared, but that through that gate was the only chance we had to save our homes. I was the first to step through.

The other side resembled an enormous cavern that went on forever. The heat was nearly unbearable, and he fell apart into a pile of bones. We marched on, our presence seemingly unnoticed. We didn't encounter much for a very long while, until we turned a corner to face a narrow bridge (think the Bridge of Khazad-dum, but only about 15 feet above another floor) with a large creature guarding one end. This thing looked invincible and we knew we had no chance against it. Not having any fucking clue what I was doing or why I did it, I told my men to stay back around the corner. I picked up a large stone and hurled it at the beast and yelled at it, to get all it's attention at me. I then jumped down off the bridge to the floor below and led it away so everyone else could cross.

I eventually shook it off of my tail and circled back around to try and catch up with everyone. I found the bridge again and crossed, fighting off a number of small imp-ish demons that proved little more than a nuisance, I found myself looking down another long bridge, steep walls a few feet on either side, but with bottomless gaps between. Corpses of a number of resistance fighters littered the bridge. I began to make my way across, avoiding the grasping arms reaching out from the walls seeking to pull me over the side and to my death.

As I'm moving across I see Death again, catching Death off-guard again, broke him apart into a pile of bones. As he was slowly reassembling himself I was just barely able to throw off the stone lid, throw the body onto my shoulders, pocket the box, and run away as fast as I could.

On the other side, encountering zero resistance from the other humans (they ran away, we left them alone), and even stranger still the place seemed almost like a giant *greenhouse*. It was filled with plants. Some strange and alien and horrifying, some absolutely normal.

Making our way through this enormous complex we turned into a series of hallways. As soon as we stepped in we knew something was about to go horribly wrong so we started to run. Surely enough, only a dozen or so remained.

This new area we were in was very strange. There were humans walking around, expressionless. Scars on their heads hinted at cruel experimentation. Walking through this crowd a little bit I spotted something out of the corner of my eye. A girl, standing in front of a wall of rose bushes. She wasn't especially pretty (being zombie-ish and all), what drew my attention was the way she was *looking* at those roses. Like she was trying to remember something she couldn't understand. In my curiosity I went to take a closer look. There's was still something human in her, and it was sad to see. I took her hand and held it out, pulled a rose from the wall, put it in her hand and closed her fingers around it. She continued to stare at it, lost look on her face like she couldn't remember *why*. From that point on she followed behind my group

We reached an exit, mournfully. I'd never heard anything like it. Everyone woke up and just stared at her as she sang. 

The dream ended here, and I don't believe in an afterlife. However I *love* the imagery associated with it. The whole aspect of good vs. evil, dark vs. light, etc. is very appealing to me.

If I head right, i'm driving.

I stare at the hay.

Between the two stacks across from my stall is a man, watery-eyed, wearing baggy clothes the color of dirt, homeless maybe, a week's worth of beard, in a daze, or disbelief, staring right back at me

Lights are dimming, giving way to a festive faraway fife, laughing, the clop-clop of hooves on cobblestone.

The smells of bathroom antiseptic and food poisoning giving way to earthy compost, woodsmoke, manure, beer.

I dreamt this huge house that I've seen in my dreams once or twice before. It has wood finishing and floors, which was kind of trippy.
The situation was this: I'm trapped inside this house with my parents, or just someone trying to kill us specifically.
I remember looking out of the window, ridiculously scare f'n helicopter. It's starting to shoot, and it's headed right for the house. My dad pulls me back from the window just in time for the bullets from the chopper to miss me. The helicopter circles around the house and shoots at random windows here and there.

Luckily, right before a dozen very scary looking fighter planes show up out of nowhere - all targeting the anti air gun. They drop bombs at it (which look just like hand grenades, for some reason,) and we realize we're fucked. We don't wait for the anti-air gun to be destroyed, so we run to the back of the house where my girlfrlend, my mother, and all the children are hiding. We get here to find soldiers (that probably looked like Nazis in my dream, so we shoot to kill them

My girlfriend starts crying at this point, this really ugly obese man pushes me and enters the house. He is straight up ugly, and has an ugly round figure. Also, he is huge, and there's no doubt he's here to kill us.

So I run to the kitchen, I push the knife into his back - and this part felt really real. The knife taking it's time to push inside his body, and the extra force I have to apply. I do this over and over a couple of times, as he starts screaming in agony, and I can see the knife go through his flesh and skin.

He turns around, I remember all the secret doors and passages, (from my previous dreams,) and start to hide in them to develop a strategy to hunt this monster thing...

Then one of them picks up the dog, they pull the dog out. Only, it isn't a dog anymore. It looks like a baby, but with grey, transparent skin. I can see every blue vein running through its body. It looks like it's covered in some thick, clear slime. It's eyes are closed, but they look unusually large
Suddenly, and all of its flesh begins slowly turning inside out. The skin of its toes peel and curl outward, and then the rest of her does the same until she's turned fully inside out. All of her organs and muscle are on the outside. She doesn't fall apart as I thought she would. The shape of the child still holds, and blood is doing everywhere. I can see her intestines and other organs glistening as the sun's rays hit them. The inverted child suddenly falls to the ground, her skull hitting the ground with a gruesome thud. Her organs making a splat and then squish sound. She's stopped convulsing. One of the men pick up her body.

I am with some friends for what looks like to be a trip in the Saudi Arabian desert. The first thing I see is a big, going somewhere...But I'm too much in awe to really pay attention, so I look at the mountain slowly move as the bus is traveling. The night started to appear from the back of the mountain and had a blue hue. The bus felt futuristic, with small blue lights on the side of the window and on the chaid I was sitting on. I remember taking my actual phone (s3) and trying to take a picture, but as soon I tried, I felt leaving my body very quickly and transport myself high into the air. It was really fast, almost like flying, going high and seeing the smallest detail from very far. And so

I then transport myself in a different location, and then , at the horizon, I see the moon, splendid, huge, but quite different. It had huge scars, it felt it was like holding the weight of the moon. Soon

At this moment, I saw this really amazing light blue nebula. I felt like watching a Supernova. IT stood here in the night with all the stars surrounding. I thought that I  was looking at the center of the milky way. As I was looking, I saw someone else looking like me, amazed by the view, and soon enough, I notice that I am on some sort of balcony looking forward to the tower. I then decide to walk to what seems to be a city center while looking at the sky because it was so great. 

Then for some reason, the time slows down and I feel his hands tickling my left pocket and then... I woke up. I felt great the whole morning and smiled like an idiot to a few people on the street.

Behind this door that wasn't there before I find a house that nobody else know about; a secret house behind the wall. The walls are the purest white, and there's a forest green couch in the middle of the room. On the back wall is an arch doorway that leads into a white hallway but I've never been past this first room.

Now onto the freaky part
Tonight I was spending the evening at my fiances grandfathers house and after dinner we were listening to him tell old stories about the house. It came up that I had never seen what was behind this door in his dining room.

Well, or too late. I say too late

I was a young girl living in the American suburbs with my family; we had moved to America to live better lives. The summers were blistering and slow. I remember stepping outside of the house and walking along the wide, and often, the cramped, unlit living room with all of its windows open would be our place to laze about. I had perhaps 3 other sisters, but they were indistinguishable. 

Two young American business men would visit our family regularly. I don't remember why, a kind of tone that would allure people. His face was often pink from the blazing sun, and his light hair only made him look more ""American"" than ever. The second man grasped my attention. He was lean and had dark hair and eyes. It was summer, so his skin was lightly tanned. He was more reserved than his friend, and spoke seriously; this is perhaps why I was so eager to know more about him. I was young, perhaps 16, and I admired him.

Few summers went by, unlike my meek sisters, and to my parents' distaste. They suppressed me. They began to love me less, and I knew my childhood had ended. 

I was 18 in the fall when a woman openly stole my purse in the streets. After a long struggle, since many stores did not require PIN numbers. I dashed home, planning to go to the bank as soon as possible, but somehow, the dark haired man who I loved had gotten my card back again. It was incredulous. He was unruffled, he was so reserved, I wanted to thank him but also ask why he could never smile and be happy to see me.

My parents enforced rather harsh punishments, since I was more resistant than my sisters. I remember walking into the living room one day, and he was forcing my sister to pierce herself with needles on her shoulder. He saw me, and ordered me to do the same for my behaviour. I think it had something to do with our culture or religion. I obeyed, but after the second needle that had been pushed 1 inch into my skin, I yelled, ""THIS IS SUCH BULLSHIT!"" and glared daggers at my father. He quickly made to grab me, running out barefeet. I knew I could not go back. I ran down the street, and we made love. I told myself I loved him for saving me. 

From here, and became very lazy. He'd often watch TV with a beer in his hand, while I did the household chores. I realized how indifferent I was, and how sad and tired I'd become. Every day, I'd wait for the dark haired man to pick me up off my feet and save me. It was him who I needed all along. I waited, and waited, and waited, and waited every single day

It actually wasn't that scary. My girlfriend was a little scared at first and dared not to leave my side, and we couldn't control it, so we just had to live with it I guess. 

We went around just taking random cars, going back to my house, watching a movie, cuddling... It was kind of peaceful in a way.

And then I woke up. I was kind of sad, we were completely comfortable with how we lived, I don't know why, but there was just nothing compelling us for anymore. Which is weird, because in the real world I'm never one to settle for anything and constantly strive for more, but I guess that's different when everyone else is gone and you have nothing to strive for because you essentially own the world.

     In the beginning of the dream I was in a community that all lived in the same ""house"" which was made of earth built on the side of a mountain. There were around fifty people all living there

     Everyone was happy and got along and this mountain-house had a big yard with a canal around it. The roof was also a deck and part if it was enclosed like a 2nd story. People didn't cross over the canal in the beginning and everything was fine. 

     Then some people went over (the canal) and came back saying that they found paradise. So I went over to see and the people were ""plugged in"" to plants in an unconscious state and were being used by the ""plants"" like batteries like in the matrix. (The whole dream is really matrixy). I tried to go back and tell the people in our little community not to go

Suddey I'm in a different time. In a large city, I didn't know why, but they had this stack of papers with my accusations on them. 
     So I broke free of the police. The agent smith guy was the only one who could chase me because I was flying. So I would fly over one of the bombs my friend had set up and have the friend detonate it while the agent guy was near it. This happened about 3-4 times. Then the agent caught up with me. We fought for a bit but neither one of us could get the upper hand. Then he stopped attacking me and started just telling me all of my crimes/sins. It started gettin to my head and I was getting confused and dizzy and just not good. He showed me my mother crying because of what I did trying to mess me up worse. Then he decided to attack me again while I was weak. I realized just then that I had to not pay attention to what he had said or I would be destroyed. So I blocked it out; he was already coming at me with his fist cocked back ready to punch but by blocking out his mind game

Then I was in another time again. The distant future this time. It was a city in a bubble. It reminded me of those things in sim city 3000 where it's a tall structure with a bubble city on top. Everything about the place was designed to keep the people living there under control. People had their own domiciles like a little apartment. The social area looked like a mall with food stands and places to sit and socialize. There was a coffee shop type place with a fake outside view that was nice looking (the real outside was terrible with storms and bad atmosphere). There was a show room type place with music and movies that played and people could watch and it had a balcony. A lot of the place was made of glass so everyone knew they were always being watched but most people didn't care because they had a comfortable life. The colors were soft and a lot of pastels to keep a calm docile atmosphere. Something I noticed was how *clean* everything was. Not a speck of dust or smoke. The *air* was even super clean. I knew they were watching me, and seeing books on his bookshelf in his home. I also figured out how to turn my body invisible and leave my body. So one day I turned my body invisible and left it in some random place like an elevator or on a bench or something random where no one would think to look. So I left it there, invisible, and flew out the tiny air duct I found in the ceiling. I got out but I didn't know what to do so just started moving around energy and clouds for awhile. Eventually agents found my body and confronted me with a giant stack of papers. They told me that because of what I did outside there was a 0.00002 percent chance of the place being destroyed (which I understood to mean it would DEFINITELY be destroyed it would just take a long time). 

     Then they told me that they *could* let me out to fix what I had done. I immediately said ""I'll do it."" then just as fast as I said that they said

I was at the beach with a couple friends. One swam out but the tide came in quick

We were riding this bus. I tried to describe to my friend what I had seen in those waves by carving the message gently in a piece of mossy wood. I was trying to be discreet about delivering this message, because he said transmitting such messages is forbidden.

So I said fine, this fat, overtly ""hill-billy"" type woman at the front of the bus corrected me, telling me that waves didn't work like that.

At this point I saw red. I don't rememeber everything but I went off, everyone on the bus was quiet and I saw my ex-girlfriend sitting there next to me with a hurt look in her eyes. She was collateral damage from my anger even though it wasn't even directed at her. Of course! She was there all along, and this was my second, last, and only chance to prove to her that I had become a changed man and yet I failed.

I stood in this line, and lastly the punishment that came for losing my temper at the insanity of it all.

It was all here; I could see these patterns as they appeared thoughtout my entire life since childhood, the taste of blood in my mouth. This was it. What felt like my soul was starting to lift out of my tired, hopeless body. My only regret was that I would die without anyone knowing the horrible things that brought me to this point. Perhaps it was that injustice that jolted my body back to life, clutching on to the world it holds so dear, the same world that hurts me at seemingly every turn.

My analysis of this dream is all too clear. Everything that I experienced is basically a summary of tormenting patterns that have appeared in my life since childhood.

1356625881.0,15ivei,Swimming through a pyramid.....,,10,0,5,"Last night I had one of the most vivid and realistic dreams in my life.  I dreamed that I was with a bus tour in a far away country.  We came upon a pyramid which sat in the middle of this beautiful fresh water pool.  The pyramid itself was so detailed.  Grey stones wrapped in moss and vines.  Our group proceeded to enter the pyramid; you had to swim up to it and then climb atop a stone wall and slide down this smooth rock face with a waterfall going over the top of it.  A few of us jumped down the waterfall and proceeded to swim into the pyramid.  The rest stayed behind at the entrance with a group of children.  The group that entered with me began to split off in twos; swimming through different pathways within the pyramid.  Even though I remained on my own pathway I could still somehow see and follow the other groups as well.  I had one person with me a man with a beard.  We swam down this dark corridor in the pyramid when all of a sudden we came to an iron gate with a large stone castle behind it (all of this was still inside the pyramid itself).  The man with the beard informed me that this was the former palace of the tribal king which built this pyramid and that out of respect we should swim by quietly without splashing about.  That's when all hell broke loose.  Two headhunting tribesman appeared out of the shadows, however the rest overwhelmed him and dragged him off into the dark screaming.  Then I saw what was happening to the group waiting at the entrance of the pyramid with the group of children.  They were all happily playing and splashing about in the water when a group of tribal children snuck up behind them and pushed them one by one into the pyramid.  At this point I returned to my own situation inside the pyramid.  I was being hunted.  My location had changed to a place in the pyramid where it was very wet but no longer had enough water to swim.  I was now entering a great room which was divided by two pools and a large walkway between them.  I was told by a booming voice which I could not locate in the darkness to choose a pool and jump into it.  I guess I chose the right pool because after some length of swimming found myself leaving the pyramid and back outside.  The weather was so warm.  The mood had somehow changed from one of fear to one of overwhelming joy.  I exited the water and found myself next to our tour bus where people were taking pictures with the headhunters and posing as if they were about to be killed by them.  The place had been one elaborately designed tourist trap (like a theme park) and no one in my group had actually died.....Or did they?  Right before I woke up a man in a white suit handed a briefcase to one of the tribal headhunters and said thank you and began speeding off in a convertible laughing.  Seated next to him was one of the girls in our group.   Inside the briefcase was the head of the bearded man who was swimming with me.  I woke up right after this moment.

**tl:dr semi-cheesy love story**

I (guy) was at a softball game at my roommates university in the city (chicago).  It was a blowout game and the coach of their team was an incredibly loud and angry man. The third base(wo)man was having none of it. She walked off to a near by bridge over the expressway. 

I followed her. Her body language screamed ""I'm going to jump"". I had to stop her. At this point in my dream I actually felt myself take her and keep her from the edge. I felt the hug that my dream-character received. She felt undernourished; she felt in danger. 

I had taken her back to what it seems was her own apartment/dorm. I made food and she was grateful. I don't think I've ever seen anyone so happy to see something I cooked. We proceed to one of those lounge areas where we get a chance to just sit and talk for a while. 

We talk about life for a while and lose track of time. It's storming outside and she suggests I don't try and make it back home. When I agree our eyes meet. Now

My dream progressed through dates

But of course

Her father got wind of her relationship and told the school elites/professors. This was not acceptable in their eyes. This athlete, was not to be involved romantically with someone like me. What they had against me I don't know, but that didn't matter. All they wanted was to see me out. 

When we were together thing were changing, kisses. I was missing her face, her smile. 

And everything they did was working. 

I found myself more alone. No more wandering the city with my wonderful companion. No more smiles

It's a few months down the road; I still miss her. It's a new softball season though, siblings are there congratulating the team on their win.

And then I see something that sinks my soul. There's another guy. And he's with her. I felt my heart drop as I see them hug in the same spot that I first saw her. I couldn't take it; I had to leave. 

But what other place could I go to? There wasn't anywhere else in the world that seemed like it would make me happy again so I went to the only place I could think of...the bridge.

It starts up with this view of a brown haired boy holding a small dog. It was brown and possibly a beagle. It looked drawn

Black, orange and blue striped. 

They were at a door way of some shop, bright all the same. 

The boy starts throwing a stick. The dog

That went on for some time. Also

The music stopped.

The dog had rammed face first into the boys stomach and everything changed into a more anime-like style. The boy, an intestine in his jaws. The dog pulled back and stared back at the ""camera"", now in a different style. The boy was leaned over and I heard the first speech in the hole dream.

""Oh, chuckling and petting the dogs head. 

He watched as the dog chewed on the organ, and some person on the other end was moving the dog and the boy's hand. After a moment, the dog twitches and bites the boys hand. 

The boy opens his mouth but the dog decayed, then pink, then brown. The boy dropped him and my view shifts. I am now looking through the dog-corpse's perspective. Although it feels like a mere minute, it seems years have passed. The boy leaves the shop and comes back in, this time as a haggled old man. The man had hyper realistic features, and hobbled his way over. I could almost feel what was about to happen next, I was *willing it*. 

He reached over and grabbed the dog's head, it was black and red. ""Oh, you're decayed like my dog. My dog decayed like you. Crusted, cooked, baked..."" his voice was the stereotypical old-man voice. It was croaky, yet I could sense the malice inside.

When it's time to wake up

When I'm trying to wake up

I just pass in and out of consciousness, then my eyes open again and I feel tired, don't feel like getting up at all, then suddenly a few more dreams, then I may wake up, and it's back into dreams again. It would eventually end, but not usually before I'd be horribly late for something

since I'm semi-conscious

Almost every one of the string of dreams are short and random, but not often. 

I'm only saved by the fact that I usually stay in the semi-conscious state and thus have chances between the dreams to snap out of it while my eyes are open. And no, just in a bit of a sleepy daze. I do occasionally slip into the sleep state though, and before I know it an hour or more has passed. If that doesn't happen, then I could have 4 dreams and be like FUCK I'M LATE and realize only 15 minutes passed, I'm still safe.

**edit:**  

The strange part is that I've read that dreams don't really start until at least an hour or so into sleep, and I decided I'd go to bed at around 11:00PM, not too early, not too late. I specifically didn't want to sleep too early, like at 9:00PM because I knew I'd likely wake up at 1:00AM wide awake. So I went to bed at around 11:30PM 'cause I couldn't really keep myself up any more. I was also sore and felt like I had a cold coming on. Falling asleep was almost instant, I was just so tired I closed my eyes and put my heavy head down.

I then had a wonderful sleep complete with some long and almost entirely coherent dream that I don't remember anymore, that I had a wonderful full night's sleep and to top it off, I was no longer sore, just refreshed and wide awake!  

I thought to myself ""I guess I'll get ready for work, then It hit me. I was dead tired, and only slept for an hour after that, then I had to work, putting me back at square one.

1340826339.0,vp965,[Dreams Library] How to remember your dreams.,RadOwl,14,5,2,"This is an excerpt from my book ""Dreams 1-2-3: Remember

Suggestions for dream recall:

1. Use a dream journal and keep it by your bedside or wherever you sleep. I use the same notebooks for making lists and taking notes, but the dreams will come. As I’ve learned through trial and error, the unconscious, dreaming mind is an eager partner in my dream endeavors, but I have to be willing and able to give my dreams the attention required. If I’m too busy in my waking life, my dreams backlog the material until I’m ready.

2. Tell yourself before sleep that you want to remember your dreams. Really tell yourself. Say it like you mean it. If you’re a spiritual person, so by reviewing your dreams you cue your mind. It’s also possible to recall an entire dream after remembering only a snippet, if you keep your mind clear when first waking. Implant the suggestion that you not only want to remember yourdreams but will.

3. Make time to write down your dreams. When I’m in a busy environment I retreat to the bathroom first thing in the morning. However, but you might. You can be “selfish” about giving yourself these moments to start the day right, because there is nothing at all selfish about eforts to live your dreams. The more you practice the better you’ll become at remembering. Use a voice recorder if pen and paper aren’t handy. The act of writing with pen and paper is a physical cue that can stimulate dream recall by “getting in the flow,” but do whatever is best for you. Recall was difficult and tenuous for me at first — the dream memories vanished if not written down immediately — but with practice I could wait long enough to start up my computer (back in the days when computer booted up in minutes, not seconds).

4. Return to

5. Write your dreams in the present tense. Instead of “I drove to the store and bought a pizza, “I drive to the store and buy a pizza.” Present tense is a mental cue, a mind hack. I learned it while writing Dreams 1-2-3, and found it helps to think of a dream as an active memory, a present situation described in the present tense, making it feel more immediate.

6. Meditate. A clear mind, so a peaceful walk counts. I find that the concentration required to practice Pilates is meditative. Meditation is a very broad term, and people get hung upon “doing it right” rather than just doing whatever feels right.

7. Be patient. The memories are never lost,False,,t5_2qmbx,1340826775.0,,,t3_vp965
1339061178.0,upjnc,I used to have a recurring dream that had dream logic so far removed from physical possibility that I can hardly describe it. What's the most physically impossible thing that has happened in your dreams?,Benevolent_Overlord,10,2,9,"When I was younger I used to have a recurring dream that was very unique and happened exactly the same way every time. The strange part of this dream is that it is difficult to explain because I simply lack the words to describe it. I wonder if I was dreaming primarily in my language dominant hemisphere without much crossover...? Or maybe my brain just was imagining something physically impossible such as a strange number of dimensions.

The inexplicable part is that time, yet in the dream I had to play a game that was based on moving quickly to somewhere far away and back again along the same path before something crossed the path and took my spot. - Like I said... Doesn't even make sense.

Years later I still remember this dream fairly clearly. I dabble in lucid dreaming, sometimes I'll have waves of deja vu where it feels like I'm almost going to slip into this old recurring dream. I haven't actually had the dream for years and years though.

I'll try to explain the dream to humor you. It sounds like something a schizophrenic would say...

I'll start with the setting

It started with a sense of unease and urgency. I knew that Something Bad would happen if I was unsuccessful. I did not have a body. I floated in space. There were never any dream characters

What the objective of this game was is difficult to describe... Something to do with moving very far in no time at all. The closest analogy I can think of is that I started at the beginning of a tunnel similar to a highway tunnel through a mountain. There are many highway tunnels in all directions all on top of each other. The objective was to go so fast down the tunnel that it takes no time at all and end up back at the starting point. Somehow this involved going in a loop without being anywhere along the loop. And there was always the danger that something else would do it faster than me and take my spot. - Like I said before... Makes no physical sense.

Anyways... Anyone else have something that pushed physical impossibility so far that it is nearly indescribable?

1333179730.0,rm5x8,I had a lucid dream.,hex498,10,2,3,"So a few months ago I had this lucid dream. It really bothers me to this day and now I've finally found a place to talk about it. I'm on a cell phone so some words may be wrong. Sorry if it's a bit long but i would really like to get some feedback. I am 13 if it makes a difference to the sense of the dream.

So the basic structure of the dream goes like this. I start off by waking up in my bed. Everything is the same. I do this repeatedly and the whole time i believe that it is real life. If it makes any difference, but everything just keeps loading forever, this signals a dream state, i did not have my phone and i usually get good reception. I keep reawaking about 7 times total. One time when i wake up, i wake up in a straw bed in a small hut. It feels natural because it is a dream. I go outside and cross the street. The area kind of has long streets and two story buildings. The buildings are like warehouses except with windows and no gaps between buildings. The hut is next to the sidewalk in a fenced area. It is a sunny day. After crossing the street i find my mother drying clothes on a clothesline. She seems very rushed and kind of ignores my presence. She responds when i speak and answers my questions, but does not look at me directly. She tells me that we have to get ready for some kind of festival. It is now that i notice bright flags and banners above the streets and on buildings. She quickly walks inside a slightly bigger hut with no windows but with invisible lighting. There is a table with clothes in the middle of the room. I go to the other side and start to wonder about her strange behaviour. I finaly get a look at her face and notice that her eyes are a bit more droopy than the real her. I now realise that i'm in a lucid dream. I wonder if i should experiment with things or see what happens if i ask ""mom"" about the dream. I remember noting that there could be many risks in signaling that it's a dream. I decide to as anyways. I say to her ""mom, i need to ask you a question."" I ask many times. She keeps avoiding the question many times by talking about how we must get ready for the festival. Finally she stops and says ""what do you want,""is this... a dream. Are we in a dream right now? Are you my mother or is my mother sound asleep in her bed?"" 

This part is crucial and sort of strange but every bit is true.

She then disappears. Everything turns red and everything just feels generally evil. The best word i would use to describe it is demonic. I then say to myself, (i kid you not) i summon a lightning sword for defense in case anything bad comes through the small doorway of the hut. I leave the dream and wake up in real life. I noticed before that in the dream, when i had to get up from my straw bed, my knee did not make a cracking noise like it usually does. I got out of bed and tried making the noise to be sure that it was real life. It was. I was too scared of the demonic scene to go back to sleep. 

I would really like to talk about this dream with someone else. I have decided that if i get another lucid dream, talking about it would be much apreciated. 

Does anyone know what the purpose of the festival might have been? 
Where was everybody else?
Why did everything become demonic?
What made me choose a lightning sword as my weapon?

Any answers or feedback would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance!

As a kid, and look at the door leading to the hall.( I always felt like I was awake so that's why this may not be considered a dream, sorry if this doesn't go here.) These times that I would wake up, there would be a half man, half wolf silhouette standing in the door frame. I was never afraid of this silhouette, I just knew he was there and knew for the fact that he was half wolf. At this time, I had no idea what a werewolf was. The first werewolf show I ever saw was ""Big Wolf on Campus"" a few weeks later so I don't believe I manifested this silhouette from any pop culture reference.

Let's jump forward 14-16 years and I'm sitting at a table with my sister, and I disclose that I use to see something standing in the door frame. Before I could describe more, my sister butted in and asked if it was wolvish. Obviously after saying yes, she opened up and saw a wolf man watch over her too. My mom then said that when she was real little that this silhouette also stood in her door frame.

1.  The apocalypse as described in the Bible is literally true.  Watch out for Horsemen.

2.  There always has been a fear of the destruction of the world.  Most recently the Kohoutec Comet and then Y2K.  I was there.  Nothing happened.

3.  The apocalypse as described in the Bible is symbolic

Symbolic of what

A new understanding of God and the spiritual is taking place in the Western world.  

The last time this happened was the birth of Christianity

And as the new is emerging, Earth climate destruction, and of course, the zombies.  (They did rise from their graves, but were destruction, not salvation.)

The more we pay attention to these images and what they carry

1320086509.0,lvgas,Dream recall tips as the veil thins....,dreamUnraveler,11,2,3,"So

1) Awake slowly... being jolted out of dream state by an alarm clock isn't conducive to helping conscious awareness get in contact with remaining tendrils of waning dream state.  So, and slowly... don't even open your eyes or move your body... just lay there for a few minutes... try to recall any tiny bit of the dreamscape, feelings, images, etc... once you get a handhold in the dreamscape, you can wiggle your way in deeper, and deeper into fuller recall.

2) Journal your dreams... even if you only remember a bit... it's a good practice.

3) Always record your dreams in first person present tense as much as possible... So, and can help provide a cascade of dreamscape detail recall.  Also the first person present tense perspective is more conducive to extracting valuable interpretation.

4) Have fun with it... sometimes you'll get it

5) Practice... as with all things will improve.

Enjoy...

My main concern is that, or do other things to me that a father should not do to his daughter. I do have serious daddy issues, and many real life memories. I just want them to stay out of my dreams. In dreams, anything can happen, right? 

I should probably mention somewhere around here that my father killed himself about a year and a half ago. In real life. Since then, but now more often than not, he comes in the form of someone else. Like he's possessing them. And when he is possessing them, I sometimes see him in the background, looking all zoned out like an empty shell of a person. It's really creepy.

Anyway, my father gets closer and closer to murdering me. Last year, I dreamed that he had my sister and I in his car and was driving us out in the bush to kill us, and I had to watch my sister die before I woke up. 

Now for the past 2 weeks, my party (usually family members, once my father was there himself) and I start planning a road trip, and as the nights go on we get closer and closer to getting out there to our destination. It's always someplace wild looking, like a little cottage by the water or an open field full of free looking people. 

4 nights ago, still screaming and crying. My boyfriend was there and said I'd been screaming for at least 45 seconds before I actually woke up and he didn't know what to do. Since then, my dreams have been leading up to the same point, but luckily there's always something that happens in the real world to wake me up (the cat jumps on the bed, my boyfriend accidentally sets the alarm too early..) and then I just stay up. So now I've just been staying up late and waking up early to keep myself from having to experience it all over again.Last night cut it really close, where my father possessed my mom and she had a rope out and was ready to jump at me. 

If anyone knows about anything that could help me with this

Is there some sort of drug I could take, but she really wasn't into it. I guess they effect me so much because of my photographic memory. Everything seems so real and important when I wake up.

It was a large buffet with all kinds of food and people were shoving food in their mouths like they hadn't eaten in ages. Everyone was obese and if they weren't obese I could see them slowly growing larger and larger and ballooning as the costumed characters ran back and forth to the buffet for them to get them more food. Most of the people sitting at the tables eating had snub upturned noses and snorted a bit while they shoved food into their mouths.

A family of four was sitting in one of the booths and the father and mother were shoving food into the mouths of their toddlers strapped tightly into ""child seats"" at the table.

In the corner sat a bunch of characters that I hadn't noticed before, the cow was shoving hamburger after hamburger into his mouth and the chicken was devouring chicken wings. I first noticed the pig who was sighing and sobbing and when I walked up to the table, I noticed that all of them were crying so hard that the food on the table was soaked with their tears.

I had one this morning around 4am. I was dreaming and then “woke up” to find my friend lying on the bed next to me. I then proceeded to have a conversation with her about my dream. 

All of a sudden a vampire midget appeared and began climbing up the bed. I was going to yell to her to look out for the vampire midget, at which moment the vampire and my friend disappeared.

It wasn’t like I was jolted awake or anything when my hand hit my nightstand. I saw it connect and I had an unbroken stream of consciousness from when I swung to when my fist connected with the nightstand.

I then laid there on my bed for a while, yet still terrified of the possibility that the little bastard might come back.

I remembered the IAMA thread about the woman who was a paranoid schizophrenic and the goat hallucinations saying that it was a very bad idea to interact with the hallucinations. “Shit!” I thought, that I was in my own apartment and needed to man up. I thought for a moment if Zoloft might cause hallucinations, since I took 100mg of that before bed, but I’ve never had problems in the past.

I’ve had these periods every once in a blue moon. They’re always different, dreaming.

I never have this issue when I’m awake. I never hallucinate when I’m fully awake. I don’t hear voices in my head. I have no mental health issues aside from some depression. No history of mental illness in the family.

This morning I woke up crying after a weird dream.
I'm a male of 25 years old and normally barely cry.
I wouldn't say I'm the happiest person at times

I can't remember everything, but that's all over now. We still talk once in a few months, but just as friends. The friend in question also has anorexia and a lot of problems with her parents(drunks). 

So we were swimming randomly until we came to a slide thingy which was very dangerous. It could go very wrong and she could drown. But only one person at a time could enter and nobody could see what was happening. For some reason I was scared it could go wrong, which made me happy.

So I was waiting for her return
Luckily she made it, me, all the problems. At first I thought this was a bad thing for her, because she made such good progress with her self-esteem(doing the dangerous slide thingy on her own). But then I noticed she was doing even better then normal, she didn't know anything anymore of her problems and was just really happy with no bad thoughts what so ever.

Then I really felt sad because I couldn't feel that way. Woke up
(Anyway I think that was the reason why I felt sad)

It was all really random and weird, but the emotions were quiet heavy.

Does anybody experienced such things as well

The rooftop door opened again and a clone for each person came down the stairs. With everyone in a panic, by herself. I ran over to do something, but I didn't know what. It was my sister. Clone or not, I had no clue, but I couldn't retaliate. I just stood there in shock.

I left home and arrived at my first layover destination which was familiar

After a short stop, but fun exploring the new concourse. Something seemed out of place, outside of it being new to me...everyone seemed...different.  Everyone was more friendly.  I actually felt a higher level of tolerance from others in my dream, it was really comforting!

I asked an airline employee behind the desk where I was

Immediately I panicked.  No passport. Work in 48 hours. No one knew where I was.

It was a strange panic

After a bit of reacting to the news, and France.

Finally she introduced me to a gentleman who asked for my credit cars and was delighted to tell me he found a plane trip immediately back home for 500 dollars.  I was a little disappointed because I wasn't expecting to spend this

Coincidentally my dream never touched on the passport issue again and I just left.  Not sure how I made it there or back

But that's it.  If you like reading dreams hoped you like it!  It was one of my favorite recent dreams.

I go back to that big room and stab at the woman. I miss and she pulls a knife on me. I disarm her Assassin's Creed style. I then stab her with all three knives.

The killer was a overweight kid, he just reported 'My mind is made up' and pushed me away. He handed me and the friend I was with bottles of poison and told us that that was how we would die. Each other person would be killed in different ways.

This is when it got really weird - I remember thinking 'If I die in this dream, half awake.

Basically, vivid sexual dream.  It wasn't a wet dream (never had one) and when I woke up I wasn't even terribly aroused. 


Simply put, and preventing family members from interrupting.  I was completely unembarrassed and played the role of the submissive guy, willing to appease her utterly.  I remember like, double checking with the girls around to make sure I was doing an ok job.  The sex was also somewhat exploratory in nature.  I don't remember her face, but I feel like I've seen her/known her, from considerably far back in my past.  I remember she had red hair and was wearing a sweater most of the time.  I didn't have an orgasm in this dream, I should add, the other girls blocked the door and said we would be right down so the family member was none the wiser.  Shortly after that I woke up.


So here's why I'm sort of WTFing about this:  I am gay.  In fact, although I have with guys.  Left with just my imagination (no porn) it's basically impossible for me to masturbate/climax while imagining sex with a girl.  So this dream has me really scratching my head.

... doll parts.

So I pick up this translucent arm  - it was like the size of a banana I guess. It was sort of see through and clear. It was slightly luminescent with a whitish glow.

I kept trying to put the little baby hand on my finger to like get it to grip my finger..You know how babies grab your finger with their whole hand? Like that.

But it wouldn't move. It was just like a doll.

So I held it in my palms which turned neon blue

Over and over. I felt it. I felt the pressure and the warmth. It was very vivid.

I’m a young writer and I have an idea for a story that revolves around the phenomena of dreaming. Now, and what they experience during their dreams. I know the Reddit community is vast, intelligent and wise. I want to research and learn more about people’s dreams. I have a few questions for you dreamers. 

1.	Explain your dream world. What does it feel like to dream? Is it always the same

2.	Do you think there is an interaction between the dream world and waking life? If the dream world could have any influence or power over the waking world

3.	Have you ever had a profound dreaming experience? Please explain it to me: how did you feel

4.	What do you believe is the purpose of dreams? Mysticism aside

For legal purposes, and I somehow become well-known for this novel,  you are forfeiting the right to sue me for ANYTHING. If these circumstances are unfavorable to you, then please don’t post a reply. It is not my intention to steal anyone’s ideas, or capitalize off of other people's ideas; I am here for research and curiosity. I am looking for inspiration. Dreams are so intangible and inspiring, perhaps you can help shine light on a facet of the mystery?

I want to thank you all for sharing your experiences with me and helping me understand the dreaming world more in depth. I know that there are more to dreams than I can ever comprehend. I’m excited to hear what you have to say.

We hadn't seen in each other in a solid 2 months, but were very mean over texting and the phone all the way through May. June was our first month of really not talking, and I blocked his number from contacting me. He was facing 25 to life for cocaine charges and the day of his court date (July 3rd) he decided to commit suicide.

That being said

Last night while going to bed

The last time I physically saw him, that he had court the next week. So we did, and we cuddled on the couch and had a great conversation. It wasn't fatalistic conversation about his future. He simply wanted to visit and was very affectionate. Jesus had a very hard time opening up, so his actions seemed to be coming from a higher vibration if that makes sense.

I felt like I was awake through the whole dream and I woke up energized like crazy. It was powerful, but not directly. Like we were communicating through the atmosphere of the dream and not semantically. Just on a soular level.

TEETH

Dreams about teeth are common and tend to have one of four meanings:

1. You need to see a dentist. The first meaning to consider is the literal one. If you dream of your teeth decaying or an infection in your mouth

2. Teeth ground down often indicate internalized stress or anxiety

3. Teeth are related to social perception -- there's no quicker way to judge someone's social position than by the condition of their teeth. Missing teeth -- especially front teeth -- are associated with rednecks and po' folk

4. Because teeth are in the mouth and words come from the mouth, reckless speech or lying, and loose teeth can symbolize this idea.

As with all dream symbols

1329072592.0,pmafd,I think my dreams try to force me to stay asleep. Every one thinks my dreams are bizarre. Help?,FaustTheBird,8,1,11,"By the time I reached adolescence

* I was in a summer class, but that my eyes were closed. I kept trying to open my eyes and every time I did, everything was blurry. Finally, I managed to open my eyes, and I awoke from my dream with my eyes closed. Then I really opened my eyes and paid attention in class again.

This sort of thing has continued to happen to me. I used to sleep with a beeping alarm clock. Then all my dreams incorporated the beeping. So I switched to a radio. Then all my dreams incorporated the music. The only thing that worked was putting the radio dial between two stations so that I had static and 2 types of music. That worked for a while. Then I started turning off the radio in my sleep and not knowing it. So I moved it across the room. Then I started having new dreams:

* I would wake up, I would wake up from the dream thinking that I was pretty much ahead of schedule since I was already dressed and packed. And then I'd realize I was in bed in my PJs and the alarm is blaring and has been for over 30 minutes!

I would have dreams where someone is talking to me and talking to me, the context of the words changes to allow the words of whomever is trying to wake up to enter my consciousness. An example would be that I was speaking to someone in a dream about saving an aboriginal tribe and how important it was and they went on a long diatribe and I interjected at some point. Their response was ""Oh yeah? Well, you know what? You know what? It's time to get up!"" Time to get up! I was being woken up by someone who was saying ""It's time to get up""

The weirdest one in recent memory was when I fell asleep on a hammock, so I sat straight up. Then my eyes closed involuntarily and I was lying on the hammock in the same position. So I tried again, same result, sat upright, fell back asleep, woke up in the same position. Did this one more time and decided I needed a new plan. So I started to slowly sit up and grab onto the hammock to pull myself up and hold on. 3 times during that process my eyes closed involuntarily, but when I re-awoke (in the dream still) I was holding on to the hammock ropes so I wasn't on my back. I finally sit all the way up, on my back

There's so many more though. I've dreamt 3 nested dreams in. I've dreamt seemingly entire days of regular life. I've dreamt making decisions and sharing them with others and believing I actually did that for days until it comes up in conversation and it never really happened. I've been in class and watched the room vibrate as though I was in REM while still semi-conscious. I've had brake lights fly at me only for me to kick the chair in front me trying to push on my brake pedal. I respond to questions once I pass out.

Deb (my old manager)

Next scene: Me and SeaQuest-kid wake up and look outside the top story window.  Instead of the predators being in those cages, horses, etc).  WE FREAKED.  The predators were loose!

Next scene: This is the part where things get exceptionally out of whack.  The gorilla, wolf, and chimps were reaking havock on the city.  Evidently they were intelligent enough to be sneaky and make plans, but they were also vicious and strong enough to kill everyone they saw.  Me and SeaQuest-kid held hands as we ran through the city, trying to avoid the Beasts, the panicking people, and the gangs of thugs who found this to be the perfect time for thievery.

Next scene: We are in a school.  This school has been in many of my past dreams, with the sounds of people screaming behind us.  We finally get as high as we can, which turns out to be a boys bathroom.  Bunches of people are hiding in there.  So SeaQuest-kid and I lock the door, which is almost immediately followed by the door being pounded on by the beasts.  I ask the hiders if there are any windows.  You know those tiny windows that are in some bathrooms, way high up?  Yeah, they had those.  So I finaggle the window and get it open where, miraculously, and on the other side are roofs similar to steps, and panic!  Because inside my coat is my ex's dachshund

Next Scene: SeaQuest-kid and I are walking through the everglades., when the Beasts have destroyed our way of life.  The guy we come across is the guy from Jaws (who was also on SeaQuest)... he's not very thrilled to see us, but he lets us come in to his home anyways.  I meet a woman, and it turns out, they are wildlife specialists, and they have taken it upon themselves to track the beasts!  Me and SeaQuest-kid reluctantly admit that we know the animals really well, and we would like to help.

Next Scene: We are on a LARGE everglades-boat thingy (I cant remember what they're called) with a ton of people, this meant that the python was there.  Just as the people in my dream came to that conclusion, the boat started rocking, people started screaming...

In defiance of his request, I ran to the elevator and hit button 31 on the elevator panel, and suddenly felt immense G-forces pushing on my stomach as the elevator shot down into lower levels (sort of what you feel as you descend on a roller coaster).

Having one is no surprise. Not having one is an unusual night. More often

Sometimes the dreams are less fantastic and forgettable.

Once in a blue moon

Rarely

The latter just so happened Saturday night

The dream setting took place in my bedroom, was where my clothes dresser resides now. On the cubby walls were papers of schedules, dry erase boards, posters- it was obviously my work area. The other wall lined by my book cases, connected perpendicular to this wall with the door into my room, was also extended. The ceiling was altered the most, having been lifted by at least half a story. 

For some reason known only to my dream-self, beams, nails, chalk notations left from construction, and ultimately the backside of the adjacent wall could be seen. Large and rectangular, it was too high above the floor for me to reach up into.

A few “days” passed in this dream with no happenings.

One “day”, leaning over to write on one of my schedule papers posted on the wall facing the hole. I recall nothing of what I gabbed about, sans that it was mundane. 

“Hold on a second. I want you to come here and look at this

I move from my bed to take a gander.

On the paper, but something was terribly off. 

It was a moment in which you look at an image, with a half grin that only those with demonic intent could give.

“Now, “Look up, slightly to your right, into the hole…”

I did so

The figure was looking back at me. 

It’s very existence looked smeared. The longer I looked at it, not even the entirely of the body could be seen. 

But it’s face. 

It’s face was strikingly easy to perceive. No eyes. Demonic half-grin. 

And the worst part about it-

No. I stared for a moment

“That’s just an illusion of the wires and chalk mess left on the walls. It just looks weird it all in the darkness of the hole

And that was that. 

“Days” went by in this dream. I recall disturbing feelings wash over my more frequently as time continued forward. The ‘figure’ was still there

Time leapt within this subconscious state, in my room which was now only lit by the pale dying light of twilight. From this position, I could not see the hole as it was up above me to my immediate left. In front of me standing in the middle of my floor was my dog, looking distressed. He was barking indefatigably at the hole. This lasted for a few moments. I only sat and watched, silently, awash with stress and concern. I recall feeling as if I had just been forced to the ground moments prior, leaning back on my elbows for support.

It was then

I heard movement in the hole.

Immediately

Instantly, who stood outside with her car. 

“We have to go. Now

My cell phone blarred and I awoke with a sweat. Without hesitation or logic, of course. I sighed and felt it was best to wake if it meant not reliving that dream.

-----

Earth seems to have been invaded overnight by huge air-dwelling jellyfish-like creatures, producing strange visions and hallucinations, and being stung perpetuates these visions. The jellyfish also seem to mimic human mannerisms after a while, such as basic tendril motions (waving, clapping, etc), and also mimic human speech patterns, hollow jibberish. (Mockingly? I don't know.)

VISIONS:
I look down at my hands, alien.
I look up, beckoning to me. It's like the jellyfish are trying to tell me who killed her.
The walls around me are made of tiny
Extremely intricate and extensive 'tower-like' 'illustrations'... constantly moving, with sour notes and intrusive sounds thrown in. I find these images thrust before me, and I am forced to examine them.

Apparently there are now enough of these jellyfish inhabiting Earth to cause panic among the populace. People are in a state of riot and mass disorder, the countryside... people who have been stung show massive red marks on their skin, wandering about in an unseeing haze while the jellyfish sting them to death and laugh about it. I get the distinct impression that the jellyfish find us 'cute'.

I had a pretty normal dream for most of the night last night, very vivid sequence. It came totally out of the blue: I don't watch cartoons, I'm a thirty-year-old woman and don't have much exposure to trippy shit like this. Very out of the blue.

I was a very poor, I found that there was a very steep gorge next to it, a crack in the earth, and took care not to fall into it or get too close.

I couldn’t repair the dish: no matter how I tried, and get it hidden somewhere: I saw that there was a car coming very far off on the road, so I hurriedly stuffed the pieces of the satellite dish into the basket, climbed on (with a lot of difficulty) and set off up the road.

Quite suddenly, and I noticed a very old pile of shoes in one corner: one set of shoes, a rotten pink silk pair that looked like something from a museum, had the number 1548 embroidered on them: I took that as the date that the shoes had been made. Another pair nearby were covered in a green slime, and I thought I saw part of a human foot somehow still attached to them.

And then, because the masonry and glass started raining harmlessly down all over everyone, the ceiling broke up and gave way: beyond the ceiling I could see a gigantic figure of an Egyptian god soaring up into the sky, rising up right near the building, at least 200 feet tall.

1369601774.0,1f3lg9,New found love. Blood-colored sky. Voices in my head. Apocalypse imminent.,Stiddlefrix,7,2,2,"About an hour ago

I was in Wilmington, someone placed their hand on my shoulder and spoke softly ""Beautiful, isn't it? It has been getting redder every morning for the last week."" I turned around and standing behind me was the girl I am beginning to fall in love with in real life. For story purposes, we'll call her Madeline... except in the dream, it felt like I was meeting her again for the first time. 

A brief period passed where I'm not sure exactly what happened, about 60 miles away. It turns out, Madeline's mother was running for mayor of the city. Anyway, after a night of strolling along the beach front, it was like falling in love with the same person all over again. I can still see a high-definition picture of what her face looked like when we stopped and started holding each other on the beach. The next morning, the sky was now a blood-orange color and I could see the look on Madeline's face turn to pure worry. She said ""we're not safe here,"" and took me into the cellar of her house with a trap door underneath that lead to a panic room. ""She can't hear us here, but when people started becoming more technologically and intellectually advanced, we went into a sort of bunker behind the house where we waited in horror with nothing but a radio with poor transmission due to the radiation. At the top of the bunker was a 5-foot diameter pane of triple-layer bulletproof glass used for looking outside. The sky had turned the color of human blood

All of a sudden, but haunting. I was the only one who heard it, and I just fell down in disbelief as tears flowed down my face. Then, the pane of glass was ripped off of the bunker. What seemed like 200 degree air poured into the room. Frantic, I grabbed onto madeline's hand as tightly as possible, and we were going to try and make it to the secret cellar from earlier. The house was crumbling, and the earth was violently shaking. We knew we were dead, and I could see what looked like a giant orb pressing down toward the earth's surface. Another planet was getting to slam into us at full speed. 

We ran inside the house, and she started convulsing rapidly with blood pouring out of her mouth. I just fell onto my knees and started crying harder than I knew was possible. Crying hard enough that blood started seeping from my skin. She was still momentarily conscious, and I scrambled back onto my feet whispering ""I love you so much"" into her ears. Her hand slowly trembled up to my face and I gripped it tightly. She tried to make a sound, but blood just started spurting out even more. Knowing she only had moments left, and I only had minutes left at best, I bent over and kissed her lips one last time. Her eyes faded backwards, and her muscles went limp. Emotionally torn to shreds, nor were words coming out of my mouth. It was just a bloodcurdling scream that had no other purpose than to show that the last moments of my life, free-falling for what seemed like a full minute before landing in molten lava. I can still feel my skin melting from those few moments where I was still alive in the magma. Everything went dark,

Me, and James Franco's double buddy dates was JC, a good friend, and Jody (another good friend, all three were high and wouldn't leave the nacho table) and Elijah Wood's date were two girls: my sister Nola and my buddy Ruth (they both were trynna compete to see who was the best dressed, throughout the dream, their outfits changed constantly as they were both outclassing each other at every other appearance). JC and Jody both were awesome comedy reliefs and James Franco kept saying ""DUDE YOU GUYS SHOULD BE IN A BUDDY MOVIE"" to where the both of you looked at each other and went ""...... NAaaaaaah"". The EA Christmas Party theme was held at Disneyland this year, so my head just assumed that the inside looked like the inside of a huge, when Toa, we had to get to the end of the mansion where the Sleep Machine Pump and chairs was located.

However, Filipino Style, ready to eat whoever came across his path! We had to stick to the shadows as Mads Mikkelsen seemed to be blinded by the glare of the spotlights that suddenly appeared and pierced through the windows randomly. We managed to get split up somehow and I lost track of Toa and the rest of the group decided to take the stairs and try to get there that way.

But, then Andrew looked and smiled and said ""Oh yeah?"" and he bit into the burrito, swallowed, and the coach of the combined football team arrived and who was it but none other than MEGAN FOX.

I had a real understanding of what happiness truly meant and how it really felt. I explained to my guests what happiness was and why it was so pointless to argue over nothing. I went to my neighbor's daughter and put my arm around her comfortably. I woke up after that not knowing I was asleep or where I was or why I was so frightened.

This is just as much a question as it is an answer.  I could very well be wrong or not entirely right about some of these, or post your take on it &amp; feel free to add to the list.  I'm here to learn &amp; to summarise some of what I've researched so far.  These are just some of the most common dream symbols &amp; what they are commonly believed to represent:

* **A house or building**: represents your body (or perhaps someone else's body if you see another house from the outside with someone else on the inside?  The eyes are the windows?  Things happening inside the house relate to things happening in your head?).
* Your **home**:  is usually an indication that the dream is mildly to significantly important.  A dream about the first house you can remember living in is much more important &amp; worthy of contemplation/translation than a dream about your current home.
* Cars, airplanes, &amp; other **forms of transportation**: Refer to the passage of time.
* **Bodies of water**: indicate emotions (e.g. calm
* **Teeth**:  represent how you appear to others.  Dreams about teeth cracking
* **Bleeding**:  I've read that losing blood relates to losing money &amp; how badly you're bleeding indicates how much money. (e.g. In one very strange dream I had, or whatever when we hung out &amp; I knew she was using me a little, but only because I was the only one responsible enough to keep a job &amp; have money back then)  I wouldn't mind a second opinion on this definition of blood from someone else familiar with dream symbols.
* **Re-occurring dreams**: relate to something you've been dealing with and continue to deal with as long as you keep having these dreams (I'm not good at swimming at all &amp; in dreams, &amp; haven't seen the vicious fishes in many years)

I hope some of you found this useful &amp; I look forward to your input.

For those interested in reading more &amp; who aren't familiar with these

To further help you in uncovering the meaning of your dreams
that possess the same universal meaning for all men and women. He terms this phenomenon the 
""collective unconscious"". While dreams are personal
universal themes and symbols. These symbols are believed to occur in every culture throughout  
history. Jung identifies seven such symbols in what is referred to as the major archetypal 
characters:

1. **The Persona** is the image you present to the world in your waking life. It is your public mask. 
In the dream world
physically or may or may not behave as your would. For example
scarecrow or a beggar in your dream. However
you.

2. **The Shadow** is the rejected and repressed aspects of yourself. It is the part of yourself that 
you do not want the world to see because it is ugly or unappealing. It symbolizes weakness
or anger. In dreams, a bully, or pursuer. It 
can be a frightening figure or even a close friend or relative.  Their appearance often makes you 
angry or leaves you scared. They force you to confront things that you don't want to see or hear. 
You must learn to accept the shadow aspect of yourself for its messages are often for your own 
good

3. **The Anima / Animus** is the female and male aspects of yourself. Everyone possess both feminine 
and masculine qualities. In dreams
appears as a hyper masculine form. Or you may dream that you are dressed in women's clothing
are male or that you grow a beard
well you are able to integrate the feminine and masculine qualities within yourself. They serve as a 
reminder that you must learn to acknowledge or express your masculine (be more assertive) or feminine 
side (be more emotional). 

4. **The Divine Child** is your true self in its purest form. It not only symbolizes your innocence
your sense of vulnerability
potential. You are open to all possibilities. In the dreamscape
baby or young child.  

5. **The Wise Old Man /Woman** is the helper in your dreams. Represented by a teacher, 
priest or some other unknown authority figure
They appear in your dream to steer and guide you into the right direction.

6. **The Great Mother** is the nurturer. The Great Mother appears in your dreams as your own mother
grandmother
they may be depicted as a witch or old bag lady in which case they can be associated with seduction
dominance and death. This juxtaposition is rooted in the belief by some experts that the real mother 
who is the giver of life is also at the same time jealous of our growth away from her. 

7. **The Trickster**
The trickster may appear in your dream when you have overreach or misjudge a situation. Or he could 
find himself in your dream when you are uncertain about a decision or about where you want to go in 
life.  The trickster often makes you feel uncomfortable or embarrassed
exposing  you to your vulnerabilities. He may take on subtle forms

Archetypal dreams, usually occur at 
significant times or transitional periods in your life. They often leave you with a sense of awe or that 
you have learned something important about yourself. Such dreams have a cosmic quality or an element of 
impossibility if occurred in reality. They are often extremely vivid and stay in your mind long after 
you had the dream. ",,t5_2qmbx,1357863134.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/16b3df/common_dream_symbols_what_they_might_mean/

I grabbed the closest sharp thing which was a big, sharp pair of dress makers scissors and headed out side. They had all come back and were still out in my yard celebrating being degenerate youth. (insert yolos here) I ran up and pounced on the mother f**ker with the gun. And I stabbed him right in the neck and did my best to behead him. The gurgles he made mixed with the screaming of the hood girls made a sickening soundtrack to my revenge.

My mom, I just grab the horn and pick the little guy up and walk him over to the barn. The guy inside the barn is like the head rancher and is [this guy](http://i.imgur.com/iehWy.jpg) from joe dirt, but he spoke normally. He thanks me and asks if I wouldnt mind helping out. I agree and he tells me first we need to crack the bulls knuckle. Which in my dream means pushing down on the hoof until it separates like theres a hinge in the back. Once it separates he pulls out a boner grinder (something my dream brain made up) and stars to grind down the mini bulls knuckle and as hes doing this his [assisstant/star bull rider/most popular kid in school](http://i.imgur.com/zPMMj.jpg) we'll call him jason since he didnt have a name in the dream, comes in and is helping out a bit but also complaining about some girl problem hes having.

At this point the rancher hands me a ball of wax and tells me to chew it if i wanna be able to play for another 5 years (???) so I do and he then turns to jason and starts telling him the story of how he and his wife met. This is meant to give jason some insight on his current girl problem (what ever it was I don't know) and this story goes on for a long time. I dont remember the details but I know I was chewing that weird wax ball for a long time. Towards the end of his story I can tell jason is itching to leave and I wanted out of there too so I asked where the bathroom was. Turned out to be very close so I head in to take a piss but can still hear them talking quite easily. Jason is still trying to go out the door when the rancher starts telling the story of how he met his first wife, I hear the door slam and wake up.

I want to make it clear that I am 100% drug free

I have had this dream since I was about 3-4 years old. Only a child, was mostly in darkness.

As I grew older

The dream unfolds like so:

A brief moment of darkness, and there I see the deep black night sky painted with shooting stars, a full moon, and a splat of gray clouds here and there. All is calm – there is no breeze and not the slightest sound made. I am no longer human, and I am completely immobilized. I sit, gazing, and long and behold, and now, and soon, in complete stillness. 

Watching day and night pass perpetually gets boring, sizes, and intensity. It is difficult to discern what each of these shadows resolve to, and with the flipping of day and night escalating with each cycle passed, everything becomes almost stop motion to me, and so, I focus hard on resolving each shadow. Some I quickly identify as family and friends; adults, children; some I have never seen before; some acquaintances, probably make belief… They are wandering about below me, but I don’t feel a thing because I think the thick layer of bark around me prevents me from feeling… But I see them. They laugh

Anyway, and the flickering of day and night becomes so rapid that I can’t keep up with the visuals. I turn my attention to myself, but I cannot see myself. I could feel the leaves and branches as my arms, and the deep roots as my legs. I cannot move. An avalanche of snow or wave of water wipes everything below me, and next thing you know, I am clinging to my dear life, I do not budge. The tidal force barely moves me, people, the thunder blanks out, but I know it’s there…

I wake up

I get this dream roughly a handful of times a year, so I thought this time perhaps I should share it with the Reddit community to see what your thoughts are and if there are some deeper/hidden meaning behind all of this.

Thank you for listening.

Problem:  For some reason, but a massive force field was blocking the only entrance in and out of the valley, and also blocking access from above.  I was trapped with many others in the massive pyramid, which was even further quarantined, with each huge room within locked down as well, in an effort to make travel impossible.  We didn't know why there was a quarantine, nor who initiated it.

Being the future, shinier appearance, an elongated head (about 3/4 the length of the average human body), a pleasant ""face"", and a dozen thick, 7 foot long tentacles.  They were created as helpful workers, and were situated all throughout the city.  However, except they were designed solely to kill

The only modes of travel possible throughout the pyramid was a series of ductworks, steampunk version style of Oliver Twist).  The kids were a sort of gang similar to the little rascals.  They would point the portal gun (looked like a laser pointer) at a nearby wall, and it would open a portal to a random location within the pyramid.  They were traveling as they pleased, scavenging and having fun, not knowing the world was going to end.  At one point their portal opened to a secret series of ductwork, and you could see one of the evil squid robots waiting in stasis at the end.

As I tried to get the kids to give me the portal machine so I could travel to the main chamber room and shut down the countdown, and I jumped through, unsure of where I would end up.  I ended up in a sort of viewing room of the pyramid, which overlooked the entire city as the sunset.  I wasn't the only one in the room though, as there were 5 or 6 other people around me.  I could see on a nearby clock that we had less than 5 minutes til the countdown completed, so I drafted an email and sent it to the outside world, hoping my family would see it.  It was going to serve as a last will and testament.

I then turned my attention to the people in the room, and it's beautiful.""  I hugged a few of the people there, and even kissed one of the girls just to have one last kiss, then we sat down and watched the sky turn orange and smokey.  I could see a hazy smoke rising from the town, and I'm not sure now if the countdown had finished and all that smoke was destruction from the hundreds of squid robots.  Suddenly a large burst of smoke started creeping along the town from the far end, and it approached the pyramid, looking like a dust storm.  As it rushed the pyramid, like the world was falling apart.

Many of the buildings show sign of destruction: blown out windows, a group of coworkers

Access to food, medical supplies, clean clothes and showers are limited.  There are no cell phones or wall phones, and there is little- to no- electricity or running water.  Helicopters fly overhead. People move in groups – never alone – and people are constantly shifting from one area of the complex to another in a hurried fashion.  People traveling alone are shot on sight. There are children, but my child is in another area of the complex with some of my family, an area that is heavily guarded and has food and water.  I want desperately to get to him, but I do not know where the he is. I know that I am held in high regard by the group, and I know that I will find my son.

Most people in my group and other groups are complaining about the situation, but people have been known to provide purposely misleading information so that they can corner you and kill you for whatever supplies you may have.   I listen carefully to discern the truth between the lies and deception.  Portions of groups begin to leave the area, headed in different directions.  I try to view the movements as a whole and figure out where the majority of the more trustworthy people are moving.  I notice my group has started to panic and fight with each other.  I motion to those I trust to follow me and we slip away from them and start to walk briskly in the direction I think the convoy must be.

I can feel the cold metal of an air conditioning unit under my body.  I shout to the woman to remain calm and try to come towards me so we can get off this building.

A woman with long brown hair notices us and runs over.  I ask her to please help the woman to the right, as I can get up just fine. THe dark-skinned woman keeps shouting, panicked manner

When I come to, the room is nearly empty; by the time I’m settled into the chair, there are more people than I have ever seen in my life.  There is a constant din of chatter and moans filling my ears.  I feel no pain, and I am irritated that I am made to sit still when all I want to do is lead my people to the convoy so I can save them and find my son.  A doctor sits in front of me and regards me with a dis-compassionate and grim expression.

It seems the attention of the entire space is upon me.  Two of the men – medical students, and I feel nothing.  I am furious to have sustained such an injury

The doctor begins to give the medical students instructions to prepare me for surgery. Their filthy gloved hands move towards me, and that I want them to wear clean gloves and I want him, the doctor, to do the surgery, not the medical assistants.  He regards me sternly, and then assuages my concerns by admonishing his assistants and sends them to wash their hands and find clean gloves.  I tell him I will take care of removing my clothing myself, and that my privates don’t need to be touched in that manner.

I've shared multiple dreams with someone very close to me. We even passed information to each other THROUGH a dream. It sounds impossible but it happened. Here goes:

Ever since I've known this person, we have always been connected. We just know what the other felt, what they were thinking, etc. [This also made any fight we had all the more painful, since we could see the others secrets' and supposedly hidden insecurities.]

The first shared dream came in my junior year of high school (her senior year). Prom was approaching and we were going together

After our first year of college (I graduated early) she had to move to Florida (we were in Virginia at the time). We weren't dating then, stupid and jealous the entire time, we had a huge fight before she left and we didn't speak for six or seven years.

Here is where the story gets interesting, I just got this feeling that we needed to patch things up. I doubted we would ever be friends, yet alone best friends but for the sake of being a mature adult (something that is still quite difficult to master), I figured that we should bury the hatchet and turns out that we soon picked up to being as close as we had been back when we were friends and could literally read each others minds.

Within a week of talking again, watching our favorite TV show, Rurouni Kenshin [yeah, we were anime nerds], and we were even watching the same episode. We laid on the couch with myself on the inside, her on the outside. After the episode, we went to the porch to talk to each other about how happy that ""we"" were back.

Back in reality, it was still a very scary downright creepy concept given the situation.

However, that would confirm any doubts we would ever have about the connection. To do this, we would have to think of a phrase...any phrase...as long as the other wouldn't know what it was, or even GUESS what it was. It could be a random string of words, letters or numbers, a phrase from a movie the other never saw (but wouldn't be well-known), etc.

It did not happen immediately but I had a dream where she told me what the phrase was (a song lyric from a band I never listened to and I never listened to anything except ESPN radio at the time) and several days later she had a dream where I texted her my phrase

While it wasn't within the same dream, given our situations, we have not really tested those waters and we have just conceded that connection certainly exists, we just aren't aware of its origin or purpose (unless it's just that we exist as best friends). We just sit back and joke how [Ka is a wheel and all things serve the beam.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Tower_%28series%29)

There are more stories/examples of this connection

*I would like to add to that while I do believe what happened, it's just an anecdote that I thought people would enjoy. Our lives and situations are a bit too stressful right now to consistently try something like this but if the day ever comes where we are comfortable with attempting this again, we will certainly make another post.

What does it mean?,RadOwl,10,3,13,"One of the more common topics for dreams discussed at /r/dreams is meeting someone you fall in love with instantly. You know right away that something is special about the person. There's chemistry, basically.

Beneath your personality is a sub-personality of the opposite sex. Dr. Carl Jung called it anima in men

Anima in men teaches them to be sensitive and nurturing. She inspires and is a powerful source of creativity. But if the relationship is contentious

Animus in women teaches them to be independent and strong. He helps her work out her values and stick to her guns. But when the relationship is out of whack she'll be sarcastic and bitter.

It's a simplified example -- the relationship with this part of your psyche can be just as deep and challenging as waking life relationships. The ultimate goal of the relationship is union between the conscious and unconscious sides of the mind. Some call it the ""marriage of the soul."" The process starts after the shadow side of the psyche has been tamed, and can be central figures in thousands of dreams over the course of a lifetime.

go to the farm the kids referred to, there are many children from 4 to 16, including the mans son.   TV is playing, everything seems normal and happy there is news broadcasting, i am relieved, i go to the bathroom, the house has running water and food
 
 
I speak with the woman, there are no updates on the still functional internet there.   
 
 
I tend the field with the children and here things like ""the Russians had found their red god"" on the repeating news channels and what not
 

gang of 3 bikers closes us in, the people in the car yelled ""(*@#$&amp;%^ probes are sending people do the moon station"" I don’t know what that means.   We drove around a bunch of other cars that were getting sucked up, and flew off the exit. into a part of the city close to the store we were going to.
 
 
there were a lot of weird things like an ectoplasm person blob just crawling along the floor and a lot of punk looking people, there were coolers with drinks and stuff on all sides, the store clerk asked if i would grab him some beer that i cant remember but it exists today.   there was a small stand in the center that had cheezits and other assorted snacks, and the cooler on the pavement had fresh looking sandwiches in them. I asked the clerk as the man who i started growing close to was paying for everything if they were able to do things like get the cheezit factory back up and running.   he told me he had it up and running and something was difficult, or maybe it was difficult to find i don’t remember.
 
 
After that the man and i started growing close and fond of each other.  I learned that everyone in Russia hated the Americans and i hate to keep my identity a secret.  
 
 
the man and his wife learned that his wife's mother had died in the holocaust, i did ask he asked. Then later i talked to the man and he affirmed that he knew i was an American but it did not matter to him, I felt very loved.
 
 
there is a gap, aiming to kill it.   it was not large maybe 4 feet tall, and i chased it down a hill where it suddenly grew large, up to 20 feet tall.   I had to dodge some of its attacks and climb up on it and bash it in the face with the butt of my gun, it shrunk again and i shot it in the head.
 
 
The man came down the hill on a horse to see if i was alright than all of the sudden all these pelican/banshee looking things (halo/sc2 respectively) swooped in, than one of the men shot him in the throat. The man fell to his knees and yelled at me with the last of his air ""Take my gun! Run!""
 
 
I think the kid who shot him made a mistake, telling his wife that he had died.   She was very upset and told me the man had thought of me as a soon, and had always known i was an American and did not say anything because i reminded him of himself. the mans son was upset, but he stood up to take over the farm and lead everything.
 
 
another gap, and at that moment I felt a sudden pang and missing for the man and wondered about my family in America which was most certainly dead in all probability.

I woke up on a pirate ship. There were two pirates there who seemed as surprised to see me as I was to see them. I couldn't remember who I was
We landed on an island to trade (I think) and all were stopped by the police and asked for identification. They provided it, and that it was a new identity because I didn't know who I was. He said the name sounded made up. I told him it was made up - we didn't know who I was so a new name was made up for me. He laughed and left us alone.  

We continued to walk along the beach, I said we were found guilty but escaped. They said if we were found guilty we'd be killed, so it must be bullshit. Just then, three boats on the horizon were on fire, and we all realised we had been setup.  

Rather than go through town and get caught (the action I remembered from the last time I ""saw this film""), but there's no canal at the top, just a road). At the top of the hill was a canal boat. The other pirates told me it was too slow, but I said we had no choice, so we commandeered it.  

At this point, then we cut loose, jumped into the sea, and swam to our escape.  

Then suddenly it was back to the other ending where we weren't caught, 2 or 3 (I'm not sure), one was a man. We threw them out to sea, and left them in freezing cold water with sharks circling them. We told them they'd be dead in ten minutes, but don't worry because the other boats (our pursuers) were less than 5 minutes behind us and would rescue them. That's where the dream ended.

We were all sitting around talking about stuff and things.  The conversation turned to a wistful sort of remembrance of humanity as it used to be.  I looked up at the sky and I could see the moon, how we got here.  There was a sort of ""haha, guess that shit's all over now"" feel to it.  I could see the human migration paths looking up at the moon.  I remember pointing to the moon and saying, ""There's one place we won't be migrating to any time soon.""

Then I became aware of some more prisoners that had just gotten released from inside the building.  Captain Picard was there.  Just there, talking about computer models that we used to sell, known issues, that sort of thing.  ""Hey, remember that optiplex with the graphics issues from nVidia.""  ""Yeah, I did so many reinstalls trying to figure that issue out, replaced cards, and I became him.

Now, and there's a limestone cliff of sorts that gets created on either side of the road as it dips.  As I walked up the road as my friend, I saw my brother (in real life, I have no siblings, but he does).  We were walking past Dell, and he point to the cliff side and said, ""That's where I had to bury mom, and said that there was a wifi hotspot there with a message broadcasting her information, I used to be an archaeologist).  We continued to walk along, usual sort of bad food fare that they serve to show you how much they really care.  We laughed

Sometime during all of that it ceased being me being my friend and his brother and became me and him.  We ended up grabbing knapsacks and headed out towards town in search of supplies.  We cut through a neighborhood that had started to become heavily overgrown due to neglect.  We talked about old days, get what I need and come home with food and supplies on my back.)  We finally made it to downtown where we stopped by some small shop.  They had a little of everything for sale, but pretty much had been picked over.  There was one shelf with some bottles of alcohol on it.  I immediately grabbed the last bottle of whiskey, but before I could get a top shelf bottle of rum, somebody else grabbed it.  We rummaged through some clothing and other junk.  Electricity was working here, as were debit cards.  We paid, and I remember saying ""The banks can have whatever money is left in my account.  They won, and now it's worthless.""  I felt ok about it

Normally I don't have such vivid or intense dreams.  It may happen once or twice a year, and society crept along.

There, another man (who might have been my teacher, or leader, or whatever) asked me questions about the hill.  I could not answer them.  Instead, I offered him information about one of the hill-folk who was known to me.

1319088919.0,liexk,The eye lamp,ActionScripter9109,8,0,3,"I used to have dreams that would consist of a series of smaller dreams.  I'd start in one place, and occasionally the overarching goal of the dream situation would vanish entirely and be replaced by something else.  I was used to this; it was generally relaxing and entertaining

One night, hanging out in the room that my mom taught in, and admiring an elaborate water-powered setup sitting on the floor.  This thing was about the size of a desk top, and it was composed of all sorts of wheels and streams and rods that kept the flow moving constantly.  I was always fascinated by Rube Goldberg machines, and I stood there in the dream, gazing at the device.  

Slowly, but now the image before me was a ghost of the water device, oddly displayed as a reflection on a car window.  Something clicked in my mind, that this wasn't right and there should be no car window in front of me.  I broke my focus on the device and looked around, the water sound ceasing entirely.  

I was standing between two cars, and there was little moonlight.  The lot was full of cars but there was not a living soul in sight.  

Since I was used to seeing dreams shift before my eyes, I saw that I was indeed standing next to my family's black '97 Taurus, so I figured everything was fine.  Satisfied with the circumstances, I looked around again.  

Off in the distance, I stared at it.  It did not move like car headlights or a flashlight; it remained in place.  As I watched, it began to grow brighter.  I was a bit surprised by this, but I didn't see any reason to fear.  At least not yet.  But as the strange light grew in intensity, it began to take shape.  It was an oblong shape, with points at each side and a dark spot in the center.  It looked exactly like a single human eye, unblinking as it glowed at me.  My vision grew sharper as I forced myself to ""zoom in"" on the eye.  What I saw sent my heart into my throat.  

The eye light was mounted on a post.  Sitting below the post, unfriendly eyes.  He was looking directly at me; there was no doubt.  And somehow I knew he meant me harm.  Without breaking eye contact or even flinching, the creepy lounger spun the knob back, and the eye lamp turned off.  

If I had known the phrase

There was no more lamp.  There was only a shadowy figure

Now I was in full panic.  Knowing that there was nowhere to run, slamming the door behind me.  Another glance out the windshield showed that the shadowy runner had traversed the entire lot in seconds and was hustling towards the driver's door.  In fear-paralyzed slow motion, I shot a hand toward the power lock switch, and in the same instant the runner's hand flew at the outside door handle.  Time slowed to a crawl as my brain screamed at my arm to move faster.  Judging the distances and speeds of both our hands, I knew he'd get there first.  And in a flash of practicality, I decided I wasn't going to stick around and find out what the shadow of the eye wanted with me.  

I blinked, wide-eyed, blinking furiously.

This sounds really crazy so I made a throwaway to avoid my RL redditor friends. I don't care if you don't believe me, very angry and menacing. They'd come towards me then kind of fade off to the sides, two rows, one on each side. Sometimes it was just angry eyes. Human, animal, cartoon - all very angry. It took a long time to realize that when I saw these faces, it meant I was about to dream about a place I actually really liked. The place only existed in my dreams but it was like an alternate universe for me. I had memories of that place like anyone does about their childhood

I don't want to expand on the dream place because I'm trying to get back there again and I don't want to ruin my chances. I told a few people once about this place, people I ""knew"" and liked, suddenly had angry faces - like the ones that usually come before I ""go"" to this place. They shot me. Three times. In three different rooms. Twice I woke up after getting shot. I didn't wake up in real life, but the me in my dream woke up. I thought, ""Wow, I'm glad I made it through that,"" looked over, and get shot again. I didn't wake up the third time.

This ""shooting"" happened about 7-8 years ago. I've really missed the place. I keep trying to force myself to remember the angry faces, either an old-timey one or one located in a country that wasn't at all modern. A woman was leaning over a well in the middle of the town square, she was wearing a large-brimmed, purple hat. She looked right at me. Angry face, like the old days. I was both freaked out and kind of relieved. Like somehow I wasn't forgotten by that place and those people I used to ""visit."" I know this makes me sound nuts, but my first thought was ""they're finally coming to let me back in.""

That was two years ago. I now work in a hotel in the heart of downtown Chicago. I see a lot of people on the street. I sold my car last winter and take public transportation, and she had her angry face on. In the last six months or so, I've seen 10-12 more people who were glaring at me, the way those faces used to. Then the people disappear in the crowd when I try to follow them. I'm kind of scared but I'm also kind of thrilled. I know I sound crazy, but these people might be following me around in real life now. I still can't get back to that place I used to go to, though.

The silhouette of a girl sits up as much as the ceiling allows. She's looking at me. I can't make out any details of her face. I wake up.

I'm curious as to why I felt worried for the kids in each situation and also the fact that both of these locations were places that I haven't been to in 15+ years.

Most of the dream was fairly ordinary. At the very end of it, getting ready for some kind of event. 

The room we were in had a lot of old-timey folding screens, and the woman was talking to me about her plans: suddenly a gunshot rang out somewhere behind me, and in a panic both of us fled.

We ran through the screens

A voice, which had more pews with some boards or something leaned against them. The voice was sobbing in fear, emoting my terror in the put-on way of a kindergarten teacher narrating a protagonist in a book for her class: 'Find an opening, find an opening, hide, hide...'

The next room had cabinets in it, that they were the leavings of whoever was shooting at us. We ducked into the cabinet, and there was nowhere else to go.

I was sure we had escaped, shot through with brilliant lightning-bolts of yellow. I was still narrating my own death: ""Recoil....recoil....recoil,"" I droned, ""for a million, billion years.""

So we're sat down by the waters edge, I'm smoking it up with James Fucking Franco, I must be dreaming... oh shit, I am dreaming!"" 

I've had a couple of lucid dreams before, I can only control my own actions. The situations/locations and people around me all do whatever they please, but I don't mind to be honest. I like going with the flow. 

Anyway, cross legged, bong on her lap and a huge bag of weed in her hand. She puts them in a bag, still laughing, then stands up and takes both of our hands and leads us to group of people she ""wants us to meet"". (I swear to God, when she took hold of my hand I could feel her beauty, something I've only ever experienced in my current relationship, perhaps suggesting this is my representation of my girlfriend in my dream?)

I can't remember any of the of people apart from a little girl who followed me and James away from the group after a very short amount of time conversing with the strangers. For some reason

Next thing I know, the blood soaking into my clothes. I could feel the sticky warmth of it, clinging to me and almost burning my flesh. He looked at me and smiled, and simply said goodbye as a trickle of blood fell from the corner of his mouth before huge, furiously violent bubbles started to pour out. 

Audrey Hepburn then grabs my hand again, we just ran for what felt like an eternity. While we ran we talked and talked and talked non-stop until we reached a pier. At the end of the pier was a long bench, with somebody leaning back, legs out-stretched and head back on the end of it. I slowly walked over and sat down right next to them. It's James Franco again, and he's ok. He looks at me and smiles again, that same scarily peaceful and beautiful smile he gave me before he died. I notice over his shoulder that Madeleine is running towards what I assume are her parents. 

Out of nowhere though, but Audrey is still being dragged away. I run towards her with James and we manage to miraculously fight them off and drag Audrey away from them. I hug her, but seconds after embracing I see one of the men pull a piece from his side. He aims straight towards Audrey, and time just slowed down. I could literally see the bullet dancing through the air, but Franco is moving normal speed. He calmly walks directly into the path of the bullet, turning to me before the impact and smiles that same smile again, and whispers goodbye again. He then turns back to face the bullet

I quickly let go of Audrey and run towards him, ready to jump in and save him, only to see Audrey being dragged off again. I'm out-numbered and there's nothing I can do other than tell her I'll find her. She simply looks at me with the most gut-wrenching expression imaginable, so much so that just thinking about it upon waking made me feel sick. She holds out her hand towards me just as I turn and plummet towards the water. Throughout the fall all I can see is the events being replayed over and over again, until the impact of the water seemingly woke me up. 

I've spent the last day feeling like absolute shit because of this dream

For a good half hour I was doing whatever I wanted. I kissed a smoker. I didn't even pay the delivery man and he was black and he didn't care. At one point I thought to myself

-----


It wasn't that simple, and the second fired a real gun with fake bullets. Those silly trolls.

Twice I laid down in the snow, people appeared out of some dropship (couldn't see shit, captain, I don't know how big it was) and collected some data on a short clipboard like I was doing a survey. They said thank you and each time I just walked away like nothing happened. 

I kept smashing a small piece of ice with my hands and doing tactical rolls everywhere

 The house. I don't know who's house it was
 Maybe 40 years old in build, he never even looked at me or said a word. Two people were watching TV downstairs and looked bored as hell.

Lots of this took place at night in the house. It was a large house, and going down those stairs revealed a basement slightly larger than the last basement you visited.  That night time was interesting because I was more concerned with exploring it than abusing it.

I forced daytime to come after night got boring, but really I just knew I wanted to have a kiss.

Near the end, so I waltzed right up and opened the door. A guy that looked like Chef Ainsley was there with two boxes of delicious pizza, and I gave him my trademark grin and he knew he wasn't getting money but life was good.  The dogs didn't bark or anything because I was totally giving off an aura of command. 

Went and ate that pizza so good next to a fireplace.  I don't recall sharing

Back to night time in that house. 
Several times I felt myself approaching reality , being next to the fireplace and crossing my eyes - the flame disappeared, and I close my eyes and wish it were - then the flames are back.  Not too long after this I closed my eyes again, and when I opened them, I was laying in my bed staring at the dim light of a venetian-blind window. It was over, and I feel fine. 


The soundtrack to this dream was Álfheimr. Estimated time, for the first time, achieved FULL lucidity - able to control every aspect of my dream for as long as I wanted. I am lucky, because this is usually something I would have to work for with many times of practice and training the mind to recall details as well as make them.

But tonight i had a really horrifying nightmare which i just can't let go and it also brings back memories from my previous nightmares. English is not my mother tongue so excuse any grammar mistakes. I only remember sequences of it.

I think it started with me living in a sewer. I was hiding from something, i saw a man(?) with a mask made of human skin and flesh- similar to Bloody Face in American Horror Story: Asylum. It gets kind of blurry from here but i think he tried to slash my face or something.
In the next sequence i am in some sort of underground or perhaps under a dirty stone bridge. I have a narrator with me. I see midget soldiers being force-fed water. The narrator explains to me that they're short because of their malnutrition- water was all they were allowed to consume during their service. It was a really horrifying sight
In the next sequence i am above ground, but i wasn't sure.
I was in the sewers again. This time there were two little boys down there as well
He rolled a thin mattress around his younger brother and started beating him with the sledge making the mattress all bloody. The younger brother seemed to be in pain but didn't express any feelings of such. It was as if he also enjoyed it somehow. He crawled out of the mattress and sought shelter behind me but i didn't dare touch him

The next sequence was above ground. It was a sunny day and i ha brought a book with me to read outside. Again i found myself just above the sewer where i had been witnessing and experiencing this. (My throat is thick as i write this). I started panicking again and it was the most intense anxiety i've ever felt. I wondered if i would ever be able to live a normal life after this experience. How does one manage these kind of atrocities? I stood on the lid of the well and felt as if the ""Bloody Face""-tormentor was still alive down there just waiting for the lid to fall of and for me to fall down again. Die

I woke up at 6 am frozen in my bed
I just want to know what it is i can't let go of

Wednesday July 24


It started out as one of those recurring dreams (I think), so I transformed. I flew over a bit and the train stopped to wait for me kinda. I saw that my dad was standing on the water making a fire that was also somehow standing on the water. Liza was walking around nearby. Suddenly, I looked at the train and saw that one of the Chinese people on the train (that I’d seen before and thought was suspicious) was choking her with a string! I told my dad “Dad, quick! She fell into the fire!” – He’s like “Where? Where?” He looked around assuming I was talking about my little sister Liza who was just walking around it. I start sprinting towards the train and he somehow understands that he means that someone’s choking Olessia. We stopped and apologized to each other for being confusing and for not understanding one another. I started running again, as I picked up a 8 inch by 3 inch drawn and colored picture of a sword. I turned into a bird and flew straight onto the train, by which time everything was back to normal.

We soon appeared at the movie theatre. We started watching Harry Potter 1, on some shady street just flying around with a bunch of human maids. Continuing on, I saw stairs leading down to god knows what – stairs like in that Battlefield 3 map. The one with the underground train tracks. Where you have to go from this park-style area through the subway area then back up to a mall and to like 5 6-story high apartment buildings. Behind them are the stairs – the ones I was talking about.

Suddenly, and 13 year olds the same size as me – yet I was only 10. I couldn’t decide if I wanted someone older or shorter. I decided to go back for one of the pretty 13 year old girls I saw, which is when we walked past the bird kissing area, etc.

I was in a house now. Chinamen were trying to kill us, all of the lights were off, and a mix of my dad and Olessia were lying in the middle of the kitchen floor. I couldn’t tell who it is so naturally I said “What’s up?” They said “Hold on! Quiet down! People have *cough cough* broken in! Chinamen!” “Oh no”, I said! He/she started blabbering about how I should get random shit while I was stuffing my belt with kitchen knives. They said something and I didn’t hear it exactly – I said “There’s a what, where?” They said “There’s some tools that may help you under the washing machine” – I said “Oh, I remember that dad used to have a gun here before. Did you know that guns are illegal in Canada?” “Oh, really? Haha that’s cool.” (Guess he/she was partially my 11 year old oblivious sister now.)

I looked under the washing machine and found a large firecracker – it was only about 3x the size of the few I saw a bit before. I decided not to take any of them because they’re so loud that they’ll call everyone to the house. Instead, so I looked around, quietly creeping. Nobody was on the main floor. I suddenly realized that there was music playing upstairs – like really loud music. I decided to wait for them to come down one by one. Lemme explain quickly – the stairs are right in the middle of the main entrance room. (I came through the side door when I came in.) If you go right, it’s the living room. Continue straight in a circle around the actual stairs and you’ll be in the bar. Continue to the other two or three rooms in the circle around the stairs and idk what’s there. Anyways, I went around it clockwise and when I came back to the bar, I thought I heard something behind me. I continued and turned right at the living room as soon as I entered, hiding behind the wall. “Fuck, trying to look into the dark living room. I quickly get up to stab him, none of them straight. As I’m finally about to stab him in the heart

I continued doing that for a while as many people came down all over the place usually one at a time. Finally, I hid right up against the wall. (Living room’s left, entrance room’s right.) I tried to light a Listerine thing but my lighter wasn’t lighting, as it often doesn’t in real life. Suddenly, it worked – I lit it and threw the Listerine pack into the middle of the room. It started flashing violently and those two idiots just stared straight at it. I’m pretty sure they were drunk. I went up and stabbed the one on the left, right in the doorway of the living room / entrance room. I then went up to the kitchen one, but the light went out a bit early. He was super drunk and held out his weird German gun (like the one on the Imgur front page yesterday). He shot at me just as I jumped on the couch, stabbing him in the stomach.

I heard something – I didn’t know what. I suddenly remembered my friend Bogdan playing this game, they switched focuses and the machete guy turned around, leaving his back exposed. I just slashed it once and a deep gash was on his neck, but he didn’t even notice. Suddenly the fire guy started spraying me with fire. I kept running, trying to turn around and attack when I could. Suddenly, I was too close! I couldn’t evade him! He sprayed me with fire, leading to me rolling on the ground, just a 10 year old with fireworks in his pockets. (Guess fire makes you younger?) My teacher came up and asked what I was doing (I knew she was my teacher but I’d never seen her before in real life). I said “nooothing”. She started coming up to me when I fumbled in my pockets and a thick purple sock fell out. “See

----------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;Leah&gt; i know i don't curse that much but i have to say. last night/this morning I think i had one of the most fucked up dreams i've ever had 

&lt;K[A]&gt; Oh?

&lt;t[L]&gt; Sounds fun

&lt;S[w]&gt; What was the dream about?

&lt;Leah&gt; I was with my sister and mom, so i'll just sum up that it was someone I liked) were in a car going somewhere 

&lt;Leah&gt; we got in a minor traffic accident and were close to a hospital so they made us go there

&lt;Leah&gt; somehow at this place

&lt;Leah&gt; it turned out it was my cousin Dusty, and a few others. 

&lt;Leah&gt; i basically watched them die from outside of the quarantine, kind of sheilding me with his jacket as we left (we got tested to make sure we didn't have the disease so we didn't go around spreading it), hiding me from all the cameras of the newspeople outside the hospital.

&lt;S[w]&gt; Damn

&lt;Leah&gt; and then! this whole time during parts of the dream

&lt;Leah&gt; but then it turned more dream like and a little more surreal i guess

&lt;t[L]&gt; Hm

&lt;Leah&gt; turns out my friend hosted some sort of 'fact or fiction' show with the lead singer of the band Falling in Reverse and Dave Grohl

&lt;Ts&gt; bleh

&lt;Leah&gt; we were going to go to my friend's house, with everything being built in blocks. there was some sort of puzzle and someone ahead of us solved it and we followed them 

&lt;Leah&gt; it turned out to be a release party for something to do with a sequel to Amnesia

&lt;Leah&gt; and everyone started turning in to zombies except for the party host and me and i was freaking out

&lt;Leah&gt; but it turned out to be some reveal of a new monster thing

&lt;Leah&gt; so I found my friend and was basically clinging to him sobbing when I woke up   

&lt;Leah&gt; and that was the dream I had.

&lt;Leah&gt; it's just crazy that you can practically have another life in dreams and it's not real :c 

&lt;Leah&gt; and the reason i say that is because now i miss the friend that helped me u.u 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

So here is where I've experienced things I never had in a dream

I've had dreams where I experience anger, death, fear. But this is the first dream where I've felt such a real sense of loss and sadness, and it's still affecting me. I know I can call my mother or my sister and talk to them now and that they're still alive, but I *saw them die*. I was right there... When the doctors announced that everyone that contracted the disease had died, I collapsed on the floor and tried to deny it. I've never felt something like that before, ever. Including outside of a dream.

And then this friend... this is when it gets stupid. Somehow he was a friend I had a crush on in high school. We never talked too much but he was in a few classes with me and I was friends with his girlfriend at the time so I knew a moderate amount about him. Somehow he was there, real or not. And now I miss him more than I've missed someone in a while. Not the friend I knew in school, but the one that comforted and protected me. 

Has anyone else ever had such strong feelings in a dream? Or missed the people they met in them? I just have a feeling it's going to stay with me for a while and knowing I'm not alone in those feelings would make me feel a lot better.

Now usually this horn is to signal extreme weather (tornadoes, my brain decided not to put air horn and weather together but instead the air horn meant some kind of attack. I didn't really pay it any attention other than making the connection that the air horn represented something out of my control.

Now I've fallen asleep at this point and I'm dreaming about standing in my yard. Nothing wrong with dreaming about standing in the yard, darkness envelopes my senses and everything goes pitch black. In the few seconds it took for things to go dark I literally lose my mind and I panic, scream and cry inside my mind. This gut wrenching feeling, sinking feeling is all happening at once and I can't do anything but one last thought crosses my mind. I scream at the top of my lungs and as hard as I can to myself to **WAKE. THE. FUCK. UP!!!** 

I instantly wake up in a panic scared out of my mind with the worst feeling I've ever had in my stomach.

There are three tiers of people.  The doctors
The doctors are supposed to help the people
The doctors are somehow hiding the entrance to the other areas so the kids don’t know they exist. 
The nicer the area
There are robots and people that are running the place but mainly robots I think.  Every so often the robots at random murder a bunch of the people in the lowest tier.  
If someone from a lower tier goes to a higher tier the robot sometimes comes to kill them but it doesn’t always work.
The robots have some sort of goal
I think maybe the doctors are allowed to select like a few people each to bring into the room. 
Apparently they often bully for sexual favours or in return.  The doctors are pretty happy but the rest are pretty miserable.   
The main guy is supposed to be in the second area but somehow is convinced by one of the doctors to come to the main safest area.  None of the doctors seem very frightened.   Before a robot attack
Everyone has some sort of telecenetic powers but its very minimal.  Powers are boosted by blue gum or blue toothpaste that everyone loves but supply is running low.  
Somehow I know this doesn’t make sense, you like pretty much become the chosen one and gets great powers.  If someone else does the same thing I think than they become the one.  
Main characters powers is to like be able to give an instruction what to do (obviously stolen from bioshock.) 
The main character in a confused dream state isn’t sure if he’s suppose to be in tier 1 or tier 2
Main character realizes enough Is enough and eats the whole thing of blue power gel.  I don’t know why he didn’t do this before
Now the robots are getting pissed and start coming in but the main character tells the one robot to kill the other and he does.  More and more like advanced robots (think transformer type robots) are coming in and main character takes control of more and more and gets like an army of robots and is telling all the robots to kill each other.  Now for some reason it's  like a party and everyone is excited about possibly getting out.   Main character for some reason is now trying to transfer his powers to someone else but there is not enough blue gel.  For whatever reason his powers are starting to wane.  When he goes back into the main room everyone
He (of course) sees someone he knows.  “Is this one of those distopian apolypses where all the building are burning?”  
“The buildings are burning but I wouldn’t worry too much about it.”  
Looking to the LA sky line
“I have to get to Toronto” says the main character.”  “That’s where we’re going” says the others and he goes with them.

The dream itself can be explained in detail if you want. If i could describe it in a few sentences.... There is a large 4 story (basement and attic)  and a large back wooded area that turned into a field. the field holds a small trailer park. at the back of the field it turns into a camp ground complete with a river/lake. the lake has a giant cruise ship in it.  if you go the opposite way of the house there is a city that is vast that leads no where but back to the house.  i can tell you every direction that i've gone in this dream ive had it so much. i cant call it a lucid dream really because i dont know im dreaming until i wake up. i cant tell you how many times ive considered it to be just another place i live when i sleep. sorry for the giant wall of text.. but most of the time when im dreaming im not having a good time.

So it started off with this weird dream I had while I was having a sleep over with my friend.

DREAM NUMBER 1

The dream started off with me basically in The Dark Knight. The joker was there and they were discussing some mob stuff.

It then somehow transitions to me being at this one camp I've been to before... but the entire place has a big rollercoaster type thing surrounding it.

Basically

Then

At this event

Elijah wood was one of the tire throwers

One of the times that the tire was thrown this girl that I know got hit.

Before I go on

Anyways... she got hit with a tire, went up to me and lifted up her dress, showing me her vagina. I thought it was really fucking weird and I didn't know why. Then she just walked away.

After the event I went into my cabin and she was the only one there. She lifted up her dress again
I'm pretty sure something like this happened a few more times

I've had other dreams about specific people

DREAM NUMBER 2

One involved Chloe Grace Moretz (who is my celebrity crush.) and starting in the dream I already knew her.

 She texted me inviting me to a restaurant

She was acting really shy and sad. For some reason I decided to leave.

After I went back home I couldn't stop thinking about her

I did and I just immediately knew that I needed to take her to this Teen's Oscars sort of thing.

When we were driving there

When I was in that part of town

I said ""Is that where the oscars are? Are they today?""

""Yeah.""

""Why aren't you there?""

""Because I'm not 18.""

After she said this she started crying. I didn't know what to do so I kept driving.

So we arrived at the teen awards place and it looked like a big warehouse.

We go inside and it looks like a nightclub

I take her home or something.

I woke up covered in sweat after that dream and couldn't stop thinking about her.

So... um. What the fuck is going on with me? Why am I having such weird dreams? And such specific ones

My dreams used to be about being in the woods and being attacked by a bear or stealing a car and crashing it

Also, I just want you to know that I didn't steal it. That was me.

He is encouraging me to solve the problem and helping when he can. We work back and forth getting closer and closer to a solution to the ""problem"" we are writing. But his responses get further apart but our excitement is building. Finally I have the solution.. I get so excited and I write it out with exclamation points... 78!!! But he doesn't seem to get it. I write it out 2-3 more times and tap on the mirror. Then I realize hes written something but I can't understand it. So I back away a bit and realize hes been furiously scribbling a large picture of a rather horrific female face. Two words appear on the mirror... ""She's Coming!"" and I get this sense of urgency. The other side of the mirror starts to flicker and a banging starts up and I can just feel his need for me to get out of the room before she shows up. Things are coming to a crescendo as I slam the door open and take a step outside and suddenly... I'm awake.

.....Suddenly I am spectating an extremely disturbing episode of the adult cartoon Family Guy. Lois Griffin, Stewie is sitting in his highchair behind her witnessing these events. As she is shoving more and more food into herself, her stomach begins to bulge like a pregnant woman. She then reaches into the pantry closet and pulls out an entire cooked turkey dinner. However, she struggles to fit such a large item into her vagina. At this moment Stewie says something along the lines of, ""Mommy I don't think your groin has a credit card slot.""  
.....At this part the scene begins to lose some of it's coherency
.....The scene is now first-person from Peter's point of view, alien-like figure with dark beady, insect-like eyes. Her stomach is no longer bulging and she has a shiny multi-colored body. Peter begins to walk faster and faster, now running down the stairs while carrying the strange soda can. As he bolts out the door some of the soda spills into the air, some of it landing on Peter. (Internal Monologue/ Breaking the fourth wall) ""Oh crap, the soda spilled on me! I can feel myself changing...Just kidding. Nothing is going to happen. Wouldn't that be funny though?""  
.....Peter is now outside behind his home. The scene is still shown through Peter's eyes. Lois appears outside a few yards away from Peter, but rather a dead person. Her eyes are black holes in her face and her clothes are tattered and ripped. At this point Lois says something threatening to Peter in a deep manly voice. As Peter is standing there Lois suddenly rips her arm from her body and throws it at Peter, but he deflects her attack by defending himself with a trashcan lid. Somehow Lois then manages to hurl her other arm at Peter which he also dodges. Lois is now standing there with no arms, blood dripping from her sides where he arms were previously. Despite this disadvantage she is able to detach her penis and throw it at Peter. Lois, now coming to terms with her bodily condition, yells at Peter, ""WHY AM I STILL ALIVE!?"" Suddenly she charges towards Peter. Instinctively he grabs her/him by the neck and twists until her/his head comes off in his hands. The head is now skinless and resembles a decomposed skull. Peter runs over to the side of his home where he places the skull onto a compartment on the back of Stewie's tricycle. Stewie seems to know what to do and launches the skull into the sky.....As this happens the scene shows a view of the sky

I was making a drive from my house in the northwestern corner or NC down to the flatlands to visit a friend. My car broke down in the middle of nowhere so I took to walking. I came across a small cabin a little ways off the trail and knocked on the door. A grizzled old man answered. As I explained my situation he threw me to the ground pinned me while another man bound my hands and feet. I blacked out.

When I came to I was tied to a post on the back porch of the cabin. Facing me were three men. They were discussing what they should do with me. Behind them in the yard was what looked like the edge of a cliff. I could hear the sound of falling water. Hanging around the roof of the porch were various farming tools, a hatchet, etc. 

One man went inside the cabin and I began speaking to the other two. They didn't speak very good english and had heavy appalachian dialects. I convinced them that I wasn't going to run and they untied me. As soon as the ropes were off I made my move. I hit the closest man with an upper cut to the chin, larger man. We exchanged several blows before I was able to get underneath him and take his legs out from under him, flipping him backwards over the railing of the porch. He landed head first on a rock and went unconscious. 

About that time I could hear the third man running through the cabin. I grabbed a hammer and a meat cleaver that were hanging near me. I hid by the door frame and as soon as the man stepped through I hit him with the hammer, striking me in the back. I turned and threw the cleaver at him, hitting him clean in the face. It stuck, killing him. 

By then they first man I hit had awakened and was chasing after me. I did the only thing I could do

This morning felt different, but I simply rolled over and closed my eyes once again.  I had some trouble falling back asleep, and my brain started doing its best to convince me to get up.


As time passed, took care of some mild but urgent business, and walked into my computer room to look at the weather forecast for the day.  


The door creaked a little as I opened it.  My heart shocked my system when I abruptly noticed a previously absent bed in the room on which lay my sleeping brother.  My computer and desk were gone, nor was anyone at all, in fact, I immediately knew that I was dreaming. This realization annoyed me.  I didn't like that I had been so tricked by my own mind. 


I concentrated on waking up.  


With success, unforeseen encounter with the past, I swung my legs over the side of my bed and sat on the edge.


""Headooe..."" said a *cutesy*


""Hey, I felt myself become physically astonished.  What really stuck out to me was how happy she was, and then how that happiness turned to an uneasy confusion, and then to a downright fear at my reaction to her presence in my bed.


I couldn't bring myself to say any more, Walter.  That was reassuring.  A piece of myself, of normalcy.  But everything else was not normal.  Her *stuff* was everywhere in the apartment.  Her tall, oak bookshelves, her overly large flat-screen TV that we had fought about when she bought it, the table we had set up as a coffee table...they were all present.  There they sat, despite my having spent the last week and a half growing accustomed to their absence after she moved out.  


A sudden terror came over me, relief that I wasn't losing my mind.  Then, annoyance at having been fooled again, and then a frustration that it had taken so long for me to realize this.  


I concentrated on waking up.


Once again successful, nor was it ever mine.  The couch was strewn with text books from subjects I hadn't ever studied.  I cast them aside and sat abruptly down in their place, taking a deep breath.  


I concentrated on waking up.


I met failure, but nothing happened.  I was still sitting on the couch next to the unrecognized text books among the unrecognized furniture.  Once again, I was losing a battle with incomprehensible confusion.  I began to question whether or not that was my actual reality and I somehow didn't remember getting rid of my fish, moving in this extra furniture, and apparently taking different classes.  But I knew this wasn't true.  For some reason, I was completely sure that this was a dream.  


This sureness brought with it a new set of confused questions buzzing through my mind.  Why couldn't I wake myself up?  Could it be that I would never wake?  Maybe, but I did know one thing for certain.  I knew that I had my alarm set and I knew that its time was coming.


So, I stayed where I was on that imaginary couch, trapped in my own mind.


Every minute crawled by and I didn't try to keep track of them.  Time seemed to pass in my dream in equal speed as reality.  Still



""Brrrriiing,"" and I snapped awake.  It had worked, and I *knew* it had worked this time.  I lay there for a moment letting the relief settle itself into me and I realized how interesting my encounter had been.  I had passed through about two years worth of time, each chunk of passage being represented by waking up on an imaginary morning.  I came to the conclusion that the last ""waking-up event"" was a future event.  I will be getting a roommate for my next lease, and the furniture and books must have represented my mind's prediction of his presence.

He's waiting for you inside. You'll die if you go past the entrance."" Then I see him (more like feel him - he radiates what I can only describe as an aura in blue).

I'm in a school building. I have an overwhelming feeling of terror. I have to get out of here. I start trying various doors around the premises. All are locked. I reach a hallway eventually that has green velvet carpet covering everything but the doors. One door has a light fixture above it. I go to the door and try the handle and then I feel them. There's a class full of... things in there. At the head of the room

I'm back to the original setting, 6 to the left and 6 to the right of the corner. On the far right, a light fixture is above the door. Every other door has a black X burned into it. They have light fixtures too, but the light is off. The fixtures look old and rusted. I go to the door with the light and try the handle. It's not locked and I feel someone beyond the door.

**For the first one -** 

I was at school again (even though I haven't been in school for about 4 years). I never went to school with my current girlfriend but in this dream I did. During recess I was out at the back circle street area where the parents pick up their kids. I started smoking some weed (It's been even longer since I smoked weed then it's been since I've been in school) and I got way too high. It's like it must have been laced with something. Then all of a sudden I am stumbling across the playground and everybody knows that I am high and they are taunting me about it. I can not form a coherent sentence and they begin taunting me about that too. I'm not just hearing them

Finally I run off and back to the circle parent pick up area (I can still hear the voices in my head) and I see my girlfriend look back. We lock eyes and I know that she knows that I was smoking pot (she would NOT like that very much) and what happened on the playground. She looks scared of me like because I am high I might hurt her or something. Then she takes off running away from me towards her car. I chase after her as fast as I can but she gets in the car and drives away. 

After that I woke up. When I finally went back to sleep the dream that waited for me was even worse. 

**The second dream -**

I was at some kind of concert hall for a band performance of some kind and my girlfriend was supposed to meet me there the next day. I was sitting there practicing and this girl that I hadn't seen in forever walks in. I had no idea what she was doing there. (I had a huge crush on this girl for the longest time when we were younger but I never went out with her because she lived too far away for us to be able to see each other often. We talked a lot back then on the phone and computer. One day she told me that she was dating this girl that she had met and was a lesbian. We still talked a lot for years after that but eventually just fell out of contact.)

So here she is and she walks up and starts telling me how much she has missed me and I give her a quick ""How've you been?!"" hug but she holds on extra long. I look up and she brushes her cheek against mine

The next morning my girlfriend shows up and for some reason I am scared to tell her what happened. I'm trying to get through the day without running into the girl when I see the girl's mom walking around looking really upset (The girl's mom and I were pretty close. She is a really nice lady). I think ""Oh fuck

1366590943.0,1ctzik,A fantasty-like dream turned sentimental,DarthWilly,8,3,0,"I pre-written this out on other forums to share there. Lots of people praised my writing

Although it's mostly blurry from my memory

The dreams starts off a bit random. I was known around the world as an all powerfull witch/demon hunter that can choose either to execute them or be their saviour and force their master to release their contract with them so they can lead a normal life. It sounds like something straight from a manga/anime to me. But then it starts getting more sentimental.

After 10 years(time goes by fast in a dream), being a complete badass flying around this area where there was complaints of a powerful witch and a demon child causing havoc around a village(the dream takes place around 1800s sceneary). By the time I arrived, they were being driven out by the villagers. Still having to do the job, I swooped in and snatched them from the ground and flew off to the main town to start the ceromony.

I paid no mind to them as I flew over there since it felt like I did this multiple times already. The flight was eerily quiet. I felt the witch gaze upon me, her face was turned away. The hair was unique but familiar to me. Most witches had straight or wavy hair, similar to all the villagers, but she had long curly hair. I knew someone who had such hair in high school but paid it no mind. We arrive to the town center to start the ceremony. I descended down while the two of them are still in my arms, making sure I do not let go at all. The demon child looked like any demon child(well to the dream me) Budding horns and a whip like tail. I turn to the witch to see her face but she still refused to show it. Being so used to talking to witches and demons, I joked around with her. I told her, ""Mind showing me your face? I'll get a villager kid for you and you can eat them before I execute or free you."" I heard a small giggle and the witch faced me

What I saw was a big shock to me. Behind all the hair was a girl I knew named Caroline, smiled at me and said, ""I want that kid!"" I immediately went into a rage. I screamed with all my might to summon their master. Caroline pleaded to not summon him while the child just looked sullen. A burst of flame appeared before me. The flame slowly turned black and formed a devil-like being: pure black clothing, pale skin, red sunken eyes, elongated fangs, and tattered bat wings. When he took shape, ""Hello son. It's been a pretty long time!"" ""8 f*cking years!"" proclaimed the child. The master just laughed and turned to Caroline. ""Have you been treating him well?"" She started screaming and thrashing about

I did what no executioner/freer did for over 100s of years. There is a mutual agreement that it's the witch's/demon's fault for making a contract with the evil beings and they should be punished. The evil beings are just doing what is in their nature. However

It is said when an executioner/freer kills the master in a fit of rage, humans dead everywhere. Half awake, I try standing up and notice I was then surrounded by a legion of witches and demons. They knelt down to my presence. Apparently, I become their new master for the old one was killed by me. The only one standing was Caroline and the demon child, still awe strucken.

I became conscious of my surroundings after a few minutes of standing. A single tear flowed from Caroline's eye. I took everyone's contract and destroyed them all, which felt like trying to rip steel into two. Caroline coughed up blood as the contract ripped while the demon child followed suit. I felt my life force slowly exiting my body but all the witches and demons I recently freed, still knowing magic, each gave some of their life force to me. Enough for me to stay alive.

I awoken again half awake next to Caroline and the child's limp bodies. The villagers of the next village over heard the news and decided to hunt me down. I hear shouting of my name from a mob and decided to run. Without thinking

I take a rest, sleeping away. A gentle smile came across my face. I slowly stroked Caroline's hair and fell asleep.

This is where the dream started getting blurry. I don't remember exact details but I got the general gist of this sequence. It was a 3 year timespan of Caroline slowly trying to trust me. I try to come to terms I lost all my executioner/freer powers and that I am now human. I find out the child's name is Zachary and he slowly starts seeing me as a father figure. Caroline finally starts trusting me after seeing how I treated Zach as my own child. We fell in love

Caroline comes home after working, as long as she is ok now. She decided to go on my back in a piggy back ride like hold. I turn around to look at her but she hid her face. ""Go kneel down beside the wall and fall asleep on it like you did before..."" she whispered. I asked her if she was ok and said it might be very uncomfortable. She reassured me, saying, ""I like this feeling the most..."" I complied to her demand and we both fell asleep like how we did when I first brought her there. I woke up earlier than her, Caroline still sleeping on my back. I gently take her to my bed and laid her down carefully. I quietly called Zachary over and asked if he can sleep with his mother for ol time sakes. He complies, adding in he's sleepy anyways. They huddle together like how they did years back while I went to bed on a separate bed I gotten where I fell asleep.

I slowly awaken by a soft warm breathe tickling my ear. I slowly turn around to see Caroline cuddling next to me. The same gentle smile came across my face again and whispered in her ear, ""I love you too."" She gave me a little kiss while she fell back asleep. Life felt bliss on that little moment. I fell back asleep in my dream, feeling as content as can be.


The dream ended and I awoke in my own bed, even though it felt so real. I finally swallowed the fact, it was just a dream. I went to the bathroom, washed my face off and came here to type this out. This dream felt so real and I truly wished it happend. I never had a dream felt so meaningful to me. I felt the need to just... vent it out. I may seem like a betafag right now, but if you took the time to actually read all this, thank you. ",,,,

1362717411.0,19w73c,Is it common to have episodic dreams?,HerbaceousMeteor,7,0,3,"obviously you know the following will be an uninteresting and ridiculous story of which the length I wish I had the skill to summarize

I created this thread because recently and over several nights I have had a series of dreams where I was part of some sort of story, in my mind a sort of shaman, also two young brothers, a herculean (but also very intelligent) young adult man, a little girl, and many others I do not have the memory to describe.

In the first dream we were in the grasslands and I can't remember why we had to leave

 The second night that this story occured in my dreams I also remember little except that I ended up wounded, I remember almost nothing, but I do remember being on an ice flow and all seemed well having been resuscitated by the shaman.

Last night I dreamt that on our ice flow the residents where we had stopped. Tried to build a cylindrical tower, the shaman, the young man, and the girl, rushed into the tower in a sort of panic. As they reached the top of the tower it collapsed and they fell into the sea. I called for the young strong man to pull the part that they were all in out of the sea and with his immense strength he retrieved it.
I peered inside and there were nothing but corpses, and the girl, in their grief, decided to all take something the shaman had concocted during my first dream to commit suicide. I did not argue with them on this but I decided to go my own way, saying that as a wolf I could live without them. I made my way awkwardly away from them as I heard them all coughing, and woke up.

I have had this sort of episodic structure of dreams happen many times before

So I'm driving away again, with weird shapes reaching down to the ground, and they're all moving and shifting a lot.  All the clouds are nice and white, but the one directly behind me is the only one that's dark and stormy, almost black.  I pull over into a McDonalds to get something to eat.

I'm at home now, and inside the corridors of the building it's windy too.  I finally reach my room and step inside and it's just a small room, with red carpeting and dark wood paneling on the walls, and a couple small tables with wrought iron lamps for light.  On the floor are toys and a small TV (the old-fashioned kind that look like they're in a big radio box).  I turn on the TV and its suddenly like my dream becomes an old B&amp;W Mickey Mouse cartoon, but it's really awful and depressing.  The title card plays dreary music (like on a warped record phonograph) and it reads, “The Day Mickey Lost EVERYTHING,” with the “everything” in big letters.  The narrator comes on and starts explaining things, but still whispering.  It shows Mickey sitting in an armchair looking sad, all the objects are anthropomorphic; they all have faces and they twist in agony as they melt and vanish).  He does this with a few more items in the room, and I'm supposed to be Mickey.  The toys in the room have all assembled into a weird Rube Goldberg machine

To begin

When I moved into my apt I started dating someone who is now my ex. I didn't know him previous to moving, but in these dreams his friend and I were having a romantic relationship. In one vivid dream I was looking into his blue eyes and just knew that's where I belonged. In another, we found a black and white kitten with bright green eyes. Two weeks later I was hanging out with him and we spotted a kitten exactly like the one in my dream right next to the cemetery. We caught him and named him Cecil. A month after finding the kitten, I admitted to my ex's friend that I loved him and he just knew it too. Although he denies my dreams had anything to do with us eventually being together. Which hurts because those dreams were what lead me up to admitting my feelings towards him. However, I broke up with my ex to pursue the literal dreams I had.

In between my relationship with my current boyfriend I had a dream of him getting back with one of his ex's. Which ultimately did happen

I haven't had a dream or encounter with this woman for over 6 months now. I will admit I've been staying at my boyfriends far too often.

Wake up in a back garden somewhere, I also find out at this point I have an extra toe for some reason.

I emerge in a kitchen, if anything it's an amalgamation of about 3 different kitchens I've seen in my life. There's a family in there, all a bit loopy to be honest. I explain to them that I'm a time traveler sent back to stop ww2. They interrupt me, get freaked out by my extra toe, and then decided to threaten me with knives, blades and any sharp objects they have, it resulted in a strange Mexican standoff as I threaten the kid with a blade, but I turned the tables

But then we got word that something was happening back at the homestead so we took the horses down and seen some men dead at the side of the road with huge chunks out of their necks
I got out my colt m1911 pistol and shot them both in the head and told everyone i knew what was going on so i became the defacto leader of the workers.

We had a large group, bacon and an avocado for some strange reason. We went back and there was reports of a huge wave of zombies coming and some lawmen arrived and we fought against waves of zombies, but that isn't even the best part.

I actually woke up for a minute or two and went right back to sleep again


We had to leave them behind. I was obviously the leader of the law men and in turn the leader of the whole god darned zombie resistance back at the homestead! And the most INSANE thing was i seen myself back at the homestead with the workers. Actually ME like i was looking in the mirror but then i knew i was someone else and it excited me too much.

Well

There are a few big settings where i dream (dream locations). If i picture a movie theater that was in my dream, that also triggers me remembering a plethora of dreams. It seems that almost every single one of my dreams shares a location with another. The thing is, these aren't real locations, but rather my mind manifesting and changing real locations. 
The movie theater doesn't exist as far as i know in real life, it's still very different, yet from dream to dream it is almost identical. 
Ok

And for the Deja-vu. I have a theory, but i find it interesting. 

Ok, it can often be about things happening in real life. ei; you and your girlfriend break up, you have a dream about her etc etc. Or you just got a new job, you have a dream about being on the job. 
But when you're in that dream
But plenty of dreams can relate back to your real life
Right. 
But it isn't until after we wake up do we realize that ""Ohhh.. that big strawberry ice cream cone rampaging my city, which induces my irritability..""

Now, but your consciousness is traveling to other dimensions or lives, and experiencing a parallel universe, that can bleed and seep into our own.
The dream world is as real as the one you're sitting in right now. 

Now wait.. If that were true, can form into a dream, symbolic or not. But we have also established that you don't really find the symbols until you try to connect them, after the dream is over. But how can a dream form into our world?

Ah, (sometimes longer) are memories, not deja-vu. Perhaps you actually HAVE experienced this before, in a dream state. Perhaps dreams affect are way of living more than we realize, yet we cannot realize until we wake up from the dream we are all in right now.

If you guys could recommended certain things to do before I go to sleep and maybe some vitamins that I could get from the supermarket, that would be awesome.

How much would self-hypnosis help with dream recall? Like where you imagine yourself standing at the top of 10 stairs and slowly walking down into water telling yourself something that you want your subconscious self to remember. It's something along the lines of that.

I'll definitely try to write down as much as I can about my dreams before I go to school. I used to keep a journal when I was working on Lucid Dreaming and I remember that it helped me out a lot.

From what I can understand, this meant that the Earth's atmosphere would soon be destroyed by this odd solar storm/hurricane/thunderstorm and that all life on Earth would cease to exist.

My dream began at a party in this reality, golden-lit, and bright. Many people I knew were there, my friends, family, girlfriend, etc... As the 40 minute mark would approach, the party would resume and  the ""piano would continue playing."" if that makes any sense. At the next 40 minute mark, we see one flare shoot up... Followed by another. My heart sunk. Although the room and the house were still golden lit it seemed like the atmosphere had suddenly plunged into darkness. Everyone remained speechless and in shock. The world would end then, but I didn't know how best to comfort her knowing that the world would end. Personally I wasn't that scared


I don't know if my dream had any meaning to it, but not in the general sense. It was a beautiful thing to watch, the storm, and, I didn't know how to react or what to fear because no matter what this was it. The world was ending. There was nothing to be afraid of, at the moment, that was just the very nature of things and I accepted it.

It starts off with a little boy of about 12 years old. He comes home and is told by an uncle, especially since said uncle is getting a blow job in the next room (o.O;). A father figure comes home and kicks the uncle out and helps his son with the homework. For some reason, my dream could tell that this father was the main character. 

The next day a beautiful girl is entered into the story. The scene is outside and I realize that it's set in the countryside with vast expanses of fields and forests in every direction. The father is talking to the girl and the dialogue went something along the lines of how none of this feels right, himself, herself, and even the son. Something just feels off. So they go back inside and the boy asks if they remember anything about this place since yesterday. No one can recall any memories and each person becomes deeply concerned. 

The scene changes and now I enter the dream, a girl of about the same age (maybe beautiful woman's daughter?), and myself are in a clearing inside the forest. We're searching the woods for something and it seems like a long time passes by. Then I hear a rustling in the trees and we chase after the noise to find another boy, around the same age as us. I'm carrying a sharp metal spear which I plunge into the boy's ribs. It went in easily and the boy drops back into a small fountain.

The scene changes again to the father, starting fires and explosions everywhere. Everyone is now screaming in terror and running for their lives. The father starts running, calling for his son. 

Back in the forest we see what's happening and run towards the city, but now the machines have come to harvest and we're completely ill prepared. Swarms of machines are flying out of the tip of the gigantic spaceship and are gathering people up in a scooping-like fashion. I shove the little boy's face into the water and run for my life, towards the city, leaving the poor boy to drown...

1356697774.0,15kjji,Deja vu: From dreams to reality,miyubear,6,1,5,"So
Most of the time it's location
For some examples... Last year I moved to Quebec for University and I was driving up one street with my mother and was looking around and realised that that exact street had been in a dream I'd had a while back, and even stores themselves. Also, this past september I was driving across the country with my best friend's mother and we stopped in Thunder Bay(her home town) and she showed me where she went to high school, and I realised that I'd had a dream placed there. In fact, almost everywhere I went to in Thunder Bay gave me the feeling of deja vu. It also happened when I was in Italy. 

Every place I go and have a deja vu of the area, however I've always been skeptical that that's what it is since often it will be a legitimate dream in the location I go to later. And not just a stroll through, but a legitimate dream with people I know, and conversations, and situations that don't happen when I actually get to the place.

I guess what I'm here for is just some input on what people think might be causing this? Or what they think about it? Do they get it as well? Because this stuff has been happening to me since as long as I can remember

Also, I had a dream in the little town at the end where the mother and son take refuge. And in my dream the town is overrun by zombies. So when I saw that movie, and I remembered that dream, it was really very strange for me.",,False,,False,t3_15kjji

I had by then reached a small meadow between two forests. I looked into the forest I had just made my way out of and saw a tiger lurking between the trees in my direction. Yet unaware of my presence. I ran into the other forest which was very small. For some reason I waited for the tiger to come. It did. I layed my hands on it carefully and somehow tamed the tiger. It became very cuddly and I stroke him.

Later I were going to make my way back through another path in the forest I first came from. But along this path it was suddenly dark and creepy. A very depressing place. I had the feeling that there were things out there that wanted to get me and that I had to run to a safe spot. (I live in Sweden and the Scandinavian forests aren't places were you would expect to see tigers and such.) Suddenly I saw a beam of strong bright light that descended from the sky right down in the middle of nowhere in the forest. I felt that that was the spot I would be safe from all dangers and I was running towards that place. I don't remember if I ever got there or not.

Warning: This dream is kinda messed up/gory/possibly uncomfortable for some to read.

The part of the dream that I can remember starts off where I am walking alone through a quiet, though; it looks like it could be any Midwestern US suburb on a summer's day. There is not a cloud in the sky and because of the beautiful weather, families are out walking together, often with dogs. Everybody is smiling and courteous as I pass them, and they act as if I am familiar to them, perhaps a neighbor. This continues for about four or five blocks, when I notice a mother and son, behaving quite differently. The child is about four or five years old, the punishment continues, but there are two horrifying things on the lawn. On the left hand side

I then woke up and nope'd to the bathroom and started my day. It's been bothering me all day long. Do any of you know what to make of this dream? Is it nonsensical or do you think it could possibly have some sort of interpretable meaning?

There was no supervision or anything in the bathroom, something about boats . . . it was hard, though. And I was doing two exams at once, so I had little time. After finishing and comparing notes with the other people in my class, they mentioned questions I hadn't done, so I had this sickening realisation that I had actually just not seen about half of the paper due to being an idiot.

By this point I was back at S block, though he wasn't driving. He seemed a little perplexed by everything as well. So the bus was driving, gradually getting faster, and we were driving through a big city at night. There were bloody overpasses everywhere. Eventually, I noticed some of the other buses – driving at breakneck speeds by now – had started to lift off the ground. I barely had time to hold onto my lunch before ours took off too. However, whoever was driving the bus decided that just that wasn't good enough for him, so it proceeded to barrel roll several times before I blacked out – from G-force or fear

Then I 'woke up' and realised the part about the island had been a dream. I'd fallen asleep on the bus home after my exam, but they were understanding and quite indignant I'd been made to sit two at once.

	But for a gleaming hilt embedded in the belly of a young girl's corpse, the girl seemed to have met her untimely fate alone; omitting her thoughts. Most of those thoughts were along the lines of a plea for a divine specter barging to her aid, or what folly if not of her own had led her to the godforsaken ballast in which she lay. 
	The lapse of course, relict was a man of obvious disrepute, yet in the same instance, of affluent mannerism. After the girls father had      died and left her mother a lonely dowager; the girls mother had begun to indulge her less than frugal ways. Partaking in glutton and sot, living on credit she had no intention of remitting, and as a result, being forced to either breath her last or relinquish her only daughter as recompense. The latter being much below her maternal par. 
	The girls name was Alice, sack in hand, carriage in rear. After a rather deplorable sequence of events, Alice reluctantly abandoned her pitiful attempts at combat with the man and took the bag as a mask. 
	After a short stint in the carriage, bag and all onto an outstandingly dreadful looking vessel and into a small room where her cowl was removed, and promptly tossed to the floor. The girls safety was not all the gang of brutes stole from her. Shortly after the girl was aboard, the crew raised anchor and set off to the blue with their new captive. After a few days, the girl had lost all sense of decency and whenever a privateer would make his unannounced entrance,  she would savagely lash out, fists and feet connecting with anything they could reach
	After a week, thrust her into the barracks of the crew, entirely bare. Her shrieks could be heard for a very long ways away. After another week of similar, barbaric treatment, Alice was called to the well dressed mans quarters. Upon arrival, she was learned in her mothers untimely demise, the reason of which
	A day passed before she was moved from her 'room' to her the ballast, and a crewmen materialized in the opening. As her innocence was finally shattered entirely, the girl's will was also having reached the point of complete deterioration. A thought occurred to the girl as she reached for her assailant's bodkin with a quick flick of her wrist, her attacker's throat spat red, and he fell to the floor, rendered silent by his own claret. With a second motion, the blade dove into her abdomen. The girl coughed and sputtered, a line of her own clot running off her mouth
	She lay there for what seemed to be merest a day, or to her mother who she so dearly longed for. Never having learned the initial reason for her capture, she fought the urge to cry for the answer, but thought better of it, and decided to end her ordeal with what little amount of dignity she had left, and with her final thoughts being those of the warmth of her childhood, family unbroken and herself as pure as can be, then went out entirely and the young girl met the maker she had been so longing to aid her.

I was at a dark, were characters in the video game [*The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind*](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mafy7t3UVA1rgi02uo1_500.jpg). The beat of the song [*Puttin' On the Ritz*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG3PnQ3tgzY) was playing on a loop. It wasn't a very good party. While talking with a few people of no particular importance, but i'm eerily curious

We're now deeper in the Alleyway. There's a door with an illegible plaque on it. The dark figure takes a quick glance at me and walks inside. I start slowly walking towards the door, full of crates and cardboard boxes. The woman is about 10 feet away from me. She turns around towards me, and the hair she was wearing before is now a cloak. She takes off the cloak, and transforms into a vicious werewolf (nothing to do with the game now). She starts to drool, as if hungry. I realize immediately afterwards that i've delved too deep, and I need to leave. I slowly step back, with every step she responds by getting closer. I open the door

I'm back at the party. By this time there aren't as many people as there were before. The party is even darker than it was. There are also chain-link fences that have enclosed off the area. At this point, but I still feel like i'm too easily seen. Eventually, I see her. She's coming towards me at a steady pace. I can see the beast in her eyes now. I start walking away from her. By the time i'm about to break into a sprint, she catches up with me, starts to devour me, and I wake up in a sweat and breathing heavily.

I've used http://www.dreammoods.com/ to determine what some of the symbols mean

EDIT: I suppose I should give my interpretation

Well, there's a temptation that's hiding as something that isn't what it seems. Having the werewolf appear in the warehouse possibly means that if i give into a particular temptation, i'll let go of my ambitions.

The almost constant darkness possibly means that i'm fearful of things that are as of yet unknown to me. The growing darkness at the party following my encounter with the werewolf possibly means failure, sexual repression, and the bad party seems to represent a lack of confidence with my social skills. Also, the music is cacophonous, representing that i'm unhappy. The chains that appear after the encounter seem to represent me needing to break free from an old idea or a routine. Perhaps, in this, i'm fearful of failure in life and my sociability. When I get back to the party, and I need to break free from this particular act that is harming my potential.

I seem to suddenly remember that the door sign was similar to a signature. I just couldn't read it. Perhaps this represents me making a commitment to something without taking the time to examine it

One thing I shouldn't forget is that this is a chase dream. It's me chasing something/somebody, and i'll need to let go of my personal identity.

2nd EDIT: Another symbol I forgot to bring out is the fact that this is involves parts of a video game, the fact that parts of this dream are in the format of this video game, perhaps I lack any ambition.

I was in the living room listening to music on what appeared to be my phone when I looked at the door and saw the shape of a childs head, but then when I tried to tell someone about it, I couldn't speak and had the feeling that I had a bad sore throat.

Soon after I went to take off my headphones becuase this same song has been droning on for now what feels like hours, which are the ones I usually use. 

Now it worked, with it raining pretty hard with lightning and no thunder, due to the inability to hear. Next I turned to the door again where the mercury-like figure still loomed. I went to go attack it to get it away and it vanished into the outside area after I hit it a few times. My brother then runs out into the storm after me freaking out about it, when apparently no one else could see it. He runs up to the neighbors house and just sits there like a dummy for a bit then runs back to our house. As he is running back, he falls through the boards on our porch and I go to grab him to pull him up becuase I knew the thing was going to go after him down there. I get him to safety and we get inside to the living room.

Soon after we do this, I can squeeze out a few words like something is blocking my throat, which is still sore. My mom and sister think I should look it up so I do, the webpage then shows most of the things that occured along with the explanation for the music.

The explanation was simple.




You're dreaming





Then I actually wake up and hear the song that has played throughout the entire dream, fortunately.

I first remember seeing a few friends in the back of a two cars which were parker next to each other and they were all smoking and chilling. I remember having a few conversations with people and peering at my friend gary through the the car window. I hopped out and everyone was gald to see I was back home. I tried to talk to my friend gary
	Teleported out to my friend wills house which ended up being very mystical
	I was so upset that I had gone back into town on calvins longboard and I found a cellphone in the cement and I picked it up. When I picked it up the long board slipped out from underneath me and slid over to a party full of bikers and other rough characters. My friend Dillon yeager came over to me because the party was at his house. I asked him if that was his cellphone
	Now I was at an area that consisted of a gas station from my hometown which is always in my dreams, and asked me if I had been convicted of a sin, or a wrongdoing. After trying to explain to him that I was good I went into a paralytic state and magically was sliding on the ground in between this ledge and station wall. My eyes were open this entire time while sliding and I went around a corner and at this point I am on an enclosed top boat.
	On this boat two demonic presences were pacing back and forth in a very sinister manner. A man spoke out and was harmed and then thrown off the boat. I tried to go attack the spirit with my bare hands and it grabbed me. While it grabbed me he stared into my eyes and let me down. While he did this I saw a demon or two resembling Golem from lord of the rings jump from the rocky shore of which we were departing from. The demon spoke words I cannot express. We ended up finding our way to an island which was inhabited by demonic spirits. In this town it was not safe to walk out of certain doors of certain establishments. It was not wise to wonder to far from a building. I was with Makenzie walking over to a building that had kids partying in it. All the buildings consisted of kids partyin in it. I walked around this building and I lost Makenzie. I went out back and found her but a dog approached me and I rubbed its belly. Two boys came out of the building and said hey you cant be out there. I knew he meant it was because of the demons. It was so real it was not funny. Makenzie and I walked down to the dock where the shore was and all of the water was what our cloudy skys look like at dusk. The perception of my surrounding was very opposite to that of a normal setting. At this point the scenery faded and I woke up.

The first part of it that I remember is of me and someone else (I don't remember who) in some kind of corridor. the walls were made of concrete, and we were trying to get to an exit, there was a profound sense of dread at this point, and as we turned a corner, we came face-to-face with 3 aliens. they were bigger than an average human, and had very thick legs, which looked like an elephant's, each ending in 3 fingers. Their bodies were grey, about 3 feet long, shiny eyes
 
Needles to say, when one of the aliens held out it's hand to me, fingers open, as if telling me to wait. It then took a single step towards me and lowered it's face until it was level with mine, and I heard in my head, a deep, long-winded and breathy voice, and it just looked at me, all ""speaking"" in the same voice

 
The next part I remember, to which it would reply ""Want"", then we would talk about things such as philosophy, physics, food, human behavior (I would occasionally try to explain religion to it, but it would always just slowly shake it's head and ""Sigh"" sadly).
Then one time, so they mostly kept to themselves), I was rounding the corner when I decided to eavesdrop on their conversation. I had another deep sense of dread at this point and a feeling that the aliens were planning something malicious, but as I listened, they were only talking about carrots tasting weird.

The last part of the dream takes place 2 years after, and he replied that their ""Purpose"" was ready, and that I would be ""the one who would see"". I asked if they were going to destroy or enslave us, and he blinked in shock, and ""said"" ""No. Help."" so I asked if they had only come to help us and he replied ""Not only"". So I asked what he meant, and he ""said"" ""Help us too. everyone."" then he told me I needed to ""Open"". I was confused until he sent me an image of a person opening his 3rd eye. So I sat in lotus position, and imagined a third eye opening in my forehead
The landscape looked like there was a sandstorm and a blizzard going on at once, round, hockey-puck shaped craft flying slower. They were all shooting at each other, it was quite chaotic. I somehow knew (the way you sometimes just know things in dreams) that all this was caused by human technology, or more specifically, the things we were feeding our technology.
I closed my third eye, (it was like the passenger seat of a car) there were no controls, in fact there was nothing but the window and the seat. I sat in the seat and opened my third eye and the craft started to rise. I guided it with my thoughts, dodging the other craft and their bullets, and broke through the storm/blizzard. after that I just remember flashes of flying the little craft through a vast red dessert, I thought it was mars, but I can't be sure.

I've had this same dream several times and I think its probably quite unique.

I'm sort of in a huge, some seem to be pure evil.
Its hard to explain, strange, I know.

However its not this that bothers me
When the 'bad' boulders collect, death and depression. Somehow it feels like its truly the end and the whole world is against me. Now imagine those emotions I just described x100, and then some. In the dream I feel like that, while hearing horrible sounds of people screaming at me. Its literally the worst feeling ive ever experienced, regardless of the fact its in a dream.

Then the bad boulders defeat the good ones again and the cycle continues for what seems like hours.

""What? Speak up

I was quite intrigued by him and felt very at peace and comfortable talking to him. He then begins to kiss my head, and I enjoyed it, but it seemed deeper than lust. We were connected, in some way or another.

I may get up and get something to eat but I will usually go back to sleep.  It is during those times when I have the most amazing dreams.  The most recent one I can recall is this:

I was hiking through some sort of canyon with a group of friends when something caught my eye on the side of a huge cliff wall.  It was some sort of button mechanism, much larger than the size of the cliff would suggest could be inside of it.  The city was made up of huge pillars, miles high.  And walking throughout the city were massive humanoid creatures.  I would estimate them to be several stories tall.  My friends and I stared at the sight before us for a few seconds, unable to even process what we were seeing.  Suddenly our eyes grew wide, as beams of light shot out of them, and we all fell back.  I can't tell if we were dead or not, but after that I either drifted off into a different dream

Basically, and the world just looks more grey and miserable than I've ever seen in real life, more like a movie.

Naturally, I swerve over and park in the shoulder a bit further down, and get out and grab the kid, I start searching for someone who must be the kid's parent. In not very long, I realize this figure is holding another child, had the stature of a small woman in her 60's or 70's

1344618960.0,y078y,I dreamed of a disease.,sleepdirt,7,3,1,"I was sitting on a beach with my Korean friend Jin. We were on an embankment of sand looking out at the ocean several yards away. There was that strange green beach grass around us and I could feel it scratching my leg making me itchy. 

""Do you know what they're calling it yet?"" I asked of Jin. He's a pre-med student and I often picked his brain. 

""Menarius I think."" He stared at the ocean not making eye contact with me. I told him I thought the name sounded stupid and he did not respond. 

Our conversation was in reference to a sickness that was killing everyone. It was not in the air

Down the beach a bit was a small gathering of people enjoying the hot sun. Nothing left to do but keep on living

As I watched the quaint scene play out on the sand I heard a piercing scream from the water. Female. I jumped up and Jin did the same beside me. I recognized the girl. 

Her name was Erin and I had gone out on a few dates with her but blew it. It didn't diminish my affection for her and I always wondered if we would get back together. Now she was screaming and trying to pull herself out of the water. 

""Menarius"" Jin said beside me quietly. There was nothing we were going to be able to do. 

Erin was trying to get herself out of the water. The top half of her body had made it to the sand but water still crashed down on her legs and up to her waist. When the ocean would roll back out

""Something about the salt in the water is making it worse"" Jin told me. I didn't understand but nor did I question. Onlookers on the beach simply stood there. Some covered their faces with their hands. Some were on cell phones. No one could touch her. They just had to watch her struggle. 

Jin and I left the sandy hill and stood on the beach proper a bit in front of the ocean staring down. Erin had gone white and was wailing through her tears. 

Suddenly Jin grabbed my arm and yanked me aside

I heard her screaming ""Daddy"" at the sight of him and begging for his help. Without hesitation he ran to his daughter and pulled her up to the dry shore, tried to comfort her as best he could. 

Not wanting to see anymore the two of us turned away and began to walk down the beach in the opposite direction. Members of the small beach crowd did the same,False,,t5_2qmbx,False,,,t3_y078y

 I turned over to turn on the little light beside my bed and it won't turn on. Usually this is my tell that I'm dreaming, angled like a snake about to strike. I calmly run out of the room, hoping the thing won't notice how scared I am. I find my father is downstairs, and notice that it is 6:58am. I'm shaking and trying to explain what is scaring me, when I notice the webcam thing is now floating at the top of the stairs. My cat runs upstairs to fight it, and I, frightened that it will hurt her, she starts to hiss and scratch at me. I wake up.
  
  I shift to turn on the light, where my brother is laying on the couch. I try and get his attention, but he's watching movies on his laptop. It says 6:58 on the screen. I notice a crying toddler is right outside the room. I go a bit towards it, before realizing that there should be no children in the house. I'm yelling at my brother to notice this child, as it runs towards me. As she collides with me, I ask him ""who is this, who is this?"" and he says ""Duh, my brother smiles and says ""Yeah
 
   Fully unnerved, and I'm awake, with tears still on my face.

 So I decide to get up and get on the computer cause I don't think I'll be sleeping again tonight. One note: As I was moving to turn on the room light

I'm on a couch in my grandparents small vacation home in North Carolina, it's fuzzy almost like a dog's ear.

I stand up and look around for the remote thinking that there has to be something worth watching, and the creek is babbling its way down the hollow into the forest, but nonetheless I can feel the hair standing on the back of my neck as something draws me out the front door.

I walk down the porch steps

I make my was down the hillside to the little bridge crossing the creek, checking if the coast is clear, then slink in. Every sort of old farm equipment one could imagine is hanging on the walls, or laying on the bare earth floor, but it is none of this that piques my interest. Instead it is the wide carpeted staircase to my left that draws me in.

I don't remember this? This barn has been around for longer than I have been alive and I don't recall ever seeing a staircase in it before?

Nervously I make my way up...ten...eleven...twelve...thirteen steps, but my curiosity is overwhelming, and I need to see more.

I walk through the room

This is the general state of things as I look around the rest of the place. A kitchen with rusted faucets, and walk back into the yard. I must be dreaming. This is beyond strange.

I put my first foot on the old wooden bridge leading back towards the house when I hear a pounding from the top of the barn. Like a deer in the headlights I freeze
