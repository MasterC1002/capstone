1283253595.0,d7ntl,I've had a vision and I can't shake it: Colbert needs to hold a satirical rally in DC.,mrsammercer,13382,7009,1350,"I was woken in the middle of the night by this(along with the sound of my cat getting ready to pee on the rug).

Think about it. It'll be just like Colbert's mockery of GW Bush at the 2006 White House Correspondent's Dinner

This would be the high water mark of American satire. Half a million people pretending to suspend all rational thought in unison. Perfect harmony. It'll feel like San Francisco in the late 60s

I know you're out there somewhere, which could be even more awesome.

Note: This is a repost. First one never popped into New.

**EDIT(Finally): The response to this post has blown my mind. I really did jump out of bed at like 5AM and type this thing up. Then I checked from work and it's front page and there's a Facebook page and people are emailing one of the Executive Producers. I was just hoping some people would get a laugh out of it

**But to be fair, and I think I'd opt for the ""Go back to the rug store with the rest of the Afghans"" sign. **

**I just wanted to say that I'm really happy that so many people got a kick out of it. And the thought of Colbert himself actually maybe seeing this is probably the coolest thing that's ever happened to me so far in life.**

Source:
""Go Daddy has a long history of supporting federal legislation directed toward combating illegal conduct on the Internet. For example, and the Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act of 2011 (PROTECT IP).  Go Daddy has always supported both government and private industry efforts to identify and disable all types of illegal activity on the Internet.  It is for these reasons that I’m still struggling with why some Internet companies oppose PROTECT IP and SOPA.  There is no question that we need these added tools to counteract illegal foreign sites that are falling outside the jurisdiction of U.S. law enforcement.  And there is clearly more that we could all be doing to adequately address the problems that exist.""

I'm in my late 20's (fuck)

We are technologically savvy and we have the ability to organize in a way that is incomprehensible to corporate entities and governmental bodies. We are faster

So here are the guiding principles I propose for the U.S. Pirate Party:

* Internet neutrality and progressive legislation regarding technology. ([1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_neutrality))

* Legalization and taxation of drugs

* Fiscal conservatism

* An end to corporate personhood. ([4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_personhood_debate))

* A Public Option health care system. ([5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO%27s_ranking_of_health_care_systems))

* Reducing the power of filibuster by restoring it to its original place in Senate procedure

* Eschew professional politicians in favor of politically knowledgeable  citizens interested in political positions. ([7](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cato_the_Elder))

* Campaign finance reform that prohibits corporations from giving money to a political candidate in any form. Only contributions from private citizens. ([8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance_reform))

That's what I've got. I don't want to put too many more down - I'd like to to be a collaborative effort. What tenets would you like to see on the official U.S. Pirate Party platform?

------------------

**note** Apparently the name, so I propose we make like pirates and take over the U.S. Pirate Party -or- change the name to the [American Pirate Party](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/arzh7/america_we_need_a_third_party_that_can_galvanize/c0j2yjv).

**note 2** I just created the [American Pirate Party](http://www.reddit.com/r/americanpirateparty/) sub-reddit. Post, so anyone who wants to mod this and help head up the party, just send me a message.

**note 3** To those who think the name is unrealistic. A name pales in comparison to the enthusiasm and dedication of those involved. The ridiculous-party-name barrier has already been broken for us very recently by the Tea Party. In comparison to that

**EDIT**:  Getting questions about accessing the data.  Click 'file - &gt; download' to save a .xlsx spreadsheet to your hard drive for easy manipulation.

The list includes congressional members' names, and their votes on the patriot act (2001), the reauthorization (2006), the Protect America Act (2007), FISA (2008), the patriot act extension (2011), the FISA extension (2012) and the Amash amendment (2013).  

It then attempts to tabulate an intrusion score based on the number of bad and good votes each number has made.  A high intrusion score means a member has done more damage to our privacy

Some of these data were tabulated from a table [shared in this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1jkmjf/what_real_reform_of_the_nsa_looks_like_holts/cbfy1kn)

There are three tabs:

**Master List**:  This is the first tab

**Key**:  This is the second tab

**Priority Contacts**:  Right now, the more worthwhile the call should be.

---

**What You Can Do**:

**I.  Call the names on the priority contacts list.**  

The list is in the data file linked above

When you dial the number

""Hi

If you are not asked for your zip code and you are not a constituent

If you are a constituent

If you are asked for your zip code and you are not a constituent, where s/he is making decisions that affect me directly, and I'd like my message passed along though I am not a constituent.""

**II.  Call your own reps.**  [Here's the link to find their contact information.](http://www.usa.gov/Contact/Elected.shtml)  Use the data above to let them know you're familiar with their voting record and it will be influencing your vote.  Again



**III.  Reach out to friends and family and get them to call.**  

This is the second most important thing you can do.  Especially family that are in the districts of high priority contacts.  For every person you convince to call, quadrupling) your impact.

Every step you help them take increases the probability they will call.

Looking up their reps for them and sending them the phone numbers probably doubles the chances they'll call.

Explaining the situation

**IV.  Share this post or something like it.**

I don't care how you do this.  The spreadsheet is public domain.  This post is public domain (within whatever terms Reddit imposes in their agreement) as far as I'm concerned.  Copy it, Twitter, Carrier Pigeon, Pack Mule, etc.) so others can have access to it and will be encouraged to contact their friends and loved ones as well.

CISPA would allow the government to use collected private information for reasons other than cybersecurity. The government could use any information it receives for “any lawful purpose” besides “regulatory purposes

CISPA would give Internet Service Providers free rein to monitor the private communications and activities of users on their networks. ISPs would have wide latitude to do anything that can be construed as part of a “cybersecurity system

CISPA would empower the military and the National Security Agency (NSA) to collect information about domestic Internet users. Other information sharing bills would direct private information from domestic sources to civilian agencies, about users and systems inside the United States.

CISPA places too much faith in private companies, private companies have few clear incentives to resist such pressure. There is also no requirement that companies ever tell their customers what they have shared with the government, either before or after the fact. As informed consumers, Americans expect technology companies to have clear privacy policies, telling us exactly how and when the company will use and share our personal data, so that we can make informed choices about which companies have earned our trust and deserve our business.

I love you guys with every shred of my hard-left leaning heart. But I think you might be doing something wrong. Here is one thing that can help you. 

Tomorrow

Seriously. polos and khakis. Every time you guys DO finally get some fucking press, Polo shirt and Khakis. 

Why? Because you need to get the right-leaning equivalent of me on your side. I'm 35 right now. I understand where the hippy thing comes from. I get it as well as a guy who's 35 can. My Counterparts do not. They think you are scummy druggies on welfare and when they see on tv a bunch of people who they think are S.D's on W

Speaking of the cops, it's fucking cop camouflage. And if they DO come for you. When people at home see** PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE THEM** getting abused by police... That's when shit changes. 

**Seeing protesters get beat up means nothing because protesters get beat up all the time. Therefore

So for serious. Do it. You're almost about to tip this thing over. Polos and khakis. Cop Camo + target audience = Shave

TL;DR: Polo shirt and Khakis = dress code for nyc protests tomorrow.

Do it.

Edit: Going to bed soon

Please spread this as much as you can. Professionalism will help push this thing over the edge. You have labor pushing you. National Media is starting to wake up to you. You're almost there. Keep pushing.

Think: Business Casual Friday. Don't play it up like the Billionaires for healthcare. You're just a guy

Even if you don't think that you SHOULD be judged on appearances (which I do agree)

Do it.",,t5_2cneq,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/kw3fx/to_all_occupy_wall_street_participants_here_is/

So together we've been organizing meetings with Senators in their home districts. The Senate's in recess until the 23rd

Here's the problem: the following Senate offices are ignoring our requests for meetings before the 24th. It's not just that the senators are busy; we're asking for meetings with staffers too.

Redditors! Can you call the offices below and ask them to meet with us?  Even if your state isn't on this list

FOR YOUR STATE: Introduce yourself, before the cloture vote on the 24th (FYI, ""cloture"" is a motion to limit debate and push PIPA to a vote, clearing the way for SOPA).   

Urge the senator to vote against cloture on the 24th

NOTE: there's some chance they've already granted meetings to individuals who aren't part of our process

**UPDATE:** We're getting their attention! KEEP IT UP! [Sign up here] (http://americancensorship.org/) for notifications about meetings in your state.

Romney went way
&gt;
&gt;For fiscal year 2010, Congress has budgeted $445 million for CPB. That’s less than 1% of the budget. Way less. It’s about 1/100th of a 1%.
&gt;

These 99 senators need more calls (took Wyden off the list because he is [amazing](http://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/blog/post/wyden-on-cyber-security-privacy-should-be-the-default-not-the-exception)).

The College Republicans, and encouraged, to invite speakers who represent diverse, and sometimes unpopular, points of view, in keeping with the canons of academic freedom. Accordingly, the University will not block the College Republicans from hosting their speaker of choice on campus.


**To say that I am disappointed with the judgment and maturity of the College Republicans, but Ms. Coulter is not among them. Her rhetoric is often hateful and needlessly provocative—more heat than light—and her message is aimed squarely at the darker side of our nature.**

As members of a Jesuit institution, I told the University community that I hold out great contempt for anyone who would intentionally inflict pain on another human being because of their race, gender, sexual orientation, or creed.

“Disgust”was the word I used to sum up my feelings about those incidents. Hate speech

Still, and I fully expect our students, faculty, alumni, parents, and staff to voice their opposition, civilly and respectfully

The College Republicans have unwittingly provided Fordham with a test of its character: do we abandon our ideals in the face of repugnant speech and seek to stifle Ms. Coulter’s (and the student organizers’) opinions, and in the power of decency and reason to overcome hatred and prejudice.

1. I propose removing Reddit from our AdBlock exceptions list on May 1^st. This will continue until Reddit Inc. decides to join us in opposing Cispa.

2. Also beginning on May 1

3. A week long boycott going through May 14 until May 21. Seven days of redditors not using Reddit.

If they join us on or before May 14^th we will not need to do the boycott. If they join *any time* after May 14

So

Edit: Changed the date to May 14 so that /r/FIA will not endangered by the blackout. My bad.

Edit 2: [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/swu9t/looking_for_admin_support_against_cispa_in_the/) is a link to a thread for the admins. Give it some publicity

Edit 3: Along with AdBlocking

Edit 4: [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/evolutionReddit/comments/swgyt/cybersecurity_round_two_reddit_hivemind_vs_us/) is a link to some other great web activism. We don't have to stop at CISPA.

Edit 5: Okay, and make phone calls to their representatives it would be much more effective at mitigating future bills that negatively affect us. Can someone write up an example/template so that we can send these letters en masse?

Edit 6: [Awesome Infographic](http://i.imgur.com/ga3Pb.jpg) that gives some explanation of CISPA vs. SOPA.

Edit 7: Making requests for the FBI to send you all the information they have on you? Might be a good heads up to see some of the types of information that entities will be able to share with each other. A few thousand requests should be a pretty clear heads-up. [Link](http://getmyfbifile.com/) to info about getting your FBI file. (Better idea? Let me know!)

**Serious** Edit: Alright, so you can all make these accounts)

No use of your normal username, only ANTICISPA accounts for the people who still want to make an impact). Can I get some feedback?

An honest thank you to POTATO_IN_MY_ANUS for this **seriously** brilliant suggestion =)

**To the administrators** I am making a request for *two* things:

1. If the admins 'absolutely cannot, so that users can be informed, motivated, and encouraged to take action on their own. Using the blog post to effectively spread the word across the entire site will show the users just how much of an impact CISPA has on all American internet users.

2. Have the admins explicitly state that while CISPA does not really affect reddit INC all that much, to explain to users that they need to advocate for themselves and how they can do it.

Thank you to SwampySoccerField for this great idea in communicating with the admins.

I am not trying to make this an anti-Reddit campaign. You allow us to communicate very effectively, show us that you are listening. Show us that you are trying to do *something* that can benefit (hopefully with some good, politically motivated action) everyone.

PRESS RELEASE

Over a century ago Thomas Edison got the patent for a device which would ""do for the eye what the phonograph does for
the ear"". He called it the Kinetoscope. He was not only amongst the first to record video
to own the copyright to a motion picture.

Because of Edisons patents for the motion pictures it was close to financially impossible to create motion pictures
in the North american east coast. The movie studios therefor relocated to California
Hollywood. The reason was mostly because there was no patent.
There was also no copyright to speak of
Fantasia

So, is that they
circumvented immaterial rights. They copied (or put in their terminology: ""stole"") other peoples creative works
without paying for it. They did it in order to make a huge profit. Today
studios are on the Fortune 500 list of the richest companies in the world. Congratulations - it's all based on being
able to re-use other peoples creative works. And today they hold the rights to what other people create.
If you want to get something released
other peoples rules.

The reason they are always complainting about ""pirates"" today is simple. We've done what they did. We circumvented the
rules they created and created our own. We crushed their monopoly by giving people something more efficient. We allow
people to have direct communication between eachother
over 107% of the profits (yes
It's all based on the fact that we're competition.
We've proven that their existance in their current form is no longer needed. We're just better than they are.

And the funny part is that our rules are very similar to the founding ideas of the USA. We fight for freedom of speech.
We see all people as equal. We believe that the public
should be created to serve the public

The Pirate Bay is truly an international community. The team is spread all over the globe - but we've stayed out of the
USA. We have Swedish roots and a swedish friend said this:
The word SOPA means ""trash"" in Swedish. The word PIPA means ""a pipe"" in Swedish. This is of course not a coincidence.
They want to make the internet inte a one way pipe
rest of us obedient consumers. 
The public opinion on this matter is clear. Ask anyone on the street and you'll learn that noone wants to be fed with
trash. Why the US government want the american people to be fed with trash is beyond our imagination but we hope that
you will stop them

SOPA can't do anything to stop TPB. Worst case we'll change top level domain from our current .org to one of the
hundreds of other names that we already also use. In countries where TPB is blocked
mind
To fix the ""problem of piracy"" one should go to the source of the problem. The entertainment industry say they're
creating ""culture"" but what they really do is stuff like selling overpriced plushy dolls and making 11 year old girls
become anorexic. Either from working in the factories that creates the dolls for basically no salary or by watching
movies and tv shows that make them think that they're fat.

In the great Sid Meiers computer game Civilization you can build Wonders of the world. One of the most powerful ones
is Hollywood. With that you control all culture and media in the world. Rupert Murdoch was happy with MySpace and had
no problems with their own piracy until it failed. Now he's complainting that Google is the biggest source of piracy
in the world - because he's jealous. He wants to retain his mind control over people and clearly you'd get a more
honest view of things on Wikipedia and Google than on Fox News.

Some facts (years
when Wikipedia is blacked out. Because of pressure from our failing competitors. We're sorry for that.

A line buried deep in the document also ominously states
The change would eliminate a 1985 law forcing companies bidding on federal contracts to pay “fair wages and overtime.""

Opposition New Democratic Party MP Pat Martin called the proposal a “solution without a problem.”

“The only conclusion I can come up with is that it's a war on labor and the left. It's what the Americans did with the right-to-work states and the end result is $8 or $9 an hour is now the average wage in places like North Carolina

The bill will also overhaul the country’s immigration rules

I am 35 years old

If there's enough interest, and schedule an emergency CenTex meetup for the purpose of gathering signatures and planning the campaign. The weather is a bit miserable, so the turnout might be poor, but #OccupyAustin could also be a source of last-minute signatures.

I welcome comments and suggestions, canvassing for signatures, and creating a position statement.

Edit: It's 11:30pm, but let's be honest: this idea is less than six hours old, and there are an amazing number of signatures to get before Monday.  You'll notice I haven't included my name or identifying info -- I don't want the harassment that comes with this if there's not enough support to get us over even the first hurdle.  We'd need more signatures than we've gotten upvotes, and upvotes aren't restricted to Texas's 21st district.  If anyone's interested in a CenTex meetup for organization on Saturday afternoon, we can give it a shot, and we can hit #OWS for some signatures.  Realistically though, the scale of this project may be a bit too much for us for this weekend.  

IF WE CAN'T MAKE IT: Support your local independent parties.  Call your representatives.  Make yourselves heard.  Run for office yourself -- but don't wait for a reddit post four days before signatures are due.  That doesn't work

If you're an #OWS person: Occupy Congress.  If you're a Republican or a Democrat who feels your party has gone off the deep end

We've got less than a year until the 2012 elections.  Let's have some people to vote FOR instead of a plethora of people to vote AGAINST.

Last edit: Apparently I missed the deadline by a DAY.

EDIT 2: My friend was at the protests and forwarded me this link to a petition.  Its just one small way we can make our voices heard beyond this page: [http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/uc_berkeley_teachers_condemn_violence/](http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/uc_berkeley_teachers_condemn_violence/) (Im not sure if this petition is supposed to be Cal students and faculty only

EDIT 3: Thanks for the thoughtful discussion everyone! Its nearing my bedtime, so I can say I conquered Reddit.  

A lot of people have made posts asking or hoping that we can come to conclusions or something.  I can't say this represents everyone here

We demand a law, but dictates that during a non-violent protest, certain laws, such as curfew, blocking traffic or causing noise disturbances can be overlooked.  The logic is this: our laws are in place to protect the citizens.  But if a large enough group of the citizens are peacefully breaking a law to make a protest about a bigger point, then the Police protecting them directly should be more important than protecting them indirectly, by enforcing the minor law bring broken.

*January 9

*WASHINGTON - Wisconsin’s First District Congressman Paul Ryan released the following statement regarding H.R. 3261

*""The internet is one of the most magnificent expressions of freedom and free enterprise in history. It should stay that way. While H.R. 3261, I believe it creates the precedent and possibility for undue regulation, censorship and legal abuse. I do not support H.R. 3261 in its current form and will oppose the legislation should it come before the full House.""*

This is an extraordinary victory. Reddit was able to force the House Budget Chair to reverse course - shock waves will be felt throughout the establishment in Washington today - other lawmakers will take notice. 

We still have much work to do. I encourage you to continuously pressure pro-SOPA/PIPA legislators and remain vigilant

The coverup is what we should save our real vitriol for.  I know some of you will immediately dismiss this as you view everyone in the military as inherently evil.  I find that silly.  (There are also people who think I can do no wrong because I AM and I find that dangerous).  Give it a read anyway.  


War is an ugly, potential, and especially lives.  What's in this video is distasteful to say the least, but it's also intentionally inflammatory (presumably so WL gets more clicks, and we all obliged them).  This video is from a period of increasing, and increasingly violent, action by insurgents.  Mortar and rocket attacks, executions in the most grotesque manner


The men you hear are reacting to stress from a variety of sources: lack of sleep because of indirect fire attacks, from being away from home and family.  In all that stress, they still behaved according to the rules of engagement.  They positively identified small arms (which are a threat) and misidentified an RPG.  Had I not known, I would also have called out RPG.  It unfortunately looks like it, and that was amplified by the pose he took.  WL added in captions to let you know there were cameras to amplify outrage, but having flown around Baghdad in helos *everything* looks like a threat after they shoot at you.


Shooting the van was also justifiable because the ""insurgents"" were going to collect their wounded and weapons.  Clearly the aircrew were wrong, and did so efficiently.  Further, the initial statements that said they were engaged with a violent group also does not strike me as ""cover up.""  If you've ever been involved with an emergency situation you know the first reports out are **usually** wrong.  The later reports, however, I find repugnant.  Events like this make me want to **stay** in the military because I don't want the bastards trying to cover up what was a horrific mistake thinking I won't be right over their shoulder next time.

I have found virtually all the military members I was with in Iraq serious, from fathers, older brothers, cousins that know kids like that back home.  The amount of work we did to keep civilians out of harms way was breathtaking sometimes because it put us in much more vulnerable situations.  I'm good with that.  I signed up, they didn't.  As for the attitude and demeanor of the aircrew, yep, it's stomach-turning.  I did see this on occasion, and like those guys I feel awful about it when I reflect.

I do believe that you should sign the petition that I have mentioned to jam up all channels and make sure that congress does not have any choice but to see that this issue will not be lost in the mix. The amendment that _zardoz_ posted is by design far more professional and seems to be taking the issue in a more serious tone.

Also, from religious to atheist, etc. it is the medium with which we can connect and unite on issues such as these. By coming together and signing petitions, adding support to bills and sending letters to our representatives, we remind our representatives that we are still out there and we want to control the discourse of the debate. When this many people agree in whole or in part on one issue it sends a message that we are paying attention. If you do not believe that this is a significant manifestation of the power of the people, I urge you to use reddit and other sources to organize rallies or protests or whatever you think may work. When millions of people unite without any leadership from the ruling class, we have the power and they can't help but address the issues at hand. Case in point, letters and signed petitions.
