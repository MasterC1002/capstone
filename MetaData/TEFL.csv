1368305159.0,1e5apb,How to make a career out of TEFL (and get paid doing it).,chinadonkey,95,12,40,"I've seen quite a few posts here regarding making a career out of TEFL and getting to a place where you're making more than ""pretty good considering the cost of living"" money. I've spent the better part of this past year trying to figure that out myself. Luckily

Most of the jobs listed here require *at least* 1-3 years of teaching experience and a recognized TEFL certification. Some of them are very hard (or impossible) to get into without post-graduate work. If you're fresh out of college and need to start paying back your student loans

Also, people can and will often be paid differently for doing the same job at the same company, so make sure you're negotiating your salary. There's money out there to be made.

**IELTS** Test proctoring can be quite lucrative side work. Invigilating (which involves you making sure students don't cheat and assisting with instructions) pays $20 an hour to stand around and be bored for a while. It's boring, see if they need help conducting tests. You can get paid similarly well for conducting TOEIC and TOEFL tests. 

Being an IELTS examiner (conducting speaking tests and marking papers) is where the real money's to be made

**EAP/AEP Teaching** This is what I do now. Basically

There's been an explosion of schools opening up

The problem with these programs is that your employment is subject to the whims of student enrollment, which could put your job at risk. EAP programs attached to universities are generally the most secure as they can grant admittance to the university without an IELTS score and thus attract a larger student base.

**Academic Management** This can be quite lucrative, blond girl your boss forced on you who calls in hungover every weekend. Stuff like that.

Still

I'd recommend getting on with a big chain with clearly defined career paths into management. Smaller schools will pay less and have a lower career ceiling.

**TEFL Training** It's hard work running an intensive TEFL program, either. Some CELTA trainers change schools frequently, even sometimes on a month-to-month basis. It's a long-term gig for others. You can teach in the US or at centers abroad. I saw a job ad here for a CELTA trainer that paid $38k-$42k a year, but that's definitely entry level.

**The Middle East** This is where people go to earn their retirement money. Pay starts at $40k a year and goes up depending on the country. The better jobs generally require either a boatload of experience, for a variety of reasons.

**International Schools** Have a teaching license or a mind-splodingly awesome resume? Do not pass go, but you generally need a teaching license in your home state in a subject they teach. Just being a good TEFL teacher isn't good enough.

   I remembered that a few days ago when you were giving us a class on Monday.You told us an
experience of yours. you said that once you were riding bicycle on the road but unfortunately the bike was broken and you fell on the ground. You feel very helpless because you are alone here. I am very sorry to hear that .As your student who also comes from a place which is far away from here 
   Today is Thanksgiving Day.So I want to take this opportunity to show my thankfulness to you.Thank you for teaching me a lot of things about American culture.I’ve reaped so much joy of speaking English.I’m looking forward to meetng you at next class and my best wishes for you!

Other names for his school may be Daniel English, or 다니엘학원. It is owned by, probably, one of the most self-absorbed, arrogant, and abusive bosses in Korea. Lee Beom Seok (이범석). 

I worked for him for 4.5 months

While working for him, and no paystub. On Tuesday and Thursday, I traveled 4 hours round trip and never received the promised compensation for my travel. I am also unsure if my taxes were paid. My work week totaled well over 50 hours per week.

I risked deportation working for him

He also doesn't give an end of contract bonus and didn't pay employees promised bonuses for extra work. 

He continually harassed me and other teachers about our teaching ability. 

I decided to end my employment with him when, on pay day that he wouldn't pay me for the entire month of July for a completely bogus reason. After that he convinced another employee to go home without a bonus, and decided he could, once again, pay me. 


When I first received the details of my job it told me I would be working for ""Korea Afterschool Academy of Continuing Education"" at Seonghwan Public Elementary. When I checked what contract I was working under at Immigration

So how did I find this job? Through a shady recruiter named “GNBgate” The two recruiters that work for GNBgate are Katie Kim and Bryan Choi. I would encourage anyone to not contract through them as they placed 3 foreign teachers with this awful hagwon. I repeatedly e-mailed Katie Kim about finding me a new job and she ignored all of my e-mails

When I first agreed to the contract that Katie Kim offered, she told me the job fell through and that I would have to work in Cheonan instead. 

So in conclusion

Once again his name is Lee Beom Seok (이범석) 
The possible names he operates under after: 
Daniel English 
Daniel Hagwon 
Daniel Learning Center 
Daniel Language Center

As an American, France, and Italy but those are all fairly special circumstances (special programs, they have higher degrees, etc).  

The Czech Republic is a popular place to start as it has top notch TEFL courses and a huge expat population.  However

Slovakia and Poland on the other hand are both possibilities.  Poland has a special agreement with the United States so the 90 days in 90 days out nightmare of Schengen doesn't apply (seriously).  That agreement is ONLY good for Poland and Americans though, but smaller cities like Gdansk, Poznan, Katowice, and even a bigger city like Warsaw have plenty of opportunities. 

If you look outside of the EU there are also some options.  Turkey needs teachers badly.  There are loads of Americans

There is also a great program in Georgia to get some experience.  You get to stay with a family and learn al about an extremely interesting country (with amazing god damn food).  http://www.tlg.gov.ge/

Bosnia is also a possibility

There are several countries that are completely off the table like Hungary (you have to pay to be placed in a program there) and Bulgaria.

1375166220.0,1jc173,Farewell fuckers..,captainenema,55,25,29,"I've been modding /r/tefl for over a year now and it's my opinion I needed to step aside for someone more willing to put real effort into it.

It's been interesting to watch the community grow. It started out with just under 1000 posters and ended up with over 5000. 

Been some great discussions among the sewer tank of noob posts. Which to be fair.. noob posts are to be expected and should be encouraged as they are the bread and butter of /r/tefl. I'm just not the right person to moderate it anymore as my patience for it went out the window awhile ago.

I've been considering founding a new subreddit for long term esl teachers.. a nice quiet neck of the internet where we can talk shit

As a parting thought for /r/tefl:

This subreddit is neutral territory. That doesn't mean we should all be nice to each other or not ask difficult questions of each other. The tough questions are encouraged as the quest for truth is a vital one for an industry that is for the most part entirely unregulated and changing each and every year.

When I started teaching in 2005ish, and people who had their celta were respected.

Maybe not in Asia

Now the market is flooded with the TEFL course providers. You can find perfectly acceptable alternatives to the CELTA. The exceptional became the common and that also seems to be changing. 

I'm not trying to get into one of my famous anti-celta tirades, losers, and to some extent I think we are starting to gentrify as a family. 

/R/-telf needs to be the sort of place where hard questions can be asked and debated. /r/tefl needs to be free of commercial interests and this is why I looked at that footprints thread with a bit of dismay. I would much rather of had that IaMa go down in a different subreddit. 

/r/tefl needs to be the kind of place where the big names can be exposed when they are screwing over teachers. /r/tefl needs to be the kind of place where that information can be kept and the various schools and so forth be told to fuck off when they want it deleted. Mind you that's not to say it needs to be a forum for slander and other bollocks

When you got mr. school owner man (read this as Mr. English First Owner) dry humping your leg looking at you with big doe eyes of lust and you are praying he's going to lube you up before the inevitable anal pillaging

Let this be the sort of place where good advice about real problems can be found. Don't let it become a fan forum for schools

In short, minus the pretentious assclowns that make up the bulk of the dave's posting ranks.  That's my opinion, good luck, god bless, I'm gonna go back to sippin' liquor on my afternoon off. 

btw.. can someone unban /u/beakersful? He pissed me off and I banned him and forgot to unban the poor sod. My bad bro

It's still useful and I haven't seen it mentioned here at any real length.

**What is LinkedIn?**

It's a social networking site like Facebook with a focus on professionals. You put up your credentials and experience and colleagues endorse your work. It's a very good way to get in front of headhunters and recruiters

**How do I set up a LinkedIn profile?**

Follow the simple step-by-step instructions which millions of other people have managed to do.

**How do I tailor my LinkedIn profile for teaching positions?**

Bingo - *that's* a good question. That is what we're here for.

We're going to work off of [my LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/renatoganoza) because it's convenient. I'm going to be posting [imgur links](http://imgur.com/a/8SrRB#0) to screenshots from my profile throughout this write-up. We'll go section-by-section from the top.

A. Your Picture

It's always safest to go with something formal or semi-formal for your picture. Wear a jacket if you're a guy. If you don't have a jacket

Anyway, make that sound as nice as possible and make sure the rest of your profile is on-point.

B. Summary. [Example](http://imgur.com/a/8SrRB#1)

This is where you outline either your goals or your accomplishments in an ""elevator pitch."" What are you proud of? Try to sum yourself up in a few words so that people know who they're dealing with.

C. ""Recent"" Experience. [Example](http://imgur.com/a/8SrRB#2)

You want to be a bit top-heavy with your experience: put the most effort into describing your work at your current or most recent position. People want to know what you've done recently.

Things to keep in mind here:

Most people won't read way down on your profile. If you want to highlight a skill

It's a good idea to try to demonstrate growth and separate skill sets. Don't keep repeating the same phrases on every entry: no one wants to parse all that. ""Easier"" skills should go on past positions and harder or more impressive ones should be highlighted in recent ones.

Also - you see that ""People Also Viewed"" column on the right there? Those people are getting clicks on their profiles. They must be doing something right

D. ""Past"" Experience. [Example](http://imgur.com/a/8SrRB#3)

I went a bit too minimalist here

If you've held a position for any length of time, and the last from someone I reported to. The three recommendations all reference different skills I brought to play, and balance each other nicely.

(You can request recommendations from other users

E. Education and Languages. [Example](http://imgur.com/a/8SrRB#4)

If you've got a great track record at school

F. Skills &amp; Expertise. [Example](http://imgur.com/a/8SrRB#5)

This is a recent addition to LinkedIn and one that I'm not wildly fond of

Anyway

G. Recommendations. [Example](http://imgur.com/a/8SrRB#6)

Again

F. Groups. [Example](http://imgur.com/a/8SrRB#7)

I don't follow any groups closely. They're barely moderated and most are full of vapid ""I'm looking for a job!"" posts with zero responses. You *can* increase your visibility to recruiters by participating in group discussions

Make sure you unsubscribe from group digest e-mails if you don't want your inbox blown up regularly.

**So I have a basic profile up with a picture of me in a bowtie. What do I do now?**

Reach out to people. LinkedIn isn't useful with zero or few contacts or with bad contacts.

LinkedIn will offer to scour your e-mail contacts to see whether or not you've got friends on the network. You can let it do so or not. If none of your friends are on LinkedIn or they aren't in industries you're interested in, you seem like a really knowledgeable person. I'd like to keep in touch!"" or ""Hi - I saw your post in (group) and I'm trying to break into Indonesia myself. Can you point me towards any good employers?""

You'll get at least a couple bites and you'll start to grow a network.

**Why should I bother?**

You can spend two hours today setting up a beautiful LinkedIn profile and get no bites or job offers. I get a few connection requests and job offers a week through LinkedIn, but you'd be missing out on all that if you weren't ""out there.""

Imagine that LinkedIn is an information stream. There's an upside to being plugged into it

If you're still not convinced

- Haggle for a better salary.

- Research the credentials I'd need for a promotion. I looked at a few contacts who held the position I wanted and jotted down their credentials. Doing that five or six times will tell you what you *really* need for a job (which isn't always what is outlined on the ""Help Wanted"" ads!)

- Hire teachers. I've hired teachers who've contacted me on LinkedIn

- Get a feel for new cities and markets from professionals with similar backgrounds and interests

**Anything else?**

Shoot me a message here or on LinkedIn if you've just set up a profile (or have a profile) and want some feedback. Send me a connection request if you want

Feel free to rip my profile apart or to use bits and pieces of it to make up your own.

First

Last year I taught English in South Korea to children aged 4-13. I went into the job with an English degree, which had to do with a combination of things: my demeanor, communication style, and leniency, as well as the attitude of the parents and the school administration. Things didn't seem to improve very much over those 12 months.

Now my fiance and I are looking for a job in Europe or Japan, I currently do not have the cash to blow on an on-site TEFL course.

Reddit

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks guys! 

Update: Wow, and I think because of that many of the parents weren't terribly invested in their kids' progress. I rarely got feedback from the parents via my Korean co-teachers, despite whatever I had written in their kids' report cards. 

Still, and because he established class rules and upheld them consistently. I tend to over-analyze things, second-guess myself a lot, and get stressed very easily, which probably made me a very confusing teacher to have!

""I wonder how it would feel to fuck a baby?""

""You ever stab a dog?""

After he passed out it would have been fine 'cept he kept waking up raving fucking mad to the point he was scaring the shit out of everyone. 

Personally

Finally he settles down enough to let everyone get a few hours of shut eye before arriving in Beijing only to be left on the fucking train by yours truly when I decided that such a charming bloke needed his sleep.

1373233598.0,1hto15,So you're considering teaching abroad. Start here.,peruisay,23,0,2,"There's no one-size-fits-all here

**Are you a licensed teacher in your home country?**

Great! You might want to look at international schools

Note that a lot of schools have ""International"" somewhere in their names purely as a marketing gesture. One option for finding ""better"" schools is Googling as if you were a parent in your target city: ""[Shanghai International Baccalaureate](https://www.google.com/search?q=shanghai+international+baccalaureate)"" is a fine place to start as far as that goes.

International schools will largely be found in provincial and national capitals or posh suburbs. If you're looking for a more ""exotic"" experience or have a very specific location in mind

**Are you a college or high school student?**

Do you have any teaching experience? If you don't, the smoother your experience will be.

So how do you get experience? Lots of ways. See whether or not your school's math or writing labs are hiring tutors. Browse jobs boards for private tutoring gigs in your area. Volunteer with local charities or churches that work with immigrants or reach out to the international students around you and set up language exchanges. Get a summer or winter job as a camp counselor. If you're already working somewhere

If you can't do *any one of those things* for whatever reason

**Not a career teacher

Schools (obviously) prefer candidates with education or English degrees. That said, make sure to note that.

(If you haven't done either

**What do you want?**

People teach abroad for all sorts of reasons and one isn't necessarily any more valid than the others. The above sections were basically just making sure that people in different situations are taking steps that will help make them competitive candidates for TEFL jobs.

Now

*""I want adventure. I want out. I don't see this as a long-term thing.""*

I can relate. Make sure your resume is free of typos and that you have some experience you can play up in interviews. If you aren't specific on a location, and what local laws and regulations should you taken careful note of? Do you need to take any safety precautions? How much money should you bring?

It is important to note here that moving somewhere exotic doesn't guarantee you'll have an adventure

*""I want to travel.""*

Same as above, or plane connections. Also try to take purchasing power into account - it's a lot easier to work in Korea and vacation in China than it is to work in China and vacation in Korea, for example.

*""I want to help people. I want to make a difference.""*

You have to be more specific. Which people

If you want to help people *by teaching English*, and ask co-workers and supervisors for feedback. Pursue additional credentials and qualifications.

If that isn't exactly what you had in mind

*""The job market is lousy back home. I just want to earn a living.""*

You'll have an easier time adjusting to more-Westernized national capitals and large cities. Places you've heard of. You'll run into more expats in bigger cities

You'll probably have to make compromises somewhere. What are your ""must-haves""? Do you need a specific level of income to be able to save such and such to pay off your student loans? Do you refuse to use a squat toilet? Is having an oven important to you? Do you need your coffee first thing in the morning to think straight?

Read through the past five or ten pages or fifteen pages of /r/tefl and just read up on different people's experiences. Run searches. If something seems particularly appealing or suited to your situation

*""I want to make money. I want to save money.""*

Your ability to earn money as a TEFL teacher is pretty closely tied to your credentials (which ""unlocks"" more competitive and better-paid markets)

Again

**If you don't feel that your situation was covered above or you have something to add

And

You go to that nifty sidebar on the right and start looking through job listings. Apply to jobs you're interested in and that you're qualified for. Interview. Look over the contract. If you accept a job and aren't satisfied with the conditions ""on the ground""

1. The website is terrible.  Lots of broken links.
2. Teacher certification is only required by accredited schools, pass a state test, and then *maybe* you would be eligible to apply, depending on the certification rules for your state.  Many states now only offer ""provisional"" certification to recent graduates.
3. This program is only considered a ""route to certification""

If you want to be certified

tl;dr: Don't believe everything you read on the internet.

Edit: This is bugging me, *does not require teacher certification in your home country*.  Think about it.  That's stupid.  Nobody would do that.

* First of all, a clean record and be a native speaker because it made it a lot easier to make friends since we all had at least those things in common - though the glaring homogeneity of the TEFL set made it a bit boring. 
* I'm a brown girl. In Korea, the brownness has been a slight disadvantage job-wise, but generally, the people I meet have been much more accepting. And there seems to be much more gender equality in China. (Thanks Communism!)
* Personally, listening, and speaking practice all happened in the same class, whereas in China, they just want you to teach ""oral English."" It seems to me that they think that if they stick a foreigner in a class with a bunch of kids for an hour a week, those kids are just going to magically start speaking English. I understand that kids in China don't actually write or read until elementary school, but there really has to be a better way.
* China: TA's and parents in the classroom. Fucking terrible. The parents just distract the kids and tell them the answers. The TA's just translate everything I say. Why did they even hire me?
* Chinese parents are much nicer to their kids than Korean parents (ie. none of my kids have come to class covered in bruises yet)

I've been searching around Reddit and the internet and have found some great information

I'm about to finish up a BS in computer science, but I really think I am only who I am today because I've had some amazing teachers in highschool and college.  So, part of me wants to give teaching a shot - both for myself, and as a way to pay forward everything my previous teachers have done for me.

One possibility that has interested me is teaching in Japan.  I'm a native speaker of English, but I plan on continuing to work at it until I'm fluent.  I've researched and took a class on Japanese culture, and Japan really seems like a nice place to try living.

From what I've researched

* The JET program - they handle everything (and even interview you at an embassy or consulate in your country)

* Teaching at a conversation school - you get more control over your location

There's a couple things I wasn't able to figure out though

* If I do go, probably at either a high school or university.  What qualifications do you need for that?  For example, my highschool growing up only hired teachers with at least a BS specifically in teaching, and a master's in some other field.  My university requires all professors to have a PhD.

* How is the adult education infrastructure in Japan - i.e.

* It looks like there's a ton of different certificate programs for teaching ESL.  Do you know if any of these actually mean anything?  e.g. in software

* Somewhat unrelated

* Any other thoughts or stories from your experiences teaching in Japan?  What do you think the best way to get started is?

I fell in love with education and have since made it my career path.

2. Legal and Immigration - Country pages go here, legalities, and realities associated with specific regions.  An article on the challenges of working in Saudi Arabia for teachers used to the social permissiveness of Korea would go here.
3. Jobs - Interviewing, certificate courses (TEFL/CELTA/etc), and things related to the business end of ESL.  An article about how to market yourself as an F-4 Private tutor in Korea would go here.

Of course, you won't see these categories.  An article on the grammar translation method would undoubtedly mention that it is used a lot in Korea, which would lead to the Korea country page, which would lead to pages with immigration and a hagwon blacklist, etc.

1375885283.0,1jvue4,One of my favourite resources to make puzzles: Make my snake [OC],insertfunnyusername,14,2,3,"This was something I started making for my classes ages ago. I haven’t made one for ages but I remembered it this afternoon and thought I would share it with you guys. It was an idea I came up with based on other puzzles I've seen. A friend I showed it to made his own software to do it. 


**Background**


Class full of young learners about 8-10 years old. We had been doing the simple past recently. We had done ‘to be’ and had just finished regular verbs. This was a review of that. The Kelly in the story was my TA who I used to lightly tease in class. She always found it funny and it make the class laugh. They are also obsessed about if she has a boyfriend.  


Although this was YL I think it could be used with any level or age group


**What is it?**


It’s kind of like a word search


**Huh?**


Ok
Two things are created (usually in a web browser). You will get the puzzle sheet like [this](http://i.imgur.com/XJwqTrV.jpg) as well as the answer sheet like [this](http://i.imgur.com/y0Gnazv.jpg). If you don’t like the way it comes out then just keep hitting the make button until you get one you are happy with. 


**What’s going on here?**


The puzzle always starts in the top left corner. It writes out the sentences often changing direction. Students need to try and follow the sentences to the end. I usually make it a bit clearer where the start and end are by adding something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/jcUyLhs.jpg) and telling them they need to follow it till they finish at the smiley face. They need a lot of support the first time sometimes. And you should do the first sentence or 2 together to make sure everyone's got it.


I usually get them into small teams of 3 or 4 and get them to work together. They can also share their work with other groups. This makes it easier as well as more communicative and fun. Having them use highlighter pends is usually a good idea. I’ll usually make it into a bigger worksheet by making something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/uovhzSQ.jpg).


**Why is this good activity?**


I’ve had so many success stories with this. The one that most sticks in my mind was when it was a story with a load of different tenses. They had got through half of it but the entire class was stuck on one part, they did and I just gave them that ‘Come on, think about it’ smile teachers use. One of them suddenly screams “YESTERDAY!!!! YESTERDAY!!!!” and shows all her group the answer she found. Suddenly all the class has worked it out and powering on through the puzzle. 


I've used this puzzle for loads of other things as well. Most tenses, I like/he likes… the list is endless. It seem in English we often tack extra bits on the end of words or have one word directly influence the next one.

1374818909.0,1j2yws,[Modpost] Caveat emptor: be smart about using recruiters,chinadonkey,16,4,18,"Recruiters are one way to secure employment in a foreign country (they're quite popular in Korea)

* How much are you paid by the companies you work with for recruiting teachers?

* What kind of support do you offer teachers once they're in-country? What happens if they have a problem with their school?

* How can you be sure that your salary is the same as the salary of a teacher with similar qualifications who did not go through a recruiter?

The fact that the OP left (got off work?) once the questions were more than job inquiries is troubling. [This poster](http://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/comments/1j1nb4/i_am_a_recruiter_for_international_teaching_jobs/cbahvs9) worked with footprints and had a mixed experience (he didn't find a job through them).

This post is an advisory to anyone considering contacting footprints recruiting based on their IAMA. Trying to find some new teachers by way of a quasi-informative IAMA is awkward at best and seedy at the worst.

Googling schools in places where I want to work is generally my preferred way of finding employment, second, third or sixth job offer until you find something that feels right. Make sure they're up front about what kind of commission they make from the school and what affect it has on your salary. Contact current teachers at the schools they send and look for red flags in their responses. Also, don't use a recruiter if you're going to China; they're some of the worst people I've ever met. As in, steal your whole monthly salary and dis-a-fucking-pear into the ether.

1374526477.0,1iu6g5,Just put in my 2 weeks notice; what a rush! Do I need a CELTA? Am I crazy not having a final destination country picked out? (xpost from /r/IWantOut),Trent_Alkaline,14,3,18,"Well

A little background: I'm 28 years old, I hold a bachelors degree of English, I have no debt, and I have a decent nest egg in my savings (enough to last without employment roughly a year abroad in SE Asia or other ""cheap"" countries + return airfare and a deposit on an apartment back in the USA if needed). I also have a family that is supportive enough that if shit goes truly pear shaped, I can always crash with a relative for a while until I find sea-legs again.

I chose English as my major in university back in 2004 with the dream of teaching abroad. I'm not sure where that dream went awry, white picket fence, dog running in the yard, a fancy car, etc. Yeah. I'm finding zero satisfaction in that endless consumer chase and it's time to rekindle that dream of travelling and supporting myself on the road.

Over the last few years I've done about 5 months total backpacking in the past in Europe, but I've done a few weeks solo travel and while it terrifies me (a bit of social anxiety), I often find that I'm the most confident and have the least anxiety when I'm forced into the beautiful situations backpacking puts one in and I think doing the expat thing for a while will do wonders for my confidence and overall satisfaction with life and give me some purpose, even if that purpose is simply to immerse myself in travel and foreign culture.

So now my gameplan is to finish my 2 weeks here at this job in Denver, put the rest into storage. Figure out something to do with my car--either sell or store it. Figure out something to do with my gaming desktop PC--likely sell/part it or store it. And then take off for Asia. I figure backpack around Asia for a month or so just getting my bearings and figuring out where my favorite spots are, and then start hitting the pavement with a suit and a binder of resumes to find some employment. Everything I've read about countries a little more off the mainstream path--Vietnam or Cambodia for example--is that their culture appreciates face to face conversations more-so than internet and generally you'll have a better go of it if you just go to the schools and apply versus trying to cruise Dave's ESL or whatnot. What are your experiences with this?

I'm really torn on where specifically I want to go teach. I've got close friends who rave about Vietnam and have spent a significant chunk of time over there and it's probably my top choice. I'm really curious about Cambodia and Myanmar as well. I'm sure Thailand would be a safe pick, I'll head West and try my luck there. Will a CELTA be worth it for these countries? I'd like to take some sort of certification like CELTA so I can have a little bit more of a clue for the teaching portion of things--while I hold a degree in English, it wasn't a teaching degree and I have pretty much zero experience in front of a classroom as a teacher.

I do unfortunately have a smudge on my background check from my first year at University--I was caught driving wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy too fast in my car, all charges except the speeding itself were ultimately dropped/dismissed/deferred, but I know just having the arrest report on my history will rule out a few countries for me--specifically S.Korea and likely Japan--I plan on making some calls to embassies to try and get more clear answers on whether I'll be able to get work visas in places in the coming week, though. I've heard mixed reports on whether I'd be eligible for a work visa in China or not. I'm not looking to work without a work visa or attempt anything shady.

So a little background. I graduated in December with a major in marketing. I've had about 3 promosing interviews since then of which none resulted in a job. So I'm living at home and detailing cars as my own business for money. Well I have been getting everything in order to teach in korea and have another interview coming up. Since I have no experience in marketing besides a small startup with a friend the parents are wanting me to ditch everything I've gathered for Korea and take this job (haven't had an interview yet).

Now I really want to go to Korea. I've never traveled out of the USA, let me say for me if I take it I do not think I'll ever go if that happens. I have nothing tying me down no, no gf, not a ton of friends local anymore (all moved) and no bills or apt. To me this seems the perfect time to take the opportunity to move to korea for a year, teach, travel some, blog, and do lots more photography than I've done lately.  

Since this has actually been more of a rant let me ask the real question. 

If I do not get/turn down the job in Texas and go to korea for a year. Am I really screwing myself over when I eventually come back to the states and look for a job in Marketing again? I don't think that teaching abroad looks bad on a résumé. Hell I think it looks pretty good. However

Enter slowmoon. 25 years old.  I'm an American currently teaching in mainland China. I have teaching experience, China is probably one of the best places to make money. I pay almost no taxes. Demand is high. I regularly get unsolicited offers to teach people for 200+ RMB (30+ USD per hour), which seems similar to what people get in Japan or Korea, but China's cost of living is much lower. Saving $2000 USD per month working less than 40 hours per week is pretty doable. It's really easy to get a job. I could pay an ""ayi"" very little to clean my apartment and cook if I wanted.  

So why move to Japan? People on Reddit and other places online say that the Japanese economy isn't good. The market's saturated. There's more competition. It's harder to get a job. There's less demand. My quality of life won't be as good. Well, and smells. I'm not in it for the money. I want to live in a relatively big city. I've already visited Tokyo and the Kansai area and I think the Osaka suits my style the most. In other words, I am completely willing to take a hit in the comfort of my life in order to teach in Japan because I like Japanese culture and people. 

From my research, so I'd likely end up in a rural area. I'm not interested in that.

Interac seems like a good option to get started as they'll sponsor a visa.  After I get to Japan

I'm not trying to screw anyone over. Would it be considered bad form to work somewhere for 6 months and then change location/jobs once I get my visa?

* How do I go about getting a job? Are there any good online job listings or resources that you would recommend?
* Is there a preferred time of year to start?  I am thinking of sometime in the late summer or early fall of 2011
* What kind of pay and perks can I expect?  Do schools usually pay for things like rent and flights?  I still have student loans and would like to be able to put at least a little bit of cash into those as I work.  Is that a reasonable goal?
* Would you recommend going over there to find a job or finding a job here before leaving?
* Where would the best place be to live and teach?  I am pretty young (23), beaches, mountain biking).
* My number 1 concern with going over there is that I'm kind of worried that I won't meet any other North Americans or Europeans to hang out with. Also that the language barrier would make it nearly impossible to find any Taiwanese to hang out with.  Basically
* I'd like to learn mandarin.  I know absolutely no mandarin at the moment
* Should I be considering certifications for teaching English before I leave?  Keep in mind that I am a native English speaker (Canadian)
* How do visas work?  Can I expect my employer to take care of that
* How does vacation time work?  Are there many holidays which can be used as travel time?  Is flying to mainland Asia and tramping around for a week on a holiday something that would be reasonably priced and possible if you are teaching full time?

I am seriously considering teaching English in either China or South Korea. I have been doing research and have discovered lots of blogs about why people hated their experience and one common thread I observed is their stories of employers taking advantage of foreign English teachers through non-payment and last minute scheduling changes. 

I am currently a teacher in the US and some of what I am hearing is typical behavior of administrators/school districts. I was really jazzed and excited to teach in a foreign land (because I love to teach) but I'm hesitant now...

Im reaching out to this subreddit to find out the following questions:

1. What recruiting agency (if any) did you go through and were you satisfied? Why or why not?
2. What school did you teach at?
3. Were your experiences at the schools unlike experiences you had here teaching in the US?
4. What kind of employment opportunities came about when you returned to your native land based on your experience in the different Asian cultures?
5. Would you be willing to send pictures of your residence provided by the schools?

But what do those rules mean in the context of /r/tefl?

The moderator and I had a small discussion here: http://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/comments/190yr6/a_teachers_complete_guide_to_using_google_voice/c8k519c

The site I linked to was an education blog which is published under a Creative Commons license, no click-throughs, just informative content laid out directly on the screen. And that's what educational bloggers tend to do: they try to write useful posts both to network with other educators and to provide a service to the field. There's no real way to monetize it. There's no value in mailing lists or whatever other crap commercial bloggers try to do.

Sure, let alone live off of that money. One of the major blogs I follow, Serendipity35, recently reported that despite their getting about half a million hits per month, the income from their ads is pathetically small: http://www.serendipity35.net/index.php?/archives/2731-Serendipity35-Celebrates-A-Birthday.html

And that's probably because the type of people smart enough to be drawn to teaching and to educational technology probably know how to install an ad-blocker anyway. :p

So I get the spirit of ""no blogspam"" and ""no commercial posts"", unless it were one blog rehashing the content of another blog? We're not exactly a big demographic or a consumer group.

1373393278.0,1hy6jb,Denied a job because of online certification,AgingSkydiver,13,2,15,"I recently obtained my TEFL certification from the International TEFL Academy's online course. Their course looked like the standard 120 hour in class and 20 hour practicum (teaching in a classroom) certification. I was taking their class at the same time as my last semester in college. My goal was to graduate from both and then find a job teaching in Moscow in the fall. I graduated my TEFL class with the highest grade possible (A1 is what they call it) and began my job search. 

I found this [article](http://www.internationalteflacademy.com/alumni-country-questions-and-answers/bid/115454/Moscow-Russia-English-Teaching-Q-and-A-with-Annie-Chen) about a girl who was teaching in Moscow with BKC International House. She is a graduate from the International TEFL Academy also. The only difference was her class was in a class room and mine was online. We had the same course material however.  I did some further research into BKC seemed alright. So I applied for a job with the them. 

I received an e-mail back from them stating that they would not accept my certification because it was taken online. Has this happened to anyone else?

Edit: Just to be a bit more clear

I didn't make this post to complain or say anything was unfair. During my research I never came across anyone else with this particular problem. I wanted to see if anyone else had this issue. I probably should have realized that companies would prefer in-class certificates. I looked into the in-class programs but given that I was in my last semester of college I just didn't have the time/money to take a course somewhere else.

 In 2 weeks I will be switching jobs. I'll still be in China but I'll be teaching at an all Korean school. I am really excited for the switch for 2 reasons. One is that I will be teaching a higher level, work books, choose or write tests and do the grading. They will provide general goals (this class is a TOEFL prep class, this one is SAT prep, this one is an academic writing class, etc) and an entire library of books to choose from.

  I am really excited for this, I've never worked for a Korean school or with Korean staff. Has anyone worked for both and able to give some general advice?

  For instance, and occasionally a conversation will sprout up, but things like having lunch together, talking about personal lives (in a very general sense) or doing things together outside of work is completely foreign, and that is how the management seems to like it. Have you found that staff at Korean schools are similar? I'm hoping for a more personable relationship to be honest, but of course that will vary by person.

  There's definitely going to be a lot more planning involved with the new classes, and there's a lot of control from management about what gets taught and how long it should take, so my planning is pretty narrow and as a result I'm probably going to stumble a bit going to such an open ended approach. To other teachers that more or less plan classes from scratch, what kind of framework do you use for a lesson plan? I'm sure it will be different for different classes and different ages, but just a general outline would be fantastic, right now my outlines are geared for beginner to lower intermediate language learners, so a typical lesson plan will include:

some form of warm up where I can throw in a little review from last lesson, but I am curious if anyone knows where I could find the framework of a decent lesson plan?

I was chatting with a friend of mine who is a native speaker of Mandarin but has only been speaking English daily for about five years. Her English is very good; she only makes a few small grammatical errors that I've noticed

She wants me to recommend a good English grammar textbook. Are you guys able to help me recommend her one? She only asked for an English grammar textbook

* What cities would you suggest? I have thought about Gwangju, Busan, and Bundang, but really as long as I'm not in the middle of Seoul, I think I'll be fine. To preface this, I am not looking for a ton of nightlife activity or anything - I stay at home frequently and play video games (yes, I'm that lame). 

* Piggybacking off my last question, or just cleverly packing it away amongst my baggage for the flight?

* As for powering my PC, and sound system? Or would I need to get several converters?

* Back to school topics. Do you personally prefer hagwons or public schools? I am unsure of which I want to do, which I understood to be a necessary component for public school positions (at least until you have experience with other schools). 

* If I were to go with a hagwon

* I've read in several places that bringing $1000 (USD) is probably the safest thing to do, the first 6 weeks in Korea? Obviously it also would depend on where I end up, but any ideas would be helpful.

* I am quite a large (read: overweight) fella, as well as how awkward it can be to live in Korea and be so grossly overweight as most of the population is tiny. I understand shopping for clothes and shoes and such will be an issue, but other than that, will I honestly have much trouble because of my weight?

* Similar to my previous question

* I have facial piercings as well as wrist tattoos

* Public schools vs. Hagwons aside

I have found that so many people who work in ESL/multicultural services, simply do not seem to care that much about the students. Many times, I've felt a certain condescension that I did not expect from somebody in this industry. All in all, the impression I get is that they simply do not care enough and seem to be just doing this routine without a genuine love of teaching. I have had good teachers but not in the ESL department. I know what good teaching is, but sadly many ESL teachers and especially, administrators fail to convey that. Many of them need to understand the large impact ESL program staff have on international students/students in any country that employs foreign ESL teachers. We'll remember it for life, and having a bad teacher means that we not only have bad English for life, and refrain from speaking it

This is not saying there are no good ESL teachers. I have had friends who's teachers were great and who still keep in touch with their teachers. All I'm saying that it gets on my nerves when I see the kinds of posts in this thread, because damn it's not that easy to teach English to people who know nothing about the language.

Firstly apologies for the block of text.  I've been thinking a lot about my future lately and would really appreciate your insight.

I am currently trying to decide on what steps to take next.  I'm torn between three options...each has advantages and disadvantages.

Firstly a little information about me and my situation.....I'm currently teaching English in China. I first found out about this career when handing in my dissertation at university (I have a B.A. degree in history). After researching this further I completed a CELTA course and have been in China ever since. I'm having a really good time here (2 years so far).  However

So onto my dilemma. The way I see it

*Stay where I am*

**Pros**

I like it here.  I have a stable job


**Cons**

No professional development (I could be doing the same job for the next 10 years and little would change).  
Low pay.

*Teach somewhere else*

**Pros**

I could work somewhere which would allow professional development.  Somewhere with experienced teachers/teacher trainers hopefully.  
I'd see a different part of the world.
Better pay(?)

**Cons**

The job may be terrible.
The location may be terrible.

*Study for an M.A.*

**Pros**

Much better career prospects.  
Become a better teacher.

**Cons**

Expensive.
I may not pass - this is my biggest worry

What I do know is that I would like to study for an M.A. sometime in the future

My main worry is that my knowledge of the English grammar is severely lacking. This may sound odd to those of you who will think, that in China, the vast majority of English teachers focus only on Oral English. Which is why experience in China isn't counted for much elsewhere in the world.

Most M.A. courses I've looked at state 2 year's teaching experience as a requirement.  I barely have that and in a part of the world which doesn't have the highest standards... I fear I may be rushing into things when I'm not ready.  At the same time though I think it's fear that's holding me back (fear of failure - I've never been confident

So I'd really like to hear your opinions.  Especially those of you on/have completed an M.A. in Applied Linguistics/TESOL (or related area - there's a lot of acronyms in this game!). And especially about your background (degree

Most of my students have an okay (between mid novice or mid intermediate) grasp of listening and speaking, watch baby""). They struggle a lot with reading and writing, as many have never had any formal training in English.

I've tried playing games and roleplaying

My superior is not trained in ESL (and mostly just yells at students when they don't understand her), and the alphabet, which they all already know. I have virtually no materials beyond a couple word lists, and I have no prior experience teaching English. I don't have access to a copier, but I can print some pages using my own money. I do have a whiteboard, but I don't have any real multimedia capabilities. I don't think I can give out homework, but I'd be willing to try and see how it goes.

I plan as of now is to present short basic English stories to them, and do short dictations on important words, though I don't know if this is what is best for me to do.

I took 12 years of French in school growing up but I'm very rusty so I'd say my level at this moment is an A2. If I brushed up on my French I could probably come up to a B1 or B2 by next fall. In other words I have lots of random French knowledge built up in my head but using it is a totally different thing.

I'm taking the CELTA next month and then I'm going to work in Chicago for a year to save up as much money as I can for my travels. During that time I will also work on gathering up important documents and doing what I have to visa-wise. First question: Do I need to get an FBI background check? I read that somewhere on reddit and they were saying it's a LONG process. 

I'm writing all this because I know everyone says it's almost impossible for a US citizen to gain TEFL employment in Western Europe. But I'm very interested in going to France because of my time learning French, I know the only place right now where TEFL is lucrative is S. Korea. But I'm not interested in S. Korea at all. Thailand would be great but it's not my first choice. I am also interested in Latin America. Argentina, Chile and Brazil to be specific. I know the money over there isn't good either but I'm obviously not pursuing this path for the money. I am also open to Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Croatia, Turkey - would these countries be easier to find jobs in? Would it be easier to start out in Eastern Europe and work my way west?

My father is going to be a patient in an day care program for the elderly.  Some of the other patients are non-native English speakers who still want to learn, and although he can read, there are limits on what he can concentrate on.  The same is true of some of the learners.  Whatever might happen would be much more like conversation than conventional ESL teaching.  On the other hand, he's a retired teacher and was interested in trying ESL teaching anyway.  The idea of helping other patients in this program is something he has a lot of enthusiasm for.  I'm looking for anything that might help him - ideally in book or workbook format, but anything is OK.

Here are a few things I found browsing on amazon.  I hope this will give you a better idea of what I'm looking for.

* book ""The ESL/ELL Teacher's Book of Lists"" - Looks comprehensive.  I'm unsure whether it would be easy enough to use.  It looks like it provides raw materials more than ready-to-go exercises.
* workbook ""200+ Games for the Foreign Language Classroom"" - There's no preview or reviews for this
* book ""Teaching English as a Foreign Language For Dummies"" - What I liked about this one was that it has a short section - 50 pages - on teaching grammar, it didn't look very useful for his particular situation.

So the first topic I want to raise is something I might end up doing a project on.  When teaching in a foreign country
  
I have in front of me a number of journal articles about English teaching in China, Chinese students often take English classes to pass exams. Speaking is not a big requirement for them, and many native English speakers (NES) focus on speaking which is detrimental to the students' primary goals.  Although a NES might think that a student should be good at speaking, they must consider what the *students* goal is as well. Here are some quotes from *Teach English in China: Conflicts and Expectations* by Siping Liu published by The International Journal - Language, Society and Culture in 2010:  
  
When discussing why Chinese students are not vocal in class Liu writes
&gt;Chinese students usually believed that questions indicated that the teacher didn't explain clearly and any questions to challenge the teacher would make him or her lose face in front of the whole class.  
Regarding teaching styles
&gt;Chinese students learn better if they can learn in their own way: start with rote memorization
  
From *Cultural Factors Affecting Chinese ESL Students' Academic Learning* by Jinyan Huang published in Education #129 Summer 2009 she writes that this is due to the historical context of Chinese learners and how the Chinese education system has been examination-driven since Confucius' time (the imperial examinations). Studying ""The Five Classics"" and ""The Four Books"" didn't cease until 1905 so its no surprise to see that cultural mentality still lingering in Chinese society.  
  
So what do you think?  Should we force Western notions of education on non-Western cultures or should we adapt to their cultural style and try to be more accomodating for their goals and aspirations?",self,t5_2qq76,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/comments/pil94/tefl_issues_lets_discuss/

I've read that the best jobs are at universities and I have an offer from a university in China which sounds great

-The contract doesn't mention anything about a Z-visa.  I've read that I shouldn't accept a contract that doesn't freely provide this.  Is the Z-Visa assumed?

-The contract mentions that I cannot ""render service elsewhere"" without the university's consent.  Does this rule out private teaching on the side (I'm kind of counting on that income)?

-Would there be a lot of support for a newbie teacher?  This would be my first TEFL job.

-Does anything else look abnormal?


Also, I still have very little idea how to plan out lessons weeks/months in advance.  Any suggestions that might help me to hit the ground running?  I'm terrified that I'll arrive in China and the school officials will ask me for my lesson plans and I will have no idea what to do.  Would you recommend a university for a first teaching job, or should I go with a private english school that provides all of your lessons in advance?  Thanks so much, and sorry for the wall of text/wall of contract.

 I'm planning on applying for the EPIK program for the spring 2014 semester.

Right now I have my BSc degree but no experience in teaching at all.

Now

My questions are:
Should I do the 120 hour i-to-i TEFL course (mostly online) as a warm up?

Would that online TEFL course be worth it?

Would that online TEFL be enough to apply to EPIK with a chance of success as I'd be scared to wait longer than 

November to apply whether or not I do the TESOL course.

How hard are the TESOL/CELTA courses?


I'm mostly curious about the difficulty of TESOL as I'm not opposed in any way to doing it. I have saved up the money to be able to do this as I've had it in my head for over a year now.

Although I am mostly looking to experience Korea

It seems like teaching does draw some people who are frustrated arbiters, a teacher basically interrogated a student before the student could enter the testing room. It is a matter of course that certain items are not permitted in the testing room.

2-TEFL certification? I'm seeing contradictory things here. One person I've spoken to, if I decide I want some kind of certificate that means I won't have as much of those funds, but the trade off, perhaps, is that I will get more and better work. I suspect the truth is inbetween, but am curious how useful it is.

It seems like paying a small amount isn't worth the paper it's printed on

3-Visa process. This is where I tend to see the same information, essentially is to just go there, find a place to live and start applying. As an American I can move there and start looking for work on a Schengen pass and once I have a job offer, I can apply for a residency/work permit. Most TEFL-companies won't hire you beforehand is my understanding. Also, therefore, it's my understanding that you cannot apply for the visa beforehand. Just want to make sure I get that process correctly. I'm not too terribly, terribly worried as I am quite frugal/minimalist and worst case scenario I get a 3-month holiday as I intend to save enough to have return airfare and money to live on for 5-6 months. The only exception I'm seeing is coming from some smaller TEFL-Cert places that claim they can place you in Germany

4-Where to go?

This is open ended. I know roughly what I am personally looking for, that would be much appreciated.

I am trying to decide between doing a CELTA class (probably in Thailand or on the West Coast) or earning a continuing education certificate from the college where I gained my Bachelors Degree. [KSU TESOL](http://www.kennesaw.edu/coned/tesol/)
It is also about half the cost of the CELTA course when you factor in the plane ticket and expenses. I'm just worried about its value in the job market.

I would rather do the CELTA but that would mean quitting my full-time job and losing all my current income.

Also I failed to be accepted into the JET Program and my interview with AEON is not until November. Will getting my certificate in Thailand and/ or teaching in other countries help or hurt my prospects in Japan?

They have a lot of resources available

The most important part of the first lesson will be getting to know her, ranging from basic to advanced, so that once we get to know each other we can do something relevant.

So far

1. basic/introductory conversation - ""Hi, as it seems like it would be insulting to someone who is already an intermediate or advanced English speaker.

2. culture and history of halloween - if she has good conversation skills and is interested in learning new vocabulary and some American culture

3. Verbs with prepositions - the difference between putting on a coat, putting off your homework, and putting an eggo waffle in the toaster. I found this type of vocabulary to be immensely useful when I was an intermediate German student, so I figure it will work well if she's studied English but not been immersed for very long.


4. Idioms - What does it mean when someone says ""Just give me a ballpark figure"" or ""that's right on the money""? This will be if she is near fluent with literal meanings of words but wants to really immerse herself in Californian/American English and its subtleties.

So that's my current plan. Someone in r/Lingusitics told me not to worry about having lots of exercises prepared and just to focus on learning what she needs. I respected his advice, but I'd like to start right up with some work. Is there anything else I might add to my arsenal to fill in the beginner/intermediate/advanced gaps? And are there any interesting difficulties that Koreans in particular will be likely to have when learning English?

I'll probably be back to report on how this went and get some more advice after the first lesson.

Pearls of wisdom..

Be patient with your students


Management in ESL.. bwahahahahahahahah.. more or less non-existent. Most Directors of Studies, or whatever it is they designate the poor schmuck they have between you and the school upper administration is there to screen the school admins/owners from dealing directly with their freaky foreign staff. 

Your DoS's power really is fairly limited in what he/she can do. 

Always keep your get the fuck out of dodge money intact. Don't go on a bender of booze

Teaching TEFL is a job. Treat it like one. Don't be showing up wasted

Teaching is something you need to put a huge amount of energy into. Get some sleep the night before you hit the classroom. Eat well, and you'll be ok in the end. 

Resources for teachers are plentiful on the internet

Lots of people say you should get a CELTA or something like that before you go teach. I personally think you should spend time teaching before you go teach as a means of paying your way through the world. 

I suspect if you did both you'd be better off.. do try to get experience teaching in order to develop your presence in front of others. It helps.

Controlling your classroom starts before you enter the room. Be ready to bend the students to your will
- Create a behavioral management plan.. implement that son of a bitch as soon as you hit the floor. 

Breathe confidence.. exude it from your pores.. look like you know what you are doing even if you don't know.

I'm from Canada and am in HK at the moment on the 90-day 'no-visa-needed' permit. 

I have a family friend here in HK who operates a language centre. She's offered me a full-time teaching position for 4-5 year old's.

Start Date: September 2013

Type of job: Conversational English teacher

Age range: 5-99

Working hours: around 20 per week

After June

Pay: 350 rubles per academic hour (45 minutes)

Required qualifications: The school would prefer a BA and CELTA but they've had very positive experiences with people who don't have substantial qualifications. If you can impress the director with experience, Ufa is a provincial city and it might be difficult to get around if you don't speak any Russian. Most of the school's non-teaching staff doesn't speak English, as well.

Accommodation: None. The school will help you with locating an apartment. Monthly rent in Ufa ranges from ~8000 rubles for a room rental and ~13000+ rubles for a private studio apartment. Apartments in Russia are almost always furnished so you won't need to worry about that.

Work visa: The school will provide the letter of invitation but you will need to obtain a visa from a Russian consulate. The school will handle the transfer from a temporary work visa to a 1-3 year visa before the temporary visa expires. They will also handle renewing the visa

Contract: The school will start you off with a 6 month contract to see if you are a good fit for them, within legal limits (3 years max).

Additional information: Travel during the school year will be problematic

Taxes for foreigners are 30% for the first 183 days of your stay in Russia

Getting your own private students is not officially allowed but the school doesn't mind if you do this. The going rate for private lessons is ~500 rubles per hour.

About the school: It is a private school with a couple of locations throughout the city. The director of the school has great English

About Ufa: Population ~1, there's a fair amount of cultural activities, good restaurants and outdoor activities with which to entertain yourself. Cost of living, food, and entertainment is substantially lower than Moscow or St. Petersburg. Regarding safety, I don't have the crime rate statistics but I have never had any problems in Ufa during my 18 months here. Regarding racism, Ufa has always had a high Muslim and Caucasian population and due to this, the climate is harsher than that of Moscow and St. Petersburg

2) As far as preference countries go (aside from Japan), and Indonesia more than any other countries, so would it be possible to land jobs there with an English/TESOL degree and some experience under my belt? Or will the minor in TESOL not be enough?

**SHORT VERSION:**

* Taught in Korea for 2 years. 
* Liked some parts but got tired of the ultra nationalism, ugly/dirty country, messed up education system.
* Have been to Japan 4 times and enjoyed it. Seemed like the country I should've gone to in the first place instead of Korea.
* If I go to Japan
* The Czech Republic is tempting because life will be easier. But
* I'm considering doing Japan and then the Czech Republic when I'm done but there is a chance I'll get tired of teaching English and will go to grad school in Europe instead.
* Ideally I'd like to do both Japan and the Czech Republic. 
* I want to live in Europe after Asia. I'm worried that if I like Japan and spend a few years there then the market for EFL in the Czech Republic will be diminished and I won't be able to go. When I do go to Europe

**LONG VERSION:**

I taught English in Korea for two years. It was a fascinating experience and I'm glad that I did it, poor food, screwed up education system, and the relatively ugly/dirty country as a whole. It would've helped if the people were more down-to-earth, but they weren't. I travelled to Japan 4 times while I was living in Korea and enjoyed it quite a bit every time I went. It stood out in stark contrast to me coming from Korea; the food was decent, it was much cleaner, the country was a lot more beautiful, it seemed like there were more subcultures and a bit more room for self expression (i.e. different fashion styles, and things were more orderly in general. Japan seemed like the country I should've gone to in the first place instead of Korea.

That said

I've always kept the Czech Republic or Europe in general in mind as my back up plan for once I'm tired of living in Asia. It will be much easier for me to live there. Culturally they are more similar to my own, and the food is right up my alley. Basically I know that I would have an easier time living there. 

If I go to Japan it would be my last country in Asia. I'm drawn to do it because I don't feel like I'm done with Asia yet and Japan seems like the best fit for me personally. However

Here are some of the plans I devised in my head. 

Plan #1 - Go to Japan. If I don't like it

Plan #2 - Go to Japan. Like it

Plan #3 - Go to the Czech Republic. Teach first

Basically

Please be as honest as you can. I've been going back and forth on this in my head for months. Should I give Japan a chance,False,self,t5_2qq76,1360823555.0,,,t3_18h4au

With my choices in life it's inevitable that I will be poorly paid (relative to others with degrees in other subjects), so I may as well enjoy my work if nothing else. I enjoyed teaching, but decided to take time out to try something else.

So, as the experience isn't valued by, well, anyone really. It would be nice to go somewhere I could stay a while, build a life and career, move towards the uni goal, maybe be part of an emerging economy rather than a dying one.

1) Costs. What would be a wise amount of money to bring for start up costs? Such as housing (do you have to put money down, etc.), transportation, plane ticket, other living expenses. What would you say would be a bare minimum, an average amount, and ""more than enough""? I'm currently doing full time temp work to afford the TEFL classes

2) Background check. I had an arrest for possession of marijuana but the charges were dismissed and the case was dropped. Will this affect my eligibility/show up on the background tests that are used?

3) Recruiters. I have read that recruiters are the way to go

4) Areas of Korea. Ideally

It was this problem that led me into looking for jobs over in South Korea. I got a hold of a recruiter by accident and he brought me up to speed on the process for getting over there. I was actually asked to go to Korea once before after I graduated in 2010. I regret not doing that now because I wonder where I could be at this time had I done that. However

Now

 I submitted my FBI check in mid july. Since then I have an offer to go teach for 2 million won per month. They sent me a contract two hours after interview. The interview was really short. I heard this was not uncommon. I'm surprised I even got one so fast. The recruiter said that schools are not talking to people unless they have all their documents first. This school happened to have a huge need for November and that is enough time for me to get all my stuff. So it happens to work out nicely.

Anyways, severance, paying for apartment etc. What kind of incentives would another school offer? I also hear that public school is the best. Again, having no experience, I'm not sure how much better I can actually get and that is ok if that is the case.

It is a little nerve racking

I recently (less than a month ago) graduated from college with a B.A. in English. I've always planned on teaching - I love the language arts

The prospect of teaching abroad seems almost *too* good to be true. There are organizations in my area looking for people to teach in Asia, money or opportunity to study abroad, it only seems like a win-win situation. That being said, I haven't applied anywhere and I don't *really* know how good a shot I have at getting hired. I've prowled this subreddit for some time and have looked into getting a CELTA certification, but at the moment I'm a bit strapped on cash (more on that later). From my perspective, eventually getting certified seems worth it. However, the jobs I've seen do not require any certification other than a Bachelor's degree. Is this a red flag? 

I don't want to look at this as some sort of r/IWantOut fantasy. I do want out, and nothing comparable to a year. I don't feel like I would have a horribly difficult time acclimating to a new society. I realize that sounds naive coming from a 22 year old, but I know people do it. Teaching is what I want to do as a career, so I'm willing to do what I can to make it as interesting and new of an experience as possible. But in your honest opinion, would it be unwise to take a job in a foreign country I've never been to, doing a job I've never done before (I have some tutoring experience), even if it's something I plan on turning into a career eventually

Now for the complicated part. 

I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease back in high school, once a week. It requires home delivery and refrigeration. I know this is kind of an oddly specific question, but is it even feasible to maintain these sort of health necessities while working abroad? So long as it is shipped cold, the medication lasts. But say I wound in in Korea, or Japan - is it even possible to have something like medication sent overseas? Will I run into any sort of customs problems? My doctors said that there shouldn't be an issue shipping it, but I think I would feel more comfortable if I knew about anyone else's experience with shipping stuff like this overseas. 

Now all of that information above is what I meant by I'm a bit ""strapped for cash"". Had a couple of crazy medical things go on over the past few months. I'm getting back to full health

Phew, but it all seems too fun to be true. Both my family and I agree that I would do well in a country like Korea or Japan, where the pay is good enough and there's an established English teaching base.

I had promising interviews but have been feeling quite discouraged after nearly four months of this.

Maybe a game in which I could draw a map/board on the blackboard and then divide the class into teams who must form their strategy

I'm 21, so I have decided that if I am unsuccessful I will pursue a CELTA qualification, so at least I will be a little prepared for teaching and can contribute more.

My question is do I take the CELTA qualification in England? or abroad? The benefits of doing it in England is that English is the teacher's primary language and I can concentrate on the work (not treating it as a holiday). But the benefits of doing it abroad is that I am able to create contacts(either with the students who are also on the course, are there any other points I have missed? 

Price is another factor £1, Hangzhou, Shanghai) not including flight fees, which to China might cost around £500-£700. I don't know if I can justify these fees coming from a low income background and not currently having a job. Do you guys know of any other schools or universities offering CELTA courses in China or Japan? or could you perhaps recommend one?

Another idea I was thinking about was getting a teaching job in China/Japan with just my BSc then save up for a CELTA that way

Sorry for the long wall of text, spelling and increasing one's vocabulary)  as well as teaching methodologies?

I'm just curious about these things...my main questions are :

a.  has anybody who is teaching in latin america used a placement service or become certified there

b.  does having tefl/tesol certification ACTUALLY HELP or am I better off just finding under the table teaching work on a tourist visa?
