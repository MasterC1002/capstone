**How I made $500 in a single night**

So my town is pretty small.  The only saving grace for a delivery driver is that there is a state university in town and you can make bank off the college students. Most nights I worked I would bank around $100 in tips.  This story takes place later in my delivery career when I was 23.

The forecast had been calling for heavy snow.  Rumor was we were going to get about an inch or two an hour all night.  It started early on around 2:00 but was pretty light.  For a while we figured the forecast was a bit exaggerated so my manager said we’d stay open unless it started to get bad.

Around 8:00 a the roads started to get bad as the snow started to pick up.  About the same time our phones started ringing off the hook with people calling our store because the other pizza places where shutting down.

My manager looked at meI told my manager and asked what I though.  “You’re the one out there

Over the course of the next 4 hours I had the town to myself. I got stopped at one point by a cop asking me what I was doing out on the roads.  Luckily he recognized me (*my dad was a local firefighter and had even been police commissioner for a while*) and he told me to just ""be safe"" and stay out of the way of the plows and emergency vehicles.

Every house I delivered to was grateful that I was willing to deliver.  I got about a dozen cups of hot chocolate and tips ranging from $10 to $20.  At one point I had to stop and fill up because I was burning extra gas being in 4-wheel-drive 100% the whole time.

When we finally shut down at 12:00 I counted out just over $500 in tips.  That was not including my hourly rate plus the per-pizza delivery charge that I got.  Pretty much the best night of tips I had.

From that point on I was known as the “Pizza Jeep Guy.”  Which is a good jumping off point for another story.  ",,t5_2uh13,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/14fzbx/how_i_made_500_in_a_single_night_story_4/

They wanted us to deliver a pepperoni pizza to their son at a hotel.

I got to the hotel and knocked on the door to the room which we were given. The couple answered the door and told me that their son was in the room next to them. They got out their video camera and started filming me. I knocked on the door to the son's hotel room and he answered the door.... he was a goth kid wearing all black with black eyeliner and dyed black hair. I think it was his 17th birthday.

**Bootlegged right in front of campus police**

There was a small amount of snow started to collect but it was nothing major.  All the main roads were fine and most of the secondary roads were just a little slushy.  About the only place the snow seemed to be accumulating was in the parking lots.

My current run had me ping-ponging around campus to all the different dorms.  It was a lot of running around but it was worth it.  One of my orders was for the on campus apartment building.  I recognized the room number as being at the back of the building.  I also knew there was a skinny maintenance path that led to the dumpsters behind the apartment building.  I figured it would be my best bet to make life easy.

I wrap around the one dorm and pull into the parking lot which had a small layer of unplowed snow.  It wasn’t enough to warrant 4wd so I just kept the Jeep in rear-wheel-drive.

After jumping out and delivering the pizza I looked back down the maintenance path and saw that the entire parking lot was empty

For those that aren’t familiar with the “bootleg” maneuver you basically drive in reverse as fast as you can then hit the brakes (usually the parking break to lock up the rear wheels), and then hit the gas.  If conditions are right, and you pull it off, it’s a seamless 180 degree turn with no loss of momentum.

So I kick the keep in reverse, cut the wheel to the side, spin the Jeep around, hit the gas and pull off a flawless textbook 180 bootleg.

I am smiling to myself as I get to the end of the parking lot… then my heart sinks.  Sitting at the opposing stop sign in a campus police car.

Now, sworn-in police officers.  They are notorious hard-asses for the shit they have to put up with on and around campus.

I was delivering to a commercial apartment building in Seattle. It's where people from out of town on business stay for a week or more.

A guy answers the door and he says ""I forgot my wallet

I'm trying my best to be polite but let him know that I don't want a conversation with short easy answers.

He says ""What's the biggest tip you've ever gotten?"" - I said ""Well

I'm 100% confident I know where this is going. He's holding a bill (still in his wallet) and his hand is shaking and he's acting creepy. My spider senses are tingling. but I can't accuse him of doing something he hasn't done yet. So I'm trying to diffuse the situation: ""Well, so you don't have to give me anything if you don't want to.""

He says ""Would you like a $20 tip?""

He starts to slow down because he's starting to stutter now

I was stunned that he actually did what I thought he was going to do. I just said ""no."" in a ""definitive

He says ""Not even just to look?"" (In my head

Now he's shaking really hard and incredibly embarrassed. He hands me the $20 and says ""Well

I called up my best friend at the time and tell him what just happened. The first words out of his mouth: ""Did you do it?"" I said: ""No!"" he says: ""Dude

Everyone at the store laughed, I realized I probably got off lucky.

I started working at Pizza Hut in high school as a cook and that lasted for almost a year. Once I graduated and turned 18 I quickly switched over to a driver because who wouldn't want a $10/hr raise right? Having cook experience both hurt and really helped my job at times because if the restaurant was busy but we were slow on deliveries they would have me hop on the make line/cut table to help out

Anyway on to the story. My local ISP has a headquarters in my hometown and they would occasionally place some huge orders 1-2 weeks in advance and word would get around and everybody would know about it. I was scheduled to be opening driver at 10 am so I could help out making this specific $2500 order (250 pizzas). When I got to work at 10

So

The clock strikes eleven and the preplaced order for the ISP starts coming out of our printer and I start loading the pizzas into my car

I end up making it to the ISP and after multiple trips back and forth from my car and into the building the part where the signing of the credit card receipt/tipping phase came about. The woman looks at me and says, let's make it an even 3000."" I then thanked her sincerely and she just looks at me and says ""It's the company card anyway. Not like it's coming out of my pocket.""

I thank the guy and turn around and get ready to walk away when he says

""Nice tits

Then he thanked me for complimenting his new wife and closed the door.

We had this lady, always the same thing; Medium Triple Sausage.  She wasn't a big lady, she was rather thin and had one little dog.  She was nice, but didn't talk too much to us.  Every time she called, we'd just let her know it would be there in about twenty to thirty minutes.  Always paid cash/check, always tipped decent, always friendly.

Four days go by, but didn't act.  Five days, six days, and finally a week goes by, no call from Sausage Lady.  A little odd, and now the crew's actually a bit worried over her not calling.  One of the driver's cruises past her place, but since it's an apartment, he can't tell if he sees her vehicle or not.

I knocked using the large doorknockers on the massive doors in front of me, but no answer. I ring the door bell, hidden behind bushes cute in neat little spirals, and a nice tune echoed inside.  The large door swung open, seemingly wearing nothing but a royal blue silk bathrobe, explaining through her thick accent how thankful she was that I was bringing her food.  She led me to the kitchen

She pulls out some money and hands me a one hundred dollar bill

I replied

""No no no

I stuttered, ""you've never been here before, have you?""  I hadn't. ""Well, that's how we do things"".  She then stood holding the front door, smiling and waving as I drove away.

I was the only driver at the times
I must say at this point I was terrified

At this point he invited me in. To this day I don't know why I agreed but I entered. I did make him lead though. Something about a semi naked strange man behind me made me a little uneasy. As he led me through his small apt he went through a tiny hall way to the living room. before he entered tho he stopped at the entrance and looked in his kitchen, that's what I'm doing."" I look around the wall into the cove-like-kitchen to see a not so attractive woman, bent over wearing bright orange tiny shorts and a white tank top, pouring boxed wine into a Styrofoam cup. She notices me finally and stands up, clearly drunk, and exclaims, ""its the pizza man!"" 

At this point I realize that the man is gone! A half naked man is never a good thing to lose track of when you are in a strange place. The middle aged woman has now come over to me and is explaining that they are both doctors and that this is there day off an they are adults and can be inebriated if they want. Keep in mind all of this is in slurred speech. I hear the man call her into the room and I follow here. I see him sitting on the couch writing out a check...in pencil. With out even looking up at me he asks me, ""Pussy!"" He went on to proceed to tell me that him and his wife are swingers and that if I wanted to I could have sex with her. He claimed that they just finished having sex and that he isn't as young as he used to be. So if I wanted to I could do it before there other swinger friends came by in about 20 mins. 

As I said I was shocked. All I could do was chuckle nervously. At this point he was done writing the check and had handed it to me. I believe I told him ""No"" but all I can remember is that I just kept nervously laughing. They thanked me for the pizza with a weird smirk and told me I could exit through the back door. Thankfully I never had to go back there.  But in my 2 years delivering that was by far the weirdest thing that ever happened to me. 

tl;dr on a random delivery I got propositioned by a not so attractive middle age couple of swingers. I was told I could have sex with the man's wife before there other swinger friends arrived. needless to say, shit scared out of me, laughing.

I'm delivering in city #1 and she lives in city #2 where we don't deliver but i didn't notice this until later. Anyways she tells me that last time she ordered she said no olives and we put olives on her pizza and said that the manager said her order was half off text time. Well I check on the computer and don't see anything on her account saying she gets half off. i check our complaint log book and still don't see anything so i get my shift manager and she ends up just giving her the half off and finishes taking her order. As soon as she hangs up the phone our power goes out so we are unable to make her order until the computers are back up. 30 minutes later when the computers are back up i realize she isn't in our delivery range and decide to be nice and just take it out instead of calling her back half an our later telling her she needs to order from the store in the other city where she's at.

15 minutes later her order is ready to be taken out. i get in my car and drive off and decide I'm going to call her and just let her know of the whole power situation and just letting her know why her food is late. So i call her and she starts yelling at me saying im lying to her and I'm actually out smoking weed with my friends instead of taking her food to her. (yes, drive back to my store and my shift manager is on the phone with her. When she gets off the phone she tells me to go take the order back out, that she explained to this lady that every thing i said was the truth and i wasn't lying and tells me she will give me double mileage.

So i take it out again and I'm about a block away from her apartment and she calls me, i might as well just drop it off."" 

Well i get into the apartment lobby and notice i need a door code which they didn't give me so I'm like ""oh great now i have to call them again"" So i call them and she answers and says ""Ummm, are you kidding me? Do you want to food or not?"" And she yells ""I don't know if i want it anymore.""

Now please keep in mind that I'm not someone who easily get angry or ever talks like this but when she said that something just set off in my head and i lost all control. I said ""You fucking cunt, im coming down there and im going to fucking deal with you"" and i say ""fuck you and your ""girl"" is a bitch."" So I'm kinda having a full blown panic attack at this point and im fearing that this guy's going to come down and beat me up or something so i hang up and just run out of the building. 

Half way back my manager calls me and say's ""what's going on?"" Still furious i kinda yell at her and say ""im done with this job, just come back to the store.""

I get back to the store and my shift manager is on the phone with her crying and when she gets off the phone i asked her ""what did they say?"" and she just says ""that that lady was just crazy and is going to be black listed and not to worry about being fired

That was my last shift until our payday. Payday comes around and i go to the store and it's just my general manager there so i get my check and she tells me that she has to fire me.

 Kitchen at a pizza joint was damn near the worst job I ever had. But I got at least one good story out of it...

A little background first- This was a family-style, but for some reason I seem to catch more shit from him than anyone else [possibly because I was the smallest person working in the kitchen]. I've already been there eight hours, elbow-deep in dishes with the broad side of the oven running full-blast 5 feet behind me, it's August in Oklahoma City [if Hell has a Bonus Level, it's OKC in the summertime], and I am *thoroughly* done listening to him bitching about my failure to do the work of three people [just 'cos you're running on coke, doesn't mean the rest of us are. Well...anyway
To continue-

  It's an hour or so until we close and the incoming dishes are piled high and I'm practically shoveling shit in one end and yanking it out the other. Then, sauce splatters all over the tray of clean pans I'd just pulled out and it misses my head by about three inches on the rebound!

Oh

Now this shift leader was a 6'+, and I [at this point] am a skinny little whiteboy, just barely old enough to drink. I grabbed the first thing that came to hand -which just happened to be a [formerly] clean, small pie pan- spun around and let it fly as hard as I could. It sailed dead straight, about 20-25 feet across the kitchen &amp; nailed him smack in the throat. He immediately drops to the floor gagging &amp; clutching his throat and I yell- ""You're lucky it wasn't a goddamn tray of knives coming out, ya fuckhole! Throw some more shit! Come on! Get up and throw some more shit at my clean dishes!!!""

The entire kitchen froze...I stood there for a moment

The best part? Store manager saw the whole thing.
Zero repercussions.

**TL;DR - Shift leader fucked up my dishes

*epilogue*: He was fine
Then he pretty much went straight back to being an ass.  
I quit in the middle of my shift two weeks later -after getting the ""You're hired! Come pee in a cup!"" phone call while I was out the back door on a smoke break.  I tossed my apron into the kitchen

**Homecoming night 1999**

For medical reasons I had to drop out of college my freshman year.  After working the summer at a camp I had worked at the year prior I landed a job at a pizza joint in town.  This was my first gig as a driver and I was young (19)

I volunteered to work a pair of doubles the week of homecoming.  Being a college town I knew we were going to be busy and being too young to party-hard I decided to work and earn a few extra bucks.

I went in early to fold boxes and get all my ""other duties"" taken care of. As soon as 4:00 hit I was off like a mad man.  Unlike most of the other drivers who were all college students

Anyway, and I left.

At the time we had a deal for college students that was a pizza

**SAME FREAKING GUY**

""Uh

I just laughed

About two hours later I see the same address pop up and cued it on my next run.  I ring the doorbell...

**SAME FUCKING DUDE**

I honestly have no idea how this guy was standing.  He offered me a beer which - sadly - I declined.  He insisted... I declined again saying I drove for my job and couldn't risk it.  He insisted again... I declined again saying I was 19 and wasn't legal.

Anyway

I should also mention at this point that when I made the 3rd delivery I could see the prior two orders sitting right where this guy had put them.  First box was still on the counter next to the door and the second pizza box was still on top of the refrigerator near the window.  No idea if the pizzas were still in them

+++

**TL;DR:** Made three runs to the same house party... same guy answered the door. Kept getting drunker and drunker and saying people kept steeling his pizzas.  Spotted first two orders right where he put them when he gave me the money.  At least he tipped me $5 each time.",,t5_2uh13,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/149y4l/homecoming_night_1999_story_1/

First 2 went off without a hitch and the last was to one of those high-rise flats that are usually full of scumbags. So standard procedure I got lucky and got a parking spot right outside the flat

As I was walking out the fron door I got a bit confused as I was sure I parked my car right there... But it was gone, some screwdriver type thing and tried to plant it in my face, the adrenaline was pumping and I saw it in slow mo so managed to avoid it but at this point I'm thinking, shit this ain't worth it so I let go and he swerved out into the road taking out the side of another car in the process.

So at this point I'm in the middle of the road holding an empty pizza bag thinking hell... My boss ain't gonna buy this one. I made the call and he had another driver come out and pick me up and take me home.

Last week, something was off.  I had ordered pizza, breadsticks, and some extra ranch dressing to go with the breadsticks.  When I checked the food, however, the ranch was nowhere to be found.  I tried to catch the delivery guy, but he was already driving away.  No big deal

After 15 minutes or so, he's already driving away.  I didn't want to call the store again (I felt bad complaining), so I just drove to the store myself.  The store is located just up the road from where I live, so it doesn't take long to get there.  I go inside and the employees apologize and swap out the garlic butters for ranch.  I thank them and go back home.  

I finally get home and I prepare to eat.  However, so I decide to let it go.  I open the pizza box and discover that one garlic butter was inside the box.  Unfortunately for me, the seal broke during transport and it had leaked all over inside the box.  I sigh, but decide to just eat the pizza.  It's cold at this point, so I had to microwave it.  It tasted ok, but the experience was so bizarre that I decided I was going to file an issue report via their website.

I felt really awful complaining.  I rarely complain and I didn't want anyone to get into trouble.  I didn't attack anyone in my complaint.  I just wrote out the story and said that I was unsatisfied with my experience.  Part of the complaint was a brief side note about the ranch dressing.  I mentioned that I like to order extra so that I can eat it on days when I don't even order pizza.  The stuff is that good.  

Two days later, the guy apologizes for my recent poor experience with their company.  He says that is definitely not how they do business and they would like to apologize to me.  He presents a pizza box that included a t-shirt and some coupons for free items.  Then he opens up the second pizza box.  It is full of ranch dressing cups!  He says that they read how much I love the stuff and wanted to offer a pizza box full of ranch dressing cups as an apology.  I laugh and say thank you repeatedly.  The delivery guy says that he really loves the stuff, too, so he understands.  We finish our chit chat and he says he hopes to do business again with me in the future.  I say I definitely will and we close our conversation.

I was so blown away by their customer service.  I laughed about the ranch dressing

1373905232.0,1iciav,I was sent to what was almost definitely a robbery/murder/raping/jumping (X-Post from r/letsnotmeet),relytv2,186,33,36,"So I work at a pizza place



Our delivery area includes a few new development ""upper middle class"" cookie cutter neighborhoods (Bad tips), some trailer parks (Great tips or no tips), and a bunch of rural areas (Usually good tips). Not rural to the point seeing hundreds of stars at night, but enough that you couldn't hear your neighbors yell. 



So about a week ago I was covering a delivery shift, and check to see if I have anymore deliveries. I have one to an address I have never seen before (we have mostly semi regulars get deliveries so an address that doesn't seem the least bit familiar is odd) its out on one of the more rural roads, I ask the kid who took the order what was up because there were special instructions on the ticket. He says, ""They said go around back because the front door is not operational."" I'm like ok that's not *that* uncommon, people often want you to go around back, either they painted the door, the house shifted and its a bitch to open



So as I'm driving out to the house and I get an odd feeling



As I am driving to the house I realize its towards the end of this road that gets less populated the further down you go, I think, ""that house better not be it"" so I drive passed and check the next houses' address and lo and behold, that abandoned looking one was the right house....*shit*. At this point I am not super worried though because out in the boonies the standards of upkeep on your house are pretty low so a house in disrepair isn't unusual. 



So I double back to this house and pull into the drive way



While I am on the phone I take a chance to take a good look at the house. It looks extremely abandoned and not just in disrepair. The driveway is crumbling, no car, no lawnmowers, no landscapaing, no kids toys, absolutely nothing in the yard. The yard hasn't been mowed in what looks like years, the house is total crap, the siding *is* falling apart



At this point I am starting to get pretty nervous, but I did take karate for 10 years, so I'm not helpless, but I do try to avoid any sort of confrontation I can as I am mostly a pacifist. I'm not too concerned about getting robbed, no skin off my teeth its not my money. I mean I would rather not get robbed, but I'm mostly worried about getting jumped, or killed, but more worrying a few stabbings and assaults. 



So its time to either nut up or shut up. I'm not just going to go charging in there like a fool so I get out my phone and call the number they gave when ordering



I am starting to walk up to the house while the phones ringing; it rings twice and then an automated message comes on. It says something along the lines of this phone number is associated with a internet texting app (one the free ones you download and let you send free texts from a different phone number over a data connection) I think it was Heywire. We have had issues with people using numbers from those services for pranks in the past. 



This is huge red flag, with a hat pulled low and big sunglasses on is looking out. Remember he is in a completely dark house surrounded by trees, at dusk, there is no reason for him to be wearing sunglasses, I also see what appears to be a big guy standing behind him in the room, this could have been anything though. When he sees me looking me mouths something and he darts away presumably towards the allegedly broken front door. At this point I noped the fuck out. I had stayed pretty close to my car so it was only a few steps away so I jumped into the driver's seat and throw the pizza into my passenger seat, something I would never do since I am really anal about keeping my car clean. I slam it into reverse, again something I never do. 



Without looking I simultaneously slam and lock my door, the screen door on the outside of the front door is now open but the front is still shut. The guy isn't out in the yard yelling wait come back or anything, he's just gone. So I pull over a little ways up the road to call back to shop and tell them I'm all good and I'll elaborate when I get back. 



The people never called back to inquire about their food, but it was still very unnerving, that I easily *could have* gotten into some serious trouble by just doing my job. Especially if the idiots picked a slightly less abandoned house to set up at.





Sorry for the for a relatively minor incident being so long



TL;DR I got sent on a delivery to an abandoned house

**Pistol-whipped to death**

During my second stint as a driver in my mid 20s a friend invited me to a friend of theirs Halo party.  Apparently this was a weekly thing where eight of them got together for some 4v4 action and some free-for-all death-matchs.  Having rocked Goldeneye for the N64 in college I figured I could pick up Halo pretty easy.

So after my shift is over I threw a pizza through the oven for myself (*perk of being a driver is my manager would allow us one free pizza at the end of our shift so long as we didn't waste too many toppings*). I figured a free pizza would be a nice token gesture for the host of the Halo Party and allowing my friend to invite me along.

Free pizza apparently equals instant popularity.

Being good at N64 games apparently equals nothing on the XBox.

When asked what my skills were I said I was pretty good with FPS games but was new to Halo.  A few minutes into the first round it was obvious I sucked.  End of the first round it was ""PizzaGuy: 0 kills - 15 deaths.""

The next round the 'pros' took to 'pwning' the 'no0b' by pistol-whipping me to death.  It was bad enough to get shot to death every round. It was even more humiliating to have zero kills and die 20+ times in a round without having been hit by a single bullet.

I was still a good sport about it.  I kept bringing the free pizza... they kept pistol-whipping me to death.  Finally after like four or five sessions I finally got my first kill.  They actually paused the game

A few more sessions and I got the hang of it and was registering an even K2D ratio.

Finally, a few celebratory beers, and a slice of free-pizza we went back to play.

For good measure I pistol-whipped the no0b a few times... Welcome to Halo Party night.",,t5_2uh13,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/14jv5u/pistolwhipped_to_death_for_free_pizza_story_7/

I work for Dominos, extra free shit, etc. Basically NOTHING a customer does is wrong in the eyes of Dominos.

I went to a house with two maybe ten year old girl answering the door. It's one of girl's Mom's credit card. Minors shouldn't sign for their parents card without permission legally even
The little girls were laughing as soon as they opened the door.

""We ordered an hour ago

""You ordered 28 minutes ago according to the ticket

""No you were supposed to be hear at 4:30

I see this before I've given her the food


""My Mom gave me this to give to you

The second little girl then runs out of the house to the front of the drive way and yells ""RUN AWAY YOU WIMP!""

I was going to be nice and ask if there was a mistake because the girls demanded I was an hour late. I really just wanted the parents to get aware of how they treated me and pocketed the three dollars.

Nothing.  

I then call the number associated with the order, what address I'm looking for, what time it is, and so on.  I hang around for about 2-3 minutes hoping for a call back, that never arrives.  As I'm starting to head back to the store, I get a wild hair to try something.  I always hate returning to the store with undelivered pizza because usually you still have to go back out when the idiot calls back.  So I decide to try the address on some nearby streets (tricky to get to because of how they're laid out), and lo and behold on the third street over I find what I'm looking for.

I bounce up to the door with a swing in my step because of the miracle I've just pulled off.  The wrong address, and they are thoroughly unimpressed, and proceed to draw a line through the tip line on the receipt and tip me a gratuity of exactly $0.00.

I was seriously baffled at this.  They were so lucky to actually receive their pizza after giving us the wrong address (online order)

Monday afternoon, pancakes. At a pizza store. I politely told her no, and she thanked me for my time and hung up. My manager told me that was a first time a customer tried ordering pancakes at our store.

At my store, my co-worker is inside dealing with a customer, and my manager is just chilling, sitting next to me. This woman, maybe in her late 40's, early 50's, comes up to the table outside. I ask her if she would like to try a sample. She tells me wants to order a slice of pizza. A bit of silence goes by and my manager is just watching this go down. Finally I figure out she was trying to place an order with me and I'm a little dumb-struck. I tell her that she needs to go inside to order. After she leaves

Last story happened to my co-worker. He was working as a cashier and a customer places an order for a personal size cheese-pizza. We hand out local-employee discounts for anyone located in the strip-mall we're located at and she requests said discount. She says she works at the sun-glasses vendor just on the other side of the food-court. No one knows what she is talking about. My co-worker says ""What vendor?"" She then flips the fuck out and starts yelling at him and saying that she is going to write a bad review online if she doesn't get her discount. My co-worker is speechless and doesn't know what to do. While she's still screaming her head off, and gives her the discount. All 40 cents of it.  ",,False,,t5_2uh13,False,,

Tonight: Shit Got Weird. ,forgotpasswordagain0,184,32,38,"It started out as any normal delivery that I'm used to so far in my short existence as a delivery guy. Delivery expert. Whatever. 

I had to go to a block of apartments that sit right on the border of the suburb furthest away from the store. ""Good"", play some music, etc etc - the reason I love this job. There was stormy weather, and while the sky was only partly cloudy, lightning still occasionally illuminated the world around it for a flash of a second.

In retrospect

I get to where I have to go

Okay

I go to the rear, I thought. I bell apartment 68  and there's no response. This sounds like bullshit but I swear to god, there was just some weird low vibrating noise with this raspy noise over the sound of it. Maybe they killed a horse and taped it's last words, I don't fucking know. I shrugged it off. 

Eventually

I get into the elevator and look at the floor layout. Apartment 68: Floor 13. Good fucking sign of things to come.

I swear

I get to the apartment and knock. Before my hand even leaves the door it gets violently pulled open and a puff of dust comes out of the space where the chain lock is attached to the wall. through the small gap of the door that's open I can see a girl about 17 years old looking at me. Someone says something from inside the apartment in another language

She starts screaming at the other person

""the pen is by the sink""

""no the sink""

""ITS RIGHT FUCKING THERE"" 

She gets it

I get back to the elevator and then I hear ""COKE""! 
""COKE WE ORDERED COKE!""

She runs into the elevator where I am and almost puts her hands up to pin me by the shoulders. Then she stops herself. Awkward pause.

Damn it all, before she goes back into the elevator. 

I shit you not, ""where are you going? come back with me"" and the guy flinched and made this face like he really didn't want to be there, but she sort of half-serious half-jokingly threatened him with the rolling pin and he reluctantly gets back into the elevator.

The last I saw of her was her eyes staring at me as she stood completely still and looked at me with discontent

The second order was in another block of flats

I was only on for two hours tonight

Not even remotely amused, since I'm pretty sure these dudes are just fucking with me. As I walk away, the first guy very earnestly says, ""No, get back here, that order's ours, seriously!"" I tell him if he can't give me either the room number or the name on the order, ""Can I place an order with you, ""We'll see you again in about 45 minutes when you come back to deliver our pizza!""

She basically told me that if we were still open, then she replied ""Aren't you open until 1am?"" to which I said ""We stop taking orders at 1245am and it's 1245 right now, you're asking me to put everything back together, pull out stuff that we have put away for the night, so I can make 15 pizzas right away.

UPDATE: Turns it out it was a setup. The area managers were calling all their stores late to put in large orders right before close to see what would happen, I have completed as much of my training on my own that I can complete and the rest is up to them to finish it with me so that I can get restaurant certified, until then I am not supposed to be running shifts alone because I am ""in training"". I have on more than one occasion reminded my general manager that I would like to finish my training, and it has yet to happen. I still get paid the training wage and I have been a shift manager for a few months now, I've been running shifts on my own only after a week or so of training. I was told that we required a 72-hour notice for orders of 15 pizzas or more. I'm upset that this would happen because I consider myself a good manager, I take pride in what I do, and I do my best to do the best job I can. If they want to come down on me for this, I'll face the music like a man



UPDATE #2: I no longer work for PJI, I would love to see you do what I did for them for 8.50 an hour. I come in early, stay late, most of the time I do this off the clock.

This was in the middle of the Saturday evening rush, trying to keep up with the rush, while I plodded along, taking my time, meticulously measuring out everything. I used a knife to level off the sauce to make sure she got exactly one spoodle full. I weighed the cheese pinch by pinch, to ensure she got not a single grain more or less than she'd paid. Took great care to spread it evenly over the thing. Then I went through each topping, weighing each one to the gram, to the point of counting the bit per slice to ensure that each would be as close as I could make. Finally

Over the other side, making light impressions to guide the final cut, so I could get it as accurately centred as possible. The only way I could have been more precise was if I'd used a protractor or something, which I did contemplate briefly. This thing was one of the best pizzas I'd made. My franchisee was there at the time and wished he'd had a camera, as it was so textbook perfect. I boxed the thing up and took it over to her.

At this stage, opened it up and scrutinised it. I saw her teeth clench and could tell she was about to arc up. Before she could open her mouth, I leaned over and told her that I'd made that pizza to exact specifications, weighing each individual topping to ensure that she didn't get a single gram less than she'd paid for.

Backstory: In high school, so at least 3 years).  Dude would 'float' money from the till, some times hundreds of dollars for a week or 2.  He didn't care what we did, as long as we did enough work to keep customers off his back and didn't step on his toes with his shady dealings, he was pretty cool with us.  Names have been changed to protect to protect the innocent

Anyway, free pizza and soda whenever I wanted--on or off the clock.  It was a sweet job and I didn't want to ruin it.  Also, amazingly no one was hurt, so that was good enough for me.

So, a driver (Mac) comes in and says he's selling.  Dude whips out a Harold and Kumar size bag of weed (Not quite [this big](http://i.imgur.com/4XBFF.gif), but if memory serves, it was at least [this big](http://concernedbutpowerless.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/kumar_1.jpg)).  Mac was not the most intelligent person and would frequently come in and tell stories that started with ""so I was high on acid/pcp/mushrooms and ________"".

There will be more stories to come as I get time to recount them.  Not sure how many of them there will be in total, there was very little stress around the shop.

Backstory:
I work for a place in Austin, downtown (mostly affluent highrises, though there is one project tower and we frequently deliver to some service employees that don't tip for shit), and the East Side. The East Side is a total crapshoot; you get the rich white hipsters tipping you big with daddy's money, the older folks in the single-family homes that tip well, project residents that sympathize with your service-sector plight, project residences that don't give a fuck and won't give you a dime.

While nobody really likes going east, and the DM more or less forced us to start accepting deliveires from them.

The particular place this story is about is the Elm Ridge Apartments. It's a large apartment complex, and the customer threatened to stab me because the pizzas were ""cold"" (they weren't). One the way back to the car a man approached me and asked if I was looking for a hook-up. I noped the fuck out of there and told my manager I would not be going back. At least one other driver had a similar experience.

**Background:**  These stories take place on a large college campus that is infamous for being a drunk-party school.  We delivered food extremely late, do it at home.  Don't bring that shit here.""  That same day the store owner was firing a bee-bee gun at an employee in the store.  He purposely missed and hit the giant stack of canned sodas.  Soda was squirting everywhere and the owner had to clean up the mess.  This would by symbolic of our work environment.  At that moment I knew this was going to be the best job i'd ever have... and it was.  

... Like many of my stories, but most of the time it was just the cherry on top.

... So it is 2:30am and the bars have just closed.  I arrive to the next house and call the cell number on the receipt.  I see through the window that the guy is passed out on the couch and his phone is ringing.  I'm not about to drive back to work with this order undelivered

""I need for you to sign the receipt

""Thank you

Perhaps it was because I woke him up or he's drunk

""WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO MY ROOM!!!""

The order I just delivered went FLYING through the window.  I looked inside the window and see my defenseless customer being held in the air by his shirt as the his gigantic roommate runs with him across the room and slams him into the wall.

""WHY DID FLIP EVERYTHING IN MY ROOM UPSIDE DOWN

I look across the street and see one of my delivery colleagues, making a delivery to the neighboring party. Pat is a short and slightly overweight Asian kid with a major affinity for marijuana.  Everyone from the neighboring party is laughing hysterically at this domestic altercation.  

Now, making another delivery across the street to a party.  The Party-goers across the street are scattered in the front yard.

*(This is where the story takes a weird and unbelievable turn

As we're all standing there

Everyone else is stunned.  

Later that night we all met up at the store and have a huge laugh over what had happened that night.  I eventually took a new order back to the original customer that lost his through the window.  It was the least I could do for him giving me a good tip.  From that day on

But you didn't come here to hear about how great a job being a pizza guy so

Most of our business came from catering to local businesses, company outings, golf fund raisers, etc. We had one HUGE pizza delivery to a local country club that was hosting a swim meet for all of western new york. There were going to hundreds of kids and thousands of people, so they ended up ordering about 25 Large pizzas to be delivered on Saturday and then again on Sunday.

We're normally pretty lightly staffed, and go on my way. I get called into work the next day to do the second delivery, because they're really busy and the scheduled driver is already behind.

So, and load up 25 more large pizzas that the rest of the staff came in early to make. I get them in my car drive over there, and actually can park reasonably close to the pool. As I start unloading the pizzas, I notice that there is only 10-15 people at the pool and none of them seem to be doing any sort of organized activity. This was stark contrast to yesterday when there was a sea of people.

As I get the last pizzas setup on a table, and goes to grab the pool manager. The pool manager comes out and informs me that there is indeed no party today, and they did not order the pizzas. I call the pizzeria to explain the situation, and it turns out the original person who took the order wrote it up but didn't tell anybody, and when they called back to make some adjustments another order was written up, because we had no record of the first.

So I load all the pizzas BACK into my car, not to mention the fact that I got no tip/payment because the delivery was faked.

We end up letting the staff take a pizza each and then gave some away to the next few customers that came in. I grabbed about 5 and dropped them off at my other job (Best Buy) on the way home

The place i worked at had a deal on Mondays for a large 1 topping pizza with a large drink. It came to $7.16 out the door. We would make bank on Mondays

Well one Monday i couldn't avoid this order. This was from a regular that lived on the very farthest edge of our delivery area in a seedy part of town and never ever tipped. Ever. Not even the change. He ask for all his money back down to the penny every time. And the dude had money, the orders would have come and gone,so not only am i going to not be tipped, I'm going to lose out on a lot more money just making this order. This greatly upset me. All the drivers were sick of this clown and his penny pinching ways! So i decided to get some revenge.

Did i mention its late fall

So i drop off my other 2 orders and Mr.Regular is last of course. I take his pie and wedge it up under the passanger side windshield wiper and start my trip to his house in the ass end of nowhere. I pull it about a mile from his house and its ice cold. Now there's no way he's going to accept this super icy ice cold box. Being the quick thinker that i am i put the pie on passenger side floor and blast the floor heat. It should be noted that the heater in a 87 Honda Civic should have a setting called blast furnace. I get to his house
Head up to the door, ""Thanks man. Much appreciated."". On the surface I'm thanking him for the business but we both understood i was thanking him for nothing.

Well by the time i get back to the shop, whats up with this guy? Says his pizza is cold."" I told the owner, ""You know what? Fuck that guy. He lives on the edge of our delivery area and he never tips. Not ever. And he didn't tip when i went out there, so he should be happy he's getting a $7 pizza.""

Yesterday, I'm on the phone with this woman and trying to understand what she's saying and I'm having just a horrible time figuring out what the hell she wants to eat. She's mumbling like Ozzy Osbourne and what she's saying just doesn't make sense.

She finally decides that she wants some wings and a root beer. So I ask for her phone number to look up her address in the computer. ""I can't give you my phone number,"" and hangs up.

So S comes back and I'm telling her about this lady. Turns out that she's bat-shit crazy. She thinks that the government is tapping into her phone calls and watching what she does. She goes around town telling people that her husband was a federal agent (he worked in town all his life at the local mills) and that her son is in the CIA (unconfirmed). I guess a lot of the guys in the shop will refuse to take her order and if she calls they'll start pressing buttons on the phone so she thinks her phone is being tapped into. S said this lady calls in all the time, buy her a milkshake, and deliver it.

Last night was one of those nights were I worked in the day, and he told me this story about one particular deliver to her house:

He said that when he walked in the apartment smelled like cat piss (supposedly this is not uncommon for this woman). He put the pizzas down and was awaiting her payment when she spoke up and told him to make sure the government doesn't take his guns away, makes a gun with her fingers, points directly at him and says, ""BANG!

(Story #10),sn44,126,16,34,"*So my last story was kinda heavy/serious and I am sure a few people are pissed off and will let me know it via a flood of heated comments.  I decided to balance that out with a levity.*

**Story #10: My most awkward deliveries ever... Back-to-back deliveries to a swingers’ orgy at a hotel**

This is the story of my two most awkward deliveries I ever had.  They were back-to-back delivers to a local hotel suite that was occupied by a bunch of swingers having a full on BDSM &amp; fetish-play orgy.

Midway through my shift I have to stop by one of the local hotels to drop off an order.  Not uncommon so I thought nothing of it.  I lived in a small rural farm town that was right off the interstate so there was a lot of through traffic.  We set up special deals with most of the hotels in town and it equated to a lot of orders.

Anyway, etc.  I’ve done my fair share of weird things in a hotel (*different stories for a different subreddit*) so I am not one to judge.  So I knock on the door matching the order number.  My first thought was that I was thankful it was not the room that all the weird noises were coming from.  I was just about to feel sorry for the occupants when the door opened.  I instantly went speechless.

Standing in front of me was a man in his late 40s or even early 50s in full black leather BDSM garb.  He was also wearing a collar which had a leash that was held by a big, which he does while barking like a dog, and then hands it to me.  I was so thankful he didn’t use his mouth or ‘fetch’ the money from some unpleasant place on his master’s body.

At this point these are the only two people I see.  I count the money, and then I **GET THE FUCK OUT** as fast as I can.

I get back to the store ready to tell my crazy store when the manager hands me an order.  I recognize it as the hotel and ask if there was a problem.  He comments that there was no problem it’s just the people *“worked up more of an appetite than they thought.*” I about threw up in my mouth when he said that.  Again

Reluctantly I get back in the car and head back to the hotel.  The guy at the desk gave me a knowing look and we had a moment of shared sympathy as I walked past.

When I opened the door the next time a different woman answered it in - *you guessed it* - some form of leather BDSM garb.  The thing was her tits were fully exposed.  If I had to guess I would say she too was in her late 40s early 50s.  Without being too graphic let’s just say gravity was not a kind mistress to her at all.

No joke she says

The worst part is behind her is a guy in a horse mask (*if I’m lying I’m dying*) being ridden by a older chick in leather chaps --- and nothing else.  The mean age of the two rooms had to be 50 something.

Keep in mind: small rural farm down.  That’s what I grew up in.  This kinda stuff was supposed to be ‘fantasy porn’ type stuff.  Not small town hotel stuff… well, that’s all.

Oh

So anyway

Having been working there around a year, I started to show her the ropes.  As we were preparing for the dinner rush, I heard some yelling from the other side of the store.  When I looked over, I saw the girl standing by the drink cooler, pointing at me and yelling ""Hey! Hey you! Boy!""

I stared at her for a few seconds, I told her something to the effect of 'You know, if you want to get my attention, just say my fucking name'.  Her response: 'I don't know it'.  After another few seconds of giving her the &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;, I reminded her of my name and went back to work.

This happened 2 or 3 more times that night, I told all the other employees to say my name anytime they talked to me, whether or not we were in the middle of a conversation.  She still didn't catch onto my name.  I felt like Homer Simpson trying to get Mr Burns to remember his name.

I decided to get my revenge on my way to work the next day.  I got everyone, she was girl, sparky, sport, 'hey you', and any other nickname we could come up with.  We were going to continue this as long as it took for her to learn my name.  At one point, after a few days of this

For *every* item the mom adds, she double checks with her son and mentions the nutritional value of it. Normally

Yay! We're done with the salad two minutes later. Got all your veggies and meats in there? Good? Great. Now onto the pizza. Wait, we're done with the order. I read their order back to them, read them their total, but wait, they don't want any meats anymore on their salad. OK, no problem. Finally done.

There's this regular customer - let's call him Gump - who calls our store almost nightly. He's living on a disability pension, as well as afford a modern apartment a block away from the riverfront. Still, I'm pretty sure he can't cook for himself, thus the regularity of encountering him.

We know each other by name and we always have a chat. He's perfectly lucid, he just doesn't know how to respond. I think. It's like your car needs to be there for the procedure to click in his head. I'm fairly sure he's agoraphobic. 

He's a really nice guy though. Occasionally he'll tell me this:

""Don't share too much information with people. People start to talk. People are like parrots. They talk and learn one thing and talk and then another one learns it and so on. Just don't tell anyone too much about yourself alright? Promise me.""

- I once delivered to a house that wasn't answering. I went around to a side-door

- I once delivered to a man who I could see sleeping on the couch through the window. I had to knock a good deal to wake him up. When he finally did, and then walked around the living room in a few circles before returning in front of me, staring quizzically. I told him how much he owed me. This happened several times before he finally handed me a check.

- I once delivered in the snow and as I was pulling up to a house, and a few boys my age jumped out. They got behind my car and pushed. My car got unstuck. They then jumped in their car and drove away.

- I once delivered to the high school. There were no instructions for which entrance so at first I just went to the front door, where they were. I jumped in the car, and drove down to them. When I got out, they said, ""Woah! You're really good!"" and then someone asked, ""Is that where you *normally* keep the pizza?"" I was mortified to see the pizza still sitting on the back of my car. I just laughed and said, ""Uh ... don't tell anyone about that."" I am so lucky it didn't fall off!

- I once got to a house and was told by the people there that they hadn't actually ordered because it was too expensive so they told the phone girl to cancel it and ordered from Pizza Hut. I just gave them their dinner for free. I guarantee they ate our pizza for dinner that night -- so much better than Pizza Hut (but

- So often, ""Pizza guy's here!"" and then after opening the door, ""Oh! Pizza girl!""

- I once delivered to a taxidermy shop. I didn't know it was one until I got there. Three people called me inside and they were all busy gutting (or whatever) a deer. They asked if they could pay me in deer meat. I had to bring the pizza in and set it down because their hands were ... busy.

- I once delivered to a place with a super long, but somehow veered and little and smacked into a fencepost. I was horrified. As I pulled forward, I saw the fencepost was bent and had splintered! My stomach was churning. I kept backing out, not knowing what the do. I finally called the customer and told him I thought I had hit his fence. I was so relieved when he laughed and said the fence has been like that for years. Phew.

- I was working the night of the last presidential election and that was probably one of the most fun nights I had. Every person I delivered to wanted to talk about it, and getting some pizza to accompany them. :)

- I usually left my car running (though I wasn't supposed to). Once, which I didn't realize until I'd gotten back to my car. My cell phone and everything was in the car. I sheepishly rang the guy's doorbell again and explained and he let me use his phone to call the store, and then my mother (spare key was at home). The guy lived alone and was moving the following day. He had only a TV and two fold-up chairs. He had me sit in one and we watched TV together. I offered a gift certificate for free pizza, but he said since he was moving he didn't want it and it was no big deal anyway. I was super embarrassed and this guy was so nice. When my mom called his cell phone to talk to me, he said, ""It must be for you. Nobody's going to call me."" I felt terrible for him, as he talked about working the night shift and how his wife had left him. When my mother finally arrived with my spare key

It was about two summers ago, my weekend had begun. I show up to the house... it's in a nice neighborhood on the end of a cul-de-sac. 

I ring the doorbell and an extremely drunk twenty-something year old answers the door. Clean cut guy

Guy greets me with a ""FUCK YEAAAAH! PIZZA'S HERE!"", and I asked. But dude assures me that it was only him and his girlfriend, but they needed to get to a party the next town over, but they were too drunk to drive, as they had pre-gamed a little bit too hard.

He gets the look in his eye as if he'd just gotten the most brilliant idea in the world. ""Oh my god... Dude, eat some of the food I brought them, and we load up all the alcohol and hit the road. 

We get to this party and it is absolutely out of control. 50 some-odd people in the street and front yard, or I could see where this night was going to take me. I decided on the latter.

I enter this party and already feel kind of awkward. I don't see a single person I know, drinks, long conversations with strangers, making new 'best friends', etc. etc.

Cue 1am. Things are rowdy. Fights have broken out already, and was barely coherent. He was upstairs hanging out around the balcony when suddenly, he completely keels over and falls OVER the balcony right onto the motherfucking coffee table and completely smashes the entire thing. His girlfriend is FREAKING out thinking he is dead, until he gets up. Brandon thinks someone pushed him over the balcony and becomes extremely belligerent and is trying to pick fights with anyone he sees. He gets into it with another guy about his size.  A few punches are thrown until someone breaks it up. Brandon's girlfriend is LIVID and gets into a huge screaming match with him and tells him that she's leaving. At this point, I'm not sure what to do as these are the only two people I 'know' at this party. I lose track of Brandon and I'm just hanging out by the door on my cell phone figuring out what to do and where I'm gonna go when Brandon's (ex?)girlfriend grabs me and asks me if I can give her a ride home. But this wasn't your casual ""Oh can you give me a ride home."" This was a pissed off vengeful woman wanting me to go home with her. But I hadn't been in this situation before, so I couldn't tell the difference.  Me, being young and naive agree to drive this girl home. I drove Brandon's girlfriend back to her apartment and she invites me in (this is when things started clicking inside of my 17 year old head). I timidly agree, all I'm thinking is ""Okay. What the fuck is going on. How am I in this situation? Why did she want me to come inside? I DON'T EVEN KNOW THIS GIRL!""

I tell him I don't have change for it but he tells me it's all he has. This is were my dipshit noobieness kicked in and I tell him let me check my wallet.

**Why I never had to worry about DUI checkpoints for the longest time.**

As I mentioned before my dad is a volunteer firefighter in town and for a short while took his turn to be police commissioner.  There really wasn't much for him to do as the commish but one thing on his list was organizing DUI checkpoints with his department

I had just made a run to a no-show and was already a bit pissed off.  Just one of those nights that nothing seemed to be going my way.  So when I realized I got caught in the line for a DUI checkpoint I was pissed.  It was early (like 10pm) but they were doing their thing.  When I pulled up I saw my dad standing in the background.

When I was next in line I rolled my window down and called out to my dad.  ""You eat yet?""

""Yeah

""Had a no-show at my last address.  Got a large pizza. Wondering if if you wanted it.""

He thought for a second. ""Give it to me anyway. I am sure someone here will eat it.""  I gave him the pizza and he told the officer to just wave me through.

Later that night my cell rang and it was my dad.

""Hey

I told him I would take care of it.

Half our later I show up in the DUI checkpoint line

Anyway

For about a year or so after that every time where was a DUI checkpoint I would get waved though even if I wasn't working.  Not that I was a heavy drinker or anything nor ever drove drunk.  It was nice just to get waved around as soon as one of the officers or troopers spotted my car.

Sadly after I sold that car I was no longer recognizable until the last second and they saw my ID.  It was nice while it lasted.",,t5_2uh13,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/14gl3t/why_i_never_had_to_worry_about_dui_checkpoints/

1354740708.0,14cc7x,Pledge Week 1999 (story #2),sn44,115,23,21,"*This is the second story from my days as a teenage pizza boy in a college town.*

**Pledge Week 1999**

As many of you know Fraternities and Sororities love to make their pledges do interesting things during Pledge Week.  Although I could bore you with stories of what the frats made some of their pledges do

I was till pretty young at the time (19) and pretty naive.  I won't pretend otherwise.  So I show up for my Friday evening shift at 3:30 and start folding boxes.  Some other drivers like to do this between runs, and bust ass for a half hour.

Once 4:00 hits I start making runs.  Friday nights were usually about 60/40 split between college students and local orders.  I was a little surprised when every single order on my first run had me going to ""frat row.""  There was small cul-de-sac of apartment buildings that had been taken over my fraternities and sororities.  Wasn't uncommon for them to order pizzas for their parties but it seemed a bit early.

First drop off was a frat.  I was a little weirded out when a kid no older than I was answered the door in his tighty-whities.  His frat brothers were all huddled around the corner laughing their ass off.  I took the poor kids money and walked away.

Next drop off was just around the corner so I didn't even move my car.  Just grabbed the pizza warmer bag and walked over.  I knocked on the door and a chick about two

""Oh

I pulled out the slip

""I mean

Like an idiot I stood out front for about a minute before I was ready to write this order off as a prank call.  At least I would have a pizza to eat.  Just as I was about to walk away the door reopened.

My jaw hit the ground.  Here stood a statuesque blonde in stilettos, garter, and a skimpy bra.  She was just as nervous as the fratboy next door but a hell of a lot easier on the eyes.

I heard some giggling in the background and could only assume her soon-to-be sisters had put her up to this.

Like two kids on prom night we exchanged the pizza and money and soon I was off to make another run.

When I got back to the store I noticed another batch of orders for frat row.  The other driver was a bit older (*and a bit creepier*) so I told my manager that I was more than willing to make all the frat row runs.  Luckily he agreed.

The next run to the sorority I was greeted by a brunette in a stocking/bustier combo.  She was a little more confident than the first girl.

As I was geting back into my car with a cat-got-the-canary grin I noticed one of the sisters running towards me.  I feared I had screwed up the order somehow and mixed up the pizzas.

""Nothings wrong

""Oh

She gave me a coy smile. Not the innocent of 'oh aren't you precious' kind but the 'I'm up to something' kind of smile. ""Blonde

""Excuse me?"" I asked.

""We're going to be doing this all night. So what do you want to answer the door next. A blonde

Up until this point i was still pretty clueless. As clueless as a 19 year old boy could be.  Something in that moment made it click for me and I realized this was all a game.

""Redhead

In a flash she was off half running half skipping towards the door to the apartment building.

So here is where we lather-rinse-and-repate a few times.  I made about a 12 other runs and it was getting late.  I kept checking to see if the sorority house had called again.  I was the first driver to be cut once things slowed down.  That usually happened around 11pm depending on how busy we were.

I finally resigned to the fact that they weren't going to call again.  Most of the other frats and sororities were playing similar games so I was still having a good night

As I was gathering up my next round or orders my manager came over to me with another box.  This one specified that you deliver it.  My eyes lit up and I checked the box.  Yup

This time when I answered the door I was greeted by a girl-next-door type redhead in an emerald green lingerie set.  I have always been a sucker for a redhead and tonight was no exception.

""You're right

Speechlessly I handed her the pizza and mumbled the price of the pizza.  She handed me money and then paused.  ""And this is your tip

Now

Anyway

So I made two more runs that night before my manager lets me know I am cut.  The whole time I am smiling thinking about this number and whether or not it was just part of the game or if I might actually stand a chance at getting a date out of the whole thing (*naive

So I cash out the end of my shift like I usually do.  I then up-change all my tips into big bills.  No need carrying around a wad of $1 and $5 bills when I could carry around a few crips $20s.

I get home

Can't find it.

I rip open my wallet and look at every bill. I double check my pockets.

Can't find it.

I run out to the car and look everywhere I usually stash a buck.

Can't find it.

Shit. Shit. Shit.

I run back into the house

I go up to my manager and ask him if he can open up the cash drawer and let me look through the $1 bills.

""Too late

Shit. Shit. Shit.

If that wasn't bad enough

""Do you deliver pizzas?"" She asked with a bemused look on her face.

""Uh

""I gave you my number didn't I?"" She asked still bemused.

""I lost it

She laughed and then started walking away.  ""Your loss

I could only laugh as I got into my car and drove away.

+++

**TL;DR:** During rush week one of the sororities had their pledges answering the door in lingerie.  After multiple runs to the same sorority house the last girl gives me a $1 bill with her name and number on it.  Like an idiot I cash it in at the end of the night when I up-change all my tips.

1994, there were 2 more deliveries that could be made as a double and the other driver, We'll call him Rectum, was taking them off the oven at the cutting table. The cooks had left and the shift manager was closing the make table. Cutegirl that I had classes with had finished closing the dining room and stopped by the dish sink to say goodnight. I had soap suds up to my elbows and medium deep dish pans stacked to the ceiling, we laughed about how there was no way in hell I was going to get done before 3am. 

She said goodnight and leaned backwards against the crash bar on the door, one stuck a gun right in my face and I went into ""fight/flight"" mode, spun on my heels and realized there was no place to go. 

There was a definite pecking order in the robbers, he looked scared and about to cry. Nig3 tells me to go up front and lay on the floor, Cutegirl is face down on the floor between the make table and the oven with foot prints across her back, Rectum is laying face down on the floor at the cut table and had pissed himself, it reeked of fear and piss.  

I walked past the front register and knelt on the floor in the dining room with my hands laced behind my head

Nig1 was holding a pistol to the shift managers head demanding that he open the safe, that was the longest 10 minutes of my life. 

 The safe was opened, we couldn't get an outside line for another few minutes because the calls were streaming in too fast. Rectum called the police, I lit up a cigarette and sat in a booth. I was almost done smoking when I spotted someone peeking in the corner window, fight/flight took over again and I was diving for cover in the wait station when I remembered all the broken glass from the gun play, that's about the time I realized it was the cops.

So the whole place gets turned into a crime scene

I work at a pizza place that serves by the slice.  Most of our business comes from this.  We do delivery/carry-out, the local population will swell to 3 or 4 times the year-round average.  We also happen to be located on one of busiest streets in town, in the heart of the restaurant/bar district.  And boy, are there a lot of bars.  I'm not exaggerating when I say you could start at one end of the street, have a drink at each bar, and it's very unlikely you'd make it to the other end.

As you can imagine, with 3 being much more commonplace.  Our biggest rush begins around 12:30 AM, and really picks up around 1AM, when the bars close.  During the peak of the season, a line stretching down the street is a fairly common thing for us.  We keep as much pizza in our display case as we can, with even more prepped and ready to go into the oven at a moments notice.  Most people who come in are complacent, just want their slice, however, for some reason


------------------------
So this night starts out like any other; coworkers and I bullshitting, etc.  It's shaping up to be a very average night.  Nothing particularly exciting happens, and the drunks start coming in right on schedule.  The first 10 or 15 minutes goes by without a hitch.  Then, we get a guy wanting to buy 2 boxes worth of pizza.  This is pretty common; we sell by the slice, and let people buy as much as they want (or are willing to pay for).  It's a pain in the ass for us, because it wipes out a good chunk of what we have to sell, and our ovens can only cook so much, we box up what he wants, easy enough to ring him out.  My coworker proceeds to do so

Or so we thought.

Apparently, for some reason, the drunks treat as a gathering point), and promptly stopped paying attention to it.  Apparently, some unscrupulous character noticed this, and took the opportunity to pick up one of his boxes, and walk out of our store.

DIQ is now very pissed off.  So pissed off, and begins yelling at my manager, saying that it's ""our fault that his pizza got stolen.""  My manager doesn't believe this, obviously, and tries explaining to him that once we hand him the pizza, it's HIS responsibility.  This, of course, so I didn't catch most of what he was saying.  DIQ also thought it was a good idea to start hitting our hanging lights with the box

---------------------------

This one happened before my time, but it's for employee use only.  This particular night, a group of drunks comes in, and a girl asks to use the restroom.  We tell her that we don't have a public restroom, sorry.  Drunken girl makes a bit of a scene, but goes about her merry way.  A minute or so later, one of my former co-workers notices her in the corner by the door leading to the restroom/closet.  As he goes to tell her to move away, the girl drops her underwear

At 1AM. 

In the middle of a store with approximately 40 or 50 drunken assholes and overtired employees.  

My coworker, and closes the store so that they could clean up her mess.  It was then that they noticed that not only had Piss-Zilla hit the floor, she had managed to urinate on a good portion of our bottled drinks that went in our cooler; obviously, we can't sell those, so there's a bunch of lost profit.  Now, our store has cameras covering virtually every angle of the shop.  Somehow, this girl had found one of the few blind spots in the system.  She got away scot-free

**Delivering to the undeliverable**

As mentioned in my prior story at one point I drove a Jeep when delivering pizzas.  One day I was working and I saw the owner of the local Jeep dealership coming in to pick up a take-out order.  He recognized me and we started chatting.

I asked him whey he was getting carry-out when he lived so close (*as the bird flies he was only about 5 miles from the store*).  He said that he had been black-listed by every pizza place in town because he lives on top of the mountain and his driveway was about a mile long and all gravel.

I quipped that I would deliver to him and his brother any time.  Just call the store and ask for me or call my cell and find out when I am working next.

A few weeks pass and I get a call on my cell.

""Were you serious about your offer to deliver to our place?"" The owner of the dealership asked.

""Yes sir Mr. Owner Man

I finished up the run I was on and walked in to the store.  Manager immediately cornered me.

""Did you say you would deliver to Mr. Owner Man up on the mountain?"" My manager asked me rather sternly.

""Yes. I can handle it.  I know right where he lives

""You sure?"" My manager asked still a little uneasy.

""I drive a Jeep. He owns the Jeep dealership. It's the least I can do for him

My manager realized the connection and told me that I was the only one allowed to run Mr. Owner Man's orders and he would make a note in the computer.  I reassured him that Mr. Owner Man had called me on my cell to make sure I was working and would do so in the future.

I grab the order

Once I got to the top he greeted me

Fast-foward a couple months.  If I recall it was probably a month or so before the big snow storm I talked about in story #4.

There was about 3"" of snow on the ground.  Nothing debilitating.  Just made the main roads slushy and some of the back roads powdery.  Anyway

""Just so you know

""No problem

**First**. There were some local white trash folks that lived in a double-wide down in a development tract off a main road. Lots of cool people down there, and got out of my car ready to deliver. Only to be met by an unrestrained, angry pit bull mix that was charging at me from the back yard. I ran back to my car, dove inside, and slammed the door behind me just before he reached me. He's very, very angry, very, and very, teeth bared

I crack the window. ""Dude

She shrugs. ""I didn't order anything.""

Finally

He comes over to the window of the car. I hand him the sub and side. He hands me $9 for a $8.XX order. ""Keep the change.""

Thanks.

**Second**. One of my friends' aunt was throwing a graduation party for her daughter's high school graduation at a local park. Google Maps says it's 7.9 miles from the shop I was working at. Now

At that point, and I trained him on how to make pizza), so I had the prerogative to say, ""Fuck the rest of you, I'm taking this delivery."" Now, this was after the movie ""Waiting"" came out. But I still made the same mistake that Dean made. ""Hell, this bill's $580.XX. Even if they only tip a pittance, that's almost $60."" 

The day before the big delivery, sorting, and bagging the extra 500 chicken wings for delivery. The morning of the delivery was hot. And if you've ever worked in a pizzeria that's not air conditioned, you know that an 85 degree day outside is 120 inside once the ovens kick on. I was working hard in a true hellhole. I came in early and made two extra batches of dough to cover the added need, then started cooking pizza and wings with the owner and his brother-in-law. I loaded up my car trunk with pizza after pizza, and covered my backseat with boxes and boxes of wings, and finally got en route. 7.9 miles, organizing and setting up the pizza boxes on their tables. Sorting the wings and laying them out nicely. I put down huge stacks of complimentary plates, and make sure that everything's good to go. 

The hostess approaches. Finally

Checkbook. 

I stand over her shoulder as she writes. $5... *Well shit*. $58... *What the fuck?* $580.XX. Exact change. To the penny.

I don't know how I didn't flip the fuck out. I saved it for the entire drive back to the shop. Then I blew my top.

A few days ago, and waited for them to sort themselves out (the mom has bags of shopping to put in the house, both kids are trying to have a conversation with her at the same time, etc).

I noticed that they'd clearly emigrated over to Australia from Britain pretty recently; the mother had a very distinctive British accent. So you can imagine my surprise when in the middle of the conversation, because I heard him revert back to British when speaking with his wife. The kids have something in between. They weren't sarcastic or anything- they were very passable and I wouldn't have picked them as fake accents if I hadn't already heard them speaking to themselves. I didn't call them out on it; I thought it was rather amusing.

It got me thinking, I wouldn't have thought appearing to be British would be much of a problem - here's a few Australian Bureau of Statistics numbers to chew on...

One day

Every so often, slamming the door and talking in hushed tones.  Minute or 2 later, there would be a comped order placed and Brian would get super defensive about the pizza box until it was delivered.  He sold his bag-of-weed pizzas for a while and thought his system was fool proof.

One day, who was not yet privy to Brian's side business, dropped a pizza destined for a group of stoned-looking teenagers who were waiting in the lobby.  Jenna didn't want to keep walk in customers waiting for too long, so she started looking through recently boxed deliveries for a similar pizza.  Brian was distracted by something and wasn't guarding his ""special"" pizza.  Wouldn't you know it, the ""special pizza"" was the same as what the kids had ordered.

Jenna swaps the labels, he grabs his special delivery and heads out.  20 minutes or so later, he comes back absolutely furious.  He was grilling all of our drivers to find out where the weed went.

We didn't know whee it went until later that night

One day, but they were pretty insistent. The person who had the $1.00 on their bill called to cancel. Rather than re-run the remaining card, my boss told me to ask her to add $1.00 to the tip to cover it. 
 
So I get to the school and go to the front desk. The front desk woman is usually the one who orders- she is also the one who doesn't tip. She didn't order this time though. I ask if she knows who ordered, but this was not the case.
 
A little annoying, but also, it would take ten seconds. 
 
I was getting annoyed at this point and I ask her what she can do for me. She basically shrugs me off. So I decide I'm going to have to go door to door in the school to try and find who ordered the food. I leave the office and knock on the first occupied classroom I see. They didn't order and don't know who did. I'm about to talk to the second teacher when the woman from the office shouts down at me that I can't just walk around the school. I tell her that since she's not helping me
 
Luckily the second teacher knew who ordered. The first woman came, then could not get her head around the concept of just putting a dollar in the tip section (in addition to whatever else she wanted to tip, I added optimistically). Spent a good five minutes trying to get this through her head and was on the verge of just paying it myself when she finally relented.

**Of Irishmen and Ketchup**

As I'm sure many of you were aware, then has sloppy drunk pizza to finish off the night.  

As you can imagine, because that's exactly what he was.  PMS, here, was what I like to call ""infinite wallet"" drunk.  You know the type; drunk to the nines, refusing to acknowledge this fact, and spending money like he's the heir to the Guinness brewery.  PMS here decides to buy a whole pizza's worth of slices.  No argument from me; box 'em up,  take the cash, and fuck right off.  

After an initial rush, eating pizza and whatnot.  PMS is FAR more drunk than the rest of them.  He's sitting on a stool, but the way he's moving about on it, it didn't look like he'd be there for long.  I was hoping that his face would have a nice introduction with our tile floors, but it was not meant to be.  

At this point, and by some miracle, conveys that he wants some ketchup.  We, unfortunately for him, do not have ketchup.  I tell him ""Sorry, we don't have any.""

Oh no.

In the most perfectly accented, mate?""  He said it so well, I think even [Brick Top would have been proud.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=WcG3JRIF05w#t=192s)

Unfortunately, though thanks to the heavy dose of heritage and tequila, I can't understand a damn thing he's saying.  I think the general gist of it was ""FUCK YOU MATE, GIVE ME SOME GODDAMN KETCHUP.""  Because, clearly, yelling at me is going to make a bottle of Heinz appear out of fucking nowhere.

PMS and I go back and forth, and lack the processing facilities to create some on a moment's notice.  At this point, PMS' friends have decided to try and calm him down, to no avail.  PMS is still making a scene, and it's at this point that my manager (whom I will refer to as Angela, because anonymity) informs his friends that they need to leave.

Now, girl's scrappy).  PMS had to have been at least 6' 2"", 240lbs of pure, unadulterated, drunken asshole.

PMS does not take kindly to this.  He steps towards Angela, I've decided enough is enough.  I say to him ""You take another step towards her, and I'm calling the cops.""  This had 2 consequences.  First, it got PMS away from Angela, which is what I intended.  Secondly, PMS interprets that as my request for a boxing match.  PMS comes over to where I am behind the counter, and starts shouting about how ""Y'WANA FUCKIN HAVA GO, lights being smacked (seriously

Thankfully, continues shouting about god-knows-what, and with a final ""FUCK YOU,"" leaves.  Once outside, however, PMS decides that rather than finish the pizza he paid for, it would be better off being half-assedly tossed at the window next to me, and earns a solid middle finger from myself.

A few minutes later, and actually goes outside and cleans up the mess that his friend made.  Pretty nice guy, if I say so myself.

 So yesterday was my first day back at since my car was totaled on the job. I had missed a few days of work at this point and was slightly on edge because I didn't know what ""gossip"" or anything my coworkers knew

 It was busy right when I walked in, or google maps, so that was fun to figure out. After talking to a few coworkers about the location, I was on my way just trying to spot the street in a general area I was semi familiar with. It turned out to be a new swimming pool and as I was handing the new customer the food I realized I'd forgotten his salad. I apologized and told him I would be right back with it. As I was leaving, he ran up to me and told me his daughter had dropped one of the pizza's and asked me to call the store to see what we could do. In a panic since I knew we were busy I told him the best thing to do was to call the store himself so he could get the replacement out asap. In a way I was relieved because I had to go get his salad anyway so bringing another pizza made it less obvious that I had messed up. 

 When I get back to the store I'm immediately asked what happened to that pizza, not the customer, because they trust the driver. I told them I understood and tried to explain it was just stress from being back that caused me to work worse than I usually do. I offered to take the pizza and another order close by when they were ready so I just had to wait around the store while it was super busy. The other order I had to take also had a salad that I had to make, but I wasn't told about it by the kitchen until the order was ready so that delayed me even further, causing more condescending looks from my boss. It hadn't started out well.

 The rest of my shift was relatively easy from there, but is the grand scheme of things pretty minor.

 Towards the end of the night (I was closing) I was looking for an opportunity to talk to my boss and act out on some advice I was given from some of the fine people in this sub. On a bit of a dramatic note, I ""thanked"" him for giving me less hours than usual so I could recover, but that I'd like to work more so I can start raising money towards buying a new car (I know insurance will get most of it but this whole thing still makes money tight) and making up for the hours I missed when I was recovering.

The amount owed was wasn't to the dollar, and instead of tipping me a couple of cents, she borrowed some coins off a co-worker

**Drunken Santas and Narcissism at its Finest**

So this one happened just this Saturday.  It was a slow night, there were many drunken fools stumbling around in Santa hats/suits.  Naturally, several of them came in for the staple alcohol-absorbing slice of pizza.  Nothing too remarkable from these fools, aside from one woman who decided to dress up as Zombie Santa, and felt the need to reiterate the fact that she had, in fact, dressed up as Zombie Santa every third sentence.  Annoying

So it's getting towards the time when the rush usually kicks off, and in walks a woman who had to have been in her mid 40's.  What was different about her, though, was that despite the fact that the temperature was in the mid 30's, she was wearing a very tight, short dress, and draped in [a fur coat that was about as ridiculously over-sized as this.](http://i.imgur.com/94BJi.jpg)  It was then that we noticed that she had some 20-something year old dude with her, obviously drunk

Anyways, using the opportunity to point at literally every single one with the intention of showing off the (likely fake) jewelry decorating her wrist.  Princess finally decides what she wants, pays for it, and leaves in relatively calm fashion, though not before striking a few more poses for her paparazzi.  Confusion ensues.

-------------

**Drunken Politics and Pizza**

This happened the weekend following the 2012 Election.  As I'm sure you all know, the rush starts, and it's not a particularly busy night.  A few locals come in, we serve 'em, they linger/leave, and everyone's happy. 

Now, we've got his oompa-loompa cousin.  Imagine [Chevy Chase](http://i.imgur.com/nND4I.jpg) with a spray tan that would make the cast of Jersey Shore jealous, and you've got this guy.

Anyways, ask him how it's going?  This would turn out to be mistake number one.  Cue verbal diarrhea of anti-Obama, pro-Romney blathering.  I ignore the most of it, until he asks me who I voted for.  I try and dodge the question by saying ""I prefer not to discuss politics at work.""  To him, this immediately means that I voted for Obama, and he starts going on about how Obama's ruining the country, socialist, and keep working.

Creepzilla, and it's pretty obvious to anyone with an even semi-functioning gaydar.  Now, Creepzilla asks my manager who he voted for.  My manager says something similar to what I did, with Creepzilla following up with the question ""Well, what's important to you?""  Manager replies with ""My rights as a human being.""

OH **HELL** NO.

Creepzilla proceeds to go on a rant about how human rights were less important to the economy, derp, etc.  Basically, he told my manager that gay rights are the least important thing for this country right now.  

It was here that I almost punched him in the face.  The only thing stopping me was the fact that I do enjoy being employed.  I don't know how my manager didn't leap over the counter and beat his ass into submission.  Literally the most offensive thing I've ever seen/heard

Creepzilla eventually left

**The cougar in 205**

About two months into my time as a driver I started picking up on a pattern of orders every Friday night around the same time to the same apartment.  Pretty much like clockwork around 7:00 and order for a medium veggie lovers

This particular apartment complex was a mix of older college students (*think grad students*) and young working professionals. There were also a few random older people.  Anyway

Most of the time my nights were a blur of delivery after delivery.  Never really remembered places or faces.  However

First time I really took notice of the woman in #205 she looked like she had just gotten from home and changed into something comfortable.  Sadly this was in the days before yoga pants so it was sweatpants and a loose t-shirt.  She was attractive

So we exchanged pleasantries

The following week she answered the door in a pair of tights and a loose shirt.  When she bend over to put the pizza down on the steps behind her I got a nice view of her spandex-covered ass and even a shot up her shirt to some under-boob.

I was kinda distracted but managed to give her a smile

I ended up missing a friday shift the following week

Like before she bent over and placed the pizza on the steps behind her. This time I got a flash of bare ass.  Sadly it was too dimly lit to see much else.  However

I just stood there like a deer in headlights.  At this point I was 19

I deliver pizza here in the UK. For various reasons

Near the end of the night, total comes to £21.20. Fair enough, I think, and I prepare £3.80 change as they're going to likely give me £25 (but I have an extra fiver in case of £30). I always assume they won't tip because this is in the UK and is a whole other topic.

So I go there and the guy gives me £40 (2 x £20)

What the hell. I'm not a walking till, you know.

Fine, I say. I get back, another delivery. I take it and when I return to the store, I remember the first guy needs his change. So I go there, give him his change (""no, it's no bother, have a great night!"") and get back.

A few hours later, but alas, it's me who has to take it. Thankfully, it's paid, but I can't help thinking ""this is the third time I've gone to this house in an evening...""

As I get closer to the restaurant

Now

*But never do police.*

By now

I walk back to the kitchen where the orders that are ready to be delivered are, and my ex-girflriend also lived in that neighborhood, so the guards knew me pretty well).

I pull up to the guard shack and I see one of my favorite guards. 

I roll down my window, with a very straight face, waives me on. I begin to think that this is odd, but I shrug it off and went on through. 

I turn onto the street, and one ambulance block the street with their flashers shining off of every house in sight. I'm ordered by police to turn around and get to my delivery via another route (the neighborhood is laid out weird, and there are multiple ways to get to houses). Before I leave, I snap [this picture](http://imgur.com/hr9nF) and tweet about it, wondering if my friends know about what had happened. My old band drum major from high school I knew lived on that street and I thought about texting her to see what had happened, but I decided not to. 

A gut decision that I will never regret. 

I take my other deliveries, I get a call from a co-worker whose husband is the captain of patrol for my area's sheriff department. She explained that she had saw my tweet and wanted to clarify to me what had happened that night in the neighborhood. 

My drum major's father had taken the life of his wife that night

My stomach was churning and my chest tightened. I physically hurt after hearing what had happened. Never once did I think that in my delivery job would I witness such a horrible act. Never once. 

**TL;DR made a delivery on a street where a man had just murdered his wife.**

Edit 1: grammar.

Edit 2: I understand that this isn't the most fascinating story. The part that I believe to be intriguing was the fact that this event hit so close to home on many different levels.

Just a quick note: this happened in the early 2000s when I was about 18.  Names have been changed (either to protect the innocent or because I don't remember them). I'm going to apologize in advance for the length

Quick bit of backstory: Brian decided that he was going to hire another shift manager, so I was showing her the ropes on the in store work and he would show her the manager's side of things.  By the time I left, I was basically doing the 3/4 the work of a manager, had my own level 5 (manager) password, had a Papa John's jacket and windbreaker (gifts for managers at the time) and was the highest paid non-manager employee, so I can understand why he would hire someone else as a manager.  Holly and I got along pretty well and we became friends in the week or 2 I was training her.  What you should know about Holly is that she is one of those people who does whatever she wants without considering the consequences, enjoys shenanigans and is a bit of a firebug.

On my last day of work, I could do pretty much anything I wanted without worrying about being fired.  Among other things, I ended up climbing on top of the walkin and digging through all the stuff we had in storage.  Along with a ton of promotional stuff, I found a cache of phones, old terminals, broken printers and keyboards and the original server (it was something like a 386 CPU, 4MB memory

It's 9 or 10pm and it's the 2 of us and a driver on the clock and other employees would come and go randomly to say their goodbyes and hang out while getting stoned.  As I'm digging around through the storage area over the walkin, I didn't really know, but while she was gone, I may have tossed few hot bags, a dust-encrusted pizza peel and pizza cutter in my car because it was obvious they had never (and would never) be used in the store.  When she got back, she had 2 cans of starter fluid, a shopping cart

Without saying a word, we sat in the back, tossing things onto the fire and ""writing"" on parking spaces with starter fluid and lighting it.  When we had nothing but the server left, we popped the top and sprayed the inside with as much starter fluid inside as possible.  When it got tossed onto the flames, there was a few seconds of sizzling then ***FWOOSH!*** Flames must have shot 15 or 20ft into the air.  Looking back, I realize how lucky I was because we were sitting &lt;10ft from the cart and would have been severely burned if it had been aimed at us.

When all was said and done, which had to be crowbarred out of the road and various curse words and reproductive organs burnt into the surface of the road.  I'm not exaggerating, the wheels had melted and the legs (I'm not sure what else to call them) had melted about 1"" into the asphalt.  I had the 2 drivers and 2 other employees help me use a crowbar and hammer to break this thing free.  I tried to take pictures of it, but it was dark enough my shitty cell phone couldn't get any good pics of it (see part 3 for examples of my daylight pictures).  Remember, this phone was from the late 90s or very early 2000s and was one of those sign-up-for-a-2-year-contract-and-get-a-free-flip-phone phones.  I can tell you, the contents of the cart looked worse than [this](http://i.imgur.com/2HW4CWL.jpg).

We tossed everything into the dumpster and closed the shop for the night.  It blows my mind that the fire department wasn't called about the huge

I'm told there were questions from a few employees (Brian included) about what happened out back.  The story Holly came up with was that a few homeless guys must have started the fire and stayed the night before moving on.  Apparently no one questioned it

I sprinted back to my Jeep and floored it out of the neighborhood. Thankfully there were no cops and I didn't get trampled.

I was driving my first deliver of the day and it was to a very close house that was known for good tipping so a nice start. I was making a left turn into a side street and another car ran a red light and collided with the front of my car mid turn. He must have been going around 40 mph so my car got pretty messed up

 Nobody was hurt so we were thankful of that, and ensured me that him and his insurance would take care of everything) I called my family and gf really quick to assure them I was ok, and then I called my work back and told them what had happened.

 Now my boss is a well known dumbass and is not well liked within the store, unrelated but am I entitled to that tip? not a big deal but still something). I was then told to to bring my bank back into work when I had taken care of towing my car and dealing with the police. 

 When I do go back to work a few hours later I start talking to my boss and he starts giving me complete shit advice about seeing a sketchy doctor that could write in any injury I wanted

 This was not my first pizza job, but I did not have to do this at my current job because my boss is a lazy shit. I've been told that since I was on the clock during this, and on top of the stuff I just mentioned, they could be liable. I would rather not even attempt to draw the legal system into this, but our more recent interaction have caused me to reconsider.

 I went to the hospital later that night just to be safe and make sure I didn't have internal bleeding or a concussion

Here's acouple stories of my days as a pizza guy
#1
So I've got about an hour left on my shift and didn't feel like driving all over so I agree to take the motel order and then come back and fold boxes. I get to the motel and realize I'm delivering to the room on the corner of the first floor, hopping up and down on one leg while the other has blood pouring down it onto the carpet. As calmly as I could I tell the guy to close the door and get decent, he comes back with pants on this time, I get a $3 tip and a story.
#2
There was a gated community just down the street from us and for some reason they refused to give us a remote for the front gate, a few seconds later I'm greeted by this beautiful woman (early 20's brunette lowcut top) who takes the food and drinks and sets them on a table next to the front door, she comes back and starts making small talk/flirting (awe yeah, everyone loves the pizza guy) then grandma no bra with the see thru blouse comes to the door screaming how she never buzzed me in, tosses the money at me and slams the door. On the bright side she actually through enough money at me to where I still got tipped.
#3
I'd been delivering about 3 months at this point and hadn't experienced crazy customers yet. So it's my first delivery of the day and it's in a nice part of town, walk over and lean into the car and grab a dime and as soon as I turn around the guy is right in my face demanding his change, I hand him the dime and leave. When I got back to the store I told my manager who showed me how to leave comments about the customers so other drivers knew what to expect.
#4
So it's about 8 PM on a thursday night and I'd sent out to deliver to customer who'd complained about every order they'd received from us. They'd say that we'd given them the wrong order, since theirs was the only delivery I had I went straight back to the store. I see my manager is fuming, apparently everything was wrong and tastes horrible, so my manager remakes the exact order and sends me back but not before telling me that no matter what this customer is banned. So I put the pizzas into the heating bag and head back into the night. I made sure to park to where they couldn't see me coming, got out and grabbed the heating bag, made sure that it was secured tightly and started throwing it around, I did this for a solid minute and then I walked the order up to the house. They called and complained and for once they were right but they cried wolf too many times.

“So….not even a tuna salad sandwich?”


…..no. 

“Do you even have mustard and mayo for your subs?”

…….no.

“Ughh what the hell kinda place is this?!?”

….Its a…. It’s a pizza place. You know

“So what kind of subs can you make?”

([In my head] Were you not looking at the menu for five minute??) 
Well I can make subs that use pizza toppings. Like pizza subs. Sausage subs. Ect. 

“(smacks lips) Whatever. I don’t want anything.”

(She turns around and storms out)


**2.)** My company offers students k-12 a special incentive to work hard in school. If they receive straight “A’s” on their report card

So this lady calls the store and I answer. She sounded like one of those people who just fails at life. Like in every aspect. More so

Here’s how the conversation went.

Me: Hi

Her: Yeaa tell me bout dat strate a programm you all runnin

Me: Ok

Her: fine…so heres the deal. my kid got all a’s and then he got a B in gym class

Me: No ma’am

Her: Oh thats bullshit

Me: No. If the program was straight A’s and a “B” in gym

(At this point she was getting pissed off, if your kid isn’t getting an ""A"" in gym class, I would suggest the last thing you should be doing is getting your kid pizza. So the conversation goes on…)

Her: Ok…well fine then tell me da classes that have to be a’s to get the pizza

Me: All of them. Every single class.

Her: So what like englesh and maff and historie? 

Me: Every. Single. Class. Straight. A’s.

Her: Your srsly not goin too let that gym class slide?

Me: No.

Her: Ok…. well obviously you are stupid and dont know whatchu talking about. So why don’t you get me somewon who can properly answer my questions like your manager… 

Me: Ma’am, you can take them up with me directly.

Her: Oh well i bet you just luuuuvvvv talkin to me den. So fine if you aint gunna let my kid slide then maybe you can give my kindegardenar his free pizza dat he deserves.

Me: Possibly

Her: Well see dey dont go on the abc system. Its P and PP and smily faces n shit.

Me: Ok

Her: Well he got mostly p’s and a couple of pp’s. so yea i guess.

Me: So he got a few proficients

Her: Ok your are stupid you dont know what your doring. this is dum my kidz deserve a fre pizza and you are just being a dick abut it. 

*Click* 

She called one of our other stores complained about how rude I was and then tried the same thing at the other store. I mean

So about a week later this lady comes into my store with her two kids and they both have their report cards. She comes up to the register and I started helping her. She said, a “B” in gym and a few partially proficients on the other. 

At this point, my name is Joe, Im that dick manager, and no, I said I was **not** going to let it slide.”  She rolled her eyes. Eventually she just bought a pizza for her kids, which I watched her sit there and eat it herself and give none to her two kids.

**3.)** I had a lady call me up in tears

**4.)** This lady walks in and orders a personal size pizza

**5.)** I had a guy call up

After he finally decided on a pizza

He just stops and goes

""We don't have french fries sir...""

""BULLSHIT!! You used to.""

""No


**Just a side note**
I know what its like to work first hand in customer service. I know how it feels to have to deal with an asshole customer. And because of it I’m probably one of the most last back people when it comes to issues. If my food is wrong, but at least you have a meal to eat.

Just remember

While my wife was watching duck dynasty last night, when I was 17 or 18

Rob picked up a new set of knives that he saw advertised on TV (think miracle blade infomercial)

I grabbed an assortment of watermelons, and a few other things I can't remember off hand.  As I was leaving the produce section, something caught my eye. There was a sale on coconuts.  Yes, I must get some.

I head back to the store

What was to come could only be described as real life multiplayer fruit ninja.  2 drivers would toss fruit and 2 of us were ninjas.  These things cut through everything we threw at it like they weren't even there.  We even took onions and promotional basketballs from the store to use.  The basketballs would usually bounce off the blade, but I was cutting clean through them every time.  At one point, I cut the onion twice in mid air, earning me $10 from one of the drivers who bet it couldn't be done. I was having the time of my life. 

It didn't take long for us to cover the floor in bits of fruit and a surprising amount of juice.  Once we had exhausted our supply of soft-ish produce, but he bounced the blade off the shell and bent the blade at about a 45^o angle.

Brian, of course).  He took the knife into the office and after several minutes of banging, declared it dead.  He gave it back in 2 pieces--snapped the blade off at the hilt.  Rob does the only thing a rational person would do to the thing that broke his brand new knife--he used the coconut as a baseball and the hammer as the bat.

When he hit the coconut

**TL;DR We were playing fruit ninja before it was cool and before [duck dynasty](http://www.aetv.com/duck-dynasty/video/duck-digest-samurai-si-8056387987?pfilter=ALL%20VIDEOS#8056387987) stole our idea and put it on tv.**

My tale of how I thwarted a robbery and got a $15 tip at the same time goes as such.

It was a half hour from closing time when we get an order to a really nasty part of town through our online ordering system.

“Great… Hey Bubba looks like we got one more to 123 Fake Steet.” I call out to my manager.

“Okay

I’m completely fine with this because with cooking time I’m looking at getting back to the store 45 minutes after we close. I cut and box the pizzas and clock out the delivery.

I look at the driver’s notes and see “Deliver to back door.” 

“Welp

I get to the house and go to the back and it’s just pitch black outside. So instead of keeping my gun in my holster

The guy finally answers the door after what seemed an eternity of waiting. I tell him what his total is and he says

“What are you talking about?”

“You retarded whiteboy? I’ll shoot you.”

“Not before I will

He stammers a little and just hands me a $50 bill and I hand him the food with my free hand. The next thing I know the door’s being slammed in my face. 

I get in my car and peel the fuck out spraying rocks everywhere just to get out of there as soon as possible. As soon as I get to a main road that’s well lit I call Bubba and tell him what happened and ask what I should do. He told me to just get back to the store as soon as I can and to leave the police out of it because nobody was hurt.

It took me almost 30 minutes to get back because I was shaking so badly I kept stalling my car at stops and grinding gears left and right because I couldn’t seem to work my clutch pedal correctly. That’s the story of my scariest experience delivering pizzas. The best thing is after this happened his address was entered into the *very* small “do not deliver” list we have that only exists for customers who use or threaten violence.

Just a quick note: this happened in the early 2000s when I was 17 or 18

After the fight club dissolved, including a fairly large hardware store right where the shopping center label is on the map.  According to Google maps' measure tool, it was just over a quarter mile (almost 450m) from the end of the hardware store to the end of the super market's loading docks and between 40 and 50 feet (12 and 15m) wide.  You can get an idea of how it looks in some of the pics in part 3.

-----------------

Anyway

It didn't take long for Brian to figure out how to make some $$ off this new hobby.   He took some $$ from the till and got 2 stopwatches so we could keep times and (try to) settle disputes.  He started to take bets on races and pulled in a fair amount of money

The best race I could remember was between Rob and another in store employee, and for good reason, but Dave was not scared of a challenge.  Rob was the only son of pretty wealthy parents and drove around in a Porsche (I think it was a 968, but I can only remember certain details about it), while Dave was a middle class 17 year old who drove his parents' new minivan.  Everyone but one person bet on Rob to win, because seriously, it was a minivan vs a porsche. 

They took their places at the far end of the parking area and waited for the flag.  We all held our breath as they peeled out and started racing down the ""track"".  Rob pulled ahead slightly at the beginning, we were even more amazed at the winner of the bet--our driver with the gambling problem--Dan.  Dan was pretty stoked about winning because now he could finally finish paying off his bookie.  There were accusations of collusion, but Rob was adamant he didn't throw the race.  He blamed it on the shop that had just worked on his car for screwing something up.  After taking it back and having them look it over again, he challenged Dave to a rematch.  This time, Rob won by a pretty significant distance.

Street racing went on for most of the summer without any serious injuries or damage.  There were 2 or 3 times when a dumpster got kissed by a bumper or car door and a couple very close calls where cars almost got sideswiped or T-boned.  The drivers may have been stoned

To this day, though. Whatever their reasons, I'm glad they didn't because it was a lot of fun to watch and gave us a much-needed break from work.

**tl;dr We raced busted ass cars in the parking area behind the store.  In one race

&gt;So I was delivering pizzas for Domino's, so I honk and flash my brights, but sure enough, she doesn't see me and slams her mirror into mine.  

&gt;I'm on the phone, and called 911. I delivered my pizza, and then as I'm driving down University, I see her in front of me! So I follow her, call 911 again, then she turns the wrong way on University!  [It's a one way]

&gt;After I send squad cars in her direction, ""definately getting a DUI."" No real damage, cept my mirror. I'm debating if I should bring the insurance company in or not. Calling daddy tomorrow, but fun night reguardless!  

That was posted the night of the accident.  I found out she didn't have insurance and if I wanted her to pay for any of the damage I'd have to take her to small claims court.  So I got an estimate on the mirror and there was a side swipe I didn't really see cause it was dark and it came out to be 1500 dollars. I paid the 50 bucks or whatever it was to file a claim with the court.  

People's Court, but the woman told them on the phone that she was guilty and intended to plead so.  So, no show.  

Anyway, he says we can talk about that in the hall, she offers 50 bucks a week, I say that's fine, and we go back in and tell the judge.  He rules that's what will happen and we go our separate ways.

On my way over to the hotel I read the ticket wrong and mistakenly went to the incorrect one. I still had plenty of time before the order would be late, and they inform me there are no guest reservations with that particular last name. In the town I deliver in, there's probably 25 hotels and a few with very similar names. The hotel on the ticket was the ""Days Inn Bridgeview Lodge"" so I drove back across town near where I dropped off order #1 to the ""Days Inn Lakefront"". On my way there I call the store and explain the situation to my manager. Once arriving at room 210 there, housekeeping is in the process of cleaning that room. With no other options, i'm forced to drive back to the shop and await for the customer to call. 

When I get back to the store, over an hour has passed so I just begin doing some dishes. Eventually they call back and ask where their order is. We get the correct room number and last name and remake their food for them. They were actually at room 201 at the Bridgeview Lodge, not 210. When I get their pizza to them I offer to give them the old pizza and an order of bread sticks we threw in for free. They accepted both, and I still earned a $4 tip.

So I get to the dorm and call the guy from my car because I assume he's not downstairs. Well he is downstairs and I say great I'll be in there shortly. I walk in and see he's paying by clipper card but it's odd looking and I didnt see a clippercard slip on the reciept. 

So I say alright you need to call the store, and I know its the owner this time. he asks what's the number on it, he says the number under the barcode( which idk the purpose of but isnt the right number it should be S000000) alright he's told that's not the right number it should be the s000000 number. Well surprise he doesn't have a s000000 on his clippercard. So he hands over the phone to me because the owner wants me to explain wtf is going on to him, so I tell him it's a guest clippercard. He says well do they have any other way to pay? I ask and his friend says he has a cc up stairs but doesn't want to use it. 

So we hang up and I try to come up with solutions because I care about the customers and don't want to deny them food, I could've left and done my other deliveries my boss would've understood just sayin'. I'm trying to help you guys out. Then I overhear the kid saying it's been over an hour and 1/2 since they ordered for the pizza to arrive.

Most of them just tell me cool stories or I compliment them on their cool clothes because they always have cool clothes. One time I had to go a really far way for a delivery but it was worth it because I spent like 5 minutes talking to this little boy about Lady and the Tramp and he showed me a magic trick. 

Some of my favorite pizza delivery stories involving kids: 

* This was one of my first ever deliveries. A kid peeks out the window after I knock and yells ""THE PIZZA GUY IS HERE! IT'S A GIRL!"" and then another kid replied ""bout time we got a girl from Pizza Hut"" 
* I was delivering to a house and there were 3 or 4 kids looking out the upstairs window of the house across the street. They all started cheering for me and asking me to bring them some pizza. I smiled at them and waved and then gave the person their pizza. As I was leaving they all yelled for me again ""BRING US SOME PIZZA!"" and I said ""Sorry I don't have anymore :("" ""It's okay!!!"" They were so cute haha. 
* My absolute favorite: One time my manager told me he thought this lady was lying about having a coupon so he asked me to make sure I got it from her. She opened the door and I asked her if she had her coupon and she said she'd have to go inside to get it, yelled ""PIZZA LADY SEXY!"" and then ran away.

First thing first:

1.DON'T TALK about a tip, don't let it ruin your day and maybe you'll get tipped big on the next one. 

2. Odd and even numbered buildings and houses are on opposite sides of each other. This is the case 99% of the time. Sometimes some developer will do something ridiculous like build an even numbered building on the odd side. Bring a flashlight for night shifts

3. In cities, pay it or contest it, don't forget about it! 

4. Always look for a call box for apartment complexes or lofts. You can search up the customer's and they can buzz you in. I try to avoid sneaking in to complexes and often call up just in case they are paranoid about unwanted visitors. 

5. Turn your AC off if possible and leave your car on for quick drop offs. This will really help you on gas expenses. 

6. If you need a credit card slip filled out, ""fill it out"". For cash orders that need change, ask ""How much change do you need back?"", not ""Do you need change?"", because they'll laugh at you and be a little offended. 

7. Make small talk with customers

8. DRIVE SAFELY! After driving for two years

9. Have your phone charged and working at all times. Don't be afraid to call a customer to get info. Watch out for your minutes if you aren't using a company phone. I went over big time just calling customers for 5 second calls. It adds up. 

10. It doesn't hurt to check with the kitchen and staff to make sure your order is perfect. We are essentially motorized waiters

After signing up for our service

If the driver waits too long or drives too far away

Eventually

*Benefits of this Service*

- the customer who ordered gets a seamless experience: as far as he knows

- Lin Cho's is able to increase their revenue by increasing by a small fixed and variable cost

- the drivers who deliver for WLD will be able to keep busy and hopefully complete more orders than they normally would

_____________________________________________________
The GM hired a new girl to be an insider. I could already tell there was something off about her. Imagine: inappropriate
Before she completed her first week in the store, and they are already leafing through brochures for their *honeymoon*. 
She hasn't even begun her third week of working for him.

:

**Little Description of These Two**

My GM is loony. Imagine a gangling 6'4"" dude with head-to-toe kindergarten-doodle tattoos

This chick who he hired is this twiggy sapling

:

**Moving On...**

No one really gave her too much mind in the beginning. She was just really, and I'm an annoying mental case whose voice is so annoying that people can't do their work. She also mentioned, with a smirk on her face, that I wasn't going to last long in the store.

Bitch

:

I informed the shift manager. He promptly wrote her up. A few days later, and we did hang out a lot, but then he got creepy and I told him I was more comfortable with a manager-employee relationship, blahblahblah.)
Everyone caught wind of what happened

***That was just within the first week.*** Lately, the key to the cash drawer, the office keys... WTF. 

She has lost the store tons of money due to making shit-food


I told myself I would give this situation a little over one month to sort itself out. I have &lt;2 weeks to go. If it doesn't settle down in there
This girl and the GM are going to bring themselves to their own demise with their desperate behavior. I can't wait to wave goodbye to them both.

:

**TL**;**DR**: Boss bones girl employee. Girl goes Hitler on pizza store. Soon it will be time for justice.

__________

**Update 1:** I decided to visit the store today on my day off. I gave everyone a pat on the back and asked them to relay what's been going on in the store:

""She *still* has the store keys...""

""She is messing up all these orders...""

""I'm gonna punch this girl...""

Even B.

Then I heard that girl squawk

Everyone sort of stood there

""Oh my God! she's not listening to me

I had to be escorted out of the store by the shift manager. All of the customers' faces read

I sat in my car and waited until one of my good buddies left the store to make a delivery. I got in his car and he told me about the unbearable drama that's been going on in the store.

""She's a bitch, he's already been fired. GM's lady was nagging about him all day and telling GM to fire the new kid, and he finally did it. He sent him home.""

I was going to wait until the next week was up before I called someone higher-up to discuss the situation
___
**Update 2:** Ugh, and saying how he'll fix everything. Ummm, no. I'm still going to the DM about this. I don't want an avalanche of drama freezing up the store.

The funniest part of the conversation was when he said, I got it all figured out now. I can read women pretty well. I sorta think she was trying to manipulate me.""  DERP?

______
**Update 3:** I finally talked to the DM last night. He said he'll definitely look into it and talk to other employees. I'm eager to see what happens. 

______
**Update 4:** Nothing much has happened. The DM simply gave my GM a slap on the wrist

Basically what happened when they met up: The GM came into DM's store to actually complain about *another employee, GM, I want to talk about something else with you. I'm getting complaints from a few employees in your store about your girlfriend. From what I hear, it is getting in the way of the store.""

My GM had the dumbest response: ""What?! That's stupid. If anything

Yeah

The store is a lot more quiet now

Still
_________________
**Update 5:** Since the DM wasn't pulling his own weight

Half and hour later, and therefore she would at least be transferred. She was gone by the time I got back to the store. 

That was a week or two ago. I found out that she was fired from the other store shortly after the transfer. ***HA***.

She still has an iron grip on my boss. It's clear to everyone that she's been influencing him to buy pills and heroin. He's also been messing up way too many orders as a GM. I'm always the one dealing with the angry customers. He leaves two 16-year-old noob employees at the make-line in order to talk to his girl on the phone 24/7. I hate working with this guy

But I guess I don't have to worry about being around him so much

**Story #9: The origin story of ""The Blacklist""**

Most of y'all have enjoyed my deliver stories and it's been mentioned a few times in comments that the store I worked in had a running ""blacklist"" of houses that we either did not deliver to or were shifted to the bottom of the priority list.

About three months into my first stint as a driver for a national pizza chain I started to notice a pattern of regular customers who did not tip.  We're not talking tiny tips

Anyway I was one of two full-time drivers (*we split shifts on all seven days

Around this time we were ""upgrading"" &lt;insert rolling eyes&gt; to a new order management and dispatch system.  While setting things up we noticed we could customize the order taking screen.  There was one line item for delivery notes that was ""public"" (*in other words it would show up on the printed receipt*) and another that was ""private"" (*you could see it in the GUI but that line would not print out on an order receipt*).  Realizing this we both exchanged knowing looks and began referring to ""Delivery Note #2"" as the ""Blacklist Line.""

Once the new system went live we started keeping track of things like which customers were great tippers and super nice (*high priority customers*) and which customers were assholes

After about three months we had a pretty smooth system going.  If a blacklisted customer ordered I would refuse to take it and leave it for one of the drivers with less seniority. If they got a good tip they would make a note on line two.  

I guess I should explain that it wasn't like once a customer was blacklisted that was it.  It wasn’t a once-and-done thing. We kept updating the entries (*both good and bad*) on a regular basis.

Anyway there was one particular customer I and the rest of the drivers had finally gotten to the point of refusing to deliver to them **period** under any circumstances.  I deleted their address from the system and made a note in that said they were habitually rude, and often complained for no reason what-so-ever just so they could get free pizza (*like saying the cheese was stuck to the top of the box when I checked before getting out of the car, or the pizza was late and cold; stupid petty things that were pretty much bull-shit attempts at free pizza*).  The manger was already tired of this customer's shit but still had to abide by the whole ""*customer is always right*"" shit.

So one night asshole customer calls in and the poor girl taking orders didn't know what hit her. She says that we (*as a store*) are unable to deliver to them.  (*It wasn't uncommon for people outside our delivery zone to try and call in an order on a busy night.  So we noted those customers in the system too*).  Well asshole customer goes off on her.  She starts crying and hands the phone to the manager.  He gets the customer's story and then tells the customer he will call them right back.

I come in from an order and get cornered by the manager.  I could tell he was pissed but he gave me a chance to explain the situation.  A few minutes later the other full-timer comes in and confirms the story as well as why we made the decision to not deliver to asshole customer any more.

Manager calls asshole customer and flat-out tells him out it is. A heated pseudo-argument ensues and the managers ends by saying

From then on ""The Blacklist"" became an accepted thing and during an all-store staff meeting the following week the system was explained so that everyone else who worked there (*who were all expected to take orders over the phone*) understood what ""Delivery Line #2"" meant.

A few months later I ended up leaving the store (*on good terms*) and went to school out of town.  After finishing school and moving back home I decided to pick up delivering again part-time while I continued on in grad-school (*this time in town*).  A total of four years had passed between my first stint as a driver (*back in 1999*) to my second stink (*in 2003*).  On my first day back as a driver I noticed ""The Blacklist"" was still going strong.  Needless to say I was pleased.

**TL;DR:** A fellow driver and I at a national pizza chain instituted a “black list” of customers that were habitual problems and/or the “exact-change/no-tip” type.  Manager found out about the list after dealing with the king of all assholes on our blacklist and not only endorsed the list but also had us explain the list to the rest of the store.",,t5_2uh13,1360871325.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/18j58q/the_origin_story_of_the_blacklist_story_9/

By this I mean that when a black person answers the door I assume that I'm not getting a tip and 90% of the time I am correct

When a white person answers the door


I'm not being racist. This is a fact. I want to know if this is a race thing

PS, the guy/gal is driving his own motherfucking car to your house so you don't have to get off your ass for more than two minutes to pay for it. I know that no black person wants their delivery people to leave screaming at their steering wheel ""Goddamn it!!! Can I deliver to one person today who isn't a fucking n**ger?!""

**edit**: I performed a tally poll today in honor of the Olympics. Whites won the games with 8-1 tip to non-tips. They also accounted for 80% of my total tip value and 90% of my tips above $3. Hispanics came in second place with the best tip ratio (4 out of 4, but from today my numerical values put black people at both the lowest tip to non-tip ration and the lowest amount per tip. 

If I'd raised the bar to $3 or $4 to qualify as a point

**edit 2**: Day two of the Olymtips. Few white people served today, that's 2 tips out of 10 deliveries), falling below the 30% tip ratio, but also wasting my time arguing with my manager about free food for 20 minutes while I was standing there holding pizzas. I considered removing a point for douchebaggery, but then I remembered what my name is. Hispanics broke their perfect record today falling at 7-1, but are still giving an outstanding performance. 


So far, while hispanics totaled 10 and whites 14. I'll admit that I've underestimated hispanics. They're performing well above expectation.

I was running late now but i had called several times and got no answer. It was a church so i supposed that no body was actually in the office and they were waiting for me in the after service room. Well

She takes me into the kitchen and as i unload the pizza
She really ddn't like that. I'm pretty sure she didn't say anything else. She handed me the original check for full price and stormed off. So

1342559929.0,wq18u,Some of most memorable experiences,trennerdios,51,5,19,"I was a delivery driver for nearly 3 years


* THE WORST: Delivered to a very fat man wearing nothing but an open robe. I didn't see his junk because his stomach was covering it, and his apartment reeked. He didn't say a word to me, just paid me and took his food. I told my manager when I came back that I would never deliver there again. Relatively, though, I admit that this is far from the worst thing that one can experience as a delivery driver. Whenever I remember this story I always think of the Jimmy John's delivery driver who was murdered in Milwaukee while he was working a few years back.


* Flashed by a large drunk girl twice in the same delivery. She hopped out from behind a wall the first time (as a different girl was paying me)


* One time, and I kid you not, there was so much of it that it covered the ground completely, and it looked like snow. I had to wait in my vehicle right outside the house until it subsided, and I could see the people inside watching me. When it finally stopped (as suddenly as it started) I was able to deliver their food. They didn't tip me.


* Another time there was an actual tornado warning. The tornado had actually touched down just west of the town. A guy called up and asked if we were still delivering with the tornado going on. I told him sure


* I live in a college town in WI that has what they call ""Beer Gardens"" every year after graduation. It's the busiest day of the year for us, so it gets pretty crazy. I was never so happy to see cops everywhere in my life. I came out to my car once to find a bald douche bag about to start pissing on my car. I told him in less than polite words that it was my car and to not even start. He walked over to the next car and started peeing on it instead. I had to walk about 15 feet to find the nearest cop and direct him to the idiot pissing on cars.


* The majority of black people in our town are unsettlingly stereotypey. Usually, though, I can't even hold it against them considering how much I made in tips on average. But there was the one guy who gave me money, then started turning around to go upstairs before I could even offer him change. I started to leave, but he turned around said ""Hey man, the total was $XX.XX! You owe me at least a quarter!"" I gave him back a little more than what I owed him, since I never carried exact change. Really??


* ""What are your specials?"" became the most hated phrase ever. A lot of that was because of hearing it so often, but was wondering if you had any specials for something like that?"" It was always, ""Uh, yeah, like what are your specials?"" Cue me reading off all 10 of our specials, 9 of which didn't apply to anything they wanted, and then 85% of the time they'd end up ordering a single pepperoni pizza. Fuck you if you do this.

Just a quick note: this happened in the early 2000s when I was 16 or 17

There was about 2 weeks one spring when we had an assistant manager (who shall be called Josh) who was really into fight club.  He thought it would be a good idea to start one in the back of the store.  I should also mention this: Josh was an asshole and an alcoholic.  Not your everyday asshole

The drivers--who if you haven't read parts 1 and 2 were usually high on weed, the fight stops'.  One slow summer night a few days later, it started.  2 of the drivers were given gloves and they duked it out behind the store in the parking lot. Once they had boxed themselves out, 2 more drivers took up the fight.  It went like this pretty much every night for a week when we had some down time.  It began to get a little out of hand after that, though.

During one of the fights, would have turned a friendly fight into a brutal beating had the other drivers not stepped in.  Whether or not it was accidental, I can't say, but the driver swore it wasn't intentional.  Either way, the gloves came off and it became a brawl.  They were wrestling on the floor, throwing punches and trying to pin their opponent.  

It was a few minutes before the drivers could get in and break it up.  Josh walked out and was gone the rest of the night.  Brian sent the driver home to nurse his fat lip and bloody nose.  This was the end of out fight club.  When Josh came back the next day

I apologize for the poor quality

I would always run in and out of the store and to the door.  This was just good work ethic but also made me sweat and people noticed and seemed to tip me more.  When it was raining I would make sure to get soaking wet before I went to the door and I'd try the sympathy card.  

Also I had a pen and bumper sticker that went a little like [this](http://images4.cpcache.com/product/289085694v6_350x350_Front_Color-White.jpg).  This didn't help much but I still have the bumper sticker on my car and hope that some people read it and start to tip drivers (I don't deliver anymore).

Probably one of the more messed up things I did...though I don't regret it but some would frown upon it.  I worked at PJI and was one of their 3 good drivers (everyone else pretty much sucked).  Well us 3 had the managers code so we could check out more than 2 deliveries at a time and we could view every ones runs and at what time they checked him out at.  Well when the 3 or just 2 of us where working together, S, etc.).  With the managers code we could check to see what all the other drivers where checking out and when.  We all knew how fast the other drivers where and could very accurately gauge all their times for when they would be back from the delivery they just took.  So we had a system going to where when we checked if one of us where lined up for something good we just wouldn't say anything.  But if I knew one of the other 2 would be back before someone else and the next run was a South run (99% stiffs) I'd send them a text it would go something like ""**5**(amount of time they need to waste before getting back to the store)**SE**(Where that run was going)""  With this system we would keep ourselves out of the bad areas.  We also would use this system to fuck over drivers who took bullshit runs.  What we did might have been bull shit but we never took bullshit runs.  Also the other drivers where just terrible and would take 15 minutes or so more time than they really should have been taking also they would clock out retarded runs and leave things they should have taken.

So, and start heading north, and there, in the middle of the *frontage* road was a van that had obviously rolled several times. Its tires were missing or really bent at an angle they shouldn't have been bent at. There is no front grill guard. Half of the roof is caved in. Also, the horn. I think the car alarm was set off, because every 3 seconds we'd get to really loud beeps. 

A drunk driver had rear-ended this van on the freeway

The van was an airport shuttle that was carrying an elderly couple.

So, grab my flashlight, and I immediately see the elderly couple in the front row of the van. The lady is holding a towel to her head, but appears to generally be fine. Maybe a concussion. The guy's right side (closest to the doors of the van) was covered in blood. He was missing his arm. It was severed right below his shoulder. There were tendons, bone, and muscle just hanging out. He was fading in and out of consciousness. The driver of the van had given another person a belt, and they devised a tourniquet to stop the bleeding. I wish I could have helped more

When they finished with the old man, there's still traffic, and people can't see that well at night. I wrangled him back to the sidewalk of the frontage road, and we waited for the police there. We talked about what had happened, and he ultimately seemed more calm when the police arrived and started interviewing us. 

An ambulance pulled up, and although she could stand up, they put her in a stretcher and hauled her off too. 

The thing I remember most was what this lady said. She was another first responder (citizen, I have you arm.""

There are a few specific customers who I (and my fellow insiders) work with to facilitate any possible disabilities they might have. 

There's this one really sweet older gentleman who has pretty severe Parkinson's, right? Anyway, with any new drivers who bring him his food we always have to emphasize the absolute necessity that they MAKE SURE he has a firm hold on the food before they let go.

There's another guy who lives in a community for adults with special needs. Really sweet guy. I love answering the phone when he calls. This man is apparently the nerdiest looking white guy ever. I've only ever heard his voice on the phone

This one other guy who only ever comes in to order and pick up his food always takes the time to chat to us ladies while qr make his food. He's apparently really allergic to black olives, so we do 3/4 normal toppings and leave the other 1/4 (two slices) just plain cheese.

* Had a co-worker who was only with us for a few weeks, incapable of doing much of anything right. He was yelled at for turning the pizza bag sideways while carrying it (with pizza in it, of course), which ruined the pizza. That's not a huge deal, but he went on to do it about 3 more times. I still remember one of the shift runners who is still a friend of mine saying in such a sad, disappointed way, ""It wasn't really his fault


* A guy who I knew when I was younger ordered from us for awhile when we used to run these boneheaded specials. Basically the special would be something like ""Large Gourment Pizza or Build Your Own Pizza (unlimited toppings) + cheese sticks for $23"" or whatever. 
Well this dickbag would use that to order a large pizza with triple black olives, double cheese, double onions, half alfredo sauce half salsa, etc. Bascially a $50 pizza for less than half the price. On a few occasions he would send it back because ""the cheese slid"". YOU DON'T SAY? The 10 lbs of toppings on your disgusting piece of shit pizza managed to shift due to the slightest tilt? What a surprise. And they actually replaced it for him on more than one occasion. *Sigh.*
He apparently also complained that his pizza wasn't cooked all the way through on one or more occasions until the manager explained it wasn't possible to cook it properly due to all the shit piled on top of it. They eventually got rid of the stupid specials he was taking advantage of. He was the ONLY person who abused it. 
On the one occasion that I had to deliver it to him

**Me:**  That will be $23.50

**Him:**  Here you go. Just let me check the pizza quick.

**Him:**  Oh hey the cheese is sliding off of it.

**Me:**  Okay. *Shrugs*

*I turn and walk away back to my car.*


* I delivered to a guy who literally looked exactly like James Brown from his infamous mug shot photo. He asked me if I was the guy he had ""sold some shit to awhile back"". I told him no


* I once had to clean the entire pizza oven and the area around it with the help of one other person. It was an annual thing, none of us non-managers knew about it beforehand.

Later when that driver is jockeying to get sent home. I mention in front of the closing manager ""Don't forget to take out the day trash before you leave"" and nothing much is said, I'll just leave it at that. On a side note though, I was supposed to have dishes, but since I was expecting heavy rain all thru the rush and to be busy and late getting off by 8, I opted to pay an insider $7 bucks (which he wanted paid in Girl Scout cookies that I have instead of the cash I offered. (Weird details, but that is how it happened and you'll see why that detail is important in a minute...)

Anyways, but the trash remains, and it's now overflowing. I'm disappointed, but hey, I did my part, right? No effect on me, right?

So I take my last runs and get done just after 8. Just as I am grabbing my cash to check out the managers says to me ""Since you don't have dishes anymore
""I PAID to get out of doing dishes

So after I get done bitching about how this happens time and time again and how I will take even more overt action to change things (I won't reveal that at the moment) I agree to take out the trash in the rain for the good of the shop and so as not to push the burden off on yet another person later who is at no fault...

So

What do you think about a driver who does this over and over again

What ways do you suggest that I retaliate (with the blessings of management of course!)?

1375426984.0,1jjv3v,My experience driving for a pizza place that delivers almost exclusively to the ghetto,amb0385,36,7,6,"Selling Pizza to Crack Heads: My Time as a Driver

After working at this place off-and-on for only about 6 months in total over the course of a few years

Anyway, even after 1:00 am, which is illegal in where I live. Also, it was always rumored to be a drug front. There would be at least 3 people loitering in the parking lot (which is more like a driveway) and they all looked like ex-cons. When I started working there, I discovered that they were the employees. And that they were in fact crazy ex-cons.

I started working there in summer of 2010 because I needed a job immediately and it seemed like a place that would hire anyone. The first driver I met was named Lonny. He looked really rough, “fuckin’ coon BITCH! Fuckin’ nigger BITCH!” Again, I’m not kidding about any of this. The manager was about 4 feet away, and didn’t even act like she noticed. He put his hand up to his mouth when he did in an attempt to disguise the fact that it was him yelling it, which was pretty funny because there was no one else around. Years later, I was talking with my dad’s friend who happens to be a private investigator about where I worked and he flipped out. He was shocked that I worked there because he had a client who worked there and was robbed by three black dudes in ski masks who ordered a pizza to a vacant house. They pulled him inside and beat him almost to death with crowbars and baseball bats. It turned out it was Lonny.

There was another lifer that worked there named Craig and he could get away with whatever he wanted because he was the fastest driver by far. He would get twice the runs as anyone else. He was definitely a lifer. He had been through a lot at that place. When he wasn’t at work

The owner would come in every night after midnight and take over. Let’s call him… Shteve. He was a normal-looking old guy, and general lack of professionalism at his business and he didn’t care. I think that he actually preferred it that way because he could treat his white trash employees like shit, which he very evidently enjoyed. The misfits that he hired weren’t the kind of people to quit and get a job at Starbuck’s. I’m talking about a certain class of employee that is a couple notches below Waffle House server. They really needed that job. The kitchen staff was mostly fat lesbians. The owner would always give them the most shit. Really intense sexual harassment, it was pretty despicable; although I did laugh when he suggested to an especially butch one that she should “fulfill her life’s destiny and get a job at Stanley Steamer with all the other lesbians.

It was pretty clear that Steve purposefully cultivated his base of ghetto customers. That was his niche; if it weren’t for the fact that other places didn’t deliver to shitty neighborhoods, Andy. Now you’re going to a crack house” as he handed me my next delivery. He wasn’t kidding about it being a crack house. One of the other drivers told me that she delivered to a crack house one time and the guy attempted to pay her in crack. Steve was a total asshole to people on the phone, too. One time he took a delivery order, was frustrated because the guy on the other end was hard to understand, and went totally nuts. He said, “if you fucking crack heads on Pontiac Ave. call back here again, I’m gonna bust your head open with a ball bat.” Then he hung up and said to me, here’s your next one. It’s going up to Pontiac Ave.” 

Years later, did you? Didn’t you hear about when ” It turns out that an acquaintance of ours who is like 40 stopped by there on time back in the 90’s to get a pizza and ended up leaving with his pants full of shit. He went in, and the guy at the counter (from the description it sounds like Steve, although I’m not sure) was doing card tricks, trying to swindle customers out of money. “I bet you twenty bucks I can pick your card out,” he said. Our friend, thinking that he was kidding about the bet, our friend laughed and acted impressed to be polite. He was just there for his pizza, but he just stood there. “Eh

The pizza is a solid 2/5.

So I get on the phone and start with the apologizing and ass-kissing. Of course this lady was understandably completely pissed off, the order goes through, everything is hunky-dory, and I go on with my night.

He gives his phone to me to talk to his wife to help figure this out. Guess who? Yep, it was Mrs. 10min Hold. After she started yelling at me and I realized who it was, I got him the right order and sent him on his way.

Later on, I realize that during the rush I probably screwed up while using the till. I'm not very good with the till. A little more digging and we found that while I was $30 short, another driver was $25 over and the till was $85 over. I'm still not entirely sure what happened there, but in the end I was even.

yes, completely naked, playing commando in the front lawns of the neighborhood.   

so as I'm driving I realize I have passed up the house, which happens to be the place where the first kid balled up on the grass trying to hide from me.  or hide from whatever. 

I get out of the car (4 pizzas to deliver) and make my way to the front door. ring, knock.. no one has answered.  walk around to the door under the open garage, ring the doorbell, knock again... no answer (there is a clothed teen playing on the computer as I can see him through the open window in the door so he is clearly ignoring me. 

so I hear some noise to my right, and goes inside the house.  He comes out about 5 minutes later with a pair of shorts on, hands me the money, takes the pizza, and I jet. 

As I'm driving out of the neighborhood street, sitting in the middle of the road staring at my car as I drive past.  I hold out my hand and give him a high five as i drive off to delivery number 2.  

To this day I cant explain why I high-fived a naked teen boy at midnight thirty while driving in my car.

One of their store policies was ""delivered in 30 minutes or it's on us.""  One of the trailer parks on the outskirts of town would order several pizzas on the weekends and my brother was usually the guy who went out to deliver them.  On several occasions he would arrive well within the 30 minute time limit to deliver the pies.  He would ring the doorbell and knock on the door

A few minutes after he would leave the trailer park he'd get a call from his manager saying that the people in the trailer park called to complain that their pizza hadn't been delivered yet and that they should get it for free when it finally did arrive.  My bro would then have to drive back to their trailer and give them their pizzas.  Of course they'd neglect to tip him as well as ""he was late"" and therefore it was 100% free.

This went on for several weeks

When the manager started to notice that the same thing was happening to the other delivery driver on the weekends at the same trailer park he started to get suspicious.  One night he went out to deliver the pizzas himself and finally saw what was really going on.  For months this trailer park had been getting free pizzas.

I didn't run into anyone insanely evil that I recall, and the way I tip them, ever since. In the upper-class neighborhoods, I literally got nothing every single time but in the more rundown streets, I received reasonable tips and never felt like I had been stiffed. 

One afternoon I ended up at the most rundown apartment building I had ever seen. There was a chain-link fence around the yard which was full of dead, older, maybe nine-years-old, with her. I heard him utter at least one f-word as I passed them. I went up the outside staircase onto the balcony in front of the upper apartments. The one I was going to was the last unit. To reach the door, I had to walk over a couple of large boards that had been laid across the walkway. I don't know if there were holes in the balcony and I'm glad I didn't look. I knocked on their door, gave them their pizza and they handed me five dollars. I almost felt like I shouldn't keep it but it probably would have insulted them to try to give it back. I remembered it every time I walked up to one of those mini-mansions on the hill, with their landscaped yards and two hundred dollar porch light fixtures and I hoped that if I ever became rich that I would never forget to tip everyone who did anything for me

I don't work now and I don't need to. I'm not insanely wealthy but I have lost sticker shock over most common items and forgotten to some degree just how much even a few dollars means to many people. I tip as well as I can and always kind of feel like it's not enough because I don't know what they normally get. That was until a much poorer friend recently remarked, thank God.

When the man answered the phone, he and his wife had come in and weren't pleased with the flavor of the ranch dressing. They informed their server, the server replaced the salad but they felt like the server should have taken the salad off the bill as well. Not our usual policy, but whatever, I wasn't going to argue over $6.00. This particular store was a problem store on a lot of different fronts, including false customer complaints. People would try to get free food by complaining about a previous order, even though no previous order existed. So, and he understands and agrees. He doesn't have his receipt

""Between
""That doesn't help much
""No.""
""Do you remember if it was a boy or girl?""
""No.""

""The problem is that he's my assistant manager and also my friend
""You're not giving me my money back?""

It starts to snow just as I arrive to work around dusk. It hardly ever snows in the area and when it does it's usually just a dusting. Not this time. I take my first delivery out and it's a tripple. A minute or so after leaving it REALLY starts to snow. I'm driving a VW Golf

About ten minutes on the way to the first house I lose control and slide off the road. Keep in mind I'm only doing about 10 MPH. I'm very slowly sliding towards one of those ""can on a stick"" style mailboxes. I'm going soo slow and with no control whatsoever so I can see what's going to happen. I hit the post just hard enough to push it over and come to a stop a couple feet past it. By this point I am laughing hysterically. I get my shit together and get out of the car to look at the damage. I find the house number on the box and walk up to the door of the house to talk to the homeowner. This middle aged woman answers the door and is PISSED AS FUCK! But not at me. I tell her my name and contact info and that I would gladly pay to replace her mailbox. She was on the phone with her husband having an all out shouting match while her toddler is screaming at her. She blows me off and never bothered to contact me about the mailbox. I plow on like a good little delivery soldier.

I'm now on a long, looking out my passenger window in the direction I'm going. My speedometer read somewhere between 0 and 5 MPH but there's no way I was going that slow. That's when I truly understood that the speedometer tells you how fast the wheels are rotating, NOT how fast you are moving.

So this all starts some ~20 months ago, somewhere in his late 20's, still lives with his mother, in an unkept house. At first I only delivered there once a month, but that steadily increased to about once every 2 weeks. Then I come into work one day and there is a card waiting for me. Apparently 'John' come into the store during lunch to leave me a card. Deliveries increase to about once a week, and John asks me for my name every time, even though I wear a name badge. One day I'm handing 'John' his delivery and he mentions he enjoys drawing. I make the obligatory ""Oh really? That's cool."" He promises to draw something for me for 'next time'. When I come into my next shift, my drawing from 'John'. It is a drawing of me, I did get your picture

Around October/November last year I take a fair amount of time off work for exams and such. I come back before Christmas and 'John' now orders twice a week, and he hands me a small pile of drawings and 2 Christmas cards. One card and 2 drawings are for me (even though he still doesn't remember my name), and one card and 2 drawings for the rest of the people at the store. By this point in time, when he orders the managers make a point of saying ""Hey DeliveryGirl, your best friend just put in an order"" to tease me. I should also note, he still asks me for my name every time I deliver.

Again I take some time off for Christmas and new years, I have no choice but to take it. He seems to be ordering many times a week, or he drops into the store during lunch and leaves notes for me. He starts leaving notes asking if we enjoy his pictures, if we would like more, and he asks for me to write down my name for him. On deliveries I say to him ""Yes, we enjoy your pictures, and my name is DeliveryGirl."" Now I'm swapping deliveries with the other drivers to avoid 'John' which no one complains about because he's near the store. The other drivers come back with notes for me, birth date

I work at a fairly large Pizza Chain. I get paid 7.25 an Hour. I deliver maybe 8 times per 5 hour shift. Each delivery has averaged about 8 miles per delivery. The employer charges customers either 3.00 or 4.00 dollars per delivery based on distance. Of that I get either .50 or 1.00 depending on the distance.

- - -

Answer:

8 deliveries x 8 miles = 64 miles
8 deliveries x $1 = $8

$8 / 64 miles = 12.5 cents per mile

If it costs you more than 12.5 cents per mile to operate your car

The average price for gas here is $3.47 today. Say your car gets about 19 MPG city. (http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/findacar.htm)

$3.47 / 19 MPG = 18.2 cents per mile just for gas alone. You are DEFINITELY being under reimbursed for your car expenses (and that is even ignoring your costs for tires, depreciation, insurance and licensing.)

I began working at a ""Pizza Place"" in a small town in the midwest when I was 15 answering phones and folding boxes and being a general bitch boy for the store. It was owned and operated by a family of carnies(no joke)  and was the definition of a mom and pop store. Once I turned 16 I was promoted to delivery driver and never looked back.  There aren't many more perfect jobs when you're in high school than pizza delivery.  You literally get paid to drive around and get stoned and listen to music.

Anyways, and this pizza place basically served the entire town. We had a Papa John's too but who orders that shit when you can get carnie pizza that is legitimately delicious in a greasy, hear yourself getting fatter kinda way. Can you say hand pinched sausage on a pizza? Fuck yes.  So to say this place had regulars was an understatement.  After about a year or so I could hear an address and picture the house and the person who would answer the door, and usually what they ordered.

There was this guy who would order at least once, no tip, no tip""  as I handed her beer and sandwiches. Then the strange shit began.  The dude had obviously sustained some kind of serious injury in his life to his back or legs or both.  Some days he would answer the door, albeit very slowly, in an upright walking position. Sometimes though, he would take about five minutes to get to the door while scooting on his butt from his bedroom to the front door. I would tell him his total, lets say it was $7.95, and the amount he was short by gradually increased from spare change to a dollar or two each time.  I never really said anything. Once when his mom answered the door, smacked her on the ass and told her to get in there and eat before he ""had his way with her again"" or something like that. 

Gradually his mobility got a lot worse.  It became common knowledge that instead of knocking when he ordered, usually around noon, in the heat of the day, he would just open his window and have me walk right up to it.  I began to notice that even on days when it hadn't rained in weeks, there would be puddles and mud just underneath his window........and the thick smell of death was usually in the air.  That's right, this mother fucker was pissing and shitting (in god knows what) and dumping it right out his window in the front yard and I was walking through it and standing in it and collecting his poop dollars. And usually losing money on it.

1352702214.0,131vzp,Not letting non-tippers get to you,PJveteran,28,8,11,"Nights where you get lots of non-tippers (like tonight where the roads were very bad) can be frustrating especially because if you let the non-tippers ""get to you""

Unusual conditions like tonight's conditions bring out a different crowd

You can't let bad streaks get to you or you're not going to last in this job.

A handful of strategies:

**Saving up enough money to weather the bad streaks**: if you're going into work thinking ""I have to have a good night or I won't have enough to pay my rent"" you're gonna have a bad time and your coworkers are gonna hate you for acting like a dick.  You need enough cash reserves to pay a month's living expenses *and* a major car repair at all times.  If you don't have that much

**Giving non-tippers the benefit of the doubt (to spare your blood pressure)**: Old people and welfare cases generally don't tip, yet they find it hard to get out for whatever reason, and they're getting by on a fixed income. Old folks in particular are from a different era, they probably don't understand how important tips are.

Now if said 'hard case' is ordering several times a week

**Don't retaliate to their face**: You can't use two personas - friendly server vs. S.O.B. who's not taking guff from bad customers - and not let the latter leak into the former.  It's going to stress you out because there is a non-money aspect to the job, even if you're not getting tipped.  So you have to be very underhanded in how you retaliate, while (to their face) sympathizing with the customer.

Probably the ""nastiest"" I get, catching their attention, and repeatedly circling a big fat ""ZERO"" on the tip line of the customer copy.  This has gotten some tips from people who meant to tip but honestly forgot to write anything in.

**Anecdotes**

There's one guy who used to order from our store, but sometimes two pizzas.  If I saw his address coming up, I'd steal his pizza and run it over to the local bar, telling the folks inside, ""I've got this order with no name on it, did anyone order (whatever)?  Please say yes so I can go home.""  Someone would take it and I'd get $15-$20 of pure profit.  Meanwhile No-Tip Tommy has to wait an hour to discover his pizza has gone missing and flips out.  The last time this happened to him, he lost his shit over the phone and never ordered again.

Another hard case orders a ton of food at least once a week.  He's morbidly obese and I think he eats it all by himself.  I'll take his order and steal a pizza out of it, sir.  I'll have the store make a new one and send it out right away, no charge.  Another delivery fee for me, plus the tip from the re-purposed pizza.  Cha-ching!",,False,,False,t3_131vzp

So I drop her off at her dorm and heads back to the shop. On the way back I notice a cop car driving super slow down the bike bath.  He sees me drive by with my car topper gettin it's shine on and pulls me over.  He tells me that a drunk 20 year old girl escaped from the hospital and someone saw her get into a pizza delivery car.  I told him it wasn't me but I'd ask the other drivers at the store and took his number. He told me she's an idiot because they had her purse and cell phone.

I've been at this since about the beginning of June. So since i'm relatively new i still have trouble with some roads. Especially the ones out on the countryside. Well there is this small little community Just at the edge of the delivery area. I head out there but when i get to the place the house should be

So real quick i wanted to say that the mailboxes are at the edge of the road. So i never really looked into the yards of the houses im in front of. Also i just remembered there were no obvious street signs. 

So once i realize where i need to go i just looked over and there are three kids on the side of the street just staring at me. Me being 20 and no good with kids just kind of waved at them with an awkward smile then turned around and went to find the house. Well i delivered the order and had to pass the house with the kids again to get back to the store. 

I didn't think anything of it but when i turned the corner i see this man in the road waving me down. I'm really confused but stop to see what is up. He comes up to my window and starts like yelling at me. Asking me what i was doing. Why i talked to his kids. Saying i'm lucky he hasn't called the cops. I'm freaking out but calmly tell him i'm from a pizza shop. I showed him my hat and shirt and then thankfully i still had the ticket from the one order in my seat. I explained i was lost and that he can call my manager if he wanted. Then even gave him the phone number.

Luckily he quickly defused and was actually pretty cool with me. I said no worries i understand it was bad on my part. And i told him that i understand he was looking out for his kids. So it ended good but for those few moments i was scared out of my mind. 

Also few things to clear things up. No i do not have a sign on my car. Umm the neighborhood was nice so its not like they had a lot to worry about when it comes to their kids playing. And he did not end up calling the manager.

Calling again,tell him I'm coming back if I don't get a response (We have that kind of relationship xD I tell him stuff, he nods and keeps making food.) Call again...this time actually disconnected by him mid-ring. So fuck him, I drive back.

This past Thursday I was holding down the fort until the night crew came in, Thursday Round Lake must've been having a meeting of some sort because they ordered 6 pizzas. This isn't really too big of a deal, it takes ten minutes to make them and you can have them all through the oven in probably 15 or 20. The problem was that they wanted their pizzas around 10:00 PM, and we were only open until 9. That meant someone would have to stay over a full hour after we close to make and deliver these pizzas. I talked to my manager and told them the situation and she asked me to call them back and see if delivery at 9:30 would be a problem, which it wasn't. 

Well, he was going to have to cancel all these plans. I could see both sides to the situation, but it wasn't my problem so I just said sorry and left.

Sunday rolls around and I am holding down the fort with another worker until the evening crew comes in, apparently on that Thursday delivery his car broke down and he was out until midnight. Every since Thursday he has been having car trouble, management knows this and doesn't care. They could easily call someone else in to drive, but they are throwing these deliveries on M.

I recall advice given to me by Domino's employees, if you're ever in an accident and have drank anything, get out of there if you can. You'll be towed and impounded, but you avoid legal troubles of driving under the influence. So I offer her a ride to her boyfriend. She accepts. Boyfriend super pissed off at her and telling her she deserves a DUI, and I'm thinking

&gt;Well I drop her off and her boyfriend thanks me. Then I call my girlfriend, why did I get her out of there? I'm happy no one was hurt, but someone could have been, badly. Even I could've been caught up in that accident somehow, so maybe I should've just gave her the spot to sit and await her fate. I think her boyfriend was taking her back there anyway, so maybe justice all worked itself out. But I guess I aided and embedded a drunk driver, which might've been pretty retarded. She seemed sober, so maybe it was nothing. She just might've had some drinks earlier and sobered up. But still, but I guess maybe it wasn't the right thing to do.

I used to deliver in the uk, I had to give it to the nearest five and the customer got 4pence off.

Similarly as a customer, but to my knowledge no one else really tips either, occassionally I'll just round up to a pound, and once I tipped about £3 quid, but that was purely because I had 15 20p's to get rid of.

We have two insiders at our derpy little pizza place, if not a touch nosy.

If there's anything that didn't make the cut (no pun intended), he'll be on it like white on rice. Occasionally, this will lead to him being preoccupied and missing a phone call or something. No big deal. 

My REAL gripe is with Joe. You may have wondered why I mentioned the fact that Brandon has Asperger's. Well, no joke) and completely forget to answer the phone. Furthermore, he's threatened each of us at least once. Now, take note that he doesn't have the grunt to back it up, but he still does it, even if it's half in jest.

For example: I have my keys on a carabiner. I was standing by the oven while he was folding boxes, if that had hit me, I would have smashed all these boxes over your head."" Like, what the fuck?!

   We had a fairly regular customer that would order from our shop quite a bit. Typical ghetto female, never tipping etc. One day she calls up and as I am confirming her address as I do for every customer she informs me that she moved. No big deal, I ask her for her new address. Turns out she has moved just outside of our delivery area.

  ""I'm sorry ma'am but you are now outside of our delivery area. I do know the store that delivers to your new address

 She instantly turns on that ghetto attitude and is already yelling at me.

 ""No I called the right store! You guys always deliver to me! I have been ordering from you for years!""

  ""I understand that ma'am

  ""I called **your** store and I want **your store** to deliver to me!""

  At this point I was fed up with this customer

  ""I'm sorry ma'am but there is nothing I can do. You moved out of our delivery area and we cannot deliver to your new residence. Our will not be delivering your pizza today. Call (other pizza shop) and they will deliver to you. Now is there anything else I can do for you today?""

   Click. I breathed a sigh of relief because I thought we were finally done dealing with this pain in the butt customer. *sigh* However all is never how it seems.

   Come the next day I get a call from my District Manager.

   ""Alphamale063 did you refuse to deliver to superghettofemale yesterday?""

   ""No sir I did not refuse to deliver to her

I've been working at a local pizza restaurant for over a year now and usually receive 3 dollars per delivery + the tip I get. We don't have a delivery fee so this comes out of the owners pocket. That being said

Now

Here's the thing:

-The work load has increased a lot. Even though the owner ""helps"" me when we're busy

-There have been plenty of times where I leave with 3 deliveries and there's 2 more orders that were placed 10 minutes ago, and he's been there the entire time just chilling in front of his computer. This results in me being late (we tell them 45 minutes), not getting tipped, and probably losing the customer.

-On saturday I took 28 deliveries and would have made the exact same amount if I was getting paid 3 dollars per delivery.

-Yesterday I took 23 deliveries and given my 11 hour shift

-I'm working a lot of overtime and not being accommodated for that. That being said

TLDR: I went from making 3 dollars per delivery to 7 dollars an hour working 11-12 hour shifts and not making much more than I would have with the previous wages.

I paid my way through college delivering in Amherst, Amherst draws in a lot of spoiled people and it shows. Despite mostly stingy customers and aside from the ebs and flows it was great money. 

It was really interesting observing all these people, I treat people how I want to be treated but there's no other word to describe them. There's no avoiding the ugliness and it came from all angles - customers, pedestrians, drunks, drivers, drunk drivers, and even sometimes coworkers.

I've come to take a different view on humanity than I had before this job, myself, and my fellow drivers I've realized that we take our civilized nature for granted. There will always be miserable people that try to pass it on and there will always be narrow minds. The way they express their angst just depends on where you are in the world. Be you terrorist, spoiled princess or orange bro from New Jersey - we are all capable of feeling and expressing the same malice. The key is to realize it and catch yourself. Sorry for the tangent.

There are plenty of things I liked about the job. I got to rock out, unfortunately I'm completely aloof. More so a minute delay than aloof - but that's long enough to turn a good deal sour.

I worked for four years on and off. I did overnight shifts 12 to 5 as a student, 16 hours, St. Patties day. This is the 4th time that I've left Domino's.

Real quick

I've delivered to this guy before. He's 8(""5 mile radius"") miles out and when I delivered to him, the other store tells the customer to call our store if they live on X road. Why they do this, I don't know. Technically, the owners have it as to where we deliver out there and the other store doesn't, even though inefficient as it is.  The owners said ""Quit then"" when the drivers and managers brought it up.

Back to the story:

I let my manager know this guy doesn't tip and he sees that I'm a little flustered. He tells me to tell him(my manager) how much I get tipped. I'm heading out with his one $20.11 pepperoni pizza. Don't need the GPS on how to get this guy's apartment. I get there and his light isn't on. I knock

Usual greeting, that's going to be $20.11"". Hands me a $20 bill and I hear him going for the change. Gives me $1 in dimes and nickles(and the rest is tip...thanks..). Still fine. Not going to lose control. Before he closes the door, I very calmly and nicely say to him ""Hey, just to let you know, our ____ store is a lot closer than our store. If you want to get it faster, you should just call them(or something along those lines). It's about 8 miles out here and 4.5 from our ___ store"". When I first said ""___ store"", he starts shaking his head at me the entire time I'm talking.  He says ""You know, they say you are closer"". Repeat distance to him.  Doesn't really listen to me. Say good-bye

Oh

I clock out and just ponder the ""loves our store"". I've worked at this pizza place for a while and he's never been in the store. All the delivery guys at my store hate him and the food is literally the same food from the other store. All that is different are the delivery drivers. 

Sorry, I hate the fact this guy can't understand the distance between the stores(The other store would accept his delivery if he insisted) and tip, if at all, really shitty for driving all the way out there. I hate putting people down on where they live but where he was, he could afford a few dollars for tip. Hope you had a better night than I did.

[Topic of the Week: The ""rules"" for delivery.](http://gregspages.com/discussion/viewtopic.php?f=46&amp;t=1510)

What are the ""rules"" for delivery? Are they universal? Is one rule better than another different way? What are the 'rules' at your store?

To me

1: Rotation is sacred. (You don't jump or skip rotation with out permission of those ahead of you.)

2. The oldest COMPLETE order goes first. (We always try to take the 'top (oldest) order on the screen but if it is waiting on a remake (usually at least a 6 minute delay) then you take the next order. If they arent just coming out of the oven out of order

3. If a driver forgets and item for a delivery, if the customer says something was 'forgotten' (they forgot to ask for it or the phone person forgot to enter the item) then that item is put on a new ticket and is delivered IAW rotation.

4. Nothing gets you out of rotation except being taken ""off the road"". (this prevents drives from skipping known stiffs by getting 'busy' doing something else in the store such as taking a phone order, or supposedly taking a crap. Unless the manager on duty (MOD) says you are ""off the road"", then we will skip you and leave 'your' order on the rack for you to deliver. 8-)

5. Drivers never 'cross' the store. When deciding which orders go together to make a double or more, or a east and a west. A run VERY CLOSE to the store might be an exception to this, but don't get greedy!

OK. So what did I forget

I currently work retail but I would like to deliver 3-4 evenings/nights out of the week as well.

I'm guessing working Thursday-Sunday would be the busiest out of the week?

In my area there is a papa johns and a dominos hiring.

As far as the areas go I am not sure where I should work as far as $/hr goes after tips and all.

Here are a few of the locations

Both Dominos and Papa Johns are hiring
The locations are sorted from the closest to my house to farthest away. 

They are all within 20 minutes from my house

1354656522.0,14a6th,Rants From My Old Blog: Part 1 - General Hatred of Shitty Customers,antonehenry,13,7,13,"Hi reddit!  I heard that this existed today.  I'll start posting these as a series.  I hope you enjoy them.  This is just the general anger I used to feel.  I've got a couple of crazy stories coming after this.  

&gt;This has been on my back burner for a long time. But I have a bone to pick with the many people that order pizza from the Domino's at the U of M. From now on, leaders of student organizations, black people, asian people, and drunken douche bags that don't know how to order a pizza.

&gt;Let's start with the inciting incident for this late night rant. A man calls us up 20 minutes before close. I take his order........

&gt;-Thanks for choosing Domino's
-Hi
-For carryout or delivery?  
-Delivery.  
-Okay
-Pioneer Hall.  
-Alright
-Oh  
-And is your phone number 555-555-5555?  
-Yea.  
-So you would like a large pepperoni
-Um. Hold on. (chatter with friends for a full minute) Uh
-Alright
-Hold on. (give it another 30 seconds or so) No dude
-Alright your total is $15.56
-Whoa! Why is it so much? Isn't it like $4.99?  
-If you have a coupon.  
-We have the daily card or whatever.  
-Okay
-Dude
-A medium one topping is $4.99 after 10.  
-Oh. One second (faster this time) We'll get a medium.   
-Okay
-Yea
-Okay
-What? Why? I thought it's six bucks?  
-Sorry
-That's fucking gay.  
-Yea
-Hold on. (bitching about price in background) Okay.  
-Are you paying with cash or credit?  
-Credit  
-Your card number please?  
-Hold on. Okay
-The card number please?  
-(Gives number)  
-Alright
-Cool.  
-Have a good night.  

&gt;Lucky me, and we want to go home, I proclaim, ""If he calls for his pizza, tough shit. We're closed."" So of course, the other driver cashes in on the extra pizza, takes on bite, but answer the phone next time. Guy calls back 2 minutes later and I answer.

&gt;-Thanks for choosing Domino's
-I know
-Oh yes
-Yea
-Your delivery was supposed to be mine
-My phone didn't ring. I was in the lobby
-We can't get into the dorms without getting a hold of you first
-Well dude
-I promise you I did. I'm sorry. It's not in anyone's benefit to not be able to make a delivery. We don't get paid and our customer isn't happy.  
-Okay. Are you going to charge my card still?  
-Nope.  
-How do I know that?  
-Your card was charged
-Okay. (very distraught at this point)  
-Again
-Yea. (hangs up)  

&gt;Now, about 60% of the time you answer on the first call. You say, ""oh i'm sorry, i don't answer numbers i don't know,"" but you just order a pizza 20 minutes ago. I tell you I will be there in three minutes, and ask you very politely to meet me at the front door. You take seven and then give me a three cent tip after I delivered your pizza in seventeen fucking minutes and you got it for 6.97 when normally it would be 14 bucks. You just saved 7 dollars and the most you can ever afford to give me is two bucks. Fuck you. Seriously, fuuuuuuuck you. Tonight you order 24 pizzas that were delivered at 9:30 on the dot, when at full price it would be 250 at least. You give me 10 bucks. Less than 10% on your discounted price. You order 35 pizzas on Friday. I was there right on time again, fuck you.

&gt;Now

&gt;-1-2 pizzas at menu price. 2 bucks is average, 5 bucks is amazing.  
-1-2 pizzas at half price. Throw in an extra buck
-3-4 pizzas
-5-6. extra buck.  
-Orders of 40-50 bucks. Shoot for 15%
-100+ bucks. Please for the love of satan
-Anything higher than that, baking, and cutting them all. Show some fucking respect. We respected you enough to get them to your doorstep on time.  

&gt;Oh, or go to the grocery store. 

&gt;Line of the year by far though. This family has ALWAYS tipped a dollar. My co-worker, as per usual, ""I'd tip you better, but, you know, the economy."" 

Well there's a look into my 24 year old mind toward the end of seven years of delivering pizzas.  I hope you enjoy the read.

It was 10:50 when this guy placed an order (we close at 11). I took his order, so I was doomed to take it to him.

He ordered $26 worth of food (2 larges

Now

I went into his run-down apartment and pushed the buzzer. Of course, if you were expecting me, you should be ready! After 3 buzzing attempts, he finally said ""Yuh?"" (I could tell he was beyond stoned).

I said ""Uhh

Finally he answered it
Skinny white dude with chinstrap beard, baggy shorts. Do I need to mention that they had numerous pockets? And lastly, he was holding a **baby**!

He goes ""How much?""
""26""
""Uhkay""

He reached into his wallet with one hand while still holding the baby. I'm surprised he didn't drop him. He pulled out a 50 bill.
Now

I said ""I can't take a 50.""
""Oh man
""I can't make change for it""
""Uhkay""

He pulled his wallet back out of his pants and handed me a twenty and a ten (why didn't he do this before?)

He then said ""Just give me 4 back bro""

In my mind, and I had to stay professional.

So, and the delivery time ended up being late!

I didn't get out of the store until after 1:30 because of that guy.
