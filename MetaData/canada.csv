I'm tired of reading about how everyone who lives in the Maritimes should just up and move and stop being an economic drain on everyone else. I'm tired of reading about how Natives are a problem. That rural Canadians and Northerners are a problem; that greedy boomers are a problem; that entitled young people are a problem; that immigrants are a problem; that basically every goddamned group that is not already making good money and working in the best economic areas of this country are a problem to those who do.

The idea that everyone should look out for themselves and fuck everyone else bothers me. Ayn Rand's philosophy has never bolstered a country to success as far as I am aware, tolerance and understanding. Why are these considered weak or ridiculous?

I know this rant will just spur on more of the same, which is fine. I just have sat back and watched this place become a cesspool devoid of actual, respectful discussion.

Of course, Russia, Iran and Saudi Arabia in having warrantless access to subscriber information about internet users. 

The reason this pisses off so many Canadians is because we are among the most voracious internet users in the world. In Canada there is no pressing need to take steps toward a surveillance society

How can we make this bill as politically costly as possible for Harper? 

Edit begins below this line 
---

Firstly, even though I am personally skeptical that all MPs actually read their mail. I hope that it's just the beginning of an actual relationship with your elected representative, and that you all keep an eye on what they say and how they are voting. 

My own ideas weren't that great. However, I will quote user Kedive right here:

&gt; ""I think we should hit Mr. Harper where it hurts and mobilize people to spread Mr. Harpers message of diminishing freedoms to where it can hurt him the most. In his home riding of Calgary Southwest. If we can convince enough people from his riding to contact him on this I think it might possibly make him do a double take on this bill if he feels his support from his major center is not behind him on this.""

I say take this one step further, 1080p professional-style footage. I would emphasize the Conservatives that disagree with the bill, because after all, these are the same people who want to abolish the gun registry and the long form census. It's a logically consistent position to hold. I think we can actually find common ground with each other on the internet, which is a great way to bring people of different political views together. 

I'm absolutely sure you guys could come up with a winning script for this hypothetical clip in another thread, either a video goes viral or it doesn't - plus I think the term is kind of annoying). We could even upload the interview footage and crowd-source the editing. We need to show the public directly that almost all Canadians that use the internet are against this bill, not just the young people. Personally speaking I have talked to students, older people, a soccer mom and even someone studying to be a police officer that think this bill is a bad idea. However, I will admit I live in Québec so maybe I have a little sample bias. Either way, I would love to see this ball get rolling. Writing your MPs is one thing, however, we all have a lot at stake. I'm all for protecting our children

I was waiting in an out-the-door line at Tim Hortons to get a bite to eat. A few seconds after I arrived a man came from inside and stood behind me. The woman in front of me asked him what he did to get sent to the back of the line. He replied that he went to go find a seat for his grandmother before and had lost his place.

Almost everyone originally behind him then offered him back his spot. At first he politely refused saying he would just wait. Of course everyone continued to insist that he takes back his spot in line for being such a good grandson. In the end he was forced to take back his spot closer to the front of the line.

The exchange:

&gt;**Mr. Bruce Hyer (Thunder Bay—Superior North
    Madam Speaker
    I have a broad question for the minister. Does he really believe in science and the implications of scientific inquiry? I have a more specific question that will put a fine point on it. There is a vast bunch of science out there that says that life was created on this planet three to four billion years ago

&gt;**Hon. Gary Goodyear:**
    Madam Speaker
    What I can say is that we obviously support basic research all the way through to applied research. In fact, we are investing in i basic research for the pipeline of the future and applying it so that we can create jobs today.
    The question is this: Will that member support this budget or reject it like he always has?

My friend has a long story. Of canadian origin

Already abused as a child

Asking his father for helping him with living expenses (he is a student), he was imediately flewn in to Lahore, Pakistan. He can live with his uncle. In Lahore, his father took away the canadian passport and got him a fake pakistani one. New name, new DOB. One time he was in such a bad condition that he tried to commit suicide. He broke both of his legs, bringing him into the wheelchair. As the father (which is the canadian part of the parents) refuses to pay any therapy, it will take about 8 months until he will able to walk again. 
His uncle and his daughter hit him every day. The daughter hurts his already injured legs, but since there was not enough evidence they couldn't do anything for him. Other family members are on the uncles side or refuse to listen to his problems. He can go to college and has his own cellphone, computer time is limited. He doesn't know who to contact.

Social service? 
Canadian embassy?

[Relevant

[Also somewhat relevant

***Edit: Damn

People seem to be very confused about a few poor excuses put out by the CRTC or phone companies to make excuses for our high costs that simply are not true.

The largest misconception seems to be that ""Canada is huge and it costs way more to cover such a large area""


***&lt;1&gt;***

I do not mean to steal credit for this there has been a ton of great comments that explain why this is bullshit I am just trying to put this right up at the top to clear this issue up and inform the public of a very common bullshit excuse for expensive costs. 

Did this using stats from the 2006 Census:

Population of Canada: 31

If people still want to argue after this I can break down the exact population density of every province but I am lazy and going to use the stats available for all of Canada and a few of the super under populated provinces. 

Canada = 9, I could break this down even further to get this point across but Nunavut alone is 1,936,113km^2 large that is almost 21% of our landmass alone and guess what only 32,435 people live there, a lot of which are government or army employees which use a completely different communications system. I can't say for sure because I've never been there but I am willing to bet MAYBE 1% of that land mass if at all has PUBLIC cell coverage. 

There is still the north west territories which is almost as large and under populated so another 20% (rough estimate getting sick of math) of area that maybe 1-2% of has cell coverage. 

So right there is about 40% of our land mass that only has/requires 1-3% cell coverage

So while yes Canada is a HUGE land mass, using our size as an excuse for expensive service is just nonsense. 

***&lt;2&gt;*** 

Wind mobile has some awesome plans BUT they are not available everywhere nor do I think they plan to ever be available everywhere


***&lt;3&gt;***

Some of the retarded excuses I've heard people make on part of the telecommunications companies for price gouging us seriously have made the schizo in me think there are PR people from those companies making up bullshit in this thread and I don't think I even have to point out which ones those are and why they are wrong. 


***&lt;4&gt;***

I don't mean to sound arrogant or seem like I am not listening to both sides of the story by posting this edit

If you do the research into any excuse given by the CRTC or the big telecom giants for why we are paying so much you fill find holes in all their bullshit excuses

Sorry if I missed a comment on how we can do this but so far the only thing I've seen suggested was by kidl33t and while I think his idea would give me some self satisfaction knowing we are costing the companies money it does not address the actual issue and will probably just raise prices or force them to stop offering free call hours. 

Please if anyone has any actual ideas on how we can try to fight this send me a message for my skype or other contact information so we can organize and finally take a stand! 

I know openmedia has been questioning the CRTC but I see no easy way to get involved with them and address the pricing issues head on. 

[They do have this going on right now


One more quick edit

Since this got such a good response and a lot more people will be reading this tomorrow, I have no idea how this is legal but I assume this goes unnoticed by a lot of people, if you call about it and complain they will obviously fix the ""error"" but I wonder how many people don't notice and how much extra money they make from these ""errors""...
  

***Another edit I feel I should put here that is a very important point brought up by a few people in comments (I apologize this is turning into one hell of a long post

Part of the telecommunications act has been brought up by a few people this is very basically what it does (one evil part of it anyways

""The Telecommunications Act limits foreign ownership to 20% of a company's voting shares

It is VERY expensive for the initial start up costs to put the infrastructure in place required to provide cell service

The telecommunications act combined with the ban hammer the CRTC has over everything are a HUGE part of why we are paying so much. 

And because of this a lot of the ""alternative"" cell phone companies have no option but to lease usage of the infrastructure already put into place by the 3 big telecom giants in Canada (Bell
This limits their ability to set prices at exactly what they want or offer services not offered by those companies. 

I think it is a great idea to have Canadian companies do things in Canada **in theory**

I have been avoiding the topic of wired broadband / internet prices but it also suffers from the same flaws because the same laws apply to these services as well.

For years the Canadian telecom companies have been running away with record profits on the back of questionable and sometimes downright predatory practices. The rates have been going up

A few particularly egregious examples:

(1) Does anyone else remember when cell phone companies used to send out a text message to warn you when you were near or over your data cap? Well apparently not any more. A couple of recent surprise bills are what put me over edge with Rogers. The same exact thing just happened to my wife on Bell. There is no other way to describe this than predatory.

(2) Data caps for high-speed internet are still pitifully low in Canada. Why do we still get the same service level that they were selling in 2003? Price goes up and you get the same thing. We are falling behind the rest of the world on this one.

(3) All of these companies have one price that they advertise

(4) 3 year contracts... WHY?

(5) Not sure if this is the case for anyone else but when I signed up I got an amazing deal

(6) How does Bell justify charging $30+ per month for home phone in 2013? Check out Fongo

These are just a few of the nightmarish examples of being a customer of a big telecom company in Canada. But it doesn't have to be this way

**These are symptoms of a system without any real competition or oversight.**

So what can we do to really hurt these giants? All we need to do is put a small dent in their bottom line and they will listen up!

Recently, I bet they cover your area too.

In my experience the service has been impeccable. And while some might worry about how much they might spend when they travel outside of the home coverage areas, I don't feel like I am dealing with a company trying to screw me every chance they get. 

**The service is good, and Fuck Bell (and if my experience with these companies is at all typical, you probably agree with me)**

**EDIT:** A lot of people are commenting on the fact that people in small towns have only 1 option for these services. You have just as much to gain if the big telecom companies start to see real competition from new upstarts. You should be telling anyone you know who does have alternatives to take advantage of them!

Also turdovski gave a link to [this company](http://mobility.petro-canada.ca/default.aspx) that has ultra-cheap prices but still runs on the national Rogers network. 

**EDIT2:** Added (4) and (5). Also some people have suggested that missed text warnings are an error and you just need to call an complain. Did that recently with Bell and they gave a small concession and forced my wife into a more expensive plan with no more MY10. This was the last straw that forced me to make this rant.

1311681953.0,j0348,Good Luck Mr. Layton,PhedreRachelle,1196,410,54,"""My fellow New Democrat

I wanted to share this with you first.

On February 5th,000 other Canadian men every year, had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. 

I have received overwhelming support from my loving family, and thousands of everyday Canadians. 
Their stories and support have touched me. And I have drawn strength and inspiration from them. 

In the closing days of the most recent session of the House of Commons
After the House rose

My battle against prostate cancer is going very well. My PSA levels remain virtually undetectable. 

However, also indicate that I have a new, non-prostate cancer that will require further treatment. 

So

I will therefore be taking a temporary leave of absence as Leader of the New Democratic Party of Canada. I'm going to fight this cancer now
To that end, consult our Parliamentary caucus and then convene a meeting of our party's federal council to appoint an interim leader. 
The interim leader will serve until I resume my duties. 
I intend to do so when Parliament meets on September 19th. 
I am also making a recommendation on who the interim leader should be. 

I suggest that Hull-Aylmer MP Nycole Turmel be named interim leader during this period. 

Ms. Turmel enjoys unanimous support as the national chair of our Parliamentary caucus. She is an experienced national leader in both official languages. And she will do an excellent job as our national interim leader. 

Let me conclude by saying this. 

If I have tried to bring anything to federal politics

We CAN look after each other better than we do today. We CAN have a fiscally responsible government. We CAN have a strong economy; greater equality; a clean environment. 

We CAN be a force for peace in the world. 

I am as hopeful and optimistic about all of this as I was the day I began my political work

I am hopeful and optimistic about the personal battle that lies before me in the weeks to come. 

And I am very hopeful and optimistic that our party will continue to move forward. 

We WILL replace the Conservative government

And we WILL work with Canadians to build the country of our hopes

Of our dreams

Of our optimism

Of our determination

Of our values...

Of our love. 

Thank you. 

Jack Layton""

I have no doubt that should there be an attack on Iran, if not actually involved in the attack itself. Allow me to explain why this would be a stupid idea.

Indeed, bombing Iran would pave the way for a military coup which would further worsen the human rights situation for Iranians. So surely, that can't be the reason.

Iran supports armed groups outside its borders. So does the United States. So do any number of countries. This is nothing new, and internationally speaking, there is no consensus on whether groups like Hamas or Hezbollah are terrorist groups or political entities - it depends on your point of view.

Lastly, if people are willing for fall for the same trick twice they deserve what they get - but I hope Canadians are more intelligent and skeptical than the United States was during the Bush years. 

So what is the real reason? Why is Iran such a target? One need look no further than beneath the soil that they're living on. 

Iran has the world's 2nd largest reserves of natural gas and 4th largest reserves of crude oil. It may sound cynical but I think we all know in the back of our minds that there are many regimes that get away with much

Now is a critical moment for us to all wake up and realize the true danger of what is happening. The ""War on Terror"" was planned. Afghanistan, now Syria - all stepping stones to the ultimate prize - Iran. We are one false-flag event, one Gulf of Tonkin incident away from a shooting war with Iran, and coincidentally our biggest ally has carrier groups sitting in the Persian gulf awaiting orders. 

Iran is not a threat to global peace. They haven't attacked any country. I don't know if I can say the same for our southern neighbour. 

I truly hope Canada doesn't fall into the trap

Your thoughts?  

edit: I didn't expect this post to get so many upvotes

1. I don't believe Canada would ever unilaterally attack Iran

2. The top voted response says that a war with Iran is unlikely. I would caution against being complacent about this. You have Israel's right-wing PM repeatedly saying that a military option may be the only one

3. A war doesn't mean an invasion - in fact I think the top military brass would agree with me that it's a terrible idea. Bombing Iran and destroying nuclear as well as oil

Lastly I'd like to add that I was born and raised in Canada, Libya, Iran or anyone else - I truly believe that it makes us all worse off even if our heart is in the right place. That is just my opinion, and I welcome a thorough debate on the merits of Canada becoming a junior officer in the world police.

I ended up cancelling my contract and signing up with Bell. My new plan with them is not great

I know this is a long, but rather that I don't think I should have to. For my bill to increase by $30/month for the same amount of data seems totally iimnsane.

___________________________
I've been #IdleTooLong about this whole topic

First, I'd like to paint my thoughts for you with much broader strokes.

I'm so very proud of my culture. The way the plains Indians lived on this land was a fantastic example of community, ingenuity, and spirituality. I'm proud of the native inspired tattoos that I sport permanently on my body. As a father, I'm teaching my son that same respect and understanding of where his blood derives from, in the hopes that his pride will outshine the prejudice he will inevitably experience growing up, or at some point in his life.

I'm also very proud to be Canadian. Our vast mosaic of cultures, we all have the same citizenship, but some have a different view on the value of it.

I don't pretend to know all the ins and outs of the government bills, but I've intently watched news stories, read columns, and have regularly monitored the comments being made on facebook. Based on all of this, I feel the need to break my silence on this issue.

1 - It's embarrassing how the #IdleNoMore protest is being handled.
Blocking major traffic thoroughfares does nothing good to bring support and awareness to your cause

Clarify what you are protesting for, respected, justified for being mistreated, or the preservation of your culture, then let's be out with it and start a constructive discussion.

Understand that you do not need to be consulted for anything any more than the Canadian citizen next to you does. Your opinion on things doesn't count ""more"" than anyone else's.
Respect is earned

There's no question that the native people of yesterday were brutalized, and humiliated for decades. It's awful, and no one should ever have to suffer like that. The elders of the time signed those treaties to bring peace, and offer what they hoped would be a leg-up in a new world that they realized couldn't be held at bay. But those days are long over. It defies logic to have the current population pay for the tragedies committed by people that came so long before them.

The preservation of your culture is YOUR job, Irish, and Ukrainian societies thrive all over the country with very little or no support from government coffers. They celebrate traditional dance, language, and food all by simply passing it down from generation to generation. Native communities can do the very same thing (and generally do), but without financial support.

2 - ""This movement is about the whole environment, forests, land, etc, so we need this bill to further protect our children's futures. Thanks to Harper Govt, rigs and development will pollute the air, waters

It's no secret that our Canadian economy is driven by the oil and gas industry. Yes, and powerful government offices in place that already have that very same sentiment at heart. Millions of Canadians support green technology and research, as well as lobby for stronger federal policy. So if that's what this is all about, there's no need to blockade anything, as a majority of people would already agree with you.

3 - ""It is about the 480 page Bill that the government has passed without you knowing about it. It went through the house of commons and the senate in 2 wks. 480 pgs long...do you think that many people had time to read it? It says that under age criminals can be punished as adults. It makes more budget cuts. The librarians at schools are being budget cut. It is about A LOT more than Aboriginals

Back in the days of copying notes off a blackboard or projector in school, I'm willing to bet that most could plow through that many pages in a very short period of time. I suppose the content would be laden with bureaucratic jargon and would need time to fully interpret...but that's why you have a legal team.
Quite frankly

Budget cuts are a reality of our democratic world. I'm not sure if this means that librarians from schools are being removed, our schools rely on a healthy economy for funding. When money gets tight, things get sacrificed. I truly hope that the readily available knowledge in a library would be the last to go.

4 - ""It's not about the Aboriginals! That is what they are doing to distract you from what it really is about! It only affects the aboriginals- just like it will effect ALL of us!""
This is very confusing

First and foremost, but I get the gist because I have used some of the special privileges provided to me. I do not pay for health care. I did for awhile in my young working life, but then the government discovered my native status and sent me a HUGE apology letter, and a cheque for every dime I had put into the system. Odd. I lived just up the street from my fellow truck driving friends, did the same job, paid the same taxes...yet there I was with this benefit because of my racial background and some papers that were signed all those years ago. I've used it for eye wear. This was particularly handy when I was “up against it” financially, but had broken my glasses welding. Here's the thing though, and it needs to stop.

I move that Canadians start their own march towards coast to coast equality, it's those that work hard to continue to stoke the flames of collective well being that matter.

As a man that stands by his word, and a hard working, forward thinking Canadian that believes the opportunities and advantages this country has to offer should be available to everyone equally.

First

We are dealing with... Complete corruption. This is absolutely draconian, actually! Here's one case study http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6BT03M20101230

This shit has got to go. But as far as I'm concerned

The CRTC is essentially in the back pocket of the two telecom conglomerates of our country

Therefore

We could always log onto our brokers en masse and naked short their stock until it goes to 0, such as a market crash.

However

We can either go the class action lawsuit route

I just wanted to know if this is viable... Or if you're all angry enough to participate in such an endeavor. 

I know I do.

Vive la Revolution.

""the act of reproducing all or any substantial part of [...music...] onto an audio recording medium for the private use of the person who makes the copy does not constitute an infringement of the copyright in the musical work

Further, [The Copyright Board of Canada further clarified](http://news.cnet.com/Canada-deems-P2P-downloading-legal/2100-1025_3-5121479.html?tag=st.rc.targ_mb) that P2P filesharing is a legitimate source of music for copying.

Stories [like this](http://www.nationalpost.com/news/canada/politics/story.html?id=3074841) where Industry Ministers think format-shifting music is illegal are either examples of gross incompetence or obvious propaganda for the music industry.

Do not let them convince the public that music copying in Canada is illegal.  It is NOT.  Point this out wherever and whenever you can.  I have provided the top link to back you up.

**edit**: The Conservatives are about to introduce proposed legislation

Do not ignore the media. Call bullshit. Post clarifying comments on their websites. Call the reporters who wrote the articles. Write letters to the editor. Call your MPs and set them straight. Do anything but ignore the grape kool-aid they want you to drink.

**edit 2**: Here is the Copyright Board clarification from December 12, second last paragraph.  (And for my Quebecois friends, the french version is on the right side!)

""*The regime does not address the source of the material copied. There is no requirement in Part VIII that the source copy be a non-infringing copy. Hence, or a track downloaded from the Internet.*""

**FindMichelleYu's Status:**
    Thank-you for joining us this past week in prayer and in action. This has been a difficult time for the Yu family and they have been overwhelmed by all the support and love they have received.

We are ecstatic to let you know that contact has been made with Michelle. She is safe. The family requests that you respect their privacy at this time.

Thank you again for all your help.

***
On Tuesday April 17th

None of her family or friends have heard from her since. Here are the important details:

1. It is uncharacteristic of her to run away. Her family and close friends do not believe this is likely. There were no major conflicts or disagreements in the family - and close friends have attested to this.

2. At 6pm on Tuesday

3. Her phone has been off since 3pm on Tuesday the 17th.

4. She has a heart condition that requires daily medication

  Considering the circumstances (especially her heart condition), and there are only a few minutes of local news coverage every night about this. This is why we NEED the internet to help spread her image, so that citizens can fill the void and effectively be this constant search party. It has been 4 days, and she could be anywhere in Canada by now if she has been abducted, so we have to inform people in Vancouver, Montreal, Calgary, Halifax

***What can you do?***

**1. Upvote this

**https://www.facebook.com/FindMichelleYu**

(Press the gear icon on the top right

Though liking the page will give you updates on the situation, we need **strangers** - people that are not closely connected to Michelle's friends' networks - to **really spread awareness and have the ""virality"" take off.** **This is why reddit may actually be *the* most important resource right now.** If you have not seen this story in your fb newsfeed recently, you actually have the greatest ability to help her. More degrees of separation = More unique people and more exposure, the better chance we have of finding Michelle.

**Edit 1:** Thanks all for the gracious replies. It's a bit overwhelming going through every post. I'm at work now

**Edit 2:** Here are my answers to some common questions asked. Sorry for the in-lines

&gt; **What was your former country?**

I should have known this would be mostly asked and should've mentioned it before. I am Lebanese

&gt; **Can you vote right away? Will you vote? Who will you vote for?**

I can, I'm voting ABH - anything but Harper.

&gt; **How long after the exam is the ceremony? Do you get the citizenship as soon as you go the ceremony?**

I had the ceremony two months after the exam. And yes

&gt; **Did you steal our jobs?**

Yes, I'll make some jobs back once I have my own business. :D

&gt; **would you care to share your story to the citizenry so one can get a good idea of what to deal with?**

I came here first with a student visa to pursue my master's degree in computer science. I was not sure at first if I'd settle for good in Canada. But then made up my mind and  started learning French to obtain my permanent residency status. The permanent residency application was the toughest if you ask me, skills, and work experience qualifies you for living in Canada. I got accepted and three years later, I would apply for citizenship. Flash forward 18 more months, and I'm a Canadian citizen, after passing a citizenship test two months ago.

Why did I decided to live in Canada? I landed first in Montreal and there is some charm in city that makes it feels like home only few months after living in. I loved the city, and culture (or multi-cultures) I've seen so far in Canada. I wouldn't say that settling in first was a breeze. It was not. But looking back where I was and where I am now and what plans I have for my future, I do realize I'm a different man now than before. Different as in better...

We really leveled with each other over the misrepresentation of Americans by the media and spent hours laughing and learning from each other.

Everywhere I went the people were friendly, and are willing to make compromises. Every now and then someone would drive slowly or hold up traffic a bit and most of the time I never heard the angry honking I am used to back home.

What surprised me most was how my view of the US changed - our laws seem draconic in comparison, and we're much more unwilling to compromise for the good of others (even in shit as minor as letting someone merge into traffic). 

Going across the border into the US was like entering a prison - dozens of cameras watching your every movement

It seemed like every 30 minutes we would look at each other and ask 'Why the hell do we not live here?' Canada is so much more representative of my beliefs and genuinely made me want to be as nice and outgoing as natives of BC. I intend to visit other cities and provinces in the future to get a real sampling of the whole country

* Some of this goes back to simply being by the ocean again, hills filled with trees into the horizon.  

* I know it's still illegal

*  The thing I love most is the patriotism.  I moved here from the states and just never really felt or believed patriotism there.  It's all ""We're #1"" just because we're America while all around me I saw anything but.  Bush ran the place for 8 years, went to war, and just did worse and worse as a country.  Canada doesn't have that.  They don't say their number #1, and when they do it's because they earned it.  Take the Olympics.  They didn't go in their assuming they'd win at everything.  They knew they'd been lagging behind in previous ones and invested millions of dollars to train athletes and ""own the podium"" and were one of the most dominant countries at the Olympics.  Even being outside Canada at that point it was amazing to watch.

OK well when the sun came up the next morning and Canada awoke

Well I had to jet.  I went back home, we're fucking going!  About a month later we hoped in the car and drove up into Quebec, which took us about 3 days to get there.  I fucking loved Quebec.  I listened to French songs and walked around Quebec city and felt like this was a place I wanted to be.  I caught a cirque de sole show and couldn't believe the enthusiasm those guys had for the city and the enthusiasm the crowd had for them. I drove on throuhg Quebec, into New Brunswick, Nova Scotia.  I rode a horse in Nova Scotia, this little tiny town.  I galloped, for the first time!  It was amazing!  I got a coin with a tiny little red maple leaf in the middle and thought it was so cool and kept freaking out making sure I hadn't lost it.  In Nove Scotia I came across a guy in a tiny little town dressed in raggy clothes who owned this almost dilapitated gas station who was telling us about the Shriners and how everyone should donate to them.  On the end of the Cabot Trail I found a place called Joe's Scarecrow Village in which somebody had gone ot the trouble to erect scarecrows on a plot outside a trailer, nametags

I didn't want to leave Canada.  I loved every minute.  I don't even know what it was I loved so much.  

So i came back home.  And now I miss it.  Next summer I want to go back.  I have plans to drive up to Alaska and just enjoy my time in B.C.  That place just had a beauty of its own.  I would love to see whats in the middle, as you would anywhere, but generally I found Canadians relaxed and understanding.  People didn't tend to yell, or get edgy, instead just spoke in a calm voice, and were very helpful.  One guy gave me his parking pass out of the blue because I didn't have any money.   I loved listening to the radio.  There was a radio drama playing all through New Brunswick about some soldiers, ""Afghanida"" or something.  A radio drama.  Really?  Fuck!  That is cool!

I just wanted to say I guess, relaxing, and nice place to be.  In the states, people often act like I don't belong here because I'm a Muslim girl, even thouhg I'm born and raised here.  In Canada I felt more accepted and I had only been there a few weeks.  Do I think it's perfect, nah, no place is!  It's just... you guys, is special,,
