Hey Guys

After seeing a lot of questions about Glock 19 v Glock 23

This table lists part numbers for the 19 and 23

Of note:
Gen3 19s and 23s shared the same recoil springs. Not the case for Gen4. 

There is a different trigger mechanism housing for each of the 4 models. This is due to the different ejectors. 

Firing pins between 9 and 40 are different. This is rarely mentioned. 


I'm happy to do another comparison for other models. Just ask. Whichever is most requested is the one I'll do. ",self,t5_2v6xn,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glocks/comments/1i42ba/a_guide_to_glock_19_vs_glock_23/

Sorry if this is a little rant-y; I am really not trying to offend anyone - just disseminate some information.

*Basics*

Gaston Glock is a senior plastics engineer

1) Many things do double duty - For example

2) The gun is not, for example, are designed to make it as likely as possible that the gun will go into battery. They are not supertight for target shooting, and the geometry of the recoil is not designed to be gentle on the finish of the barrel. They will get scratched up, and that is fine.

Another great example is the Glock 'pig nose'. For those unfamiliar, and can be ignored. The area is little more than a dust cover, and should actually be flexible during firing. This caused some early problems with rail mounted lights preventing .40S&amp;W from cycling properly. This is resolved, and not an issue. Achieving operating temperatures that can permanently damage the gun are exceedingly unlikely, unless you're really, really trying.

3) The trigger is intentional - The Glock was designed for the Austrian Army. Many military rifles have staged triggers

4) The plastic guide rod is fine - The guide rod being plastic is completely irrelevant. If you can put it together without the guide rod, inspect it on a regular basis, *like you should everything else on your gun*.

*Recommendations for maintaining a Glock as a reliable combat handgun*

1) Don't add stuff your Glock doesn't need. This includes:

- Grip plugs
- Custom whatever

2) Don't replace factory Glock parts with 3rd party parts that have infinitely less verified service ability. This includes:

- 3rd party trigger assemblies
- 3rd party connectors
- 3rd party guide rods.
- Esoteric caliber change configurations
- Third party barrels that advertise ""tighter lockup"" and ""greater accuracy"".

3) Keep your gun lightly lubricated. The design tolerances are loose on purpose

4) DO keep your gun clean

5) DO NOT feed it a regular diet of things like 9mm +P+. The majority of +P+ ammunition is actually detrimental to ballistics because the bullet was usually not designed to accommodate those velocities. It would also be unfortunate to suffer a recoil spring failure when you're staring death in the face. Instead of worrying about the last couple of ft-lbs of energy you can possibly squeeze out of your gun, will do far more for your survival than anything else.

6) DO disassemble and clean your magazines periodically. I run mine 99% dry

7) Do carry a spare magazine. The two most common points of failure on any semi-automatic handgun are the magazine and the ammunition.

8) Check your recoil spring on a regular basis. If the slide can lock back into battery unassisted when you point the gun upwards and depress the slide a quarter of an inch or so

9) If you're FTFing or FTEing, or 2) shooting bad ammo.

10) The gold grease looking stuff in your new Glock is factory copper grease. Glock recommends that you keep it on for the first few hundred rounds. It's presence ensures that any accidental machining burrs are smoothed out, but be aware of what it's function is.",,False,self,t5_2v6xn,1371131441.0,,

I own a Glock 19 Gen4 and three 10 round magazines. Everything is factory stock

However, I cycled the last round out, put it back in the magazine, and hit the slide release. Bam. Another FTF. This really bothered me because I had already had my serving of Glock Perfection Koolaid. So I tried putting one round of Federal Champion in the magazine, and hitting the slide release. The round chambered just fine. I tried it this again with one round of my buddy's reloads (plated round nose, same length as Federal Champion), and ANOTHER failure to feed when hitting the slide release. All of these FTFs were of the same nature; the round never made it to the feed ramp. Instead the bullet goes straight into the bottom of the feed ramp lip

So after closer inspection, there was enough of a hard jacket to deflect off the lip and chamber itself. The plated lead being softer, it got caught on the feed ramp lip. The hollowpoint, not having a cone shaped nose, also got caught on the feed ramp. 

So why was this happening?

After closer inspection of the magazine follower, so as it is feeding out of the magazine, it takes a slight nose dive, causing it to hit the bottom lip of the ramp and jamming there.

Further research online shows that this is a proven problem, the barrel and therefore feed ramp may be at a slightly different angle, so even if the last round dips, it feeds fine.

Here's a link to some different followers from Glock

http://imgur.com/LKaMR

Please check your magazines and make sure they feed the last round of whatever ammo you are carrying. 

I'm sure Glock knows about this

UPDATE: Calling glock is faster than emailing. I called

The basic idea behind the competition is pretty simple: starting now, the user who has received the most karma for a submitted picture of his/her Glock will be declared the victor and will receive a brand new, official [Glock Armorers Tool](http://www.glockmeister.com/GLOCK-Armorers-Disassembly-Tool/productinfo/G3374).

The guidelines: 

- The picture **MUST** contain your Reddit username in some way. You could write it on a card and put it in the foreground, or stencil it on your slide, or whatever, as long as the image clearly shows that this a picture of your Glock, taken by you, for the purposes of posting on Reddit. **EDIT**: There seems to be some confusion about this rule, so I will do my best to explain it better: I want you to take a *new* picture of your Glock(s) with your username physically *written* somewhere in the shot. You could even load up /r/Glocks on an iPad and use that as a background

- You may submit and delete/repost as many times as you would like

- You may name your submission however you like; you need not specify that the image you are posting is for the giveaway. I will just assume that any picture submitted that follows the guidelines was intended to be recognized as part of the competition. 

- I recommend being creative with your image. While it is perfectly acceptable for you to submit a blurry cell-phone picture of your Glock 17 on a picnic table, Generation 2.5 or C RTF2, I would suggest using that as your submission.

1363972111.0,1at49c,Do you have what it takes to be a CERTIFIED GLOCK ARMORER?,FirearmConcierge,54,19,27,"I've been asked this question a few times this week regarding access to factory classes and instruction so I figured I should do post something useful in light of all the butthurt I have been causing. Yes

FYI: I did my armorers class THREE YEARS AGO. I am due for re-certification in the last quarter of this year. The info that I have may be outdated but for the most part it stays the same. 

**HOW TO GET INTO THE CLASS:**

Simple. Be law enforcement, or a GSSF member. For most of you - the GSSF membership will be the path of least resistance. 

**WHAT TO EXPECT:**

It's boring. Glocks are very simple to understand and operate and if you can put an iphone 4 in an otterbox, parts, history of the pistol, differences in model, breaking down the gun etc - you break for lunch - then you break down the guns again, do some review, the instructor tells you what material you need to know for the test. The test is closed book. You do not get notes or your armorers manual. If you pay attention

**WHAT SHOULD I BRING FOR LUNCH?**

I would ask Glock who is doing the catering. Get some solid intel because I had a questionable sammich with less than stellar gastrointestinal results. I would pack an emergency lunch in case the food they serve does not agree with you. Yes

**WHAT SWAG DO I GET FROM THIS WONDERFUL MECCA OF FIREARM INSTRUCTION?**

Prepare to be disappointed. You get an armorers tool (NOTE: The factory armorers tool is useful but get a 3/32 punch from Sears. It's cheaper, and a GLOCK PERFECTION pen. Note that my pen did not work, so there was nothing perfect about it. They teach you how the guns run and you take a test. As my mother would say - you go to class to learn, not to make friends or have fun. 

I am told that you may be able to get a discounted gun but when I went through it - there was no written policy or anything about it. Your miles may vary but many manufacturers have killed discount programs to catch up on orders.

You get an orange slide cover plate that lets you check the engagement of the trigger bar cruciform and the striker because it is half the size of the normal plate. You'll use it once in a while to check the parts in question to see if they are out of spec

Hats are available for purchase as are DVD's with a power point presentation of slides and mechanics of operation. I bought the DVD

**HOW DO I FIND A CLASS NEAR ME?**

This is the Glock training schedule - https://www.glocktraining.com//Schedule.aspx

It SUCKS and is a pain to navigate. The only way you can sort the information is by date or by state. 

AC is standard armorers class, IW is instructor workshop open to current armorers who have instructor creds through state or NRA and G18 is their Glock 18 course open only to those who own an 18. **MAKE SURE YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE PROPER CLASS.** 

You'll note the following. There is ALWAYS a host - it can be an LE agency

There are so many that many can be found inside of a 1 hour drive, you miss the class. There is zero chance of you being able to fly in day of unless you are on a red eye from the west coast and getting in at 6:15AM. Not that you're going to fly cross country on a mileage run just to keep your Delta Diamond Medallion status like my brother....

I digress. Back to the Glock training schedule....

**HOW TO GET INTO THE CLASS ROUND 2**

After taking into account the date, host - you have one other factor working against you. 

**CLASSES MAY BE CLOSED TO YOU IF YOU ARE NOT IN LAW ENFORCEMENT.** You may find the perfect class 20 minutes from your house on your day off and it is LE only. That sucks. **BUT WAIT! THERE'S HOPE!**

There's a few ""status"" modes for classes. Cancelled/Closed/Full/Restricted are self explanatory. 

**YOU WANT TO LOOK AT TWO THINGS: TIME TO CLASS AND EMPTY SEATS.**

This is important for a few reasons. Look at the classes offered in the next 5 days. A lot of them are closed/cancelled or full. You have to plan ahead. But you can't plan too far ahead. You're probably wondering why you don't want to be booking a class in July in March because you have to plan the fuck ahead

Part of planning ahead is planning to procrastinate. 

**GLOCK WILL CANCEL THE CLASS IF CERTAIN CRITERIA ARE NOT MET. THEY REQUIRE 20 OR MORE TO DO THE CLASS. IF THEY ONLY HAVE 19

The criteria for a Glock class is: **They need 20 or more students.**

Max class size is 35

The rule is no more than 15 open seats. 

If they do not get their 20 students or have more than 15 empty seats, you can be pretty certain that class is a go. If there's 7 weeks to go and there's 32 empty slots - you can be pretty sure that's going to get the ax....

Which leads me to my next point.

**LE ONLY CLASSES ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE AT LEAST 15 REGISTRATIONS 6 WEEKS BEFORE CLASS DATE - IF 15 ARE NOT MET

So, they will open to all categories and try to meet the minimum. Yes, it is a pain in the ass to watch this like a pot of boiling water but if the only class near you is LE only you have no choice.

**SO I HAVE PASSED THE ARMORERS CLASS WHAT CAN I DO WITH IT?**

Jack and shit

You are officially certified to fix an item that is branded as

You can order parts from the factory - but you can't just call Glock and order them. You have to have an order form emailed

Prepare to argue about glock technical speak on the internet as you frame and hang your xerox quality certificate on the wall next to your kindergarten diploma on your ego wall.

_________________________________________________

Dear Friend
 
First of all
 
I just returned from the 2013 SHOT Show in Las Vegas
 
1)      Glock is back ordered 600

2)      AR magazines are back ordered over 2 million units from all manufactures

3)      Distributors are 2-3 weeks behind in shipping orders when their normal turn around time was 1-2 days
 
With that being said
 
Most other items are available, Glock logo items and apparel, custom performance parts, etc...it is just taking us a bit longer than normal to process and ship these orders.
 
We ship orders in the order in which they were received. If you have placed an order for magazines…please be patient. Your credit card will not be charged until your order is ready to ship. I suggest you stay on our list and we will ship your order as soon as possible. 
 
Please do not call or email for a status update – especially if you ordered magazines - we want to ship your order and are doing everything we can to acquire these items and ship as soon as possible. Our phones are extremely busy and even with 45 people working here we are unable to answer every call or even answer every email in a timely manner.
 
I do apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. We are currently hiring and training people to help us manage this huge influx of business.
 
I sincerely appreciate your trust and faith in our business. We value you as a customer and friend.
 
Thank you

Any who, I want a single action trigger. So I picked up a CZ P07. It was great! Very accurate and comfortable. But there's 0 aftermarket support, and I should really get something more reliable to carry. I know! I should get a Glock 19. But no, it's ugly and everyone has one. So I picked up an M&amp;P. Gorgeous! Comfy! Can't hit jack with it! I know!! I'll get a Glock 19. But maybe I just suck with striker fired guns, and need a single action to be a decent shot. Here, I almost buy a 1911. 

BUT I resisted the urge to be different, I can shoot the staples out of the paper at 7 yards now. Why does anyone else try to make guns anymore? I understand the fanboyism now. I am a convert. I'm sorry I ever doubted you.",,False,self,t5_2v6xn,False,,

The one holster that people seem to love is the Crossbreed Supertucks but I haven't seen one other than in a video or 2. On the other hand I believe there is a local shop not too far away that forms their own kydex so I've also considered running to the leather shop and getting the formed kydex and creating my own.

If it helps

Any opinion are welcome.

 This post is designed to answer the most common questions about the different GLOCK training model pistols. The pistols below are mine. There are different variations and generations

 _____________**The Glock 17 T**_____________

 We will start with the “T” models. The most common is the G17T. The G17T comes in two calibers; the 9mmFX (more commonly known as “simunitions”) and the 7.8x21AC. The 9mmFX is a center fire cartridge and is the most common of the G17T. The 7.8x21AC is an air compressed cartridge. GLOCK says it exists, so other “T” models may exist. 


 The “T” models are considered real firearms, state and local laws apply. They are legal to own (depending on your jurisdiction), but are available from GLOCK to LE only. They do pop up for sale from time to time in various places.


 This is the G17T. Obviously

 This is the left side of the slide

http://i.imgur.com/GafdUPG.jpg

 This is the right side of the slide

http://i.imgur.com/urmcrJZ.jpg

 All of the “T” models get a serial prefix of “T” followed by numbers. The “T” prefix is reserved for “T” models only and is not found on any other model.

http://i.imgur.com/C6NuqcR.jpg

 Interestingly

http://i.imgur.com/vy4A0IW.jpg

 This is the muzzle of the 9mmFX barrel. You can see how it is offset to the top. 

http://i.imgur.com/tLNc5Cw.jpg

 The G17T uses a regular 9mm magazine

http://i.imgur.com/a41aRKH.jpg

 The G17T does have it’s own recoil spring assembly and part number.

http://i.imgur.com/AP2bukx.jpg

 The G17T barrel has a much longer feed ramp and is rifled.

http://i.imgur.com/dHRRLBO.jpg

 The G17T firing pin tip is offset to the bottom.

http://i.imgur.com/UQxJtNz.jpg

 The G17T has a unique locking block.

http://i.imgur.com/2KjpQVj.jpg

 Here is the locking block

http://i.imgur.com/XckX7UH.jpg

 Aside from these noted differences

 _____________**The Glock 22 P**_____________

 Next are the “P” models. The most common is the G22P. The G22P is of course chambered in .40 S&amp;W. I do know that there are other “P” models


 The “P” models are considered real firearms, state and local laws apply. They are legal to own (depending on your jurisdiction), but are available from GLOCK to LE only. They do pop up for sale from time to time in various places.


 This is the G22P. Obviously

http://i.imgur.com/8o42yEf.jpg

 This is the left side of the slide

http://i.imgur.com/OBLStRS.jpg

 The G22P has a serial prefix of “PJ..” Only the “P” and “R” (explained later) have the “PJ” prefix.

http://i.imgur.com/qIWSRoK.jpg

 This is the muzzle of the G22P

http://i.imgur.com/tiglmS6.jpg

 Though the barrel is solid on a G22P, this hole will help disperse the pressure, presumably.

http://i.imgur.com/SVnhjTF.jpg

 Here is the side of the barrel. As you can see

http://i.imgur.com/J5o2fn7.jpg

 The G22P uses a normal G22 magazine. It does normally come with a black magazine baseplate. I added the orange for distinction.

http://i.imgur.com/jgFjWXR.jpg

 The G22P firing pin has no point.

http://i.imgur.com/ydFPwEH.jpg

 The G22P breech face has no hole for the firing pin to protrude.

http://i.imgur.com/L7ZmMXn.jpg

 _____________**The Glock 17 R**_____________

 Next are the “R” models. The most common is the G17R. I don’t know if there are any other “R” models other than the G17R. The G17R is chambered in 9x19. This pistol is designed so that the trigger resets after each pull


 The “R” models are considered real firearms, state and local laws apply. They are legal to own (depending on your jurisdiction), but are available from GLOCK to LE only. They do pop up for sale from time to time in various places.


 This is the G17R. Obviously

http://i.imgur.com/d5bU68I.jpg

 This is the right side of the slide with the warning that the firearm is a practice sample.

http://i.imgur.com/FktklyV.jpg

 This is the G17R serial prefix of “PJ.” Only the “R” and “P” models will have a “PJ” prefix.

http://i.imgur.com/v7sKGII.jpg

 The G17R uses regular G17 magazines

http://i.imgur.com/zwtT5IX.jpg

 The G17R has a regular

http://i.imgur.com/8MBSit4.jpg

 The G17R firing pin has no point.

http://i.imgur.com/hXW6MrQ.jpg

 The G17R firing pin (top) is much longer than a standard firing pin (bottom).

http://i.imgur.com/qnxDVqK.jpg

 The G17R breech face has no hole for the firing pin to protrude.

http://i.imgur.com/GFGN10P.jpg

 The G17R has a unique trigger spring.

http://i.imgur.com/Nz7mwtI.jpg

 _____________**The Glock Cutaway Models**_____________

 As for the last training model that GLOCK makes, depending on GLOCK’s mood.


 The cutaway models are considered real firearms, state and local laws apply. They are legal to own (depending on your jurisdiction), but are available from GLOCK to LE and armorers only. They do pop up for sale from time to time in various places.


 This is my very early cutaway G19. Someone foolishly decided to poorly polish it. I keep meaning to have it re-coated, what better model than a cutaway to prove the toughness of GLOCK’s metal treatment? 


 This is the G19 cutaway.

 This is the left side of the slide

http://i.imgur.com/ySR9YaH.jpg

 This is the right side of the slide

http://i.imgur.com/J4uWVdM.jpg

 Only the cutaway samples get a “JQ” serial prefix.

 Here is a general pic of the left side of the gun.

 The cutaway firing pins have no point.

Shot several hundred rounds of Winchester White Box and a couple (20ish total) of different JHP rounds yesterday. One of the most enjoyable range trips I've had. G19 functioned beautifully

I decided to clean it right when I got home. Unfortunately, trying to remove the CLP. I also field-stripped it again this morning and wiped it down. I'm pretty sure it got on the breech face and in and around the firing channel. Like I said, I'm a moron. Dumb, stupid beginner's mistake.

I know that excessive lubrication and oil can cause grime to collect in those areas

Should I worry? Or am I over-thinking things? Or should I just forget about it and go back to the range this weekend and send a few hundred more rounds downrange?

I'm also too much of beginner to risk disassembling the slide itself to try to get all of the CLP out. That said

I haven't shot it yet (been incredibly busy)

I have some questions though. I'm confused as to what generation this is

I first noticed that the mag was stamped with the .357 designator the day after I got the gun. I think the seller had a G32 (or is it G33?) for sale as well

Now before I actually try this

As for the generation

Gen3 features are as follows:

* Small mag release

* Gen4 not stamped on slide

* Mag release appears to not be ambidextrous

* Back strap on grip is NOT interchangeable 

Gen 4 features:

* Double spring on guide rod

* Large hole on front of slide

* Wider U shape on front of slide

I called Glock and spoke to a woman who asked for the serial (they all match up). She said that it was manufactured in July 2009 and was a Gen4. I'm not convinced. I say Gen3.

My Glock performed very well. The trigger seemed to smooth out just a little bit as I noticed the point at which the gun goes off changed after the first day. I used to take the slack to ""the wall"" and then press a short distance after that and the gun would fire. Now I notice that short distance has gotten closer to where the slack ends and as a result the gun is much easier to shoot. I don't think it's a result of refinement of my trigger control as mechanically it definitely feels different.

Ammunition I ran was Black Hills Ammo 115gr factory remanufactured.

The only real hiccups I had were that sometimes the slide wasn't locking to the rear after the last round was fired. The cause wasn't the Glock or the magazine

If anyone is looking to take classes like these I can wholeheartedly reccomend Costa Ludus. If anyone has questions on the training or prepping for it feel free to ask.

A few weeks back I purchased a stainless steel guide rod and a [GHOST](http://i.imgur.com/yeV8u.jpg) 3.5LB trigger connector for my Glock 17 off of Amazon. Prior to installing these 2 pieces

Yesterday afternoon I went out to the desert to test fire my pistol and the very first time I squeezed the trigger 3 rounds popped off. I thought WTF? Dropped the mag, installed magazine and continued to fire. I got bursts almost every time I pulled the trigger in the 2-4 bullet range. I shot 1 - 10 round magazine. Then I loaded 8 bullets into a 17 round mag and the same problem happened so I ceased fire, not wanting to break any components in my firearm or harm myself.


Could the trigger connector be the problem here? I did not have a chance to put the stock one back in and try it because all that stuff was at home and it was getting dark. Tonight I will clean the whole gun

I was shooting Winchester white box 115 grain 9mm FMJ.

The round count for her sits at 1720 rounds of nothing but Russia's finest offerings. I mean not one round of brass case has been through it since I have owned it, various springs, and buffing of things then I can recall and she did all this without complaint.

UPDATE: I went to the range today and put about 250 rounds downrange.  I noticed that when I really focus on my stance, I started to get more fatigued with my grip and noticed more and more ejection issues, almost 1 or 2 per 10 rounds.  I guess this goes to show that it was really me, and not my ammo or gun that has been causing this issue.

I'm getting ready to purchase my first Glock and just wanted to get the community's opinion on my decision. First of all, so I get better at shooting, when and if I do go to an academy. Seeing as how Glock 17's/22's are standard issue, I'm going with the safe route. However, because of the cost of ammo, I wanted to get the Glock 17.

Apparently I've chosen to buy a gun at the wrong time because all stores seem to be sold out on Glock 17s and I'd prefer to buy my gun in person. My dilemma is if I should buy a Glock 22 and buy a conversion (like the lone wolf conversion to 9mm) so that I could shoot with cheaper ammo. Has anyone encountered risks to using an aftermarket conversion? Will this in anyway put my investment at risk if I were to do this?

- Aside from night sights and extended slide release

- What sort of ""accessories"" do you suggest or recommend? I was thinking of possibly getting a light at some point down the line
- What about ammo for home defense?

I came across a posting for a Gen 3 with 4mags one being a fun stick for $425.00 so i emailed the guy my info. About an hour later i get a call from a guy who sounded 16. I could care less as long as everything checks out and he isn't actually 16. So we start the deal process I'm asking questions and the whole 9 yards. Everything sounds good so i want to meet up and possibly buy the gun. Towards the end of the conversation he starts to tell me he now wants $500 and i naturally ask why. Turns out this fool listened to his buddy and proceeded to ruin the thing by doing a ""custom stippling job"" in hopes of getting more for it. I go on to tell him he ruined the gun and would be lucky to get $375 - $400. He insists that it looks great and provides a awesome grip surface. I pretty much said what most of us would of about how it was a bad idea and there are grips to help if needed plus he should of kept it factory since he.was selling it. Now here is where it gets kinda funny but also kinda sad. The guy must have been 16 because the thing out of his mouth was how it's the highest quality plastic gun made in Germany and that glocks are made with such advanced plastics that they can pass through a metal detector with out setting it off. I almost lost it and before I hung up I said to check a globe because he has his countries messed up and WTF does he think the barrel and slide are made of.... I never thought I would come across someone that stupid and sure in hell not someone with a firearm. Now that i think back the kid must have been underage and the gun was probably stolen. The only reason i say it was possibly stolen was the area he wanted to meet up was in the ghetto and i dont think a actual firearm owner could be so stupid when it comes to info about their weapon plus he fucking stippled the thing....

Anyways I thought the whole ordeal was kinda fucked up so I thought I would share. Anyone have any similar stories?

EDIT: The kid finally got back with me and said he sold it for $460.00. I'm not sure if someone actually paid that much for a ruined Glock or he's lying to try and make me feel bad/stupid.

The photo looks pretty nice, except minor wear near the muzzle, probably from holstering.  It has night sights, but I would imagine they aren't very bright anymore, due to age.

The Glock smile started to show at about 1200 rounds.  I didn’t think this was supposed to happen on the Gen 4 barrels but it’s beginning on mine.  Also underneath the barrel is definite wear from the recoil spring, I haven’t seen this on my friends gen 3 guns so it was unexpected.  Wear is also showing on the slide lock and guide rails on the frame however it is minimal on the rails.

Normally with dry fire you have to manually cycle the slide which forces you to break your grip every shot you dry fire. This trainer actually incorporates a laser into the dry fire training and does not require you to manually cycle the slide in order to get a good reset and follow through on the trigger. For any folks like me in a colder state sometimes winter gets in the way of training so you end up dry firing. For me this is not a good option just yet as the G17/22 is a bit large for me so I run the G19.

Yes

I own a few handguns.  No glocks.  Want to get a 29.  Thinking gen4 because that new recoil setup can't be bad...that's about it

I am looking for guidance regarding a few general glock questions:

* Is it realistic to say I will never ever clean my glock (figure 1000rds a year) and expect it to always function?

* Will occasional salt water damage a glock? Are the metal parts resistant to salt? Anyone know of an aftermarket coating that they would trust their life on?

* I have heard of modifications for the trigger pull weight - are they going to effect reliability? I would like to knock the 5.5# down a little if possible.

* I understand cast boolits are not recommended for the polygonally-rifled glock barrels

* I want to go with night sights or a fiber front sight or something like that; for the 29 it seems that's aftermarket only.  Could anyone offer guidance or is anyone here a dealer that wants to quote a price for options?

Does anyone have feedback on the 29SF vs 29gen4 that they would like to share? A few mm's here and there don't sound like a lot

Can anyone recommend a holster that would work for concealment and allow for a light? Assuming not

I suppose that's really it.  I thank you all for any feedback, or the like.

1358195027.0,16kjhe,Just read Glock: The Rise of America's Gun. Way better read than I had expected. Favorite highlights inside. cr from r/guns,Mr_Budha,14,5,10,"So I just finished reading Glock: Rise of America’s Gun by Paul M. Barret and I thought I would share some of my highlights with you all. First off if you enjoy history and you love firearms this is a must read. I was truly surprised by what a great read this book was. It is chalked full of useful information and much of the politics

“In 1983

    It was interesting to read about how Glock beat out over all the established companies such as Beretta and Sig for the Austrian contract. Especially since Gaston Glock was literally some random Austrian Engineer who just decided to build a pistol for the govt.

“No other country finds so much history, vice, and virtue in so many guns.”

    Henry Allen talking about guns in American culture.

“In many ways

“ I will never forget how it felt to hold a loaded gun for the first time and lift it and fire it, it is an investiture, like knighthood, and even though you didn’t invent it or design it or tool it the credit is yours because it is in your hand, you don’t even have to know how it works, the credit is all yours, with the slightest squeeze of your finger a hole appears in a piece of paper sixty feet away, how can you not love this coiled and sprung causation, they move

“The agency was beginning to recruit female personnel, shorter cartridge of the same bore diameter, which could be fired from a slightly altered version of the nine-millimeter pistol. To distinguish the new product, and give the FBI its own distinctive load, the manufacturers called the ammunition the .40 S&amp;W.”

    On how and why the .40 caliber was designed. Which by the way Glock beat S&amp;W to the market on a gun that shot .40. That’s right

“The purpose of the assault weapons ban was to reduce the number of these guns (and large magazines) on the street

    On how the weapons ban of 94 only led to gun companies making more money and selling more guns and magazines.

“In Austria, and other traditional Austrian fan fare. And Glock thanks attendees in the style of a country baron blessing his peasants.”

    As the book continues you begin to see how the transformation that Gaston Glock went through (for good and bad). From an unassertive Austrian Engineer to a industry titan who very much loved himself.

“No brand of modern firearms commands greater loyalty than Glock. “Glockmeisters” see themselves as rugged, lethally effective – like the gun they love.”

“Glock

    The author took this right off of glocktalk.com and mentions the website by name.

“I agree with most of what the NRA wants to do, because paranoia makes gun owners get out the checkbook.”

    I am an NRA member but I do agree with much of this statement.

“The firearms industry is a family, heaped honors on Scott, letting it be known that Smith &amp; Wesson was absolved of its sins. Gun shops began selling the company’s products again. The yearlong boycott ended.

    On S&amp;W renouncing the pact with the Clinton Administration that had caused a boycott on S&amp;W products. Americans felt as though the company had sold out to the govt.

“Apart from keeping a lot of lawyers busy

    Let’s hope we have the same outcome this year.

“After the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, national guardsmen, and soldiers.”

    Many of these pistols are unaccounted for as there was no record keeping and many of the recipients sold them.

“Instead, and vile child pornography. Barring repeal of the Second Amendment and a profound shift in the collective psyche of a large portion of our population-neither likely-guns are her to stay.”

“Gun control advocates deplore Glock’s marketing strategy. “The rise of handguns in dominance in the marketplace has corresponded with an increase in their efficiency as killing machines

“Sarah Palin got at least one important point right at the 2010 NRA convention: The total number of guns in private hands in the United States is at an all-time high, to their discredit, tend to paper over this good, if difficult-to-explain, news. It makes their fund raising and lobbying more challenging. Indeed, falling crime rates help explain why these advocates have failed to enact any meaningful new federal gun-control legislation since 1994.”

“Few of the Americans who as company employees helped make Glock what it is today have shared I its success or wealth”

    After reading this book

Do yourself a favor and read this book. It is about much more than just Glock. It covers the man, the politics, the culture changes, and many things far and between.

Has anyone on here ran a 'smooth' safety plunger with a 3.5lb connector and 6lb trigger spring? 

Has anyone moved from a similar setup to one of the full on trigger kits? (glockworx etc)


Thanks


EDIT: So far it seems like most people have a 3.5# connector and some sort of spring setup.  Doesn't seem like the money is worth a full trigger assembly compared to the connector and springs

**EDIT 2:**

My LGS had a zev/glockworks fulcrum kit instock for like 50% off so I picked it up.  Came with trigger bar, trigger spring, 2 firing pin springs, and a safety plunger with spring.  

I installed the trigger bar, and trigger spring into my gen4 (I kept my ejector housing).

I put my older 3.5# connector and trigger spring into my gen3 as well as a new larger slide stop.  

Thoughts: 
    
I installed the 3.5# connector and trigger spring into my gen3 first.  Then did all the zev parts into my gen4.  I've read that there are differences between the gen3 and gen4's when running a (-) connector and now have a direct comparison.  I don't have a trigger gauge but based on feel the **gen3 feels lighter with a (-) connector and trigger spring only vs a gen4 with the same (-)connector and trigger spring**  I've read that this is because of a slightly different angle in the gen4 ejector housing.  

Now with a direct gen3/gen4 exact parts swap done, when set up correctly it is pretty much an on/off trigger, very little to no pre-travel depending on how you set it up.  Now since I had all the springs etc, I tried each one individually. 

**With the trigger bar/trigger spring and (-)connector it felt a little heavier than the gen3

I've read about misfires with the competition firing pin spring so I'll hit up the range in a couple days to see how it runs as I might swap that back out.  The gen3 setup based on pull weight is very much what I was looking for in my gen4,False,self,t5_2v6xn,1356814306.0,,,t3_15f8ax

Most people get around that problem by putting Lone Wolf barrels like [this one](http://www.lonewolfdist.com/Detail.aspx?PROD=943&amp;CAT=238) in their Glock because they use standard rifling. But I've read numerous sources claiming that Lone Wolf barrels aren't as reliable as stock Glock barrels. 

Is that true? And does anyone have experience with shooting the specific ammo I linked through their 3rd Generation Glock 20? 

I've also read that a lot of people put beefed up springs and guide rods in their Glock 20s in order to improve performance. 

Is that really necessary when all I plan to rarely use my Glock 20 for is defense against bears and other dangerous animals out in the wild?

My mom's neighborhood has been in decline for the last 5 years

The question:

What ammo (and therefore caliber)?  I carry a G23 w/ Gold Dots, as I have a sister and two nieces that are in bedrooms opposite hers sometimes.  The internet says shot shells are no good on two legged beasts, but within the close range of her small home (1300sq ft/4bed/2bath), surely something acceptable can be found.  My fear is that she'd be too worried about her grand-babies too pull the trigger, and the whole situation goes to sh*t.  I want her to be confident that nothing lethal is going to make it through the wall.  If a suitable round can be found, I suppose a revolver in that caliber is what she needs.  Thoughts?
