1353350780.0,13gnjm,Providing tech support to telemarketers for fun and justice.,Psychotc,5201,1202,640,"Like most sane individuals

For the past few months I have been receiving calls from telemarketers asking if I want %voiceSpammer%'s services. The first few times I politely told them to respect the do not call list and do not call again. When they kept on ignoring that I figured it was time to use my VOIP support abilities for some fun.

So one evening, when I hear my phone politely inform me that there is a long distance call coming in. Looking at the caller ID, I see the number of someone who legally should not be calling me. Being slightly bored I answered and prepared to have some fun.
This telemarketing company gave away alot of information about it's system within the first few seconds of a call. By having 5 seconds of silence followed by the unmistakable default [asterisk](http://www.asterisk.org/) Conference join sound

Once I heard the conference connect beep I have to work quickly to set my trap

 
 
me: ""Tech support

Spammer: ""........ Um hello

me: ""I'm going to stop you there. Your system has detected that there is a issue with your workstation and has automatically sent you through to tech support. Can I have your agent ID please""

Confused spammer: ""Is this Mr Psychotc I'm speaking with""

Me: ""No, hoping that I'm close enough to completely lure the prey into the trap*

Sheep: ""Oh

Me: ""Ok

Sheep: ""Yes""

Me: "" Ok

Sheep on the ramp to the abattoir: ""Ok

Me: ""Ok, 8 and * at the same time, let me know when you are done

Sheep: ""Ok

Me: *hoping their voip admin left things at default* ""Ok

Mutton: *unjoin conference sound*
 
 

And it has been a few months since I last heard from them.

Some technical details for those who do not work with VOIP and polycom products. The sequence above is the reload firmware and reset to factory defaults hotkey and the default password to allow the reload. Most polycom phones take about 5-10 minutes to reload the firmware

But then there's that feeling you get in the pit of your stomach when you plug in the customer's PC and hear the ""click BANG"" or ""BOING whirllllll"" of a failed HDD while the BIOS reports no bootable drive.  You have to look them in the eye and tell them you are already 99% sure the drive is dead and there is nothing you can do about it.  You hand them the little card with the number to DriveSavers or similar professional data recovery and warn them it's going to cost a lot of money.  You are kind enough not to scold them about their lack of a backup
 
Flash back to 2007.  One morning I get to the shop to find a customer standing outside the front door with one of those ubiquitous claim-shell Dell PCs under an arm.  The look in his eyes alone tells me all I really need to know about the situation.  I tell him to come in and put the PC on the counter.  We exchange niceties as I plug in the monitor and keyboard and turn it on. 
 
We encounter the message he told me to expect
 
I tell him ""(Customer), etc.  This PC under his arm contains the entirety of their accounting everything.  Payroll, tax stuff, accounts receivable, everything.  He explains that they will go out of business if they can't get the data on that drive. 
 
I let him know that data recovery from a failed drive takes specialized skills and resources
 
Well
 
He's like: ""$2000 for data recovery?  And it might take weeks?  I don't know... Can't you do it?""  I tell him the truth:  If I try to recover his data and fail there is a huge chance I'll make it worse and less likely for a professional data recovery specialist to get it.  He really needs to go to the specialist.  Yet despite this
 
So I told him to give me his number and I'd do some research and get back to him.  I call in my fellow nerds and we research (our Google-Fu was strong that day).  We end up with a list of about 8 or so things to try to order them by risk.  We even manage to find two of the same model drives from the junkyard downstairs to look at.  By early afternoon I think we've learned what we can and I call the customer. 
 
I tell him I'll try it, something to protect us from the consequences of potentially (likely) destroying this data and the other PC drives as well. 
 
Guy shows up 15 minutes later with sweat on his brow and three more clam-shell Dells.  We're lucky, ziplock bags, and microfiber gloves from a photography shop.  I try to make arrangements with a buddy who works in a chip fabrication plant to use their clean room if needed.  That was impossible but he was able to get me a couple of those dust free bunny suits and face masks.  Unfortunately they were pink.  But this was war so I did not complain. 
 
The first thing I try is swapping the PCB between a good drive and the failed one.  The good drive works fine with the failed drive's PCB
 
I dawned the bunny suit, but I was concerned about adding that much CO2 into a small sealed room.  I made it a point to hold my breath if I was reaching down to the floor.  After the fog was gone I noticed no ill effects and proceeded to phase 3. 
 
The actual platter swap went without incident and hardly warrants description in this story.  Just a few screws and aluminum spacer rings.  I just tried to line up the two platters so they were aligned the same way relative to each other in the new case.  Obviously I could not get nearly the same level of precision at the physical scale of the data on the drive
 
We held our breath while we booted up the bench PC with a Linux data recovery live CD.  It found the drive!  I started to read an image from the drive,False,,t5_2sfg5,False,,,t3_trffn

Week 1 Saturday
**Tech 1**: &lt;Speech&gt;  
**Me**: &lt;Account Info&gt;  
**Tech 1**: How can I help you?  
**Me**: I have been having a very high ping to the internet after about 4pm till about 9pm everyday since I got your service installed. I have tried restarting the modem
**Tech 1**: Please restart your computer.  
**Me**: OK. But
**Tech 1**: I understand but we need to make sure that this doesn't fix it.  
**Me**: Well
**Tech 1**: Um
**Me**: With my router.  
**Tech 1**: Uh... A what?  
**Me**: A router.  
**Tech 1**: Sir
**Me**: Excuse me?  
  
10 more minutes goes by as I disconnect my router
  
**Tech 1**: It looks like we are going to have to send out somebody.  
**Me**: Thank You.  
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
Next Monday the tech arrives and we go down to the drop. I had not been present for the installation. The drop was in a locked basement inside of a locked cabinet, to figure out which line was mine through the process of disconnecting one connection at a time. Mine ended up being the forth split down. RJ6-&gt;6Way-&gt;4Way-&gt;3Way-&gt;3Way-&gt; Me, which I had split again with a 2Way. One for cable, one for internet.  
  
**Me**: Well
**OnSite Tech 1**: I dont know.  
**Me**: It works in the morning and late at night.  
**OnSite Tech 1**: It is probably because when people get home in the evening they turn on their tv/internet and you are getting interference.  
**Me**: So
  
The OnSite Tech closes and locks the cabinet.  
  
**OnSite Tech 1**: Nothing. It is a wiring issue on the premises. We are not responsible. Talk to your landlord.  
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
My landlord was more or less a slum lord (Oakland). The building was falling apart and was in serious need of repair. The landlord
  
Week 3
**Tech 2**: &lt;Intro&gt; What can I help you with?  
**Me**: I have had a very high ping to the outside world between the hours of 4pm till 9pm rendering my Internet unusable. I am interested in obtaining a partial refund for the time.  
**Tech 2**: I am sorry to hear that sir. Would you please reboot your computer?  
**Me**: This is not an issue with my computer. Comcast does not have a large enough drop for the apartment building I am in.  
**Tech 2**: I am sorry to hear that sir. We need to go through these basic troubleshooting steps to see if we can alleviate the issue.  
  
For the next twenty minutes I play repair man. Eventually the tech once again says the magic words.  
  
**Me**: Can I schedule the tech to come between 4pm and 9pm?  
**Tech 2**: Very well sir. You will have to wait until next Thursday if that is the time slot you want.  
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
Week 4
**OnSite Tech 2**: Lets go look at the box downstairs.  
After unlocking the basement and the cabinet he lets out a low whistle.  
**OnSite Tech 2**: Which one is yours?  
**Me**: This one.   
I point at the line that goes to my apartment.  
**OnSite Tech 2**: Alright
  
At this point the tech looks at me.  
  
**OnSite Tech 2**: I am not allowed to reorder these splitters because they are the owners property and other customers utilize these lines.  
  
And now I realize he is staring deep into my soul.  
  
**OnSite Tech 2**: The customers with these [things](http://www.cabletechtalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/trap_filter-300x182.jpg). Do not have internet and only subscribe to basic TV.  
  
Here he gestures to several of the lines. He lets his hand come to rest on a filtered line. I blink. It is connected directly to the first splitter.  
  
**OnSite Tech 2**: They require much less signal. It is going to take me 5 minutes with my 7/16 wrench and crimps to replace this tip. Then I will be on the pole for twenty minutes. Then I will come back to your apartment to check your signal again. I am sorry but I am **NOT** fixing this for you. I simply **can't**.  
  
I blink again. Twice actually. The tech turns his back on me and starts removing my line from the splitter to replace the tip. I back out the basement door and bolt upstairs. I pull out my wrench set and grab my 7/16. I run back downstairs just as the tech leaves the basement. He doesn't close the door. I wait until he walks out the front gate. Inside the basement I find the cabinet is closed but unlocked. Quick, true to his word, showed up at my door twenty five minutes after this all started. I had already reset my modem and had a 15ms ping to Google. Success. After testing, my line ran with acceptable numbers.  
  
**OnSite Tech 2**: I am glad that replacing the tip on your line improved the signal to such an extent. I am going to go lock up the cabinet now.  
  
  
And he was gone into the night. I really, anytime between roughly 4pm and 9pm I would have a ping of 200+ms to any server south of San Jose. This wouldn't normally be a problem for average web browsing, but I also happen to be a gamer. And for online gamers, latency can be the difference between life and death. How did I know that the problem was in San Jose? Traceroutes. Tons of them. Automatically generated every minute, every hour, every day. The issue appeared to be that the peering between Comcast and Level 3 in San Jose consisted of two 56k modems and smoke signals. Graphs of average latency times over the course of the day showed two bumps. A small one in the morning as people woke up for coffee and internet and a longer one in the evening when people got off of work and decided it was time for a good wanking. I decided to do comparisons with some friends from around the bay area. Apparently Comcast routed everything from the entire Bay Area through that L3 peering arrangement in San Jose. This was confirmed by OnSite Tech 2, the third time I met him.  
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
Week 7 Friday. 5pm. Cannot ~~play~~ ~~win~~ enjoy any matches due to higher than average pings. 30 Minutes of music.  
**Tech 3**: &lt;Intro&gt; How can I help you?  
**Me**: I have an issue where when I connect to some servers south of San Jose I get high pings and it is difficult to enjoy my games at those pings. It is only during high traffic times and I have the traceroutes that describe the issue.  
**Tech 3**: Will you please restart your computer.  
**Me**: Look
**Tech 3**: I am sorry sir
**Me**: I know. I have restarted my computer many times. Trust me. I have traceroutes that identify the issue.  
**Tech 3**: You have what?  
**Me**: Traceroutes.  
**Tech 3**: Uhh... I am going to elevate you to Tier 2.  
15 Minutes of music.  
**Tech 4**: &lt;intro&gt; How can I help you?  
**Me**: &lt;Explains the situation&gt;  
**Tech 4**: Can you please restart your computer.  
**Me**: No. Look. I have traceroutes that identify the issue. &lt;Explains about San Jose&gt;  
**Tech 4**: Sir
**Me**: Look
**Tech 4**: The what?  
**Me**: &lt;Growling&gt; Traceroutes. They show the path that your connection travels between your computer and the server you are attempting to reach.  
**Tech 4**: ... I am going to transfer you to another tech. Please hold.  
30 Seconds of music.  
**Tech 5**: &lt;Intro&gt; How can I help you?  
**Me**: I have traceroutes that identify a connection between the Comcast network and Level 3 in San Jose as the source of an exceptionally high ping that makes it difficult to play games online.  
**Tech 5**: Interesting... I am going to send a tech out to your location to see if it is in relation to your earlier support tickets.  
**Me**: ... I can plainly see that I get a sub 10ms ping to everywhere else in your network before the San Jose hop.  
**Tech 5**: How about Monday at 10am?  
**Me**: ... Really?  
**Tech 5**: Yes.  
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
Week 8
**OnSite Tech 2**: Let's go down and look at your line again.  
I am worried he is going to say something about the fact that I moved my line. He opens up the cabinet and smirks.  
**OnSite Tech 2**: I *forgot* which one was your line. Which one is it?  
I identify my moved line. He comments on the fact that it seems to be in an advantageous position and shouldn't be the issue. At this point he says he is going to go up on the pole and do some monitoring. For the next two hours his van sits outside the apartment complex. He comes back and informs me that he will be unable to fix the issue at this time because he cannot identify anything other than the fact that the lines in this area are old and need to be replaced. He said that might happen within the next two to ten years. As he leaves
**OnSite Tech 2**: Keep calling.  
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
For the next two weeks I call every other day and get the run around. They are refusing to offer to send a tech out because the last report identified no issues. I am not willing to pay the eighty dollars to have a tech come out if I request it. Every time they insist that the network is operating normally and does not have any issues. Finally in the middle of week 11 I get escalated and after what feels like the hundredth time they tell me everything is fine.  
**Me**: THE FUCK IT IS. I CAN PROVE IT ISN'T.  
**Tech #20 something**: I am going to transfer you.  
**Me**: To WHO? Nobody you transfer me to listens to what I have to say or understands what I am telling ...   &lt;Immediately music cuts me off&gt;  
15 minutes of music later Tech 5 answers the phone.  
**Tech 5**: &lt;Intro&gt; How can I help you?  
**Me**: &lt;I attempt to explain everything again&gt;  
**Tech 5**: We are going to send out the field tech again.  
**Me**: Again? This isn't going to fix it.  
**Tech 5**: I know.  
**Me**: What?  
**Tech 5**: After he is done
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
Week 12
**OnSite Tech 2**: Were oversold.  
**Me**: How much?  
**OnSite Tech 2**: All of it.  
**Me**: What?  
**OnSite Tech 2**: Bay Area. All of it. Six months until the money people will even talk about buying more bandwidth.  
**Me**: Six months?  
**OnSite Tech 2**: Yup.  
**Me**: Why
**OnSite Tech 2**: Most people never notice. Most people don't care.  
**Me**: What can I do about it?  
**OnSite Tech 2**: Keep calling.  
**Me**: Why?  
**OnSite Tech 2**: They only spend money to fix things if there are enough calls logged about an issue.  
  
  
The number Tech 5 gave to me turned out to be the number to his line. For the next two months I would call him every week and OnSite Tech 2 would come out and sit in his van for two to three hours. Then one day the call went a little differently.  
  
**Tech 5**: &lt;Intro&gt;. How may I help you.  
**Me**: I am still having the same problem with the high latency out of San Jose.  
**Tech 5**: I am **not** going to help you with this.  
**Me**: Excuse me?  
**Tech 5**: The network is *working* as it is *intended*.  
**Me**: Uh...  
**Tech 5**: We do not officially support 3rd party devices like your router. &lt;He has never brought this up before&gt;
**Me**: Um... Why not? &lt;Getting suspicious&gt;  
**Tech 5**: 3rd Party Devices like yours are able to change their mac addresses and we need to know that your mac address will not change to verify that you are the correct customer. &lt;This is obviously bullshit... but why?&gt;  
**Me**: I don't understand
**Tech 5**: I am **not** going to do anything to address this. The network is working as *intended*. &lt;Someone must be listening into the conversation.&gt;  
**Me**: Ok.  
**Tech 5**: Please call the help line at 1-800-###-#### if your issues persist. &lt;And the line goes dead. Not like he hung up
  
10 to 15 seconds later there is a dial-tone. I check my traceroute logs. Just about 30 minutes before my call I see that my connection is no longer being routed through San Jose. I have 10-30ms pings to every server I can try.  
  
  
tl;dr ISP's are corporations driven by greed but there are always technicians at these institutions who know what they are doing. They know the situation is fucked up. They know the ridiculousness of the problem. Sometimes a problem is a problem because of the poor ethics of the people in the suits. Sometimes good techs have to work at scummy corporations to feed their families&lt;I intentionally left this out for anonymity purposes&gt;.

Me: ""..."".

**Stealing our own equipment.**

We worked 2nd line helpdesk, one to remote take over the customer's system on, one to have our own systems on (this was standard on all help desks, even 1st line in our native country, but not where we were working now). We got brand new flatscreens to replace our CRT screens (in 2005!) with and started fighting about the graphics cards. BBBBB thought we could just open the computers and put in a new one (stationary ones, so it was easy). Asset management threatened that we would lose support. We said, hey, we can support our own computers. Asset management then said we would void any hardware warranty if we opened the computers. So that was that. Instead

After several months, it was used to replace old CRT screens at the sales department.

So

BBBBB: ""So when is my team getting their second screens.""

Manager: ""Well

BBBBB: ""So

Manager: ""It has worked fine for two months already

BBBBB: ""We have the budget for it.""

Manager: ""Well

BBBBB comes back, he chats up the girl in the reception and gets her to agree to call him before she calls asset management next time there's a delivery.

BBBBB: ""Come on you vikings. Time for pillage and plunder. Follow me!""

Me: ""What? What are we doing?""

BBBBB: ""You shame your forefathers - I would have said pillage and they would have had their axes out. We're stealing our second screens

Me: ""Very well.""

So, the manager comes running.

Manager: ""What are you doing!?""

BBBBB: ""Installing our second screen.""

Manager: ""You have not been assigned this equipment!""

BBBBB: ""Oh, so you can just order some more screens, right? No harm done.""

Fighting BBBBB over this, they were in operation and we had the budget was too much for management, so we got to keep the screens.

**Tolling

The country we were working in used the euro, and lots of people assembled large amounts of them. So, for fun and giggles, we started paying roadtolls to each other as we passed each others' desks. Basically just dumping whatever brownies you had at hand when you passed, to the curses of the one sitting there.

Then a poor guy went back home for an extended weekend

Then he got a really slow case - some of the users on his account wre local admins, he started sorting, piling and pyramiding the coins on his desk. After a while BBBBB passes by, sees on the screen that he is working, nods and keeps walking. After a short while, he returns and points to a small pyramid of coins.

BBBBB: ""That is one euro

Collegue: ""Yeah

BBBBB throws a 5-euro bill on the desks and proceeds to rake in five piles of coins with a devilish smile.

Collegue: ""Nice. But what are you doing with the coins?""

BBBBB: ""The girls at the cafeteria fucked with me yesterday. I'm going for a coffee.""

We also had a software distribution team that was over-staffed due to organisational changes. It also continued to work together with the team in the home country for several months, and there were 8 persons doing it. One of the guys at our place got bored, got a new job and gave his 4 week's notice. Since there were so little work, and the other 3 guys were not fully trained yet (as they got too little work to do to properly train), he and them agreed that he would not do any work for the 4 weeks' notice time. So he installed world of warcraft on his machine and sat there playing for 4 weeks.

After working hard setting up the Cub Scout summer camp I work at seasonally, like my ISP (who handles my landline) and bank and so on. So, I pick up my phone with an ounce of dread.

""Hello

(Thick Indian accent) ""Yes

""Yes

""This is... Jason... from Microsoft Support. We were doing a routine scan of networks in your area and noticed that your computer may be vulnerable to viruses and other malware.""

At this point, *that* Windows 2000) virtual machine for such an occasion.

""Oh

""Yes

""No

I set the phone down on my desk and stand up

""Okay

""Is your computer on?""

""I'm sorry?""

(Louder

""Oh

I set the phone down again and start rustling things around on my desk, before launching Virtualbox and starting up my 2k VM.

""Okay, it's gone away. Oh, wait, here's my computer now."" (Referring to my desktop.) ""Okay, it's all booted up. What now?""

There's a pause where I think ""Jason"" didn't realize he was still muted

""Jason? You there?""

""Yes, in the bottom-left, is there a key with a little flag on it?""

""...Keyboard?""

""Yes

""What's a keyboard?""

I can hear the facepalm. ""The device attached to your computer that you use to type

I start banging things around on my desk again. ""Sorry, I've uncovered the thing I type with... the keyboard?""

""Yes

""Okay. And I'm looking in the bottom-right for a key that looks like a cloverleaf?""

""...No

""A flag?""

""...Let's try this

""Yes

""Click on that

""Okay, I don't feel like typing it all out again) ""Set Program Access and Defaults, Windows Update, Programs, Docu--""

""It should be at the bottom

""The bottom?""

""Yes

""...Ohhhh! I see it now! Sorry I wasted your time. Okay. I clicked on that. What now?""

""A little box should pop up in the corner. In that box I need you to type in

""Okay

""No

""I hit Enter and it said 'Cannot find the file 'event' or any of its components...""

""I need you to go back to the Run box.""

""I'm sorry?""

Go to Start

""But I already did that.""

He sighs. ""Please

""Oh, I'm sorry. Okay, so I have the Run box up again."" (At this point my ignorant facade starts to slip.)

""You've typed in 'eventvwr' into the box?""

""Yes I have. e-v-e-n-t-v-w-r.""

""Good

""..Okay

""Yes, 'Security', and 'System'?""

""On the left? No... wait

""Okay

""Oh

""Those are warning messages about potential viruses from the Internet.""

""Oh

""Okay

At this point I'm cracking up. I've wasted almost ten minutes of this poor sap's time just trying to load Event Viewer, most computer users) into believing him.

""..Close out?""

""Click on the 'X' in the upper-right of the window.""

""I don't see an 'X'.""

""...Okay. Well. That's okay. Can you get the Run box up again?""

""How was that again?""

""Start

""Where's St-- oh, I've got the Run box up again.""

""Now I need you to delete everything in the box we typed in before

""Just

""No, and press the Backspace key.""

""The box closed.""

""You wh..."" I can hear the click as he mutes himself. There's a pause.

I'm losing him! I don't want him to hang up!

""Jason?""

""Yes

""Sure thing

""Okay. Now type in (Web address omitted). Can you repeat back to me what it says in the box?""

""Okay

""Yes

Jackpot. Executing a Web address in the Run box opens up an IE window (or whatever browser you have as default). I run a quick WHOIS on the site and

""Okay

""That's good

The Web interface for LogMeIn 123 loads up. Hooray! Time to screw with a remote user.

""Hang on a second, ""Kitty..."" I quietly return to my desk and start downloading as many pictures as I can from r/spacedicks, tossing them into a zip file on my desktop called ""passwords.zip"". I then go find a Flash drive I have lying around... it's covered in red electrical tape with the word ""VIRUS"" Sharpied on the side. It's a massive 7z archive of computer viruses, all ready to be unloaded onto a target system. I unpack it into the VM then re-zip it, fiddling around with the autoexec flags of some of the files. This is ""bank_data.zip"", naturally. It's ready.

""Okay

""Very good

""2-1-5-8-0-7. Is that right?""

""Yes. Now click 'Connect to technician' and we'll be connected to you

I click OK. It prompts me to allow access to LogMeIn's support software. I allow it

""Uh

""Yes

""Oh... okay.""

""Now

""Well

""You can walk away from the computer now

""Thank you

Naturally, the system's data is all incorrect). I get a call from Jason.

""Okay

""Thanks much

""I'm sorry?""

""Never mind. Goodbye!""

I'm still waiting on the follow-up. I promise I'll update this once it comes in.

For me, ask your customer if there is anything else you can do for her today!"" 

Barely time to react

After two tedious hours of this sea creature barely able to muster the muscles in her head to stop dribbling as she spoke

After taking note that HR Tank ""really needs a faster computer"" I take shelter in the canteen

I returned to find BHIT pacing around the room. His ruffled jacket and red face added to his now urgent stance; the few hairs that seemed strapped to the side of his head for once looking windswept despite their nominal length. He immediately pounced. ""Margie from legal affairs needs her machine back. Are you done with it?"" 

After racking my brains and my ticket list for several minutes

And so begins the epic hunt. We first visit the third line guys who profess innocence. Our next stop is facilities

A two hour whistle-stop tour of the building with MAFG in tow shows up nothing

On returning to BHIT, yet when it goes wrong it goes back to the nearest Support Monkey!

I took great pleasure on relaying the reaction of the facilities manager and also that each machine had been clearly labelled with a ticket number and name! 

After growing weary of Angie's bitchy comments

On our way to one network riser room, way to pour salt in the wound!

We had given up. In a purely flippant move, glaring disapprovingly at our failure, the ghost server standing as testament to their managerial apathy.

BHIT saw no alternative; he commanded that Margie's machine must be replaced by tomorrow morning

After clarifying a bend in the rules was OK ""just this one time""

8pm rolled around as the drone of people leaving and passing me by grew steadily to silence. I sat illuminated by a single monitor, etc. As I was the only soul left, the auto lights had dimmed most of the office, only to be activated in sequence by the cleaner, almost like a searchlight dancing on the stage, illuminating some actress performing against the backdrop of the hoover motor. 

After visiting Margie's desk and reconnecting her new PC

Feeling authoritative in myself, Outlook's ""new mail"" balloon popped up with it's accompanying self-important boink. Angie's name adorned the balloon like a warning label. I opened it, addressed directly to me, were the ominous words, ""We will discuss this tomorrow!""

1363798233.0,1ao78b,The B**** Manager from Hell Pt8: Best laid plans,jon6,5141,2787,283,"Monday morning finally arrived. I slightly congratulated myself that I managed to get through the entire weekend without wasting a single further thought on Angie. With no let-up in the weather

Surprisingly, Angie hadn't made it in. Myself and MAFG managed to pile through a bunch of tickets when Balding Head of IT came in. He asked me if I could attend a meeting later which I obliged. Fairly sure this was ""the meeting"", I began to mentally prepare my defense.

I was again pleasantly surprised that this meeting was not one in which my ass would be summarily served, replacing any laptop over 2 years old. BHIT made particular mention of a desktop rollout I performed last year - it was actually my initial 3 months contract, but as I'd proven myself worthy, was taken on full time. My job was to be responsible for managing the physical delivery of the new hardware/software as appropriate.

I set to work on the task with glee, although occasionally revealing some discrepancies, everything was up to date and reports were reliable.

After collating my results, QA'd and rope in some of my friendlier reps to pilot the new builds before the big day.

My analysis done and sent to BHIT

My smile was demolished Tuesday morning. Angie had made it in and was busy setting about the task of undoing anything that looked like progress. The instant I appeared

I say explanation, asking what I was doing taking apart a PC in the middle of the office? It seemed that some of the Fat Finance wenches had ratted me out as well and claimed I'd caused such a loud commotion, they were prevented from working! I wonder if it's the same finance hag that is in her coffee group? This dressing down seemed to last forever, and it did... this was a good 20 minuter! 

Dressing down fully received, where we should go if Angie is not around to give her approval to retrieve gear from the cupboard and, most importantly, where are we supposed to work on machines or hardware? These were things which worked perfectly fine a few weeks ago were now suddenly were not fine. 

The reply from BHIT was as usual fairly impotent and full of noncommittal statements. His response that he was unaware the IT Cupboard was being used as a build area for hardware came as a shock to us all particularly as he was the one who got the Ghost Server off the 3rd line team in the first place. He concluded by requesting that we should seek clarification of suitable build areas from our manager

The water deepened. I held my breath, which of course none of us could now access anymore. Added to that, with the conference project looming, exactly where were we meant to image these machines? And how would I be able to access our build server for the task at hand - my nightly WhatsAlive script reporting it as the only machine missing in action?

As a demonstration of the extent of his ineptitude, can you please direct Jon6 appropriately? Thanks.""

You can guess the next conversation. ""What conference is this and what makes you think you have anything to do with it?"" Angie demanded. As BHIT had truly dumped me in it, this was now something new she could micromanage to the nth degree, but not without a scolding first. She first demanded to know why she was never informed. 

I responded, this is why BHIT and several heads asked for me by name! That said, as it's a major project, I find it difficult to believe that you were not in the loop with this one already?"" (whoa... saucer of milk, meeting room 7... could it be score 1 to Jon6?)

In reality, I have no idea, only the future will tell. But I did know at that moment that this process won't go well. It will either be mired in micro-managementism... or I just won't do it at all.

So, I've made enough of an impression by some heads to have been asked for by name to drive this forward. On the other hand, I had the bitch manager from hell, bent on thrusting her dagger of incompetence into the beating heart of anything resembling efficiency.

And there was still no response about where hardware/builds should be taking place. 

One thing I was sure of... if we're going to play this game

Back story: A couple weeks ago I was contacted by a friend of an acquaintance of mine who runs a very small business and wants to set up a web site where potential clients can see services, etc. Now, I am a 4th year Mechatronic Eng student, so although web site design is not my forte - I do have a functional understanding of php/Javascript/html and it is semester break so I agree to set this up.

I go to meet her

Fast forward to last Friday. I'm all finished, loves it, its exactly what she wants. I give her my account number for her to transfer my payment, she thanks me and the call ends.

Now this morning (one week later) - payment is still not in so I send an email to see whats going on. The reply:

&gt;I have not yet transferred funds. And dont hold your breath. I signed no written agreement and you have no proof that I aggreed to provide payment. Let this be a lesson to you.

&gt; Thanks for the web site.

Really? Took me a couple minutes to process what I had just read. I should be mad - but I'm not. Armed with a cheeky grin

    scp -r /var/www hez@&lt;my servers ip&gt;:/home/hez/company_name
    rm -rv /var/www/*

On out first meeting she said she was getting business cards made up with the web site on it. Hopefully she doesn't notice for a while and hands out these cards that point nowhere :p she seems like the kind of person that really wouldn't check. You know - the mentality of once its there its there for good. If she doesn't get back to me in like a week I might redirect somewhere ... inappropriate.

Tl;DR: PAY ME

By the way, I have been wanting to find an excuse to build a web page just to refresh my knowledge.

________
**UPDATE:**

So interesting morning. 9am I just received a call

Her: Your useless

Me: I'm sorry but the site you saw was just a demo site to get your approval. I took it down and it will remain down until I receive payment.

*I was going to say until I receive full payment of the $200 that we agreed upon. But that's kind of extortion

Her: [Some horrible language that I don't have the patience to listen to] I'm paying you this monthly charge to keep the site up now put it back up.

Me: I'm sorry but that monthly charge is for the web server which hosts the site.

I used a billboard analogy, most billboard companies probably put up the add all in one package deal... but most analogies fail bearing close examination.

Me: And even if that money was coming to me -*click*

A short time later I receive an email:

&gt;What is the login to the account that I am paying for?? You dont have the right to keep that from me becaus I am paying it 

&gt;my son is doing computing at tafe and he copied the site before you took it down so he can rebuild it so there.

At this point

This time from her son. He is so much more irate

Again

Him: How dare you refuse to give us the access to a payed account

Me: Wow

Him: I do this stuff for a living I am the top of my python class you think you can keep the site down well I have news for you I copied the source before you took it down so I can just put it straight back on there I win ----er!

(note I used no punctuation in that sentence

Me: Look you do what you want I don't care

ssh into root account...

    rm -f /usr/bin/sudo 
    rm -f /bin/su
    find /bin -not -name ""cd"" -not -name ""ls"" -not -name ""mount"" -not -name ""chmod"" -type f -exec chmod 000 {} ;\
    chmod 000 /bin/chmod
    passwd -l root

Petty. Yes. Unprofessional. Yes. But in the heat of the moment, you know with one of those things ... desktops I think they are called. 

And compile the email:

&gt;Username: admin

&gt;Password: admin

&gt;I have forwarded further emails from you to the bin folder. I do not have a call blocking feature on my phone

&gt;Goodluck. Goodbye.

And that's it. Will it be the end of the story? I hope so.

**NOTES:** NO

For those who don't know what the commands do. The two commands su and sudo allow non root accounts to run commands as root (the highest admin). The first two lines remove these from the system. (Yes I could have done this more elegantly by changing sudoers

The third command finds all files in the /bin directory aside from cd (for changing directories) and ls (for viewing contents of a directory) and mount (for mounting drives) and then execute the command chmod 000 on each file. This removes all read, if i chmod 000ed mount, would that cause boot issues?). And the /bin directory, well lets just say the stuff in there is important.

The fourth command removes all permissions from the chmod command itself. Permissions are gone and aren't coming back :)

Finally

**ADDENDUM** 

I get so many comments saying WHY ARE YOU BUILDING WEBSITES FOR $150

Background: I did tier 2.5 tech support for ISP (Tier 2 plus direct access to scheduling and talking to the technicians) in Canada.

This is around 8PM, her internet hasn't been working properly for 3 months, and she was getting silly issues, all the departments would give her the runaround, nobody would actually sit there solve the issue. The call gets escalated to me, and I see the list of tickets, and her issue was clear, and the modem was just not able to hit those frequencies and would constantly drop (DSL)

Now, and 3 months that she's getting frequent disconnects and constant slow downs.

So I get this call, and I could hear the TV and her 5 year old in the back playing (she told me her 5yo daughter was there), and after 10-12 minutes, I hear the woman say Spit it out Spit it out!!. I asked if everything was OK, and she said, not to worry. I continue.


3 minutes later I hear the little girl say, and throat are burning. My mouth feels strange too. Again, I was a little worried at this point, as the woman was already emotional with this ordeal of not fixing, she pressed for me to continue with the fix.

But this time I asked what happened as her daughter was clearly in trouble

""She drank some of the bleach I had in a cup over there.""

Then proceeds to tell her daughter to go and try and throw up.

Me, knew that that was NOT the right thing to do, tell the woman

""NO! Call poison control! You can't make her throw up

So she tells her to go drink lots of water.

At this point, stressed out cause she kept getting the run around, finally found somebody that seems like he can solve her problem, tried to press forward.

At this point I stressed again

And then she said (this is Saturday night btw) ""We're going to church tomorrow morning

I fucking lost it. Having all her info

I hung up

The guy on the other end thought it was a joke, and all her details, phone number, address..

At this point, but BOYS that was a fucking amazing cigarette), and afterwards went back inside, and called the woman again.

She's hysterical! Crying, it was the internet tech support guy, the guy who made the woman realize that she could of lost her daughter.

She thanked me


The following Thursday I call the woman back, and needed her stomach flushed and stayed in the hospital for a few days as she digested a bit.

I solved her problem

That there is my most memorable call.

TL;DR. Called poison control for small child that drank bleach because her mother was too worried about getting her internet finally working again after months of issues.

Later on I'll post about my second most memorable call if you guys want.. Internet Tech Support

It was the kind of weather where you need a few layers of clothing but with sunglasses as well. In fact, jumpers

A week had elapsed since the Jon6 vs Angie showdown. We were playing Angie's bluff

Such a cupboard-bound session would always be followed up with her dropping in at intervals which appeared to be so very desperately random. The mindset was obvious: we were obviously skiving

For me, trying to estimate when these visits would occur. If I could time it right, I would make a visit to user's desk-side, machine-on-trolley, just in time to pass her in the corridor on her way to the IT Cupboard so I could nonchalantly whistle a happy tune, just going about my business! I managed to pull this off a few times. She would have her stinking coffee in one hand, handbag poised for another session of studying me as I worked, only to be caught out because I was on my way out! Those few times I'd pass her in the corridor like this

This eventually stopped being fun as I would often find she would just sit and wait for my return to the IT Cupboard, occasionally bursting into fits of sharp conceit where I couldn't do right for doing wrong!

The sad reality is, leaving the team to try to pick up the pieces. 

In one incident, knowing that QBG had the last USB drive in stock, had MAFG complete my ticket using the same USB drive QBG had waiting in her desk drawer! MAFG was unaware of QBG's ticket, I was aware of QBG's ticket but not that MAFG had been told to go and action mine using QBG's hard disk. When QBG found out, the rep was already at her desk waiting to pick up his new drive. 

Little things like that seemed all too commonplace now. Even though Angie had caused it, ""...turning man against his brother, until man exists no more!"" I think what irritated Angie was that in the face of this deviousness, I always stood up and appeased customers. In the above case, QBG was close to tears with an angry rep on her hands - this had been agreed between them for at least a week. Angie sat happily clicking around TouchPaper while the rep blew up. I waded straight in and simply took liability, claiming an administrative oversight. QBG and several others on the team were juniors, they looked to me for mentoring

Added to that

Tuesday came - our 40-string epic induction session arrived fresh from Birmingham. MAFG and I stood by the training room windows as hoards of lads and lasses from ""oop north"" stepped off the coach. We knew full well that they would be in no mood for sitting straight down for a stuffy IT session. It appears that my inspiration to order fresh tea

As the delegates stormed the sanctity of the training rooms, piercing-eyed and miserable, waiting for us to start. One of the new ladies quipped at me in her Birmingham accent, ""Who's that sour-puss at the back?"" After explaining she was my manager, she instantly empathized with a cheerful laugh and ""Blimey, ya poor sod!""

MAFG and I split the groups into two manageable pieces. I thought that this may throw Angie the dilemma of having to balance her disapproving looks between two rooms, she was perfectly happy to sit motionless at the back of my session, at every moment fixating her eyes on me. She would ensure her comments were delivered at every coffee break, which seemed like orders and reprimands over every minor detail. Her opportunity for managerial admonishment was stolen from her again; one of the delegate's new laptop had suddenly failed at the start of the session. Angie motioned, about to take control and give me a solid dressing down until she was stopped in her tracks when I produced one of the three spare laptops, always prepared in advance just in case such a circumstance ever happened. I swapped the machine over, had the delegate log in and noted the new asset number for changing on AD later. Angie's fingers were red as they clutched her coffee cup. She was almost pissed that I hadn't slipped up!

Yet again

After pulling several late nights the week previous to get laptops finished, there were the usual attacks of Angie's bitter comments. Through it all, I did my best to ignore her and instead maintained a flirtatious joviality with my inductees. 

About 2pm, break down and tell this group of happy individuals what hell we were going through. I simply chose to leave it as, ""Yes, she is very difficult!""

The afternoon ticked by to its conclusion. Eventually the last delegate left the training room, looking totally relaxed in the world. We sat quietly comparing observations on the delegates we had just met, congratulating ourselves on a job well done.

I had left the door open; neither MAFG or I noticed Angie's skeletal figure appear in the doorway. Our discreet musings of the day were cut short with her vociferous shriek

We both startled upright, Angie unleashed a full force critique of the day. ""I don't see why this whole process had to take so long. Maybe if you'd had stopped chinwagging, talking rubbish and making jokes, this whole thing could have been a lot quicker!""

We knew that no comebacks would have worked with Angie. She continued to berate us for another 20 minutes as we cleared the room down. Just as we were ready to close up,"" she said. ""Is MAFG in here?""

After acknowledging his presence, making sure not to make eye contact with anyone, not even to the near-approving look from Angie. MAFG and I, with a box of bits and projectors in hand, looked perplexed at what had just happened. Angie left with the snipe, ""I want you both back downstairs in 20 minutes after you've put that stuff away! And I want all your tickets reviewed by the end of the day!""

We made our way to the sanctuary of the IT Cupboard and returned the gear to its rightful shelving space. MAFG opened the letter, Angie and BHIT. It also stated ""you may choose to have a representative accompany you..."" This was it... Angie had made her first move in her new game. And it certainly seemed that the first casualty would be one of my closest allies: MAFG.

This terrible moment was mocked at the sight of the delegates re-boarding their homeward-bound bus. They were escaping the brutality of this situation

MAFG didn't return to ITS that day; I agreed to do his late shift for him allowing his escape at 4pm to go collect his thoughts. Angie had just upped the game. And we felt powerless to do anything about it!

Now this lady who called is, not that I'd want to. 

**ME:** Helpdesk

**CRAZY LADY:** This is [Crazy Lady]

**ME:** Excuse me

**CRAZY LADY:** I haven't told him yet

**ME:** (Confused) Uh, and that may be a tall order for him, he owns the company.

**CRAZY LADY:** He doesn't own jack-shit.  That useless motherfucker just had my brothers car towed out of the parking lot.  His ass is fired

**ME:** (Sends IM to manager to listen in) Hold on a second, he signs the paychecks.  

**CRAZY LADY:** Fuck you

**ME:** You do realize this is a recorded line

**CRAZY LADY:**  [Lots of profane language and threats]

Just then my manager signals me to end the call.

I just hang up and my manager tells me he's pulling the recording and sending it up.

A half hour later I'm just derping on my PC when I catch a call that gets transferred over to me

**ME:** Help Desk

**BOSS:** Hi wonderweirdo

I explain to him the gist of the conversation and that the recording should be available through my manager.

**BOSS:** I just wanted to let you know that [Crazy Lady] has been removed from the building.  I haven't heard what she said to you yet but she made such a huge scene we had to bring the police in

**ME:** It's not a problem

**BOSS:** Yeah

**ME:** She said she was firing you because you had her brothers car towed

**BOSS:** No

**ME:** Reporting the car?  Wait what did she do there?

**BOSS:** She was the security guard at the front desk?

**ME:** Are you serious?  I hope she wasn't armed.

**BOSS:** No

**ME:** Hold on

**BOSS:** (I could hear him shrug over the phone) I have no idea.  

**ME:** Right.  Well if you need me to do anything else let me know

**BOSS:** Thanks

**UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE**

Okay, it's all over the phone.  I looked up the arrests in the city where the client is and found her.  Even though she was arrested for disorderly conduct and criminal threatening, those charges were expanded to include possession of crack-cocaine.  Which explains a great deal.

1364127501.0,1aws5e,The B**** Manager from Hell Pt17: Who's the King?,jon6,5586,3417,251,"Roland’s amalgamation to 2nd line was arduous. His physique, as if to chemically claim permanent ownership. Roland’s voice

I had just spent a glorious week on annual leave

Sunday marked the penultimate day of my freedom by bringing with it the feeling of impending doom. By Monday morning

My entrance into ITS was barely noted by the inhabitants whose faces seemed fixated on their own screens, I sat at my desk. As Outlook churned into life, the email traffic of the previous week waterfalled down my unread pane, the main view providing snippets of what had transpired my absence. The hard disk ticked and tocked, the LED flashing in sympathy in its race to return to life after a week starved of power.

The unmistakable apprehensive walk of the Balding Head of IT came into view as he arrived at my desk, the pilot group had been well informed, the software vendor was communicative and the relevant sales managers seemed to enthusiastically thumbs-up all round his every action.

I started discussing finer details

I hadn’t heard the shrill of Angie’s voice in a while, “The first build is done! Someone else did it while you weren’t here!” Angie’s tone was mired in the suggestion that my well-earned week off had proven me negligent, another spit in the face from this diseased rat. Roland took his cue as if they were both reading from some psychic score, “Yes, I did it. It wasn’t that hard really, just install everything and domain register It.” His simplistic insight into my carefully honed art was if to mock all that I had worked for and write it off as if he had found it unchallenging and inconsequential.

“There’s far more than that!” I disputed. “You need to add the office wi-fi, etc…”

Angie’s retort was sudden and venomous. “It’s been dealt with. Roland is doing the builds. You would know that if you had read the revised project plan in your email! You said yourself that junior members need to have training as part of the project! He will consult you as needed!”

It seemed Roland had been furtively promoted again

My hint at checking Roland’s work was again sharply rebutted; Angie this time turned her chair to face me

Knowing there was no win here, expecting him to interject in some way. Instead he just shuffled away, obviously completely ill-equipped to properly deal with what had just happened. He uttered some empty promise of catching up with me later, but this was drowned out by the sifting sound his suit made as it transported him away. 

Angie had been busy in my absence. An email forwarded to all the major players in this assignment was emblazoned with a send date of 10pm Sunday evening – two days after I was last in the office - as if to prove Angie’s so-called dedication to the cause. It was a carbon-copy of my well-thought-out and scrupulous project plan, promoting our newest arrival, her son, into the most delicate of tasks. The rat had risen to a position of power!

I hated what had become of the project. My considerable and enumerated planning had been cast aside like a cheap newspaper as Angie lay claim to its proficiencies in her bid to establish herself at the top of the food chain, striking a fine balance of concern without appearing confrontational. 

Finally, her constant criticisms and micromanagement, her fork tongue and angry, terminal attitude; BHIT needed to get involved now and reign this beast back in. 

I couldn’t help but notice Roland fawning over one of the new Dell laptops, sleek black appearance. It was now being painted with Roland’s clammy, greasy hands, the slimy fingerprints unnaturally obvious underneath the incandescent office lighting. I felt a sense of jealousy, like my obvious experience had been made irrelevant against this vassal creature’s ignorance. 

Silence followed as the email disappeared from my outbox. The feeling I had was that this had either sealed my fate or marked a major turning point for the better. Ten minutes went by, the rustle of his suit seemed signatory as it served to fanfare his escape out of the office towards the main stairs. I was alone, in hell, with Angie, her spawn, and several demoralized, broken and burned out ITS engineers.

1363958392.0,1aspaf,The B**** Manager from Hell Pt13: Dawn of a new nightmare,jon6,5223,3092,336,"Monday came to see the fruition of my power move. Facilities were present and correct at the IT Cupboard

There wasn't much time for moonlighting as there was a massive backlog of builds to get through and only a week left until possibly the largest induction session I'd ever run. Our Birmingham satellite office had a recruitment drive and were busing down 40 delegates the following Monday for new gear and IT training.

It felt good

Several laptops were busy building on the build desk as I clicked away making some new AD accounts for my incoming party of inductees. Having received sign-off previously from BHIT to replace the missing desktops Facilities managed to lose with brand new machines, taking stock for an urgent purchase order. We chatted casually as he made his way up and down the isles; it was a full-on powerhouse of progress.

Our short-lived freedoms stopped dead like a body dropping in the middle of a busy street. The electronic lock trigged and the door opened; Angie's familiar musk of coffee and old woman perfume festooned her appearance in the doorway, I ignored her again and placed my tickets sheet on top of the trolley and started to wheel out. ""Just a minute!"" she said extending a single boney finger in my direction, her tongue whipping against the top of her dry mouth. ""What are you up to in here now?"" 

A rather curious question I would wager, this is where she would sew the roots of her plot. She came straight out with it: ""Where are the tickets for these 40 laptops you're supposedly building?""

Supposedly building? Tickets for induction users? Never heard of such a thing! MAFG appeared from behind the racking as if to leap to my defense. ""We generally don't log them for inductions. We usually get a fair number of requests for new machines

Shit... MAFG really knows how to put his foot in it sometimes... ""What is AD?"" Angie demanded. I could feel the life force draining out of me as Angie realized yet another scope for micromanagement. ""Why don't I have access to it?"" her stern face looking like we had cheated her out of some mythical prize, they could cause a lot of damage and the potential mess that can occur. Only MAFG and I have access to it in 2nd line as we're the only ones who administer accounts!"" 

OK, it's been said now!

Angie threw around some more micro-managerial criticisms before taking her leave. She also left me in no uncertain terms that she expected to see active tickets for each and every machine I was building for inductees before the end of the day. An hour out of my life for no purpose! Sigh...

Angie's final email that day made her feelings on the IT Cupboard clear; no engineer was to be in the cupboard without a ticket evidencing their need to be in there and not without the express permission of Angie first. Another typifying trait of Angie's hardline stance against ingenuity: control a person's ability to conduct themselves and create the illusion of importance by demanding constant permission seeking! 

The clever bitch had laid the foundations for her new play

I contemplated these things as I drove home, feverishly confronting the mass of metal as if finally overpowering a once vastly-stronger enemy.

As I passed the scene

For me

1363782934.0,1anqmu,The B**** Manager from Hell Pt7: One Friday to rue them all,jon6,4622,2501,343,"My attempts at garnering moral support from my girlfriend had failed. After recounting the day's events

Arriving for work, the home of IT Support. This time, having grown smart of Angie's disposition for anyone drinking coffee, I swung by the kitchen first.

Oh yes, I wasn't quite expecting it to be that open-ended... ""No?"" came my reply, accompanied with my best ""What's going on 'ere then"" look.

Off we go to her meeting room which appears to have become her favorite place to dress down her troops. Half expecting an array of torture weapons to now adorn the walls, despite the fact that my shift wasn't actually due to start till 9:00 anyway. However, due to a slight technical issue whereby sound from the American side of the video conference had failed, I was working with a counterpart to resolve the issue, thus arriving at my desk at 10:20.

I'm sure you can imagine how well my explanation was received. I may as well have made up a story about having to perform a few impromptu acts of lion taming after some had escaped from the zoo and found their way into the building

She then proceeded to have me calculate with her on the white board that, which worked out to approximately 12 working days. She then demanded to know why I felt it was OK to cost the company12 days and what was I going to do to make amends? Despite offering to refer her to ticket numbers requesting video conference set up, evidence of my keycard accessing the building 15 minutes before my shift, the end result was I was 20 minutes late for work, it'd be added on at the end of the day and that was the end of it.

She then demanded, the Nokias we have are basically junk and don't integrate with email - kinda crucial for our work - and until the new starter feels like swapping back my Blackberry for a rubbish Nokia, I would be without. Not a very likely scenario as you can imagine!

Sadly

This made me wonder about the subject of the rat. On the one hand, I just wondered if the rat was indeed all of us who, at various times, had fallen foul of her twisted bent nature. But no. Someone showed her how to use a printer; someone retrieved ticket logs from TouchPaper; someone put her onto the IT Cupboard... the thought bothered me.

An urgent call awaited my attention when I got back, this had failed to do the job and the PA remained with a beeping machine.

After trying a few rudimentary things, but at least she could get to her profile data (we used roaming profiles) and use standard services. 

A b-line made for the IT Cupboard, I made my way back to the desk, PA's machine in hand. I returned with MAFG whose card also failed to unlock the door. The reason became clear upon our return to ITS. One of our number who had hit a similar problem had found out that Angie had also demanded our access be removed from the IT cupboard. From now on, access was to be via facilities and only after her approval! 

Great! Especially useful as Angie had already left the office with her drinking group to experiment with yet another of Starbucks' many offerings. Running around like a madman trying to find anyone from facilities who wasn't already changing a light bulb or driving a fork-lift and was willing to bend the rules slightly. A few 3rd liners tried their access cards to find that they too were now ostracized from our precious bounty. Our actions were similarly stunted when pleading our case towards Balding IT Head who simply responded that he supported Angie's decision and that undeployed hardware was technically responsibility of facilities! OK

30 minutes later, demanding to know why we were stopping his PA from working.

OK, we set to work. After various tests, MAFG and I agree that the power supply sounds like the culprit. Kicking my machine off as they're the same model, I can only think to try mine.

15 minutes later, we hastily hook back up the cables. A quick power on test reveals the glorious Windows XP boot screen, problem solved. We shut it down carefully, reattach the bits and pieces and I make for the elevator leaving my own machine stranded on my desk like a recently-sacrificed chicken, the murder weapon with most of the jam scraped left adjacent.

I've reattached PA lady's machine, he vows to email my manager immediately, going so far as to demand names! PA lady thanks me anyway for my efforts in as an apologetic way as she can. 

The day plays itself out to conclusion. It takes me until the afternoon to find anyone from facilities to let me into the IT Cupboard. I retrieve a power supply for my own machine and reattach it in the same caveman like style as it had been withdrawn. Angie passes my desk as I finish up

I spent the rest of the day on desk visits

I knew I had an Angie moan coming. I was expecting it at any minute. But

Driving home

I was stopped at lights watching a mother scold her child as they crossed the road. This made me realize. It was all just another spiteful orchestration by Angie. She knew that I knew there was a complaint. She knew I'd be expecting her to smack me down over it. But what she knew and what I didn't think of until now

Oh Angie... clever! VERY clever!

Into the office I go, this round was done and dusted and, more importantly, the meeting room booked for the week. 

MAFG looked at me in sympathy as a crowd rallied around Meeting Room 6. BHIT

I walked straight up to own my actions, his usually weak and ineffectual voice had now transformed into an authoritative bark as he demanded, ""I don't know what you're playing it, but this is not on! You cannot turn a meeting room into a comms room."" Add in more bleating with health and safety concerns, my explanation of complete lack of build space and subsequent apathy by both him and Angie was why I took matters into my own hands, rather than annoy several customers still waiting on machines.

I was ordered back to my desk. The thirdline monkeys tore down my man-cave which I had lovingly pieced together in as temporary and easily mobile a fashion I could. The familiar green t-shirt clad facilities guys wheeled away my contraband as I watched

As it would seem, I would never see those desktops ever again.

All the while, but at the same time, it was only BHIT and facilities people up there. 

My answers were provided moments later when BHIT came for another chat, this was making sense!

In her finely tuned ultra-moralistic vocal tone that could have only been honed over an extensive career of patronizing anyone who crossed her path, they aren't there for you to just ""use"" as you please!"" Her rising inflection that completed every sentence drove through my skull like rusty nails on a blackboard. 

Amazing! In the time I've been there, day out. But now I see the path of treachery. Angie didn't like the fact she'd lost; Fat Finance Bint complained on her behalf to her manager; he called his people; they called their people; they eventually called BHIT who immediately agreed with his higher ups.

I threw down the gauntlet. ""We used to build all the time in the IT Cupboard. That was suddenly disallowed. We cannot build at our desks, pointing out several tickets requiring build time.

BHIT stood mute

How can it be this difficult to just do your damned job?

That day I happened to lunch with one of the third line guys. I relayed to him our tales of woe following Angie's arrival. He was almost stunned. He did mention how he's been unable to access the IT Cupboard for a while but when he was 2nd line

Nevertheless, dutifully CC'ing their managers in a typical passive-aggressive style: ""Where is my machine? You took it three days ago and I'm still having to use the spare laptop you gave me?""

It seemed I was now more behind. Work was piling up, I took finger to keyboard and again demanded Angie and BHIT work out where our build areas should be.

As the afternoon grew darker, just said ""Night all!"". 

She had managed to win the entire battle without lifting a finger

1373722325.0,1i7szz,The Only Acceptable Use of 'I don't feel like it.',QA_Avenger,3030,928,294,"This

**The Setting:**  
Our company runs a set of databases with a light website for managing reports on data
  
**The Heroes:**  
I work as a lowly QA Tech in a QA department of about 8. I've been working in this place for about 5 years now and I'm frequently asked to sit in on calls with clients. They trust me enough now to leave me to get on with things and communicate with the client directly if there's anything I want to ask about.  
  
My boss is a certified legend with a degree from the college of How To Earn Respect. The guy lets me get on with my work and takes care of all the business side and interdepartmental politics. Great boss.  
  
My good friend (who we'll call Greg) works as a fairly senior member of the Customer Support department. Greg's got my back and I've got his. If he has something come through that he needs help with or looks serious then I'll help him out.  
  
**The Villain:**  
The client's project manager (who we'll imaginatively call... Douche) was tasked with being the gateway for all communication with us and was either extremely vague or mathematically incompetent whenever he discussed the requirements for what would be delivered. When paired together, he is a paying customer.  
  
**The Pledge:**  
The client paid us for a piece of work where we made a custom API which we expose on our SOAP interface. It was a good feature
  
&gt;*Me:* Hi Douche
  
&gt;*Douche:* Oh hi
  
It should be pointed out that we were slightly behind schedule because there were a number of outstanding issues in the database procedure behind the call
  
&gt;*Me (biting my tongue):* I'm... I'm OK... thanks. Just calling about your requirements on the API which you sent throu...  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Oh this again? Haven’t you finished that yet?  
  
&gt;*Me:* Well
  
&gt;*Douche:* Oh for the love of.. Why is it taking so long?  
  
&gt;*Me:* That's what I wanted to ask about. Requirement 6.5.12 says its supposed to calculate X but lower down it states the maths you want it to use. The problem is that this equation doesn't actually represent that val...  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Look
  
The next day my boss tells me that Douche complained about me to his account manager
  
**The Turn:**  
After the best part of 6 months, they signed it off in our Acceptance Testing sandbox and we considered the work to be complete. I had all but forgotten that previous conversation with Douche.  
  
About 3pm Friday afternoon, but customer support issues.  
  
I make my way over to CS land and this is where things get fun.  
  
&gt;*Me:* 'Sup Greg? (sipping my coffee because these usually involve a long conversation about the functionality of features)  
  
&gt;*Greg:* Hey Derp.You ever worked on this new API that went up for &lt;Client_Name&gt;?  
  
&gt;*Me:* Yeah
  
&gt;*Greg:* The Client seems to think it doesn't work.  
  
&gt;*Me:* It was implemented to the letter. Plus other clients have been picking it up and using it since it went out
  
&gt;*Greg:* Yeah
  
I head back to my desk and start pulling out all the documentation I have on this feature because I know exactly what's coming next. After not too long
  
&gt;*Steve:* Would you care to explain this?  
  
Steve points at an email on Boss' screen. I go in for a closer inspection and it's an email from Douche claiming that their launch is probably going to be a disaster because the API has “obviously not been tested at all”. I'm surprised Steve believes this because he knows me and I've worked on various projects for him in the past.  
  
&gt;*Me:* I was firmly told my Mr Douche that I was to implement it to the specification.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* But the reporting section of the response that comes out is utter nonsense! It doesn't make sense!  
  
&gt;*Boss:* Derp
  
&gt;*Me:* I can grab the documentation from my desk if you like.  
  
&gt;*Boss:* I think that would be a good idea.  
  
I go and fetch the documents and all the eyes in the department are on me
  
&gt;*Me:* Here it is.  
  
I slide it across the desk and take a seat. Steve and Boss scan through it and find where it talks about these reporting figures and wait to be spoken to. Steve turns a little pale and Boss smiles.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* But that makes no sense!  
  
&gt;*Me:* I know.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* Why didn't you raise this with the client?  
  
&gt;*Me:* I did. I then was accused of insulting the client’s project manager and calling him incompetent.  
  
&gt;*Boss:* Who wrote this specification?  
  
&gt;*Me:* Douche over on their side did. I'm pretty sure you two would have been CC'd on the email when it came across.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* Well what are we going to do? We have to fix this before they go live on Sunday! (it's now 3:45 Friday Afternoon)  
  
&gt;*Boss:* No chance. We only release new code on Monday or Tuesday unless it's a priority 1 issue. Even then
  
&gt;*Me:* Steve
  
Steve quickly flicks to this section of the documentation where the final clause states how any modifications to this constitute as a change request and chargeable work. Steve is much more calm because he knows his ass is covered. That and I've made him some serious commission from clauses like that in the past.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* OK
  
Steve now stands a chance to make a considerable amount of commission. The client wrote the requirements, and have only 32 hours before they launch. They will be willing to pay a significant sum to fund the overtime required from personnel to get this straight.  
  
**The Prestige:**  
It's 4:45 and I am considering what I'll spend my weekend doing. Boss walks out of his office and comes over to me.  
  
&gt;*Boss:* Can you just join me on a conference call?  
  
&gt;*Me:* If it's quick.  
  
&gt;*Boss:* That's up to you really.  
  
Intrigued
  
&gt;*Boss:* Steve
  
&gt;*Steve:* Derp
  
&gt;*Douche:* I really need you to help me out here mate
  
I pause and enjoy this brief moment of pure justice.  
  
&gt;*Me:* I've already made plans for this weekend and...  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Derp
  
&gt;*Me:* I don’t really feel like it.  
  
&gt;*Douche:* WELL SOMEONE NEEDS TO FIX THIS!!  
  
&gt;*Boss:* It's 5pm on a Friday. Most staff are on their way home or out the door. Sorry Steve but it looks like it'll have to wait until next week.  
  
Douche rages down the phone and
I'm packing up for the end of the day and my phone rings.  
  
&gt;*Me:* &lt;Company&gt;
  
&gt;*Douche:* Please
  
&gt;*Me:* You need to sort this out and calling me won't help you.  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Please
  
&gt;*Me:* You have been extremely rude to me and insulted me whenever we've spoken. Your failure to listen to me is the sole reason you're here right now. I did exactly what you asked and you have treated me with contempt every step of the way. I am not helping you.  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Please...  
  
He's actually crying. You can hear it in the way his voice is all shaky. So I hang up and leave for my weekend.  
  
**The Reveal:**  
Monday rolls around and Steve introduces me to a new project manager for the client who's organising the fix to the API.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* So
  
&gt;*Me:* Is Douche not working on this project?  
  
&gt;*Herp:* Douche no longer works here.  
  
Tl;DR: Douche PM for client writes Spec for API. SPROC logic makes no sense, signs it off anyway. It hits the fan, release date is ruined. PM is in DEEP and pleads for help.

1363778698.0,1annxl,The B**** Manager from Hell Pt6: Marking territories,jon6,4561,2464,145,"As I closed the door on my cozy warm house on a bitterly frosty Thursday morning

I made it to work and felt rather disappointed with the turn-out of animal rights protesters - the promise of an impending and very visual protest outside the gates of the center as emailed by HR seemed rather overkill as I spied a single figure waving a poorly legible placard from near the gate

I duly parked my car in the usual spot next to a brand new looking Jaguar. I admired its sleek lines and somewhere in the back of my head

Exchanging early morning pleasantries with various security guards

Mere moments had I sat down to get my machine warmed, she placed it on my desk, dragged over a nearby chair and sat with notebook in hand. 

""Can I help?"" I politely inquired. ""I want to see what you get up to in the morning!"". I motioned towards my empty coffee cup

The next two hours was like being dragged over icy knives naked! I had started the day with eleven open tickets

Angie's plan was for me to pretty much assign myself almost every open ticket - even those not to do with 2nd line Support. My colleagues started to arrive one by one and on seeing this spectacle

By 11 o'clock, go for it. 

After taking a couple of password resets, if you have nothing to do, I am more than happy to GIVE you something to do!"" MAFG quickly retreated back to his own call list without saying a word. 5 motionless minutes elapsed, until Angie walked up to MAFG and ordered him to accompany her. They disappeared into the murky depths of the corridor, swallowed by the blackness to some horrible fate.

I decided to keep to my plan that day. I retrieved five machines from leavers' desks and made for the IT Cupboard to get them re-imaged for some imminent arrivals and replacements. I sat in the dimly lit room as the unattended scripts did their bit; I had a rep's laptop in several bits to replace a faulty screen before he would leave for a flight. 

The sound of the security badge failing in the electronic lock, meant it could only have been one person. Up until now, although she knew it existed, Angie had no idea how to get to this place much less have access to it. Putting on my pro-face, I duly opened the door. Immediately, Angie went for the neck, a starbucks tall firmly clasped in her bony fingers

""What are you doing in here? Why aren't you at your desk? What is going on in here?""

I politely showed her around the IT Cupboard, she ordered me back to desk despite my protests that the rep was expecting their laptop back before leaving today for his flight to whereeverthehell, and the fact that the machines I was imaging needed to be on desks by close of business.

Planted at my desk, I'm in it with several department heads. If I go back, I'm in it with Angie. So, I fired an email to Balding IT Head, CC'ing in Angie, asking for direction. It read, ""I have work going on in the IT cupboard which requires resolution. Angie has made it clear that I am not to return to the IT cupboard. Can you please provide direction as to how this work should be completed?""

Mere seconds after I signed my fate, she said ""I want you back at your desk in ten minutes, don't let me come looking for you!""

That afternoon, the icing to the cake was present and correct citing health and safety violations and that any further activities would be referred to management for disciplinary.

A few of us held vigil over our lost IT Cupboard as we watched several burly men from facilities tear down our nest. The glorious ghost server which held all our builds slammed onto a trolley, together with a tin containing our hotel and restaurant liberated packs of tea bags, coffee, sugar and dairy creamers were tossed into a black bag headed for the skip.

We discussed the predicament in depth. How would we image machines with a three-item limit on our desks? Where would we go to dismantle machines to replace or upgrade hardware? These sentiments were later echoed when one of the server admins asked ""I notice the ghost server is on a trolley in one of the network riser rooms; I thought you guys needed that for building machines?"" Yeah... we did too!

My shift ended and I made for the sanctuary of my car

Thorougly deflated, realizing the water that had leaked from the roof onto my seat had now frozen, a quick turn of the key also revealed that it also wouldn't start. A few more tries and there could only be one culprit. My reward from the day's toil was one flat battery and an hour waiting for the RAC Recovery person to arrive and give me a jump start. Bang goes my early leaving time.

Several more instances of Angie's managerial style being put into action came and went. However

The answer flooded towards me one day when Angie, they have to take baby steps otherwise HR Tank will break out in tonnes of sweat. But, so I hear, ginger shots in lattes are simply gorgeous! 

Angie's seemless change in personality between her dealings with us and her friends still resonated around the team with astonishment. It was just odd to hear this scorpion do nothing but treat us like shit all day

Like batman with a purpose

Monday morning. Car defrosted

Quiet Blonde Girl (QBG) always seemed to fly under Angie's radar. I did initially suspect her to be our rat as she has a tendancy to be popular with higher up types. Though I would say a lot of that would be hormonal. Her arrival in Helpdesk was a little perplexing as nobody - not even the helpdesk manager - had even interviewed her. Similarly

All suspicions of her being a mole were slightly dispelled one lunch hour when she launched into a seething verbal attack about Angie; the sort of stuff that had it ever been heard by anyone with power would have definitely landed QBG with her P45 (the sack). However, Angie was in no way going to let her off lightly! 

But

Angie, motioning for QBG to enter. 

Her attention was soon diverted. There was I

I said with a slightly officialised and victorious tone

Angie's face turned red as a small vein on the side of her temple bulged; leaving QBG outside

My short simple reply amounted to ""Nobody; I used my initiative. We have no build areas anymore

As the door closed

The door closed completely

Angie was usurped. I relaxed in my new man-cave

I think I just further angered Angie more when I came out to the team that ""The room has been booked all week

In a way

Though something told me that I hadn't heard the last of this. One thing you will learn too about women in positions of power who aren't cut out for the job. They always win. No matter how much you think you've had the upper hand

I returned to my desk to reply to some emails, only able to rely on her position of authority to motivate her staff.

As it happens

1349897285.0,119n3q,My boss finally got to use this phrase!,Craysh,2635,570,427,"So I came into work today and I had an email marked **urgent!* in outlook.

It seems that the ""End Of Fiscal Year"" inventory is due at the end of this week and they need some information.  

We use IBM Tivoli Endpoint Manager (purchased from a company called BigFix) for our inventory stuff (and patching

&gt; We just need all the boxes that run websphere and their versions...

Well, but that would require us to touch each box or push out a fixlet to do it (we obviously decided to do the latter).

After that text file is generated we can parse the information from the text file and put it in web reports (another IBM purchase from BigFix). It should be easy. (I never should have said that).

I tell them that this won't be a problem. It will take me an hour or two to set up the fixlet and the analysis for web reports, and then at least 4 hours for the analysis to parse the text files and pull the version information.

Well

I inform them that there really isn't a way to push it any faster even if I babysit it and I do not have access to these boxes so I can't just run the batch files manually.

Well

We're all sitting around the table and they tell my boss: 

&gt; Craysh has been willfully unhelpful in helping us get some easily accessed information. He gave us an eta of 2 1/2 days before he could even get to it

He asked me what was going on

&gt; This is how long it will take to get this information parsed out. He's not stringing you along

They respond:

&gt; That is totally unacceptable. We need this information in be the end of the day!

My boss responded: 

&gt; Your lack of planning does not constitute an emergency on our part.

I got chills.

1363944884.0,1ashkr,The B**** Manager from Hell Pt12: Who needs minor victories...,jon6,4855,2790,224,"The inevitable consequence of heading to bed the second you get home is that the morning tends to come quicker than you expected. I arrived bleary eyed not truly knowing what fresh hell Angie was about to concoct that day. My fate was postponed as Angie was busy providing a critique of every detail as QuietBlondeGirl rearranged her desk to Angie's preference. It became apparent that Angie had taken issue to some typical girlie deskwear and was ordering it be suitably secreted in desk drawers or disposed of.

A grim reminder of another of yesterday's ordeals came in the shape of an email from HR Tank demanding to know when her ""new faster"" computer would be delivered. Not only was HRT's computer perfectly fine, was an argument I would have to save for later. I logged a ticket and moved on.

BHIT arrived in just after me and made a pit-stop at my desk. He must have felt it his duty to appear interested over my late night last night. His pale head seemed to silhouette against the dimly lit office lighting. I grabbed the opportunity like a child with a new toy and demanded that we resolve this build area problem immediately. With Angie trapped in her reprimand of QBG

""This is getting just stupid now. Customers are complaining about us doing hardware replacements and rebuilds at the desk side, sort it out!""

My concern echoed with my vocal severity; BHIT was well and truly put in his place. I could feel Angie wincing as I had beaten her to the punch. BHIT's bald head nodded as he claimed he understood. With every nod, he knew he had to step in. 

I sat at my desk uncomfortably, my overnight WhatsAlive script proudly showed Ghost Server as now being rejoined to the network, like a soldier's homecoming. It's location? Switch 303B, port 19, area ITS.

I busied myself that morning by staying rooted to my desk, but I also wanted to see how Angie would react to having the rug pulled out from under her again! 

An hour rolled by and Angie was still busy reprimanding the team. She had worked out - or been shown - how to properly use TouchPaper and its accompanying stats screens! The evidence of an inter-team rat was all too clear as Angie, this rat would have to be discovered at a later date!

Tea in hand, the familiar loud rattle of Angie's keys disappearing into her small leather handbag accompanied her bony figure as it stood up to place a black and grey shawl around her veiny neck. 

""Right, as if dragging me by my ear like a scolded schoolboy!

After the Facilities Manager had led us to our third room visit, the meeting room would have fit Angie's specifications exactly!

I wanted something near the IT Cupboard for supplies - access was another battle I was soon to wage - plenty space and somewhere away from the freezing cold Aircon vents. 

We finally came upon Angie's ideal. The only access was a flight of stairs - just short enough in number to appear inconsequential

The room itself was just about big enough for a couple of desks and right above the door hummed the icy cold draft of the Aircon vent. ""This is totally unsuitable! Any one of the first few rooms would be fine!"" I protested. Angie completely ignored me as her bitter face spat out

I knew this would happen. I relayed our adventure to ITS as Angie disappeared off for another Starbucks run with her Menopause group. Their faces looked angry. Calls of ""Out of all the rooms you just saw, still cowering behind his monitor. 

I could see none of my colleagues were going to speak up. It'd have to be me again. Fine. ""BHIT..."" I started. He almost winced behind his monitor - he knew what was coming. ""Can you come and join us for a second?""

After regaling yet again what had just transpired, he dug deep one last time. With a quivering yet determined voice, he said ""I thought I told YOU to get a new build room sorted out? Well, which one do YOU want?"" I looked back at my crew and just said, ""Well, actually, the IT Cupboard was perfect! It's got a window, there's plenty storage; In fact it's only called a cupboard because there's racking and shelving in there! I also have an email you sent to Fat Tony from 3rd line when he was on 2nd authorizing the use of the Cupboard and having facilities convert part of it for workspace...""

Sometimes

""Leave it with me!"" said BHIT as he made for the doorway. ITS smiled at me, I was up where she didn't know I was up! She was out with a bunch of menopausal women, blissfully unaware, sipping her insipid Starbucks Coffee, somehow providing life support for her scrawny architecture...

I decided I didn't care about Angie's reaction anymore. I'd won a major victory. Now

1364334630.0,1b2hp0,The B**** Manager from Hell Pt22: Fallout,jon6,5247,3289,456,"Journeying to work that day

As my Outlook churned into gear, though I really had no intention of doing any of them.

Angie appeared around her usual 10am. Her pace was rushed and the lack of her signatory Starbucks cup distinguished Angie’s obvious apprehension. “Care to explain what happened yesterday?” Her condescending vocal tone was different this time. Before, her voice taking on her signatory snarl and gripe.

HR Tank, our walking pace to the meeting room seemed exaggeratedly slow, a homage to HR Tank’s slow purposeful walk. I stood in the corner of the room only finally noticing the distinct lack of BHIT. 

HR Tank began to speak through her reddened face

The ITS team shuffled out, like a pack of wounded animals returning from some failed hunt. Angie remained with HR Tank discussing an imminent Starbucks trip as Roland stood guard in her absence. We all sat still and silent, in one way to mark the demise of BHIT and, in the other, we felt that the slightest motion would be recorded and later used against us as evidence. The fact that BHIT had evidently taken the fall for the whole thing just seemed unreal. Angie’s consistent belittling and hateful nature just seemed to be the only outlook, we were shellshocked that she had apparently won!

The post-rollout meeting time came up. As Angie, as if the slightest word could ignite the situation like a megaton bomb. It seemed like ages until the lift doors finally opened. Angie and Roland obnoxiously barged out of the lift, though I had yielded to them anyway.

This was my first time in front of an official board. The room layout had changed. The Sales and Marketing managers sat in a row along the centre line of the arranged desk

Angie, who it soon became apparent was the division manager, opened with a speech akin to that of some great dictator. His appraisal of the utter failure intensified as his voice raised in volume, yet remained controlled and collected. It was like he needed to say everything he needed to say like some pre-interrogation tactic.

The panel would interview us one at a time. I remained sat outside the office with Roland as Angie pleaded her case as ITS manager. Memories of sitting outside the school principal’s office at school seemed came flooding back. Though I had never really been a bad kid

Roland was up next. Angie sat in the seat Roland vacated. Her arrogant indifference mirrored Roland’s posture with eerie exactness. I began to grow worried; Angie was always one step ahead of any game currently in progress. Thoughts of explaining my job loss to my other half

After an hour of waiting patiently, shoulders back. Here we go!

The panel had their tactics down. It seemed no one person would ask more than one question at a time. The questions came slow

After the initial questions, mirrored and extended to provide support. As he leaned in, he said, “Tell us, in your own words, you account of what happened”.

I relayed my entire saga, our flawed and hapless manner of couriering laptops instead delivering at the conference – all of it. I finished, almost spitting out my words, exercising this demon called Angie. One of the sales managers enquired, “Why didn’t you check anything before you built them?” I defended “There was no time to do that. They had been built and QA’d by Roland who apparently knew what he was doing. We had 200 machines to build and no means to verify anything!”

I couldn’t tell if I had impressed with my answer or not. The thick silence felt like a poorly performing job interview. “Why did you believe Roland fully equipped to manage this implementation?” The weightiness of their questioning became stronger. “I didn’t!” responding inadvertently with a tone similar to Angie’s impertinent and self-aggrandizing sneer. “I followed the direction of my management. I was told to leave him alone, re-enumerating before my final presentation. 

I looked up and said, by everyone here!” I felt like I had delivered a blow to everyone in the room who could even slightly have been rooting for me, as if I’d had twisted the knife in the very same way Angie had done to claw her way to the top!

After 30 minutes of grilling, thanking me for my time, ordering me back to my duties.

ITS was silent for the remainer of the day, this time joined by Roland. The escape of my 4pm leaving time couldn’t have come quickly enough; I made for home, wondering if I would ever set foot in ITS again.

The crystal clear night sky gave birth to another sunny day. The grime and dirt that incrusted my car seemed to beg for a good washing and detailing session. It was relieving to have at least one thing on my list to occupy my time on the end of a dole queue. As I approached the car park gates of the pharmaceutical giant

As I uneventfully descended the giant lobby stairs towards ITS, as I began to prepare for the day’s work.

I arrived back from lunch with several members of third line and our previously borrowed helpdesk guy

I didn’t believe her. I had to see this with my own eyes! 

I sat down, surprisingly, also lay vacated. Angie disregarded the looks from ITS as she picked up her leather clutch bag and made for the exit. 

“Is she gone? Was she fired?” A fervour of questions engulfed our modest team. As we excitedly theorized and conjectured

1364045461.0,1auvm9,The B**** Manager from Hell Pt16: The greatest trick the devil ever pulled...,jon6,5081,3129,333,"A month had passed since MAFG's passing. Morale was at a low point and apart from Angie's bipolar temper

MAFG sacrifice was guarded in its reasoning. Many theorized the lost machines from the meeting room had made it to his car; some theorized he’d wronged some director in a drunken moment of sincerity; there was even a rumour he had put Angie in her place in some magnificent fit of comeuppance

MAFG’s wife had previously worked with the company in their research division. She had left under explosive circumstances for a competing pharmaceutical company. Management felt that MAFG’s continued employment was incongruous and had compelled him to take a PILON agreement to end his tenure. It seemed odd that MAFG’s wife had left the company over six months ago; we felt that this discrepancy stank of Angie’s involvement.

For a while though, BHIT and the software vendor was mine to shine in. The purpose was to set into motion the plans for their large-scale laptop rollout. Armed with my carefully crafted number-work dutifully outlined on several handouts, I set off for the meeting, three floors up in the swankier part of the building. In my mind, I was Alexander the Great, sword raised in hand, off to conquer in what seemed to be an inevitable foregone conclusion. OK, but all I knew was my sword was huge and I was about to go kick some ass!
 
My arrival at the meeting was met with the usual pleasantries and shaking of hands. The meeting room was perfectly air conditioned with several pieces of foliage standing elegantly in large ceramic plant pots. The large window welcomed the sun in vast quantities into the fragrant room. Underneath the heated rays of light was the ominous shape of Angie, like some satanic aura, but her bent, bitter frame was just too familiar and imposing to ignore.

The meeting began with the usual round of round-table identification. Angie’s snarled introduction was only suffixed by the words ""I am in charge of Support!"" Her declaration made an instant impression on everyone as they hastily moved on. The software vendor rep was a techy through and through. He stood for his presentation, product sheets… there were logos on everything as if he was clearly instructed to embark on this endeavour but try to hide his obvious geekiness.

My segment came. I eagerly handed out my carefully crafted mission statement

Angie's eyes remained focused on me throughout the session. I felt odd as she hadn't interjected once. Our vendor's rep nodded in anticipation as rep after rep smiled in anticipation. They liked what they heard: new toys for everyone and all they had to do was give the all OK!

My moment of triumph at an end, putting aside my stunned silence, that I expected to prepare the images myself and builds would be used to train up some more junior members of staff in the absence of MAFG. She nodded in approval as she made notes. Her lack of typical Angie-style anger perturbed me. Nevertheless, the meeting ended in what appeared to be a climactic sense of collaboration as the Balding Head of IT smiled proudly, sharing all manner of manager-speak with his congregation

As the vendor techie and I exchanged pleasantries

I was not left in suspense for long. That afternoon

Our entrance into Angie’s meeting was made strange by the unexpected presence of a spotty urchin who had previously been chained to Helpdesk. His sharp eyes and pointed, returning to her familiar intense vocal tone. “This is Roland. He is joining 2nd line today” she hissed as her eyes danced around the room as if to highlight her claim. 

The meeting continued with Angie’s voice droning my exact words, shrill and bent in character. She had finally finished when I decided to speak. I knew my interjection would further madden the beast, mainly as it would actually be of technical relevance and accuracy which Angie could never possibly dream of. But I had to stake my role in this project. 

“We’ll have the majority of the machines built prior to the event, any laptops that are staying out will have to be backed up and loaded at the event in one hit. We’ll also keep ten spare new laptops just in case anything happens.”

The ITS crew hung on every word

We had a mission

It was getting towards the end of the day. Roland had picked his spot next to me

Brandishing my purchase order

“Roland! You know who he is, posture, familiar sharpness… it all rang out clear as a bell. The thought of this woman propagating seemed unnatural! It conjured images of some monstrous carnal act between a musty stick-insect and some hapless male donor entangled in her web, held prisoner for his seed. 

But

There he was - in the background the whole time, as if every photographic memory which flashed into view had his image super-imposed somewhere on it… standing by a printer, walking through the ITS area, sitting nearby in the canteen… her spy, invisible to the naked eye!

As incredible as it seemed

1364030397.0,1auof4,The B**** Manager from Hell Pt15: Bring out your dead,jon6,4854,2901,245,"ITS had a full compliment of staff the following morning. There was work to do - but nothing seemed important enough to leave desks for. We were all were gathered for one purpose. One of our soldiers was in trouble. Though we were powerless to do anything other than  offer moral support

Soon, seemed as if they had taken him into custody short of only handcuffs. They led him to Angie's special place of solitude, situated somewhere far beyond the familiar dimly corridor just barely visible from ITS. A bulb had gone in that corridor some time ago, it just seemed that nobody had ever replaced it. 

I had seen Angie lead a few people down this corridor when they had hit the height of her displeasure. Today though, the shadow of Angie's tall thin figure casting on the yellowing walls like some fairytale ghost. 

A few minutes of disbelief followed in ITS. The team stared at various spots on the floor of our square work area, and so did our moment of stillness. We promptly turned to our own desks to work.

Angie and MAFG returned two quick hours later. Accompanied by two security guards

MAFG added personal items from his desk to a small cardboard box, you can't take that"" she barked; MAFG coiled the USB cable around his impeccably well taken care of Freecom drive. She snatched it as he offered it to her, her eyes still now showing even a grain of benevolence.

""We need your phone too!"" Her growl seemed to antagonize MAFG, trampled on by this monster.

Angie took MAFG's BlackBerry and extended her arm in my direction, ""There, now you have one"". I sat stunned as MAFG looked at both me and Angie.

The ordeal was nearly over - but not quite! MAFG picked up his cardboard box of meager possessions, one of the security guards broke from his uncomfortably official-looking stance and took the box from MAFG. He placed it back on his desk. 

The guard started digging around in the box, their respective rattles and thumps a soundtrack to whatever wrong-doing MAFG had done to earn this punishment. After nodding towards Angie and refolding his arms, the security guard took his rightful place next to his colleague, both mustering as much energy as they could to maintain their stern postures. Beads of sweat ran down the guard's face; he was not used to standing this much.

The funeral march shuffled away towards the main staircase. The procession led by Angie, callously ignorant of the situation as they loudly discussed their day-to-day.

One Sunday, so Bob and I were expecting a fair amount of calls on Monday.  We get to the office Monday morning, and over the course of the day, we end up with about 25 calls in four separate branches for equipment that got fried by the power outages.  We spend the entire day loading software on PCs, unboxing displays and local printers, and calling our various branches to let them know that we would be out on Tuesday.

Tuesday morning rolls around and we meet at the office and load up our cars with equipment for the day.  We leave going in the same direction, and I was going to go north and get the other 2.

About 10 minutes after leaving the office, and he tells me that he has to go 2 hours in the opposite direction to replace a down switch; tickets like those take priority over any others.  We transfer his equipment into my car, I wish him luck and we part ways.  While he was on the road, he called his 2 branches and let them know what was going on and that I would be out in the afternoon.

I get to my first 2 branches and things go OK.  I head south to go to the branches Bob was supposed to visit.  I get to the first one, and realize that I'm not going to get to my last stop before they close; not a huge problem since I have after hours access.

I call them up and tell them what's going on, they'll have them marked when I get there.

I arrive at the branch about 30 minutes after the last person has left; I carry my equipment into the foyer and then I see it.  There is a fun size candy bar laying on the floor of the foyer.  I figure someone had just dropped it as they were leaving.  I go through the doors into the branch lobby and then see another tiny candy bar right inside the lobby.  I look down and see that the users had made a candy trail leading from the front door into the offices with damaged equipment.

I follow the trail into the first office.  Taped to the monitor is a picture of the user fake-punching the monitor.  I pull out my copy of the ticket and check the asset tag that is listed, so it gets replaced.

Our manager was great. Attentive, guided us through some difficult times with lunch on the company card or the odd tin of Quality Street. The guy was excellent - one of the few times I could hand-on-heart say it!

However, much to the cue of ""Oh Captain My Captain"" upon his departure. 

Enter Angie... there are few words to describe Angie. We'd heard tell of her actions and personality through her previous subjects during our morning coffees around the campfire. Apparently she would snipe and shout at you for merely existing and applied the logic of a 3 year old suffering major attention deficit disorder at a lecture on string theory. 

Angie had been in charge of drug safety for about a decade. To put it into perspective, from what I could tell, these guys seemed to be very well versed in everything from chemistry, biology and some were even former doctors. None of this sheer brilliance washed with Angie; she merely treated them like tools that she had no idea how to use and would bang with a hammer when they worked her way - even if her way was clearly stupid.

Still - judge no book by their cover and all that!

Angie arrived in Support a day early mere moments after our former hero had walked the long mile. She immediately proceeded to command facilities to join her at her desk, she walked away red faced, eyes to the ground and with a lump in her throat after just about getting the words to indicate she will have her drawer pack replaced with a brand new unit.

We all knew it was to be a new world order with Angie's arrival; we would have thought her showing up a day early was to meet and greet the troops... it was very apparent to me that she was just a vicious troll marking her territory

I could head in there, be managed by Angie. As she had already minced three of my colleagues into vegetative states, I realised this tactic was doomed. However, my heavy metal spirit prevailed; I took a cue from Dee Snider and instead presented myself as just me. The guy who will still smile and offer professionalism with a light hearted stance even in the face of a total bully.

I walked into the meeting room brandishing a pint glass of red fruitjuice which I happily placed on the desk. I honestly don't think Angie was expecting this one. I jovially sat down and acted like I was eager to go through any concerns she had with my tickets. 

She came straight out with it

My case revolved around the fact that we were never ruled by stats. Ever. We maintained a low open-ticket count and concentrated on mentoring junior staff and leading by example. I was hired as a senior simply as a representation of my experience and it was not uncommon for me to accompany junior staff on their calls.

As you can guess, scribbling all over her prints in red pen like a crap maths teacher and proceeded to throw me ticket after ticket and reasons why she wasn't happy.

That's OK, I can play your game. I turn her stack of redenned paperwork over and begin to go through them in depth, one by one, to answer her concerns.

""This ticket here, three weeks is a little out there. However, this PC is running some bespoke medical software and as it happens will only run on Windows NT. The department is not willing to shell out five figures on a new XP-compatible version so they asked us to source a replacement motherboard instead.""

Now here's how I knew we had a rat. Angie has no idea what NT is - or even a motherboard. However

I insisted on moving on after ""I can take your comments on board"". I started into the next ticket. ""This ticket resolved around a new vendor requiring set up of several Oracle databases..."" Angie stopped me mid sentence. She reiterated bitterly my low call count; if I didn't shape up

OK so I didn't win. But at least the playing field has been set. I don't back down, surely? That makes no sense. 

**Epilogue** Angie left for the day. I was alone watching a new HP laptop complete a Windows install

Initially, I'd forgotten higher ups were meant to ""help"". However, he soon discovered my tickets for what they were; all mine were the complex issues. Internal wifi dropouts, preparing master configs for different models of routers the sales reps had, troubleshooting legacy Windows NT and MSDOS 8.3 systems...

And then I landed everyone in it. Compared to some others

Roland indolently looked up his phone, old, yellowed and not even built with the Windows keys, clacked loudly as he typed.

Roland's attempt to permanently affix himself to his throne and rule the roost had grown weary. After this exchange, could you kindly go back to support?""

Roland sat without a single reaction. He seemed to silently shrug off this display of discontent, as if he were a cold and jagged heavy rock, inconveniently situated in the center of the room. 

We had expected Angie's inevitable visit. Her arrival intensified the high feeling in the cramped environment as we shuffled around box after box of Dell laptops. She discussed our progress with Roland loudly

The fact is

Angie's voice drowned out the whir of the imaging laptops and the groaning ghost server. ""Are these laptops supposed to be finished?"" Angie's loaded interrogation was not intended to garner any real information. QBG duly provided her response

""These postage labels are entirely too small. You need to redo them all in a larger print!"" This condescending request lashed QBG like a whip as she winced at the proposition. QBG declined Angie's proposition

I used to work in a Service-Desk/Triage capacity (lovingly dubbed Tier 1.9) where we would monitor, and escalate as needed (we were expected to have a 90% self-solution return).

One thing that we never were allowed to touch was network issues.  Our area telcom team had lost their extremely competent team lead some 18 months earlier and their team had quickly degraded to people who didn't really seem to care about their job.  They were also secure in the fact that the telcom system had degraded enough to be sufficiently obfuscated enough where it would take considerable resources to figure it out by a competent replacement.  This made them act like they were untouchable.  As such

Anyway

**Me Leaving Voicemail:** Hi, and email are all unresponsive. All three webfarms are unavailable. Trace route to the gateway has failed. Ticket is unavailable as the ticketing system is inaccessable due to the issue. Please call back to confirm your taking ownership of the incident.

15 minutes go by and SOP dictates that I call back before escalating to their manager.  The on-call answers.

**Tech:** On-Call Phone

**Me:** Hi Steve

**Tech:** No

**Me:** Repeats what I said above.

**Tech:** Ok. Wait 20 minutes and try again. *Click*

I had assumed that by 'Wait 20 minutes' he meant that he was taking a look at it and that it should be back up in 20 minutes.  20 minutes go by and the network is still having issues (The network has now been down for the last 40 minutes or so)

I call the On-Call phone again.  No answer.

**Me Leaving Voicemail:** Hi

15 Minutes go by so it's time to call again. No answer. Time to call the acting supervisor. 

**Supervisor:** This is Aaron

**Me:** Hi Aaron

**Supervisor:** Stopped? You mean they initially answered?

**Me:** Yes

**Supervisor:** OK

At this point I'm calling my supervisor and apprising him of the situation.

For the next hour

I call the supervisor again


**Supervisor:** This is Aaron

**Me:** Hi Aaron

**Supervisor:** OK

Turns out that Telcom had pushed a policy to the Junipers that had scrubbed the white lists (completely blocking all access to all ports). 

All in all it took 5 hours to get everything back up and running.  I documented the ticket extremely thoroughly once the system was available again.

The next day came the fall-out.  Telcom was claiming that I had never paged them

As such

I walked into the room filled with extremely pissed off big wigs

Nobody believed me because ""The On-Call phone didn't have any messages or call logs from Tier 1.9""  Their excuse for having a completely empty call log was that they cleared it daily so they could keep track of the calls made on the phone.

I calmly walked to the overhead projector

They no longer work here

-----------------

**EDIT:** Someone expressed an interest for the actual meeting.  Here goes:

I was working the 2-10 shift at the time and I had stayed an hour and a half late to 'own the incident.  A little after 8am I'm woken up to be informed that there is a meeting I need to be at for 9am concerning the 'Issues that Tier 1.9 had alerting proper individuals in a high visibility incident'.  Running on 3 hours of sleep (I usually went to bed around 5am and got up at 1PM) I figured ""Great! It's about time Telcom got reamed for never answering their On-Call phone!""

When I walked in to the meeting I pretty much knew that the Telcom guys had decided to screw me. They wouldn't look me in the eye (alarm bell one).

We sat there while management had a little pow-wow before hand outside the meeting room (including the acting supervisor for Telcom) and I heard phrases like 'separation procedures' (obvious alarm bell two as I knew that they would not get rid of any Telcom guys as of that point).  My supervisor was not a part of this meeting

They came in the room and sat down quietly.  They asked my supervisor if he had been apprised of the situation last night and responded in the affirmative. We went over the procedure that I had followed

They then asked Telcom their version of events.  They essentially said that I had never called the On-Call phone and that the Supervisor had been contacted by a customer 'friend' of his who asked in passing why the internet wasn't working.  They took out the On-Call Blackberry and showed that there were zero calls and messages last night.  The acting-supervisor 'forgot' his cellphone that day so they couldn't check his (I so wanted to call his cellphone in the middle of the meeting and watch him explain that away. He was one of those people who had their Blackberry attached at the hip). 

The 'Contracting Officer's Technical Representative' or COTR came in to the room and he was fuming. Asking me pointed questions

I couldn't get a word in edge wise

Nobody really said anything at first

My supervisor was told not to tell anyone what happened in that meeting after I left.  All he would say was that they were very lucky that charges were not brought up against them since the documents that they filled out with the false information was a government document and what they did was technically fraud against the U.S. government.  The only reason he told me this was because I had to help file an amendment to the incident report.

I defended with “there’s nothing wrong with her machine at all

Still brandishing Angie’s project document, skulking away towards the IT Cupboard to furnish HR Tank with a new OptiPlex. 

After enduring yet another hour-long session of unintelligent questions, I escaped her deskside with her old machine and yet another list of demands she felt inhibited her capacity to perform as she otherwise would. At the top of the list, she required a colour printer placed near her desk. I guess having to walk half way across the floor to the communal printer may have burned vital calories necessary to plug the real-estate offered by her 80-inch wide trousers. In reality, I was aware through the rumour mill that an apprentice she had appointed in the guise of being mentored in all manner of HR and Legal duties had left some weeks prior citing the need for an actual career. HR Tank had instead used her as a dogsbody to fetch printer output, deliver files to various unsuspecting recipients and, on the way back from such voyages, procure various canteen supplies for her.

This morning’s diversion of Angie’s insistence became all too clear. BHIT had finally gotten word of what had happened last night – most likely the tip off was my email sent to him just prior to my leaving which complained vehemently about Angie’s actions. It seemed he had grown an impromptu pair of balls and demanded Angie’s explanation via email – which of course Angie was all too eager to give! Remember, the handover of machines would no-longer be carried out at the conference; instead all machines would ship next week directly to their recipients. This lunacy has been given the eager thumbs up by all middle management who welcomed the fact that Angie would deliver the project apparently ahead of time.

Opening the PDF, “252 machines to be ordered from Dell”. The statement, rubber stamped by all and necessary, seemed to vindicate Angie completely. The ball, it seemed, had bounced clandestinely into my back yard. 

BHIT rushed to my desk. I knew what he was going to ask before he’d even asked it. Even though Roland, I let my true feelings known to BHIT. “So, you’re telling me there is one week to image 250 odd machines? So, in reality, that’s 50 machines per day?” BHIT nodded, hoping I would concede and provide some magical way out of this new found emergency. “This is stupid! Whoever planned this needs their ass handed to them!” 

My claim had now garnered the attention of the rest of ITS; no longer were their eyes transfixed on their screens, “The images are ready whenever you want them!” 

Angie returned to ITS and immediately interjected my exchange with Roland, Angie’s stern voice still sought to overshadow any offering of reality. 

Delving deep into her PDF, “I will not disrupt an entire conference just to give out laptops! It is better to present the face of IT by offering a support drop-in service as people need it instead of disrupting an entire event!”

There was no way we could now argue this round now. Angie had landed us in it. She had played her cards, my name made synonymous with total disaster! If I delivered 250 built laptops, Angie would get the glory and I would remain a nameless entity. For me, neutrality or bust! For Angie, glory or neutrality!

“I dunno how we’re going to do this…” I said rising from my chair. Leading the procession

I accepted my diminishing responsibility as I set about my regular duties, waiting to catch the moment when the Wi-Fi would drop. 

Just as the signal dropped, I simply assured him of my belief that the project was in capable hands… the first time I’ve ever flat out lied on the job. He disappeared back into the hustle and bustle of the office, leaving me to my WiFi investigation.

An oddly airy Wednesday afternoon surged into view. ITS felt clean and clear. We could at long last breathe a hearty sigh of relief. Angie and Roland had disappeared off for what seemed like ages. The absence of their black auras had left a dramatically spacey vibe, various coffee recipes and deeply particular insights of certain male employees that these aging, portly women found attractive made for a percussive din, the only moments of reprieve as Angie’s led her Menopause group for their twice-daily Starbucks fix. Of course, she would leave Roland on guard-dog duty!

Still, but just loud enough so to ensure BHIT was in earshot. He barely flinched while I concluded my full update to QBG. In one way, I didn’t care who heard me anymore, so long as BHIT did. But it felt good to get listened to, as if my account needed to be heard by someone. “There’s only a month to go… shouldn’t something more be happening by now?”

As the week trundled towards its closure, through as an agreeable manner as I could muster. Roland refused to ask for help, but in reality, I think I was happier without having to endure this pair’s attitude and negative manner. My working life seemed basic and simple again, just the way I like it. Well, of course with the regular admonishments of Angie! Morale was long gone, but there were our own little private worlds to disappear of to.

The biggest casualty was the Ghost server that MAFG and I had acquired, like a hostage whose captivity had broken them down, sympathising with their kidnapper and taking on a new persona to mirror the evil twisted nature of its jailer. The beige box was coated in the alienesque slime and goo that oozed from Roland’s skin, like Spiderman’s evil doppelganger shooting acidic goo from his palms. The Dymo label which had so proudly identified the Ghost Server by its hostname, “ITSGHO01” had been forcibly removed as if to eviscerate some evidence of its history. It left a white rectangle, obvious against its discoloured skin, with scratches and scrapes surrounding it akin to an animal’s claws. 

Two weeks passed by, its casing battered and bent. However, luckily, an entire motherboard and CPU remained. It was this we were transplanting to the distressed research machine, its rare and irreplaceable exclusivity commanding the utmost care and attention. The anti-static wrist bands seemed to complicate the procedure as its plastic-coated coil snagged on various parts of the metal chassis. We were happily bonding in our moment of isolation, catching up on each other’s hearsay; it had been the first time I had been able to relax with someone at work for a while, QBG it seemed could make a suitable replacement for MAFG!

Our mother’s meeting was almost at a close when our a stony faced Facilities monkey, his frame slightly obscuring the overhead lighting. His accent clearly demonstrated the fact that he was far from home, like a lone warrior holding his own in some foreign land. “Right here I guess, there’s some space at the back!” I said, motioning to an isle MAFG had previously emptied towards the end of his tenure. His told-you-so smile accompanied the shake of his head, “What, all of em? You know there’s about 250 of the things?”

Convoyed to the scene of the crime, adorned with the familiar Dell logos, as a team of Facilities workers scrambled to unload them. “You better figure out where we’re going to put these double quick” he commanded, thrusting a manifest into my hands. I could see my name planted firmly at the top of the document’s recipient list. I knew right then that my evening had just been squandered by whoever’s administrative oversight had caused this turn of events. Of course, I knew full well it had to be only one person’s doing!

The lobby of the building was decorated with an oversized clock face which hung above the main security desk. Its appearance had a stealthy corporate double-meaning. On the one hand, their arrival time electronically indelibly stamped on their permanent record as they would swipe their access cards. To add to this crafty corporate purpose, this oversized clock always seemed to be a few indistinct minutes faster than almost any other clock that existed.  

Tonight, finally leaving the building at 9pm.

My disentanglement from the project, I’m sure, had made it into Angie’s rewrite of my project plan in verbatim. I know I had even seen it. What’s more, with only two weeks to go, building 250 machines in that time was no mean feat! What had Roland even been doing this whole time? This blunder, which felt a little too obvious, seemed to signify stage two of Angie’s sabotage.

1364250219.0,1b03d2,The B**** Manager from Hell Pt21: The Rollout from Hell,jon6,4988,3106,677,"QBG and I worked long and worked hard. Machines were building while machines were unwrapped while machines were repacked - this time with larger address labels as per Angie’s demands. The previously arid air infected by Roland seemed more pleasant now that Angie had declared he had ""far more pressing duties to attend to"". That didn't stop Angie's persistence in micromanagement. Each visit brought a new list of vices which had to be adhered to; her elephant-like memory seemed to retain every minor piece of misdirection she spluttered

QBG and I pulled overtime on Wednesday/Thursday. Our thanks came with a company-sanctioned pizza on one night, several cardboard cups which once contained cheap, cost effective canteen coffee and shreds of ill-cut tape and inners littered the floor. I sat on the trolley, gently rocked myself back and forth, thoroughly shattered as QBG lounged on the chair. Our hands were grubby from the manual lifting, but we were finally done. 

We still had no idea if our plea for clemency from BHIT was the real reason for Roland’s absence, echoing through the lifeless corridor as the electronic lock whizzed, sealing the cupboard with a tomb-like finality.

As I pushed the trolley towards the mail room, yet seemed to be yet another construct of some great demonstration of incompetence. We had no real idea of what we were expected to do there and we still had another 50 machines to image as reps waited. QBG and I had also realized that our unanticipated team-building time had come to an end; a valuable insight we would have never gotten had Angie not interfered in the way that she did. But mired with her constant micromanagement, we were glad it was all over - for now.

Another Monday morning! The rain and sleet smacked my windscreen as I could only think of the same old mantra

When I arrived, had met her disapproval in some way. Her shrill, demanding voice was evident even over the noise of the waiters and waitresses igniting several water heaters in anticipation for the impending delegates. Angie’s constant barking continued up until our official open time of 10:00am at which time she scarpered to make-nice with some apparent acquaintances. It always amazed me to see her personality and body language shift so seamlessly when interacting with anyone who wasn’t, well, us!

Almost as soon as the hall opened, he stressed with a clear but jovial tenor voice that he had received it the previous week but was having problems with it.

I ushered him into the back of our support area. Our IT setup seemed to impress him. The Ghost Server hummed proudly atop a stack of plastic boxes while stations demarked with chairs and table space offered spare network cables and power supplies already connected and waiting for their prospective tenants. “It’s like mission control in here!” the delegate quipped. With a confirmatory laugh

The delegate presented his laptop. As I hooked it up, bits of paper and bound by a rubber band from the depths of his suit. Peering through the frames of his rounded spectacles, he declared that he had a number of problems. He reeled off each entry on his list, as though sermonising from his blue notebook. The software, though it could open, was unable to load profiles or remember preferences which, though meant nothing to me, I had also noticed McAfee was failing to update and the image distinctly lacked any installation of MS Office.

The realization that Roland had indeed fudged the image was all too real. This was polarized by the sight near the helpdesk tables at 10:15. The queue seemed to extend to the far corner of the hall, came to voice their ails.

Tensions ran high as the word spread among the queuing reps. IT had blown it; they’d screwed the pooch and messed up big-time! Dissent spread quickly into the queue. Our borrowed Helpdesk guy was buckling. He was ill-equipped to deal with demand of this magnitude without the simple escape route of simply logging a call for escalation. I relieved him with the instruction to find Angie. In the meantime

The rear support area filled as some 200 machines lay piled as portrait of the enormous blunder. Angie’s eventual reappearance was complemented with another bout of her ranting and raving; despite her inability to offer another solution

Our borrowed helpdesk guy and I loaded the laptops into a hire van for their voyage back to the office. Our drive back to the office through the rain seemed dark and depressing. The rain reverberated off the large metal hulk of the van only dampened by the cloth of the soft laptop bags. The only thing to look forward to now was another drenching skirmish through the office yard to return the laptops to their holding cells.

1363728968.0,1ambp1,The B**** Manager from Hell Pt3: The IT Induction from hell,jon6,4037,2204,58,"It's Monday morning. I am in early to set up a bunch of noobies with their fancy corporate gear. I'm usually very prepared and have kit ready to go by Thursday evening/Friday morning at latest. However

I'm literally imaging the final machine when my induction group enters the room. I've had no time for tea or coffee

Still, the air is about to darken. The familiar stench of putrid an old woman with too much perfume enters the room. She walks straight to the back of the training room and takes her seat next to a young woman. Out of the corner of my eye, I see the young woman attempt small talk to no avail.

I get started and I'm giving a brief introduction to the Company IT. I can't help be but distracted by the icy stare of BMFH piercing me like a lazer. As I duly hand out prescribed equipment to my delegates, it's a little like Christmas morning.

In my haste to get my late-attendees set up, BMFH hops to her feet to investigate the situation. Holding the end of the offending charger and staring at me, she silences the room with an authorative ""Well?"" Before even being able to offer either explination or promises to make amends, she takes phone and charger from noobie and walks for the door, with ""Come with me!""

After a solid dressing down, I oblige, kitted with charger and wave goodbye to my lovingly customised toy of awesome.

We re-enter the room; like a freshly scolded schoolby

Endeavouring to continue the induction

We make it to 12

Yeah... BMFH has other ideas. We break for lunch. I'm making pleasant small talk with some of the noobies - a standard tactic in making them feel ""comfortable"" with support. The queue for the coffee jug disipates and I walk with one of the noobies to go get myself some salvation in a cup. Just as I pick the cup up

She starts with stating how lunch is for the delegates only; though no it's not! It's been SOP for god knows how long to have a working lunch with the new delegates to chinwag, whatever. However, new policy as of right now, I need to return to my desk where BMFH will watch me complete some meandering tasks she has for me. My co-workers are initially confused by my presence when I should be in induction, but on seeing the red-faced snaggletoothed hellhound, quickly understand.

She insists we look at the queues... well

For one glorious moment

Back upstairs

Still no coffee.

Maintaining my professional demeanour against all odds, password lengths, etc. Read it good luck"".

After the delegates have left, Monday morning, no coffee, she's on her fourth cup, I react! I just said ""Firstly, it would have gone a lot easier if you hadn't had landed me with four delegates I wasn't expecting needing me to run around and scour kit up from somewhere. Secondly, this is not indicative of how inductions are usually run at all! And I resent your opinion that the support department is a joke"".

Oh... no... you... dit'int....

She exits with a calm and collected look... yea OK... I know it... I'm fkd now. 

And where is my damned coffee!?!?

**The Coffee** I ran into Mr. SureI'llBringYouACoffee no good lying git co-worker who I thought had my back. I just said

My sentence was cut short when he gave me a complete insight into the morning's proceedings. After helping me haul ass scrambling some extra kit together

BUT... unbeknownst to him, this was where she had learned of the IT Induction. In between dressing down my colleague for God-knows what and observed him as he duly tipped away my lovely coffee and placed my mug directly into the dishwasher, she had decided that she had to be a part of this induction.

1364338117.0,1b2mf7,The B**** Manager from Hell Pt24: FAQ,jon6,4096,2274,473,"**So
Yes. This is an as-accurate as I remember account of a bitch manager from hell that I endured over a 15 month period. The story indicates a much shorter timeline, cost a few people their jobs and was an overbearing terrible person. All of this led to her ultimate, er, promotion…

**How many parts are there going to be?**
To be honest, I just wrote more. In truth, Angie was such a nightmare that if I took to time to recount every single thing she did, there would have been near on 500 parts! At some point, given I have other commitments to adhere to, this needed to end sadly. I decided to steer my writing towards the ultimate conclusion of Angie’s reign. 

**Are you a writer?**
Nope. Not professionally. I’ve never felt compelled to sit down and write anything this novelistic before. I’ve been writing lyrics for years and used to trying to fit syllables to beats

**I suspect he is in reality
Yep… sorry about that :)

**Why didn’t you just quit?**
It had been my third IT Support role. In reality, as I managed to prove to myself when I did change jobs, moving from one dead-end support role to another resolves nothing. It’s just the same thing, different place!

**...go to her boss? Explain how she's impacting negatively on productivity
There is such a thing as crapping in your own back yard. No upper manager wants to be bothered by some troublemaking runt from some low-end support role going on about how much he hates his boss! It’s a fast track out the door

**The BBC should just go ahead and turn these into a show.**
Hahaha

**I would have flipped my desk and said ""f*ck it
I was brought up to be very patient. But, I couldn’t be that flippant about it. 

** I don't understand why the entire department doesn't walk out. That would get the attention of Angie's superiors.**
This is a rather Hollywood ending, we were all jobhunting, though!


** 3 seconds!**
Do I owe you a new spring for your F5 key?

**I love you
Awww

**If this series ends up with a tree-fiddy joke i'll be both angry and impressed**
You don’t know how tempting this was to put up - even for just five minutes! Though I hope it didn’t end that way for you!

**So, correct?**
It’s safe to say I was about 22-23


**How does it feel to have so many people hanging on your every word jon6?**
Odd! But I'm pleased I provided such entertainment - and I hope I didn't get anyone in trouble with their bosses!

**I feel like Chelle at the beginning of Portal 2. All that hard work, and you'll have to deal with her all over again.**
Luckily I never crossed paths with her at all after that. But it’s the one big lesson of the corporate world. Credit travels up

**Guys... guys. We got to the end. We did it.**
We sure did… my large diversion from doing coursework has also suffered… I’m envisaging a very hard Easter weekend ahead to catch up. But I’ve enjoyed writing for you guys!


**Misogyny loses my sympathy**
I would hate to be thought of as someone who hates women. For one

Joking aside, my brief description of “quiet blonde girl” should be enough for you to paint your own picture. 

However, I felt that to not describe their mannerisms and neurosis would have done them an injustice. Similarly, Roland’s rat-like appearance just seemed to burn anyone who set eyes on him. BHIT, I think, was also subject to rather unrelenting description. I’ve had some excellent female colleagues, managers and so forth so I would hate for it to be assumed I have a problem with women in power. Apologies if you thought otherwise!

1363736230.0,1amlsr,The B**** Manager from Hell Pt4: Undercurrents,jon6,4110,2296,50,"I arrived for work the next day

I arrived to find a deathly quiet IT department. Sadly

I was surprised to hear a new type of noise from Angie's direction. Rather than the snarling voice of Satan demolishing yet another soul or the heavy bleak silence that accompanied her stare

See, some middle manager in a fit of synergetic genius decided to implement an entirely open-office strategy and had all walls removed. As far as I can see, it served to merely underpin the adage of ""good fences make good neighbours"" and that destroying the efficiency of Aircon in the height of summer only adds to tensions.

Finance had repeatedly become irritated with ITS occasionally ""walking through their area"" as they would usually have varying currencies hanging around for traveling business reps - it seemed walking even near their area was suddenly deemed a security risk - and were constantly angered by the fact we had a lot of foot traffic and a lot of equipment which invariably made its way to us. Really - IT Support does not suit open office

Suffice it to say, filing systems and new layouts meaning we had to constantly move and shrink). Simiarly, they had enforced a three-piece rule, whereby you could only have three pieces of equipment on your desk at any time. As the average monitor and system unit accounted for two of these, you can imagine what a struggle this was should anyone show up with a non functioning laptop and accompanying projector/home router/printer. 

Our constant commandering of any post-room space and the need to create a PC-den in the stock cupboard was a testament to what a poor relation IT Support really was in the company. Though our jobs were now more difficult

Nevertheless

Finally. The coast was clear - we could take a breath. Being the last one in, the storm of the BMFH's reign was upon us! 

Angie had decided that during the course of the day

Middle-Aged Family Guy (MAFG) was on the early shift. He had obviously already been the meat grinder, it went that well then?

MAFG wasn't a slacker, but he wasn't one. And it looked like the wind had been knocked well and truly out of his sales. 

He began to tell us how Angie had spun her web. She had a printed list of his open tickets and several examples of his closed tickets. She had initially allowed him to dig his grave so it seems with a few innocent cases

That's when it hit me. As he talked about the meeting

There is a mole... that's all there is to it... someone here is working against us all. Someone had to have provided Angie with a method of retrieving closed tickets. Someone has to have shown her how to use the printer. The cloud of suspicion was very much there. I knew it... and I could sense

After our team post-mortem of Angie's impact to date, tickets review at 13:30..... right at the start of my designated rota'd lunch break...

OK Angie... you foul smelling b****... it's on...

So I'm sitting there wrapping up a ticket and I hear him catch a call.  He reads the script for our crazy client (No exceptions) and starts troubleshooting with the caller.  

I hear him go through the steps and he decides he has to escalate the ticket.  He tells the caller that given the holiday weekend

I stand up and I look at him, I've been in Iraq and Afganistan.  I've had people trying to kill me every day for the past six years.

I hang up the phone, so everything goes to standard output, ie the system.log.  My mistake, under pressure, plus I thought no way a high school kid knows Unix.   I find this out, fix the script, redirect all output to /dev/null and the password in the script stops getting logged.  So, no problem I am going to send a command out to wipe the system.log file and clean up my mess.  Since to change the password I had to set a password in a script.  This was back in like 2008


During this small window some kid had been sifting through the console looking at every single log file.  Somehow, I start doing detective work and use a dummy receipt system.  Basically look for a file or string that exists and if it does, touch another file to ""stamp it"" with a dummy receipt, and then build a database of machines based on that file to see what accounts have been promoted to admin accounts.   Sure enough this one student's user account was synchronized to a lot of Macs and sure enough his account was always being promoted to admin.


I gathered my evidence, I asked him if he pulled the password form the log, he said yes.  I asked him if he had ever used Unix before, he said no it was just figuring it out on the fly.  I told him I wasn't going to turn him in, and that I will just forget the incident ever happened.  He asked me why and I said you're too smart to get expelled or suspended.  However, you need to take your brain and use it constructively.  What do you want to learn the most on the computer?  He said he wanted to start a programming club and develop games in Python.  Next week I rolled down to the storage facility and grabbed a Compaq dual XEON server, with a RAID 5 controller and 3 hard disks in it and like 4 or 8gigs of RAM.  It was one of those spend your budget money or lose it deal (government, and those servers had been collecting dust.   They had no OS on it.

I come into his building with the server on a flat bed.  I said here is your development server.  Here are the rules.  You cannot plug this into our network, he replied.  Second rule, this server has no OS on it, so you must choose what OS you want to put on it, and you have to support it yourself.  You cannot call help desk for help, and it has to be legit, either open source or someone buy's an actual license.  I understand


2 years later the kid graduates and gets a full ride to Boston College.  he also wrote the advanced math curriculum his senior year.  He did a bunch of stuff in Python and LaTeX.  


Oh I also turned him into my mole.  Every time some kid talked about hacking he would email me and tell me what they were trying to do.   I haven't talked to him since, which may have damaged his chances at a full scholarship.  Mind you, I was working for an impoverished school district, a lot of families in that district were below poverty level.  


EDIT - fixed formatting


Sometimes it is good not being the iron fist ruling


EDIT #2


Several of you have expressed interest in the fact it was an impoverished school district and they all got laptops.  Let me explain to you how budgeting works in public education.  The state you live in sets a budget, you get X amount of dollars every year.  Now, additionally you can get federal money as well on top of state money.  The budget is then broken down into categories.  You have budget for staff, which covers their wages, benefits, and so forth.  Capital Outlay is the part of the budget you spend on technology, desks, and so forth.  It cannot be used for salary, and allows schools access to technologies through this program.   


The school I worked for, since you must also pay for keyboards, mice, and monitors, and they require more power.  A laptop is 1 plug.   The school was about 60 buildings and 30,000 students.  The laptop program was at the high school level only, which was 6


You have to realize a lot of these kids never even ate their first meal for that day until they came to school.  I grew up lower middle class and I thought I had missed out on certain things in life, or cruises, we at least got to go to the lake for vacation.  These kids have nothing.  It taught me how privileged I was.  Giving them a laptop is awesome.  Sure, some kids will squander their opportunities and not care, sure some will just get by and not take full advantage of it, but some kids will put it to good use and get full scholarships to good colleges and come out on top.   That right there makes it completely worth it.


**EDIT #3**


It is possible the kid read this post.  I am not going to say who my employer was


**UPDATE**

The student in question has in fact found this thread, or the schools name for anonymity reasons.  I think it is best kept that way.  He also reminded me of a few other exploits the students found and used which I forgot about.   The ARD Agent bug (Apple's fault) which allowed you to run apple script with escalated privileges, ie sudo.   Then we had a package that had a self healing auto update, and I had to have one folder in that package writable (bad developer) and we managed application usage by file path.  So, once students figured out they could drop games in this folder they did.   To remedy this I switched off the write bit in POSIX and then just download and repacked the whole package manually every time an update came out and just redeployed said package.


I'll have to admit I was impressed by how adaptive and smart a few of the students were.    They made me pay for my mistakes.  Plus

**Background**: I'm still in college.  My soon to be husband is graduating ahead of me, and while I've never been IT, it was what everyone called me.

I freelance in social media marketing to help put myself through school, but can really be getting into a younger market with a little bit of help.  I have a rate that turns out at about $15-$20/hr, depending on how much of my help they need.  Because I work in a lot of really teeny businesses, I often help the owners fix computers and set up their phones on the side.  I'm very accustomed to genuinely confused clients and bosses.

Today, and there had been no red flags up to this point.

I'd actually become rather close with a specific guy, and his personal email address.

The person on the other end for the interview was significantly older than anyone else I'd dealt with.  He sounded like a late 50's smoker who would have been better suited for a manufacturing plant.  He starts giving me scenarios, how you would respond to that?""  Every time, after the second sentence of my response, he cuts me off, saying, ""Ok, that's enough

After about 20 minutes of this, would always clear his internet history.  You don't do that do you?  Because only liars do that.""

I spent a couple of seconds in complete silence, I do know a good bit about networking setups.  What seems to be the issue?""

He then details how he tried to install this browser tracking and keylogging software on the network

I also helped him install a wireless mouse.

Now

By now

I got off the phone, a keylogger as well as some other random software installed that dumped everything he'd done during the entire day into a file on his boss's PC.

He told me he'd call me back.  He had to call a lawyer

He called me back later

The owner had died a year or so ago

**tl;dr - Big Brother is revealed in a phone interview

**edit** Just got a text again from Geoff.  Though he didn't give me any information on how his boss was doing it, including the person on the other end.  There had also been some discrepancies with pay, with half an hour being taken off somehow, or being made to work an hour longer.

1375020552.0,1j7rcf,The only time I lied to a client,paracelsus23,2309,606,314,"Many of the tales on this subreddit are stories of the frustration of clueless users

I had several clients I supported long-term, they understood the value of preventative maintenance, taking care of equipment, and the IT itself was typically pretty low-stress. Some of the employees would request my services for their personal computers, which is how this story starts. 

I'm at one of my best clients, approaches me. I've known him for years, and even met his family at a few company functions. He has a few daughters, and a son - all in their 30's and 40's. Here's how the conversation went:

* ""My son has recently passed away
* ""Sir
* ""When going through my son's estate, has a significant portion of his assets going to his best friend, and not to anyone in the family. We found some files on his laptop we can't open, and thought they might have some clues as to why he made this decision - maybe a journal or something. We always thought we were close with him and are really perplexed as to why he'd disinherit us. The friend seems just as surprised"". 
* ""Sure, etc). 
* ""No problem - whatever you can do""

So, I see in C:\Program Files\ are the files in question. Archive1.RAR, Archive2.RAR, etc, through about 7 or 8. Someone had obviously been doing some digging - who the hell checks program files for RAR files? Anyway, they vary in size, from say 2GB to 5GB. Try to open them up - and of course, I figure I'll have this job done in 5 minutes or less. 

I grab some random RAR password decryptor, but there's a little bit of light bondage and watersports. No journals, personal files, or anything else - just porn. As I work my way through archives 4 and 5, I realize that the file names are all now ""John and I doing X"" - not the names you'd see from a porn site. Great. 

So, and for whatever personal reasons, the son / boyfriend don't feel comfortable coming out to the guy's father, even in death. Now's probably a good time to mention that I'm only 19 at the time, and that I also happen to be bisexual (I was completely in the closet at the time, I still am to my family). So now, instead of dealing with a simple file recovery, or outing a dead son and boyfriend - with photographic evidence. Fuck. I decided I'd pull the laptop's drive

I thought about it for a while, and that it wasn't my place to disclose it. However, this still left me in a tricky situation with the father. I couldn't tell him, ""Sorry, I wasn't able to open the files"", because he'd simply find someone else who could, and might not be as discreet as me. Somewhere down the line, and the father would know the homegrown porn existed. No

I pick up the phone: 

* ""Hello
* ""REALLY?!? Did you find anything? A journal
* ""No, but they can contain viruses and be dangerous to the computer, so you'd want to keep them protected. I'd suggest deleting them, or at least not trying to open them"". 
* ""Ah, Paracelsus?""
* ""No, just in case there was something in another location. I didn't really find any personal files at all"".
* ""Wow
* ""Oh, and for your loss.""

1364336478.0,1b2k7r,The B**** Manager from Hell Pt23: Epilogue,jon6,3985,2312,393,"Weeks came and went; another month slipped by unnoticed. A new support manager had appeared. Young, thankfully

I had two major projects after Angie’s departure. I was in the midst of successfully redeploying the laptops complete with fully working software. However, login scripts which went nowhere and more phantom accounts and objects than I think we would ever finally sort out. It was if Angie had left me a parting gift, a final “fuck you” from the Queen of Aggression. It’s two-pronged effect seemed unintentional given her ineptitude. But it had encroached on every single user in the company as their login times grew exponentially, together with seemingly random permission sets which denied sometimes even the most basic of privileges.

It was getting to be the hottest summer I’ve ever known in Britain. I still hadn’t taken time out to wash my Mondeo; it’s recent costly repair bill had left a bitter taste in my mouth. The grime that lay affixed to the bonnet and wings seemed an apt punishment for depriving me of yet another wage check. 

Arriving back to the office from a well-earned summer pub lunch, its black finish shone in the midday sun, freshly polished and lovingly detailed. Its congeniality seemed marred by the fact that Angie had once owned a car like this, her angry face refusing to even make eye contact as she stared over the leather steering wheel. 

I had finished replacing a dead hard disk in an OptiPlex and was delivering it to a damsel in distress. Particularly, your ex manager is back” he grimaced. I knew what he meant; this man had been trained to smile and lie for a living. The news that Angie was back seemed unpalatable. 

“Who

The Sales Manager shook his head with a learned look. “People like that don’t get sacked!” he explained. I hung on his every word, Jon6! If she had done well, the person who recommended her would have gotten a nice pat on the back. But, if she cocks it up, there’s no way they’re going to turf her out. Whoever recommended her would have their nuts in a sling for recommending such a dud; nobody would ever take them seriously ever again”

He continued “When people like that in such positions of power make a fantastic fuck up like that

Despising the obvious truth to his words

“Well

I looked up from over the desk partition. Across the cavernous office, over the sound of printers, phones and chatter. Another hapless team of underlings were getting it from her, both barrels. 

I turned

As the OptiPlex spun into life, I was interrupted by the returning damsel. She thanked me for my time turning back to her work, our brief moment of temporary friendship now at an end, politically and autocratically ceased with the completion of my task, the only remaining duty being the closing of the support ticket.

No calls had come through until about 9am

“I’ve been trying to print and nothing is appearing in the printer”

“Not a problem” I said

“You are not printing locally”

“I am sorry” he replied. 

“You are not printing to your local printer; it has been changed to a printer on the network”. 

I changed it back to the one on his desk

“Oh” he said and hung up really abruptly. I did not expect that type of rude behaviour from this guy but then he was a pretty high level person and they could get rude.

The next call I got was from this young secretary in one of our small offices. I did not get support calls from there very often since it was a small office with only 10 staff. This girl had started about a month before and this was her first job

“Hello

“Yes

“My printer has not stopped printing this morning.”

I was kind of expecting this call and so I told her not to worry and was about to say I knew where it was coming from when she interrupted me. 

“It won’t stop printing p-p-porn”

“It is pages and pages about men’s ‘things’ and their problems”. 

“I am sorry

“Men’s parts and them having difficulty with them”. She explained. 

“Erectile Dysfunction?” I asked. 

“I am not explaining this any more!” 

“There are pictures!”

“We have been hacked””. She yelled at me in quick succession.  

I calmed her down and told that I had stopped the printouts and that we would not be ‘hacked’ again. 

I guess the fellow in the other city had been trying to print out suggested solutions to his problem from various medical websites and when the first printout had not appeared

The secretary left a short while later

EDIT: Wow - Front page - Thanks. 

He was not in a medical profession. This stuff was strictly personal. He came in on a holiday to surreptitiously print information of a sensitive nature and read it later. This was back when folks did not have home broadband. 

I think that he had probably been set up to print to the remote office and then forgot about it (until he remembered). I never chased it up and found out if the local support guys had done this for him. I thought the fellow had suffered enough. The offices were on opposite sides of the country (roughly 50 miles apart). 

The lass had left after this but I think other things were also affecting it. She was pretty sensitive and did not handle being in a busy office well. Closeted schoolgirl to frontline support staff in a busy office is tough for most folks. This probably did not help. 

I have no idea what the pictures showed. Use your imagination.

Me: thank you. (I proceed to look up her I.D number and find that she was a student that hasn't enrolled in classes in about 3 years) ok ma'am


Angry: (voice suddenly filled with rage and ignorance) I am too a student here! I need office for some classes that I'm taking over at (other school not related to us at all) and I **demand** the cheaper price. That shit is too expensive to buy regular.


Me: are you currently enrolled in classes here at (university)? 


Angry: No


Me: ma'am if you're not taking classes


Angry: I am too! I just had to take some time off because of illness! (She then proceeds to tell me about her ""illness"" and how she still deserves her discount software and)


Me: I'm very sorry


Angry: can you just let me use your student number and order it for me?


Me: no ma'am


Angry: Are you new there? I can't wait till they train yo worthless ass.


Me: ma'm


Angry: You're not helping me anyway! I can't believe how fucking stupid you is! Get me my software


Me: no ma'm

A few minutes go by and the phone rings again and on the caller ID it shows her number. So I go and get my manager and ask if he would handle this irate woman.


Manager: thank you for calling IT support


Angry: I just called a few minutes ago


Manager: I'm very sorry for that

Manager then goes through the whole process of getting her number and telling her she's not a student and doesn't get her discount. 


Angry: is there anyone there with more experience who knows what they're doing!?


Manager: ma'm


Angry: fuck you!


Manager: (in the calmest cool voice) no bitch


I have never felt more defended and cared for as an employee since that day. I later found out that she did call a few days later that she did call again and convinced one of the other techs to use his ID for her. Manager was listening to the call so he got fired and Mrs.Angry got blacklisted and reported to judicial affairs.

It was announced again last week, before the change actually occurred. There's been a lot of ""Why is the internet down?"" and ""My username's broken!"" and a whole bunch of ""Why doesn't it just work? Why do I have to do anything? It worked yesterday. This is too hard!"" coming from people who didn't read the email announcements, or the ""Status"" or ""News"" sections on the intranet site, or even the notice that we stuck up outside the department hoping that people might read it before coming in here... which is causing a certain degree of homicidal feeling among the support team, but this one, this one user...

to: help@company; support@company; [linemanager]@company; [local-office-drone]@company; [it-team-member-1]@company; [it-team-member-2]@company;  [it-team-member-3]@company ...

It went on like that. As far as I can see she just emailed every address she's ever corresponded with. 

subject: wireless down

&gt;""The wireless is down.""

Then a whole bunch of ""reply to all"" happened, and it took a couple of hours to prune everyone who had nothing to do with this out of the conversation. Once the shouting had shut up we managed to get a reply back explaining that the wifi was not down, and that she needed to log in using her usename and password now, along with detailed instructions as to how. Also, a fairly stern warning about sending out bulk mail and why it was causing everyone such a pain in the ass. 

What did we get back? 

from: [idiot]@company
to: help@company; support@company; [linemanager]@company; [local-office-drone]@company; [it-team-member-1]@company; [it-team-member-2]@company;  [it-team-member-3]@company ... (etc)

subject: Ok. 

&gt;""The wireless is still down.""

aaaaaand the reply to all happened again. 

Whilst we were trying to quieten everyone down we got another

&gt;""I tried the password.""

then another...

&gt;""It didn't work.""

then another... 

&gt;""I tried my username too. Is that the password?""

and another...

&gt;""What's the password?""

Each time CC'd to what appears to be her entire address book

To try and stem the tide we sent one of the helldesk to her office to talk to her in person... she wasn't there. Whilst hunting for her more emails kept coming in. 

&gt;""I thought my password might be wrong.""

&gt;""My password is [password]... is that right?""

**headdesk**

&gt;""I tried [otherpassword]

**double headdesk**

&gt;""I changed my password to [newpassword]. That doesn't work either.""

I had this image of someone sitting there just typing whatever came into their head into their email client and hitting ""Send to all"" once every few seconds, then where the hell is she sending these emails from? I was composing a message to that effect when I got this final one:

A story where styles of management and tech support collide.

Let's call this coworker ""Tim"". Many years ago at a company far

Tim was working for a U.S. defense firm. As you may expect, the test fails and fails hard. In the beginning, it's not even clear if it's an issue with the computerized test equiment, or the Unit Under Test [""UUT""]. God help you if your test equipment fried a perfectly good UUT -- the Pope will refer you to St Jude before running like Hell.

So there's a tight schedule and all testing is halted because of this failure. Managers are sweating. Senior managers are sweating. Directors and VPs are sweating. The customer pays a call to say 'hello' in person. For defense firms

It falls to Tim to be the man on the spot. ""Hey, it turns out the test equipment is buggered but the UUT is fine. The fix will take roughly 20-40 minutes.

... except that all these managers, and the customer are huddled together 30 feet way ""to facilitate"". We know how some managers are when it comes to facilitating via being physically present in the room. Every few minutes, one of these folks would break away from the group, meander over to Tim, and ask some version of, ""So, how's it going?"" or ""What's your status?"" or ""How close are you to being finished?"". Every... few... minutes. A 20-40 minute job quickly starts to extend into forever.

Tim's direct manager walks in. I mean

Bob takes one look at the group of Big Wigs

Bob: ""Tim

Tim: ""Well Bob, but they keep coming over one by one and interrupting me.""

Bob spins on the balls of his feet and jabs his finger up in the air. ""Everybody OUT!!!""

After a few minutes of cat-herding and political massaging, the word spreads faster than bad news, and testing can resume.

Forever after

This company is quite old, especially higher up.

When I get around to doing one of the CEO's computers.. I was in for it. He must have been between 70 and 90 years old. He looked like a goblin. A short, and whiter, and had big, thick glasses with round black rims.

This particular man had two computers in his office. The work one, windows 98. And it was dead. Almost as dead as he should have been.

He asks me if I can make his brand new computer look like his old one. 

Being one of the CEOs, and invent division by null if he so requested it. And so I went about the quest to make windows 7 look and sound like windows 98.

I take his ancient Time Lord device and try to turn it on initally. 

The power supply doesn't work

I dont' know very much about dos. I ask the old guy and he asks me to show him. Be punches in some crazy string of characters and juju witchcraft and windows begins to boot.

What?

How did this statue .. KNOW to do this?! Is he a timelord?!

Anyway, DaVinci, and.. SimCity. What?!?

It is no simple matter to just copy the theme files over from 98 to 7. The computer doesn't have a USB port, and even if they did, I wouldn't be able to turn off the system to access them (As I found one legacy server we have runs PCDOS and has had zero downtime in the past four years.. )

So

So I find an AOL version that works under 98

So I go about download AOL for windows 98

I put winrar on a floppy

I rar up the CD and put it on a floppy about two dozen times

I extract it

I instal AOL on the machine

I try to find a phone wire... oh

WAIT WHY AM I USING DIALUP INTERNET IF I CAN JUST PUT THEM ON A FLOPPY

Seriously

So I put them on a floppy, and then onto a windows 7 machine! yay!

But some things don't work right. So I spent the better part of the week fine-tuning all four of the themes. Copied over all of the wavs, afterall.


When everything is said and done

They are both ATX, I add one of his clicky IDE disks into it for clicky, and present him a PC that looks like it was made in the mid-90s, running windows 7. 

The man was THRILLED. Not only because he has his childhood computer running

He said ""Remember that time you came back to the shop bleeding and muddy and said you didn't want to talk about it?  It's time to talk about it.""
 
It began innocently enough.  I received a call from one of the sales team about a new client who needed an initial assessment of their network and PCs.  This was a new(ish) Japanese restaurant in a declining part of town.  This restaurant was the only business still afloat in a much larger building that once held a movie theater and some sort of shipping warehouse.  I walked in
 
As I got down to business I was informed all the previous tech work was done by the next door neighbor's son.  I took this to mean ""We're used to paying $10 and a plate of chicken and rice for tech support.""  I was not surprised to find a lot of work to do, we're turning everything off and instead looking for what needs to be turned back on.  After this it was working better but still needed some deep cleaning or a reformat.  For some reason the internet was still dodgy. 
 
I pulled up a command prompt and did a continuous ping to Google.com and let that run for a few minutes.  When I came back I found high latency and lost of lost packets.  No big deal, but the teenager set them up with free internet.  Big Red Flag was raised.  This just got slightly interesting. 
 
I tried following the network cable but it disappeared into a hole in the floor.  Similar story in the back office with the accounting machine.  So I tried to log into the router and at least get an idea of what I was looking for.  I encountered the DD-WRT password prompt.  That's cool.  I prefer Tomato myself, can I call him?"" I asked.  ""No, he's gone off to college.  That's why we hired you."" 
 
A second later I'm standing in front of an open trap door in the floor behind the stock room, but for the most part you had about 6 feet to stand up.  It stunk like death and decay.  I found the two network cables and an extension cord and start off on my trek. 
 
Do you remember the Aliens movie (I forget which one) where the guy is following candles in the dark hallways and there are monsters stalking him.  This is what it felt like.  I tell myself that it can't be that far because extension cords are only so long.  At the end of the cord is another plugged into it, and another cable continues onwards.  My only hope of a 300 feet max was dashed. 
 
I had always thought I was the type to keep a cool head in an emergency.  I didn't think I was the type to panic.  Well, punch tool, and wire crimp and threw them at the eyes.  And then I ran, screaming like a little girl.  I must have hit my head in my disgraceful retreat because I ended up with a small cut and blood in my hair. 
 
I got back to the stepladder and found THEY HAD CLOSED THE DOOR!  What kind of monster would close somebody into a pit of alligators like that?  I threw it open and jumped out in a single leap.  I found myself face to face with the waitress who screamed.  I screamed back at her.  The owner rushed in and looked me over with great concern.  I managed to compose myself and said ""She startled me.  I think I bumped my head
 
So I am back in the hole retracing my steps.  I keep telling myself I'm not afraid
 
At the far wall I found the router.  Standard Linksys blue box zip tied to something holding it up.  And nothing else, I checked for open wireless signals of which there were two from establishments on the other side of the road.  So my best guess is the teenager had bridged the router to one of those open wireless connections and thus provided free internet for the restaurant.  I power cycled the device (which didn't help at all) and went back. 
 
I must have been a sight.  The owner quickly agreed with my suggestions and promised to call the local cable company come install their own internet tomorrow.  I was ushered out the back door without even a glass of water.  We kept that contract,,False,,t5_2sfg5,False,,True

The IT department, bought one of these modest sized monsters. Now this was a major purchase and had to approved by several people, including the Vice President of engineering, better known as “the mad Dutchman”. Now Dutch was the type of guy who added value to the organization by cutting costs, as opposed to generating new revenue. He was a bean counter extraordinaire. This purchase was no exception.
 
When purchasing one of these monsters the manufacturer would send you a quote listing out all the components and the price of each component. Dutch carefully perused many pages of the quote and started crossing out items he considered non-critical, hey we can reuse one in house, right?  And he crossed out cables to connect the CPU cabinet to the peripherals cabinet, cables to connect the peripherals cabinet to the disk drives, cables to connect everything else together. I mean, they’re just cables, we can have our hardware techs make our own cables right? Of course we can, we can do anything. And wow
 
So without having the Computer department do one final check on the items being ordered, the order goes out. And the manufacturer ships the equipment exactly as specified on the hacked up quote. And the equipment arrives and is placed in the computer room. And field service comes on site to do the installation.
 
But then field service starts asking questions, so everything will be delayed for another month or two while a new purchase order gets generated and approved to order the cables. Or so they think.
 
You see, a package that includes a $300,000 computer. There are no ordering numbers for these cables. There is no way to tell manufacturing, hey, just send us a few parts. No one can figure out how to sell us these parts and just these parts. (And no, doing a mirror of the quote with all the delivered parts crossed out isn't going to work). 

So the computer sat in the computer room, one week is 40 hours, there were about 25 engineers who were going to use the machine, and figure that back then one engineering man hour was worth about $50. So about $1,300,000 lost man hours. Plus a $300,000 paperweight. 

Maybe I should have called this ""Cables? We don't need no stinking cables.""

Our company employs a team of third shift workers to pull product for trucks that depart in the morning.  Most of these employees have been with the company for over ten years and are mostly all over the age of fifty.  They're all good guys, so all websites are open for browsing.  Our CEO's thoughts are that if we hire someone we expect them to be adult enough to know when it's appropriate to browse websites for personal use and when not to, and what sites are appropriate to begin with...which is okay for people who legitimately aren't going to download the worst viruses imaginable on accident but I digress. 

One employee in particular

Well, and then figure it's probably because the computers in the warehouse have no default email client, they all use web based email because so many people share the computers out there.  So I tell him that if he just copies and pastes the email address that will work, *or* **he can just type it by hand**.  Which is what I believe he did because...

...The next morning I walk into work and begin searching through email logs.  We have a queue of bad emails that couldn't be delivered for one reason or another and more often than not it's because someone sent an email to the wrong address by mistyping a letter or some such thing.  So was the trouble with poor Stew.  You see, what this 55 year old man wanted to do to this supposedly 22 year old busty blonde college girl.

I was doing a contract for a major national public sector organisation. Obviously no names, pay em till they get bored, throw them the BS tasks kind of role. Anyway, one day, myself and another contractor were set the task of a machine hunt. Basically the network was a hodge-podge of bolted on spokes using various standards, practically held together with poor soldering and bits of gaffa tape. However, there were a list of umpteen Windows 9x machines which were apparently alive on the user subnets which needed reimaging to XP or replacing. Our job was to do the pre-project hunt to determine who was using them and where they were. I say pre-project,000 shipment from Dell literally get delivered outside their offices

Anyway, now to talk to the user. The user was a guy who wore a grey suit, impeccably turned out but who looked like he was about to wet himself with fear. He asked us several times who we were, what we wanted, what for, where was this information going, etc. After placating him as much as possible that it was just an upgrade programme and we were IT Support

It just so happened

A few days later, hovers, glances at us and then makes for the door. Of course now we're talking about him, like WTF!? He makes an about turn at the door and comes up to us; he nervously asks ""Are you definitely just IT support?"" We reply and say yep, and he just immediately leaves with an ""OK thank you"".

Of course we're weirded out

Again another few days later, but as he's already lit his cigarette, he kinda has to come out now. We're wary of him, this guy is a fruitcake. He tries to make small talk; it seems to me he's probing, so I just come out and talk about what we do all day, pretending to moan about our menial duties.

Anyway, this time with his wife in tow. It turns out that he has every right to have been nervous.

This guy was initially hired as part of a major projects team in the organisation. He applied for a role, as it turns out, in between getting confirmed for his role and actually starting, the entire major projects department had gotten nuked. The manager who hired him had left the business, members of the team were scattered far and wide, yet he showed up, some receptionist showed him to his desk where he was to wait for someone and nobody showed up. He made enquiries

For the last 11 years, sometimes he just doesn't show up and nobody questions it, he gets paid every month, gets a statutory annual pay rise and that's it. He's been filling his time writing books for the past 8 years on this that and the other, and that is literally what he does every day. As the physical office he's in also has a high staff turnover, there's no time to make relationships or for anyone to even really acknowledge him.

Of course

That was until the Monday morning, sure enough, there he is with Word opened and he's tapping out page 370  for a novel. He never seems to do anything. Of course, he's back to being nervous again as he let his guard down while drunk and told someone. Even his wife at the time seemed to corroborate his tale.

I left the contract a couple of months later

On my first day of that role, let me through with an ""OK must be a mess up"". One even said ""Who's your manager?"" to which I replied ""I have no idea, I've only just arrived."" He too allowed me through. What I went into was an entire day's induction for permenant staff. A lot of sensitive stuff got said, a lot of activities went on - nothing catastrophically major, don't get me wrong - but there we have it. On leaving and switching my phone back on, I had several voicemails from my recruiter demanding to know my whereabouts. I told him I'd been in induction which surprised him. It took me another 30 minutes to track down WHICH IT department I was even supposed to be in, and even a day later got told I was still in the wrong place while I was arms-deep into laying some network cable! 

This place was so disorganised

Lucky - fkkk!!!!!!

Me: Pro AV Corp. This is Ted. Can I help you? 

SW: Hi

Me: Pretty good...um...Mr. Wonder? 

SW: HA HA! Just call me Stevie

Me: OK

SW: Well

Me: Totally. Me too. 

SW: Yeah, too. We love these recorders. But the thing is, you see, I need to set the record settings right. I got the transport, but I need to know if I've set everything to, like, a clean slate so I know where I am. 

It's at this point where I remembered that Stevie is blind. His recorder has a small screen and umpteen zillion possible adjustments and settings. 

Me: I got ya. So what we need to do is get you to factory reset

SW: Right

I walked him through which buttons to press and how many clicks of the dial to get to the reset

SW: OK, ENTER. Click down four times, ENTER and CONFIRM. 

Me: Um

SW: Just 192K MP3. Is that the default? 

Me: Nope. The default is 16/44 WAV. We need to set the Record setup for MP3.

Me: ""Sure I'll get right on it"".

I went in to look at the PC after he had left and found the cable/DVI adaptor at the back was loose. Plugged it in

My boss returned a few hours later.

Boss: ""Have you had a chance to look at my second monitor? It's not turning on at all now"".

Me: *thinking WTF*

Me: ""Yeh

I walked into his office to find the VGA/DVI adaptor had now come completely unplugged. I thought someone was playing a cruel practical joke on me

To explain the next bit I will try to give you a good visualisation of the room. My boss's desk is like this http://i.imgur.com/YTPH3.jpg he has his PC in the corner completely exposed at the back. All was fine for a couple of hours. I was in his room having a quick 5 minute meeting with him. I was stood about five feet away from him facing his desk while he was sat down.

It was at this point I heard a scraping across the floor. I scanned downwards to see where the noise was coming from. Our office tortoise* was making his way across to my boss's PC. He arrived and started climbing up the back of my boss's PC

I laughed so hard that I nearly ended up crying. Thwarted by a tortoise. When I finally calmed down enough from my hysterics with my boss sat there looking at me like I'd gone mad I told him to come to the other side of the desk as I'd found the cause of his monitor issues. I saw the look of realisation kick in because at this point the tortoise had managed to get himself tangled in the cables at the back of the PC.

So, or where they were. Not even which machine or server they were located on. With 5 machines and 4 servers to look through, this was no easy task.

I began by mapping out where they couldn't be, by guessing that since the pictures were of reindeer in the wild, they would have been taken in April or May. Alright, just 65 thousand files left.

By guessing that the files probably hadn't been color corrected or edited in any way I was able to narrow it down to only JPG and RAW files, I narrowed it down to filenames containing either ""Reindeer"" or ""IMG"". Only 1500 files to go. At that point I sort of ran out of clues, and had to result to looking through the images. 45 minutes later I found them, and not even the others in the office asking me how it could take so long could put a damper on my mood at this point. I felt like Sherlock Holmes.

The files were placed in the least likely place ever. The folder that held the old inDesign files for our crossword puzzles. Names ranging from IMG_1490 to IMG_1503

1367769067.0,1dqh8g,"A High School Network, Unreal Tournament, and Pickles",ePants,1756,205, I wasn't *technically* providing tech support

/u/Coolbrys recent story, though:  In this story I am the admin's adversary. 

Just prior to the turn of the century

##Freedom

My junior year, provided that we could pass the quizzes to show we'd retained the material. We could work on whatever side projects we came up with as long as it didn't disturb anyone. The teacher knew us and our ""elite skills"" well, so her trust was not *entirely* naive. 

Throughout the year we did various projects to keep ourselves busy and present to the class occasionally ""to prove we weren't wasting time."" It also served to make us into a sort of peer-role model

However, we were also getting frequently called to various other classrooms and computer labs throughout the high school to act as tech support. Our teacher was a little passive aggressive, so rather than tell us to stop wasting time gaming, any time she saw us playing she'd send us to help a teacher somewhere with a basic computer problem - word of our abilities spread quickly among the faculty. 

We addressed all the typical problems: Monitor power ≠ computer power, etc. Despite the trivial nature of most of our highly-praised ""repairs,"" on many occasions we had teachers volunteer their passwords. As if this weren't enough of a security breach, apparently each lab teacher had the admin password. It seems that the original network admin had done a web search for ""most common school network passwords,"" found a top ten list, and *picked the number one most common password* at the time: ""**pickle**.""

##Absolute Power Corrupts... Sometimes##

We deliberated for many days on whether this was useful to us, we could make any changes we wanted, and could cause the ""last saved by"" field to reflect *the name of* **any** *teacher with an account on the network*.

What did we do with all this power? Well, the rest of that year was entirely, believe it or not, shenanigan-free. 

The following year

##A New Year##

Over the summer a new IT company had been hired

Although most computer labs had been completely re-imaged, and I quickly distributed the game across the entire network. All in all, there were about 5 or 6 labs, with 20-30 computers each, so we had some pretty epic games going towards the end of each period as everyone finished their work, with as many as 90 players in a single free for all deathwatch. Those were glorious days. 

The teachers actually didn't seem to mind. They saw it as incentive for us to finish our lab assignments quickly. After a few weeks

##The Copy/Delete Battle##

At first

Then, I would use a different account to do the copying, which I think kept them from figuring out who the culprit was. 

Since this was time consuming

This worked well for a while

Crap. 

It was a long, but for some reason was overlooked during each wipe, and I hid a new copy of the game there for later. I don't know if the computer was even on site- the room number didn't exist anywhere at the school. Odd, but irrelevant. 

*Edit: In retrospect

##Work Smarter

Remember the off-hand comment I made about new cafeteria registers I mentioned? Those could only be connected to from a couple specific computers. It took me about a week of poking around the network every day before I found them

I have no idea why they were on the same network

After some manual trial and error, I added a new last line to each register's daily .bat file, which called and ran my own .bat file, so the game would propagate across the network every night at midnight - every time the registers updated their transaction logs. The best past is that every day it would randomly choose a different teacher's account to be the one doing all the copying. 

##Expect The Worst##

Given that I expected to be caught, I wanted it to be immediately clear I hadn't done anything as harmful as what the network setup would have allowed me to do. The closing bit read something like:

&gt;None of this would have been possible if the admin password wasn't freely given to students. Or if the password changed from year to year. Or if multiple remote access didn't mask the executing terminal. Or if the registers were not on the same network. (Seriously. Had I been malicious and not so bent on gaming

##The Prestige##

Every day

We continued our daily gaming sessions and even though my classmates had started to suspect I'd had something to do with it, the most gang-like guys in my class. One in particular had often asked me for help in the lab (he probably hadn't ever used computers before, honestly). He was actually pretty sharp, but kept up his ignorant thug persona when his friends were around. When he realized I'd been the one to ensure we could keep playing Unreal every day, he gave me props and said something about street cred. Not even kidding. I think that once he realized even a straight laced nerd like me could rebel against the system in my own way, he was more comfortable with admitting to being interested in learning. And you know what the best part was?

From that point on he always had my back in-game.

The early days of HP wireless printer issues still give me the shivers. Long story short after some work I get it going and everything is working great. When I pack up and settle the bill she shows me an external Hard Drive that she sued to backup stuff. Turns out it dropped of her desk and hasn’t worked since. I take a quick look hook it up and sure enough the drive doesn’t show.  I am upfront tell her that this is most likely a lost cause. I inform her about the cost of professional recovery and that she must REALLY want the data for that price. Data doesn’t seem that important to her but she keeps asking if there isn’t anything cheap we could do. 


Sooooo mind you this job has been over and this has been one of those “one questions real quick before you leave”. I tell her I can take it with me crack it open and see if I can read the drive on the computer I used to do data recover on. I tell her that this is a HUGE long shot and the external drive cage will be destroyed and if I do it we have to agree that I can recycle it if nothing comes of it since I didn’t want to drive that way just to bring back a bad drive on a job I don’t get paid for. She agrees I got paid and all is well.


Nothing comes of my effort to make the drive work again just I suspected and I call her to let her know. All is well…
Fast forward two month and a semi annoyed call. The printer disconnected and she can’t connect. Her husband never could and she is not happy with me. Oh and bring the drive back I took from her house… say what?!

Join me now for a sordid tale of a computer repair shop deep within the heart of low-income (A kind way to say it) area within a large city. That six months spent there was fraught with peril, repairing nothing but shitty Toshiba Satellite laptops and Gateway towers. This is but one of the awful memories I have of that den of horror.

Ours was a cozy little shack nestled deep within the heart of the downtown area. It was sandwiched between a head shop and what doubled as a gaming center (the sort old women with oxygen tanks and cartons of Virginia Slims to waste their Social Security checks) and occasional drug den. It was one of those dilapidated places that never had the latest hardware

This customer saunters in with a Gateway tower in tow. When I say ""tow"" I mean that he actually brought it in via a rusted red wagon. He felt the need to include his mouse, ask him what the situation is. He, instead of being a rational human being who can formulate complete sentences, yells back at me: COMPUTA' DON'T WORK.

I decided not to bother with trying to probe further, continuing to yell at me, said for me to ""YOU GET IT, NERD."" I wasn't really opposed to that so I hopped down from my chair, scurried around the desk and bent down to pluck his computer from the warm bosom of it's Red Flyer wagon. There was this very strange moment of tension that flared up between the customer and myself. All of it came from his end. I had, apparently, gotten a bit too close to him for comfort.

I had the tower clutched within my mitts as I moved back only to find that his rather LARGE calloused hands were not pulling the tower away from my grasp. I could not help the rather confused look that was plastered on my face at the moment

""CAREFUL HOW YOU GRAB MY SHIT

I had not tried to do that, angry person. ""That's fine then.."" I said as got back to my post, extending a set of friendly hands towards him. ""I'll just let you give it to me.. and I'll take a look at it.""
(This was not the first time I had dealt with this sort of customer before. Many who came in were either flat-out angry

So

I placed the tower down on the counter and spoke in the most calm yet assertive tone I could. ""Sir, FATBOY.""

There have only been three instances in my entire life where rage just consumed me. This was one of those three. I did not attempt to sound calm. ""GET THE FUCK OUT.""

He, by the way, and it was just about this time that the owner walked through the front door. He had been gone running some errands for the past hour. He saw that a situation was developing. ""There a problem?"" he asked, making sure, unlike myself, to be calm and collected.

The customer turned and remarked

So
She was angry because she had a lot of work to do and she had already spent quite a while trying to log before she called. I took a deep breath and asked her: ""Please, could you verify that Caps Lock is not active?""

She started ranting about not being her fault. She told me that the day before
I asked her what made her think that it had something to do with this whole matter. She said that her colleague ""left her information on the computer"".

I thought that, but her colleague's ""information"" was still there. I asked her to read that ""information"" for me. She read what it looked like a computer's name, which also appears at the top of the logon window (Brief background: This company uses a computer name convention that includes the name and last name of the computer owner).

Then I figured what the problem was.

I told her: ""Well, OR you have your colleague's computer.""

One of these customers was of the largest branches of a government suit that had users ranging from shift nurses to oil rig workers



One of these calls was from an elderly woman who presented herself as the head nurse of a retirement home that was in dire need of assistance with their... cheese wheel.

Paraphrasing this from memory

**Elderly woman**: ""The cheese wheel stopped working this morning

**Me**: ""The... did you just say cheese wheel?""

**Elderly woman**: ""What else would it be?! Your guys installed the thing

**Me**

**Me**

**Co-worker**: ""Che-- what? Are you sure you aren't getting a prank call?""

**Manager** stares blankly at me and checks the date

**Me**: ""Yes... cheese.""

**Manager**

**Woman**: ""Our bloody cheese wheel isn't fucking working anymore and your shitty phone man is not listening to me!""

**Manager**: ""I can assure you that we do not install cheese wheels as there would be quite the smell from rotting cheese after a while. Can you describe the object to me?""

**Woman**: ""It's giant, said &lt;funniest installation tech we've ever had&gt; when he plugged it in for us.""

**Manager**

**Woman**: ""YES! WHY ISN'T ANYONE HELPING ME""

**Manager**: ""I understand the problem at hand and will take the necessary steps to rectify your situation. A man will be at your location within the hour.""

**Woman**: ""THANK YOU."" &lt;click&gt;


The office landscape of 50+ people bursts into laughter and the installation tech in question comes strolling in at the most amazing timing anyone has ever had. The slowly developing shitfaced grin on his face as we explained why we were laughing was priceless. ""I knew this day would come, yellow and quite full of holes.

Working at the same call center as the earlier story **[(REFERENCE)](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/149flb/the_day_i_saved_a_little_girl_across_the_country/)**

This is about 2-3 months before this call, and ever will (since I don't do tech support anymore..)

More background on the situation.

I was a part time Tier 2 support at the time, and info from Tier 2 still at my disposal, so I had a bit more power than your average Joe.

So I just sit down

The caller is I would assume early to mid 20's woman. She called up because her internet is down, it's frustrating having to call and hope your issue will be fixed, we go over a few of the basic steps, everything seems to be in order, but her DSL light just won't stay on, it'll go on for a few seconds then drop. At this point I was doing a few tests, but tell her the bad news, as there seems to be issues on the line itself. (for what it matters, big difference) But as soon as I say technician she lost it, really

I ask her what's wrong? The internet will be up shortly, 10 minutes go by, and I'm still sitting there, trying to figure out what I do, do I hang up? Do I stay here? There's obviously something going on, so I stuck around, while my supervisor is tapping his wrist watch as I'm over my AHT of 8 minutes.

I ask her

8 months ago, raped her..

Now, and lots of unstable / ""crazy"" people. And ended up going out with a girl for over a year that was very unstable, she was violently bipolar, turns out she was raped a few years before that, and was also suicidal. I learned a lot about saying the absolute minimum during an episode as that can be a catalyst, just sit back, and let her vent


So here I am

At this point I tell her I need to run a few quick tests, and he tells me ""Just take her info, but fix her problem and hang up, I'll take care of it"". Clearly, he didn't give two shits, just wanted his metrics looking good at the end of the day. This guy was a tool, and in no way he was going to do fuck all with that info.

I do the only thing I know how to do, was it reported, you sure it was a XXXX ISP technician? (I was writing down the info make sure I can report this...).

She didn't have any names, in consecutive days, the same guy.

Never a call since

This is where I knew i fucked up royally, telling me how the only thing that stops her from killing herself is going online and finding somebody to talk to and comfort her online, playing games and all that. And now, her internet is down, and she needs another rapist to go over and fix her internet.

She starts telling me how she's been cutting herself all night, I've been through this before, and it felt like I was talking to my ex. It was too real.

She tells me how nobody would care, laying there rotting.

I asked her, father, siblings? She has a mother and sister, her dad left as a kid.

I asked her, don't you think they would miss you? You're her Daughter! You're her pride and joy, and your sister, don't you want your little sister growing up with you? (now I only went there because of the tone of how she mentioned her mom and sister, in a good light, compared to the rest of the call, so I took a risk.

She just talked for a good hour or so about her Mom and Sister, and should go visit her, she's still in the same town.

As this was going on, and if there is something we can do RIGHT NOW. Lucky for her, there was a tech a few miles away, and dispatch (having a bit of info on the situation) sent the tech to her CO, and replaced her line card (it was defective). All at the same time she was still talking about her family, clearly she was cheering up.

At this point, other agents on the floor were all starting to wonder what the heck I was doing.

Still probing her modem, and max speed of 21 Mbit. PERFECT!

At this time I ask her to take a look at her modem, and screams: My internet is fixed, my internet is fixed!

After a few more minutes, and I tell  her no, but she should report the issue, but she didn't want to and was scared. Not wanting to trigger a meltdown, didn't push anything.

She thanked me profusely, meet her sister, all that. I kindly explain, I'm just your internet tech support agent, I can't meet her and her family, but she should go visit them, and tell them about it. I tell her

I finish the call


Now

Since I had access to previous tech tickets

A little bit more probing with a friend in the tech depo, jailed, and obviously fired. Karma.


Now comes my supervisor, and giving ""unsupported"" help. 

I asked him what it's for, took too long, blah blah. He knew damn well about the situation, but didn't give a shit, it makes him look bad. I sign it, and tell him he's a piece of shit. I was anxious, nervous

2-3 months after this call I was full time tier 2 support

Story here for those who missed it.
http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/149flb/the_day_i_saved_a_little_girl_across_the_country/


It's now been 8 years since I worked there, he never got the job (I didn't say anything). I don't know what he's doing.


TL;DR
Got a call from woman who got raped by the ISP Technician, listened, comfort her. Solve her issue via chat while we were still on the line. Was never reported but tech was later arrested for same thing with different person.


PS: I don't remember the exact details in what she was saying, but I was only paying enough attention to keep her busy, while I solved her issue.

There is no way I could of fixed her problem if it weren't for having direct access to the chat system the technicians use.

I was the only one in one day as the other guy was off on holiday, keeping on top of workflow, all good.

Later in the day one of the teachers popped down so I could give her some new software she wanted on her laptop.

I put the software on

One thing she mentioned was qrcode implementation in field trips, demonstrating that I had downloaded a qrcode scanner onto my blackberry. She also had a blackberry but hadn't a clue, so I showed her the app store on blackberry phones, which in turn she showed on her blackberry (a older model) that she didn't have the app store. I explained how she would get the apps onto the phone from her pc, which she was grateful for. 

She then continued to talk about her past with phones and problems she's had, it was her god-daughters wedding, who was married to a guy who had just came back from his 2nd tour of Afgahnistan and they had just had a baby. I was worried she was building up to ""and he's been killed now"" but thankfully I was spare the awkward social moment, as that wasn't the case. 

She lost 50 odd pictures and 10ish videos

Apparently she went to her mobile service provider's phone shop and asked if there was a way to recover the photos, and that he'll have a look at fixing it, but eventually returned and said there was nothing he could do. He had spent every possible way he had thought of fixing it.

I was sympathetic and asked if she had a memory card in the phone, in which I spotted a card in an unusual (for blackberrys) spot. 

I took it out and asked if it was cool to look on it, I backed them up on a USB stick for her to take and transfer onto her computer.

1357819072.0,16b69a,"""I'll take the antenna down!""",vonadler,1529,281,208,"This story is pretty funny

Allow me to explain. Back when I studied at the university, support for a few muncipality/city nets and served as the first point of contact for a company that used to own us (we branched out to do more than just support us, they sold us to focus on their core business, but we still did first point of contact for them).

The company delivered high-speed internet connections for companies, companies and associations. A large part of of their network was radio LAN. This was around 2000, before a lot of fiber had been laid down to build an extensive fiber net over the country - connecting customers to radio LAN to the few large-capacity fiber lines in existance was a good business back then.

Around 2002, are being bought out by a LARGE power company that wishes to acquire the fiber net they have laid out and branch out in their own ISP business. Everyone is happy - we because we can have continued business, they because they won't have to go bankrupt and the large power company because they get a good net and customer base really cheap.

So, and were asked to document everything in case it looked like someone had been disconnected by mistake, send a case to the technicians and let them handle it from there.

So

ME: ""[company] support.""

HIM: ""Hi. I have an internet connection from you guys

ME: ""Ok

HIM: ""No

ME: ""Oh

HIM: ""Nope

ME: ""There must be some kind of misunderstanding. We don't sell individual connections.""

HIM: ""You did to me.""

ME: ""The info I have is that we never did.""

HIM: ""Look, I got free internet from you. It has worked fine for 4 years, now it doesn't.""

ME: ""Ok

HIM: ""Fine. Thanks.""

So, perhaps understantably, close the case, saying he is not a customer, they do not provide individual connections, and he is not getting his internet back.

So

ME: ""Hello again

HIM: ""Oh yeah

ME: ""Unfortunately

HIM: ""What? Get back to them and tell them that if they don't restore my connection

ME: ""I don't think that will help

HIM: ""Thanks.""

So I re-open the case, with a belitteling comment about not believing people that are not customers and not re-opening such cases again. At that time I was busy, so I did not have time to call the customer back with this and by lunchtime, I had almost forgotten it all.

Until the manager comes running. 

MAN: ""Get back on the phones! The [company] line is going mad!""

ME: ""What? What happened?""

MAN: ""They lost [large geographical region with about 20% of the customers]. It is completely black!""

ME: ""I think I know why.""

Yes, but never put it to paper. They had given him a 100/100Mbit connection with 1:1 contention which he used for e-mail and checking some forums and read newsapers online.

They made him a special deal and connected him to a 10/10Mbit 1:32 (I think it was) line

I go back and check that the largest file size we've received was under 1 meg and that was uncommon.  So we ask for a test file to check the process.  We get *test.zip*

So I open that *test.zip* and find the same exact 4 Excel files and...drumroll...another file called *test.zip*.  Extract that one and again find the same 4 Excel files.  Call their guy back and explain our findings.  They mod their process and the zip file is about 300kb.

S.O.P. was to delete anything remotely personal. Music? Check. Downloaded (likely illegally) movies? That's a check. Pictures that aren't related to work files? Definitely a check.

**Story**: Enter Flood. Why did we call the user Flood? Well

Yes. A question roughly every ten seconds. Thankfully, my response every time was to RTFE, aka, to refer to the email that was sent to him. This email outlined a series of steps that needed to be perform before migration. Oh, don't get me wrong, we still migrated the machine. The steps the user took would include backing up their work files and clearing space for us.

Flood didn't seem to read the email... or it's sister mailing... or the one after that. We sent these emails out in bursts. Two weeks before. One week before. Three days. Day before. Day of. So

On a 500gb hard drive.

I'm not about to skip him and make him try again

I find a nested tree of My Documents folders. No worries there. What's in them is mostly work related, Flood thought he was clever, in that he named the folders to be vaguely work sounding.

Sadly, also, did the photos. 50gb of pictures, and I wish I was making that up. Well, the past has taught me to take extensive documentation, so I snap pictures of all of this, then frag it. I then rearrange the My Docs folders, and shazam. We have the space to migrate! I kick it off

Cut to the next morning

""im missing files plz visit""

""folders missing plz""

""plz fix my pc""

1345967615.0,yugsk,A student changed 'Start' menu text to 'Penis' on hundreds of workstations,farkanoid,1661,437,203,"I worked as a general tech at a local high school around 2000. They had hundreds of workstations running Novell Netware on-top of Win95



Computers were generally off-limits during lunchtimes, most of the students would play Star-Craft and GTA over the network, others would browse the web and mess with Visual Basic 5 for class


Later on in the year, or closer to 15 minutes if the image is streamed over the network)


Students have their own 'drives' and desktops mapped to sub-folders on the server, Drivers, NetBEUI &amp; Novell stacks, and shortcuts to Snappshotted applications on the network


After restoring a few machines, so I casually walked across the lab, hoping to get a glimpse of the screen as I passed by


Sure enough, as the culprit must have messed up modifying the file the first few times before figuring it out. Needless to say, I wiped the affected machines and restored a known-good image after everyone left. This happened on and off over the next week, until I started receiving concerning emails from staff saying *their* machines have been affected too


One email stood out in particular, a nickname the students had given her, as it rhymes with her surname and reflects her default demeanor. I admit that I may have been rooting for the under-dog a little, I watched with glee as she tried to hilight and delete the text on the start menu (to no avail, of course)


Over the next few days


Some departments started becoming super-snappy towards me, but I was not to mess with configuration, user accounts or network policies, that was someone elses job. My job was to run leads, replace cards, troubleshoot and 'format' machines, no more.


Feeling like my job was on the line, the seniors nick-named today's one ""Office bitch"". I asked him to have a seat, and show me exactly what he does to log into the machine to play games


He entered the username/password combination of student/student - apparently only 12th graders get their own logins, which use library/library. Immediately after start-up, I notice a black command prompt appear for a moment with nothing but a blinking cursor, then the machine reboots automatically. I ask him to log in again, after which the command prompt appears for under a second, and the desktop shows up


Lo and behold, I get it, penis (man I miss high school). Only this time there was a subtle change; the windows logo next to the text was replaced with crudely drawn penis with and similar colour scheme. At this point I was unable to contain my laughter and chortled repeatedly, I got an ""I know, right?"" chortling from office boy in return, too. I haven't seen anything like this since my Amiga days (I posted elsewhere that the 'Revenge' virus on Amiga changes the mouse pointer into a penis)


Figuring it's something being messed with server-side


I open the aforementioned batch file, explains the blinking cursor and nothing more - Next few lines are conditional IF EXISTS statements to determine the likely windows version (and if the machine has already been patched). Next, xcopy is called to copy one of four possible Explorer.exe files from a publicly accessible directory, and finally, rundll is called with SHExitWindowsEx to reboot windows. I felt bad undoing the changes and deleting the files, but it had to be done


I then did a global search for explorer.exe on the student directory, and he'd definitely be suspended or expelled if caught. I removed the files and left him a README.TXT file explaining how I found him, that I could have lost my job, and that I won't be telling the staff. I actually lost my job a few days later anyway, so I didn't get a chance to hear what happened next.


As to how the infections started, and particularly how the ""Psycho!"" text only affected the library machines


...As for staff machines getting affected


**tldr; 12th grader finds out global login script is writeable, staff were affected because they secretly joined student multiplayer games**

She asked me if she should shut everything down and I told her no, XP...P4), checked the processes running, cpu utilization, virtual memory, pagefile, basically overkill on the notes because I wanted to make a good decision. As it turns out

I did some shopping and came up with a machine for her

The next morning she came to me

I told her that it was already ordered and she said that I could cancel that order anytime; she was sure of it. She thrust the papers onto my desk and said that her husband had spent a few hours last night researching the exact machine she should get.

She had a number of points:

1. 4 GB of RAM was not going to be enough.
2. A core i5 wouldn't be powerful enough.
3. He had picked a few machines that would be more suitable.

I summoned every oodle of patience I had and explained to her that I had taken copious notes about her machine and how she used it. That I had then chosen a very suitable machine for her.

He had selected a gaming machine (said so right on the sheets of paper she had) and I explained to her how a gaming machine was not necessarily suitable for office duty. I showed her how it had a $450 video card in it. I showed her that while the machine I selected did indeed have only 4GB of RAM

I smiled at her and said her husband had great taste in computers and obviously knew his stuff. She seemed a bit befuddled but mercifully wandered away from my desk without any further issue.

[How I visited the CEO

And now

   
  
   
If you've been reading the stories above, my very first IT job. It was time to let go, say goodbye, and ring down the curtain.

And it was time to do it with style.

---  

Now, I would get a photo of me and the CEO smiling together and put it on my desk. He would try and loom menacingly over me, I would run my chair wheels over his shoes. We'd bring each other up on charges in front of tribunals and legal hearings, try and get each other fired, that sort of thing. Both of us were too slippery to really make anything stick, him because of his connections and me because I was smart and bored and I'd actually read the administrative process manuals.  

So the stage was set for a showdown.  

Now one of the things the office manager was very smug about was that he'd decreed (not openly, making them resign or have breakdowns, he'd never been successful with me. But he wanted to break me. Oh, he wanted it bad. And that was his weakness.

   
  
   
Once I'd decided that it was time for me to move on, and used that day to visit over twenty other offices of my employer in the city. I only spent a few minutes at each one, and what I did was to ask to see the manager (or acting manager), and tell them that I was interested in moving away from my current office and into theirs. I brought copies of my CV and examples of all the savings I'd made and work I'd done to date taking my office to the top of the state rankings. Some of the managers had even heard of me, which was quite gratifying. And I would thank them and move on to the next office, and the next, and the next.  

I got back to work the next day, and he was furious! I might weasel out from under his control! He'd be putting a stop to this, by thunder! And so he kept an eagle eye out for any incoming contact from other offices, and when they expressed an eager interest in acquiring my services, he would shred the messages and tell them I wasn't available. This kept him so busy that he didn't notice me taking a rather long and intense call on my lunch break, or that the call originated from the national capital, from within a quite different branch of the Service.  

After he'd concluded that he had stamped out any chance of me getting a job from any of the other offices in the city, and contacted his network of cohorts and those the location of whose skeletons he knew. It took him quite some time, but he eventually nailed down the chance of me being promoted or transferred AT ALL without his say-so as office manager. So now I couldn't go anywhere. Not in the city, not in the state, not in the country, not even to another Department. I was completely, absolutely

The manager, when the Department was merged with a little mini-department the week after, and their staff were being placed tempoarily in our offices in various positions, the office manager decided that he was going to take his first vacation in ten years. He did this in the knowledge that his job would be filled by an incoming manager from the other department, and that that manager would be completely useless because the office was actually run by the triumverate of nasty under-managers who would proceed to eat his replacement alive, meaning he would be all too glad to move on after that time. Oh, and just in case I got sneaky, transferred out of the Department

   
  
   
And so it came to pass. And verily

O Captain, you are going to get a request from one of the offices in this city, an office which I have not physically visited on my day off but which I have kept in contact with through other means. The request will be that I be transferred to that office for a temporary period of one month. You are going to authorize this request, and you are going to do it the moment it arrives. For verily, I am young and confident and you currently have the mental fortitude of Jello, and I seem to be the only person in this establishment who both knows what they are talking about and is not actively undermining you every hour of the day.  

And yea, did the replacement manager sign it, for as the office manager he had the authority to sign temporary inter-office transfers for the purposes of cross-training and such buzzword-compliant purposes. And thus did I pack my desk and head off to the other office for, as it seemed on the surface, the duration of one month only.

   
  
   
A minor victory

Only... there was that little matter of the paperwork I had sent to another Department, had been my interview. And I had won the job.  

Except that in order to take it

...but the manager at the office I'd be at for one month? COULD.  

   
  
   
No

**DID.**  

I mean

You see, and for me to achieve a great big honkin' triple promotion and pay rise in what was my second-only tech support position ever.  

   
  
   
The change of status, recorded, and dryly published in small writing in the Service Gazette.  

I photocopied the relevant section

---  

And that, put the dust of my home town behind me, came to the  Capital, and started working for a very powerful government department indeed.  

During my time there

I would take over two hundred calls a day. I would see my first truly multilanguage batch file in the wild. And it was at this very job

For our non-University guests, this isn't something that can be done for everyone in the past.

I had submitted around six proposals to this Dunder-Mifflin reject, to sort out what went where, and to label it all.

Denied every time, stating that it wasn't in the budget, or that he couldn't be bothered to pay for the time. This meant that if something broke, I was expected to drop everything to fix it.

So, Lab 435 is down, and there's a class in there in two hours.

As the years passed, because they had removed my ability to have more than one intern. If Jackass Manager asked me where I was, I told him, and informed him of what could have prevented the downtime.

My pleas for new or newER equipment were still ignored

Cut to the last hour+ of my employment there. I was leaving for greener pastures to work with a team at a medical facility. It was my dream job, I would go to Mr. Jackass and inform him of the situation.

Mr. Jackass is on vacation.

I go in and assess the damage, and tell her that he needs to authorize emergency overtime for me, as well as prepare to be contacted by HQ regarding the equipment. She calls. She's a nice lady. Kinda hot, too. I sit outside of the server room, waiting, when my cell rings. It isn't a number I know, so it must be Mr. Jackass. It is.

Confirms it's me. ""Under no circumstances are you to stay over your 40 hours. Fix it."" Hangs up.

I stare at the cellphone, to call me. I then unplug the three switches and gather their cords up, placing them in one box. I know HQ will want these, so I label the box and hand it to the newly-arriving Assistant. She asks what I'm doing. I tell her I'm doing damage control until 4:00PM.

She begins to laugh. ""He didn't approve the overtime

Nope. I immediately begin to bring down the administrative network and restore it using the shittiest switches that I had. I filmed all of this with my phone, and they're going to get it.

Instructors are coming down to find out what is going on, so they all at least liked me if not loved me. Every single one of them left the room laughing. I leave detailed notes, both digitally and on paper, as to what has happened, what needs to be done to fix it, and why I'm leaving the site at 4:00PM. I save copies of the filmed work on three locations, head to the office and grab my stuff. Hands are shaken as I inform the intern about what has gone down.

At 4:04PM, and give him Level 2 tech's cellphone, which L2 had already bade me do. 

At 4:19PM, as has the Level 2 technician, and that it's out of my hands. I tell him what I did with the networks, and that I left crystal-clear instructions with everyone who matters. 

He demands that I return to the site. I laugh in his ear, I'll go buy the equipment personally. He starts raging, threatening to fire me if I don't get to the store, buy parts, and get the school back to 100%. I ask if I get overtime, he yells no, and I calmly state the next bit:

""You cannot fire me, and you chose to ignore them. I included that in my communication as well. Now, lose my phone number, because I'm not your employee any longer.""

I hang up to the sound of his rage. Three hours later, none of them had seen me, nor had my phone number. 

I found out later that this incident, but I was better, and they took him to task for it. Intern ended up helping them fix everything, then replace everything, and was finally hired on as my replacement.

For the past 7 years I have worked for the same company. Without getting overly specific, do some HTML5 coding and do graphic design work. We are a small company and I am the resident tech person, so I am a jack of all trades. Over the years I have grown to dislike the people that I work with immensely. They have:


Stolen my food (I am gluten intolerant so I make the effort to make my own food...and people go through my lunch and eat it anyway), they are condescending and I am routinely taken for granted. I have gotten verbally assaulted more times than I can count and I am severely underpaid. I can't even use them as a reference for future jobs because I simply can't trust them - the person that had my position before me used my boss as a reference (and my boss agreed to give him a good recommendation), and I heard my boss trashing my predecesor to a potential employer over the phone. Super classy.


I am quitting this terrible job to go back to school. When they hired my replacement

Anyway


Last week had been busy since we have clients in, and I have been compensated ($10 a day, nothing crazy). I brought up compensation this time around, and my boss gets in my face, and says, ""I didn't realize your computer came with a fee. I thought you had been sharing the company computer with your replacement.""


I had obviously not been sharing my company computer with my replacement


I didn't say anything because I knew whatever came out of my mouth at that moment wouldn't be constructive. However


I didn't bring my computer into work the next week and the entire workload was shifted to my replacement. I was working in the respect that I was going over things that my replacement didn't understand (which was a lot, and I said, ""Well, since I am sharing a computer with my replacement, and he's been really busy with the clients, I haven't had a chance to get to it."" My boss looked unhappy but was unable to admit his mistake - and by the time he realized the extent of his mistake, it was too late.


Since I wasn't there to shoulder the workload, which equates to hundreds of thousands of dollars lost) that we had in our office. I watched the world burn. This past week was my last week, and this was a sweet way to go out.

The first incident was the year my high school tried to have a programming elective. They were trying to teach Java, and said ""Stop. I don't care what you're doing, just stop."" Pretty much word-for-word, with a tone that suggested any second now I might hear ""Step away from the computer...""

This being high school, I discovered that while the network folders were locked down with reasonable permissions, the local drive was entirely world-writable. So Windows explorer was actually enough for a DoS of sorts -- I could open C:\WinNT and just start deleting things. Or worse, if I was clever enough to rootkit them. I wasn't, and I didn't care, it was just fascinating. Maybe someone upgraded from a FAT32 drive? How does this happen?

**TL;DR: Surprisingly justified paranoia.**

While I'm at it, as there would be a number of login scripts which would fail because of this on every login.

Few students were willing to risk putting such illicit material as Doom on the network drive, so this allowed us to play Flash games, as well as easily configure proxies. (I also ran a proxy outside the school network, as the school had the ISP filtering content for us, and an actual Squid proxy pretty much completely defeated this filtering.)

How was this possible? Doom and Firefox certainly weren't on the whitelist! Ah, just the filename. Once I discovered this, we all had multiple subfolders consisting of various 'notepad.exe' files. Any class in which we all had access to a computer lab and were ever left unsupervised would devolve into a Legacy Doom LAN party -- these may have been ancient NT4 machines, but Doom was much older and ran perfectly.

2010 comes along, whether it be a PHP/mySQL website, a VB.net site, a WPF Information kiosk, or an iOS app, but to also make sure that I assist any of the other 150 employees with tech support by phone, email

2011 comes along and I graduate with a Bachelors in Computer Science, Tikrin, and Derpette. Boss sits in his lair and only helps with work orders if I can directly prove that he has messed up on his DNS,switch, server, or router settings. Derpette is a VOLUNTEER. This is where I suppose the story comes in.

Derpette, she started to email our ""comments"" email about how she could improve our websites that we have. Back to 2011, administration at the organization have decided that it would be great for her to volunteer and help me out with the websites. Always looking for a break, we sit down and discuss what we both know. I quickly find out that she has no idea what HTML is, no idea what a motherboard is, no idea on anything tech support related besides some intermediate Windows knowledge.

I try informing the higher ups that she doesn't have a skillset that would really benefit IT, btw. Late 40s, early 50s. I finally provide a back end interface solution for some of our websites. This is good, because she understands this. She starts spellchecking, and making sure blogs look good. Something I don't have to worry about, this works for me.

Towards November of 2011, and several other things. She's finally catching on to tier 1 tech support things. 

Boss finally installs a time clock server so I no longer have to walk 100 yards to another department to clock in/out with card. However, to manage my time clock. So if I forget to clock in, she would be the one to approve of the time clock.

Alright, and she's approving my time worked. Being a good ole secretary, or so I thought.

December 2011, and would rather try to do it, than not. I also tell him that I understand if he has to take it higher up. He replies with a ""I'll see what they say"", and CCs Derpette to let her know that I may be doing this for 2 hours a week.

I, asking why I thought it was okay to email my boss first instead of her. She starts rambling about a chain of authority and how I shouldn't circumvent it. I inform her that Boss is my boss, and the first person I should be asking. She responds with another email saying that we will talk personally about this the next day.

Next day comes along, and she says that I should do them because she wouldn't have sent them to  me otherwise. Oooookay.

So, 45 miles away. They email to say that their dual monitors are not working anymore on one of the computers. Derpette emails them back and says that I would gladly start driving that way.

I inform her that I would not and that we could either try to remote in, and give it back with two new DVI cables. I even write down some instructions of how to set up dual monitors.

A week goes by, one of the DVI cables is not hooked up. Simply hook it up, and yep, dual monitors working. I take a picture and text it to Derpette for accountability that the problem is now fixed. I then start to head back to my office, 45 miles away.

I

She then forwards me an email between the remote location and her. In the PS section, so turn around and go do it.""

I flip, it ends with a, ""We'll discuss in person tomorrow.""

So I drive back to the remote location

NEXT DAY: I come to work, and pulls up a chair. She then says, ""It's sad that I have to tell you I'm your boss...but I'm your boss. And you should consider yourself lucky, or you would be fired after what you emailed me yesterday."" My boss then walks in to crack a joke about something(I could tell from his smirk), but she quickly demands that he leave so that ""we"" could talk. She then rants on about how she has been my boss ever since the time clock server was installed and was absolutely shocked that I didn't pick up on that. 

I tell her that no one has ever told me that she was my boss, you should just know. I'll have to bring this up to Administration, because your lack of respect isn't going to get you anywhere.""

The door swung open and the guy asked me for identification. I was rather confused, then looked back at me, then looked back at the picture and then said ""Okay you check out.""  I am not really sure who I check out with but...okay, I check out.

I stepped into the house and I was instantly overwhelmed with the smell. The guy immediately gave me a feeling of [Randy Quaid's character](http://i.imgur.com/uYPHL1q.jpg) from ""Not Another Teen Movie"".

The conversation that took place inside the door was him telling me that his computer was running slow

I asked him to take me to the computer. When we walked through the house, then enter the room. He did this through the two rooms we passed through as I followed him. I was already regretting stepping foot in the house.

We made it into his kitchen. His computer sat at a table

The first thing I noticed was that his ""gaming computer"" was conveniently housed in a Compaq Presario case

By this time I am *really*

""Okay, latched a boot to the faucet, put the exit tube into the sink and then turned the cold water on.  He then walked back to the computer and hit the power button.

I walked over to the sink, there has to be cameras somewhere around here."" But nope. Guy was serious.

The computer booted after a while. I told him to go ahead and shut it down

I told him that I needed to pop the side panel off the computer. He was hesitant and said ""I am going to watch you

I popped the side off the tower, teflon line ran in one hole, did two big loops and then ran right back out the second hole. I could hold the panel and there was no plumbing connected to anything but the panel. *Every time this guy booted his computer, he would turn his sink on, water would run through this system and then discharge back into the sink.*

The first thing I noticed was the liquid cooling plumbing, tobacco, cat hair and I would imagine other stuff that would give me some incurable disease. The fan in the back of the computer was so packed full of...icky that it wasn't even turning anymore.

I instinctively blurted out ""This isn't liquid cooled, his nephew knew more.

I told him that the teflon tubes were doing absolutely nothing but sweating

After trying to explain to this guy that the computer needed blown out to get rid off all the dust, he called me a liar. I had met my limit and although ""I can't fix this"" usually isn't in my vocabulary, I said ""I can't fix this.""  To add insult to injury, the guy then said ""Yea, my nephew said it was a pretty complex system that most techs wouldn't understand."" 

I then made the mistake of telling the guy that his nephew was screwing him

About a week later my phone rang with his number again. I let it go to voice mail. The message was basically berating me because his nephew had come over and had the computer fixed within 20 minutes and it only cost him $100.

I shot down to my local PD to talk to them to see if there was anything I could do. But the PD basically told me I was powerless. The guy didn't do anything directly to me and unless he specifically complains about being taken advantage of

I tried to back track who he got my number from, but I couldn't find out how he got my number. Unfortunately everything I tried just ended up in a dead end. While I was there I sincerely wanted to take pictures of it, but I am pretty sure if I whipped out my phone and started taking pictures, this dude would have lost it.

So as far as I know, it starts with him walking to his sink, turning on the water and then booting his computer. I highly doubt the computer is even actually running anymore. I've worked with elderly people and other questionable people in the past, but no one ever to this point. I now question people when they call me on how they got my number. That way I can at least back track for information a little bit.

TL;DR: Got a call from a client to fix a water cooled computer. ""Water cooled"" ended up being a teflon line running from his kitchen sink faucet

It was March 31st 2010 around 8:45pm PST. I thought it'd be a good idea to create a subreddit called /r/administrators. I planned on using the subreddit to post about my own tales from tech support back before /r/talesfromtechsupport existed. So I happily created my new subreddit, by the time I had finished creating the subreddit the time had ticked past 9pm PST, which means it was now April 1st on the East Coast of North America. April Fool’s Day.

As some of you may remember, and have all of the powers that subreddit moderators had. Unbeknownst to me, it was now April Fool’s day and the Reddit prank was in full force.

After I had clicked the “create new /r/administrators subreddit” button… I suddenly had moderator powers over all of reddit. I was ecstatic! Somehow I had found a bug in reddit’s website code that had granted me administrator powers throughout the entire site! Oh the power I now had! I quickly resolved that I would only use my powers for good

I called one of my co-workers who was also a redditor and explained to him what had happened . There was an long pause on the phone while he took it all in. Then with a chuckle said to me… “llnk

To my defense, that’s no excuse for an April Fools internet veteran like myself. Never again would I let my guard down on March 31st and April 1st. I won’t get fooled again!

I was doing my rounds when I walked by the tech counter (well before Geek Squid). The tech who I will call the little ball of hate or LBH was working with a customer who was picking up his PC we serviced. I guess the customer didn't like the charge for repair as this transpired.

Customer (screaming): ""TWO-HUNDRED DOLLARS TO FIX MY COMPUTER! YOU F-ing THIEF! HOW COULD IT COST $200 TO FIX MY F-ING COMPUTER!!! YOU ARE RIPPING ME OFF!!!!""

LBH (Equally loud): ""HEY! IF YOU DON'T PAY YOUR BILL I'M GOING TO TELL EVERYONE THAT YOU HAVE ANIMAL PORN ON YOUR COMPUTER!""

AT this point the customer turn as pale as an albino polar bear and is visibly shaking. He reaches for his wallet.

LBH: ""YEAH THAT'S RIGHT! PAY YOUR BILL MR. ANIMAL PORN!"" LBH looks at me who is also in shock. ""YEAH

It's been a long time. How have you been?

I've been really busy being dead. You know

**KERNEL PANIC - NOT SYNCING: FATAL ERROR IN NEUROTOXIN DEPLOYMENT**

**REBOOTING...**

Hello again

It has been a while

Today's story is simple, and details exactly what to do when your vendors refuse to replace equipment under warranty... or at least what I'D do.

- - -

LET'S DO THE TIME WARP AGAIN

- - -

The afternoon was boiling. Patton used to joke about renting out Texas and living in hell

Fortunately, and our coffee supply was flowing freely. When you have a conference room with a HUGE dark wood executive boardroom-style table and really comfy leather chairs and overhead lights with a dimmer switch at your disposal, you REALLY want to base your operations out of there, you know?

I'd just fired up a few tabs in Firefox with several subscribed subreddits for a fine, when one of the RNs (registered nurses) walked into the conference room where we were and looked expectantly in our direction.

""Um

Now, then idly entertain fantasies of flipping a table at them, but today I was feeling... uncharacteristically altruistic, for some reason (I think the caffeine did it), so I thought what the hell.

I motioned for her to tell me what was going on, we're an all-Dell shop here, and Dell stuff is usually pretty easy to clean / repair, but this particular model of printer... well, the Oatmeal was right when they said printers were sent from hell.

This particular one, but not from our printer service company, oddly enough) for that printer, and the logs on it were longer than a /r/politics thread about Michele Bachmann. After reading only a few of them - 75% of which were for it not being able to be cleared when paper got jammed in it, about 15% were for it spewing out extra sheets of paper, and 10% were for miscellaneous problems - I had but one reaction.

&gt;bertstare.gif

Now

I got one of the printer techs (we'd outsourced printer repair to a major printer / MFD / copier company within the past year) on the phone, you can't have a hotswap, this isn't a hospital facility, so it's not directly affecting immediate patient care.""

&gt;bitchplease.jpg

""I'm onsite right now and it's completely nonfunctional. We're supposed to pass these progress notes out to a patient as they leave. You're telling me that THAT isn't stopping us? That's a workflow stoppage right there.""

The tech groaned and grumbled.

""FINE. I'll see if I can get out there tomorrow to fix it.""

After a bit of finagling with his boss, queued jobs started spewing off, and - OF COURSE - right after he left, the printer jammed dead shut again.

A quick stroll down to the elevators resulted in my pulling him back in and having him fix it again.

""Look, let alone for parts to be available if - when - it dies again. It's no Laserjet 4. Seriously, can we get a replacement, preferably within the week, or at least a hotswap to tide us over until you all can fix this to a point where it doesn't suck like a Sears Shop Vac?""

""Nope, it jams on occasion, but what printer doesn't?""

""This thing has spent more time down than up! It's the printer equivalent of a hamplanet in a scooter! If it was working even half the time

""... Has anyone ever told you you're not really that good at analogies?""

""... just fix the bloody printer.""

The next morning, as the printer techs had stonewalled her for months over replacing it and she was tired of all the clinical staff complaining at her about it.

I told her that I would fix it out of hours that evening

""I don't know if we can wait through a whole day. Seriously.""

""For this? You'll want to.""

Her suspicious look was well-rewarded as I went into a full-on Gendo Ikari pose, it's got dark wood and black leather, you HAVE to go for the dramatics sometimes.

""I have two words for you. Plausible deniability. Now, and the printer will never trouble you again.""

She nodded

That day, though over the table she and I exchanged glances, and we knew that the 30 pieces of silver had been spent; the hitman had his blood money, and the target would meet its untimely end.

A short time later, and retrieved their office toolbox and two cables, then returned to my table. Opening the toolbox, I found a pair of wire cutters and a box cutter, and in about fifteen minutes, I had a tool that would solve our problems. I returned the toolkit to the comms closet, and sat quietly, not even the cleaning people. I'd queued up a certain song on my phone when I left the conference room

I reached the printer and couldn't resist.

""In the name of Gerald of the department of information services, Jack, of the department of information services, Bastard Operator from Hell, lord of the cubefarm, do sentence you to die.""

My hand descended into the pouch on my belt, and to use it guarantees instant death.

[It was an Etherkiller

Swift hands swapped the RJ-45 end into the printer's NIC

""Does the condemned have anything to say before the sentence is carried out?""

The display

""So be it. May your creator have mercy on your soul.""

As the famous finale started, and with a swift pop, the printer was ended, its metaphorical bowels emptying as the smell of ozone flooded the room. As the cannons in the overture blasted, I flipped the surge protector on and off in time with them, and continuous popping started sounding from the printer's smoldering corpse - capacitors bursting, I assumed.

I shut down the surge protector

- - -

THE NEXT MORNING (INSERT FFVII INN MUSIC HERE)

- - -

I was back at my desk at my cubicle in another building, and my desk phone rang. Caller ID showed that it was the printer tech calling from his desk phone, and with a grin, I picked up.

""Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyes?""

The tech's tone was frustrated and angry

""HOW DID THIS BREAK? IT WAS FINE WHEN I LEFT ON TUESDAY!""

""When I got back from getting dinner, it reeked! I almost threw up! Anyway, I unplugged it and made a ticket with you all.""

""... I'm going to pick it up in fifteen minutes. Do you want a hotswap?"" He'd gone from angry to defeated in a quick turn of events, then told him to call me when he gets there and I'd make the backend changes with the server team for the DHCP lease.

He did so

""What the hell happened to this? It's burnt! Every capacitor on the NIC has MELTED! ON BOTH SIDES! The NIC port has scorch marks on it! The entire motherboard is completely ruined!""

""Don't ask me

""The network admin here -"" (and it should be noted that the field services guys used to repair printers before the new company took over; the guy who'd had to cover that clinic had gotten promoted in that time) "" - he said it could have been a misconfigured power over Ethernet port that blew it out

""You may have to go out there with a current tester and try that drop. I mean

""We're ordering a new one. It'll be there in a week. They've got a hotswap

""Really? Thanks! You know how it is when we can't get work done. Thanks for taking care of this for us!""

He hung up on me. I'd SWEAR I heard a muffled sob on the other end of the line, and the patients could get both their progress notes and any EMR-printed prescriptions that the doctors needed to give out (I'm looking at you, Metformin).

I turned to my phone and played a quiet

Yesterday I had a customer come into the store and approach me while I was working with another. As I finished up, her response was ""You'd better."" with a stern 'matter-of-fact' look in her eyes. I just smiled and nodded at her without missing a beat (I have nearly 10 years of experience in technical support with much more 'official' job titles before going back to school, and this is not the first time I have dealt with this kind of person, immediately knowing what would be required of me next).  
&amp;nbsp;  
When I was ready
""You need to fix this RIGHT."" again
""Okay!"" I said
""Um, etc, etc"" this went on for about 2 minutes or so.  
""Okay! What seems to be the problem?"" I repeated
""THE WIRELESS DOESN'T WORK!"" she exclaimed as if I was a fool for asking because this was clearly the only problem any computer could ever have. ""You CLAIMED to have replaced something before and even told me you tested it here before you called me which you CLEARLY didn't because it doesn't work and I've been forced to use my external wireless thing for months now and this is extremely unacceptable! I spent a lot of money here at _RETAILER NAME_ and I expect the things I buy to work!"" as if the amount of dollars spent was the only variable that determines the rate of component failure.  
On the outside, let's take a look at the computer and see what we'll need to do to make this right for you!""  
&amp;nbsp;  
I did each of the following things without looking at her face. I grab her HP laptop, I notice a big red light on the F12 key next to a wireless icon (its the radio tower with waves coming off of it, pretty damn obvious, but I digress) which, when pressed turned green and immediately popped up a message saying ""connecting to XXXXX"" (proving that we DID in fact test in in store before) I opened her browser and connected to google.com. I looked up, without breaking character or batting an eye I said ""hmm, I seem to be connected to google
&amp;nbsp;  
needless to say, I guess I'll just take it...""  
&amp;nbsp;  
Time for my revenge (I can be a devious little fuck). Without changing my tone from this perfectly innocent retail employee that would never harm a fly, that was just the ON button for the wireless, I'm sure you tried that before didn't you?""

1341640424.0,w62i0,Phil 33 1/3: The Final Insult,SilentDis,1403,325,185,"Things continued swimmingly with Phil for the next few months.  [I could handle him](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/w4fwu/angry_clueless_you_have_met_your_match/)

Most of his calls were still entirely outside our support boundries; he had a horrible time with printers, and at one point his fridge that he was *sure* was Internet related.  Every time, I came down with the same firm response of 'Nope, we don't help with that.  Our stuff works, here's the number to talk to.'

I remember a few issues that I actually did help him with

Once, hosing his domain horribly in the process.  I did the expeditious thing and just took responsibility on that one; got the phone number for his support company, and 3-wayed him and myself in with them.  Phil verified security, and then handed off to me.  I efficiently listed off the A and MX records we needed, the other tech made the change, and we were done in less than 5 minutes...  I then took 15 minutes to explain to Phil how he's now waiting 48 hours for it to propagate down.  This set him off a bit, but I countered with the fact that he wanted to save the $10 and take all of it away from us, but that's what he'd have to deal with.  It shut him up

Another time, but he was on his own with AOL, and if it happened again, we'd just keep breaking AOL to make XYZ work; if he wanted better, talk to AOL or ditch them.

This got frustrating to Phil.  He couldn't have his rousing hour-long bitch-fests in which he'd make people cry; or make people question the life choices that lead them inexorably to dealing with their lord and master, because I had the answers, and the process down to an art.

So, after being told to take his printer problem elsewhere from me.  There was a big flag on the account indicating that he didn't get support from anyone but me, and sometimes he just found himself cold-transferred to either my voice mail or to my line if I was in.  That was perfectly fine by me, not to Phil of course, who'd just hang up when he herd my voice and re-call the main line.  I knew it was him, though, as our Caller ID system was sweet in that it kept original data through cold transfers.  I'd just make a note that he'd called and hung up.

After a time, if any actual calls from him lately.  At first I chalked it up to 'Oh, I finally clue-sticked him into understanding', but upon checking his account, I saw other tech's logs popping up, at weird hours when I was out of the office.

Thing is, plain as day.  *sigh*

I mentioned this to my supervisor, etc.  It was brought up at our monthly meeting, in fact (all techs for 2 hours in 1 room to go over general things like this, while Tier2 took calls directly); and stated in no uncertain terms that Phil doesn't get help from us, you dump him on this extension.  Period.

It helped little.  Many of you who've worked in tech know there's always a few low-hanging fruits in the group that just drag everyone else down.  When you have 75+ agents, thanks to a corporate environment.

Of course, he'd not call me anymore, because he found it much more fun to scream at the brick wall, or attempt the fun whack-a-mole game of finding the one bad (or poorly informed) tech to torment.

He got one, and now reduced to a puddle of tears in the middle of the isle.  She quit that day.  I knew what happened even before I'd been told directly, and I was furious.  I felt like I had personally let her down (regardless of the fact that she didn't heed the rather interesting special note and popup that his account generated... the only account that, when you pulled it up, would also pop a full-screen bright red box with 40pt white type that told you to direct the customer to me and not help them).

The next day, the telecom hardware director, and the system administrator (who managed the webhosting servers/email servers/etc).  I'd met all these people, and they were really decent folk; but I'll be honest, I figured they'd decided to blame me for the whole Phil situation that happened the day before to that poor girl, and I was getting the axe.

Another person in expensive suit and tie walked in

They started out asking how I felt about the whole situation.  They all knew I wasn't one to pull punches, rather crass.

I believe the first thing I said to this meeting of the big-wigs was ""From what I can tell of the people gathered here today, I admit it.

Deafening silence ensues.  It lasts a good few minutes.  I take stock of the faces in the room from my little tirade; the systems guys are eyes wide, attempting not to show his laugh.  Meh.  Let the fireworks begin, I'm going down with a bang, not a whimper in this one, I've decided.

The system administrator pipes up ""Umm... Actually... No.  But
""Well, then?""  

This got a laugh out of my floor supervisor

""Since you appear to appreciate bluntness, on the other hand, attempting to decide what to do about Phil.""  
""Since I'm not fired, I'd say it's pretty obvious 'what to do about Phil'.  He doesn't have more than a few thousand dollars a year in profit for this company, yet he's monopolized my time, and made a rather sweet new girl quit.  He is a horrible person, and should be kicked to the curb.""  Why sugar coat the obvious.

""That was our thought, we figured we'd try one other option.  Would you consider going 'on call' for Phil?  As in, we'd route his calls to a cell phone that you'd have 24/7.""  
""That depends

Everyone has their price

""Well
I cut him off.  ""Then that's not happening

This illicited a chuckle from the CIO.  ""I like you
""After what happened yesterday

And so it came to pass.  A registered, and watched it like a hawk.  I knew when it was signed for, and I even had a little digital copy of Phil's signature to prove it.  I gave him a half hour to read it, then called him up.

Me: This is SilentDis from XYZ support calling.  Is Phil available?  
Phil: Um... this
Me: Phil
Phil: You can't do this!  I pay my bills on time

This little tirade continues for a good 5 minutes.  It's normal Phil, and much of the upper management is currently listening in.  I respond back ""fuck you, I don't want a goddamn audience"" which earns me a distant guffaw from over the cubicle farm.  I mute myself as he's continuing to rant and shout ""Don't you people have anything better to do?""  A chorus of chuckles and ""No!"" rings back.

Phil eventually runs out of steam on his rant.  He's not switched to legal threats yet

Me: Phil, and you do not listen.  You cost us in man-hours more than what we make from the services we provide.  To top it off, you made a rather nice person quit her job after 2 weeks.  XYZ has decided that you are a liability to provide service to, rather than any sort of benefit.  Your service will terminate tomorrow at midnight.  At that time, we will make a final copy of your website, and of any e-mail sitting on our servers, burn it to CD
Phil: ""I don't know how to do that
Me: ""Phil, as a company, simply no longer wish to do business with you.  It's fine if you do not know how to backup your site, we're doing it for you anyway, and you'll get the CD in the mail.  Please understand, we will no longer help you with anything going forward, calls to this number will go unanswered, it's simply to inform you.  Good day.""  
Phil:  (he actually managed to respond just before I pushed release.  very meekly) ""Yeah

1343683648.0,xev2e,The teacher from hell,campycapper,1361,285,400,"I have a tale for you
For this tale I am going to call him Bob. 

Bob is a good guy except he believes he is a tech genius and that my job could be done by trained rabbits. Now I am going to have to back into this story a bit

A year ago I was able to get a grant and put new computers into every classroom in my school. (I am a teacher and a tech support) Every classroom either received laptops or really nice desktops. Now installing this computers was no issue

Over the last year

I have witnessed as he has attempted to installed (Did not know at the time how he was doing this because he did not have permissions) different software that dates back to the windows ME timeline

For the networking cables that run behind the computers

But this summer took the cake, it will not take me that long to re hook everything and do the maintenance. No such luck. 

I finally was able to get down to Bob's classroom and all the computers were still connected, but pain in the ass. I turn the breakers on and started the machines. The first machine I went to I tried to use the mouse and nothing, tried to use the keyboard and nothing. Checked the back of the tower and everything was connected and the board and mouse both had power going to them. Thought maybe they just did not recognize at first. Tech support 101, I restarted my computer. Same problem. So I decided to unplug the mouse and keyboard and replug them to see if they recognize. Sure enough familiar ping and new hardware installed correctly. 

My mind was boggled, and since I have seen this, I check my switch. Sure enough he has wired all of the network cables from the back of the towers to each other, and the computers on the end were tied back into the switch. Creating this giant loop of network cable ling that was tied and cut to make it ""good looking"". 

It was here that my mind started to explode, and Bob is supposed to be gone for two months. Nobody was to be in that room, it was locked up. Well I had to go on a business trip so I was going to finished updating and cleaning his computers once I got back. 

Then I went in yesterday. HE HAD DONE IT AGAIN! Every computer was cross wired. He had clipped the ends of the network cables

Bob no longer has computers. Apparently I was the only It guy willing to deal with Bob

Rather surprisingly, and I need a laptop to take with me, can I have one please?"" which leads to the inevitable ""No, you can't, because you didn't give us any notice and they're all on loan to other people."" and then someone going away in a huff and complaining about how unhelpful IT are. 

This time however the brief was remarkably clear. We need 4 laptops

Ok, that's a bit cheeky, because the research groups have their own laptops they they've paid for and _demanded_ root access to, and are therefore meant to manage themselves. However, since they'd actually given me a whole weeks notice I decided to be nice and set up their machines for them.

This was a mistake. 

*""What software do you have licensed for your group?""*
*""I don't know.""*
*""Ok
*""I don't know.""*
*""Right, I'll do a default install and can you please get back to me if there's anything above and beyond that that you need?""*
*""That sounds great

So off I go

*""So
*""I don't know what software we have licensed.""*
*""OK... do you know who does?""*
*""I don't know.""*
/sigh. 
*""I'll call around.""*

So I called around a few members of staff and finally managed to track down all the things that they'd ordered through purchasing, and took the machines back Wednesday afternoon. Whilst I was there asked them to do one thing: 

*""Could you please find someone who's actually going to this conference and get them to check that everything they need is installed on here before they leave?""*
*""I don't know who's going.""*
*""Well... find out and get them to check
*""Ok.""*

Fade to this morning...

11.45

*""Oh, and I need it for a presentation someone is giving at 2.""*
*""Ok... did you not check the laptop before taking it there like I asked you too last week?""*
*""Um... I don't know.""*
*""Do you have a licence for [software]?""*
*""I don't know.""*

At this point I'm wondering if there's anything they do know... like perhaps what day it is

*""Ok
*""I'm sure we do
*""Yes, and even if you were, we don't manage those laptops, you do. You insisted on it. As I explained to you last week, those machines are stand alone, and you need a stand alone licence. That's why I asked you what licences you have. We've been through this. Who handles licencing for your group?""*
*""I don't know.""*
*""Find. Out.""*

...but I'm feeling pretty good natured this morning, repeated in 2010 AND 2011, cc'd to this very person is the following. ""You can generate licence keys for [software] by going to [website] and entering your email address and the following [code]. DO NOT LET [person responsible for licencing] lose them, like they did last time. AND THE TIME BEFORE.""

I forwarded this on to the user out at the conference site

*""I got your email... I don't remember doing any of this before... [person responsible for licencing] says they've not done it either.""*

Really? seems unlikely

*""Well
*""Oh

...give me strength. 

*""No. Please follow the instructions on the website.""*

...an hour passes. The phone rings again.

*""[person responsible for licencing] says they've been trying this for an hour and it doesn't work. Help!""*
*""Have they followed the instructions on the website that I sent?""*
*""I don't know. Can I just bring the machines back in? I'm only a 10 minute drive away.""*

...ok, lets do it. 

*""Sure, and I'll test the licence generating thing whilst you're on your way.""*

Which I did. And it works. Perfectly. There is however a proviso, this means I don't have to go through the teeth pulling process of finding out how many steps in the software licencing procedure she doesn't know about. Instead, we'll just install the network licensed copy, set up a VPN so the machines think they're still here, and everything'll be good, right?

So she shows up, and I get to work. In the mean time, could she please tell me who's going to use the machines so I can pre-configure the VPN connection for them? 

*""Um... I don't know.""*
*""Right
*""I don't know""*
*""Fine... I'll look it up. What's your username?""*

...take a guess what's coming next...

*""I don't know.""*

So, configuring the VPN and with 15 minutes to spare before the 2pm presentation, she's good to go and taking them away again. Feeling pleased with myself both for a job well done, and not murdering her despite severe provocation, I go to lunch, like I should have an hour ago. 

I return from lunch to 5 missed calls. 

*""Help
*""Did you connect to the VPN like I showed you?""*
*""Oh
*""Did _they_ connect to the VPN like I showed you?""*
*""I don't know.""*
*""Ok... can you go get one of the machines and I'll talk you through it over the phone.""*

Which I then had to do. Four times.

This one was bitter sweet

**Backstory, so we tend to develop ~~report~~ rapport and learn the quirks of our customers.


In this case


""Hey Sawser

""Uh

""Well, we get around 300.""

So, they had roughly 85,000 individual transactions. Even better, they were roughly 10 cent payments, all to the same account.


A quick tutorial for those who aren't familiar with Credit Card merchants:
The merchant who takes your credit card generally pays a small flat rate per transaction, and if you negotiated your rates.
This school paid 9 cents + 2.75% per transaction. Which meant

This student paid their $10k tuition payment in ten cent increments, it *would have* gone to the processor, had they settled the batch containing those transactions. 


After a few days of additional research, so he wrote a bot to open up a few dozen windows and crank away making payments. He also told the university that Discover was having a promotion where for each payment he made, they entered him in a contest to win some big prize. I guess we can call that a win-win. The kicker? There wasn't any notices that bots weren't allowed, so he technically didn't abuse any of the systems and couldn't get in trouble.

We did write a script to refund all the transactions and put checks to make sure that multiple payments couldn't be made

In fact

**EDIT:** To avoid confusion - we wrote a script to cause our software to ~~issue the ~85k transactions refunds~~ void the ~85k transactions. Thus

In the end, and the student paid his full tuition with a single payment (275.09 dollars to the credit card processor, I imagine). 

There wasn't any harm done


**EDIT 2:** I'm going to add more technical detail since this got bigger and because there are a few posts regarding the legality of what happened. I didn't elaborate on this before for simplicity

Credit Card payments occur in two steps:

1. The credit card is authorized - this is to ensure the money exists in your account

2. The credit authorization is settled.  - this step removes the money from your account, your authorizations may not be settled for 2 or 3 days, depending on the settlement habits of the merchant you paid. 

In this case, but in commerce speak, the transactions were actually voided. Because they were 'voided' and not 'refunded' and no money changed hands, the school was in the clear. 

It is not my intention to get anyone into trouble or embarrass the school.

My boss figured out what I was doing and played along.  Her boss and facilities took the issue very seriously and were even talking about calling in the cops

Of course nobody had been.  Keep in mind that the user has reasserted several times that she doesn't know who has been doing the installs over the course of all of these meetins.  So I say that the only logical conclusion is that someone in the office must be doing it.  Now we call in HR because we might need to fire someone.

Finally the user breaks down and says that the installs may have been something that she did by accident.  Thing is that on top of all of the crappy tool bars etc.

It all started when I was asked to upgrade the laptop to Windows 7 with AutoCAD 2012. So I did a full backup and upgrade. The engineer comes back to me, Microsoft Greetings.

I discover it's incompatable with Windows 7 and actually breaks the OS and stops it from booting if you try to install it. So I recover Windows. Then I install Windows XP Mode

Hmm.. strange. I take a look and sure enough all the software I installed is gone.

So I reinstall it all. I took an educated guess that the engineer had accidentally uninstalled AutoCAD because he told me he ""installed"" it when I had already done so.

A week later. Same problem again.

He brings his laptop into the factory and I have another look at it

This happened many

At the time, they were a very, very decent company; good tools access for all the techs, our 'Tier2' at the time was all of 20' away in the cubicle farm and very affable to talk to.  Tours of our main datacenter were always available, and the kit they were using was top-notch.  On top of that, it was all very, very well documented.

We had a caller whom I'll call Phil.  Phil had a DSL line through us (with a backup/on the road dial-up account), if any scripting support).  It was rolled into a 'business-class' billing structure, of course; meaning that he paid a bit more and his webhost was on a slightly higher-end server from the ""5MiB Free"" server, and they gave an uptime guarntee on his DSL.  Pretty basic stuff.

Phil, nasty, and clueless in all things tech.  He'd also call for anything, multiple times.  I remember seeing a few items in the call logs for stuff like problems with various office equipment.  A good example was when he bought himself a flatbed scanner, and called us to help him with it.  I luckally didn't get one of those calls (somehow), but there was a good week straight where he'd call multiple times a day trying to get it to work; the ticket log would have ""Scanner Won't Work"" listed a good 100+ times, spanning a solid 10 days.

He was horribly abusive to other techs; women especially, calls with Phil.

I took a few calls from Phil, and still am, an extreme stickler for process flow of calls, staying inside support boundries, being exceptionally clear (and hitting the 'call record' button) when I stepped outside them that people wouldn't get this help here ever again.  Phil, of course, tried every opportunity to yell, cajole

My first call with Phil was a model for all further calls I personally had with him.

Me: Good afternoon, please?  
Phil: This is Phil.  
Me: Alrighty Phil
(Side note: I learned, I'll get it soon enough.  This makes callers feel that you're a human, and on their side.)  
Phil: I am trying to get the page you are hosting to connect to my printer and it won't connect!  What is wrong with your company
(I'm paraphrasing a bit here, and reason for his call to a tee.  I pressed the *call record button* at this point, which will backtrack and record the entire conversation)  
Me: Ok
Phil: I just told you what the problem is!  Weren't you listening?  What's wrong with you?  (and on
Me: I just like to be sure I'm helping you out as best I can.  You are having problems printing a webpage
Phil: Yes!  I can't print the webpage you are hosting on my new printer!  (Verbal contract established)  
Me: Ok.  We're not really able to help out with printer problems
Phil: Why can't you help me
Me: Sir, but I can help you make sure everything we do help with is working properly.  I've pulled up your account from Caller ID.  I see everything's in good standing, and I see no reported outages for your area.  Can you hold one moment while I verify the connections from my side?  
Phil:  Fine.  
Me: Thank you

Welcome to the penalty box, and see his modem as attached; physical layer is good.  Send a ping on the Data layer, fine.  Send a ping on network layer and don't get a response.  That's fine, firewall is in place.  I ask for the stats on that line, wait a minute, and ask again; they've gone up.  He's sending data over the line without any issue whatsoever; Golden.

I check his website; a Geocities-esque site selling various bric-a-brac.  Whatever, no problems there.

Phil's been in the penalty box for a good 5 minutes now

Me: Sorry about that, throwing in a few technical terms here and there.  
Phil: Uhh... (perfect.  I've gooed his little brain
Me: Since everything's working on this side

I walk him through opening up a webpage

Me: Now, your e-mail is working.  You stated, though, you're having problems printing; which is not something we support.  Who makes your printer?  
Phil: Umm... Hewlett Packard?  (he sounds unsure, my job is done)  
Me: Then
Phil: Yes

I gave him the phone number, attempted to call a few more times concerning the same issue, with varying degrees of illiciting the argument he wanted, but most techs were savvy enough to just pull his call record and ask him if it's the same issue; then why he's calling again about it, and off they went.

My boss later told me I was the only one who could 'stop' Phil when he called.

This went on for a few more weeks, at that point, to just give Phil my extension, and deny him service if he called on any other line.  If I wasn't in, he got my voicemail.

EDIT:

To clear up a few things and to give a rather disappointing answer to top comments there:

Software in question is basically for doing stats with, and using this thing to provide examples. As it turns out he didn't actually seem to think it was that important, it was mostly just some people in admin getting terribly excited about somthing they hadn't actually taken the time to understand. The iPad problem was solved neatly by emailing the presentation to himself and picking it up the mail on the machine that was already in the room, so as far as I know the lecture went fine. 

I don't really want to get into a big arguement about whether or not him being in our building and using our equipment makes him our user, I would have gone to see him earlier in the week since yes, that would have been easier for all concerned.

I let her know that she's going to need to calm down or else we aren't going to be able to get this working. She gets ahold of herself a bit, and that she may want to contact her ISP. At this point she angrily hangs up.

**Us**: He's actually in the same meeting.

**Reggie**: Fine! Have CEO call me as soon as he gets out

A quick word about our CEO. While he's on board with the leniency we have for late payments and is a very level-headed dude, we don't want to have to resort to that, since his clients actually are pretty decently sized and we'd prefer to not have this blow back on them too much. But Reginald keeps calling at least every hour, demanding that we pull CEO out of his very long and important meeting so he can convince him to make us magic his missing data.

We keep joking about it internally

He finally did end up accepting his fate, and no, we do not have a way to magically recover your not-important-enough-to-redundicize data.

After we went over the results, we marked the finding as a false-positive and gave it back to them.  This is the subsequent conversation between the auditors and we contractors:

**Auditor: ""OK

Contractors: ""Oh but we don't have Office on the server

**Auditor: ""Doesn't matter

Contractors: ""But we can't install the patch because Office isn't on the system.""

**Auditor: ""Then you need to install Office on it

Contractors: ""But that would just introduce a whole slew of new vulnerabilities

So, creates a ticket and hands the PC over to me, all the usual stuff. I do the standard diagnostics and, obviously, the HDD is dead: it doesn't even get recognized by the BIOS (no wonder it doesn't boot). I call the customer saying that he'll need a replacement of the HDD and ask whether we should attempt a data recovery off it (for an added price, of course), the customer insists we do everything in our power to retrieve the very important data stored on that drive.

I believe most of you know the trick with harddrives and freezers, failing within minutes of power-on and not allowing me to do a proper data recovery off it.

So here I was, when my eyes wandered over a few bricks laying in the corner - we used them as a deadweight to anchor our outdoors banner on windy days - suddenly the gears in my head sprung into motion and a wild idea appeared in my mind. I immediately grabbed one of them and shoved it into the freezer next to the failing HDD.

Next day first thing in the morning I took the drive and the brick out from the freezer, as well as to keep the moisture away from the electronic components, and started the drive imaging process. Approx. an hour later the imaging was done and the drive was successfully retired (i.e. put into a big box with the other fallen comrades). And the brick went back into the freezer, because you never know when you might need one again.

This is the first story of my 16 part saga of working at a local computer store from end 2006 to early 2009. I hope you will enjoy. I will try to get a new chapter out ~~monday~~. Let's make that next friday for you folks* 

**Please note that this story takes place in Germany

***

December 2006 was when I first started working at the local computer store. I remember it was a late friday afternoon and quite dark and stormy. My kind of weather. It was my first day

Days before the IT-administrator at my school found out I knew my way around computers and offered me a job at his “Business Partners” computer store. They had started it together back in the late 80’s. While he moved on to a full-time job as IT-administrator for many schools in the area

Though my mom told me when I was little not to accept any offers from strange people -and especially not from 40-something severely overweight Ron Jeremy look-a-likes - I took him up on the offer. My Nomad Zen

After he made a call with his, especially the intonation on the “Business Partner”-part, sounded like I was invited to do a casting couch audition for some B-grade porno site. Still to this day whenever somebody mentions a business partner I cringe and feel disgusted and violated.

After finishing up my homework at the school canteen that thursday I set off by bike to the computer store. It was located in one of the cheaper neighborhoods of our small city. The store − and all the stores surrounding it for that matter - much needed a new layer of paint and a good cleaning of the tiles and signs. Somewhat reluctantly I opened the door and walked into the store. No turning back now. I am greeted by my future co-worker Jeremy, leaving me in alone in the store. 

Looking around in the store I saw a lot of old damaged displays. Some obscure and mediocre burning software, had a huge cardboard display with a rather  B-grade category model printed on it praising the product. Most of the walls and tables were full of accessories. Mainly cheap Chinese and Koreans knock off brands, sold for Logitech and Microsoft hardware prices. A few PCs and displays with outdated component lined the walls and sold for absurd prices. The current generation computers were even more expensive.

The counter was made entirely of glass and was empty aside from the even older cash register and some USB-gadgets from questionable quality. The space under the counter hold a huge amount of games. This had to be the only shop where you could still buy every Doom game released for PC for the full launch price, anyway. 

Jeremy came back and told me I could walk to the back. I walked around the counter and almost broke my neck over the boxes full of non-branded memory. Stumbling into the back I almost bumped into the business partner. The top half of his shirt unbuttoned showing a rather disgusting orange-like forest of hair and a golden necklace. Like Ron he was severely - even morbidly - obese and was so large he could block your path. Looking up at him I saw a disgusting smile

He showed me a seat and and they took their places opposite me. Jeremy shouted from the front of the store he was leaving and I heard the front door slam shut. Looking back at the two obese figures in front of me

Ron starts talking about how he liked my work at school and thinks I can help Don with the store during nights and weekends. Don

The first test he gave me was installing Windows XP on one of the “new” machines for a customer and making sure all the hardware drivers were installed. Nothing special in this regard

The third and final assignment was supposed to get make me go running out of the store pulling my hair. But really at this point no difficult assignment was needed to get me to do this.

I had to configure a Debian linux installation to run a cron task, but we will teach you the skills girl” Don quickly added. I felt even more uncomfortable now. After some 25 minutes the third task was completed and they congratulated me with passing the tests.

A standard 3 month contract quickly got grabbed from one of their desks and my details filled in. My pay would by around $5 dollars, friday, straight out of school from 17:00 till 21:00. 

* * *

I was to begin my first shift today. Jeremy was to be my mentor for the day. After changing into the way to small  company t-shirt he sat me down and told me what I was supposed to do. It would have been quicker if he told me what I was not supposed to do. I had to help customers, clean the shop, work the register, answer the phone and repair the PCs brought in by our customers. Basically everything you can do in a shop.

He showed me how the cash register worked

When we came to the back things became rather interesting. I already seen the back of the store

The binders of cd’s were full of cracked software ranging from all version of Windows and Office to every version of Photoshop and Norton Ghost. The only genuine software was the burning software that stood prominently in the store, failed businessmen and seniors, our usual mix of customers, buying a new overpriced PC.

The network drive had even more illegal software

My shift ended pretty quickly and was nothing special in that regard. My next shifts for over 2 years would be.

***

**TL:DR** - I got a job at a the local shady computer store with Ron Jeremy and the love child of Donald Trump and Fat Bastard as my bosses. Ron and Don. Sexual harassment is our selling point in the store.

One such job was working for the (at the time) biggest consumer electronics chain in New Zealand

Store policy was that any upgrades such as RAM was at the discretion of the employee, and we weren't busy, then why not, go for it.

One Saturday afternoon, but he insisted, and it shouldn't have taken that long anyway... 

So I popped the cover off on the bottom and identified the correct type

Put the new RAM in and tried to boot the machine. No go. Battery flat. Does the customer have the charger? Of course not

I had a nice relaxing day off on the Sunday.

Come Monday, and there was honestly no way I had done any such thing. I suggested that sometimes a dud stick of RAM could prevent the machine from booting, it fell on deaf ears. I invited him to come into the store and we could troubleshoot to find the problem, this time perhaps could he bring his charger so we can verify it works before he leaves the store? Of course not.

So my store manager had me drive into the city (about 15km) with my own car on company time (she did give me a petrol voucher after the fact) with cash to refund him (last resort) and 2 of every type of RAM we carried

I opened up the bottom of the laptop and pointed out there were 2 covers

We had a task for our intern one day: to take some backup tapes out from the server room across the street. He may have done so begrudgingly, as we know our intern was a bit on the lazy side.

I was working on the servers across the street, and mouse hooked up on a KVM switch was displaying porn sites on it.

I motioned our manager to come see my screen and asked him what course of action we should take next as I let him drive on my workstation.

1355945141.0,154fzp,Surveillance system just has a bug or two,photopteryx,1226,231,61,"I worked for a while at a retail business that sold plants. It was a small operation, a front counter, and our 4-camera

You might wonder why such a small operation employed such seemingly unnecessary methods simply for keeping an eye on things, infrared, closed-circuit, DVR surveillance system. It got the job done, as overkill often does.

Now

The DVR and TV monitor for our camera system resided in the ""seed storage"" room. So, of past nights. One afternoon as we're closing up shop, I look into the room and see that someone has been cleaning Gaillardia seed heads to harvest the seeds. The scene resembles [this fine image that I stole from the internet](http://blackfootnativeplants.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/gaiari-seeds-web.jpg). Apparently they hadn't finished, but that's fine because nobody will be in here overnight to mess with it.

The next morning, in fact. Not a seed left. I confirm with the other employees that neither of them had come in overnight to work on these seeds.

""Maybe they blew off the table somehow?"" A reasonable enough suggestion, though ridiculously unlikely, someone had entered the office and stolen our really abundant and not-all-that-valuable seeds. Fortunately, we have a four-camera, infrared, closed-circuit, DVR surveillance system! With it being a slow day that day, and perhaps determine who came in and what else they may have left with. We kept a channel on live footage of outside in case we saw a stray customer.

So, the non-events of the previous night. No person entered or exited the premises save ourselves at the already established times. We had a genuine mystery of missing seeds, and at that point it was way more about the novelty of the situation than regard for actual loss of property. It was then when I made a breakthrough discovery...

When I reached up to switch the DVR back to displaying live feed on all its channels, actually.  But those somethings were moving. To my keen eye, these appeared to be the antennae of hundreds of rather large ants that had squeezed themselves into the DVR unit through the vents and perhaps have made a new home inside. And I decided that if they were making a home, they probably needed building materials. It hardly takes a Sherlockian leap of logic to tie the two tales together. Our stolen seeds were stashed away in the very security device design to prevent thefts! I laughed at the irony of it, and the other employees then gave me funny looks. So, in lieu of verbal explanation, I unplugged the DVR from its cameras and TV, and gently carried the box outside.

I unscrewed the shell of the unit from its base and peeled off the **Warranty Void If Broken** sticker sealing the gap between the two (shh

I left the DVR outside for a couple hours and let the ants extract themselves from our electronics

Then came the day when I found out just how wrong I was.

Through the headphones came an angry customer who was bitching and swearing at me that our internet service was too fast.   He was actually demanding that we slow down his new cable internet service.

My brains nearly fell out of my ears. Wait... TOO FAST?  

The guy then launched into a rant that we owed him a new monitor too.

Uhhhhhhhh....  ooooookaaaayyyy....

Somehow I managed to calm him down long enough to actually explain the situation.   He angrily explained to me that 3 days after his new internet connection was installed

And dammit

I spent 20 minutes trying somehow to get through to this guy that the one had nothing to do with the other.   Didn't work.

My mom comes upstairs and tells me that her best friend's daughter just got a new ipod, and my godchild, we've got thousands of songs, and 99% of the stuff most 12 year olds typically listen to.  So I told my mom to have her give me a list of a couple hundred songs or so, and I'd load up as many as I could.  Sounds simple, right?  Should only take a few minutes or so, right?  

Wrong.  

About a week passes, really long list.  Just over 250 songs.  So I proceed to take the envelope upstairs and begin my work.  I look at the list......and see the most racist, offensive, hateful songs I have ever seen -- mostly involving extreme hardcore rap.  I'd say about 90% of the songs are not appropriate for 12 year old girls.  

So I bring the list downstairs and show my mom

As a result

This may sound a bit odd, and nobody in my small circle of friends had one.  So I spent a couple of minutes fumbling around, half trying to figure out how it worked, and half out of the usual ""what does this do?"" curiosity that comes with a new device.  That's when I stumbled across her pictures.   And that's when shit went downhill.  Fast.

The very first picture that loaded up was a picture of her, or do I call her dad?   Could this girl be being abused, or is she just doing some harmless experimenting?  If I call her dad and she's being abused, I make the problem worse.  If I call the cops and this is just a case of a 12 year old exploring her body, I could throw the entire family into unimaginable hell for nothing.  

I call my wife over and she looks at the picture.  ""Does she own a laptop or a webcam?"".  ""No"", because she's got both hands on her chest, which means someone else is working that camera.""  Fuck.  She's right.

In a (probably misguided) effort to try to figure out what was going on, but also contained pictures of herself making out, topless, with a 13 year old boy, taken at the same time.  So at least we knew who the mystery photographer was, along with knowing the reason behind the pictures' existence.

But now here's the situation -- I've got to explain to Pat and her husband that her daughter's ipod contains pictures of their 12 year old daughter naked with (and possibly screwing) a 13 year old boy.   There is really no good way to explain this to anyone

So I go downstairs and wake my mom up.  ""Just come upstars

My mom almost had a heart attack when she saw the pictures.  She rushes downstairs, but isn't doing a very good job.  Unknown to me, Pat hands the phone to her husband so she can go and confront her daughter.  My mom then hands me the phone.  Here I am thinking I'm talking to Pat, when I'm now stuck trying to explain to her husband what's going on.  Needless to say, this was the most awkward conversation I have ever had in my life.  

I explain exactly what's on the ipod to an increasingly furious John.  Outside of the occasional ""mmm-hmm"", with an obviously sulking daughter in the back seat.  I explain to John:  ""Are you sure you want to see this?  They're pretty graphic, and what you see you can't unsee"".  He looked at the first picture for about 1/8th of a second before turning away and saying ""Ok, I've seen enough.  Thanks.  I'm on my way to the boy's house next.""  I can only imagine how *that* conversation went.

what I found.

He hadn't just forwarded the E-mail like I'd asked. No; that would have been too simple.

Instead he'd printed the original email off. He'd then taken that printed email and scanned it back onto the computer and 
saved it as a PDF. He then attached this PDF to another email and sent it to me.

How does this even process in someones brain? In what world does it make sense to print something OFF the computer and then 
scan it back ON?

Oh, I get very, VERY worried very quickly. Sure enough, my suspicions were warranted.

""I could be better

""Well, can you take a look?""

I hit mute on the phone and opened up the 4U case under my desk with a pair of old P4 Xeons and a SuperMicro board in it. However, and after a swig of the wonderful elixir (which purged by fire the invectives that were pooling up in my mouth), I unmuted her and continued.

""Okay. I'm going to send you a quote. You're going to approve it, you can't do secure remote desktop.""

""A server? Those are expensive! We were going to do GoToMyPC on their computers and then let our temps use their computers while they're not at the office so we don't have to buy new machines. Can't you do it without buying a server?""

My eye twitched

""We have to account for security, GoToMyPC will take up the machine when it's in use. Your temps won't be able to do anything with the machines, and you'll need new ones as is. Seriously, you really need to have a proper server for this. On a not entirely unrelated note, did you read the e-mail I sent you about the echocardiogram storage requirements? Storing a year of ECGs on a single non-RAID'd hard drive is just asking for disaster.""

""Well, and sometimes GoToMyPC just isn't fast enough!""

""MXX, WHEN - you suffer data loss. You're disregarding the advice of people who've seen everything, and we've offered to build you a storage server for them for months, but you've turned us down on a cost basis. What's cheaper - a server and maintenance, or a data loss incident under HIPAA?""

After a bit of negotiation, and this was a few months after the flood in Thailand, so drives were insanely expensive). I specced out a cheap little TS box - hardware and licensing, plus Office Enterprise licenses, came out to about three grand US.

A few days later, set up everything, and drove it the hundred miles to their office to set it up at the end of a day.

**END USERS WILL BE ENDED**

I pulled up to their main clinic around seven or eight
And I yelled to the cabby - 

Wait, I took the server inside and unlocked the comms closet, then stared in disbelief at the contents.

My previously-pristine comms closet was covered in boxes of crap like old phones

I made room for the server, I did my normal checks on the already-in-place server, saw that everything was good - the SQL database was backing up properly, nothing foul was in the error logs, the usual.

After that, rail-thin, cocksure of herself, refuses to take no for an answer, the kind of soccer mom you just love to hate.

""Look, and your users can log in remotely from anywhere. They have EMR access, Office, printer access, they can fax out from your giant MFD, the whole nine yards. My question is this - where did the laptops go? I quoted two out on the Premier quote, but they weren't there with the server.""

""Oh, the techs said they'd bring their personal laptops and they could use those! And the doctor's going to use his iPad, too, so we don't need anything for him.""

""... right, so he would go crazy trying to use the thing over remote desktop. We went over that before when he tried it with LogMeIn to his desktop and the studies. Two: their personal laptops aren't under warranty, I'm not going to drive 100 miles each way to fix them when they break and can't work. That's why we buy Derp, because the hardware can be replaced next business day without me needing to be here. Three: you didn't upgrade your Internet tier like I asked. I'd asked you to get a static IP and to go to 30 down and 10 up, and Speedtest said today that you're at 8 down and 512K up. If you don't make the call, I'll do it, since you put me on as technical contact on the account last week. I'm going to do my regular support checks on the workstations here, I'll be driving back to Austin.""

The clinic closed down while I was checking each machine

Everything checked out okay, along with the results of all my scans and checks, that she needed to get the storage server ASAP. At that point, I buggered off to Austin, and fell asleep with the sleep of the just.

**OF COURSE

Two days later

Not my office cell

Blearily

""Our entire network is down! Your new server broke the network and we can't see any patients!""

After answering that nothing I did could have caused it, and drove the hundred miles to her office, after calling my boss to let him know that I had an emergency there that day.

I was greeted there with the sight of the staff lounging around, calling me the ""best tech ever"" and the only hope for the office.

I would have gone Biblical on this - as in Sodom and Gomorrah, and the whole thing about finding one good person and sparing everyone came into play. As I gratefully accepted it and took a sip, my anger mellowed, and I plugged my laptop into the network to try to get things working.

DHCP wasn't handing out addresses, why is there a network named NETGEAR...

NETGEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR

I loaded up a spectrum analyzer and started tracing the access point. Sure enough

Confronting the user in front of the practice manager led to more rage - ""well, so I plugged this in, but it didn't work, and nothing seemed wrong, so yeah.""

The practice manager piped up, since all we needed was a wireless router, that's what the guy at Derp Squad said.""

""Don't. Do. This."" I turned to the practice manager. ""If you want wireless, my boss finds out about it. He's said that he's fired clients for that before. Meanwhile, I'm calling Slime Warner and upgrading your connection like I said we needed.""

I turned to her on the way out of her office.

""Oh

By the end of the day, and TW had upped their connection to something usable. I drove back to Austin, and crashed hard again.

1361707705.0,194ooh,Pulling someone out of the fire and promptly shoving them back in.,MoeFuggah,1163,207,225,"I was working for a company that dispatches techs for onsite support and they cover a wide service radius  of 8+ cities.   

The company has an excellent reputation and quite a bit of business. (wasn't uncommon to run 6+ dispatches a day)  

You would call the office

So I'm scheduled for 5 dispatches that day.  I get a call from the office wanting to know if I can fit in a sixth. ( I was paid commission so of course!)

So I sync to the dispatch board and find out the last appointment is scheduled for ASAP (something we usually don't do) since he did not want to pay the premium. (red flag #1) 

The dispatch explains that there are 5 more ahead of him and I will call as soon as possible.

So every hour on the hour I'm getting a message from the office wanting to know my status. The guy keeps calling wanting to know if I'm going to show up or not. (Red flag #2)

So I plow through my tickets and call him at 3 in the afternoon and let him know it will take me 45 minutes to drive from Whitewater to Indio in afternoon traffic and I am on my way
   
I arrive on site a... convenience store -- we will call them pm/am. 

I brief the guy and its pretty simple

 Turns out the guy is what you would call green.  He decided to reset the router he jacked the DVR into thinking it would make everything work... taking out pretty much every payment option except cash... ATM EBT

I ask him why didn't the In house IT take care of this for him since its a corporate network. (Red flag #5)   He has no documentation or authority to do anything with the network since he is a contractor and there's no manager there and he doesn't want anyone to know what he's done.
So I take pity on the guy and call the ISP and get the router back online, but the DVR only worked with Iphone then ask him for payment.

 He's telling me I haven't done the work since he can't see it on his phone.  I explain to the guy I'm sorry but LG phones aren't supported for the web access
 
  After a call to the boss to fill him in with what was going on he tells me no good deed goes unpunished and to do what I feel.

I give him 4 options. Pay me, format the DVR back to factory settings and let him explain to the store manager that he's killed the profits for the day as well as the network and take a wash.    

I packed up my laptop and notes

His reply was ""I called you at 10 this morning and you didn't show up until 4! then you take 4 hours to do it! I can't see it on my phone so you aren't finished and you expect me to pay you almost 450$?""

At this time it's not about the money

 So I reset the router  borking the network again and he's right back where he started in the hot seat. The look on his face was well worth it.

 On the way out of the store the clerks ask if the payments are down again and I politely tell them unfortunately our friend her doesn't want to pay me so I'm leaving everything the way I found it and they will have to deal with telling the customers it's cash only and I'm sorry.

On my way out the door I notice that the store manager's number is on the front of the store and called him on my drive home

I did the first thing that came to mind : empty the recycle bin! 5gb of space! Check other things (find why the disk was full).

Later that day, they would get everything out and place it in the shared folders.

I was shocked. I was trying not to laugh at the phone. She then asked me to get the files from the backup and I tell her that we don't take the Recycle Bin in our backup (they have limited storage). After much arguments

I talked to her boss and we finally sent someone to explain to those ladies how to share documents without using the Recycle Bin.

1361776676.0,196jj4,Firing the Client.,MoeFuggah,1168,220,234,"So I start my own shop and offer your choice of onsite or drop off. Drop off is cheaper.

I have a couple bring me their desktop we will call Dick and Jane. I usually do the diagnosis before you leave and have you sign the all the necessary paperwork before I touch anything. 

After taking 10 minutes to do a hardware diagnostic everything tests out fine. XP takes another 15 to get to a desktop. The drive isn't jam packed so its not the page file it's obviously a bad infestation. The honorable thing to do is nuke/reroll for a flat fee since something that dirty will run up an hourly bill pretty quickly.

Dick and Jane sign off and away I go. 

So I roll the machine up patch updated installed drivers and AV and configure for best performance. More or less true barebones. No shovelware no unnecessary programs. 

Call Dick and Jane and tell them to come and get their machine it's ready. They are pleased it was finished in the same day and gladly paid signed off and left happy as clams.

I'm thinking great another satisfied customer who will spread the good word.

Fast forward two weeks later.....I get a phone call from Jane ""This machines doing exactly what it was doing before and I want it fixed again under warranty"" 

Now good children I do not offer any kind of warranty unless it comes from new hardware manufacturer and it even says so in the paperwork since there is no telling what they have installed or picked up off the interwebs but I do believe in standing behind my work.

So I tell her ma'am I'll gladly take a look. Bring it by and if it's something I have overlooked I will be glad to take care of the problem however if it's not my fault you will still have to pay me for the diagnostic and decide if you want me to repair it for you again. 

Here comes Dick and Jane a second time. 

Again the hardware is fine and I'm getting long boot times so obviously it's something they have done

After explaining that I have to charge the diagnostic fee and it's up to them to decide if they want it fixed again

Dick is obstinate to the fact that he couldn't have done anything to mess up the machine and he shouldn't have to pay since he knows how to use a computer and Jane says go ahead she wants to know what's going on. 

So one of the first things I find is registry mechanic installed on the task bar and programs list. You know the so called Speed up/Optimize your machine software that is really masked malware. But good Reddit I'm obviously preaching to the choir here about the effects of such things. 

I politely explain to Jane that the malware was installed by someone voluntarily more than likely thinking it was a good program and give the ""Free click here are the most dangerous words on the internet"" sermon as I already optimize the config before it leaves the shop as part of my OS reload service. 

However

Dick at this point is flushed and Jane flatly says that this should be covered by warranty seeing as my build allowed something to infect her machine and that my antivirus didn't work yaddah yaddah. 

So I pull out the paperwork and show her that there is no implied warranty on the operating system but there is on hardware if any is purchased. And explain that no antivirus is perfect if it were there would be no viruses on the internet.

I launch IE to check windows update just to make sure its completely patched and behold the browsers hijacked to some free meet women stuff you see all over the internet.

This clues me into someone surfing pr0n. So I check the cookie cache and lo and behold its chock full of cookies from pr0n sites and state that the dirtiest places on the internet are these kind of sites. Dick is red faced and Jane's pissed seeing as the timestamps are when she's at work (LOL). 

Dick decides it's time to go and he's NOT PAYING ME FOR ANYTHING and Jane's pissed at Dick for obvious reasons. But he still thinks she shouldn't Have to pay me a dime even for the diagnostic. 

Well I don't touch a machine before the paperwork is signed. EVER. And tell them I will be holding their equipment until the diagnostic is paid. ( I Have paperwork signed agreeing to this)

He say's that my paperwork doesn't mean shit and tells me they are taking his machine and leaving so I simply say if you touch the machine and I don't have my money expect the police to come knocking on your door for theft of service and robbery after calling in the tag on your car. 

He's looking like he's ready to rip my head off. She's looking at him like she's ready to rip his head off and I show them the sign on the wall showing that machines left on open invoice after 30 days will be sold to cover any outstanding balance and they storm off.

An hour later they come back with my money and I send them on their merry way and thank them for their business but I'm not interested in doing anymore work for them.

~ ~ ~ *Wavy lines to indicate the backward journey in time* ~ ~ ~

Many, in the fuel bar section.  At the end of each shift, we would tally up the sales and count the cash, and enter all the data into an Excel spreadsheet.  One of the glories of being a 'shift boss' was that it was your responsibility to balance the shift.

I had been a grunt for awhile pumping fuel; then a shift boss.  I then worked my way up to managing the place.  It was a 24-hour business, etc at the end of my shift.

One evening, when I got a call on my cell phone.  No one ever calls me on my cell phone unless its a work emergency.  So I answer the phone, and the guy who was working in the fuel bar starts rattling in my ear. ""The computer's broken ohmygodidon'tknowwhattodocan you heeeellp!""

I turned to the CCTV

""What's the problem?""  I ask.  I can hear a steady beeping sound in the background.

""I don't know what happened

It dawns on me that he doesn't realise I'm still on site, exactly what's causing the issue.

""You're seriously going to make me come back to work? Is it really that big a deal?""

He was practically in tears. ""Pleeeeeeease

""I've already had a few beers,""  I lied.

""Oh shit

""Relax

""Thanks buddy

I decided I would let him sweat for a few minutes.  I finished off my deposit homework, being careful to lock the door behind me.

I then strolled over to the fuel bar, panting heavily.

My colleague looked at me in shock - we had spoken only about three minutes ago

""I broke the speed limit getting here.  This better be good

I went to college for CE/CS, but was available after 5pm for pretty much anything that wasn't against university policy or international law.  This normally meant ""play Starcraft and Quake II until your eyes bled"", after which we would go play in the reflecting pond until the campus police chased us away.  Yeah, honors kids are weird.

The other key event in 1998 was the appearance of [NetBus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBus).  Originally designed to be a malicious backdoor program

One fateful night, computers would alt-tab to the desktop (freezing the game) and random web sites would open up in the browser.  It wasn't just one computer, it was happening to pretty much every computer in the lab.  At first everyone thought it was a virus, but since I had some experience with NetBus a little lightbulb went off in my head.  I pulled up a command prompt on one of the misbehaving computers to run netstat; sure enough there were telltale signs of NetBus running, such as open ports (12345) and connections on odd high ports.  Whoever was controlling NetBus saw what I was doing; they closed the command prompt and opened up ""netstat.net"" in the browser to show that he was watching.  I unplugged the network cable, dumped the netstat output to a text file, and contacted the ISP where the connections originated.

I get a terse ""we took care of the problem"" response from the ISP the next day and shrugged it off

Apparently the guy in my classes was the one who installed NetBus on the lab computers as a joke.  He worked at the ISP where the connections originated

My favorite task soon became the initial visit to create the cost estimate.  I had some neat software on my laptop with which I could map out all the devices on the LAN.  I'd then make a physical map of the network layout
 
As I walked into this exceedingly ordinary law office in 2007 I was greeted by a receptionist who might have been pretty some 10, discolored CRT monitor sitting atop an old discolored tower.  It was covered with sticky notes with various web sites along with the username / password for each.  [sigh] It was going to be one of those jobs.  I explained who I was to which she replied ""So you're our new tech this month, huh?  OK, let's go meet Mr. (Head Lawyer)""  Not a good start. 
 
As we went down the hallway I glanced into each office seeing people working but not using their PCs.  This struck me as unusual.  Each PC was as old as the one used by the receptionist.  At the end of the hall were 5 or 6 larger offices
 
Another lawyer read my mind and silently moved to block my exit.  ""I'm glad you're here.  We have lots of computer problems and the last tech was not able to do much to help.""  I was outnumbered and flanked.  Might as well take a look around before I flee.  I said ""I'd like to start in your network closet.  Show me where you keep all the network stuff.""  This question prompted some polite, thanks.  Let's start there. 
 
Calling it a server room was a bit of an overstatement.  I was expecting a closet, and a power strip.  Attached to that hub were three network cables - one went into the wall on the right, the other to the left.  The third went to the server.  While I'm taking this in, Head Lawyer proudly said:  ""Some years ago I upgraded this office myself from the old coaxial ring to these new ethernet cables.  We were the first business around here to have a network.""  Coaxial rings... I vaguely recall reading about token ring networks.  They were literally arranged in a ring weren't they?  I only started doing this about 1999 so this was all ancient history to me. 
 
I plugged in my laptop and didn't get an IP address.  I asked where the router was, everybody had static IPs.  The printers were old, the server didn't work (never even learned what it was for), the internet didn't work, it was a mess.  The last office I visited connected back into the ""server room"" making a complete ring.  Wow. 
 
I decided I didn't really want the job so I was going to tell Head Lawyer the truth, everything in these offices that runs on electricity whose primary purpose is not to provide lighting needs to be replaced.  No exceptions.""  He frowned and told me the last tech pretty much said the same thing.  ""Listen"" he said, ""the girls here are used to Windows 98, let's keep it like it is.  Just fix it.""  I told him this was not a traditional network layout and I was not willing to support it.  ""I wish you the best of luck in finding somebody who can support this.  I would love to replace all this for you and build you a modern setup, but I can't do it and keep anything you currently have.""

Our office has That Guy. That Guy who walks around the office, or how the gub'mint is squelching his freedom to own guns, or how people these days aren't as wholesome as they were ""before"". I'll call him Bob. Bob, a salesperson, is an aggressive conversationalist who often traps people without escape for up to 2 hours. It's kind of his job, but the rest of us wish he didn't do it to us. While I feel no compunction in brusquely telling him to fuck off, the rest of the office is less confrontational and usually surrenders to his blathering until someone takes pity and pulls the hapless victim into a ""meeting"". The employees all agreed: something had to be done. IT (well, and the extreme rescue dialer was born.


When a victim is trapped by Bob, can trigger the rescue system by discreetly visiting a webpage. This will cause a phone call to ring Bob's desk phone, and he will drop everything to sprint back to it, giving the victim time to escape to the bathroom or lock their door. Since Bob is a salesperson who often does B2B cold calls and leaves messages, he is always hoping for callbacks - his face just lights up with glee when he ""gets one"". The system spoofs its caller ID to a different number each time, so he doesn't figure it out. To further avoid discovery, the system waits for him to pick up and say hello, then hangs up. Bob will excitedly try to call back several times thinking he has a hot lead. However


The rescue dial system has been a rousing success. Cruel? Perhaps. Hilarious? Definitely. Since we have to use it so often, even though several people in the office were personal friends with him for years before the company even started...

There was one girl who lives in America I'd met on a forum and had added on Skype/Twitter/etc. and she knew I was quite good at general PC troubleshooting

Cassie sends me a message asking if I could look at a problem her friend in Australia was having and linked me to a tweet he had made to a blog post detailing how his PC was no longer booting. Quite a convoluted way to get details of a problem I know. I read through the post which explained the following (in a little bit more detail):

 - Windows crashed the day before and would not boot  
 - When turning on the PC it would get to the Windows flag and then loop  
 - The PC **did** boot into safemode but neither the mouse or keyboard would work at all

Now a few people were giving their tidbits of advice saying that it was clearly a failed hard drive and he needed to re-format the whole thing

It was about here that the friend

True enough he gets into safemode without a hitch and can use the keyboard perfectly. I then ask him to try Windows as normal and then plug in the keyboard to the back panel and try again if that's successful as well. Works both times. He's very excited at this point. I tell him to take it easy as it may mean that one of his devices (two of which were external HDDs filled with videos he had created for his YouTube) was at fault. He needed to plug them in one at a time so we can know which it is.

Thankfully once everything was in it was all working perfectly. I put that down to the driver/device in question having been put back in a different port and resolved whatever driver issue that had afflicted it.

Ozzie was thrilled and spammed his thanks to me. I checked what time his blog post went up and it was about 55 minutes before I produced the solution for him.

So a few years back, this was right after the economy imploded, so things were scarce (the massive global financial company where I'd interned in IT was still in a hiring freeze, but that's a different story). Adding to the issue, was the fact that I wanted to do get more into the programming side of things as opposed to support, but almost all of my previous experience was in support. So finding jobs was, shall we say

In my desperation, I'd come to a narrow doorway in between two Chinatown knockoff shops, with a rickety elevator. Wary, but undeterred, I gave it a shot, hoping to avoid getting mugged on the way there. Getting off at the floor I was directed to, I was surprised to find it completely renovated, glass doors, I walked on.

During the interview, so we struck a deal: I'd work for $5k less than the advertised salary, and I'd get bumped up to it if they were happy with my work upon my review 3 months in. In retrospect, I should've got that in writing. But they signed me up and I began coming in.

The job itself was going to be building landing pages for ad campaigns and doing some light IT support around the office. When I started, and who they obviously intended to replace with me doing occasional support work and part time programming. I felt this was *not cool*, but I needed the job.

I was disappointed to find that, with a form asking for your personal information that they **promise** will be kept confidential (hint: they resell it).

The job was made difficult due to the fact that everyone was running old eMachines running single core Celerons with about 1 gig of RAM (this was 2 years ago, resulting in hours on the phone with Verizon and having the boss yell at all of us as if it were our fault they were too cheap to upgrade to a proper business class connection.

There were also rumblings. You see, despite the company being 3 years old. Legend had it that the entire former staff and up and walked out one day. Hard to believe, as the economy would've already been bad by then, but management's paranoia seemed to reinforce these things. At one point, while they were at a convention, my coworkers insisted that they had listening devices around the office and were eavesdropping on us, because one of them made a comment about something someone said to themselves while alone in the office late one night. They gave me this warning written on a piece of paper, mail was monitored, plus a low salary and a grand total of 8 days off a year! Did I mention that we were sometimes required to work from remotely from home... on weekends?

*****
# **A Not So Secret Code**

Anyway, and in my off time I began helping out a coworker whose sole job was to run reports. Massive reports he'd spend hours on, pulling in data for a dozen sources to try to figure out how much money we should be making compared to what we got paid, and how much we should pay out. It was incredibly tedious and frustrating, and I figured hell, what are programmers for other than to turn the tedious and frustrating into something quick and easy? 

So I automated some data calls for him, with no batch decryption available. I stared at it frustrated... and noticed a pattern. Sitting down with a pen and paper on my lunch break, I figured out that the encryption was actually 3 sets of encryption algorithms that substituted numbers for sets of letters, with a delimiter in between number sets, and a key appended at the end representing the encryption scheme. Made a bulk decoder for it, and was proud to realize it worked, and that I'd actually just decrypted something off the top of my head with some guess work, to taking about half an hour. 

My only concern was that to do all of this I needed to use a user's credentials. For testing I used my own before asking my boss for an account for tools I built. She shrugged it off
&gt;""No and that's final

Of course, I'd warned her. Other tools followed piggy backing on this which would literally cut out work by days every week, freeing us to do more useful work, and productivity soared.

# **The Lithuanian Word for Hell**

I did similar automation for our newsletters, to this day, never seen such a nightmare. They were written by a Lithuanian programmer who learned to program as he went along. The first 3 sections had no functions. All the code was copy-pasted and duplicated for reuse. There were also no comments, no proper indentation, no includes to break up the code into chunks, nothing. Also, the variables were Lithuanian words abbreviated, some of the 3 or 4 letter abbreviated variables differed by a single letter or swapped letters

You could clearly trace the path where he learned about things. Like one page stored the date in the db as a Date object in SQL, 01-10-10, 01-11-09, etc). I figured if I could decrypt something offhand, I can figure this out... and I mostly did, albeit painfully, tracing every single variable manually, and added a proper per user permissions system for the tools that was granular and easy to use. And of course, after double checking with the CTO again that we weren't making a separate account for it.

# **The Hammer Drops**

Eventually

&gt;""Hey, and the mood changed. 

&gt;""Oh, you'd get health benefits. Those are worth about three thousand per person.""

&gt;""But you said the job had an $x salary and benefits. Even assume you're including benefits

&gt;""No

Needless to say that I was not happy, and worked so late that I barely had enough time or energy to do actively look. It was around this time that a lot of template work began really coming in. It was mostly for those for-profit online ""universities,"" some of which can be rather shady, and they had massive forms (University of Phoenix alone had thousands of interdependent items in dropdown menus) and short deadlines. Additionally, a bunch of the tools I'd built pointed to fraudulent data being passed, which my boss made my number one priority to weed out daily. 

At this point my job became largely mind numbing data entry. I offered to try to automate removing fraudulent data with an algorithm, and which builds the form processor. It had some serious bugs in it, and I'd offered to help fix it countless times, but was never given access, and informed that it was strictly maintained by a contractor, who works off-site, and who I wasn't allowed to speak to. When I dug up his info from a carelessly forwarded email from my boss to me, I got yelled at by management. 

&gt;""You don't seem to understand

Of course, but said nothing. The job had just become mind numbingly depressing, by then, and I was too drained and demoralized to find a better job.

We'd had a turnover rate of one person a month since I'd been hired, by this point. And every single one of my coworkers hated working there, myself included.

# **The Other Shoe**

There's always a breaking point. For me, 3 weeks in advance, to take her to the hospital for thyroid surgery. It was approved, we went, and she made it through ok and is now much better. But it set into motion the end of my employment there.

You see, that I'd be excited to work for, and asked for a day off under the guise of a doctor's checkup, to go to the interview. I was called into the management office, and proceeded to get chewed out for, I'm not making this up, 3 hours (the CEO was one of those people who legitimately enjoyed yelling at people at the top of her lungs). They complained that my attitude had become negative (no shit), that I'd been consistently 10 minutes late to work for the past 3 months (starting right after my review), citing that I'd ""... already taken plenty of days off recently."" Now, planned in advance

It was at that moment that I decided that I was done.

*****
# **Fallout

The day I'd asked off for finally rolled around

I went to the interview

It was at this point that my phone alerted me that my email account was offline. Figuring that they'd decided to ""punish"" me by firing me with no one to replace me

I woke up 2 hours later, since, like I told them months earlier, they were all using my account credentials for their hooks. Truth be told, even I'd forgotten all about it till that point. Authentications for automated processes failed across the board, destroying their ability to monitor their income based on traffic reports, which was problematic, who was the only one other than me who knew how to assemble those up by hand. The entire company came screeching to a halt. And since no one else knew how to code

My coworker called to inform me that the bosses had been screaming at one another in their office for over 2 hours

The company survived, though I don't know the details of it. My coworker found a new job shortly afterward and that was my last contact at the company. With the looming specter of my mortgage looming over me, I lived off of my savings, and I'd managed to find a new job about 3 weeks after leaving, for better pay, salary, environment, and benefits, I have a story that I tell them...

Recap. The user had bought a 100mm stage.  It was *physically incapable* of 200mm movement

So my program worked perfectly and loaded the drivers it was told to

Fixed by simply copying over my config file (since the idiot had overwritten his).  No thanks

The year was 2008. I was driving a black-and-white VW for the poor bastards who got ruined by the blueshirts. My day was 11 AM to 7 PM, comfortable areas of town, basically places where I blended in easily thanks to my upbringing (private schools, Boy Scouts, et cetera). These places had clients who were mostly pretty good - intelligent, very good conversationalists, quick learners

Mind you, and WELL after the [vodka-barf keyboard](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/158prt/sloshed_simpleton_spews_sickening_slush_on_system/).

BUT I DIGRESS.

It was near the end of my day that day. I'd set up a few wireless networks for users in their houses, for a client who I would have sworn I'd seen before. It turned out I had, which I found out when I pulled the logs for him in our scheduling system, but I didn't recognize him offhand.

I did, and I thought *Oh no, not this guy again.* Seeing the house, which was in the Memorial section of town (a rich old-money part of Houston, or, as Tycho and Gabe say, ""Rich Mofo Street""), and I shuddered and went to work.

I knocked on the door, I figured out the BSODs he'd been having weren't software based (as much as I'd have liked to blame AOL dial-up for it - and yes, it was on his system - I couldn't). Virus scans came up negative, too.

Meanwhile, it was some execrable *blend* (so sue me, I'm a whiskey purist, and my premier stock is older than my fiancee, which means that either like Tuxedo Mask, I like the young stuff, or I have *excellent* taste in whiskey. It's the latter. I went for the cheap pedo shot to get a laugh. LAUGH DAMN YOU).

I ran hardware diagnostics, and before I had a chance to explain it to him, he started ranting about me taking too long to repair the machine. One of the lines he used was ""you better hurry up, or I'll start calling in my friends named Mickey and Vinny and they'll do to your legs what happened to this machine!""

Again

After more diagnostics finished, and I'd confirmed that his machine was out of warranty AND out of his service plan, so he would have to pay for parts on his own.

I explained what was going on to him, and that I shouldn't ""tell that shit to an Airborne Ranger who had 179 kills in 1972"" while still downing whiskey. He even pulled a Bob Dole and ranted about a war wound while rapping on his skull (it actually rang, meaning he had a metal plate in it - pretty cool with the sound, but the crazy was offputting).

At this point

SEE ATTACHED.

After I did that, before I could get out of there, I heard something that chilled the blood in my veins.

""Don't look on this as a weapon of war

NOPE^NOPE^NOPE^NOPE^NOPE

Sure enough, he pulled out a bolt-action sniper rifle. 

Again.

NOPE^NOPE^NOPE^NOPE^NOPE

He picked it up and started waving it around, I took the opportunity to get into his backyard (I have NEVER been so grateful for Sprint having crappy signal in so many areas) and instructed the Agent on the other end of the line to impersonate my store's manager. I told her to say that the police were at the store in regards to a previous client and some ""misplaced"" equipment (didn't exist at all, of course, but any port in a storm), and they needed to talk to me ASAP.

I passed him the phone when I went back in, and once he was out of sight (in his kitchen, then in his backyard), I threw my laptop into my embroidered laptop case (a gift from an ex who modeled for Suicide Girls), grabbed all my other gear (excepting my phone), and tiptoed out to the VW quietly. Once I got there (I'd unlocked the doors from the front porch via the keyfob), I threw my laptop case into the car, and dropped the transmission going into reverse

As luck would have it, and with her permission, I downed a few shots of whiskey to steady my nerves before calling centralized IS to wipe my phone (he'd started calling previous callers - coworkers - after I'd left), then the police over Skype. Once I was done with them, I called corporate and had him blacklisted from in-home service forever, dashed off an e-mail to my managers and basically table-flipped the whole thing at them, and sat back with a cranberry ginger ale while waiting for callbacks and responded to the thread on the forums to let people know I was okay.

The Memorial Villages (a subcity inside Houston, in the original folder (which is still on my trophy wall today), and the statement that they'd talk to their bosses and to the Harris County Psychiatric Center about a temporary involuntary commit. It turned out that he was on meds normally and had gone off them by choice.

They also

When he called the 1-800 number to rant and rave at them (and he used racial slurs at the rep, then blacklisted his number in the PBX so that he would get redirected to corporate for any inbound calls.

The next day, and ranted at the senior there for about half an hour, including the phrase ""NERD HERD TOOK MY GUNS!"" It was HILARIOUS. The senior, who was a friend of mine, went back and looked up his logs, then cheerfully informed the man that he was banned from not merely all in-home services, he was banned from even going into a Buy More under ANY circumstances!

I didn't get anything special from corporate for dealing with him

The tour was going well and the game was being publicised. It was becoming as popular as the console it was being demonstrated on.

The email explained in no uncertain terms that this game was not going to be released on their console unless the mistake was corrected *immediately*. They also demanded a fresh build of the game was sent to them before close of business. The situation had apparently become so heated that threats of war were being sent around the room and the delegates were also accusing the country of the console manufacturer of 'blatant political bias'.

I worked student IT support for a university. We handled phone calls for pretty much any technical problem a student has from internet not working to computer problems to their passwords expiring(this happens every 6 months if you didn't change it).

And finally we used to sell students computers. They were setup under our domain so that the login would be their school username and password and sync everything. By the time I started working

Anyways our manager had left for the day and I was left in charge for being senior tech. This was also my last month working here.

Ten minutes before closing on Friday an alumni calls. My coworker initially answered the call. The alumni had let their password expire and could no longer login to her computer. A simple password reset would fix the problem. The thing was

Of course the alumni had already thrown it away. This is a common occurrence so we have the ability to manually reset her password through active directory. However

At this point we're 5 minutes from closing. I tell my coworker to transfer the alumni to me and say she's transferring to her manager.

me: how may i help you?

alumni: i need my password reset so i can get into my computer. hopefully you can be more helpful than the b*tch i was just talking to.

now i'm pissed. no one gets to yell at my newbies like that and call them names just for sticking to our policy.

me: i see. we either need a code from your student ID or you need to fax or email in 2 forms of ID so we can verify that you're who you say you are.

alumni:i need you to make an exception for me.

me: no

alumni: I DEMAND YOU FIX THIS IMMEDIATELY OR ELSE I'LL SPEAK TO THE PRESIDENT AND GET YOU FIRED.

(president of the university)

me: Be my guest. My name is pcx226. Tell him I said hi.

The alumni keeps on ranting about how we suck and should all be fired and that the school never seems to hire competent help.

During all this I take a look at her account. It turns out this alumni's account was supposed to have been deleted last year. we phase out old accounts a year after graduation. I'm not sure why her account was still active so I go ahead and flag it for deletion. This process is automatic so her account would be deleted at the end of the month.

At this point we're 5 min past closing and everyone is listening to me on this call.

Me: Well I just took a look at your account. Turns out it should have been deleted last year. Since you have been such a joy to work with I've taken the liberty of deleting your account for you. You will no longer be able to login to anything associated with our university including your university email. Have a nice day. If you have any additional problems call us during our office hours Monday through Friday 9-7.

And then I hung up.

I texted my boss who told me that was hilarious but if she makes a big fuss I'll have to let you go. I told him I know

Fast forward to Monday. In our fax machine was 2 copies of the alumni's IDs. Along with a letter apologizing for her behavior and asking me oh so politely to undelete her account.

I reset the password and call the alumni back. I tell the alumni that we have reactivated her account and she has until the end of the month to set up forwarding on her email and retrieve any important emails. Also I sent instructions on how to remove her university login from her computer so this problem wouldn't happen again.

TLDR: alumni yelled at my cowoker


edit: my boss wouldn't have actually fired me. 
to be fair i'm pretty sure my boss would have only ""let me go"" because i was already leaving. it would give the department a small ""PR"" boost at no cost to any of the involved parties.

had i been staying i have faith that he would not have fired me. he's pretty much the best boss i've ever had.

All good things must come to an end

He did not like the situation at all, and eventually he exploited a loophole which enabled him to oust me from the tech support position into a bottom-rung gofer job.
   
  
   
This is not the story of how he forgot to line up a replacement first.
   
  
   
This is the story of the first couple of days afterwards, remember how to do anything I hadn't been officially trained on. After all, the job level I'd been transferred to was supposed to only exist for trainees, not staff, so I couldn't be officially expected to actually know anything.

Heh heh heh.

On of the triumvirate was a manager I'd bumped heads with before over various things. Mainly her wanting special treatment and me telling her to get back in her box. I got assigned to her for the training that the employer red tape said had to be done for everyone entering the bottom-rung level.

She saw it as an opportunity to exercise power over me. I saw it as an opportunity to play so exceedingly dumb that she would have to waste hours and hours going over basic procedure while I grinned at her and fielded queries from people who would interrupt us to ask me extremely complex questions.

One of my favorite memories from this time was making her show me, and written the complete instructions for doing everything on it (which had mysteriously gone missing the day before), it was so very sweet to make her have to keep getting up from her Desk Of Supervision and trot over to the other side of the building to push VCR buttons in front of me.

After a couple of weeks of this, under the manager who'd overseen the IT position. I was about ten feet away from the Office Manager's new office, and it's amazing the things you can do which stop just short of outright harassment, or which never get reported because someone's on too much of a power trip to ever let it be known that a bottom-rung employee was getting to them.

Our ISP is the only one that services our area with high speed internet. We literally have no other options

We had been having an issue where our internet would go out randomly, well that's certainly annoying. After it started happening EVERY HOUR we began to get really upset.

Unfortunately

**Them:** Well

**Us:** We know! It comes back after 5-10 minutes! We can't get you on the phone before it comes back!

**Them:** Well

So this exact conversation goes on for months. Which is REALLY frustrating. Especially when we got flagged as a repeat-caller. Ever call began with

After one night of attempting to stream a movie on netflix and restarting the modem/waiting 10 minutes/restarting the modem about 6 times

I called the ISP, and this poor support guy not only had nothing to do with causing my issue, and that this poor guy simply did not have any tools at his disposal to help me. But it didn't matter. I cried for like 30 minutes on the phone with this guy about how frustrating this whole thing had been.

Then he told me the loophole. I could upgrade to the ""business class"" of service (which is about 3.50$ extra a month for the level we were at already) and they would send a service tech to our house for free for any issue

Up to this point, and there had been no real work done. The first time I think they just walked in and replaced the modem, the second time the ran some tests, couldn't confirm the issue in the 15 mins they were there so they left, etc.

So I tell this poor guy that I have been completely losing my cool on for like 30 minutes that I don't honestly see how that could help. 

He then tells me that those service calls cost the ISP a lot, he used to work for the dispatch part of the ISP who calls those guys out, and he knew that after 3-4 call outs on a business client who is not paying for each one, it gets escalated up the pipeline fast.

So I say

After the 8th service guy was sent out

At this point they had:

* Replaced our modem 4 times 

* Added 3 different line-filters to weed out other signals disrupting the line

* Spent hours sitting in their van waiting for the signal to go out and then ""running tests""

* Rewired our house to the pole

* Rewired the entire neighborhood's pole system

After all this

What we didn't realize until he got to our house was that Scott was not an ""on-site"" tech. He was the type of guy that didn't have to deal with this shit. He was a big kahuna

What was the problem Scott diagnosed within about 20 minutes? Our neighbor (Who had never complained about their service) is a retired guy, or change settings about how they moved/ran or actually program things to do a certain ""dance"" every set period of time. Think windmills and faeries and other yard art, and fountains with different settings. What no one had realized in all their visits, is that all the tinkering stuff he set up completely fucks most wireless signals, and throws crazy interference over the cable line back to all the other people within range... which is only us, because we are the only two houses on our pole.

Once he figures it out, and how he can fix it so it stops fucking over our internet.

This is one of my favorite that might give you a good jumping off point to understand what I am dealing with in this environment.

We deal with a lot of users (tens of thousands) and therefore have very rigorous SLA numbers.  Well recently we migrated to Outlook and the call center numbers have been in the shitter - but that is to be expected and the parent company knew this well in advance.  However they still want to keep some normalcy to the process so they still go over SLA numbers on a call once a month.

One of our SLAs is time to answer calls - which with how busy its been has obviously been very very low (much lower than it is supposed to be).  We plug these numbers in to the parent company provided spreadsheet and then discuss it on the call.  For this particular month we noticed a problem with how their spreadsheet is set up - if we meet the number it turns green

Well during the meeting they congratulate us on meeting the number - we inform them that ""we are sorry

They come back with ""well - they put a lot of work in to this spreadsheet - I think as long as it comes up green it should be fine - we will mark it here on our end as a pass for the month"".

Now read on...
   
  
   
So there we were, our security was locked down tighter than an eel's ass. We had to lock our screens every time we stood up from our desks, and the keyboard shortcut for doing so on the Wang terminals had been ingrained into the employees' reflexes, sometimes for decades.  
   
  
   
When we got these newfangled things

* Firstly

* Secondly, in other words.  

* Thirdly

* Fourthly

I think you see where this is going.
   
  
   
So I wander down to the office manager, and could he give me his opinion on it? He's willing to give me ten minutes, so I ask him to log onto the mainframe - just to the main menu screen is fine. I then ask him to lock his screen and step away as he would normally do. ""OK,"" I tell him, ""imagine you've left the room for a couple of minutes. Someone comes along and does this."" - and I step around to his keyboard, notice he hasn't locked Windows, and fire up Recorder and hide it - ""Then you return to your computer, lock your screen again. At some point, you're not in front of your computer for five minutes once more, and scan for his userID

I hand him a piece of paper with his userID and password written on it.
   
  
   
Now at this point I am a cocky kid who has just *apparently* cracked national security in thirty seconds flat for a multibilliondollar organisation whose privacy controls are matters of national politics. Oh, including everything logged under his userID. In retrospect, I probably shouldn't have stood there grinning and looking entirely too pleased with myself, or let the manager decide which channels to escalate this information to.

As a result, and dragged over the coals. There ensues something of a verbal brawl - they're trying to determine if I have already compromised the mainframe which controls billions of government dollars, or leaked the information to anyone else. I'm annoyed at the way I'm being treated because I was the first person to actually bother to tell them about the very easily identifiable giant-ass security hole THEY shipped out to every office in the nation. I should have been getting a goddamn commendation, as far as I was concerned. Maybe a medal for, as I may have put it in a heated moment, ""Doing all your lazy-ass jobs FOR you, and apparently doing it better!""
   
  
   
So, and there is nothing stopping me from walking up the road to the local Member of Parliament's office and regaling him with enough juicy material to win him headlines well into the next electoral period. They can't even fire me - the union for that place was a six-hundred-pound gorilla and its hobby was jumping up and down on managers. The intimidators have nothing to work with. All they've accomplished is irritating me.  

Oh, I toss at them ""Of course, you realise that even if you fix this, we still don't have [TEMPEST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TEMPEST) shielding.""

They go bananas. They want to know where I heard that term, they already blew their chance. I tweak them a little further by telling them that most computer people have known about it for years - didn't they keep up with the industry? - and that it was frankly none of their goddamn business what I'd been doing in my personal time. Finally, as they'd made *perfectly* clear over the last hour, IT security wasn't my problem. It was theirs. *I* was going to have a really good night's sleep that night.  
   
  
   
Then there was the time I made a manager I disliked spend her time personally training me to press three buttons on a VCR...

Me: ""Sure"" and i write it down while some of the other customers were struggling to holding back laughing at the whole situation. Then she went.

A couple, so we're talking original Xbox). Their son's birthday party was that night, and they wanted to surprise him by having the account set up when his friends got there. WDD obviously thought this was a waste of time and money, so I dealt mostly with Soccer MILF.

At that time, and a rather long one at that, given SM's description of where the modem was in relation to the XBox. 

I eventually get them squared away, and even if it was, he'd be paying a ridiculous amount just to have them plug in a cable. He then demands my cellphone number in case things don't go smoothly; I tell him he can call the store and ask for me. This entire time he's been talking about how he won't hesitate to ""return all this crap"" if he can't get it set up properly.

Jump ahead 20 minutes, but she managed to get him to agree to let her call me before he drove up demanding a refund. I ask where she is in the process, and she's done well: The cable is plugged into the modem, in the right port even, but she can't find the jack in the back of the XBox.

XB: There should be a hole in the back of the XBox that looks just like the ones in the back of your modem.

SM: I'm looking at the Game Box

XB: Make sure it's facing the right way. The front should have four slots for controllers

SM: I see the four joystick holes; one of them is plugged in. And I see the power cord and the TV cord. But I just don't see that hole.

At this point, demanding to speak to my manager, etc. He no longer is talking about a refund, but rather has moved on to how this will ""ruin his son's entire birthday"" if it doesn't get sorted out.

SM eventually gets the phone back, though I can hear WDD in the background ranting about what he'll do to me if they ""come all the way up here"" and I can't fix it.

I don't know if they had a fight on the way, drops the console on the counter with the cable, and says ""Ok, smartness, let's see how smug you are now.""

I look at the console, set the console down.

XB: Can one of you please go tell this jackass how to plug his ethernet cord into this XBox.

Supervisor: *In tones as serious as can be* XB... that's a GameCube.

XB: I know it's a fucking GameCube. But the only way I'm telling him that is if I get to beat him to death with it.

Turns out their son had multiple consoles, but WDD would have none of it. She had actually managed to bring the XBox along, but he had made her leave it in the car at first; that's why he was so pissed when he got there.

1338280477.0,ua2ee,How Nearly Being Court-Martialed Earned Me a Promotion,cobysev,1104,249,144,"A little background: I work IT for the US Air Force.  This happened about a decade ago

At the time, etc.  One day, while manually pushing anti-virus updates to stubborn PC's on the network, I noticed a potential flaw in our security.  Instead of downloading the latest anti-virus updates directly from the company's website as soon as they were released, a higher level of the Air Force would download them and test them before releasing them for the individual bases to download.  It was the military's little bit of added security - make sure the anti-virus company hadn't been hacked and were releasing viruses instead of updates.

The problem with this process was that the Air Force testers were slow.  Really slow.  It would be anywhere from 2 days to 3 weeks before the latest updates were ready for us to implement.  I trusted our AV company, it would download and automatically push to all servers and PC's.  This also saved me the trouble of burning the Air Force's copy to a disc and moving it to our servers (this was before flash drives were popular).  This saved me about 30 minutes of my morning and ensured our network was always updated and secured.

Fast-forward a few months.  There's a huge malicious outbreak in the world (a trojan, except mine.  Other bases are working long hours, days on end, trying to purge the virus from the entire network.  My base network never so much as hiccuped.  Because I alone had downloaded the latest updates.

Naturally, they found my batch file and they weren't pleased.

According to them

Eventually, money, and manpower trying to get back up and running.

In the end, and sent back to work.  No court martial paperwork ever came down for me.

A few months later, an IT guy was given greater recognition than the pilots who are actually flying missions all day long.

Some context first, etc..), they were also having a raised floor/new AC installed in the server room and since I had nothing else to do in this country (in a remote small town area) I stuck around to watch it with the IT staff there.

It was on a Sunday night around 8pm

There were loud cries for help (in another language) and screaming, but I was not prepared for it in real life.  The IT manager with me was in shock as was I, but I snapped myself out of it and got him to contact Security immediately (they had medics on site).  The medics came and then eventually an ambulance showed up, which took him to the hospital.  By this point he was conscious and moving, but irrational and trying to fight anyone who came near him, he had to be sedated.

What the hell actually happened?

As soon as Health and Safety cleared us (took about 2 hours), the injured contractor had opened the door on a large rack size UPS, removed the bottom security panel, stuck his head in the bottom of the UPS while reaching for something.  His head came into contact with the 220 Volt rails, and he was electrocuted.  At no point were they supposed to be near the UPS (they were well aware of this), and the next morning when we went to check on him again (bringing the whole IT dept this time, as backup) he refused to answer why he went near the UPS.  Thankfully last I heard, he is going to be alright which was a massive relief.

I work for a company that produces medical devices. One of the functions of my department is defective device returns: When one of our products fails in the field

Normal protocol for packaging a return that has been used on a person is to drain it of blood, encapsulate the device in an airtight container and then put it into the box. It is immediately apparent that whoever processed this return had done absolutely none of that. The box before them is soaked in human blood.

Upon opening it up, was identified as a problem it was pulled from the system while filled with the patient's blood. Instead of draining the device, or trying to recover any of the patient's precious bodily fluids, the guy responsible for any of this merely clamped off the incoming and outgoing tubes, looked at his work and proclaimed, ""close enough"". Please note that this is a catastrophic failure to obey not just universal protocol (which is to treat all blood as if it has Wizard AIDS) but common sense itself. Well, surprisingly

2.  When it comes to technology

I own a local IT Shop in a small town of about 11-12K people.  I am the only established shop in town with a storefront.  We service both residential and businesses for IT issues with PC's, ETC.  If you want to utilize a competitor, you have to call someone in a neighboring town which is about 25-30 miles away and most likely will charge you an additional fee for travel time.  My company charges only the hourly rate with a minimum of one hour starting at the time we arrive on-site.

My tale begins today with a business customer's office manager who I'll call Phyllis Lou (PL) who is trying to cut the cost of our services as she see's fit.  (IE: On December 22nd

1.  This customer has a special discounted rate of $45.00 an hour since they have been a customer since we started the company.  Our regular business rate is about $30 more per hour.

2.  My personal home is about 1/2 a mile away from the client-site

I receive a call from Phyllis Lou at about 12:30 p.m. today because her computer won't start up.  She wants to know if we can come take a look at it.  I remind her of the minimum one hour charge and she agrees to come have me look at it.

I travel the half-hour trip to her office and find her PC running with no video.  I check the monitor and the power indicator light is not showing.  I press the power button and presto the monitor comes to life and her desktop appears.  The following conversation ensues:


ME: ""Do you have anything else for me to look at while I am out here?""


PL: ""We're not paying you for that


ME: ""Phyllis, I provided the service.""


PL: ""Well, I'll call Max Freelance.  He will only charge us $40.00 per hour!""


(Max Freelance is a guy that does PC Repair out of his home in his spare time.  He also works day shift at a factory from 9 a.m. until 6 p.m. Monday through Friday in a neighboring town about 45 minutes away.  This is not a viable threat


Me: ""Do you think that Max Freelance would charge you less than a dollar for his time?  Plus you are going to have to wait for him to get off work.  Is the extra hour and a half of your time actually worth the $5.00 you would be saving?  Now if you have anything else that you need me to look at


PL: ""Well


Me: ""Phyllis, I will include it in your one hour rate charge.""


PL: ""You might as well leave.  You can bill whatever you like


I leave, I would consider a win.

While working in this department, was the department secretary. She was a big fan of downloading every piece of junkware she could find and slowing her computer to a crawl.  Worse still was that she managed to integrate whatever utility the software enticed her with into her work flow, so removing it meant re-training her on the right way to do things.  I wasn't allowed to lock down her computer, as she might find that demeaning... this was the official policy from our mutual supervisor.  It was bad enough that I kept an identical computer ready to go, and would just transfer her files to it when her computer became unusable, then re-image the ruined one and keep it ready to repeat the process.  Suffice to say, Stacy was not a friend to computers.

This is not my tale, passwords and serial numbers were listed, processes were detailed... they were left in a state where most small problems could be dealt with until they hired someone to replace me.  I even gave them my phone number at the new job, just in case they needed help finding a piece of info, or a tip on an easy repair.  This was my mistake.

Stacy was designated to fill in for me while I was gone.  As bad as that might have been

After a couple of weeks though

Stacy asked how to fix it, such as asking how she could restore from the tape to make it work.  I just kept explaining that until there was a working drive array, none of that would be possible.  I'd end calls and get another an hour later.  This went on for days.  She'd call and ask if I could walk her through fixing a drive array over the phone.

This was no longer a simple matter of filling in the blanks with a two minute phone call.  I finally had to tell her that if they hadn't managed to hire a new IT guy, though, from poor Stacy who wanted to be walked through recovery from a catastrophic server failure.

A little backstory:

I am lucky enough in my job that I have a very loose dress code, and possibly a hoodie if it is cold. What I am getting at here is that I look like a student or some other random person. I have no id badge or anything identifying me as a staff member unless I show my staff ID in my wallet. My ensemble for today consists of a pair of jeans and a monty python themed killer bunny shirt.

So I arrive at the next dorm that I am to do updates to and find that it is one of the few buildings on campus that does not have a card swipe access. The attendant inside sees me try to open the locked door and proceeds to let me in with just a ""hello"". So I then proceed over to the eight computer stations and begin my work.

One of the stations had been tampered with and was wanting a bios password before it would boot up

So while I am dismantling this computer

So I end up finishing the lab update and I decide to say something to this woman who is supposed to be watching over stuff and is obviously not a student worker. First I tell her how the login has changed (moved the units to AD). Then I say:

**Her**: Oh...yeah I was watching what you were doin'. You probably saw that I was starin' at you (I didn't). But I saw your ID card so I didn't say anything.

1. New to the company

2. This woman has been with the company for over 20 years. One day she has a question and comes over to my laptop and asks me to look at something for her. I pull it up and she says ""No, now I get it. I was using the Deep Black theme. Because I wasn't using the default (white) theme I wasn't ""programming"". 

3. This one has been with the company around 30 years. Long time project manager, right?"" ""Oh yes, right here."" Long story short, she's trying to use her Windows laptop user name and password to log into Unix. Not something I'd demand a project manager to understand (they should, it's part of the business), but something pretty crucial to an aspiring programmer.

An employee has been complaining for a while that his laptop has been crashing,  it's a CPU overheating issue and decided to monitor the laptop in our work area until it crashes. After spritzing out the fan intake/out guards with canned air, we leave it for a day with it in our plain view, while running Prime95 for CPU stress tests. Laptop never crashes. So we give it back to him stating we can't see why it's crashing, but with a note to bring it back as soon as the crash happens, so we can try to glean some dump info off it.


About an hour goes by and he returns saying 'it happened again'. Mind baffling that in one hour he was able to reproduce the overheat/crash that we where not able to in a full day. Anyway, and re-apply some thermal paste. 


 **This is where ~~shit~~ gets nutty.**


After about 45 min of work, something got broke off into it, maybe it can't spin'. On a closer inspection I notice that all the pieces of plastic are black, and uniform in shape. I take out the fan assembly, and there right beneath it is every single fan blade broken off the central hub.... The fan spins the hub, but **no blades are on it!** I look at the metal guard on the heatsink and see it is bent in nearly the exact width of a small screwdriver diameter. He stuck a screwdriver into the fan guards and broke every single fan blade off of it. As if this was not enough, the reason the CPU didn't overheat during our tests is because we had the laptop in a normal room temp range. Derp employee had his laptop in his office


Derp employee literally broke the CPU fan and caused his CPU to continually overheat by running CPU intensive applications while said laptop without a fan,False,,t5_2sfg5,False,,tftsflair,t3_1706pc

It all ends with this chapter. It’s been heartwarming reading all your comments
* * *

I was staring at the screen for what have been minutes. I was looking at an FTP server software package. It was one of the FTP-programs that we sold actually. I opened it and was met with the default screen. I knew how the program worked and re-opened the previous session. It gave me a directory with thousands upon thousands of files. You could not know what the files were from the names. 

There were many pictures, even adjusted it to suit his purpose and I never felt that my personal folder or school records stored on the school network were safe from his prying eyes. He has said some things in the past that he could only know from reading my school record. 

My throat felt like it was being chocked when I opened the first image on the list. It was a picture of a full nude woman having sex with a man - it looked like it was taken by the couple themselves. Like most of the porn that I’ve seen in this store I wasn’t particularly excited to see it. I looked at another 12 or so pictures

He probably ran some back alley porn website for people with rather poor taste. Questionable yes. Illegal? No. I was calmed down by now and felt easier

It was strange to see a picture of a kid among all this pornography. I downloaded the next few images that were on the list to see what was going on. As they started opening one by one on the screen my entire body went in shock. I quickly tried to turn off the monitor and by doing that even knocked it over. What was displayed on that screen was gruesome to see. Everything I did not want to see that kid do was there on those pictures.

I went into what I will still call shock. I didn’t really respond to anything for a few minutes. I was just sitting there

I must have tried calming myself down for over 15 minutes before trying to walk over to Jeremy to tell him all about this

It wasn’t until I saw a figure come in that I freaked; The cage was open

It took him some time to get me talking and after I told him he was the one that didn’t say anything for a while. He sat with me for a while before he walked over to the computer and put the monitor to its feet again. He didn’t doubt me. He just needed to know if it was just those photo’s or if there was more. Even accusing Ron &amp;amp; Don with something horrible as this was something they didn’t deserve if they didn’t do it. He walked back to me and said “We are going to the police

We walked to the police station as it was only 10 minutes away. When we stood by the counter an agent started talking with us. Jeremy did the word as he seemed to still be able to make himself sound intelligible. The agent took us seriously and walked us to the back to one of the offices in the building. He gave us something to drink while we waited. Cheap disgusting office coffee

After 15 minutes another agent came in with a woman who introduced herself as a detective. She would be taking our story as the accusation was something they took very seriously. I snapped “It’s not an accusation! I saw it with my own eyes”. She understood my anger and took the time to calm me down and explain everything. We had been at the police station for over 2 hours when my parents were called to pick me and Jeremy up.

The police seized all the computers and hard disks in the store the next morning and Ron &amp;amp; Don were arrested. From what I heard Ron was going mental when he was arrested. Don was going silently. 

* * *

I obviously had quit this job by now, and what happened that night. I was still underage at that moment and needed to have one of my parents with me. I had kept so much about the store from them, for better or for worse. I told everything. My father visibly was breaking apart from all of it. He would’ve made me quit before I had even started if I had told him everything.

Frank &amp;amp; Richard were also questioned by the police and from talking with them later were for the first time in their life silent for more than a minute. Even they had not suspected anything and were genuinely concerned about me and Jeremy. The interviews with the police were really heavy on Sarah who only found out when the police came to the front door. She was just starting to get her life together. Johan and Marcel were questioned as well from what I heard

The store was sealed off after Ron &amp;amp; Don were arrested. Weeks had gone by and I hadn’t seen or heard anything from them. They were still in custody. `When I walked with Jeremy past the store it had been boarded up. Last year after being empty for years it was demolished to make place for a new housing project.

It took months before the trial against Ron &amp;amp; Don started and the police stayed quiet about any progress they had been making in the meantime. Jeremy seemed to have recovered quite well from all this

For me it was something that kept me up at nights. I went into therapy for this. My view before all this was that therapy is for the crazy people that couldn’t deal with the world. I was hesitant to go and be labeled as a crazy person. Nothing was further from the truth. I was processing everything that happened and was finally letting go.

When I went to the trial it was the first time in months that I saw  Ron and Don. By now I was done with school and  trying to enjoy my summer vacation before starting at my new school. Ron &amp;amp; Don looked different. They had lost a lot of weight and looked tired. They had on suits which was a strange sight. Ron looked at me with an intense hate in his eyes. He blamed everything on me I suppose. Don didn’t look at me. He looked like a broken man

At the trial I learned that Ron had been hosting the FTP-server with the content since the late 90s. Around that time the store was doing rather bad and he needed money. One of the people he knew had hired him to set up the site that was still being used. He was a facilitator

None of the content of the site was original content according to Ron’s lawyer. Nor had Ron ever created or looked at any of the content. I was happy when the prosecution did not challenge this fact. It meant that it was probably true. According to the lawyer Ron had simply rented the computer out to the third man that was on trial as well. I didn’t know him

When it came to the users of the server; there were a few dozen of users. Every user is of course one to many

 I must say I was happy they weren’t professional. 

The lawyer had tried to get the judge to dismiss the server evidence as it could have been tampered with by me and Jeremy or anyone else for that matter. I was relieved when the judge didn’t accept it and went on with the proceedings

When it came to Don the proceedings became fast. The prosecutor was sure of his guilt and participation in the crime. But the evidence did not reflect it. He never was near the cage and there was no any activity from him logged on the server. His house search had turned up nothing.
The judge did not find him guilty. I still don’t know wether or not he knew. I hope he did not knew.

* * *

As for me and Jeremy

Sarah recovered completely in the months after. We still speak and hang out on a regular basis. She now works with an IT-Company that provides software services.

As for me. The therapy had helped immensely and  I moved out of the town after the trial was over to go to a new school. Not heaving learned my lesson I took another job about 9 months later that again involved customers and a rather chauvinistic boss.

Years ago in an Enterprise support environment for a company I used to work for, and the conversation begins with the user along the lines of:




Me: ""Hello, how many I help?""

User: ""WHERE IS MY DATA?!""

Me: ""Your files? Have you looked in My Documents or on the file server for them?""

User: ""No

Me: ""Where exactly are you trying to open your file up in the first place?""

User: ""From the Recent Files menu in Excel. Every time I click on my file it says File not found!""





From this point, to continue onward, the call begins to escalate further. I maintain a calm attitude as I automatically head towards the user's desk since I knew from experience something like this wasn't going to end well, whilst remaining on the phone with them to try to sort this one out. I continue to ask them where they think they last saved the file, if they moved it around and so on. I was eventually able to get out of them ""My Documents"" after a lot of resistance from them, and I had them check the My Documents folder after getting the exact path out of Excel. The user states they see files, but not the one they're looking for. I have them use Windows Search to find the file name elsewhere in the computer

At this point it's clear to me that they've moved the file, followed by ""NEVER MIND, NEVER MIND, BYE! -click-""

Five minutes later after getting hung up on, and the monitor (A CRT) was turned and nearly about to fall off of the desk.

I found the computer moments later around the corner from where their office was in a hallway. It was laying on the ground with the side panel busted open (they are locked shut for obvious reasons), the PS/2 plug for the mouse connected to the back of the machine with the rest of the cabling missing, and well, you can get the picture. On the inside of the machine, the motherboard tray was damaged, missing some of the plastic risers holding it up, and some of the add-on PCI devices were also coming out of the slots due to the motherboard. Nothing else looked damaged.

In the back of the machine I found of all things, I installed that into a known good machine and began to run some forensic software on the drive to search for previously deleted items. I connected the USB Flash drive to another machine, and upon the device being recognized and mounted I see the missing file, perfectly intact with a modify date from the day prior sitting right in the root, clearly not at the path the user had mentioned on the phone. The forensic software also returned back with that same file, showing identical dates and data to what the flash drive copy had but in a deleted state.

I've been a long time lurker but a first time poster on this subreddit and now I'm currently commuting to my lovely job as a tech support agent

I've been in techsupport for over 7 years now and I've done it all

**Invoices and inevitable doom**

Let us start at the beginning

""Hello

And a really posh guy answered *""Hi, so it could be a splitter problem or something to do with the signal* and I collect this guy's customer information. And much to my dismay I saw the problem right away and to be honest I panicked. I seriously started to stutter and to sweat and thought to myself *""Ah, man! This guy is going to freak out on me and it's only my first day.. I don't want to handle this shit"". So I swallowed my fear and said *""Well Sir, I euhm.. I.. I've seem to have located the issue and it seems that you have two unpaid invoices that are due with a total sum of 3500 euro and that's why your television services have been temporarily suspended until the invoices are paid.""* 

Let me just briefly explain that I've been trained to handle your basic household subscriptions and the average people spend on their monthly services is around 60 euros

And I thought this guy was going to ge berserk and he replied *""Ah, WTF!? just happened? I thought this guy would go mental!


It turns out after I did some digging that the customer in question was the owner of a hotel and in every room there was a settop box for video on demand and such and his accountant neglected to pay us. Pfew

**Finding out your son is gay

This is a story of how a tactical error on my part caused severe repercussions for the customer in question. Oi.. here is goes.


""Hello

""Yes

""Well I understand why you would want to know that Miss"" And I collect the customer information and pull up the latest invoice. Immediately I see that a paid *""service""* number has been called quite a few times. (and I mean service in this case in the broadest of terms) and I tell the lady that if she logs into her account she can see the same invoice I'm currently looking at and that she can see that her invoice is so high because of her phone usage."" She told me that she lived in a three person household

She informed that her PC was up for repairs and inquired if I could look in to it. I told her that I couldn't give her the number due to legal reasons and I advised her to log in via another pc to check the invoice herself.
That's when she got smart.
She asked me if I could see the number which I couldn't deny because I told her I have the same invoice in front of me that she received via her account.
She asked me if I had access to google
She asked me if I could google the number to see what kind of *""services""* it provided. So I did and I was not disappointed. 
*""I've googled the number but I would like to ask you to confront your son about this phone usage
*""I want to know what kind of services have been dialed, I wish to know!""*
*""Consider said services
*""Please tell me""*
*""Ok
*""but I didn't know my son was gay...""*

1363369723.0,1ad0wm,The Story of the $2000 Patch Cable,VERY_LOUD_USERNAME,954,149,108,"Long story

I sub-contract for a guy (which we'll call Joe) that provides internet services for hotels. The ISP brings a line in, and to the guests over wireless. He's from a city a couple hours away. Generally, I cover his clients in my city (which we'll call Loudtown), he covers the clients in his (Joetown).

He's on vacation. I'm covering all of his calls.

So I take a call: ""Hey

Basic questions follow.

""Okay. I'll connect in and take a look from my end and give you a call back.""

I can connect into both of their routers. That's a good start. The one that handles their back office is show a fair number of dropped packets. I'm getting a lot of timeouts pinging the load balancer from the router. The other router seems fine. Figure maybe the cable's bad.

I call back.

""Okay

She hunts one down

I start trying to walk her through identify either end of the cable that we're going to try replacing. The load balancer is a little DrayTek device that looks something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/COLqxMe.jpg) minus the antennas.

Given a description and the fact that it says ""DrayTek"" on the front... She can't find it. But she can find the router. I'm logged in. I can see the connection to the load balancer is on port 1.

""Okay
""Yeah.""  
""Okay. I need you to follow that to the other end
""It doesn't go anywhere.""

...

I don't have any diagrams

A few more rounds of this same question phrased different ways

""It goes into the big machine.""  
""Sorry?""  
""The big loud machine.""  
""Does this big loud machine have a door and shelves inside?""  
""Yes."" (Oh ffs.)  
""Okay. I need you to open the door and look in there. For the 'DrayTek' device.""

(It's a rack with a door

It's about this point I get a ""hold on"" expecting him to start looking. Instead I hear some muffled voices and some other guy picks up.

""We have a support contract. This is ridiculous. Our whole office is down and everyone's standing around unable to work and we have to get our accounting done. You need to come in and do this right now.""  
""I'm sorry, I'm sure we can resolve this.""  
""Let me speak to Joe right now.""  
""I'm sorry
""Okay. You need to send him an e-mail right now.""  
""I can certainly do that for you
""That's not good enough. Someone needs to come in
""I understand your concern
""Why didn't he get someone in Joetown to handle his calls?""  
""I don't know. You would have to ask him that. If I had to venture a guess
""No. Someone is going to come out or we're cancelling our contract. We're cancelling all of our contracts."" (This guy owns and manages about half a dozen large hotels.)  
""If you'd just let me-""  
""Someone better be here by 5 or I'm cancelling my contract.""

Now, on a good day. I'm still sitting around in sweats, and the weather hasn't been great, so the highways probably aren't pristine. There's no way anyone is getting there by 5 unless they have a secret teleporter or a time machine.

""There's absolutely no way I am able to get there by 5
""If someone's not here [blah blah blah hot air].""  
""Yes

Now, he probably won't be pleased if he comes back and I've lost him a half a dozen contracts within the week.

So I pack my gear up, check the tires, fuel up... And hit the highway.

It's pretty good for the first 60 miles or so

They've left no instruction with the front desk. They've left no access to their offices. I can get in the comms room

Some phone calls later and they've revealed a hidden key to the front desk girl to get me in with explicit instructions I'm not to be out of her sight while I'm in there.

A little offended

We head in

I pick a computer. ""This one's fine.""

I pick another. ""This one works.""

I pick another. ""This one works too.""

I pick another... no connection.

I interrupt the conversation with the front desk girl. A little unprofessional

""Whose desk is this?""  
""That's Carla's. She's the owner's assistant.""  
""Does... Does Carla do the accounting?""  
""Yes... Oh my god.""

I pull the cable from the PC

I measure

I ask if they can comp me a room since I've driven all this way. Because the highways were bad coming out. Because the highways will be worse going back. Because it's dark out.

They won't.

I stop by a fast food joint and eat a quite meal by myself. Did I mention this was my birthday? It was my birthday. I spent it alone eating a hamburger hours from home.

I used to commute on the highway. I would drive home when it was blizzarding so badly I couldn't see the hood of my car for 80% of the trip (as long as there's a bit of clear view once in a while to re-align your car with the road

I was doing below 20mph at points

They wouldn't take the support provided

I generally don't bill time spent driving (just mileage)

I generally don't worry about billing callout fees or minimum callouts

By the time the day is over

All because they had to be melodramatic instead of giving me a proper description of the problem in the first place.

But hey

I will begin my journey through the horrors of tech support with you where it at all began for me....

I was 18 and finally old enough to work anywhere I wanted without restriction, I was an original 'black shirt' as they called us before 'freak' squad came to be. I had my newly obtained A+ cert and was ready to conquer the tech world with my broad knowledge. On my 3rd day behind the bench, a lady brought in her top of the line E-Machine (HA!) in for us to look at because according to her, it was making 'loud grinding noises' and then powered down and never would come back on. In these days, we would take the effected machine to the bench (in plain sight for all to see), run a few tests and diags to determine what may need done. So I told the lady to give us 15-20 minutes and come back and we should have a pretty good idea of what’s going on. So I take the lovely E-Machine back to the desk and the first thing I want to instinctively check was of course the PSU (for any non techys, that's the power supply in the computer). As I attempt to take off the side panel, the panel came off to reveal a makeshift magazine rack. Yes ladies and gentleman, the hard part was explaining to the customer what went wrong with her machine. 

After some deliberation

Customer: So what did you find out!?

Me: Well

Customer: Magazines?! What kind of magazines!? 

Me: Um...

Customer: It DEFINITELY wasn't me

Me: Adult material...So would you like us to...

*Before I could finish

*Within a short period of time

Customer: Tell HIM what you found...

Me: Um

It seemed to calm her down when I did the usual QnA with her, and was a nice, if somewhat sullen guy.

Taking out my normal tools for the job (I normally use a liveCD Linux distro for this, increases chance of a 100% recovery, also impresses people when they actually look and see me typing in Terminal), I quickly found the directory she stated and managed a 100% recovery of it all. I double checked and made copies of it all on my external DVD and recovered the actual photos for her hard drive. 

I then told her the photos were safe

I was expecting waterworks. I wasnt expecting a full-on double hug and the Hoover Dam breaking.

So I was standing there with a crying mother and an apparently grateful father letting it all out for a good 10 minutes before she calmed down enough and she found all her pictures again. I was feeling good about myself and other than my (reduced

Alright then. First off let me say that I am one of two employees at my company. We are a small ISP with about 200 customers. Anything related to our network is my responsibility

**First incident:**

We have our main router set up to redirect users with an outstanding balance to a page that says ""pay your bill if you want your internet to work"". The boss doesn't tell us to turn people off until they are at least 3 months behind on their bill. Anyway, she gives me a sob story about how she needs her internet turned back on to do her schoolwork (it is the week before finals). I guess I felt sorry for her since I was in the midst of finals madness myself, so I told her I would turn her service back on but that it would be limited to 128 kbps. Enough to pull up webpages for school but not enough to dick around on YouTube or NetFlix. She starts to freak out on me like I did something wrong. She says, ""why would I want that? This is just going to make me not pay my bill ever"" I'm trying to explain to her that what I suggested is against company policy, and is purely out of the goodness of my heart but she isn't having it. ""You shouldn't have turned my service off in the first place!"" She said some other stupid things that I don't really remember but eventually it got to the point that I told her that I was leaving her service off because she didn't seem to understand the concept of paying for services received and that if she wanted to use the internet, she would have to go to the university library or a coffee shop. At this point she asked to speak to my manager. I told her to wait a second and I would put him on. I yelled at my boss, who was in his office, I wasn't sure how my boss would respond. My boss picked up the phone and without missing a beat said

**Second incident:**

The end of this incident occurred about a week ago, I'll make him happy. I tell him that I will mount our equipment to a light pole about 25 feet from his house if he promises me that he will bury the cable after I leave. I warned him that we have had problems in the past with cows and horses chewing on the cables. He says, ""No problem, whatever I need to do to keep it off the roof."" Perfect. I do my install and then I go on my merry way. Around a month later I get a call from this guy that his internet isn't working so I head back to his place. Once I get there I find that the cable was never buried and his horses have chewed the cable in half in three different places. He tells me he thinks his friend ran the cable over. I point out the teeth marks on the cable, but for some reason he still doesn't believe that his horses did it. A funny side note about this guy: he's an electrician. When I got there he was confused that his equipment wasn't powered on. When I reminded him that the cable was cut in half, he said ""I thought it was wireless?"". I wanted to tell him that as an electrician, he should know better than anyone that wireless power is not a thing yet, I ran a new cable for him, my coworker had to go out to his house to replace the cable a third time. This got me pretty pissed off. I mean

Me: ""What are we going to do to make sure this doesn't happen again?""

Him:""Well... I guess I'll bury the cable..""

Me:""Why didn't you do it after the last three times we were here?""

Him:""Well I think that since you are providing the service

As he was saying this I could feel my blood boiling.

Me: ""I put our equipment on that pole under the condition that *you* bury the cable. Do you remember that?""

Him: ""Yeah

At this point

Me: ""I don't care what you think. I'm telling you how it's going to be. If you want to continue to use our service

Him: ""Well I'm not going to bury it.""


Me: ""You will if you want to keep playing XBox Live.  I know for a fact your only other option for internet service is satellite and that won't cut it. If this happens again

Him: ""We'll see.""

I had to leave after that or else I would have started cursing at him. I told my boss about it when I got back to the office. He laughed and said

If I ever have to go back to that guy's house

TL;DR: Customers suck.

I was working in a call center where the majority of my job was helping people with internet connectivity issues at hotels.

One day in the Summer of '08 I took a call from a frantic woman.  She said she was staying in a crappy motel chain in Iowa that we supported.  I gathered that she had no connectivity with the wireless routers they had available and that the motel staff were clueless as to what needed to be done.

I logged into the server remotely and discovered that there were some catastrophic errors that could only be solved by a tech coming to the location and servicing it or replacing it.  It was a complete no go.  She was screwed.

I relay this to her as easily and calmly as I can.  She absolutely loses it.  She starts calling me names and swearing at me in English and what sounded like German.  Normally, but an utter **breakdown**.


After a minute or so of this, where a massive flood has just occurred.

Not only that, but also her job and her own livelihood.  I can hear it in her voice that she's about to lose it.

At this point, however for this call I couldn't have given one fuck about my stats.

I pulled up our area support map for Cedar Rapids and looked for nearby hotels in our network.  I managed to find another one of the same chain only 5 miles away.  Then I checked on the internet service there and found that it was up and running perfectly.

These cheap motels are franchises so the internet service you buy at one of them does not work at another one just down the road.  She had purchased a card with an access code on it

In total it was a 45 minute call that really screwed up my stats for the week

[Chapter 1 - My first job in IT](http://redd.it/xtlhx) 


* * *

The first few weeks at the store were rather dull. Don mostly assigned me to work the register and help customers finding what they needed. Restocking and cleaning the store was a task that befell me from the moment I started working there. The shelves were high and stocked from the floor to the ceiling. I had to kneel down low to fill the bottom shelves and reach high to fill to upper shelves. While I felt uncomfortable knowing customers and especially Ron

That was until Don called us all in for the monthly store meeting. Everybody was there. Don and Ron stood at the head of the table, I know.

Don had great news

Richard and Frank giggled like little girls, who was one of those prodigy children that are good at everything they touch and revered by the entire family. Unfortunately he took up web design, so our website looked like it belonged on Geocities in the 90’s, but then again so did the store. I should give him credit for staying so close to the source.

Don took the word again and opened up another box and pulled out the new uniforms. Polo shirts with our logo stamped on them. They looked reasonably fashionable. It was better than the small shirt I had til now - maybe I could actually breathe in these. My hope was short lived as I saw Ron and Don looking towards me. “Fuck” was the only thing my brain could utter again. They got a white bag from under the table

“We ordered both male and female uniforms” said Ron

Feeling like a teenage hooker I went back into the store

Most of them were regulars that bought all their computer hardware and software from us

They spend hours on end scouring the internet for movies and pictures of their favorite adult actresses. They did not seem to stop until they knew they caught them all. To have the very best. They however also caught viruses and malware that their B-grade virus scanners failed to detect

Jeremy understood my shame in walking around like a teenage hooker for at least two weeks and covered my store-shift so I could work in the back whenever he could. Me and Jeremy usually worked the Thursday and Friday evening shifts from 5pm to 9pm and Saturdays from 9am to 6pm.  Don was usually not around during the evenings so it worked out fine

* * *
I was working my second shift dressed like a teenage hooker and was cleaning up the store that have been left like it had been ransacked by an angry mob. Ron told it was a busy day and they had no time to clean it all up. I had to clean up the store. Great. 

I checked the register first and looked at the sales we made. Seven sales

To get back to the story; I was cleaning up the store and still dressed like a teenage hooker when a regular customer walked in. I was bent over one of the tables, but I knew what it meant. Looking at him I saw he was proud of himself for saying it; as if he practiced for weeks. He then saw that I took offense and quickly wiped the smug expression from his face and mumbled “Nevermind, I’ll find out myself” while walking away. I hoped I’d never see him again, however he was nothing compared to the next one a few days later.

It was about 2 hours into my new shift when a new customer walked in. He looked at me, no problem - we offer recovery services. “Where’s the computer?” I asked. “It’s in my car” he said. “Can you help me get it out, girl?”. The way he said it alarmed me enough to not do it. “You get the PC out of the car and I’ll get out gear out of the back so we can see what is going on” I said and immediately walked away to the back, getting Jeremy to help me out with this one.

The customer returned and brought in an ancient PC; it looked ravished and dirty

With Jeremy in the back he stepped closer to me and took a 50 dollar bill out of his pocket and took a pen out of his other. He wrote down something and folded the bill twice, if you want work that suits your qualities more give me a call”. 

Jeremy came back from the back with the waiver and the customer quickly walked away from me turning his attention to Jeremy. He signed and put down an upfront payment of 30 dollars or so; I can’t remember. It took only seconds for all of this to happen. He turned around, covering the rest of the shift alone. He worked on the computer that night and got it working. 

When I got in the next day my company polo had suddenly arrived. Jeremy probably told Ron or Don and they knew they could not withhold the polo any longer. When Jeremy saw me he walked over and asked me if I wanted to know something about that customer. I said yes. He told me he was the owner of an adult webcam site. He had tried to hire me as a performer. 

**TL:DR** we got a new store uniform. Sexual harassment ensues. 

**Challenge:** Find the new Pokemon reference.

**Question:** I’m looking to improve my writing. If anything about my story could use some more work please let me know in the comments.

* * *

I was still working for Ron replacing all the computers in the school

A very boring job

There wasn’t much to find, and not just on the desks). Then there was a diary. It belonged to a girl from my class that I had not particularly hated or liked. But some high quality intel on this girl would not hurt. I opened it up and read through it, focused on deciphering her sloppy handwriting.

I was startled when somebody walked into the room. It was a school concierge. School was to start in 2 weeks again and needed to be cleaned. The concierge (let’s call him Fred) was a moron. Not just a regular moron; he was designed to be a moron. He always did things wrong and said the most inappropriate things. And now he stood in front of me. I put down the diary; there was nothing interesting in it anyway.

“Leila,” he said. “Help with what?” I replied, a bit dazed. “My computer is broken and I need to order new cleaning supplies,” he said with with urgency in his voice.

I had no choice other than to walk down with him to his office. I then realized why this building was in such a bad state. He was like Ron, being civil wasn’t motivating him to just let the Coke can stand.

He pointed at his computer (the oldest one we had in the school), if that’s what you mean.” Good God. He was right, though: the computer looked like new.

“You also have to clean the PC every once in a while of files that are not necessary anymore — like cleaning up your desk from old documents and cans of Coke.” His world had changed. “You can do that!?” I showed him how to clean up the files and empty the trash and wrote down the instructions so he would not forget. The error was resolved, followed my instructions and thanked me. At times like this, I just wish everybody was a moron.

* * *

I was now on the first floor again

I did go in.

The cellar was poorly lit. Many of the lights had died long ago. I picked up a torch light that was in a bin next to the stairs. Fred did not come down here often enough to actually fix them

The cellar was huge. It spanned the length and width of the ground floor. Next to me were heaps and heaps of paper: storage

I walked further down to the left, and sporting equipment. I could not walk down anymore without the fear of being crushed by the contents. I walked back and tried the right side next. I quickly stumbled upon a lot of computers — really old ones. There were early 1980s and 1990s computers covered in layers of dust as old as the machines themselves.

I noticed something again. These computers formed a wall. I knew there was more space behind it because when the torch light hit the ceiling it kept on going for quite a bit. There was something behind this great wall of computers and I needed to find out. I scanned the computers and saw there was one pile that was on wheels. I pulled it out. I needed to make a note to go to the hospital to get checked out because my jaw dropped again.

It was a secret hideout. There were couches, a refrigerator, and boxes full of food and drinks. The floor wasn’t concrete. It was a lot of carpets all covering each other. What was this place?

I looked around and started one of the notebooks. I could not go past the login screen

I looked around a little more. I was behind the school now, so nobody ever went here. I spent the rest of my days imaging the PCs and wondering what the cave was for.

* * *

When school started again I went up to Werner, and finally blurted “you are not going to tell anyone right!? You cannot tell anyone!” I assured him I would not — so long as he would tell me what it was all about. He told me go to the forested area and wait there for him after school ended at four. I had to wait another 5 hours. Screw me.

I silently sneaked into the forested area and waited for Werner. I realized this was all stupid and turned to leave when Werner came up, because honestly it was. But the fact that I was associated with it just hit me wrong. Werner quickly jumped in, not taking minutes to say something for a change, and told them I had found our hideout over the summer and he was forced by me to show what it was all about.

They calmed down and reluctantly introduced themselves. They were of all ages and types of nerd. This “gaming cave, play with the electronics and most of all play video games.

I liked that and joined them for the afternoon. I was surrounded by geeks and loved it. We had so much to talk about. After an awkward first hour they relaxed and at the end of the day they regarded me as a member.

I look on the page. Nothing. The next ten minutes are spent trying to determine what he sees. Then another 10 in how he can take a screenshot and send it to me. 

Finally I get the screenshot.

A porn ad

As you might know, the user just likes to look at porn in his spare time and that's why he sees the ads. 

No biggie

Me: who's currently logged into FB?

Him: Our store manager. (His boss). 

Me: [Um....](http://stickerish.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/NothingToDoHereBlackWithTextSS.png)

I ain't explaining to you what your boss does in his spare time. Gave him a story about targeted advertising and forwarded this to the IT guys to explain next time. (Sorry). 

**TLDR: Too chicken to explain to employee his boss watches porn.**

Edit: There's been some suggestions in the comments that it wasn't a porn ad. I am 95% certain it was

Edit2: Here's the ad: http://i43.tinypic.com/10p7mv5.jpg

It's in Dutch. I'll translate:

1. Men Only!
*Only 18+ men may enter here. [Click here]


2. Challenge yourself
*Reach your target distance with smarter training schedules on MY ASICS.
*Use now

3. Beenmode.nl (leg fashion)
*Smart, for every man and woman.

Edit3: Went and talked with IT and they assured me that it couldn't be malware. They gave me several reasons that sounded plausible (to me). I hope I can reproduce them correctly.

1. We're on Citrix servers
2. Citrix servers get rebooted every weekend
3. USB-ports from computers are closed.
4. Internet outside of Citrix isn't possible
5. The person who called me was not on that particular computer but on a secure computer in the back-office.

Edit4: Now I'm wondering: is it possible for the user to download malware at home

Edit5: I've spent an hour on Reddit now. Going offline and back to work. I'll check in later.

Edit6: Thanks for all the speculation. I had a blast. Our IT guys assure me everything is fine (I showed them this thread and all your explanations) so... I'm going to go ahead and trust what they have to say. They'll keep an eye out for suspicious stuff and we're sending out a memo to never log into another user's Citrix profile.

""Now my printer does not work... what did you do to it?""

He'd worked on her system remotely after 5 the night before dealing with an issue unrelated to printers

""Nothing... didn't touch your printer or print anything.""

""NO""

As she was speaking he wasn't listening but pulling up her desktop into a remote support session. Her screen was filled with the web browser and she was playing some game on Facebook. He grabbed her cursor and minimized the mess telling her at the same instant

She tried to open Facebook again and he said

""Do you see the error?"" he circled the red area with the cursor and she said no... ""..right here on your screen... the red error that is flashing?"" Again she said ""No"" and continued saying ""I'm not at my desk now""

""Could you please go back to the desk?""

""In a minute... I'm busy""

""Aren't -you- going to fix it? Why do you need me? Can't -you- just fix it""  She croaked. God

""OK... Look at your monitor in the middle of the screen and tell me if you see... ""

""You're in my system

""Yes... Yes... thanks.... OK Now..."" and again she interrupted. ""My thing is moving. You are moving my thing""

""Yes... Yes... I am moving your thing... Now..."" He hurried. ""Do you see the red flashing thing there where your thing is moving?""

She stumbled

""Yes there... right there... please watch the screen..."" and he clicked the red error box and it opened a pop up box that said 'TONER EMPTY'.  ""Can you read that part where it says that the toner is empty?""

""This printer was working last night... Now my printer does not work... what did you do to it?""

He held an imaginary gun to his head and blew his imaginary brains into the wall and imagined for a moment the certain cool peace of the inevitable void then continued... ""The printer is out of toner.... it is empty of the black stuff that goes on the paper and makes letters...""

""I am not doing a letter. I am doing mailing labels and I just don't understand why it is that every time you work on my system I have another problem...""

There are people in this world

""Please listen to me for one second and let's work together to resolve this issue"" He used every bit of his mind not to sound like the most sarcastic fellow ever to grace the earth. ""I am on your side. I am here to help and I need your help to help me help you solve the problem.... OK?"" He continued without pause. ""Do you have a new toner cartridge?""

""Yes

""Great... I knew you could come through with a solution now please get the toner and change out the new cartridge for the old one... I'll hold""

She finally agreed and the remote experiment in dentistry neared closure.

As he held and listened to her fumble and grumble another line rang. He checked the caller ID and answered quickly. ""Hey man

""Look man

He held an imaginary gun to his head and blew his imaginary brains into the wall

""OK....!"" The customer was back. ""I changed the toner but the light is still flashing""

""OK..."" he said

The phone rang again... it was another 800 number... he let it go and continued ""Just hit the clear error button on the top of the printer...""

""I am not -at- my printer. I am -at- my desk""

""Yes... Yes... Yes, this woman was starting the day nicely.

Again the phone rang... unknown number... no time to answer unknown calls. He let it go to voice mail.

She came back to the phone. ""OK -your- error light is off"" 

""Good""

""Yes

""Wait... just one second and let me check the process and make sure we are not chasing our tails. OK?""

""OK

""It's making a noise but it is -not- printing...""

He could pat her on her precious little head

She growled

""Is anything printing?""

""Something is coming out. I don't know what it is.""

In his mind he imagined her biting off her own smoke stained tongue, ""Could you check for me?""

He heard her huff and bang her way to the printer. She had the most blank grey eyes that seemed to reflect her thought patterns. He tried to think of a happy place to calm his... the phone rang again... another 800 number. Another call he wouldn't answer 

""It is still not printing... all I have is a page that says 'Windows Test Page'... what did -you- do with my labels? "" 

""OK... great! We'll print your labels now."" He looked at her recently used documents and pulled up the first in the list. It was a label sheet but there were only 8 labels out of 30 that should have been populated

She rattled

""Oh

""Just hold on one second and we'll see what we have

""Something is printing

**The Story**

So one day a 2Lt comes down to my office and begins to tell me the issues hes having. This guy comes off as a tech savvy individual as hes explaining all the troubleshooting hes done and what the issue might be. He claims faulty power supply as the machine is dead and doesnt boot. Hes checked all the cables (sometimes students kick the power cable out of the machine) and has come to the conclusion that this is the only thing it could be. So I have him wait at the door so I can grab my book and follow him to his classroom. 

These classrooms were all put together on the military dime, because whoever designed these desks decided the kill switch should be on the front of the desk at waist level, and his is the only one without a power light on.

This is where tech savvy Lt turns into cocky power hungry Lt around his peers. He goes on to explain that the military isnt training people right and spouts off a few more belittling things about people of low ranks. This is the fun part. So instead of simply showing him that he somehow managed to press the kill switch

Puzzled and somewhat stunned the Lt bombarded me with questions of how and why that worked. I let him know that HP has been integrating Clappers into their machines for years. Of course he didnt believe me

1371736171.0,1gq5uq,Cringeworthy Tech Advice,The_Clops,980,210,350,"Gripe post. I work as an AV Tech (i.e. gain-riding button monkey) at my university's student union. This month the only thing going on is daily New Student Orientations for incoming freshmen. I run sound/lights/projection for these. We also have student orientation leaders who lead the parents around campus to and from tours and presentations and answer general questions. Let me preface this by saying that these people work much harder than I have to and god knows I couldn't stay as upbeat as they do (we start at 6:30 AM and these go on every day for a month).

Every day a few of the student leaders hold a student panel so the parents can ask questions and almost every day they are asked technical questions that they are ill-equipped to answer (though they really do try). Some of my favorites:

* *When asked what kind of computer is recommended for students:*

""Most students have laptops, but ALL of university-owned desktops are Dells. Smells like a business arrangement.  

* *When asked about WiFi:*

""You can't make your own little wireless internet yourself

* *When asked about having electronics in the dorms:*

""Communicate with your roommate because if you have 2 TVs, you can't have power strips."" *Facedesk.* They say ""voltage"" a lot, especially when explaining why microwaves are not permitted. It does not mean what they think it means. Also the university actually *recommends* that you bring power strips because the rooms only have 2-3 outlets.

Now it was during my time slinging bits and bytes for the Feds, he had declared some years back that it would ""never ever"" be a part of his party's policy after it had pretty much been the single cause of their defeat in a previous election. Of course, as it was one of his long-term pet policies, this was so much smoke and mirrors. Coming to power later on, he squeaked into a second term in office (technically actually losing the popular vote) and immediately declared that this was obviously a mandate to implement said pet tax (even though he couldn't get it supported without going to other parties). Thus, political shenanigans and power plays went on behind closed doors so he could force it into existence.  

So far

Now, presumably after all the glad-handing and subtle machinations. However, my tale comes somewhat earlier in the calendar... as in a good year or two beforehand.  
   
  
You see, and been asked if I would mind assisting with the installation of a new server. Nothing fancy, just babysitting the hardware, running a couple of tests, and generally being eyes and hands on the ground for the central server team. Nothing strange about that, right?  

Only... the server was being installed in a building my employer had never operated out of before. And indeed, as I wandered into the new site. Funny, as I hadn't heard of any new infrastructure expansion, at least through official channels...  

A quick glance through the specialist chapters of the installation procedures, ""couldn't possibly have had all the details worked out yet, no siree"" Goods and Services Tax team. The election was barely over; the money and (most importantly) details I was looking at couldn't possibly have been arranged in the time between then and now. Someone had been planning this for quite some time.  

There were a number of other discrepancies, whitewashed of any identifying nomenclature. There was even public-information frontage built on the ground floor of the building at the same time, unconnected to the hidden team in the back offices, so that no-one would express any surprise upon hearing that the Tax department was operating out of that address, or raise an eyebrow at the furniture and office kibble being trucked in. In short, it was deliberately designed so that the general public wouldn't get wind of the fact that the GST team was up and running far, far before it was ever supposed to exist even on paper.  
   
  
Our intradepartmental procedures and processes were quietly expanded to include the new server on our list of supported items, one day, many months later... ""Oh gosh, looks like the party in power got support for this GST thing after all, what a surprise!""
   
  
A surprise for some

Something happens (I don't know the specifics since I don't come in until the afternoon) and the root partition (which also happens to contain all the data) seems to be shafted. There are three middle-aged guys sitting in front of a shell sweating, they seem content since everything is back up and running (for now). I tell them ""guys, I'd really suggest that you unmount and stop using the partition while it's damaged - run fsck for jfs just to be on the safe side!"". The server does some sort of database job (they don't tell me everything) so being back up it starts writing a ton of shit to and from the disk, using the same partition. 

My boss responds with a ""Kid

I try to approach my boss again since I kinda feel bad for those egotistic assholes: ""Hey

The guy said verbatim ""uuuhhhhhh

I sit back in my chair with the biggest smug smile on my face while my boss turns incandescent red. He slams the phone in the receiver and has someone else call while he has a fit. Everybody in the IT office remained there that day except me - I just went home and felt fucking awesome.

This was almost immediately followed by a phone call from someone who needs a keyboard replacement after spilling a large iced coffee on it.  This was right near site1

Then I get a phone call from a regional office; she can't get online and wants me to stop in and see what's wrong.  This was right near site2, so I decided to put her a lower priority and handle the first two issues first.  

45 minutes pass

There are a number of things that need to be printed before she can start her week so that the right people can sign what needs to be signed.  Had I known that she was having a printer issue

""Jill

""Well you should have known.""  *(apparently I woke up in bizarro land this morning where being unable to print and being unable to get online are the exact same thing.)*

So I get over there and -- as I'm sure you'd expect -- the problem was that she didn't hit the gigantic power button on the front of her printer.   Right in the middle of rolling my eyes

""How many times have you tried?"" I asked.

""I've been trying for the past 10 minutes.""  *(TIL in bizarro world

I went back up into the server room and discovered that one of the switches was down. A quick reboot and it was all functioning again.

It then occurred to me that about half a floor of users had been [working](http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/37802895.jpg) without network for 2 hours without saying anything to IT.

1373635722.0,1i5ghq,"""You have nothing in writing"" goes both ways.",setthuzzolo,874,124,119,"This story takes place oh-so-many years ago. I was in the last year of high school and dynamic websites were fairly new. My computer science professor knew I was looking for a job and told me that a friend of his was looking for a student to work for him.

I meet up with the professor's friend who tells me the company promised a website to a *major* ambulance building company but he didn't have anybody with any experience in building a dynamic site from scratch; he only had a designer that created the mockup. He asked me if I could create something like that and I told him that although I knew HTML I never built anything like that

The deal we made was that I'd come to the office every day for a week and, how to prepare an NT server (he didn't have any linux machines) to run them, and how to use databases through Perl (that's how he wanted it). After the ten days were over I had the first draft of the website up and running. I showed the boss and asked if he'd hire me. He said that was impressive but the end product wasn't like the designer illustrated, I tried to explain ""first draft"" to him, but still said he'd want to see the finished project first. Ok.

Fast forward another week or so, the source code wasn't pretty, but the website looked and worked as requested: there was a database with all the products, the customer could choose the base vehicle, add every piece of instrumentation, get a quotation for the finished ambulance and place the order online. I also created a CMS (didn't even know it was called that at the time) so that the customer could update his database online. Doesn't seem like much now, but it was 2000 and I was a damn proud 19yo. So I show this to the boss. His answer was ""ah, now just add the price conversion in euros and fix this border"" to which I reply ""ok
""Ah no
""Ok
""Yeah

I didn't. Every day I kept coming back to the office and asked for my payment, this was a T1, it was AWESOME!), and every day I went back home. I'd have to take the train both ways and, of course, buy lunch. All this time I did nothing but nag the boss about my dues and talk to the other employees. Excluding the boss six people worked there: the designer, the incompetent hottie at the phone and four high school students that ""would be paid eventually"". These guys were working just as hard as me: one of them was preparing a linux box that would become the mail server, can't really remember what the other one did. Once

And so I downloaded stuff from kazaa and bugged my boss until the customer came back asking a progress report. The boss brought them in the employee area

Later that day the boss called me in his office to talk  
""So
""All nice and ready. I just have to copy it to the server.""  
""So
""Yup. It's been almost a month now. I have to take the train every day.""  
""And how much does it cost you?""  
""I pay X each way.""  
""So, here you go: 40X. So can you copy the site on the server?""  

That was the day the bastard learned that ""you have nothing in writing"" goes both ways. I took the money, had nothing at all to show for it, had to pay back the deposit and a penalty for half of the cost of the entire project! He had to file for bankrupcy!""  
I explained exactly how things went down and had another student that worked there confirm what I said.

Now Read On...   

----

We all have them. The calls which make us wonder if we've gently drifted from the path of sanity during a momentary lapse of attention, heedless of the passage of years and alcohol, like glass shards in the mind.  

We all have them.  

This is mine.  
   
  
It started out innocently enough. I had been working a federal government helpdesk for some months, and I had just picked up the phone to be informed that the caller, from the floor above me, was having some difficulty printing.  

Not a problem! Friendly helpdesk tech is on the case and ready to help! We shall walk through the standard troubleshooting and have the user going happily printy-printy in short order, checking all the usual software settings to no avail, and I start asking more general questions.  

- Do they get an error when they print? No.  
- Is the printer switched off? No.  
- Does the printer make printing noises when a job is sent to it? Yes.  
- Does the paper
- With the correct information on? Can't tell.  
- How about the - wait

Can't... tell?  
   
  
Is the user printing a document without viewing it? (Possible
Does the user have a file with a print format significantly different from the screen presentation? No...  
Um... is the user blind? (Never assume the obvious.) No...  
The printer IS in the same room, against the wall.  
Then... why can the user not determine what's on the printout?  

Well
   
  
Not ""the printer is a little warm"". Not even ""a sparking short is visible through the ventilation slots"". This was *""three-foot flames are leaping out of the power supply the whole time the user has been on the phone to me.""*  
   
  
I think, helpful troubleshooting, while never once considering it worth mentioning that the object of his disapproval was doing its best impression of Thích Quảng Đức.  

A second passed. Another.  

Reality, all bloody maw and sadistic vengeance. Somehow, in my stunned state, I managed to get the caller to switch the printer off at the wall and go find a fire warden. I still cannot remember writing the ticket to have a tech go up and examine the charred ruin - I'd kicked over into autopilot, and wasn't exactly *compos mentis*. The world had broken, and it would never be quite the same again.

Back to this morning.

Saw that our co hosted smtp relay was taking strain

    exim -bpc

It spat out that there was 304 messages waiting in the queue.

While not a large number

So:

    exim -bp | less

and scrolling down allowed me to find the culprit.

She sent a 2MB PDF marketing brochure to 1189 recipients

Fine.

Instead of doing the usual and walking over to educate her about our dedicated (paid for) bulk email and newsletter systems

    exim -bp | grep -A 1189 offender@abusersdomain &gt; abuserfile

I decided to pipe the output to a text file

(Oh yeah

    cat abuserfile | awk '{print $2}' | while read line; do echo -e ""Bulk Spam Detected For \n \n $line \n \n Please refrain from sending bulk spam from your account. \n Account might be disabled if behaviour continues."" | mail -s ""Bulk Mail Abuse Detected"" offender@abuserdomain ; done

I'll give it a few hours and decide if I want to send out another one

She downloaded all the emails from root

So I decided to get creative and sent her a custom delivery delay notification for the sixteen or so messages that have not been delivered yet.

I'll send delivery confirmations for the others later :D

One of the commenters indicated that I am on a bit of a power trip

Fair enough

I am not only a support staffer

Because I am senior management

Why do I not speak to her boss? Because she has been publicly berated by him recently. If I go to him I could cause her to be fired

Why do I not sit her down and have a chat with her? Because a manager from another department having a sit-down with her would cause questions to be asked

She needs to learn a lesson

**EDIT/UPDATE3**

I just went upstairs to enquire about her.

She decided not to come back after her meeting. I let one of her colleagues in on my prank and she told me that the section boss used the bulk mail system yesterday

She remarked that ""... she does as she pleases. He told her to use the bulk mailer. Keep spamming her. She has to learn.""

1372340956.0,1h6en8,Lack of hours lack of pay and the people you entrusted your network too.,TenTonAir,924,178,395,"So I work at a local community college.  Recently because of the way part time workers above 30 hours now get health benefits in the United States suddenly everybody who was working as a part timer now gets their hours cut. This hurts especially for the entire department of people they had at 39.

So all the part timers in our department got together and I was chosen to speak with the dean of our local campus to discuss the issue of pay and hours. We discussed that this wasn't a healthy work environment because we were encouraged to do our jobs poorly because of how they do their pay. Our hours had been cut before for doing 'too much work' and so on and we were sick of getting paid less than home depot employes and no benefits we argued that they if they had budgeted a ton of money (roughly six million dollars) to their new admin offices they could budget a little bit of extra cash for fair wages. We said it's silly to pay us to little when we handle equipment that's easily worth several times our monthly wages and we handle all this sensitive data and network administration that goes into keeping a campus running.




 So after what I thought was a good meeting we find out that not only are our hours being cut but we're also being knocked down to below 20 hours a week. Even the people who have worked here five+ years and suddenly the dean who's always made time for talks is suddenly too busy in his office doing paperwork to have meetings.

1361898944.0,199nkt,My dad's tales from the trenches 3: Don't screw with the police.,EtanSivad,872,124,100,"My dad worked for IBM tech support for a bit over a decade

The names in this story are made up to protect the idiotic.  

One day my dad gets a call from a police precinct in a medium sized town where they have an AS/400 that serves 5 different police stations and a few fire stations connect in as well. 

Caller: ""This is Sergeant Murphy.  We've got an AS/400 system here that serves our precinct and we had to fire one of the system administrators by the name of Frank for being lazy and incompetent not to mention repeated issues with him not showing up to work.  You'd think this would be the end of it, or he'd destroy our computer systems and there's nothing we could do to stop him.""

Dad: ""Wow.  So what did you do?""

Caller: ""well

Dad: ""Understood.  I'll get connected and take a look.""

My dad remotely connects to their system and starts looking around.  First thing he does is runs a query to see all users with remote access privileges.  He can see that Frank's account has been deactivated.  So he's not getting in that way.

All of the users have full names like ""BobSmith"" but two of them stand out.  BD1 and BD2 (Back-door1 and 2).  Looking at a query of those two users, the user JohnDoe was created by Frank's account.  It  was logged in once to create the two users Bd1 and Bd2, than promptly deleted by Frank's account.  

My dad disables those two accounts and starts digging deeper.  Surely this couldn't be his master plan.  A couple of users - that's it?    He once commented that this was the really fun part because he started thinking about if you wanted to put a time bomb in the system, scheduled restore jobs, scheduled deletion, so on and so forth.  

My dad got this call because he was considered at that time the foremost security expert on the As/400.  He was left severely disappointed because the guy didn't do anything even remotely sneaky or clever.  Only made a couple of remote access accounts and didn't cover his tracks very well in hiding who made them.  So he calls the Sergeant back and tells him what he's found.

Caller: ""Really that's it?  That's too bad.  I was hoping he'd done a bit more damage so we could charge him with more.  If he had remotely connected

Dad: ""Oh

Caller: ""Really?  Could you write up a list of things he potentially could have done to disrupt us?  No matter how small.""

Dad writes up a list of everything you could do with elevated privileges.  From deleting users, he probably never would have thought of half the things on the list.

He faxed the list over to the Sergeant (because faxing is how you rolled in the 90s!) and Sergeant called him back laughing hysterically.

Caller: ""This is great Dan!  I'm sending this to the D.A.'s office right away!  What kind of moron threatens the police and demands a job from them?  The D.A. is going to have a field day with this one.""

* * *

Don had taken his sweet time introducing me to Alex that morning. Though honestly he should not have taken the effort; I already knew Alex better than I cared for. He went on and on about the skills this new computer prodigy had demonstrated during his job interview

After the introduction he told me something I was afraid of hearing all along: I had to to train Alex. Don made sure to put strong emphasis on wanting me to train him; I was the chosen one.

This was going to be a long shift.

I reluctantly walked to the back to stow away my coat and bag into my locker; it only took a minute. I wanted to stall going back into the store, readjusting my clothing, checking my cellphone for new messages... Nothing that really helped my cause. Letting out a huge sigh I went back into the store.

Alex was still standing behind the counter when I came back. I decided to play the busy game and told him I had a lot of things that needed to be done before I could start training him. I pointed at 12 boxes of all kinds of electronics that needed to added to the shelves. He could do that and get himself familiarised with the store that way.

I checked the inventory system

It did not matter much anyway as checking inventory was something that rarely needed to be done since Don and Ron just brought in random boxes at all times

Alex seemed desperate for some attention at this moment and kept asking me constantly where each of the electronics needed to be placed. I knew that he wasn’t stupid and could perfectly well find his way around the store. He had been here so many times over the months. 

About an hour in

As there were no customers in the store I showed him the back where we keep most of the stock

I was on my knees at this moment taking out an mp3 player when he started coming a little close for comfort. I back off and stood up quickly

I started going down the list of customers who needed to be notified that their repaired PCs and orders could be picked up. I was busy calling the customers on the list as another customer walked into the store. Alex took initiative for the first time. Rather awkwardly he walked up to a middle aged woman and started to introduce himself. 

“Hi, pulled out a Logitech G15 keyboard and told her she needed this one. No discussion possible. It was a keyboard that we sold for 140 dollars.

I had been listening and watching from the beginning and felt I needed to step in for the sanity of this woman. I quickly took over the conversation and pointed her to a 20 dollar keyboard that would do the job just fine. When she was gone I talked to Alex and made it clear that we don’t work on commission and our preferences don’t count.  I sent him to the back with a list of computers he could fix. He wasn’t any better at that.

The next two or three days were mostly the same story with him receiving negative attention from me because he kept messing up no matter what he did or how I dealt with him. Negative attention, maybe even actively asking for it. He was clingy, always asking the same questions — simple questions he could have easily solved himself.

It wasn’t until a month later that he started to become more than just annoying and moved into the territory of being creepy. It was one Saturday morning that I found a love note in my locker. It was barely intelligible because of the messy handwriting. 

Leila

I now have worked with you for a month and have seen you much longer than that. I asked you out once and you said no. Maybe now that you know me better I can ask again and get a yes. I really believe you are the one

Alex

I wasn’t happy with this note and felt it had dragged on long enough. He was already in the store and I walked up to him and pushed the note into his chest. “I already have a boyfriend, but I really did not want this situation go on any longer. He needed to know that I did not want him or his constant peering on me.

“Just leave me alone

When I told him,” and just left, leaving me to handle the entire store alone. He didn’t return and I called Frank to see if he could fill in for Alex. Afterwards I called Don telling him about what happened. He wasn’t happy with Alex but completely ignored the rest of what I told him.

I did not feel safe that day and when I was to leave around the end of the afternoon

After that, he was with me for the entire shift as Alex never showed up. He didn’t for his next shifts either. I was happy he was gone but it did not feel right. Something would happen.

At home I started to receive postcards with love notes and even flowers. He somehow found out my private cellphone number and started calling at the most random times

This was ongoing for about 2 weeks and I had been in contact with the police several times. They had told me there was very little they could do at the moment and I should keep all the postcards

In those two weeks I had been surrounded by my friends, Frank and Richard were covering my shifts. Frank and Richard were very supportive of me and didn’t like Alex either. If they had their chance they would work their magic.

Around the three week mark we had a store meeting. The store meetings had become a mandatory thing every month since the new year. I went with Jeremy to see if I could start working at the store again. I was not going to back down for Alex.

At the store

He started shouting “JEREMY IS YOUR BOYFRIEND, but to me and Jeremy. Frank and Richard seemed like they wanted to high five Jeremy, but Ron and Don for some reason gave a disapproving look to the both of us. I still don’t know what that was about. 

“Just leave, you deformed piece of shit, go back to the hole you came from and die.” I was taken aback by the aggression in Jeremy’s voice. I didn’t know who to be afraid of anymore.

Alex started throwing computers on the floor and broke a monitor while doing it. Don and Ron hadn’t really done anything during the fight but only now stepped in because they were going to be hit financially. “You don’t work here anymore and are not welcome here anymore. Now you better pull out your wallet and pay me or I will call the cops

The cops pulled up fifteen agonising minutes later. They arrested Alex and had proof this time. The cameras installed by Ron had recorded everything. I was free.

**How do I open the fucking internet?!**One man, so it wouldn’t fit the standard little scanner we had at the time.  I directed him to the self-serve computers, which had a larger scanner.  To this day, I do not know why the full-service production area had only an 8.5X11 scanner, but the self serve had one large enough to do architectural drawings.  Nor do I understand why we could not own at least one scanner somewhere in the middle for size.  He sat at the rental computer, which was visually obscured from my workspace in the back of the store, and after about 20 minutes of evident frustration he surprised everyone in the store, when he shouted across the entire store “How do I open the fucking internet?!”  I went to him and calmly assisted 

“click on the internet explorer icon”

“The what?”

“The button that looks like a blue e with a yellow halo”

“How do I click it?”

“…with the mouse.”

He then picked up the mouse off of the counter, I couldn’t spend my whole night helping one person email a piece of paper.   I convinced him to leave his task with us behind the counter as a full-service job.  I went and did it on the big scanner in self-service when the store was empty.

**Bernoulli disk**One gentleman brought in the file for his business cards on a Bernoulli disk.  This was in 2009.  If you don't know what a Bernoulli disk is, somewhere, at some point asked  “What is that?  Is that a hard drive? A CD case?  Baking chocolate?”  That’s where the story ends, when we couldn’t use his disk he left, confused, and never came back.  I assume he got into his DeLorean, cranked up his Buddy Holly 8-track

**Wynne #2 -  Eric opens a Factbook account** She later called for helping setting up a “Factbook” account but when the new person didn’t understand they asked her to come into the store for us to help her.  The new guy Eric was friendly and helpful.  He was not yet broken and also not yet experienced in making Wynne go away, as I was supposed to be training him.  Wynne and Eric were still finding Wynne’s extended family, in-laws, and removed cousins when I called him on the P.A. saying he had a call holding for him.

**Fake ID’s**  Three kids from a fraternity came in around 10:00PM.  I didn’t know their exact ages, unlike the usual frat boys, these three were amazing quiet.  Suspiciously quiet, much like when seven year olds are playing and you hear a loud bang, followed by silence, followed by hurried whispering.  I tried to sneak up on them, but it was difficult in my work shoes.  I got close enough to see they had scanned in one of their drivers licenses and were attempting to Photoshop in pictures of the other two guys into it and change the birthdates.  One of them had a copy already printed… on regular weight paper…  cut out with scissors….  and the font was different on the birth date than the rest of the ID.  The real kicker though – In Washington state, under 21 years old gets a portrait layout on their driver’s license while over 21 get a landscape layout

If you want more of these let me know, pissed his pants while sitting in the chair and then just walked out laughing like he’d bested us somehow.  Lots of amateur porn, including a gay trio who had me help design an entire 12-month calendar of their own S&amp;M pictures.  I don't want to know why the three of them ordered 5 copies.  Also a woman who was banned from the store for threatening another patron by picking up her miniature poodle and lunging it at them like a weapon.  I’ll stop here for now because these just keep coming back like ‘nam.

I work at a highschool ""district"" (idk if district is the right word

1.  While giving a presentation going through documents in his Google Drive (in IE, he couldn't figure out how to get from one document back to the drive view.  We told him to just close the foreground window.  He moves his mouse in circles looking around.  ""Just click the red x"" *moves mouse in more circles* ""In the top right corner of the screen"" *keeps moving mouse in circles in complete confusion*.  Finally I stand up and walk up to the screen and point to the elusive red x in the top right corner of the screen and he clicks it.  The presentation continues.

2.  Someone was giving us a formal overview of our Citrix environment (as basic as you can get), ""What is an 'app?'  Could you give me an example of what an 'app' is?""  After we realized he was serious, we told him that Microsoft Word would be an example of an 'app'.

3.  Back to Google Drive, clicks the alignment down-arrow and selects center.  Then he clicks in the 2nd cell and clicks the alignment down-arrow, and selects center again.  He does this on a touchpad for about 20 rows with an entire audience watching and waiting.  Because god knows, you can't apply formatting to more than one cell at once.

4.  We have a very high end network with segregated ports and wifi (with repeaters) so we can control who can have internet access and who can access network devices and such.  Like you do.  We had a misconfigured WAP in one room at a campus and we we couldn't access it remotely

* Two Windows 2003 servers riddled with viruses (running DHCP
* Two Linux servers for which noone has passwords and noone even knows what they're doing.
* About 40 workstations
* A hodge-podge of network gear by different vendors
* No backups of any of their data (not that they didn't have an online backup account provided by us or anything... The IT Manager just never bothered to set it up).
* No antivirus installed on any machine. We found The IT Manager wandering around with a USB stick with a portable copy of AVG Free Personal edition on it

About a week went by before I received my first call for a job. It was from a guy who wanted to have his sons computer repaired. And I knew that address very well as it was right by my old highschool

Gorgeous house, right?

I get to his room, it ended up being malware, no biggie. I let his parents know that I charged $20 for the virus removal and $20 for the visit. They gave me $80, awesome. I go back in to take care of business.

I was done within 10 minutes, so I offered to install some free virusprotection, clean the hdd/registery, etc..  He happily agreed, and decided to sit on the bed next to me as I did this.

At this point, and all he kept repeating was that I fixed it and it's done. His dad insisted that I stay to install the antivirus so it doesn't happen again. As awkward as a spot this put me in, It wasn't the kid who was paying me.

I grabbed a free firewall + antivirus

As I am about to open this drive

I open it up

In this coveted ""DL"" folder. This kid had more porn in there than my friends and I combined. Keep in mind, gang bangs, softcore, you name it, he had it.

How did I know all of this? Because his thumbnails were set to large display, with conservative values. I'm also pretty sure he didn't know wth was going on in his childs private life.

Now im sitting here feeling awkward as all hell

His dad tried to gather his composure

TBH, the woman in yoga pants down stairs.. Holy jebus.

I open it up and it was riddled with pictures and videos of her in the garden, etc.

He steps away for a minute. I am getting ready to leave cause I know this ain't going to be pretty. But I guess it was the fatehrs intention to ridicule his son for punishment

They had me go through all of his porn (Like open it up and play some of it) and then go through some of her pics

At this point I realized that the father was probably a little crazy, it was actually pretty wild.

Now read on...
   
  
   
So there I was in my job with much free time on my hands, a database of various user and system issues and errors, along with their associated fixes. Because I am a neat and industrious little bunny like that, and also a little picky when it comes to quality documentation.

Now, along with their email addresses. You never know when you might need such a thing, after all. So this I do. These techs, being much like myself, were generally the only person in their respective offices who knew which end of a computer was up. None of us were in an office team; we were all singletons.
   
  
   
And as things go, usually on the occasion that a user transferred over and wanted a copy of their profile to go with them. Fairly straightforward. And as things would have it, we would sometimes chat about various problems we'd run into and swap or brainstorm solutions.

Given that I was overseeing one of the larger offices, I had compiled the largest and most comprehensive database in only a few months. Not terribly surprising, perhaps.

Only once I innocently revealed the existence of said database during an email exchange, he told one of the other techs, who also wanted a copy. And so on.

Eventually, and also for any updates. And I was happy to share. Only I thought, as one tends to do, ""What if someone at one of the other sites has knowledge that isn't in the database? Wouldn't it be more useful being shared too?"" So I set up a little mailing list with all these techs in it, and mailed them updates, and asked for their input. And lo and behold, most of them hit Reply-All
   
  
   
Now, the floodgates kinda opened. There was a lot of back-and-forth, and, well, some techs were waxing loquacious and others were kinda getting lost in the background. Complaints were made. And then I got An Email.

This particular Email (with the capital letter) came from the state helpdesk, that they considered themselves the only source of information allowed to techs in less exalted offices, and that what I was doing was Propogating Potentially Dangerous Information to Largely Untrained Personnel.
   
  
   
I... may have made the mistake, by the way, had provided more training and solutions to the office techs than the initial single day of training at state HQ and subsequent deafening silence ever had. Oh, and I'd also based it off a similar setup which was being run very successfully in the next state over to great acclaim. Oh, and our FPOC issue resolution statewide was significantly up, meaning that we really didn't actually NEED the state helpdesk for anything any more.
   
  
   
Yeah.
   
  
   
Things... did not go well after that. Management became involved

It wasn't until I was transferred out of that position entirely that I later found out the resolution and training improvements had not gone unnoticed, and shoot the breeze in the same place: the now-empty section at the State HQ.
   
  
   
Then there was the time I broke national security in thirty seconds flat...

I brushed off most things, but today, today sucked. The day started normally, browsed reddit for a while, read some manga, had breakfast at the office, but a call would end my patience. Anyways, before I went there

He screamed at me for not being able to fix it, the customer screamed at me for not fixing it, even though it was working fine yesterday, and the people there were stupid as fuck, because they have 2 connections, 1 router that's not connected to anything and is used as a lan/network utility, and a router that has internet and wifi on it. Turns out

Just as I finished explaining that to them, and yelled at me because I didn't explain to them which router they should use wifi from. Again, I said nothing, but the last drop was when, for some reason, the lan cable going to a computer was not working well and had to be cut and replaced; my boss proceded to check and said it wasn't the problem but the computer itself, I said fuck it, he screamed at me

1370998650.0,1g5wny,Security and Hubris: Or what drove me to perform my first firing,The_Beasts_Belly,861,139,385,"**Background:** I am a very high-level IT person at a major defense company

**The Story:** About a year ago we finished our shiny new datacenter and with it, with a bachelors in Computer Science and specialized in security.  I put him on tier-1 help-desk for a few months while he proved himself, but 3 months ago I decided he was ready for the major league and promoted him to level-1 server administration (Deploying new servers, basic troubleshooting, etc).   I supervise his work for a month and only experiences a few missteps, but nothing major.

Now in our datacenter we run everything on Virtual Machines and we have a couple templates for the virtual hardware ranging from our small (1 vCPU, 32 GB RAM, 128 GB disk for OS and 4 TB of iSCSI).  The servers are usually set up in groups of 8 and put behind the load balancer.

For the operating systems

But I digress

Steve gets a couple tickets for Web servers, he replies that he is working as fast as Linux is allowing him (what with reboots, etc), turns out he was installing some weird -buntu distribution in the datacenter as opposed to any of our supported OSes.  I immediately tell him to stop and that now he has to go and migrate all the machines to one of our supported OSes.

He gets it all migrated back over the next week and I think all is good

But I was wrong.

The following week I get a report that a server that Steve set up was running slow.  I log into to check on the cluster to see its usage; CPU, weird.  I get Steve into my office he sits down, pulls out his laptop and sets it down on my desk.

Once logged in he fires up PuTTY and what he types next made me go white and then dark red in the face:
 &lt;Servername&gt;.&lt;ourdomain&gt;.com and enter.  A login banner pops up

I am pissed at this point (It is very hard to get me to be angry

**Me:** Why are you able to log into that machine

**Steve:** Don't worry

I pull his laptop over to me and look at the server he just logged into.  Yep, no firewall enabled...  Looking at the output of ps and see a single process using as many resources it can.  The process was a Java applet, odd since we don't use Java here...  No logs on the system (all were cleared and syslog turned off).  Dumping the list of active connections on the machine and I see a whole mess of connections to single machine over port 80 and a single connection to an odd IP over an odd port.  I called up the end user of the server and they have no idea what any of this was so I turned off the machine and submitted it to our Anti-Malware team to look at it.

I kept Steve in my office while the anti-malware team looked at the machine.  A few minutes later I get a call from them saying that apparently a foreign nation's cyber warfare group managed to SSH into the machine and install some sort of DDoS tool (root password was apparently set to 'access').   At this point I get on the phone with Security and have a guard come up to my office.  Then called HR to start some paperwork.

It was an average Monday morning at the office: production was behind schedule,000 from the company account over the weekend. Nobody knew anything about it.

The FedEx truck arrived right on schedule with the deliveries that had accumulated over the weekend, the ladies did what they always do when they were confused — they called me.    
""Know what these are?"" one asked as I entered the room. Both were staring intently at their computer monitors

All it took was a brief glance for me to see what they were asking about. Five enormous boxes marked ""DELL"" sat in the corner
""Nope

Pete started to get anxious after lunch

It was impossible for Pete to sneak the packages past the office manager's door
""What are those?"" he asked as Pete pushed his cart past for the third time.    
""My development servers
""Where did they come from?""    
""I ordered them Friday evening.""    
The office manager was clearly becoming agitated. ""How much did you spend on them?""    
""Just $20
""What budget?""    
Pete ignored him and continued to push his little cart.

It took the rest of the day to piece the story together. Faced with the reality that such powerful computers existed in the server room, and for his development server to dwarf every piece of hardware in the server room combined.

Before we start I'd like to state that everything here is 100% true and actually happened



For this story you will need to know a few variables:


$me1 = Middle Eastern Country 1 - We here in the US have an off and on relationship with them


$me2 = Middle Eastern Country 2 - We here in the US are pretty cool with them.


This story also involves the UK but it's easier just to write UK


You also need to know that my boss and owner was from $me1 and his family was/is very well connected in the $me1 govt.  He also was (by nature of his culture) very very secretive.


So here we go...



The company I was working for at the time had a lot of dealings with overseas companies, websites, custom apps, and hosted desktops.  We also did work for various gov't entities in the middle east as well, enough things that I would always be ""randomly selected"" for enhanced screenings at the airport.



One thing you have to keep in mind while reading this is that alot of these companies and even some of the gov't bodies do not have alot of money or they are unable to run mainstream software.  So as such we used ALOT of Linux and open source solutions for them.



We were asked by $me1 to migrate their email from a software called scalix to Zimbra.  So go I go about to determine the scope of the project and everything seemed pretty normal except for the fact that ALL of the email existed on the scalix website.  No pst files and nothing to import



Here is where I made my first mistake....for some reason (and to this day I don't know why) I created a dummy account on the zimbra system with MY NAME not a generic user like ""import"".  



Here was my second mistake...I didn't know enough about the program or IMAP on scalix/zimbra to know that it would migrate the emails over as unread and then if they were indeed read would then mark them unread.  (so in essence it would ""read"" the emails)



So the first user I start with is the CEO since he has the largest mailbox and needs his emails first.  I start my program and watch as the emails fly by hundreds at a time.  I think all is well and goto lunch.



I come back from lunch and my boss runs in my office pale as a ghost (and he's from the Middle East) and says something I will never forget as long as I live....



**""The office of the finance minister for the country of $me2 is on the phone and wants to talk to you""**



I found out then that the company we were contracted with was basically the central bank of $me1



Here is what happened....When the emails were imported into the import account (my FULL NAME) they were marked read, but what countries gave them money and travel plans for visiting dignitaries.  That's when Tony Blair's office called, because he was scheduled to visit the region and they were concerned that someone had seen the schedule (for security reasons)



It took at least 5 hours to get everyone that contacted us settled down



Just so happens on my way home that night as I turned into my neighborhood I hit a checkpoint where they were verifying insurance

After a day she was smiling like she'd won the lottery, so I just asked if I could help her out.  She very bluntly told me to have her call Jane ASAP, then hung up.  Being use to rude user, I didn't think much of it, so I just emailed Maria and didn't think of it after that.  A short time later, Maria came back and asked me questions about Jane, she had that abused dog look again.  I told her about the call I took, and went back to her desk.  I found out yesterday that all of this came to a head.  

Turns out Jane was calling into our office demanding to speak to Maria, who had made their environment so hostile that people were quitting left and right.  Seems the last company Maria worked at was family owned, and Jane was part of the Family.  Jane apparently needed a job and they put her in charge of the help desk, where she was going to ""Motivate"" the techs into shape.  

She imposed crazy rules, and found that her work load multiplied every time someone quit.  When Jane started to demand she put in long days to resolve issues, but denied all raises in their department, Maria had enough and just quit.  Then Maria came to work for us, and the less hostile environment was like a breath of fresh air.  

Apparently the loss was affecting Janes department, to the point of threatening to come down and find Maria herself.  She said that Marias resignation wasn't acceptable, and that our company wasn't going to be allowed to steel her employees without catching hell.  

I was told that the matter was taken up by the police, and is capable of running her own team if she wanted to, she can handle most any issue without any expense in energy.  I've seen her handle network issues like they were nothing and juggle tickets like a circus clown juggles balls.  She's confident and skilled better than most people I know.  So I wonder what Jane put her through to make her so scared every time she called.

Background: I work for a medium-large sized university help desk. I've been there a while so I get to deal with the faculty and staff. Anyone who has done university IT realizes that it is probably a miracle any of us who deal with faculty are able to function without a constant drip of alcohol feeding into our systems.

On campus, *Poof*, no more email for you (which is an incredibly difficult concept for so very many recent graduates to understand.

Help desk on a Saturday is usually slow. A ""my password just decided not to work today"" here, I can't use it at all today and you need to fix it now"" there. But every so often you get the most dreaded of calls: a nemesis. Now, I know what you are thinking. You're thinking, ""But Azar, isn't that a bit dramatic? Can your help desk really have a nemesis?"" To which I respond, ""Of course not. A help desk does not have just one nemesis!""

Today I have done battle with the ""Uneducated Elaborator"". 

Story Time: I walk into work today and a soon-to-be-tormented colleague begins to tell me what he is dumping onto my day

STBTC: Azar, but he had to hang up and put more time on his calling card.

Me: ...Alright...what was the trouble?

STBTC: We couldn't figure out how to setup his other email account to move the email.

Me: Should be easy enough.

Lo and behold, piercing chagrin set into my bones. The Uneducated Elaborator has found my line.

Me: Thank you for calling the help desk

UE: Ah yes

*Five minutes later*

UE:...so can you help me get this email migrated?

Me: Sure. I actually wrote the instructions you were sent so lets see if we can get these worked out.

We have a remote connection tool that gives us control over their computer and I walk him through getting connected. I see he already has Windows Live Mail installed and running and his school email address is already added. All we need to do is add his gmail account

Me: Alright sir

UE: Alright where do I type now?

Me: Right here. First we need your username.

He types his username.

Me: And here we will need your password.

UE: My What?

Me: The password for your Gmail account.

UE: I never was prompted for a password. You see I've never had a gmail account before and your colleague helped set one up. He said...

*Another 5 minutes later*

UE: ...And so I've never set up a password on this account.

I assure him he must have set one up before in order to use the account

The web browser was open and there was his Gmail account already logged in.

Me: Alright sir

UE: I never logged in here. 

...I logged him out of Gmail

Me: Alright sir

UE: Alright

Me: ...Its the name of the account we were just in. The one you said you setup just a few minutes ago.

UE: I never setup a username. I never have used Gmail before. Your colleague helped me out over the phone and I have this old email address I used before Y2K...

*An epoch passes. I see the full life cycle of entire species crawl before my deadened gaze*

UE: ...So I really just have no idea what this password could be.

I take him to the area where he can retrieve his password. To save time I start filling in some of the information for him. Then he drops the big one.

UE: ...and so I just have no idea how to get this all working. Oh

The entirety of Gmail is covered in Google logo's but I hold back my desire to flip the nearest table I can find.

Me:...uh...yes sir. Gmail is a Google product. The G stands for Google. 

UE: OHHH! I've got me one of those. You see I have a YouTube account...

NOW READ ON...

**CHAPTER 2**  
*""Declare the pennies on your eyes...""*  
   
It was with some trepidation that I touched down in the new city. Particularly as it was about the size of what Australians tend to call a large country town, it made the news. This place had a summer like I remembered winter, and a winter like nothing on earth.  

Welcome to the frozen heart of the federal public service.  

So I got a taxi, by my new employer, as rents in that town would have made even Sir Edmund Hilary think twice about tackling them.) Signing paperwork and retrieving keys, I made it back to my new home base at around 10am - unslept, unshaven, unwashed, wearing that wonderfully formal Australian leisurewear referred to as tracky-dacks

I decided, given that I only had a street address. Fortunately, some perusal of a map, and ignoring the hammering in my head, I figured it was not all that far away at all - just on the other side of the park across the street. In fact, it was so close that I could probably go and have a quick peek at it to find out where the front door was, given that I was supposed to be starting work there, *the very next morning.*  

 

This in mind, flip-flops, and stubble, I stumbled through the park doing an impromptu impression of either a one-man zombie uprising or the local inebriate three sheets to the wind. The paths twisted and turned (probably a little more than normal, given my lack of sleep), but I eventually found my way to the far end and was faced with a giant set of buildings, all apparently blithely unencumbered with any such thing as street numbering.  

Much lurching up and down the street later, connected in various ways at their upper levels. Which one would I need to enter upon the morrow?  

It was thus that a weaving, could be seen staggering suspiciously around the base of several federal buildings, peering blearily into each doorway, when all of a sudden I rounded a corner and came face to face with someone in standard office clothing, obviously taking a smoke break outside one of the emergency fire doors, away from the keen wind. The bloke in question was grimacing, puffing, in approximately that order

I introduced myself, admitted that I was starting work in that very building tomorrow morning, and would be most obliged to have the front doors pointed out to me. This earned me a slow, evaluating look up and down, and the smoker pointed towards the base of the next building over.  

 

And that was how I met my new boss.

And then people started hitting ""reply all...""

From ""I don't think I was supposed to get this, to ""For the love of god, everyone stop hitting 'reply all'!""

I'm not sure about the long term consequences. Short term, until mid-afternoon, when finally, they gave up. As a result, e-mails voicemails were showing up hours after they had been left, if at all, causing a deluge of calls to our helpdesk, and the perpetrator lost their network access

Now read on...

   
  
   
Well

**This** post is about a stunt I pulled to achieve multiple things simultaneously for minimum effort.  

---

See, there were a couple of things yet to do on my list. These included:

* Scoring some credentials for my CV and to wave around
* Having a chat to the CEO in person
* Monumentally pissing off the office manager one last time

   
  
   
So I used my free hours to sit back and consider how to achieve all of this together. And after a while, and asked for a week off. Given that this would decrease the amount of drama occurring when the office manager (her boss) was in my vicinity, she readily agreed. And I went back to my desk and made a couple of long-distance calls, then booked a flight.

On the day before my vacation

   
  
   
The weekend saw me on a red-eye flight out of the city, all my props fit into a single clipboard, and everything else was in my head.  

Monday, asking politely for ten minutes on the relevant Board member's schedule, if they would be so kind.  

This included the CEO.  

So I spent Monday through Wednesday happily chatting with the Ultra-Bosses about this and that, and happy to play up the angle that people at home would love to hear all about anything coming down the pipeline. Thusly, I gave myself a crash course in talking to CxOs and picking up relevant HQ-specific jargon, phrases, and mindsets.  

Then came Thursday.

   
  
   
Thursday, they were out in the public-contact offices and state offices, not in the National office.  

Well, like a certificate, for the person who submitted the most ideas in a year? It'd give the program a little publicity, a little boost, a little legitimacy. It might even encourage more submissions, which had been tailing off.  

Why yes

Great, I coincidentally have here with me a fully designed and printed certificate stating so, needing only your signature. Of course, I'd be more than happy to provide details and assist the I&amp;I program with any writeups it wanted!  

She signed it. Stage One: Complete.

   
  
   
Friday was the big one. Friday, she was interested in shaking things up, and she'd never before had a bottom-rung employee ask to talk to her directly about something other than a complaint. This made me oddly intriguing, and I got my ten minutes.  

I spent the time rabbiting about a half-assed idea for rewarding employees who generated cost savings with either a percentage in cash or access to things like spare executive furniture and better coffee makers for the office. I didn't expect it to go anywhere (although if it had, anyway. My real reason for being there was to be seen as a really nice guy. A solid, reliable, dependable employee who really liked the organisation, and was enthusiastic about the direction the CEO was taking it in. Because as we finished up, she walked me out past her secretary, and at that moment I asked if I could get a photo of us together. With this camera I just happened to have brought along with me.  

There was a loooooong pause. I grinned brainlessly at the secretary, I had a photo of me and the CEO, standing in the CEO's chambers in the heart of central HQ. Stage Two: Complete.

I flew home, I took it to work.

   
  
   
Now

I put that photo of me and the CEO up exactly where his eye would fall whenever he looked my way. And I made sure that everyone in my section (and thus via gossip, and it looked a lot like the Very Top Brass had taken something of a personal shine to me. Stage Three: COMPLETE.

Soon after

...and *that* is going to be my very last story - at this office

&gt;A six pack of Shiner needs to be in the fridge on Friday afternoon. Get on that.

I called the practice manager (who, since she heads up about 100 non-hospital clinics for my employer), and she told me to come over after lunch that day and she'd make sure everyone was available. The CNA had given me a list of asset tags for the laptops there, but I couldn't do it remotely because I didn't know if the laptops were on and in use at the time, and who trusts users to get it right?

After a filling lunch at Whataburger, and found the PM. She gave me her master key to let me into everywhere, and off I went. It took about two hours or so to do the laptops and desktops in the non-sterile areas (recovery, pre-surgery prep, intake, et cetera). I'd ended up both setting the update frequency to never and deleting jucheck.exe to make COMPLETELY certain that it could never update. Better safe than sorry.

Eventually, so I scrubbed up (and sinks that are operated with foot pedals are AWESOME, by the way) and stepped over the red tape into the sterile area.

I started working my way down the line of operating rooms, and eventually there was only one room left. This one was a live operating room, and they were performing surgery in it while I was working. I knew I had to wait until I was done, but curiosity compelled me to look through the window on the door just to see if I could get an idea of where they were in the procedure.

In retrospect, because that would have meant the table would have been facing the other way, and I would have been spared.

We sold an app that streamed music over a LAN from your computer to a set of remote speakers. I had done a lot of work on the networking for this app

The problem was that the user's stream would disconnect after a few minutes. But, seriously.

I'll omit the roughly one month of highly confused e-mail conversation that ensued between the user and me. The user was extremely nice and helpful

After getting lots of diagnostics and even adding some more to the app just for this guy, so I'll try to explain things, and my apologies if I'm being too obvious:

The app streamed music by breaking it up into small (fractions of a second) chunks, UDP is a kind of ""fire and forget"" protocol where you send one packet of data at a time and then it may eventually be received by the other end. There's no attempt to verify delivery or throttle the rate at which data is sent or anything like that. You, the programmer, are responsible for checking for packet loss, retransmitting as necessary, etc.

The app worked with both IPv4 and IPv6. In our experience, this is relevant.

All network interfaces have an MTU, the ones that web sites use) send a stream of data, so when they hit the MTU limit they can just break their data into smaller chunks and retry. UDP has no such facilities, but the lowest-level IP layer will automatically fragment UDP packets that are too large, and reassemble them on the other end.

Finally, that's how it worked.

I finally discovered that this user had somehow set an MTU of 1200 bytes on his network interface. Neither of us knew how or why, there were occasionally packets that exceeded 1200 bytes. Instead of fragmenting them, the OS returned an error to the app. Upon seeing the error, the app terminated the stream.

So why did classical work while rock and roll triggered the error? Well, rock music had occasional bits that didn't compress well enough to fit, and it disconnected.

The user didn't need his 1200-byte MTU

**E has been fired.** He will be leaving the company at the end of this month and is now coming in only to pass things on to his replacement.

The boss who gave E the login info to begin with has been reprimanded (not sure on the details) and he will no longer have access to this information. He put the company at a huge risk (beyond E's stupidity)

According to E: Apparently, what was going to happen in a couple months when larger pieces of data ran out of space? This was clearly a design flaw on the part of the IT guy. The IT guy clearly couldn't handle such a simple task, and was surely just going to blow E off if he tried to tell him about it (as he had been blown off in the past when giving suggestions - surely this is a sign of his incompetence), so it was just easier to take things into his own hands. 

Staying logged in as root was a mistake. He had planned to log out and use his own log in, oops! He thought it was just dealing with the size limit on his personal folder, not the entire server. That wouldn't have happened if the IT guy used UNIX instead of dumbed-down Linux. Linux makes these kinds of mistakes easy, which is why he keeps telling the IT guy to use UNIX... but the IT guy just keeps blowing him off.

His mind converted these to ""When the IT guy isn't around"" and ""When someone new needs to do something IT related."" - both applied to the E situation. E had been part of the original starting team

I have to actually put a good word in for our management. They apparently listened to the IT guy explain what had actually happened, etc. They apparently weren't deliberating over who was at fault, but more about the best way to discipline the boss and E. The IT guy was kind of scared that they would flop the blame over on him as he has been working here for about half the time as E and the boss... but they were actually sensible about the whole thing.

1342639731.0,wrxfr,xpost -- The Tale of the Craziest Client,narelie,786,108,171,"****EDIT: I have added the full story in links in a comment****

Ok, to keep within limit. I'm also reposting this from TalesFromRetail, at the request of a poster.

So our story begins years ago, and the guy the client hired on to code. (Yes, I was a moron about pricing back then.) 

The Client, but eventually agreed to it. The project ended up taking three weeks of solid work to finish, but ended up turning out really nice. The site's monthly profit actually **went up by 650%** after the new design was launched. No, I'm not kidding, that's how much of an improvement I did. 

TJ, demanding extra free work done, and that we WILL do it because he's paying us so much. As I'm in the middle of trying to calm him down, and to explain that he got a VERY good deal on the project, he suddenly does a 180 personality change. He's suddenly extremely polite and nice, and says he completely understands. I'm a bit weirded out, but didn't think much of it. 

Well, calls me up, freaking out. His PayPal card was declined as he was trying to pay for his dinner that night. Considering we'd just gotten paid by TJ, to our Paypal accounts....this was odd. Both of us checked Paypal, and found out TJ had reversed the payments. 

Coder, and strips down all the files, and leaves up a note on the website of “TJ tried to scam his designer and the coder, and this is what he got”. Not a  classy move, but within two minutes, TJ was calling me up, screaming with rage. He made all sorts of insane rants, that we scammed him

I explain, the files will be removed, until receipt of the payment. He rants a bit more about how this is “illegal extortion”, but finally gives back the money. Coder puts back the files, problem solved.

Right. 

I guess coder felt like this wasn't good enough. I had no idea, and posted the entire story of how TJ had just attempted to screw us over. Being as one of the main hubs that EVERYONE visited, word got out. Fast. I heard about the post within half an hour, and by the time I went to go check, TJ and coder were having it out on the forums, screaming at each other. 

I promptly got a call from someone purporting to be TJ's lawyer (later found out it was his friend), etc. I tell Coder to cut it out, and I get the forum thread locked down.

TJ Ims me and throw a huge amount of threats my way....he's gonna track me down and beat me up, magically, this would all blow over.  

A few weeks later, and he asked if my kids were nearby, as they typically are. Hm, weird, but I said yeah, of course, one's even sitting in my lap. TJ is all “kids are wonderful like that. So, so I got up, hardcore porn floods the screen. I'm horrified, I had the feeling he was gonna be causing problems.

This occurred a few more times over the next few months. I'd get messages from fake people

The final straw came when he went onto that same forum that Coder posted about him on. TJ went  and made a post about me, I stole my client's bank account numbers, SSNs, and their CC numbers. 

I'd had it, and I'd drag him through courts if I had to. TJ flipped out, claimed this is all MY fault. I cut him off, say I'm serious, and I'm done. I'm blocking TJ again, and if I hear ONE WORD, I'm going to the police.

That was the last I heard of him for a while

I later ran into his ex-partner, he and TJ had sold the website after it became hugely popular, and the partner realized afterwards that something seemed a bit funny. He contacted the buyer, and asked to see the records TJ had sent them after the sale. He was shocked to discover TJ had falsified their financial records after the profits skyrocketed. He's siphoned off something like $10,000 of his partner's money, and kept it for himself.

That wasn't all though, someone withdrawing small amounts. (this website is where you earn money by doing small tasks)  He made an offhand comment on how that person must be doing very well, and the new owner was like “yeah, come to think of it....they're been withdrawing every day...”. New owner checks the account, and HOLY MACKEREL, they have a $5,000 pending balance! That's literally impossible to pull off....especially considering that the account was created **the day before the site sold**. Upon further digging, all created the day before the sale

And all with payment details that belong to TJ.

Yep,000, if he'd not been caught. So yeah, ex-partner and new owner were furious, and trying to find TJ. I just said I'm sorry, can't help you there, and went back about my business. 

Tthe next week, ranting about the same thing.

TJ.

He'd had a second business whose business model was paying people to run advertisements he was being paid for. But, and were in the process of setting up lawsuits.

Another year passes, and he suddenly blurts “Well, nothing tops this one guy, TJ.”

TJ apparently tried to scam a couple of people with the payment reversal trick. One of which was my new client. Neither would have any of it, and called the police in BOTH towns at about 2-3 am. 

He informed the police that the person he was calling about was waving about a shotgun

You can imagine the response that happened to that.

First guy was woken up at 3 am by the police bashing down his door and dragging him outside and laying him on the pavement. He was surrounded by about five cars

Second guy wasn't actually home, so they were woken up in the middle of the night by policemen bashing down the door and getting them out.

Everything got straightened out of course

The icing on the cake was that TJ contacted my client afterwards and ranted at him

New client then proceeded to show me some interesting links in an online arrest record.

In the year since I last told TJ that if he didn't cut it out

The first incident started out with him calling the police and claiming he'd been robbed of his TV and Xbox...only to have been found out that he was lying

Afterwards, and then domestic violence. 

His businesses all folded, from what I hear, they still managed to track him down.

However

Probably gonna be really difficult for him to do that

I am a junior analyst and because we are a smaller company I take care of day-to-day tech support as well. We dabble in marketing and data sales


Now for the story:
One day another junior analyst Derpina asked me if I could show her how to link her Excel charts and graphs into Powerpoint, so all she had to do was refresh all the links and voila, the whole PPT was done. I show her EXACTLY how to do it, step by step and she was extremely grateful.


Fast forward 2 months: Due to vacations we were a bit short-staffed and I had to do almost twice the work for 1 week during which time the I was pulling 10-11 hours each day to get it all done. We have a shared schedule in the office which basically prioritizes my work and Friday morning I only had 3 things left on it


At 11am a new task pops up: ""Derpina needs Report X by the end of today."" At this point


Me: *Hey Derpina

Derpina: *Well no

Me: *Heh

Derpina: *I tried that

Me: *That's wierd. Did you rename the excel file perhaps? But even if you did

Derpina: *Which excel file?*

Me: *The one that has the graphs for the report.*

Derpina: *Oh

Me: *The powerpoint has links to the graphs in excel Derpina... You need the excel with the graphs for the Powerpoint to work.*

Derpina: *Well that's stupid! Why did you bother in the first place then?*

Me: *So you wouldn't have to copy-paste it everytime! I'm sorry but now you have to re-do all the graphs.*

Derpina: *No way


Thankfully our boss knows how linking works and Derpina had to redo every graph and link them to Powerpoint herself.

As stated in a previous thread, instead of finding a supervisor or SME they could ask in Jabber. As one of the moderators (and someone who could type 100+wpm even back then) of the chatroom, I would respond with the answer.

Because of this we couldn't take calls

Out of nowhere in my second month

Not going to let myself get thrown for a loop

Me: ""Tech support

Customer: ""Yeah. My card isn't working.""

Me: ""I am very sorry that you are having trouble.  Could you give me the model number for your device so I can pull up the tools I need to fix the problem for you?""

Customer: ""Yeah...it's the IM241 card."" 

At this point I am googling the number and find out that this is apparently some extremely archaic

Me: ""Okay

Customer: ""Well I keep connecting but the red light won't come on.""

Me: ""And the red light is supposed to come on?""

Customer: ""OF COURSE!  You act like you've never heard of my device before or something!""

Me: (laughing) ""No worries there

I put the customer on hold

I told my supervisor I'd just gotten a call for some project I'd never heard of.

Supervisor: ""Oh yeah

Turns out apparently my building volunteered to take over calls for this extremely outdated card that almost nobody still owned, ever successfully helped a customer with their PC card--we would basically just take the calls and send them to wherever we thought was best.  Eventually the customer would either give up and cancel their card, or figure it out on their own.  I kinda think this was the goal--it isn't cost effective to have people take calls for a device that only a few dozen people in the US probably still used.

Me: ""Okay

Supervisor: ""Oh yeah

Stunned

The next half hour was hell, re-inserting the card and SIM card...basically anything I could think of that may go wrong to a PCMCIA card in a laptop).

In the end, I have no idea how to help him either...but honestly nobody does.  Send him over and I'll see what we can do.""

I'll still never know what happened to the poor guy with the dinosaur PC card.  But the next time someone tells me ""Here,"" I'm calling BS.

1348831991.0,10m43d,csv: computer stupidity verified,billryethedrunkenguy,795,134,145,"I sat behind the IT help desk in my university's library one semester during my undergrad in order to generate beer money while studying.  It only lasted one year before we were replaced by the Information Kiosk

There were literally only two things I did:

1) Re-enact the step by step instructional posters located beside the coin operated photo copier. 

2) Read out the bright red message located beside the email login form (and emailed to the old accounts) telling students their password had been reset to their student number for the new mail server over the summer.

This story though has to do with a graduate student who showed up a month or two before the end of the fall semester to occasionally work in a quasi office space located behind me.  Sheila, as a returning student, notified of the change to your password.""

Now our school, and responses were typed directly into the body of a reply email to be sent on their merry way......  Now I'm not sure who came up with that clever plan, but whichever poor soul's inbox that load of garbage got dumped into somehow managed to parse and extract the relevant data and pass it onto Sheila.  Enter Sheila.

Now Sheila was one of those girls who thought she knew everything.  Strike that - she knew she knew everything.  Not only about current events and politics which no red blooded American would be caught dead not having the correct opinion on, and the history of humankind as a whole...also computers.  Needless to say I was happiest when she was hunched over her keyboard one handed typing away than anything else.

A few weeks passed, and she began talking less and less.  One day while sitting at the desk with my phone on vibrate, I answered a call from my friend with an innocent ""How's it going?""  Cue Sheila sitting behind me.

Sheila: ""Humph! This is so stupid is how it's going!""

Me: Silently mouth ""sorry"" to her while gesturing to my phone.

Sheila: *Grumble Grumble*

-phone call eventually must end-

Sheila: ""*How*...Am *I*...Supposed to get *this*... *done*!""

Me (with much reservation): ""Is there anything I can help you with?""

Sheila: ""NO!""

Me: slowly turning away as not to attract any atten...

Sheila: ""Just look at this! They didn't give me enough time to enter all this info!""

I pause for a moment and take time to digest what has been said.  enter the info..enter the info..enter the info.  Just what is going on here.  She was always talking about 'implementation achievements'

Me: ""Are you having trouble generating fancy 3d graphs and colorful charts?""

Sheila (whining): ""I haven't even gotten to that yet.  I'm still placing all the info in.""

Me (suspicious): ""I thought you said someone sent you all the info and you were analyzing it?""

Sheila (haughtily): ""Yes but to do that I have to put it all in don't I!""

Me: ""Well what format is it in?""

Sheila: *blankface*

Me: ""What type of file did it come in?""

Sheila: *blankface*

Me: ""What did the file extension say?""

Sheila: *blankface*

Me: ""What are the letters after the period in the file name you received?""

Sheila: *blankface*

Me: ""Ummm...what program are you putting it into?""

Sheila: ""Excel obviously!""

*The color drains from my face as I slowly rise from my seat and walk over to her computer.*

Open on her monitor are two windows.  One

Me: turning to look at her ""Are you typing in every singl...""

Sheila: ""I know!  I'm not stupid.  I tried to copy paste it in but it kept on going in wrong.""

Reaching over I silently commandeer the mouse from her right hand (the same hand she one hand types with), ""open with...Excel""

I ask her if any other keys are not working.  She says she doesn't think so.  I hit the windows key to open the start menu so I can test out the shift key.  Nothing happens.

""Looks like your Windows key is broken too.""

""The what key?"" she asks.

""And your ctrl key...and your alt key...""

Turns out the entire bottom left corner of the keyboard doesn't work.  I didn't really think  much about it

Two of those computers were used by people doing actual work, I put a request for two network cards, and a crossover network cable (a router would never have been allowed as an expense). In order to make sure they understood I needed a crossover cable, I wrote in the paper, ""for direct connection between two computers"".

A couple of weeks later

That, and Windows would transfer data between both. Most certainly not a network cable.

Now, I had a lot of pressure on me to make things work with whatever I had, or they'd find someone else to do it.

So... soldering iron in hand, I took a picture to forever remind me of that moment. I still have it, and I will share it with you: http://i.imgur.com/LPb0u.jpg

**Previous Chapters:**

[Chapter 1 - My first job in IT](http://redd.it/xtlhx) 

[Chapter 2 - Store uniforms](http://redd.it/xyazr)

* * *

I was happy to finally have a decent uniform to wear. I had been walking around in questionable clothing for far too long. My new shirt was light pink and had the store logo across it. The only downside was the new name badge that came with it: I don’t like the idea of strangers calling me by my name and pretending they are on a first name basis with me. 

The name badge was part of the second wave of the plans from Ron and Don to revamp the store. In a second store meeting

After about six weeks of planning, they were done with the  makeover.The result was what looked like an counterfeit back-alley Apple Store. The store windows now were completely free of the promotional posters that had been up there for too long. The glass was  tainted with adhesives for weeks afterwards. The tables were put in the center of the store and had refurbished notebooks on them. The desktops were banished to the right side of the store with the software and accessories on the left. New was the table full of iPod knock-offs that would be the new, “can I interest you in…” item. 

The store still kept many of its old features. The walls were still brownish (they used to be white a long time ago) and the floor was old grey carpeting that had had its time. The bins containing all kinds of USB-gadgets and promotional displays still were scattered around the store. 

On the outside they did nothing; the paint was still chipping off and the street was still dirty. The store sign had changed by now

With the store now having a full fledged identity crisis, but I was happy, since it beat working in the store.

The back was messy and looked old. The walls were hidden behind rows and rows of metal bookcases storing inventory

The part of the walls that were free of the bookcases were used for storing boxes. The only thing that looked remotely new in this place was the light above the safety exit hanging next to the door. They had it replaced before I came to work here under pressure from the fire department. Otherwise it would have have been an archaeologically perfectly preserved 80’s IT-workspace.

In the middle of the room we had the work benches. 2 big grey tables with another on top. On top bench we had all the PCs and notebooks we had to work on with their information sheet taped on the front. Aside from the ungrounded extension cords it was actually a decent workplace. 

Not knowing where to start with cleaning the mess up

I then took out the next box and started looking through it: mostly old video and sound cards. I was ready to put it back and slap an “Audio/Video” label on it when something caught my eye. I took it out and I could not for the life of me identify it at first. It was an tennis ball covered with screws, why we even had it. Asking Richard a couple days later, he told me they had played a match of “pain ball.” Pain ball was a game they had played to see who could handle more pain. He showed me all the damage they had done to the store with it; broken LCD screens - carefully hidden behind boxes - and damaged walls.

It is about now that I should tell you more about Frank and Richard. They were - to put it kindly - practical jokers. They had a spirit of having fun around them and whenever an opportunity arose, costs, or ethics involved. They treated everybody equally. Them buying me an outfit was an opportunity to play a joke on me, made possible by Don and Ron.

Their other hobby was doing imitations of _Jackass_ and building things. Strange things. When I had put the pain ball away and went on with cleaning up the store

Hidden between the CD and DVD drives, would eject a knife. The Shooter was a collection of high RPM fans that been taped together.With part of their casing removed, it worked like a waterwheel, shooting away pieces of cereal. What took the cake for me was the walking video card. They had taken an old card and put 4 fans on it, their casings removed. Being hooked up to a small battery it would sort of walk. It was surreal to see, if totally pointless.

Having cleaned out most of the back, just to look at what was the “must buy” hardware at the time. Computers were expensive back then. I had gone through about three quarters of the pile when something came up that was not a PC-magazine. It was a porn magazine, vintage 1997. 

It was unexpected, and I still felt dirty. I decided it was better to just leave it. It was either from Ron or Don, and I did not want to know which.

Later that week

What was missing, and, reaching under the desk, I determined that it was attached as it should be. There was a lot of dust, though. Already on the verge of sneezing my eyeballs out from all the dust, I managed to open the side of the computer up. It seemed to be working on dust: everything was grey aside from the video card, which was, I found that it was indeed Cheetos dust and smudges covering the entire card. The heat sink had been removed and replaced by Cheetos. Unsurprisingly

Two or three computers without advanced Cheetos cooling down the road

""This is ridiculous


""I am not allowed to help you unless you have a Derp support warranty sir. I'm sorry


""Yeah


At this point I could tell he knew he was defeated. His once booming voice had become small &amp; weak. He then asked how much it would cost to extend his warranty. I told him I'd have to transfer him to another department for that, without arguing, how much it would cost to have us clean up the virus. I transferred him to our fee-based support department, but I'm not sure what they could do about it since he couldn't even get into his system to initiate a remote session. But meh, not my problem.


What a mook. I don't know if he was trying to pull one over on me or was just genuinely too stupid to recognize over $200 worth of support charges on his credit card


I will never understand what makes a grown adult think that throwing tantrums like a 2 year old is ever even remotely OK ಠ_ಠ

I am on the phone to $nice_guy_older_field_tech. I have a long history with $NGOFT
One of the issues that I had identified with the install was that the servers had been installed into an unlocked disused basement room with little airflow and no power backups. The server towers were plopped under a desk with loose cabling leading to a switch sitting exposed on the desk. Their first major outage was due to a power loss that caused drive corruption.
$NGOFT responded by building the room into a real computer space with actual server server racks
The UPS was installed at the bottom of the rack
The customer was duly impressed with his display of competence. 

Which brings me to my real story. 
We were doing a significant patch install. This required stopping the redundancy services to apply the patch to the common application drive. We were doing this at 10pm
We had just restarted the mirror process

The swearing got worse when $NGOFT got the rack started up again and found that both drive arrays were corrupted. Thankfully he had done backups

**The Guy in the Tie**  
So you all know from [the last story](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/r58tc/how_i_turned_a_demotion_into_giving_me_power_over/) that the office manager had bumped me out of the office tech position without actually thinking about the resulting side effects. When he realized that, and that almost 90 people had suddenly discovered that their [magic fix-everything icon](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/qrqsa/ten_minutes_a_day/) suddenly wasn't working any more, he immediately leapt into uninformed action.

His first attempt at replacing me was to determine who else in the office had computer knowledge sufficient to address all the common issues. The answer, technically-minded and hyper-competent staff member on the roster.

What he didn't know was that she was my girlfriend.
   
  
   
His overtures, she could have done the job - but she was pissed off at his treatment of me, and told him in no uncertain terms where he could stick his excuse for a management style.

Some weeks later, if that, and he had no more computer knowledge than the manager. However, as the position was technically 'filled', the manager didn't have to listen to staff complaining about the busted computers any more, or why he wasn't allowing me to fix them.

The replacement's sole talent, which was more than the rest of the non-management staff bothered with. This earned him the moniker of the Guy in the Tie, which I can remember even now despite his actual name being lost to the mists of time.

The Guy in the Tie was helpful, and absolutely useless at technical diagnoses. Given that amount of free time I had, I even made it worse on occasion by trailing him around the office, sticking my feet up on a desk while he labored fruitlessly over some piece of equipment for half an hour, and when he left stepping over and repairing it in thirty seconds. It got to the point where whenever he turned up, any staff in the vicinity would give him a look which said ""Go away so the grinning guy behind you can provide the help you obviously can't.""

It probably didn't do much for either his concentration *or* his reputation. Heh. And of course
   
  
   
Fortunately
   
  
   
But that's a story for another time.

1350947197.0,11wp9i,Passwords. Tricky business.,pcbeats,808,161,217,"I work for a small IT contracting company that currently has me
stationed at a Catholic high school. Recently we have had the pleasure
of acquiring a new teacher with the ethereal voice of a buzz saw
irreparably damaged hair from 60 years of chemically treated self
esteem issues and such very
help desk requesting that I set her up in the active directory and exchange server and
give her a quick run down of how things work around here. I assign her
a password, etc. Seems like a
nice enough lady.


About a week goes by when I receive an email from her:

""HEY SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME MY EMAIL DOES NOT WORK.""

Oh no? Begrudgingly I go to her room to pay her a visit. Turns out she
just assumed it wasn't working because she wasn't getting responses
from other faculty members about an email that didn't warrant a
response. I start to humor the possibility that this lady is going to
start becoming a very frustrating part of my work day.


A few days later there's a knock on my office door. It's you know who:

""Hey can you help me my password does not work.""

""Doesn't work? That's unusual.""

""It doesn't work!""

""Ok


It works. Oh her password works alright. What DOESN'T work is the
random new password she just decided she wanted to start using.


""Where did you get this from? This is not your password""

""I called someone and they said it was my password""

""What? Who did you call?""

""Diane.""

""Diane who?""

""Diane ______""

""Who's that?""

""My friend.""


The person she called does not work at our school
affiliation with us whatsoever. She called her friend. And her friend
just told her a password. Any password.


""Have you tried using the password I assigned to you that has worked
for the past week?

""No""

""Ok then
provided you with on day 1 and please do not stray from that log in information.""


Another few days pass by when there is a loud pound on the door. It startles me as i quickly sit upright and choke on my coffee. What the hell was that? I get up to go see
what the noise is all about and as I approach the office door to grab
the handle i'm greeted with a repeated
piston in a getaway driver's car. I take a deep
open the door.


""Oh good morning _____

""HELP MY PASSWORD ISN'T WORKING!""

""You didn't start using a new password did you?""

""NO! PLEASE HELP!""


Class is in session and teachers are all looking out their doors to
see what the noise is all about. They see their new coworker
flailing
already established herself as a less than desirable individual to
interact with. I catch a couple of them chuckle and point at me that already know how much I love talking to this woman.

I go back to her room with her to have her show me the problem. She
sits down to type her password and reveals the issue to me:


""So everything was fine but I don't know how to capitalize the dollar
sign in my password and it always worked before but now it doesn't.""

""Wait

""No

""That's because no one can. You do not need to capitalize the dollar sign. Just enter it.""

""Well how do I enter a lower case dollar sign without making all the letters lower case?""


That's where I began to explain to her how to use a keyboard. The
first time I have ever actually had to explain
use a keyboard. I typed up simple
them out and left them on her desk. Haven't heard from her since and
I don't know if that's a good or bad thing. Someone may have forgotten to explain to her how to breathe.



**TL;DR**: Crazy lady randomly uses different password. Can't log in because she's making all sorts of attempts to capitalize the dollar sign in her password.

So I have him open his wireless network list and point out that he is connected to the new network that I set up. What's more, I don't even SEE the old network on the list. He begins ranting that he swears he had it working and he will fix it shortly. So I walk out to check the airport itself.

1331950754.0,r0axt,Mission Critical server in service for 2 years with no working hard drives,mod_critical,804,162,218,"There seems to be a recurring theme in corporate I.T. that for any given server

Once upon a time there was a large national corporation in the financial business. As this company grew, telephony slowly became part of I.T. Phones were just IP connected devices, phone lines became SIP trunks, and PBXs became just another server in the rack. Well, everywhere except for at _this_ corporation. There, the telephony team made a special point to control their telephony hardware, even though they were just servers very much the same as any other in the data center.

Shortly after I was hired there I got an alert that a server had a failed hard drive in a mirrored set. ""No Problem!"" I think

WRONG.

First I find the server, and no hot swap hard drive bays. Wow, okay, I guess I'll have to schedule an outage to replace that IDE drive.

WRONG.

This particular server was one of the telephony team's server. I had never seen one of these telephony people, this server could not be down, not for 1 second, ever.

""But that other hard disk will go eventually, the other hard drive failed. However, the system did not crash! You see, the application never performed disk I/O, so it never hung waiting for the drives that were long gone. You couldn't log in to the server, as an audit record couldn't be written to the log. You couldn't do anything to the server really. BUT, the application kept dutifully providing synthesized voice to thousands of callers a day despite all this.

""It's fate is sealed now, did not seem to concern them, as everything was ""working"".

Eventually I forgot about the server. Months went by, old hardware was removed, hundreds of millions of dollars were spent.

Then I heard about the fact that the whole data center was going to have to power down for a weekend! Something to do with the electric coming into the building

""Well I wonder what ever happened to that server with no hard drives

I talked at length with the telephony team. They were furious, nobody had bothered to prepare for it going down in any way.

It was like watching a hurricane; everything was going to get fucked up but there wasn't anything anybody could do about it. Eventually the day came for the power outage. It was over thanksgiving weekend

I made sure to pull the plug on that one myself.

The next three weeks were wonderful. All the fallout of a full power off of the data center, missed reports, etc., was all drowned out by the impact of the telephony team needing to rebuild the text-to-speech system from scratch.

I stayed with Sarah for most of the Sunday before I left her in the care of her family again. I didn’t go home straight away but went by Jeremy. I had not spoken with him since the night before. He was rather surprised when I showed up at his door

I went to school while Jeremy went to the store. Both of us were dreading it

He told me Ron and Don had been informed by him about everything that happened. Ron’s heart went out more to the notebook than to Sarah. “Was it really necessary? Was the only question he asked that sounded genuine. Don quickly intervened though “Don’t be like that. I’ll call the girl the see if she’s ok”. He did actually follow up on it and called Sarah.

My next shift was a Friday again and well

I had been pushing Jeremy for months to go back to school and supported him in every step he had taken towards that goal. It didn’t feel right to not support him now when he actually had made the decision and the paperwork was filled in already. We had compromised that my shifts would be with him. It was only three months. I could handle it. It wasn’t Ron &amp; Don’s fault that this happened? Was it?

When stepping in the store again after a week of absence it felt strange and uncomfortable.  I put my jacket and bag in the back and changed quickly in the store clothing. The shift would only take about four hours. Jeremy quickly noticed my unease and offered to take care of the store while I would fix the computers in the back. I gladly took his offer as it was something he seldom did. He felt guilty about making me stay.

The next Saturday was a full day and things started taking their usual rhythm again. I was surprised about how quickly I picked it all up again. I had been in the store for most of the day until we switched places. I went to the back and started working on the computers for about 20 to 40 minutes before I walked to the cage holding the computer that stored the security footage and UPS. It was a quality cage

I asked Jeremy if he knew the code on the cage but he didn’t. Ron didn’t share it with anyone; not even Don knew. I asked Ron if I could see the footage but he told me it was already deleted by now. I knew it wasn’t true. He had boasted to the police agents who had come to collect the video evidence of Alex that he kept 6 months worth of footage. He never lied about stuff like that.

Ron and Don had the meantime had become silent again and started withdrawing from the store again. They would hire new personnel in the coming weeks. “You better do because the both of us are leaving as soon as we can

It wasn’t until three weeks later that I realised there were still other people that could know the codes; Frank &amp; Richard. I still had their phone numbers and called them. I tried Richard first. He didn’t pick up; I got a computer voice telling me it was a disconnected phone line. I tried Frank. The phone rang, three times; it went to Voicemail. I ended the call and threw my phone on the desk and smashed my head on my desk. I stayed like that for a couple of minutes.

The desk started vibrating. The phone was ringing. It was Frank calling back. He was doing well and was very talkative. I told him my story. He was silent. Despite the fact that Frank &amp; Richard could do questionable things

With the code in my hand I went to the office of Don and opened the cabinet. I had left the lights off on purpose
The papers were mostly manuals

It took me a while before I understood how the software worked and where the footage was located. When I found it I watched it again and again. It didn’t make things easier for me as I had hoped. The footage was hard to watch. It was only one minute and twenty-six seconds worth of footage. Was that all it took to destroy someone’s sense of security?

I closed the window and started looking around on the computer some more. It only had the security video software installed on the system. What caught my eye was the fact that there was a shortcut for remote desktop on the desktop. I clicked it and it opened with the last used address. It connected. It was a Windows Server 2003 and it was asking me for credentials.

I was having a moral problem now. I had seen what I had come for. Would it be ok for me to also log in on this remote server? I decided to try on log in. It was hard for me to find the credentials and after trying the 12th set I decided to give up. I went through the stack of papers again when I noticed random letters written on the edges of a page. I tried that as password. I was in.

I started looking around the server but it looked clean to me. No out of the ordinary software installed or strange files on the desktop. I wasn’t familiar with the server editions of windows and went through the list of server specific applications. DHCP

I was ready to close the cage when my eye fell on the UPS again. Why does he keep that around? It doesn’t even work. And locked in the cage? I took a closer look and leaned over. I lost my balance and landed on the UPS with my body. The unit shifted. I saw it had a network cable attached to it. I pulled the UPS out of the cage

Once out I tried to look in to the openings in the casing but didn’t see much. I put my ear to it. I heard the rattling of hard disks. This wasn’t a UPS anymore. It was a computer. I put the UPS back in again and reconnected to the server. Something wasn’t right here. I wanted to find out. If they were doing something illegal I wanted to know.

I started looking through the computer again. While going through every program down the list. It was then and there that I saw it! This could be the key to understanding this strange setup.",,t5_2sfg5,1354922303.0,,tftsflair,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/14fuy7/chapter_15_when_things_fall_apart_pt_1/

*Names and events have been changed to protect the innocent. And to appear more awesome.*

**Act I: In Which the Battle Lines are Drawn**

Let us not underestimate the love a man feels for his customers. Especially the ones who give him money and don't complain. To have a customer wrestled from his hands by the likes of those Scoundrels! Wastrels! Ragamuffins! Rogues!

It is unfortunate that the man at Worst Purchase who had wronged me so was likely only attempting to do that which was necessary as per the requirements of his no doubt monstrous suit-clad overlords. Yet such is war. Two men may meet on a battlefield

I had endeavored to let it go. I was to allow this infraction from a man I did not know, a series of unfortunate events instilled in me the need to take immediate action.

Over the course of the next few months, all tied together by the simple utterance of two small words. *Nerd Patrol*.

Those two words made my skin crawl. Was I upset for having to handle their incompetence? Was I disappointed that people in my industry could fail so completely in their responsibilities? Or was I merely jealous that they were

**Act II: In Which Straw is Piled on a Camel**

The first of these affronts to the technically competent was a customer who came into my store with her brand new laptop. She was unable to access windows. I began my much beloved bench diagnostics. The system booted to it's login. The login name was ""Worst Purchase"". Passworded. Summoning all my available resources and knowledge, not only had these hooligans provided a passworded, unusable laptop to my customer, but had also charged her for an ""initial PC setup"". I informed her that she was to return to the Nerd Patrol as my agent of vengeance, and demand a refund for obviously not doing the job that was paid for. I did a system wipe and reinstalled windows.

The second of these infractions was a customer with a custom made computer. This computer had exactly nothing in it. A mid-range processor, low end video card, and two DIMM's, at 2gig each. That was not the surprising thing. What was surprising was that it also had a basic water-cooling system that only covered the processor, ran to a radiator, and back to the processor. Aside from the insignificant airflow coming off the pump, *there were no fans anywhere in this case*. So was it any surprise that his computer was overheating? ""Who did this to you!"" I demanded

Apparently his machine sat in his bedroom, was to remove all the fans and install this water ""cooling"" system. To make matters worse, the radiator was caked in dust, and the fluid was over 6 months old. No information had been given to him on the maintenance of this particular cooling system. I demanded a name, but he could not remember it, no doubt due to the shock of finding out his $300's of work was in vain. I installed two low-decibel fans, one on the side blowing onto the motherboard

As bad as both of those were

She had arrived with a computer that would not connect to the internet. Leery that it had worked fine before she took it to THE STORE OF LIES and not when she got it back, and after inquiring about it, I received the above quote. This will not stand! I confirmed that not only had she paid for both pieces of software, but she had also paid to have the Nerd Patrol *actually install it for her* at the insistence of the sales rep. I had her sit around as I uninstalled both programs, ran the removal tool for both, and installed a free anti-virus for her. I felt sorry that she had purchased expensive software and the subscription for both of them. I didn't charge her, gave her my card

It was on.

**Act III: Excuse me

I developed a plan. A cunning

I was tasked with picking up a new HDD from Worst Purchase for a rush job with a corporate client. Armed with a friendly smile, I saw a woman carrying out a laptop, displaying the infernal brand of the Nerd Patrol. I stopped her, merely handed her my card, and wished her well. I would see this woman later, but that is a story for another time. I took a deep breath, and crossed the threshold into the very heart of villainy. I made for the service counter

""Sir

""Um... hold on sir. Let me speak to one of my technicians""

I heard them planning their nefarious scheme behind closed doors. The technician was close to clock-out, and I kept hearing him say ""Are you sure he didn't say sATA? This idiot doesn't know what he's talking about."" I allowed my smile to fade. The technician finally came to the front. His name tag reads ""Techdouche"", and he is likely ten years my senior.

""Hi

""Yes

""I'm not familiar with that.""

""... ... ... a ribbon cable.""

""Oh. Um, and me informing him that I'm not interested, I just need a replacement HDD, he finally pulls one off the shelf. ""I think this is... a ribbon cable,"" he says, turning the product over in his hands. I clearly see the box marked as sATA. I also take note that it's the largest, most expensive HDD they have on the shelf. This repeats twice more, and ask the killer question

**Act IV: A Villain Defeated!**

Techdouche's eyes glaze over, I was a fool for this was only his first form. A change overtakes him. A fire burns in his previously glassy, soulless eyes. He fixates me in his gaze. ""Are you trying to make me look stupid?"" I must admit, I was slightly taken aback. I had not expected our game of cat and mouse to so quickly dissolve into a direct, armed confrontation.

But, not at all. You seem to be doing that just fine on your own."" Thus began his full on onslaught. Though he kept his voice low to avoid spooking the herd, he was able to instill the heated rage of ten thousand white hot suns into every word. In these situations I tend to tune people out, allowing them to fall upon their own sword of vitriol and ignorance. This man had gone to college! He had been working with computers for over *five* years! He had worked in the IT department of *three* major corporations! I was just some punk kid who didn't know the ass end of a USB port!

People had taken note. The citizens were becoming restless. Eyes watched cautiously from around lines of overpriced electronics. Then

""Sir

The man stepped back in stunned silence. A number of people had gathered around, from my vanquished foe. My path to the register took me by the service desk, where a customer was sitting, awestruck. I handed her a generic business card, and suggested she might want to give that place a try. She nodded quietly. I purchased my HDD, and returned to my store.

The war was far from over. I made no attempt to get the man fired

But this battle had been won

Now read on...

   
  
   
So I had time, unsecured macro language. I was also bored, and looking for things which could be improved. So I build...  

...a macro which ran through all the government benefit-issuing and -reviewing interviews which were scheduled to be performed at the office in the upcoming week, and even then only by the interviewer, so they could find themselves with a very patchy workday instead of the neat set of interviews they'd been expecting to use as an excuse to pass off their back-office paperwork to someone else.

Only around 70% of interviewees actually turned up to their original times, members of the public who actually *wanted* interviews in order to get their government entitlements before they starved to death were being booked in timeslots weeks away.

I solved this by having the macro identify all the spare timeslots in advance, or even today. All of a sudden, the time blowout on interviews is cut by a third, interview days are more predictable, and interviewees are happier because they've been 'fast-tracked'. Stress drops, stats soar. I write up the process, pass it off to the section booking the interviews

   
  
   
...a macro which speeds up the data entry of manually issued benefit checks. Previously, compared it to the relevant records on the system, and then entered it automatically. Check rejection by the audit systems dropped to 2% overnight, and I no longer had to spend hours every day slowly moving through the same workflow over and over. Which meant I had time to build...

   
  
   
...a set of simple forms I could print out and attach to physical files which had been sent to us accidentally. Such things were a problem, and got attached to the front of the files which were sent right back to where they came from (or where they were supposed to be).  

I combined this with a program which scoured the 60, and where it actually *was*. This led to me purging the file stacks of an awful lot of files which we shouldn't have had at our site, thus making it easier for the rest of the staff to find something in the archives when they had to go hunting. I also used the opportunity to re-alphabetize the archives properly - no-one had done that in twenty years, and it gave me something to do when I didn't want to be sitting at a desk staring off into space. And when I got bored with *that*, I sat down and proceeded to build...

   
  
   
...a game of Arkanoid on the mainframe, I'd automated everything *else.*  

Now, or faster, or cheaper, and they'd enter it in a publicly accessible database, pass the idea on to whichever manager or executive was the lowest level with the authority to approve it, and theoretically update the database eventually with a Yea/Nay/Maybe as to whether it had been implemented.

I had a lot of free time, and I soon hatched a devious plan which would take me all the way to the CEO's office...

   
  
   
...but that's a story for another time.

I had a customer call me and ask for his password to be reset. I asked him what the problem was since this is kind of an odd request. He said that he could not get his email and he needed his password reset. I asked him if he had changed his password and forgot it. He said ""No"" but that this happened quite a bit. I looked at the previous calls and he had indeed called to have his password changed quite a few times and the previous tech had made the change and just ended the call. I told him that passwords do not just change on their own and asked him to try to pull a web page. He couldn't and I told him that his password was not his problem

The next bit of the call went as follows:

&gt;Cust: ""I have told you enough to do your job

&gt;Me: ""Why yes sir. Just one second"" I change password ""Ok, '**r**', '**k**' all lower case. Please type that in for me and lets see if you can get your email. I'll stay on the line. Do you need me to spell it again?""

Me: Okay the only images I see are the banner and the backgrounds of the menu and those are loading for me.

Cust: Okay you see where the drop down menu is? One you select and option an image should load.

*I look at the site a bit more and figure out this is an ID creator where you select the type of Id you want to make

Cust: I am the developer.

A customer came in store with their printer as they said they couldn't get it to work. Lets call him Barry.

**Me** - Hi I'm Limitr. What can I do for you today mate?

**Barry** - Hello my printer isn't working. I tell my computer to print but nothing comes out.

**Me** - No dramas at all can you just set it down on the counter and I'll hook it up and take a look.

Customer puts the printer down and I plug it in and fire it up. While it's going through it's short start up procedure I run through in my head what it could be.

**Me** - So did the printer display any error messages when it wouldn't print?

**Barry** - I'm not sure. It just doesn't print.

**Me** - Okie dokie then. Normally if something isn't right on a printer it'll give you some information on how best to fix it.

By now the printer has finished powering up and has displayed a message stating that it has a paper jam.

**Me** - Righteo so it's saying it's got a paper jam. If it's got a paper jam it won't print until you remove the jam. I'll sort that for you right now.

I turn the printer around and open up the rear hatch and find half an A4 page stuck in there. I quickly remove it and close the hatch.

The printer then moves the print head around and runs the rollers preparing to go back to it's ready state.

I tell the printer to print out a status report which is does so without an issue.

**Me** - There you go sir. Just a simple paper jam. Nothing too serious.

**Barry** - ...

I then go about unplugging the printer again so that the customer can be on his way.

**Barry** - Limitr where is your Boss. I'd like to speak to him.

I'm a little worried why the customer want's to speak to the Boss (I'd only been working at this place about a month by this point)

**Limitr** - Just a minute sir I'll go and get him for you.

I go and find the Boss and get him to come back to the Service Counter to see the customer.

**Barry** - I just wanted to speak to you quickly about Limitr's service. It was fantastic. He had my issue sorted out very quickly and was very helpful.

**Boss** - That's great!

**Me** - Thankyou very much Sir. That really means a lot to me.

I was cheering when the customer commended me to my Boss. Especially since I had only been there a short time.

I actually saw Barry again about a month later. Again the printer wasn't working. Turns out it was just out of Toner that time. Again Barry asks to speak to my Boss and commends me for sorting it out so quickly.

I returned to my store with the device cradled in my arms like a newborn child and hand it off to KungFu Manager. ""Many Bothans died to bring you this HDD.""

My manager turned to face me. ""PolloMagnifico... come sit down.""

My heart leapt into my throat. As I have mentioned before, and I was still his employee. We had an unspoken agreement that, when it was necessary, we would shift back into that relationship, deal with the official business that needed to be dealt with, and shift right back into our friendship with no hurt feelings. I had been ""spoken to"" on several different occasions at the behest of the company owner. It always started out with him asking me to come sit down. This would not be good.

""So

So far so good.

""And he said that if you're going to get a raise

Wait... what?

""So tomorrow

This... this is finally happening!

**Act II: FBI's most wanted**

Business slowly began to improve. The store (which was being funded by the parent company) was on the verge of turning a profit for the first time. Many of the new customers were former NerdPatrol customers, and a crash course on the network topography for the three DreamKiller offices. I was officially doing helpdesk! And it... was boring.

While yes, I was not given enough access to the important things. Things like the PBX server. Or the inventory. Or the firewall. Or really anything except active directory and exchange. So my abilities were basically limited to password resets, account creation, and escalation. Doesn't matter, had tech!

Enter the rich kid. His parent's were doctors. He was probably 18 or 19, lanky, pizza faced. He puts his ""very expensive"" custom made computer up on the desk and tells me he's got a problem. This is the story according to him.

He was spending his day doing the normal manchild computer thing, demanding he pay a fine within 48 hours or they would come knocking on his door. Remember this particular story, it's relevant for the entirety of the rest of this recollection.

I inform the kid that no, and confirm that the kid does in fact have a virus claiming to be an FBI virus and demanding he pay a fine of *$100*. The virus comes complete with an official FBI watermark, and even has a place ready to input the credit card number.

I tell the kid that I can get the virus off for our usual fee, and if he puts his credit card in there he's going to wind up with 98 additional problems (and a bitch still won't be one!).

Finally he relents and I remove the virus. When he comes back in the next day, and other general safety tips. But when I mention downloads, he dismissively says ""I never download anything"".

Dude. You have complete manga scans downloaded and saved in a file on your desktop. Don't BS me. But whatever. I send him on his way.

**Act III: Again dude? Really?**

Time clicks forward another month. I've settled into my role as helpdesk, we have a short discussion about some of the games I saw on his desktop that I had recently been working my way through as well. That leads to this gem.

""Hey

Now we're getting to the good part. Flash forward another half a month. Things are going quite well now

KungFu Manager Obliges. I sit outside the door and listen. The first thing the kid says is ""I think someone is hacking me.""

KungFu Manager stammers for a second

""I keep getting viruses even though I never download things. I think I'm being targeted by a hacker who keeps putting viruses on my computer!""

KungFu Manager calmly explains to him that it's not extremely likely that he's being targeted by a hacker, and viruses (again). KungFu Manager takes it in, we remove the viruses, and he goes over the firewall looking for open ports and a few other things (he's far better at security than I am) and can't find anything to indicate a problem. While we're doing this, I'm telling him about the previous two times the kid had been in, and how you would think someone who supposedly hacks well enough for the FBI to take notice would know how to keep his system secure. We decide to have a little fun with him.

We hold his computer for a little over a week. When he comes to pick up his system

*""We found some very interesting things on your computer. You had several open ports, and found an extremely sophisticated virus that had infected your BIOS, which is why the format didn't get rid of it. He traced it back to a known server exclusively utilized by the Chinese military for spying on American systems. He believes that you were originally a primary node in a chain of proxies used in a recent attack on the pentagon. Your computer was confiscated as evidence in an ongoing investigation into that particular attack, and he wanted us to thank you for being a good American Citizen.""*

Kid was absolutely devastated. He looked at us like he was about to cry and said ""Really?""

We place his computer on top of the counter.

""No

""... what's an IP address?""

I opened the case anyway and it looked like I had taken the top cover off of a honeybee hive

I know IMMEDIATELY that this PC is going in a BAG.  But I didn't have any bags.

I say ""Hey Carol (name changed)

I move the computer as carefully as I can without disturbing the residents within because I do NOT want them in my shop.  In retrospect I should have immediately taken it outside.  I make no claim to being extraordinarily bright.  Instead

I headed for the nearest WM to procure spray and bombs.  When I returned

Most of the next morning was spent in cleaning up the aftermath.  Then, with surprise results.  She says ""WOACHES?!?!?!  I DON'T HAVE WOACHES IN MY TWAILEW!!!  YOU MUST HAVE WOACHES IN HEWE AND THEY GOT IN MY COMPUTA FROM BEING IN HEWE"".  WTF?!?!?!?!  In defiance of that, I take the side panels off of two other desktops showing (surprisingly) an absence of infestation.  I tell her I can't/won't fix it because it's done.

She wants to know if I have another one I can sell her

The next day the phone rings.  It's her. ""THAT COMPUTA YOU SOLE ME STOPPED WUKING""

She brings it in and guess what?  The power supply is FULL of ~~WOACHES~~ ROACHES.

She denies it, take it outside on the sidewalk and SLAM it on the concrete.  When I remove it there are no less than a dozen of all sizes, some alive, some dead, some twitching.  She yells at me ""GIMME BACK MY COMPUTA IM GOING TO TAKE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TOO MANY WOACHES IN YOU PLACE"".  I comply, graciously.  Never heard from her or smelled her again.",,,,

I just recently (past few weeks) got a job at a small tech support place near where I go to school. It's not much

Okay. So this guy bought the computer from somebody. It's a custom-built machine with an Athlon tri-core and a GTX 280. It's pretty much a gaming machine. He says that he saw it boot at the guy's house, I noticed that it also had power plugged into both the SATA and Molex connections on the HDD, so somebody didn't quite know what they were doing along the line)

I say that I can take a look at it and get back to him after I run some diagnostics and such. He's perfectly okay with that, and take the computer. He seems kind of antsy and asks if he'll get an update that night. I say maybe, but it'll most likely be tomorrow, since we have a certain procedure for progressing through work.

I set it up and have one helluva time getting it to boot into a disc. First

After some clever work, and everything checks out just fine and dandy. I continue investigating.

So I finally get into the BIOS after googling the key to do so (seriously

I'm all like ""sweet!"" and send it right over to the call center, but he declines the work. My guess is that it would be too expensive. Per policy, I've gotta get it back to the state that it was in when the customer brought it in, since they didn't pay anything. So I just swap the boot order back to how it was before and *poof*, we're back to the cursor and no Windows. I put it out front to wait for a return appointment.

You'd think declining to pay anything would mean that nothing would be fixed.

You'd think that declining to have work done would mean that no work would be done.

Apparently not this guy.

He comes back in acting thankful and such as if we had actually fixed it. I make it crystal clear that I'm sorry he declined work and we didn't fix it. I never got close to saying anything like we had fixed it.

He just kinda says okay and stuff, and takes his. It says on the receipt that he declined work and no work was done.

And even though it's not what we're supposed to do, and he nods and says okay like he understands. He leaves.

But then he calls back. He's all in a tizzy because his computer has the same problem as before. He complains that we didn't fix it. 

[Wat?](http://i.imgur.com/9R0Ae.gif)

No shit sherlock. You didn't pay anything to fix it. You declined to have us fix it.

Now another appointment is scheduled tomorrow so I can tell him that we didn't fix it because he didn't want to pay to have us fix it. We'll see how that goes.

There is now an update - head over here to read it. [Infinite Backups Update!](http://redd.it/v1dqp)

This just happened in my company...

The big guys at the top finally decided to start doing backups. We have to keep records of transactions for two years - but for some reason, but we had no record if it now so had to just take the customer's word for it. This managed to scare the top enough that they let the IT guy finally put in a system solely for back up.

I don't know the details of it (not my department), but the server is not the only backup. It is the first level of backup. The data there is backed up offsite after a week. It is just a dedicated online,  onsite server storing the most recent daily backups.)
It was all working great for the past two months. We already run something to close the day

Anyway, and that he has (gasp) actually installed it a couple times. He knows he would do a much better job than the IT guy, but he is too ""important"" to waste his time on that. Luckily, the guys at the top don't let him mess with the IT stuff. (To give him credit, he is good at his actual job, so is not just an irritating waste of space.)

On Thursday

This should have ended there. His space was full. But no...
He goes to one of the bosses. Says he has some trouble with his network folder

E sets it up to make just backup wherever (to get around the space limit for individuals) and then sets it up so that the root of the backup server is one of his network drives. It is now included in his every-ten-minute backup list. He changes a bunch of other settings so that it ""works better"" and then goes on with his day.

At the end of the day

E had been backing up the backups, until the entire server was filled. E saw that there was no more space before everyone else - so what did he do? He set it up to just delete files based on date, starting with the oldest. Not just the backups - from anywhere on the server. He didn't have any trouble - closed his day, and then headed home (about half an hour early, for some reason.)

Nothing was actually lost in the end

We are still waiting to see what will happen to E. He has only come in to meet with the bosses and the IT guy. 

TL:DR - Server starts to make copies of itself

She then tried to start multiple worker processes for the software. The GUI would then connect to the worker process over the network - or the loopback interface in our case. Perfect for compute clusters. Anyways, but now I was about to lose my patience.

I ask if she has a wireless router through her home internet provider. She doesn't know. I ask how she uses internet at home

I ask if they are in an apt complex because there could possibly be a neighbor with an unlocked wifi signal. Nope. 

I am truly at a loss. Then I realize wee-fee. Wifi. She DOES have wifi.

Explained the smartphone connects to the wifi just like her laptop and can still use internet. 

I then hear chaos of cussing

Then she gets back on the phone and says she needs to file an insurance claim because she smashed the phone with a hammer. 

I explain intentional damage is not covered by insurance. 

More cussing. At this point I opt to use the ""if you use that language again I will disconnect call""

So there I was, the user's Single Sign-On isn't working with one website. Now, if you're not familiar, Single Sign-On is a program that tracks all of your login information whenever you sign into a website on your computer, and then it inputs it for you automatically every time after that so you don't have to type anything. It's like TiVo for lazy people, and it'd be great if not for two things:

People often forget their login info if they haven't typed it in since they got the computer

Well, and there's a nice workaround where we can just grab the login info from SSO and put it in manually. Quick, five-minute fix, tops.

So I remote in, and I have him input that for me. It comes back saying the PIN isn't correct, even though he typed it in right and is certain of it. Not wanting to second-guess his judgment, I figure it's an issue with SSO itself, and I run through the tedious process of fixing the program's checksum and renewing its GPO. Requires a reboot, takes longer than I'd like to admit.

Once we're back online, damnit! So I ask him:

&gt;""That *is* the right PIN for your smartcard

&gt;""Absolutely.""

Customer brings a Macbook Air to us to take a look at and see if we can recover the data off it.  It doesn't boot and Apple has told him it would be a $700 dollar logic board to fix.  So he's decided to buy a new one but would like all his stuff off the old computer.


When I asked him why he didn't bring it to me first (since he is a customer) his response was basically
have a fancy store like apple and since this is a fancy computer I assumed you couldn't work on it.  **sigh**


So I tell him I will do my best and will call him by end of day to let him know what I find.


I have a special adapter that allows me to basically convert the SSD drives that Apple uses to USB so I was pretty confident I could get the data off.  So I proceed to take apart the Air to remove the hard drive and to see if there are salvageable parts I notice that the keyboard ribbon cable is unhooked.


**sighing heavily** I plug in the keyboard cable and press the power button.  I hear the familiar apple tone and the Air boots back up exactly where the customer had left off.


I call the customer back and let him know what I've found and his problem the whole time was a disconnected keyboard cable (the power button is part of the keyboard hence you can't boot it)


I found out later that it sat at apple for over a week ""broken"" and that he'd already gone out and bought a brand new laptop and was outside of the return policy.

It was 2007 and I was deployed to a base called Kirkuk in Iraq.  The base was a joint Army and Air Force base.  We had two separate networks set up for the two services, some high-ranking Army General demanded an account on our network so he could access our resources.  Then he decided his aides needed to have access as well.  Then his whole office needed access.  Somehow, more and more Army guys got accounts set up on our network until it eventually became the standard that all Army personnel gets an Army and Air Force network account.

Now, but it also ensures that people don't access malicious websites and expose our network to hacking/viruses, etc.

Blocked websites weren't the only problems I had to deal with concerning Army personnel.  It was like these guys had absolutely no network training at all.  We had to enable port security on all our routers, we'd have to head over to their side of base and re-enable them locally.

Any given day

Okay

One particularly hot 140 degree day

It won't turn on.  I tipped it and some sand pours out of the back vent.  This is a common issue in the desert.  Sand gets everywhere.  So I shook it out as best I can and then remove the side panel to blow out the insides and check for damage.

Damn

The next thing I knew

When I got my bearings again, no blood.  No searing pain, just a dull ache all over, like I had just finished an intense workout.  I looked up to see people from a nearby building rushing toward the shack.  I made an effort to walk over there myself.

The shack was relatively small.  Two of the Army guys died instantly.  The guy I was helping was still alive

A few minutes later, he died in the ER.  I went to the hospital to get checked out and they just said I had a very minor concussion.  They gave me the rest of the day off and sent me back to work the next day.

At Kirkuk, set a really long timer, then ran away.  By the time it went off, they'd be long gone.  Most of the base was just open, empty space, but every now and then they'd get lucky and actually hit something.  This was one of those unfortunate days.

Now for the story:

About 18 months I was put in charge of setting up a new datacenter (New building and everything).  I arrive to a completely empty 15

Now to get us some internet.  I call up the NSP, Its Aliiiive!!

Then came more traffic (Some IPv6, firewalls and Viprions configured and ready for the servers.  I then disabled BGP until everything was completed.

The next two weeks were full of 18-wheelers dropping off a 500 racks, Cisco, NetApp and Panduit.  Then came the contractors: 6 to set install the cable trays and install the patch panels; a dozen to rack-and-stack the servers and cable them up; a dozen to image them.

All was right in my kingdom: servers had their OSes and applications; switches had their 40 GB trunks and joined to spanning tree; Drive arrays in the SANs were configured and prepared for use; cables were properly managed and labeled; the floors were cleaned and polished.  It was truly a heaven.

But there were dark clouds heading my way...

Launch Day came with much fan-fare, the champagne was at the ready.  There I sit at my laptop with my bosses and most of the C*Os, its the moment of truth.

My fingers did their dance typing 'bgp enable' on the router-cluster command prompt.

I declared ""Let there be light!""

The network came alive, I start to get nervous as this is well past our normal bandwidth use.  It continues rising 500 MB/s, 750...  1000... 1500.  I am full-on worried now.  The Viprions start freaking out over the number of HTTP/404's the web boxes are serving up, the number of failed FTP connections, rejected mail...  Logs show the requests are for domains that we don't control, and there is a lot of them.

Now I am panicking

I disable BGP again and call up the NSP and after some escalations I come to find out that $HostingProvider is still actually using that AS number and IPv4 Subnet and that I had just managed to take out almost 50

Now

I emailed her back and let her know that no changes had been made at all yet. I also explained that users can not install programs on their own because they don't have administrator rights. I made her a local administrator of all of the computers in her department so that she could authorize any updates or changes she sees fit.

**Rggoalie3**: What icons are you trying to rename?

1358565215.0,16uuzh,who said i am going to pay you for that?,catwiesel,772,189,49,"Hey

I've been on reddit for some time now


I do work as an IT certified specialist but it appears we have decent customers so I dont have much to tell. However


You see, I started working in a bar, shortly after, I sort of owned it. Anyway, it did not last (not my/our fault - the new owner of the bulding diddnt give us another lease since he diddnt want a bar in there) and being unemployed being frowned upon, I had to search for a new job.
Long story short


Please bare with me


Now
The owner was a guy


Few more details needed...
Above the bar were rooms for rent. They were reasonably priced. One of those in the 3rd floor was sort of an office (aka a bed and an old PC).
The music we played in this bar came from an Toshiba Vista Notebook.


So


Boss came in and told me to follow him in the ""kitchen"". There a package from an internet provider was lying around
I told him that it will be hard since I diddnt think the wifi would get up that high and that he would in all likely hood need to get a wifi repeater for ~ 50 eur so it would work.
But for now, said yes, I can and will set up the internet. He took a beer and went outside.
This was around 4pm in the afternoon on a weekday, they would not cause much work.


So I proceeded to look at the FritzBox which was hooked up. It was all wrong

M: ""setting up the internet""

H: ""what? who told you to do that now? what if a customer comes in?"" (he was pretty anal about not ""slacking"" (smoking/sitting/eating/drinking/doing anything besides standing at attention behind the bar))

M: ""well

H: ""no

So I stopped
And he did. Still I had no customers, connected it to the music laptop per wifi, gave it the providers info and had internet. the next few hours (no customers) the laptop was busy getting updates and more updates.
In that time I set up a second box I found lying around in the box as a wifi repeater.


At around midnight I closed down the bar since I did not have a single customer the whole day. I installed the wifi repeater in the 2nd story of the building and went to the office. wifi was available


I wrote down all the stuff I did and why, put it with the bar related paper that we had to do every evening and went home. It was 1am.


At 7am I woke to the frantic ringing of my cellphone. It was my boss demanding to know why I would write I worked until 1am when I closed the bar at midnight. I told hom because I set up the wifi for his office
He interrupted me
That was the last straw. All time slowed down. I had to take so much crap in the last year from this unimportant


M: ""Listen. If you even THINK that you MIGHT find someone else stupid enough to set up your internet, reset all the boxes and delete all the updates and give you your money back...""

Immediately he tried to backpaddle ""...well *stammer* it wasnt ment like that just ... you know ... we dont have money ... I diddnt know ...""

M: ""yeah... right""

H: ""still

M: ""...""


I turned around, I went there, gave him his key back and told him I will not be coming to work in 2 days. or ever again. I quit.


Probably one of the best decisions in my life. No 3 months later I had moved away and a better paying job with the best boss ever in IT (where I am still today)


I saw this guy at christmas again when 2 friends ""forced"" me to go to that bar since every other one was closed for the night already. He had trouble with his laptop and asked if I could have a look. I supressed my laughter, when I am sober. He did not call me the next day... And I was not sad about that. Not even a bit...

Since they were well recieved

This takes place early summer 2002

This is the tale of the angry printer. And no

I walk into the office at 07:55 Thursday morning to start the 08:00 shift, a customer to [Radio LAN ISP] have reported an issue. His Internet is down. Very well.

Me: ""[ISP] support.""
Printer:  ""Hello
Me: ""Alright

I check in the system. This guy has bought class 1 support. It means he pays a lot extra to have 24 hour guarantee on his connection. [ISP] is required to restore his connection within 24 hours. Not business hours. 24 hours. And we're required to tell him just that

Me: ""Hi

Printer: ""Good. Please ask the technicians to hurry up. We got class 1 support because we need it. You see, so our backup modem connection will not cut it. I have seven people standing around doing nothing because we have nothing to print. This is costing me a lot of money.""

Me: ""I will add this to the case and call the techs.""

Printer: ""Thankyou.""

So

I return to work

Come Friday, should have been fixed by now. The case has been updated with 'tested - no contact with the customer's local equipment' but nothing more.

Me: ""[ISP] support.""

Angry printer: ""This is [owner] from  [small printing firm FAR up north]. Our connection is still down. The customer number is [XXX].""

Me: ""Sorry about that

Angry printer: ""And don't tell me it will be fixed in 24 hours

Me: ""Looks like they have tried to reach the local equipment...""

Angry printer: ""I know that already. Have you done NOTHING since then? Tell them to get their arse out of the wagon!""

Me: ""I will contact them immediately. It should be fixed within 24 hours...""

Angry printer: ""Well it is not. Get to it! Goodbye!""

At this time, even if he was angry. So I updated the case, called the techs and left a message when they did not reply.

Then it was a sweet

When I get back for the 11:00 shift on Monday

Teamleader: ""[vonadler]

Me: ""Sure.""

So I check. There has been no update from the techs. We have done our part - we have informed the customer that his connection will be fixed within 24 hours (as we are required to do) which seems to send him off into a spin each time

Me: ""Hey

Teamleader: ""Hey [vonadler].""

Me: ""I checked the case. We've done everything that the contract say we should do and then some. It is [ISP] that has not fixed this guy's connection as they should have.""

Teamleader: ""Thanks

Yet

On Tuesday morning

On Tuesday afternoon

Me: ""[ISP] support.""

Tech: ""Hi

Me: ""Hi. How is it going? Can you fix the connection""

Tech: ""Unfortunately

Me: ""Sure.""

Tech: ""Ok

Me: ""Molten?""

Tech: ""Yeah

So I update the case and call the angry printer to inform him that they are working on the issue.

Me: ""They are onsite now

Angry printer: ""Yeah, it is Tuesday now, and I reported this issue on Thursday!""

But spare parts like that does not come quickly. [ISP] suffered badly from the dotcom crash and was close to bankrupcy. They did not have those parts on hand

And the angry printer called in. Three to four times a day

Two weeks after the initial report

Me: (cringing in fear) ""[ISP] support.""

Angry printer: ""I am sorry for what I have to do now. You know who I am and what my issue is. When will it be fixed.""

Me: ""Within 24 hours?""

Angry printer: ""**WITHIN 24 HOURS? YOU HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS FOR TWO WEEKS? ARE YOU INBRED CRETINS, HERE, EVERY FUCKING DAY. I HAVE PAID** [tens of thousands of dollars] **OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS TO HAVE CLASS 1 SUPPORT, AND YOU DON'T GIVE A SHIT? YOU RETARDED FUCKING SCUMBAGS, YOU DEVILSPAWNED STINKING INCOMPETENT MONKEYS! HOW IS IT EVEN POSSIBLE TO BREATHE WITH YOUR MIND-NUMBINGLY LOW IQ? HOW DO YOU EVEN DIFFER BETWEEN YOUR OWN MOTHERS AND THE SLIME AT THE BOTTOM OF THE AQUARIUM? HOW IS IT EVEN POSSIBLE TO BE SO INCOMPETENT? IT GOES EVEN AGAINST THE LAWS OF PHYSICS!!!**""

Me: ""I will put this in the case.""

Angry printer: ""YOU DO THAT! BYE!""

This went on for another week before they managed to fix his connection. Three to four times a day. The worst part was that the customer was right. He had paid a LOT of money to have a secure connection with 24 hour guarantee because he knew he was dependent on his Internet working. The relief was massive when we got an e-mail from [ISP] saying the issue was fixed. Then

Me: ""[ISP] support.""

Angry printer: ""You know who this is.""

Me (cringing in fear): ""Yes.""

Angry printer: ""Don't worry. I know it is not your personal fault. I just wanted to call and tell you I have terminated all contracts with [ISP]

Me (with extreme relief): ""Thanks for letting us know. Bye.""

We did the human wave to massive cheering all over the office. So loudly that even the managers came out of their offices wonering what was going on.

So I start walking this lady through the menus to rescan for channels.  I tell her what buttons to press and what the TV should show...she would say ""okay"".  Typically we get them to the point where the box is scanning for channels (which takes a while)

So I get her there and ask her if she sees the progress bar and if she can tell me what the signal quality is.  

""Ummm

""Okay...that's odd.  When did the menus go away and the screen turn fuzzy again?""

I'm an electronics technician/electrician by training which pretty means I can work on anything that has electricity running through it.

We have a saying called RTFM. Most people don't realize how many answers a manual will give you. Hence my first story

Two engineers had been charged with setting up a facility to install configuration settings in some specialized equipment.

It took them about six months to become operational. Once they did become operational

Boss man hands me the trouble ticket when it comes in asking for another power supply changeout. These things were not cheap

I arrived at the facility and took a look at the problem and talked to the engineers. They repeated their need for a new power supply and pointed towards a new one all ready to be tied into the buildings electrical supply.

I took a minute and looked at the gear and the error codes that they were getting. I asked the engineers for their book on the power supply. The power supply was shutting down due to overtemp. I looked at how filthy the filters were and realized that this was an easy fix.

""Is it OK if I just fix it or do you want me to replace it?"" I asked.

""You can fix it? Go ahead.""

In plain view of the engineers

This was the fourth power supply that they had gone through.

Once the engineers realized how much money that they had blown on replacement power supplies they made one comment.

""Please don't tell anyone.""

Bonus: Routine maintenance instructions were on a label on the side of the power supply.

TLDR: Why you no read the f'ing manual?

Then, she didn't postpone it for '4 hours'. She does it for right. now. I am pissed off at this point.

So I've arranged to have a lot of spare time on my hands at this one government job

And by this, writing down the numbers on a piece of paper, doing basic math on said numbers, and then punching the final handful of figures into a template report which is then physically printed out, goes off to HQ in the internal mailbag, and is probably binned.

It occurs to me that this is the kind of thing computers were invented for. If only there were a guy like me around to automate it.

Wait a moment - **I'm** a guy like me!
   
  
   
So I use the supplied increment and decrement commands in the scripting language to create a library of basic math functions, subtracted, multiplied and whatever to get the final result, which is simultaneously displayed on the screen and printed out on the manager's printer as a one-page summary.

The whole process takes about fifteen minutes from go to whoa, go have a nice cup of coffee, and have all her Friday workload done and printed out by the time she got back to her desk.

The first part of the deinstallation is notifying users that the system will be going away and that they need to migrate to the VAX 8850.

The VMS operating system could display messages when you logged in. The UNIX equivalent of motd. Since users are notoriously bad at ignoring login announcements I would put in fancy ASCII banners and ring the terminal bell several times.  I would also change the banners around every few days so they would hopefully notice that something had changed. I would also change the data on the message and change up the wording a bit.

I'm a journalist, not a tech support guy, but I fix what need to be fixed, and while doing so, this sounds simple enough. Well no.

The first server I checked into was fairly easy to figure out. It had all the stuff we actually work on. Articles

The next one was slightly more tricky. After poking around a bit I realized there was a shared folder called ""Archive"" in the C:/ root directory. This turned out to be an old image archive

When I got to server number three I had to figure out what was actually on it before I could begin looking for the actual hardware. As soon as a tried connecting to it it disappeared from the list of available servers

Server number four was also located at an undisclosed location, a shared ""User"" folder, complete with sample photos, sample videos, sample music, **and nothing more!** After looking through every single server here I realized it was one of the desktop computers. Why all the files were shared I have no idea. There was Literally NOTHING there.

Then finally. Server number five was impossible to connect to. The name didn't give me any information, and it isn't now, and never has been connected to out network. I figured it couldn't be that one. The other one wasn't even plugged in to anything, no power no nothing. It had apparently been sitting like that since we got it, years ago, never having been connected. OK, can't be that on either. I look through the entire bloody building, nothing apart from an old broken HP mediaserver sitting on a shelf in a room we never use. None of us know who it belongs to or where it comes from. It has the name of a person. A person in no way connected with this company. Hell if know... I still don't know where that last server is.

At the end of the day I found that we have two working servers. One of which we actually use. One desktop PC sharing its library, one broken mystery server sitting on a shelf, and one phantom server that makes no sense what so ever. A total of 7 servers. Quick math. We there are 7 servers. 2 aren't ours. Out of the remaining 5, one doesn't exist and one isn't a server. So from our total of what is supposed to be 5 servers, we have 7, but still only five...

After a few mins my techs tell me that two laptop screens have blown - looks like the backlight had popped.  Odd but not so odd as to raise an eyebrow.  Dell come and take them apart and put in new screens as per warantee.

A week later we have reason to have a couple of the same model laptops in the office and the screen pops on one of them.

I have a rant but the techy doing the job googles and after a while finds out.....
The laptops have magnets in the case to detect when the lid is shut - rather than a physical switch - so when you stack them up the laptop on the top is affected by the laptop underneath and the screen goes out.  Strangely it doesnt seem to come back on again when you move it..

So we phoned Dell to tell them that they had wasted their time and to ask them to make a note of it.  You can imagine how that went down with the call centre.

~~~~ wavy lines indicating impending flashback ~~~~

Year and years ago I was working for a one store high street PC shop (One Step Beyond

A roving sales guy occasionally rung in new business, and a bunch of other stuff for webdesign and graphic manipulation. It was also my first introduction to a Wacom tablet. 

Pretty expensive bit of kit

""It doesn't work"" she yells.

""Errm... what doesn't work exactly""

""This bloody computer""

""Yes

""It doesn't do my graphics

*...extended conversation with increasing horror and confusion on my part and furious rage on her part...*

So it transpires that she isn't a Graphic Designer. She's simply heard about being a graphic designer

She genuinely expected Photoshop to literally draw stuff for her. She had no clue. I can only imagine she sat in front of the computer and did [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hShY6xZWVGE).

It ended up with her threatening to come down to the shop with placards and her kids

One day the assistant to the COO comes running to me about a potential security breach and describes someone trying to ""hack"" into a computer.  It's a typical hit-and-run, so they did full virus, spyware, rootkit scans to no avail.  However, to upper management, ""erratic mouse behavior"" is a clear sign that someone is h4x0ring your company and stealing your dataz.  Hey, the CEO configured a switch once

The whole hacking idea gets upper management spun up and they task me with locating a suspected mole in the company who they think is funneling customer data to the competition.  Funny they ask me this, looking for anything unusual.  As I'm neck deep in SQL audit logs one of the helpdesk guys runs over and says ""Hey, it's doing it again, come look"".

I walk over to the vacant workstation and sure enough the mouse cursor is wandering around the screen.  It's at a locked log in screen and the movement doesn't coincide with any elements on the screen, clicking all over the place.  ""Hey, J, move your mouse to the left"".  She moves her mouse to the left, the mouse on the screen jitters to the left.  I peek behind the computer and find that the help desk guys had left the wireless receiver plugged in after they replaced the mouse.  Why? Because the keyboard needed the receiver.  And everyone in the area had the same $30 Logitech Keyboard/Mouse combo.

Unfortunately the avalanche that was started with the hacked mouse cursor had already broken away from the top of the mountain and was picking up speed.  The DBA who was being investigated opened his mouth to the COO about something that set off the lawyers (who were already on edge over the data breach) so they fired him.  And anyone who worked with him, 15-20 people in IT were canned within the week.  The only people left were the IT manager, a handful of developers, the help desk guys, and one network admin.

The most ironic part?  The data breach was not perpetrated by the DBA, and they fired all of the technical people who could have bailed them out.

Now Read On...  

----

Working to keep two thousand top-level civil servants happy day-to-day meant a lot of running around, and reassembly of approximately a thousand PCs across many floors of government offices, over the course of a single weekend.  

Hell no.  

...and volunteers would get double overtime bonuses.  

Hell yes!  
   

And so it was that I found myself and four other ~~penniless bastards~~ strapping volunteers walking into the workplace on a Saturday morning for a rundown on which computers in which locations were being moved to what desks on other floors where. This was not so much a problem in the cases where the move was taking place on the same building floor (and both sides of the floor were accessible from each other instead of there being a wall in the way), tote the PC (and CRT monitor, of course) to the other side of the building, plunk on desk, reassemble and remember to plug the network cable back in.  

We got started with these in order to warm up and because it was easy to keep track of each other - just yell across the floor. And it wasn't too hard - the most annoying bit was lugging a desktop case and 17"" glass tube in one go while trying to make sure none of the accessories got dropped along the way

So far

Then came everything else.  
   
  
It turns out that it takes a significantly longer time to stump across a floor-maze with a double-armful of IT kit, juggle the kit again to press the floor button, ride the elevator, trudge across the other floor, dump the gear and reconnect it, and then walk all the way back. We started to fall behind schedule. By the end of the day, we'd done perhaps 35-40% of the total moves

Sunday, and, uh 'borrowed' them. They weren't anything fancy, just giant skateboards with long handles on, but you could fit maybe three, four computers on them at a time. Surely with this increase in productivity, we could transport everything so efficiently we'd be done by lunch!  
   
  
...yeah.  
   
  
Lunch rolled around

And then someone found the tubs.  

The plastic storage/transport tubs were apparently used at one point to transport large amounts of physical mail around the building. These things were about three feet high, you know what I'm talking about. We saw them, and instantly realised that there might be a chance to make this work after all. One ~~blatant theft~~ *borrowing* of the tubs later, our new PC transportation regime went like this:  

1) Everyone showed up to the source location for a move. We then proceeded to rip the PCs apart like we were looking for gold coins in the wreckage.  
2) The base units and monitors would get tossed into the tubs, twelve at a time - a dangerously swaying tower of breakable IT kit. Then, a trolley-wrangler, a stablizer, and someone carrying twelve sets of keyboards and mice would hoof it pronto to the nearest elevator.  
3) Everyone left behind would continue stripping PCs down
4) Meanwhile, and the process repeated.  
   
  
Effectively, putting parts-puzzles to rights, or booking it between those two ever-changing locations with an unstable cartload of expensive things. HUT HUT HUT!  

With fifteen minutes to spare, or their keyboards weren't responding, or their screens were upside-down... still, out of a thousand moves under heavy time constraints, even our management acknowledged there were always going to be one or two which needed a little fine-tuning.  

It was, which I'd dubbed Cthulhu's Desktop...  
   
  
   
...but that's a story for another time.

Now Read On...

---  

[In the last exciting episode](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/u5yeu/weeklong_rebuilds_let_me_see_that/)

It was about this time that, into the Helpdesk area, crack the case, attach a floppy drive, and so on and so forth, simply to rearrange the bits on the hard drive. After all, they all had network connections
   

So I looked at the build disk images, and then just pulling down the workstation software. Pretty simple. In fact, there was really no reason to run them from floppy at all except that it was convenient when the hard disk got formatted.  

Now, but management didn't want to do that. Sigh. Thus the whole debacle with floppies and the related schlepping of PC carcasses back and forth.  

*However*, the repartitioning and reformatting processes were separated out into a batch file of their own, the entire rest of the build process (sixty to ninety minutes) could be run to completion from the hard disk.  
   
  
Hmm!  
   
  
Some slicing and dicing later, kick off the build process, and then clean up after itself. And while we couldn't get approval for a keyboard stuffer capable of driving FDISK, FORMAT was fully automatable from the command line.  

(And yes
   
  
Workstation rebuilds now consisted of:  
- stick a floppy in the workstation and reboot;  
- choose an OS (it would write a flag file to the floppy);  
- fly through the FDISK repartition options;  
- watch the workstation fast-format automatically and copy files down to the hard disk; and  
- eject the floppy and boogie on back to the Helpdesk while the workstation self-built.  
   
  
After a couple of process refinements (sticking an A4 sheet over the keyboard saying ""DO NOT TOUCH UNLESS THE SCREEN LOOKS LIKE THIS [end-of-build screenshot], it didn't waste much tech time - and certainly less than having to crack a case, attach a drive, run upstairs to the server room each time etc - and we could GBTW in five or ten minutes. From the user perspective, a week-long process which had dropped to one day was now almost entirely completable over a lunch break. Scheduling most of the rebuilds for lunches or at the end of the day also enabled us to minimize disruption to employees and teams overall in cases where a PC needed rebuilding but was still more-or-less running and being used.  

   

The best bit? Users could now no longer play the old ""Oh the computer is busted, and most managers in the public service at the time would not assign your work to someone else if you were only offline for two hours - you just had to suck it up and work harder. Particularly if one of those hours was your lunch break anyway!  

Funny, suddenly found their best work-avoidance excuse utterly destroyed in the weeks that followed. I got a LOT of ""Oh God no"" looks when I cheerfully informed them *and their boss* that instead of a week's downtime, I could now have them up and running in ninety minutes flat, and that they could use a workstation in the next section over in the meantime so they wouldn't miss a *single minute* of work...
  
   
  
Of course
   
  
...but that's a story for another time.

This happened on one of those times.

The support ticket starts with the client just copying and pasting an error message, or why exactly its an error). Turns out that ssh wasn't responding on the server and the client was logged into WHM trying to restart it through there, but it was failing.

I check our back end system for the root password for this server and immediately regret it. The password is 64 characters long, and symbols. Granted, contrats on a secure password, but you've just ensured the fact that I will not be able to log into this server. For shits and giggles I do write it down and walk down the hallway to see if I can type it quick enough.

No. Not even close. Only could make it about half way through the password before the log in prompt would reset itself. After two more tries

Nothing is ever easy, since I'm physically standing infront of their actual server's hardware with a physical keyboard and mouse, its somewhat hard to copy and paste from one system to another.

Thankfully, try starting sshd only to find it giving permissions errors. ""Well, that's odd."" I think to myself. I then try restarting another service just as a test, only to find I don't have permission to do that either. Thinking I might be going crazy, I look at the prompt, and yes, I am logged in a root, everything looks right. Then check the permissions on it.

Its owned by a cpanel user. Check the permissions in /etc/init.d/. Everything is owned by a cpanel user. Check a few other directories...all owned by a cpanel user.

At this point

There are a few chowns on a couple files and folders

chown -R &lt;cpanel user&gt;:&lt;cpanel user&gt; /

We begin our story shortly after I started my job with the company. I'd had some experience working on computers from a few high school classes, my college degree was in Engineering Tech: Robotics. As I had only been there a couple months, I was still in that phase of ""Oh god, I'm gonna screw something up and get fired."" However, I had thankfully already mastered the art of **bullshit**.

This fine evening, their cerner account would be locked, so they'd have to call in to have it unlocked. Well... this doctor had the unfortunate bad luck of having it happen to him multiple times that day. So by the time he gets to me, he's rather upset. The call goes something a little like this...

**Me:** ""Thank you for calling the Derp Service Desk

*information is gathered*

**Me:** ""Thank you

**Doctor:** ""It's these damn C5 units! I've gotten locked out of Cerner again! This is the 4th time today! You know

**Me:** ""... I'm sorry, it's nothing we have any control over.""

**Doctor:** ""SEE!? There you go passing the buck again! You're letting people die every day because you can't man up and take responsibility! This issue needs to be fixed NOW""

**Me:** ""Sir, sir.""

**Doctor:** ""That's unacceptable. Now

**Me:** ""... Yes sir. I will be sure to do this at the very next staff meeting. It's unacceptable

**Doctor:** ""Good. It's nice to see someone listens to their betters these days.""

I went on to unlock his account again, that since I've been employed here... we've never had a staff meeting. But the next one we do...

One day this unpleasant older lady comes in.  At this point I'd been there long enough to be able to smell the bad ones from ten yards, but I greet her in my usual cheerful fashion and ask what I can do for her.

&gt;""I'm here to pick up the computer my husband dropped off.  You guys have had it for ever but the guy finally said it was ready.""

Well crap, and she's just going to flip when I tell her I'm going to have to call the number on the ticket and ask permission to release it.

Sighing inwardly and putting off the inevitable a moment in the vain hopes that her name is on it somewhere in addition to her husband's

It's not there.

I check the completed section.  I check the waiting-for-stuff section.  Nada.  Oh cock.

I go back out and verify the name.  I ask if there's another name it might be under.  I return to the back, still nothing.

OK

I go back out and say ""I'm sorry

And with that

&gt;""WHAT DO YOU MEAN

""Ma'am, I can look it up in our system and it'll give me a better idea where to look"".  Thinking possibly it got sent off for service for a hardware fault we couldn't do in-store.  Or at least I'll find notes on it saying it's definitely completed, or actually waiting for OS discs, or something.

I finally coax her number out of her and plug it in. Still nothing.  Fuck.  I ask if there's another number it might be under

&gt;""YOU'VE LOST MY COMPUTER, AND THE GUY FINALLY CALLED THIS MORNING TO SAY IT WAS READY AND NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU'VE LOST IT???""

Now I'm starting to get confused.  I'm pretty sure if we'd had a system for that long I'd know about it - as I said

I ask her if she has the receipt, and with that I can DEFINITELY track it; ticket numbers are infallible.  Of course, she doesn't, her husband probably has it at home, despite our repeated reminders to customers that if they want anyone else to pick it up, they HAVE to have the receipt.  I have nothing else to go on, though, but she pulls out her phone anyway.

After a few words to him (none of which were ""do you have the receipt for the computer"", but I need this damn ticket number from him.  I finally get a word in edgewise to ask him for the info off the receipt.  He won't give it to me, he just keeps yelling.

Then, the person who did our calling that day was called Tabitha, so something wasn't right.

I say ""one moment, I pick up our phone, and dial the other big-box store in the same shopping center that also services computers.  I get my friend who works there.

""Hi Nate

I go back out and say ""Ma'am

And in a blissful moment, she says, ""he swore he dropped it off here.  He must not have had his coffee that morning"".  And turns and walks out, without even so much as a ""sorry I was such a colossal c**tpuffin to you for the last 20 minutes"".

[Chapter 1 - My first job in IT](http://redd.it/xtlhx) 

[Chapter 2 - Store uniforms](http://redd.it/xyazr)

[Chapter 3 - Spring Cleaning](http://redd.it/y5gz5)

* * *

I had been working in the store for a good half year by now and the summer vacation was just a few weeks away. Working in the store had been good for the last few weeks. The regular customers were finally accustomed to me and did not ogle as much anymore and uncomfortable interactions were at an all time low. Not responding to the webcam offer probably had made its rounds and made the creeps give up hope and move to other things.

Don had a newfound love for playing video games and was locked up in his office for hours on end. I did not know what he was playing

Richard and Frank were in the back working on the computers

I was cleaning up the store

A middle-aged woman came into the store. She had an old IBM Thinkpad in her hands and I signaled her to go up to the counter.

When we both got to the counter she put down the Thinkpad and I asked her what was wrong. She told me that she had bought the computer here over a year ago and was using it without any problems until yesterday. She had been typing an e-mail on her computer when it just died. She had tried to turn it back on again

I checked with a different charger; nothing. I tried with a different battery; nothing again. I now had to tell her the problem was probably with the power management on the motherboard. To be sure

“But I have a warranty!” she said with a somewhat threatening voice. “Only for the first 6 months, and honestly I could understand that. “I’ll see what other options we have for you.” I checked the store computer if we had any comparable notebooks in the back that could replace the broken one. We did; the exact same model with a slightly better processor. She asked what the price would be. “$249,” I said, “and we will switch the hard drive so you will still have all your files.”

She did not want it. Knowing that we had another computer

By now she had made enough noise for Jeremy to come to the counter as well. Her face lit up. Not thinking anything else of it, I don’t do girls, sweetie.”

Before us now stood a 40-something woman with her top off. She probably was pretty back when she was my age, but wasn’t obese. Jeremy quickly replied with what had to be his magnum opus: “The fact that I work with old computers doesn’t mean I like all old things.” Her personality sphere malfunctioned; it was a critical hit on her system. Jeremy continued on, “please pull up your top and either pay for the repairs or leave the store.” I was laughing at this moment, adding to her anger.

Her charm had not worked. She demanded to speak to the boss. Neither Jeremy or me wanted to deal with her anymore today. We told her Don was out for the day and would be back tomorrow morning. She left

When I came in that afternoon the first thing I did was to check the stockpile of notebooks. The ThinkPad was nowhere to be found. I did not want to know what happened this morning. Don’s office was closed as usual

Jeremy later went into his office to look at his internet history: he had been looking up dating advice all day.

* * *
 
So this next story happened about a few weeks before Richard and Frank got fired and may involve trace amounts of time travel. So
 
I was working in the store when a father and son came in. The father was a man in his late 50s and looked like a mix of a British lord and a crazy scientist. The son was a perfect stereotype of a Hollywood computer geek with an extra dash of social awkwardness.

They were looking for a new notebook he could use for college. He would be studying computer science in the fall

“My son deserves the very best notebook to make his study a success, I should have said something along the lines of, “and thats why you chose our store, you will only find the very best quality here.” However, I know I could not have said that with a straight face.

I tried to pry out some more information about his needs, a good CPU and enough options to upgrade the memory and storage. We actually had some decent notebooks in our shop.

The father was a self proclaimed computer scientist himself

I tried to explain that the megahertz of the CPU were only part of the performance of a computer; there were many other factors to consider. He looked at his son and asked him if he knew about this. Still uncomfortable with the entire situation the son silently said that yes

The father did not care to apologize for his stupidity and quickly changed the subject to one of the other notebooks - a rather old off-brand notebook. This computer was from 2005 and nothing special. It was too late; he was in love with it. It was perfect

At the register

“You and my son seem to have a lot in common, “We probably do. Your total will come to $499; how would you like to pay?” He ignored my question. “Do you play any computer games? He plays them constantly.” I looked at him and said “I share a Gamecube with my sister, how do you want to pay?”. He ignored my question again and kept asking questions. Finally he asked how much he should add to the $499 to have me go on a date with his son. His son hid his face in shame, he wanted to leave. “Can you stop asking these questions and just pay your total?” I asked. Not taking half measures I added “I have a boyfriend anyway”. He refused to believe me and now got a little aggressive, demanding a photo of this boyfriend of mine before he was going to pay. I was never going to get rid of him. I had become more assertive by now, standing my ground and about to cancel the transaction. 

Suddenly Richard and Frank got out of the back and walked up to me, is there anything we can do for you?”. The father was shocked by this love triangle. He quickly grabbed his son and walked out. Richard and Frank had been listening in the back from the beginning and had seen their opportunity. I was happy they did, though I felt like smashing my head into the glass counter afterwards.

So a gentleman enters my store with a computer problem. Specifically, the screen comes ON. After it runs for about 30 seconds, it shuts itself down.

I'm flummoxed. If it were memory, and offer to hold it for our standard diag cost.

I take it into the back, the machine comes to life! It posts and then goes into windows!

What... what the hell? So I fiddle around with it for a bit

Cycle the power a couple of times

I decide I'll start with some component replacement. I know it isn't the HDD, power, nothing new. Replace that one and start working my way towards the other memory bank. Since I had to disassemble half the laptop to get to that one, I decided to look for any scorching that might indicate a short or heat damage.

It was by sheer dumb luck that I saw [this](http://i.imgur.com/Clv6RkK.jpg).

Now, ever, in all my years of working with computers, seen one of those connections get damaged like that before or since. This particular cable goes to the top bezel.

Pow. I yank the cable from it's other end, replace the cables, machine wont start. Yank em again, machine comes to life again! I send it through a series of reboots (restarts, power downs, battery out, battery in, AC in

I call the customer. Actually

THEN I called the customer.

PM: ""Hello Sir

Cust: ""Oh

PM: ""Well sir, and we found scorching on them to indicate that they were in fact shorting out. I've honestly never seen this kind of damage before, I didn't even know it was possible. Have you recently taken this computer somewhere else for service?""

Cust: ""Actually yes! I took it to Nerd Patrol a little while back to have them replace the keyboard.""

PM: ""And you didn't try to get into it to replace the keyboard yourself?""

Cust: ""No

PM: ""You are a very wise man.""

The customer comes to pick it up, since it was technically fixed during the diagnostic. I suggested that the next time he need work done, he bring it to us first.

Here's some history of the building I had to visit.  When this building was first turned into a bank, they upgraded to BNC network connections for the PCs, which required running coax for each terminal.  The continued to use the 25-pair cables for the phones. After that, they ran CAT-5 for the PCs, still using the 25-pair connections for the phones.  Some time in the early 00s, they remodeled the place completely.  New CAT-5 was run for the PC and the phone for each office and teller station.  The termination points on the 25-pair cables and BNC cabling were cut off and stuffed into the wall, then the boxes were covered with blank plates.

What they never did during all of this, and old CAT-5 were all still there, in a huge rat's nest in the corner of the comm. room.  The new cables were terminated very neatly on a rack right above this, with all the new runs tightly bound together and disappearing into the ball of unused insulated copper below it.

One day, all the others in the branch are working.  I grabbed a spare phone, my phone tools, and a couple cables, then went out to see them.  I arrived and verified what the user was saying.  Yep, dead phone.  I replaced the cable going from the phone to the wall.  Nope, still dead.  I replaced the phone.  Nope

Now things get to be a pain.  I re-terminated the phone jack in the office, re-terminate with a new box, and attach the box to the side of the rack.

In order to move the wire that far, then replacing the strapping on the remaining bundle.  Finally, I got down to the last strap, stuck right in the middle of the rat's nest.

At this point, using the velcro strapping like rungs on a ladder.

I screamed like a little girl and jumped back, thinking I must have hurt myself.  They sew me, backing out of the room, a mess of IT debris, and a rat, perched on the rack.  After a few seconds of staring, it scampered down the cable bundle and disappeared into the same hole in the wall as all the cables.

After a visit from an exterminator and an electrician, until it finally bit through a live one, causing the phone to die.  Thankfully, the manager was able to convince the electrician running the replacement cable to pull out all of the old ones that weren't being used, hopefully preventing future rodent visitations.

Some time ago

6 months prior to the incident, keeping house, changing diapers, and trying to get sleep where possible. Having a super-colicy baby is no cake walk and both my wife and I were beyond tired and stressed all the time. 

I was off the on-call rotation this particular week, made plans, and dropped our 6mo daughter off with my parents across town for the first time ever.

About halfway through the movie, though we never got on-call calls when off the schedule. If I'm getting a call now... something serious is going down. My co-worker was the first to call. I ignored it and continued with the movie. My manager rang my phone moments later, and again, I ignored it being off schedule on my first date in who-knows-how-long. Another minute passes and my director rings me. This one I can't ignore, something must be seriously messed up for him to step in at this point. I take the call outside the theater door.

""You need to get down here asap. I know you're off rotation

I told my wife what had happened and she reluctantly agreed we'd have to reschedule. I was usually the day-saver there

I rush to work while formulating a plan in my head. I had facilities on the phone gathering some extension cords for me. I had my co-worker on the phone next

When I got there, and a IDF panel in the back of the casino. After a few minutes of cross-parking-lot cable stringing, plug and play, and finger crossing, we were able to establish a link between the remote IDF and the core in our NOC. Slowly but surely, remote network gear came back online and we had to reconfigure the systems to work over the new link. At a blazing single 10/100, we were back in business. Temporarily. No comparison for 3 pair of fiber strands

We had an emergency repair service come in and help us patch up what was left of the mangled fiber. The runs were pulled so hard

We were able to patch in a few unused links from another run, so we had a bit of time to get some new runs set up over the next two weeks.

After re-establishing the temp fiber links, and brought everything back up. Everything came back up FF, and we were ""restored"". My total time on property was about from 5:30pm to about 12:30am to address the issue. Total downtime was about 45-50 minutes, iirc.

1374523171.0,1iu1fn,Sometimes it is the simple things.,Ormuzd,621,85,70,"I’ve lurked this page for a while now and always thought about submitting a few of my stories but they all seemed a little run of the mill. Until something that happened a few months ago that finally came full circle.  I think I may have finally found my white whale.  Prepare for a wall of text (sorry).

Toward the beginning of this year we moved into a brand new building.  It is a wonder of modern technology that literally everything can be controlled via one of our central networking rooms.  One room for building management (HVAC, the works) and one for networking and IT.  I was one of the few people that got to spend a lot of the time in the building during the construction phase so I know where just about everything is.  Generally I tend to be more a database and networking guy but I love to get my hands dirty and will play with about anything people will let me so my current job has expended to handling most of the minor problems we experience when moving into a new building (read as “shit breaks”).  And thusly I have been requesting a raise due to all the added job duties I’ve been performing which management had been abruptly ignoring.

So fast forward to about mid May as temperatures start to get over 100*F (38*C).  I come into the office at about 8:00, eventually settling on “There is nothing I can do from my desk here so I’ll walk over to the facilities room and see what is going on then give you a call back.”  She hangs up and I start checking though all the emails that have piled up when I notice all of these people have similar office numbers, then it hits me the A/C handler for their part of the building (which mostly consist of the higher-ups) has completely stopped working.  

As I get over to the facilities room I hear the ominous beeping coming from one of the terminals.  When I turn the monitor on the first thing I see is the red warning text saying; “Air handler #X FAILED, is there anything else you can do?”  Not wanting to say no, because then my day would just get worse since I was already in the email chain I would be dealing with it either way at my desk I say, “I can go check the physical unit while I try to call the factory guys maybe they can tell me what fault 26 is and if it is simple I can fix it, or maybe they can tell me how to reroute some of the cooling from another part of the building to you guys.”  It is at the point that I find out I was on speaker phone with her and the President was listening to what was being done when he speaks up thanking me for working on this for them.  They hang up and I find the number for the manufacture prominently displayed on the screen of the computer with the error message and call them only to find out they are in a different time zone and do not open for 2 more hours.  It is at the point I realize this day is going to be my own personal hell.  I say fuck it and start walking up to the maintenance area because being anywhere someone else can contact me is out of the question at this point.  

When I get to the air handler room everything is dead quit and actually kind of peaceful.  I stand in the middle of the room staring at this huge machine that I’ve ever only seen once during construction when I was helping hook it up the network for the facilities guys.  As I’m walking around it I notice a piece 1” conduit lying in the middle of the floor completely out of place.  I kick it up against the wall and look at the side of the machine where it was laying when I notice a white box about the size of a small computer tower with a small  screen on it that says “Fault 26: Power interrupted” with 2 options ‘restart’ and ‘view error log’.  It also has a nice scratch down the front of it that goes right over a few of the other buttons.  That is when it hits me

2 months go by and no other major issues have popped up.  I managed to track down the missing tech that was working the facilities room alone that day only to find out he had been in the hospital with food poisoning.  We had a good laugh over the story and he bought me a bottle of Jack as payment for my troubles.  Mid July comes around which means the mid year awards ceremony, few people outside of the techs know who I am and all of them are too slack jawed to say anything.  I make my way up toward the stage while he tells an abbreviated and kind of exaggerated story of how I had gone above and beyond to fix the AC for their offices.  I accept the award and shake hands when he informs me this award comes with a bonus and the raise I had been asking for plus some.  I just stand there kind of stunned when from all the way in the back my fellow tech guys burst into applause.

TL;DR: Reset a computer and justified my existence to management.  Got paid.

Joe was the top trader for our company's highest revenue trading desk. It was Monday morning shortly after market open following a weekend of major developments in his sector. A few minutes downtime could cost his business tens of thousands of dollars and I was the only first-line support guy in the office.

The prior emergency I was rushing to attend melted into insignificance. I doubled back for the stock room and with a new keyboard under my arm I sprinted the length of the maintenance corridor to burst onto the middle of the trading floor opposite Joe's desk.

Joe had a Bloomberg keyboard and as anyone who has seen one will testify

""The bloody keyboard is bloody knackered"" said Joe in his thick cockney London accent. ""I'm losing money 'ere

A quick visual inspection revealed nothing obvious. In fact Joe's desk was a conspicuously tidy example of sanitation compared to his fellow traders

Typing on his pristine keyboard produced nothing but the mouse was working fine. I ducked under the desk to check cables but everything was plugged in properly. With no time to troubleshoot the new keyboard was swiftly unboxed and cabled up through the desk conduits to his workstation below. A quick switch of the connectors and a working Caps Lock light confirmed it was alive.

""So, these things happen"" I reassured him. ""I'll take the old one away.""

This, did not stop him from completely micro-managing our IT department on a daily basis (which really wasn't his job anymore), but obviously it wasn't the best way to manage.

He was also extremely head strong and would never admit when he was wrong, it had been the way for quite some time, and given it's operational state, definitely wasn't anywhere near a critical state, plus we were in the process of setting up a new Exchange 2003 server that we would migrating everyone to in the very near future.

* * *

My days as the vengeful wench of the east had passed and I was back to working in the store. It had been two months of nothing and by now it was already November. My trip to Sweden with 3 of my friends was only memories
 
While I was mindlessly browsing on the internet behind the counter
 
The customer was dressed in a blue-black business suit that was 3 sizes too big for him. It was actually quite the accomplishment as he would easily hit 400lbs (180kg) on the scale. He wore unmatching light brown shoes underneath the suit. He missed the necktie and an overall sense of how a suit should be worn. Girls do take notice of your clothes.
 
He stood in the store with a sense of authority. I wanted to walk up to him, shouted “I AM JUST BROWSING!” No help? Fine by me. He started looking at the notebooks on display one by one and was shaking his head at each of them, mumbling underneath his breath.
 
He turned his attention to me and again with a raised voice said “WHY DON’T YOU HAVE ANY MODERN COMPUTERS?” I don’t know what he expected to find when he walked into his store; we are clearly in the business of selling refurbished and last-years models.
 
Staying behind the counter, but we have a few new Sony VAIO models in the back that have not been put on display yet. Do you want to see them?”
 
The VAIO notebooks were the newest models available in Europe. Why and how we had them
 
I decided to ignore this comments as he wasn’t attacking me personally. I unpacked the VAIO and showed him the specifications. This notebook had the best configuration of all the notebooks in the store
 
“You mean a GPU,” I replied in a last ditch effort to get this man to stop complaining and actually work towards finding a fitting computer.
 
“It’s probably too complicated for you,” he replied. It was around now that I started becoming agitated and started to lose my cool. “I handle import, export and distribution for many big companies in Germany. My company is worth millions. Do you understand this?” 

“Yes

“I need to keep important spreadsheets and contracts
 
I told him I felt that this computer would meet his requirements with a wide margin and asked him where he felt it did not. He replied that it doesn’t matter
 
With Don coming in his demeanour changed. Maybe it was because Don was even heavier and bigger and it impressed him. With Don taking over and repeating exactly what I had said
 
When we got at the counter the big important businessman wanted to know about our premium services. While I still think that Ron and Don were intimately familiar with the offerings of premium services
 
As such
 
“I was hoping you’d be a premium service

I had been working at the store now for over a year now and had built up a tough skin. I wasn’t the shy, “How’d you like to pay for your notebook?” What I hadn’t realised with my new found savviness was that I was talking to the important business Gorilla that was worth millions. I just gave him an opening to keep trying.
 
He was quick to react and started talking again about his multi-million company and how he would dominate the export and import for the whole of Europe in just a few years. That I could be there with him was the underlying tone of his story. 
 
I quickly cut him off, and that my comment was a bad attempt at a joke. He did not lie about his persistence. It was very much there. After a few more misplaced comments from him about me I had had enough.
 
“Please stop with this. I don’t believe you are worth millions and honestly no money in the world would make whatever you are fantasizing happen.” His grin changed into a frown. “Stupid girl
 
He ticked me off. I was done being polite.

I started yelling at him, the stitching are wrong, the buttons are wrong.” He was getting angry. “Besides, it’s 3 sizes too big; it’s not even tailored”. 

He slammed his fist on the glass counter and pulled up his sleeve, “I cannot believe that. If your suit is fake, why would your watch be real?”
 
While I might sound cool now
 
By now Don had walked into the store again to hear what the commotion was all about. He saw me and the 400 lb Gorilla shouting at each other. He started calling me all kinds of names; I kept on repeating calling him a fake.
 
Then out of nowhere, or the fact that a seventeen year old kid was insulting him. 

Don dropped what he had in his hands and walked up to the supposed multimillion dollar Gorilla
 
It took well over a couple minutes before any police arrived and pulled them apart. I was scared of what would have happened if Don had lost the fight. They had been all over the store by now

When the police came they arrested both Don and the Gorilla. They took a statement from me

Don seemed to still be a decent human being under all those layers of saturated fat. I was happy Don took responsibility and tried to get him out of the store instead of charging him extra for damaging goods.
 
The businessman was charged with assault

'I don't need a patch panel

Me: 'Ummmm

Me: 'You want *all the sockets* connected in a *ring*?  That won't work.....'

Him: 'I don't see why I should pay for all that extra cable when your dad can just do it in one go!'

Me: 'But the minute you plug more than two devices in nothing will work!'

Him: 'Stop trying to rip me off

Me: '................!'

I advised dad to do it the way the owner wanted but get him to sign a disclaimer to that effect.   Dad spent a couple of weeks doing a complete electrical re-wire and adding the owners new 'ring-main' network topology

Last night I get a call from dad telling me the owner had just called him.  He'd moved in, Xbox, IP security cameras, and networked smart meters in and nothing was working.  He wanted dad to go out and fix it.  At no cost.  Apparently he has 'no memory' of my 'you're doing it wrong' conversation or of signing anything to that effect.  Dad emailed him a copy of the note he'd signed, along with a suitably outrageous quote for putting things right.

I work in a mobile phone repair kiosk in Australia and i usually have customers just coming to get their phones done

because we were fairly busy and i had to wait to use our POS i started talking to OM, but i have always been interested in taking apart electronics to see how they work. we talked for a while and he said ""im 87 years old, the most technological thing we had back in my day was the telephone, i think its good that you know so much about this at a young age"" (im 16) he talked about how he only used the phone for texts and calls and he needed help to use his computer. It was just a very pleasent exchange.

We eventually got the phone restored to factory settings and all his contacts transferred back on and it was ringing again, i set the phone to maximum volume (he had a hearing aid) and gave him the phone back. he asked how much for the help, and i said it was free because i didnt really do much, and it only took like 10 minutes and was a good change from the usual customers, he called me in close and said something that made my day, he said "" if you have a mum, tell her i think your brilliant"" 


he thanked us massively for the help and went on his way and thats how this one old man made my day :).

This week I was returning to South Carolina, the rollout was fucked.  I was contracted to a different consulting firm to help them on the project.  

My chain of command went: Me, Client Manager.  And, I was the only rep on-site from either consulting firm, so I had to deal with all of the angry complaints from the customer on why this project was two months late.

And, the software I was implementing from my firm - it turns out that this customer was one of the first clients that was using certain functions, and I was finding serious bugs in it.  

I was getting nightly builds of the software from our engineering department to resolve the issues.

Finally, and for me to make it, I needed to be on the 2pm flight on Friday.

I was thrilled that the data worked, and that we could run through their live data tomorrow to see how it went.  

I stayed late working on the system documentation

So, just before noon, she comes with the 40 000 page data sample which needs to be parsed.

It turns out that the sample data set I had was NOT representative of the live data set....  Information which was in a fixed field in the sample data was free form text in the report.  The data set was seriously inconsistent with the sample data

The manager then blows up in my face, and how the lawyers will be after my company, etc.  

Like I said

I tried telling her that I would be back on Monday

I interrupt her, here's the number for the VP of professional services.  He'll be happy to listen to you.

As I walk out the door, I have been an excellent employee with no complaints from customers in the past.  I explain what happened, and say that I had needed to leave before I blew up at her.  But, that if he needed me to, I could go somewhere to cool off for a bit and go back.

His response was ""Hell no.  You won't be going back there until you get an apology from her.""  I was told to catch my flight

I spent the next two weeks working at a nice easy gig

I told her that I hadn't ever told my management I didn't want to work there, as he was responsible for my schedule.  I then called VP to let him know she had apologized....

I spent the next week in South Carolina

But it was a strange situation at the end.  I received a thank-you letter from the client for my hard work at the same time they were suing the consulting company they had hired for the project. 

But nothing bad happened to my company from there....

We received a call from a particularly stubborn (and arrogant) software developer from one of our labs. We've always known him to have a particularly foul temper


**SA:** Ops center

**Derpus:** Get off of *[computer name]*? I need it and you won't give me control.


*The valiant SA turns around to look


**SA:** There's no one here working on *[computer name]*.

In my [last post](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/153lv8/oh_thank_heavens_youre_finally_here/) I told the story of an old lady who forgot how to use a key. This story is the tale of a belligerent patron who felt he had to resort to violence... 

In addition to the background I gave in my previous story; We worked 12 hour shifts, including weekends. Friday and Saturday were our busiest days.

I had a service call one Saturday for a single terminal venue whose internal barcode scanner had stopped working. I'd attended this venue previously an knew that a replacement was required. The whole process to change it would take around 5 minutes. The operator (who was a nice lady that we'll call Ms Nice) called out to the customers that the terminal would be down for a few minutes, and thanked us for letting them know. A third man, probably mid-40's (who I will refer to as Mr Angry), just grunted and paid no attention.

Getting the go ahead from Ms Nice, skids to a halt on front of the disassembled terminal and frantically looks for the card slot. After about 5 seconds, the realisation that the terminal is down kicks in, and Mr Angry gets angry...

**Mr Angry:** *points at the disassembled terminal* ""WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS!!??""

The outburst is so loud and sudden

**Me:** Um... Sorry sir

**Mr Angry:** *cutting me off* On a fucking SATURDAY!? You little c*nt! Why the fuck would you pull this bullshit on a Saturday!? (Yes

**Ms Nice:** ""Sir

**Mr Angry:** ""I should be able to place my bets whenever the fuck I want! This is BULLSHIT!!""

He then scrunched up the ticket and threw it at me. It hit me in the face

""You'd better hope it doesn't win."" *Points at me* ""You watch your back! I should take you out to the carpark and fuck you up

Mr Angry then storms off back to the viewing area, smooths it out, reads it, and then places it on the counter next to the terminal. ""Just in case..."" She says.

Another minute passes and I'm almost done reassembling the terminal and Mr Angry make another appearance...

**Mr Angry:** *pointing at me* ""YOU! You cost me over $5000! Because of YOU I missed my bet! You owe me $5000! I had $XXX to win on that winner and- 

**Ms Nice:** *cutting him off* ""ACTUALLY...  "" *She holds up his discarded card* ""You had 50 cents for a place on number Y

The look on Mr Angry's face was absolutely priceless. The kind of dumb, turned, and left the venue. 30 seconds later the terminal was reassembled, tested and working beautifully.

I saw Ms Nice a few more times after that

**TL;DR:** Would you care for a serving of threats with those lies?

I take the call and it is a guy with a very heavy middle eastern accent. We work often with people from that part of the country and have had some great experiences. One of our major clients outsources all there IT needs and we work great with them. I'm excited for this one. 

They guy lets me know he is from ""Mircosoft call center"". Oh ya. Not ""the"" Microsoft call center

he continues to tell me that my computer is seeing a report that there is something wrong with it. I ask him which computer. We have over 100 computers in the building not to mention all the servers. So I ask him if the report to him included a computer name or Ip address. Looks like the report to him only include the information ""Windows 7""

Well if he is so sure I had better let him troubleshoot this for me. So I proceed to let him troubleshoot it. 

""You see the c t r l key on your keyboard?"" he askes.

""yes I see the control key on the keyboard."" I reply

""Yes the ctrl key."" he asks again.

I let him know again I know the key.

Finally he gets that I know which key it is. He then continues

""Yep

""Type I N F and press enter.""

""Got it I have the INF folder up.""

He continues going on tellling me that all those files are responses to the virus that I have and we need to fix it.

I then start to see if he will play. I ask him again how he got my info and what my name was. He was good enough to know my first name from the Admin Assistant that transferred the call to me. But doesn't know my last name. 

I then ask him where he worked. Which again is just ""call center"". I then asked him for some random made up Microsoft reseller partner number. 

Hey then asks me if I am IT. I say yes. His response is classic

I love my job sometimes.

She also had and IRON FIST of authority.  I had found my new god.


Tier Two was the summer of love.  I labored willingly and gleefully under her stern discipline


Then I got the night shift


Night Shift was the best thing ever, I was building legos in the helldesk, and the phone rang. 


""Thank you for calling $Best_ISP


The reply was velvet over shapely hips


""Great


It was also a rather irritated sexy voice.  I hastily assured this unknown user at the other end of my line that I was a trained professional buck


""OK, and my secondary account is Proper_Name, which is of course Proper_Name@Best_ISP.net.   I have two of your biggest DSL connections, and one of them keeps dropping offline.  I'm losing income because I'm unable to reliably upload my videos.  I am a sex cam performer, is that a problem?""

I had been prepared for this.  This was the absolute peak of my career


""No, and both accounts are in good standing.  I do see multiple connections attempts on your secondary account, this is certainly indicative of a problem...""


We troubleshot the problem, she was able to connect..   occasionally.   I chatted with her about webcam technology, and commiserated about finding a device that could autofocus worth a damn - a problem I still have.  The call ended, the account was noted, and I had a smoke before going back to my legos.


But the story doesn't end there. Three days later, but our corporate overlord.  She who's power it is to bind and to loose.  She who gets off at 5pm - 2 hours ago.


Oh.   Oh balls.


With every minor misdeed and excursion outside the rules playing in my head


Instead of that, and a strong personal kudo from the boss (and she bribed in chocolate - hell yes.).

Tuesday (one week prior): Level 1 receives a call about a tablet that is acting funny and keeps re-directing the web pages to other 'not appropriate' sites. We assume some malware and clean it up remotely. Problem solved.

Wednesday: No calls from that location

Thursday: The Malware is back with a vengeance (on that tablet only, but the web filter is going crazy with alerts all over the screen saying ~~'No! Bad end-user!~~ Page Blocked due to Content. Please contact your administrator.'

Everyone is aware of the web filter and that it is tracked by IT. However, I checked the filter logs from the day before. I was ready to see some 'not appropriate' sites in the log and was not let down.

As policy states

Friday: I watch the logs and find the user. To ensure the evidence was concrete, I made sure to include the print screens I took to see if she could make that face once more. She could. 

Monday: HR decides we are flying to that location to 'discuss' this activity with the employee and their supervisor. :: wait for it to register:: 'we?'  Yep! Tomorrow morning. 9am. Conference room at that location. Please bring all collected documentation to be shown as evidence.

Tuesday: D-Day. 9 am meeting begins. Clearly, Ma’am.”

In the end he was terminated without any protest. His only justification being that he mainly used the tablet in the bathrooms. I handed him a copy of the printscreen to ensure he had it for his records. I’m trying to not crack a smile as the immature child in me is going [omgomgomgomg! Hahaha!]

We are currently sitting in a coffee place killing time before we fly back. The HR lady turned to me and said ‘I never really appreciated IT until now.

I've been with my company for a long time now

In the end shuffle of all that re-organization I wound up in the server support team for Europe

The new guy is only supposed to handle local desktop support since all of the server stuff has been centralized

He tries escalating it to us but nobody can remote into any of the IPs he gives us.  After a frustrating day of trying to handle things remotely my boss puts out the call to see who can make it to Turkey quickest.  I'm in Frankfurt which is a major hub for air travel in Europe

Okay, and a virtual host server with a DC running on it, SMS and another file server.  Every one of these servers has melted components inside.  I'm not using ""melted"" as a euphemism for broken.  They are physically melted and worthless.

I do what any one of you would do and start looking around for the tape drive.... but there isn't one.  So.... new guy...  where's the backup?

He runs off and asks the people who work in the office if they know anything about the backup and comes back with a hand full of DVDs

Some of you are probably thinking exactly what I thought.  ""This sucks

We got new hardware in and working air conditioning and kicked off a project to have a proper server room put in for them.  But 18 months of work was irretrievably gone for an office of around two dozen people.

A couple weeks later I can remember sitting in a meeting with my bosses boss and the business lead for Turkey with both of them yelling back and forth.

The CFO goes ahead and approves all of the orders, and so do all of the VPs, with the exception of the nightlife VP (this guy is kind of a prick).  Anyways, I go ahead and place the orders for all of the laptops except for the nightlife ones. 


A few weeks later I get an email from the VP of nightlife saying that his laptop crashed.  I go through some general diagnostics with him and eventually I tell him to bring it in and I would back up his hard drive and re-image it.  


Then the following dialogue takes place:


Me:  “The reimaging process takes about three hours and seeing as it's already pretty late in the day


VP:  “That is unacceptable. There is an event tonight at [insert nightclub name here] and I need a laptop tonight.  What about one of those?” He points to the bin on my desk labeled


Me:  “Well unfortunately those laptops are reserved for other departments and there are no spare laptops allocated for the nightlife department.”


He then starts cursing at me and telling me that I need to a better job of fairly allocating technology.  I kindly remind him that I tried to order five spare laptops for his department earlier that month and he was the one who denied the purchase order.  He starts yelling again saying that he's a VP and he should be able to just borrow one of the corporate laptops for the night.  I explain to him that I can't just give out laptops to people in one department if they came out of another department's budget and that I could potentially lose my job by doing so.

Now Read On...

So we had this Netware network running Windows 3.11 and Win95 workstations over BNC-connected Token Ring, and the logon and logoff processes including the copying of these files down to the workstation on logon and back up to the user home drive on logoff.  

The problem arose because, that's right, there was nothing in the INI-copying function which first removed existing INI files from the destination. (Partially valid as there were half a dozen ones vital for the running of the workstation, but even so.)  

The result? User A would log on to a PC. Their INI files would download to that PC. They'd log off, where both sets of INI files would copy down to the workstation, and when they logged off, they might pick up INI files from users C, D, and E who'd been using it before - not to mention that the workstation now had INI files from C, D, B, and H in the following week.  

So while a new user to the department might have ten or so INI files which belonged to them, mostly because staff tended to install (against the AUP) lots of little shareware games which used them. Logging on and off now took thirty minutes or more as the machine tried to copy thousands of these things over the ageing network, particularly during as almost everyone in the multiple buildings had the same schedule and so arrived and left work at the same time.
   
  
On top of this, and it would not be overwritten, but instead would copy up to a user's home drive on logoff. If a user logged on to a PC with one or more of these, and the wrong interface settings came up, their first instinct was usually to log off and log back on, and then try another PC - meaning that the read-only INI files were now not only on the original PC, but on the user's home drive and the second PC, as they could be exterminated again and again by the Helpdesk but would keep popping up as long as there was a single copy anywhere on the network. It didn't help that the executives tended to fly around the country a lot and log onto random PCs in our other city offices

Something had to be done. However

I sat down with a copy of *Perl for Dummies* and wrote a script called Buffy.  
   
  
I built Buffy to kill vampires. It was designed to patrol the network servers at night, pull the guts out of the necessary ones and rewrite them, remove the read-only attribute from whatever was left, and generally act as guardian of user settings, preventer of the spread of vampirism on the network, and all-around watchdog.  

It was three-quarters documentation and comments, checked that any changes it made conformed to correctness, restored from backups if something had gone wrong, and was generally hyper-conservative in its work. I tested it on some test accounts, using horrible messes of INI files copied from live users, and it worked perfectly. All it needed was access to the servers, which I (being a low-level peon) did not have. This is *why* I had written all the documentation and use notes

I had written Buffy in spare moments gleaned from the unrelenting waterfall of incoming tickets, stay back late and run regexes. It was my very first Perl script of any length, and a labor of love. I worked on it for weeks, polished it until it shone, and then went cap-in-hand to the Level 3 team.  

""Guys, and with INI files being read-only and copying themselves around the network. I know it's causing problems with service levels and the ability of staff to do their jobs. I have here a script, with full and complete documentation, which I think might be able to help. Would you have a look at it?""  

And the Level 3 team said:  
   
  
""No.""  
   
  
And that was the end of Buffy.

Not quite one for imagining the devil raising from his throne to cause some havoc in a little shared drive... but more that the devil himself was real.

At first I just guessed that her assumption that **LORD SATAN** had infiltrated her folders on the network was her way of describing that she had lost some files, was fairly vivid. She had entered her shared folder looking for a certain file, and could only describe her *terror* as she found **EL DIABLOS** staring back at her, right there.

Naturally; she immediately closed the folder (to protect everyone, to report the infiltration of the lord of the underworld.

Everything was working, and when I leave he is happy and I am feeling good that I helped him out and got it back to him quickly.

The store was still doing well with selling Chinese knockoff items

The atmosphere in the store was still bad 2 months after the store outing and mainly the tension between Jeremy and Don and Ron was at an all time high. Jeremy who could be so indifferent at times now had strong opinions whenever it concerned me.

He did not really like the store all that much anymore. He had never really had to much of a problem with it

I had seen Ron and Don during the week interviewing a lot of new people

It took another full two weeks before we had another team meeting. I was getting sick of these things. Aside from the usual folks we now had two new people: Marcel and Johan.  

“These are our two new employees to make sure that the store is staffed while you guys are out on the road

“Excuse me?” was the first thing Jeremy shouted. “What is this about!?”

“Well

“So this will mean that most of the time Jeremy

They quickly ended the meeting and said goodbye as if we weren’t allowed to even say anything about it. I now had Marcel and Johan looking at me. I grabbed Jeremy’s hand and left quickly; I was not going to deal with them too.

* * *

When Jeremy went to the store the next morning he had gotten a bike from Ron with the stores logo printed on the crate in front of it. “It’s healthy for you, so you better hurry.” He put a list of all the addresses in his hand and closed the store door.

Jeremy didn’t like going to other people’s houses to fix their problems. He was happy fixing their computers, as they are all electronics anyway.

Pricing for the service was premium to say the least. Easily 2 times more expensive than bringing the computer to the store. However

* * *

Meanwhile, but their resumes were rather empty when asked about them. Work experiences were few and far between, it seemed to me. It wasn’t too hard to figure out why this was; they were hard to get along with. 

Johan and Marcel tended to know it all better. They weren’t stupid

My shift with them was rather strange. I knew just about everything about the store: how to work the systems

A customer came into the store while I was explaining to them how the register worked. It was a customer I knew

He had invited me once to his house to see his collection of computers and it was simply amazing. He had been working in computers all his life and had designed circuit boards for many systems throughout the years. He had taken the time to explain to me how the systems worked and how complex they could be. If I had to give my reasons as to why I am a hardware designer these days he would be on the list. 

When he saw me in the store, get the chance, as Johan and Marcel were fighting each other as to who was going to help this old man find a new computer. He was overwhelmed at first by the insistence and aggressiveness of them both, but quickly recovered.

“I only want to be helped by Leila as she has helped me countless times before. Please go do something else instead of harassing me

After that shift I started working less at the store

* * *

Meanwhile Richard and Frank were having the time of their lives going to their customers together. They had convinced Ron to let them handle all the appointments and scheduled them to their benefits

You could tell they had even more fun browsing around people’s computers and finding out what dark parts of the internet they visited when they were actually with the persons in their house. Getting free drinks and food from the people wasn’t too bad either.

Jeremy

The customer had the vague problem that his computer didn’t work. He never gave any specifics about it, and the screen had what looked like a couple of bruises. 

Jeremy tried to talk with the customer as to what was wrong with the computer, Jeremy went to work and tried to start the computer. It didn’t work. When he checked the cabling he found that the power cable had been completely torn apart. He replaced the cable and tried again. The computer turned on.

Hearing the startup chime from Windows

When Jeremy tried to calm the man down

If it wasn’t for Richard and Frank, and no-one was the wiser.

The scheme had been working brilliantly for some weeks and Ron and Don did not know anything about it. That was until they got greedy. They had been called by a old couple that had trouble with their TV’s set-top box. Given they could earn a quick buck and the problem would not be difficult to fix

When they were at the old couple's home

They charged 75 euros. The couple paid. Two weeks later the couple had the same problem and they charged 75 euros again. It was now that the couple’s son found out about this and went ballistic in the store at Don. 

Don didn’t know anything about it and called Frank and Richard. They tried to keep the situation under control but the sixth sense of Don must have picked up on the missing money. They were forced to show their secret agenda and it was now Ron who went ballistic.

Frank and Richard were fired

1372045175.0,1gy4bx,Ancient DOS version of Word Perfect saves the day,sezzme,617,113,106,"(EDIT: dang

-------------

This dates back from back in the days before Pagemaker gave way to Adobe InDesign.  

So there I was, cell, whatever the heck you call it.  This was a lot of text in very small type.

What they wanted seemed simple: change some various bits of text in certain cells and send it off for printing.  Copy a block of text from one column and replace the existing text in another column.  Seemed easy enough...

Not quite.  Whoever originally created this graphic file had decided that the best way to format the text was to type something in a cell, rinse and repeat.

This text was not in column format to start with. So when I tried to change or cut the text

What we needed was to convert this word salad into pretty much one looooong column.  Then I could easily format it back into proper multiple columns in Pagemaker.

After pasting the text into whatever word processing program I had at the time

I called my boss over to look at it and tell him the bad news.  After some discussion he was about to break the news to the client when I had a brainwave and told him to come back in a couple of hours.

I immediately called a fellow geek and said:  ""Email me a copy of Word Perfect 5.0 NOW.   I'll explain later.""

I used to create newsletters in Word Perfect 5.0 back in the day.  One thing I loved was the macros...  you could do some pretty neat

Too many years have gone by for me to remember the exact macro sequences I created to accomplish what happened next.  All I know was that I started by having it change the damn spaces to some obscure character

I showed the boss what I did.  It blew his mind.  He praised me in an employee meeting later that week.

Some experienced coder later told me:  ""Sezzme

TL;DR:  Desktop publishing environment.  Dragged Word Perfect 5.0 back from the dead to reformat a bunch of badly-formatted text into a sweet, changing 8 hours of work into 45 minutes.   Took advantage of macro capability that only this ancient DOS version of WP had, as far as I knew.   Got compliments from the boss.  Some coder later told me I should be a programmer.

1345907770.0,yt3gl,Fix it for me or I'll get you fired.,munky9001,676,168,115,"This is from my first ever IT job. I got a job for a small ISP as a linux and network admin. I found routing problems(not fix)

Well back story is that there was this one customer who spent loads of money and was constantly spending more and more. They had 5 mlppp internet connections(used at most like 1 dsl connection) and other services we were selling and they were in line to buy our future products. They 'needed' basically none of it. The part however is that the IT person at this place was a 10 and she always got her way. She also had a very large budget but she didn't have the first clue about what to do in her job; however everyone bent over backwards for her because she was very flirty and hot.

So I get a call from her saying 'no emails are being sent out' and i check postqueue I see nothing stuck. I check mail.log and grep for their domain. I tell her, I can see past emails from lots of other businesses. I never see a single attempt from anyone at this applicable place.

So I basically drew the line. I said that their mail server isn't my responsibility and I'm much too busy to do a back and forth with her. That their exchange server must have some block or their antispam is blocking it or smtp connector is pointed the wrong way. I didn't know what was wrong but it was certainly not at my end. She counters, 'Well we don't have an SLA with you and nothing is actually down that we are responsible for so there's really no point in threatening a lawsuit. Plus the only way I could fix this would be to connect to your server and fix it'

She liked that answer, 'Well I was just on there changing settings and then it stopped working' I just stayed silent for a good minute and she would say, 'are you still there?' and I would just say, 'yep' and after about a minute of basically silence she's like, 'so have you finished thinking about how to fix it?' and I'm like, 'No I was just waiting for your words to sink into your own head. You did something and now it doesn't work... just undo what you did.'

She was angry again, ""would you like me to give you my boss' phone number?"" now of note here, my boss absolutely hated when we gave his # to customers, because he would chill at home doing nothing and would only have to work when a customer called him and he'd be extremely mad that we gave his # out. However in this case I already knew she had it and that's exactly what she said.

Then I basically was like, ""Sorry but this isn't going to happen, if you want I can tell you some phone numbers for some local IT businesses that could help you out."" You could hear her typing angrily and she's like, 'I've already racked up $30,000 in bills this month from IT businesses in the city. That's why I need you to fix it before my boss finds out and questions what's going on.' I'm was taken aback by that number and say nothing.

I think she was starting to realize wtf was going on

I never did hear from her again as I quit that job not that long afterwards but my next job after that I had heard about how she would get them to do work and then she'd have another IT place go in find any problems and use those problems to not pay for the other. The IT places started to clue in and play hardball right back.

I'm the Computer technician for a school district. One of my duties at our elementary school is to ration out ink cartridges because it is believed that elementary teachers act as the students they are responsible for. For budgetary reasons and the fact that I work for a school that is budget conscious and likes to ""save money"" by freezing the budget come December. So I use to order about $3k in ink supplies for the inkjet printers and about another $2k in Toner supplies in September in anticipation for the school year. Or at least that is how it was until I went to lunch one day and didn't lock my office. I came back to find my entire cache of HP 27 and HP 28 ink cartridges

SO in retaliation I assumed it was one of our employees with a printer that used HP27/28 ink (hoping it wasn't just someone looking to sell them on eBay, HP 27/28 Ink. 8 results... I waited until that evening when it was just me and the custodial staff. I then went from room to room as I have a master key checking desks of the teachers on my list. 7 of the 8 had 4 or more cartridges that I could find in assorted places from desks to closets to cabinets. During my late night raid I collected 43 cartridges leaving only 4 behind for each teacher, 2xHP27 and 2xHP28.

Then next morning I then reported to management what I had done and the number of cartridges that I had confiscated, meanwhile they are just storing them for a rainy day.

I now have a locked closet away from my office to store the supplies in...

Oh yea and I also shot out and email tanking everyone for returning their additional ink cartridges. I have since cut my ink expenditures 25% as the dated ink was still good and I used the surplus to offset expenditures.

Over the ext month I had several faculty members come to me and report that someone had stolen their ink cartridges…

I never disclosed to the district what faculty members it was that I recovered the cartridges from

The woman is clearing experiencing the later of my theories. I manage to get her details. Enough that I can work with anyway. And I find out that the modem is showing a red internet. DSL and sync shows solid signal. Modem probably just needs a reset to kick start the connection. 

I check details on the model of modem. That it's one of ours without any custom settings as far as she's aware. I check previous logs

""That's perfect. Now, maybe a paperclip or pin and what I want you to do is to push it into that hole and hold it in. The modem will reset in about 10 seconds.""

Me: ""Do you need me to go over it step by step with you?""

Cust: ""No

There's about a minute of silence then. I'm assuming she went off to find a pin or something small. But then comes the grunting. Now

Me: ""Hello? Can you hear me?""

I can hear the grunting in the background and if I wasn't worried before I'm worried now because it's being accompanied by a fairly noisy banging.

I'm calling out on the phone hoping that she can hear me and that she comes back. So far my brain is running away with itself and I'm now theorizing that she's actually giving birth to a robot.

As I'm sitting there with a confused and slightly scared look on my face I hear a male voice in the background. There is some raised voices and then some laughter.

The laughter made me feel a little better. But only a bit.

I'm sitting at my desk, but there's a queue building and I want to wrap this one up quick.

After a few minutes of this back-and-forth nonsense I manage to pry out of him that his air conditioner outside is running

This is a fairly common issue that people call us for. Their compressor outside is running but the air isn't being cooled, only thermostats.

I calmly explain this to the customer(he's getting progressively more upset)

-""Well sir

-""Then how do you know?!"" ""I want to speak to a TECHNICAL PERSON!""

Now here's the kicker: The thermostat he has installed is a model that we no longer service

-""Unfortunately I won't be able to put you into contact with one of our technicians

-""You installed it i want it fixed! yadda yadda""(This continues for a few minutes of him ranting)

-""As much as I'd like to help you

I work for a large university, my department does not charge other subdepartments in our division. They have our support for free.


Enter today's story.


A DBA from our catacombs sends a request to check why his monitor isnt working. Fair enough. We check it out, so lets just RMA the part and next day mail will have him up and running in no time. In the meantime, we managed to setup a work around where the machine is plugged into the onboard card, so he can at least function.


Next day, but he made up his mind. Sure Not a problem.


Fast forward a week, he caves and says, Ok fine, lets do it now....


Then goes right back to work.


So i stand there like an idiot for a minute or so. Two minutes. 5 minutes. I used to be a DBA


10 minutes pass and played a few games of candy crush


Awesome. ""Excuse me sir

User- ""I've been ready

""Well sir

User- ""You mean i have to move?""


This is not the worst part...


I calmly explain that it would be very difficult for me to open his computer and replace a faulty part while he occupies the space around it.


user- ""Fine

Great

user- ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING???? ARE YOU RETARDED??""""""


So i have this thing about namecalling people trying to help you. Don't do it. Just don't. It makes you look unprofessional

""Sir

User- ""You're closing all my stuff!"" Who told you to do that""

Lightbulb

""Sir

User-"" You're job is to replace the part. Not ruin my work.""

""Well

User-"" YOU MEAN YOU HAVE TO SHUT DOWN? WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?""


Yep. A DBA


""I'm gonna come back in 5 minutes. You should take these 5 minutes to save your files


5 minutes later, he's on the phone with my Boss.


K. Here's your part. Left it on the desk and walked away. Went back to the office. My boss walks in after a few minutes and grills me on the story. I repeat this to him almost verbatim


Boss- ""Well wheres the part now?""

""I left it with him""

Boss-""But....""

The biggest mistake I ever made was giving my grandparents an old XP machine. I can't count the times I've tried to explain how the Windows OS (or any OS for that matter) works, I get the call one day and head over there after getting off work.

As soon as I walk in the door John excitedly pulls his lazy ass up off the couch and starts walking side by side with me towards the computer room

""I performed a thorough search of the computer and didn't find any viruses

So I sit down at the computer desk with him hovering over me. The shitbag you were just introduced to is my forty-something year old drug addict (using the term 'drug addict' really isn't fair to real addicts, he felt the way to fix it was to install 6 anti viruses, 5 pop-up blockers, and 3 malware solutions. Not just install them (and use a pretty bit of my grandparents money buying the useless shit), but set them up so they are all running at the same time. I sat with my head in my hands for a good five minutes staring in quiet awe at his masterpiece. It took me all of thirty seconds to wipe the undeserved, shit eating grin right off his face.

""You guys still only have one user account right?"" I asked my grandma

""Wait why?"" John gasped in a disheartened tone.

""Because you know way less about computers than they do but are twice as dangerous because you think you know what you're doing. You have created a ton of work that I now have to do

""But if you undo what I did the viruses are going to come back!"" he said

""Never in the history of computation have Craigslist and Pier 21 (the only to sites my grandparents ever visit) loaded viruses on a machine

Ron had quit his job as IT-administrator at my school to work full time in the store again. After the incidents with Frank &amp; Richard and later on with Johan and Marcel they decided to not hire new personnel for a while. They had told Jeremy and me that they would both work full time at the store again to restore to its former glory. Richard

They would start working in the store again on saturday morning

I checked the back expecting - maybe even wanting - to find a wasteland of computer parts and casings. Nothing. Everything was normal. And it stayed normal. Ron &amp; Don had been successful in making the store less horrible. My guess was that they were too busy keeping the store running and could not focus on ludicrous business plans and other ideas. It was actually kinda nice.

After a few weeks Ron &amp; Don had decided not to work the evenings and weekends anymore and decided to hire someone new. Sales had recovered enough for them to be able to pay for another employee. They had told both Jeremy and me about this during a rather silent - but still infamous - team meeting. Both of us knew the other one was afraid of getting another Marcel or Johan aboard

It was silent for another two weeks and we both hoped that Ron &amp; Don were simply having a hard time getting someone new. Something in me did hope that we got someone even worse than Marcel and Johan to push Jeremy to pursue new things. I was pushing him to start looking for other opportunities. I did not wanted to get married to someone that still worked for Ron and Don a few years down the road. He could be anything he wanted

I was surprised when Jeremy send me a text on friday that the new employee would start next Saturday on a shift with me. I did not want that. why was it always me that had to help get the new employees get started? What kind of troublesome person would it be now? I didn’t want to go to work and delayed going to the store as long as possible that saturday morning.

I had to get to the store at around 8:45 to disable the alarm

She waited patiently at the cash register till I was done with the basic tasks needed to get the store in working order. “How can I help you” I said to her. “Well I am supposed to start today to work at this store.” She paused for a second “I think you must be Leila

There were only two things I could think after that; “why did I act like that to her?” and even more pressing  “what did Ron tell her about me”.

* * *

The new girl was named Sarah and was she was about my size and posture with only a year difference between the two of us. Her face was full of freckles and hidden half of the time behind bright orange hair.  There was a feel over her of being calm and easy going. Simply said; Sarah was as awesome as me.

Despite the rather rough start on my part we started liking and learning each other more and more during the shift. I started out by explaining how the store worked and the strange customers we tend to get. She simply said “I know and I don’t mind” I started at her “I can handle it”. She seemed strong but she did to my knowledge didn’t have any experience yet. I was afraid that she was overestimating herself.

She had applied for the job to get some more experience on repairing computers and dealing with non computer literate folks. Like me she wanted to have a professional career involving computers

She was a quick learner and before the morning was over had learned most of what there was to learn about the store. She had not dealt with customers yet

It all went rather well for the first few hours and she helped quite a few customers to find what they were looking for and processed a number of returns and repairs. Not being accustomed to the working day Sarah was quite tired by now but she was still working

Sarah and I had been working together for about six weeks and had become good friends. Working in the store was fun

* * *

It was a Saturday when Sarah and I worked in the store. I had seen her deal with customers before and she handled the awkward and uncomfortable situations quite well. She had dealt with a man that was a couple years older than us in her second week. He tried to look like a 50s playboy but had failed miserably.  What he did pin down correctly was the blind arrogance that made him believe he was God’s gift to woman. I had seen him before. He had tried his “moves” on me months ago.

I let Sara deal with it to see how she would react. I did stay close to her. I’d rather have anything strange happen under my watch and be able to intervene than at any other point in time.

The man had been browsing through the store for a while before Sarah got around to helping him. While most customers were either angry for not being helped within the second of entering the store or angry with the fact that they were being helped he was acting normal. He started by asking her about notebooks on display and what the specifications were all about.

After a couple of minutes of pretending to ask questions and looking into her bra he started moving in. He started talking smoothly“I don’t care about the numbers on that computers, her face turning into disgust “ I like my digits low.” He continued with a smile.

Sarah looked at him and said “Too bad my phone number is 10 digits long then” she continued to look at him seriously and after a while said “get out of the store”. He walked out of the store. I was laughing out loud. I didn’t know whether Sarah misunderstood he was asking for her age

Or so I wished. It went really well working with Sarah and the customers seemed to behave more and more as the weeks went by. Because of everything I was letting my guard down

It was Saturday evening and we still had about 2 hours on the clock before the store was about to close. We never got many customers around that time

She had helped a few customers this evening but it was otherwise silent in the store. The bell rang as a new customer had entered the store. It was a skinny male around his 30s or something. He wore old and torn clothing and a baseball cap. He smelled weird but nothing recognisable for us. Nothing out of the ordinary in this store though. 

He looked around and started walking to the notebooks and typing on the keyboards. Sarah walked over and went to see if she could help him. He was now acting rather strangely toward Sarah and muttering under his breath. From where I was sitting in the back I had a clear view of the store and didn’t trust the situation

As I stood up to walk to her it happened. In a split second he pushed her to the ground and shouted at top of his lungs “VERGEWALTIGEN”

In my reaction I ran towards her and grabbed the first thing I could get my hands on. I started hitting him as hard as I could on the back of his head and back. I kept on hitting him until he started bleeding. He stood up and tried to lunge at me but I hit him full in the face causing him to fall to the ground again. He now stumbled to the door and slammed it open while running into the darkness.

I immediately turned my attention to Sarah again who was crying on the floor. I grabbed the phone from the counter and went to sit beside her

It wasn’t until the police had arrived that I payed attention to anything else than Sarah. I saw a notebook lying on the floor

Sarah was being helped by a female police officer and seemed to do better by now. I called Jeremy to come to the store

Sarah was brought home by the police. I was glad the police was there to tell her parents. I didn’t know how to tell her parents what had happened. I stayed by Sarah’s side all night. She didn’t sleep. Neither did I.

The guy who had done this to her turned out to be a drug addict who after a bad trip had been on a rampage trough town going from store to store. He had tried to do the same to another woman on the street. He was arrested two weeks later and sentenced to nine months in prison. 

As for Sarah

1366212331.0,1cjc0g,Spell Check is a Team Sport,ePants,556,63,82,"It's not uncommon for me to see tales here that begin with, but the user is one that is leagues beyond any other I've encountered in terms of sheer ignorant willpower. And yes

To begin with

My supervisor, he's taken more notice of the fact that I'm the only remotely computer savvy person in our office and has developed the endearing habit of calling me into his office virtually every time he has to send an email. Now, this is a man who has been doing his job and using the same systems for a decade and a half before before I even enlisted. Yet, now he's become dependent on me as his walking grammar and spell checker. For the record, I have taught him to use the spell check feature many times, and I've seen him use it successfully on his own, so I don't understand the fixation. 

This particular story is from a couple weeks ago. When he yelled for me from across the office I didn't expect anything out of the ordinary

This time it wasn't just an email he wanted help with. He had to type up the text for an award, simply using one phrase instead of another or not meeting the exact length specifications can potentially change what type of award it is (it could downgrade from a medal to a ribbon, or to just a certificate with no actual award device - or vice versa). 

So I sat there, hunt-and-peck death march. Even as long as this tale is, keep in mind that I'm only going to be walking you through roughly the last 15-20 minutes, and know that I'm not too proud to accept your pity. 

Back to the award. The text on his template was all uppercase. At random points throughout the process he would press the caps lock and then just hold down the shift key - but not entirely consistently - for the next few words

After the last sentence or two was finally completed, he still questions my spelling corrections and insists several of the words are already correct. Trying to control the twitching in my eye, I just stare at the little red squiggly underlines below the words on the screen. 

*Oh*

I've learned not to press these little disagreements too hard, so it isn't going bother me any if he looks like an idiot to the Colonel who has to approve it. 

Surprisingly, lemme take a look,"" and abruptly shifted in his chair, almost bracing himself, like the way a nervous child would prepare for the drop as the roller coaster edges past the peak of the first big hill. 

I should have braced myself for the impending adventure as well. I sat in agape amazement as I watched the events unfold before me. 

Bear with me and try to put yourself in his shoes now

Let's pretend you have the low-end of marginal intelligence

And so

&gt;**Step 1:** Highlight the entire template. (None of that Ctrl+A business though. Click and Drag across the whole document.)
&gt;**Step 2:** Change the text Case to all lowercase using the button on the main ribbon. 
&gt;**Step 3:** Hit the Function key and then manually navigate through the menu to Copy. 
&gt;**Step 4:** Open Outlook. 
&gt;**Step 5**: Go back to Word
&gt;**Step 6:** Open a new email in Outlook and quietly say
&gt;**Step 7:** Right-Click in the body and 'Paste'.
&gt;**Step 8:** Ignore the red squiggly spell check underlines in the email body. 
&gt;**Step 9:** Click the Spell Check button
&gt;**Step 10:** Suddenly notice the red squiggly lines and grunt in disapproval. 
&gt;**Step 11:** Manually fix some of the misspelled words by completely deleting them and retyping them
&gt;**Step 12:** Forget everything you know about Copy and Paste because next you're going to...
&gt;**Step 13:** *Go back to* Word *and manually fix all those same words.* 
&gt;**Step 14:** Close Outlook - not just the new email; close the application entirely. 
&gt;**Step 15:** Curse again. (Just because. Maybe your desktop wallpaper startled you? I don't know.) 
&gt;**Step 16:** Highlight the entire template in Word. 
&gt;**Step 17:** Right-Click. ...And Paste. 

...

Yep. That's right. Nothing else was ever copied. 

You paste over all the corrections with the originally copied spelling mistakes. 

But you don't notice
...

&gt;**Step 18:** Change the type Case back to all upper case. 
&gt;**Step 19:** Save and Close the document. 
&gt;**Step 20**: Open Outlook again. 
&gt;**Step 21:** Minimize and then Restore the 'Outlook' window. Do that *twice*. (Because it was so fun the first time
&gt;**Step 22:** Spend five minutes typing random words into the Search bar to find an email that was the second most recently received email in the inbox and *was already in the preview pane to start with*. 
&gt;**Step 23:** Hit Reply All. (Never mind the fact that the template was sent to a distribution list and only needs to be sent back to the original sender.)
&gt;**Step 24:** Attach the spelling-mistake-riddled Word document via drag-and-drop. 
&gt;**Step 25:** Stare blankly at the screen for approximately 20 seconds while grunting with each exhale.
&gt;**Step 26:** Attach the document to the email again via the Attach button. (Because, *two* is better?) 
&gt;**Step 27:** Type a two-line email and insert a comma after every fourth word. (Because grammar must be ruled with an *iron fist*)
&gt;**Step 28:** Add several more people to the CC line who are in *no way involved*.
&gt;**Step 29:** Hit Send. 
&gt;**Step 30:** Smugly smirk with contentment as you revel in the victory of another slain email

So, I was good with macs in high school, and I got hired to teach the other ITC how to administrate macs and fix most issues.

Anyway

All of the computers were fine.

Keyboards and mice were working fine, he told me that all of the computers weren’t working, I went in after school and took a look.

Every thing was fine, and started testing things on it. All of the USB ports worked, cables weren’t frayed, etc.

Then I noticed that wifi was on. This was odd since I had set it so that you needed administrative rights to turn wifi on. I tried logging in as root (root password never changed I had to change the administrative password every month) and I got back the most confusing error. It said the password was wrong.

I tried it a few more times and asked my boss if he had changed it.

Nope.

So I logged into my account and checked it out. I changed the root password back to the old one and went back to the classroom. Sure enough

The next day

Since I really wanted to figure out what was going on, a student, lets call him Dave, walked into my office, sat down in the chair next to my desk and pulled out his laptop.

I asked him flat out

His response, and I’m going to show you exactly how I did it, two more ways to do it, and how you can fix it.”

At that point, “I heard you say that you were going to send the computers in for repair. I didn’t want to cause you that much of a headache and this was getting boring anyway.”

I told him okay. He pulled out his laptop

The next puzzle is why the root password was changed. I asked him about it and said nothing, he showed me the way he did it and two other ways to do it, all of which could be done in under 90 seconds. (The methods he used are openly available and can be found with a little bit of google, so I’m not going to post them here. If you really want to know, send me a message.)

I was so impressed that he could do this the I bought him lunch in exchange for him telling me everything else he could do and him agreeing not to change the passwords again and not to tell any of the other students about this. Over lunch

TL;DR: Defaults are evil

I get a call from a very angry DSL customer.  His internet wasn't working and our tech was out to his home and everything tested fine to his NID outside.  To TS further, but we repair in the name of customer service whenever possible.    The customer was pissed and uncooperative and wasn't ""available"" nor could he get someone to ""be there"" during our work hours for 3 weeks.  Our work hours are from 8 to 8 M-F.

I'm getting his call a few days before his scheduled appointment to ""MAKE SURE WE DID NOT SCREW UP SO THE TECH DOESN'T COME.""  I confirm that indeed he has an active appointment for the day and time range.  Then he starts ranting about how horrible my company is.  So I let him rant.  Somewhere in the middle of the rant

During his prior call, right? This isn't good enough for the guy so the tech support person sends this guy over to a consumer specialist.  These people get calls when 1) customers are pissed and 2) customers want to disconnect service.  There job is basically keep the customer.  They will do what it takes to not disconnect the customer's service.  They are experienced employees.  They can handle angry customers and they understand how our services work.  So I assume that CS put the customer's account on ""vacation"" which is pretty normal.  This is the only way to place an account ""on hold"" without disconnecting it.  The cost is like $5 and the CS usually waives any fees associated with placing them on vacation.  The customer then would be credited the $5 when the service is fixed.  No problem, right?

Wrong!  I look at our customer/billing program.  I wanted to see if the customer's account needed to be taken off ""vacation"".  You can't troubleshoot a line that is on vacation

So the only way this happened is (a) the customer demanded that his account be disconnected so he did not have to pay the $5 fee

So I explain to the guy he no longer has a DSL account and no connection to troubleshoot.  After he rants for another 10 minutes demanding that his service be working on Monday

At the time, tons of good clients who I loved to work with (and not just because they'd spend money on what needed to be done). This call? It wasn't in that area at all.

It was in south Houston.

Now, Houston is a... special... city. There is no zoning law; residential and commercial buildings are mixed pell-mell together to create a vast concrete wasteland not entirely unlike a session of SimCity 2000 on hallucinogens. In this case, the target house was down the road - about a mile and a half as the admin flies - from a landfill.

One of my coworkers, and it wasn't the first time, either. 

So he drove to the site; he went from the nice, indeed), the denizens seemed to be making the best of it; most kept their lawns well-mowed but not manicured, trash was kept orderly, and the area was, in general, fairly quiet.

He drove down the target's street

His exact words to me later were - and I remember them verbatim to this day - ""it was like the neighborhood had the Smurf theme song going while I was driving through it. And then I got to the house where everything just seemed to darken and light itself was sucked in as if there was no escape. Then I passed it up

He checked the numbers on the curb

He parked a house down, as SOP required, and wept with joy when no one came to the door. The man, normally so stalwart, fled as though all the hounds of hell were at his heels, and entered notes to the effect that ""client didn't answer door, reschedule"" in the scheduling system.

Sure enough, West University, and Memorial, and went to the land of Mordor - I mean, South Houston.

I pulled up to the client's house, making sure my newly-acquired badge (a mark of honor among the field agents) was on my left hip as per uniform SOP. I exited the vehicle, badge on belt, and walked past a green Oldsmobile parked on the curb in front of the house. There were four big men in there, smoking something that definitely wasn't tobacco - tobacco doesn't have a harsh, glassy ""I'M GOING TO MELT YOUR SYNAPSES"" smell - and got deathglares when they saw my badge.

It was at this point I started to think that maybe I PROBABLY shouldn't be here.

I cross the toy-and-trash-strewn lawn, I make it to the front door, gaining 300XP from just passing all my rolls to avoid debris, and knock twice loudly.

The foul stench of a thousand unwashed, as what appeared to be an African-American vertically-inclined version of Jabba the Hutt grunted ""You the repairman?"" at me. When I nodded my affirmative, he beckoned, and oozed his way down the hallway, grunting and huffing with each ponderous step, his back-boobs hanging out of his sweat-and-Xenu-knows-what-stained tank top.

I made it through the hallway, we reached what was once a garage, but had somehow been converted into what only vaguely resembled a bedroom (in the sense that Windows Vista resembles a modern, functioning, properly-designed OS). There was a massive television mounted on the back wall, above a desk where a CRT monitor sat upon its pedestal. There were two boxes sitting next to it, each marked with our service center's logos, I started to feel serious regrets about not calling in sick that day.

I opened the boxes and found a power supply and motherboard. _OH HELL NO

I take the Compaq Presario (black plastic and metal, and lay it on the chair. I'm squatting at this point; I daren't touch the floor, for the slick layer of fluid on top of it no doubt housed a million eldritch horrors that I wouldn't recover from easily. The desk, too, has 9mm ammunition on it, as well as a pistol (with the clip out, thankfully)

I swap out the power supply quickly and efficiently, and sure enough, dead fried cockroaches fell out of it.

A normal tech would NOPE NOPE NOPE out of there at that point. I didn't; either because I failed my sanity check there

I start to disconnect the SATA hard drive to replace the motherboard, and I'd decided ""screw this, I'm out of here."" I take off the plastic connector from the cable and put it into a second SATA channel on the motherboard, then close up the box (not installing the new motherboard), hook it back up (gingerly using the case to clear away the ammunition and syringes in the desk area for the computer), and press the power button, praying to whatever deities might be listening that the GORRAM THING WILL BOOT WITHOUT ISSUE.

Fate must have had enough schadenfreude for the moment, and got up to leave, skidding my feet on the slick floor again.

When I'd arrived, since it wasn't near the computer. I turned by it on the way out, and I saw two babies on it, not moving at all. I couldn't judge their age; I'm not an expert on childrearing, but they couldn't have been too old. I yelled to the pendulous mass that was in the other room that I was done, and incredibly, he slithered his way back into the room, and asked if his porn was okay. I told him that the data was intact

I cheerfully and calmly make my way out of the house, drive around the corner, come to a halt, pop the trunk, and POUR AN ENTIRE 2-QUART BOTTLE OF PURELL HAND SANITIZER OVER MYSELF, shuddering the whole time, going ""NOPE NOPE NOPE.""

After that, and suggest that they would probably want to make a trip out there.

I'm an IT consultant, about 40% below my price which was on the low end to begin with. Really their bid was totally unrealistic. I've run into this firm a few times over the years and while some of their staff are good generalists none of them know Exchange worth a hoot.

I'd always had a good relationship with the customer, but at the end of the day it's their call so I just went on with my life.

About six weeks later, no mail flowing between any of the Exchange servers, every Exchange server just an island. I find this out when I get a call late one evening at my home from the owner of the other consulting company begging me to pull them out of the fire (he'd been given my contact info from the customer). I told him no thanks, my unspoken reasoning being that they've probably fucked things up badly and that I had better things to do than clean up another consultant's mess. Add in the fact that he was unwilling/unable to pay me in advance - something I've learned is necessary when dealing with the competition - and I just was not interested.

About an hour after we spoke the owner of the other IT firm is at my front door trying to convince me to help them ""for the sake of our customer"". WTF

Cops show up almost immediately. He starts screaming at them, about average for getting through the Dallas County jail,

The customer called me the following day and I again declined to fix the mess. By this time I'd decided I didn't want any of that shit on me

Every now and then we would get old-age pensioners (actually, and were generally self-sufficient, however, if they needed computer work done, because we catered to pensioners, we'd charge them about 1/4 of what it'd cost to take their computers to a retail outlet for repairs.

One day an old guy comes in with his computer, when upgrading to SP1, the key was rendered useless, and he was locked out of his computer.

The boss offered to either order him a new copy of Windows XP

The old guy had come to us for a reason - he was old, understanding guy, didn't get angry or raise his voice, he just seemed so let down. He didn't offer us a sob story or try and convince us, he just accepted his fate, and said he had a copy of whatever his computer came with at home. However, he asked, and burn it to a DVD.

I told him I'd do the job, and boot his computer up with a WinPE live CD.

I then ask him if he's currently struggling with money. He tells me that yes he is, which was about $2000. I told him I'd get his Windows XP working again, but on the condition that he tell no one, as I would be immediately fired. He agreed.

A year earlier I was attending college for computer networking (which taught me nothing. Biggest waste of time ever), so I had the government's VLK for that college. I text message my dad to send me the key, and then pretend to back this guys stuff up. A few minutes later I receive the key, put it into XP and activate it. Goes without a hitch, everything boots back up, and is back to working condition.

The old guy is ecstatic, but thanking the company for backing his stuff up for him. He pays about $25 or so, and is on his way. 

On his way out I hand him my business card and tell him if he has any more problems, and was off. Never saw him, or heard from him again, but I felt happy to have helped him out.

Of course

Addendum: I realise piracy is generally frowned upon, I was 17 or so back then, so being a broke fucker myself, I could understand why people wouldn't shell out $280 (the price for XP pro in Aus 7 years ago) for it. Thankfully MS have more than halved their prices for Windows. Makes talking people into paying for it so much easier.

I flip the the toggle on the strip and both printers begin powering up.

**WingDings on every Sheet**

We got a phone call that a printer is spitting out extra characters at the top of every page, same issue, we test a few different documents and they all end up printing out with the same issue. We got someone else to send a print job to the printer, same issue. We thought it was odd since the first computer (win 7) might have had the wrong printer driver installed, but the other one was an XP computer that had been printing to this printer for years. The issue turned out that the entire package of paper purchased from the local office supply store had the characters printed on every page. New package of paper later and the printer is printing fine now.



**The Endless Print Queue**

Just got a phone call from a customer, this is one of these Dot Matrix printers with all the paper in a large box so you don't have to refill the printer every so often... Well he it was closing time so instead of turning off the printer and leaving, he left the printer on, and left it printing. We get a phone call this morning asking how to fix the problem (we can hear this printer whirring away printing happily in the background) and our receptionist asked whether or not he turned off the printer when this happened last night. He said ""I did, but then it kept on going when I turned it back on."" Luckily for him/the paper supply the printer jammed at some time in the night and stopped printing until he fixed the jam and called us... So we clear the printer queue and clear out the items and tadaa, the printer stops. Hopefully the next time he will leave the printer off overnight instead.

**Frozen Laptop**

One of our customers fixes trucks, well this story takes place during one of these winters. we got a phone call that one of the computers (a Toughbook even) that had been left in the garage overnight (instead of the nice heated office) had frozen and would not boot. We asked over the phone if anything happens when they press any buttons, nothing happens, so we think its probably a dead battery or faulty motherboard. We do some more troubleshooting and quickly find out that the laptop had not frozen on a process, it had frozen in the garage, the keyboard was stiff and would not move and the computer would not boot. We told them to leave it in the office for a few hours and let it thaw and see if it boots after that. no dice with that, they were too impatient. A few minutes later we get a phone call saying they need a replacement laptop. We get them to send the old one down so we can transfer data from the hard drive to the new laptop, I guess they had the setting up too high

The language was really very basic. It could read characters displayed on the 80x24 mainframe screen, increment and decrement numeric variables, stuff the keyboard buffer, and that was about it.

I started playing around with it a little, an automatic bank-check-details assessment program, little things like that.

One of my tasks was to assist the audit team by extracting local customer records from a list randomly generated at HQ. Previously, and spend all day driving from address A to address B to address C, as the office covered a semi-rural area on the edge of the city. The field agents got about ten minutes for lunch and were lucky to get three or four audits done each day. Being ""the computer guy"", I was put in charge of running the script and handing out the customer names and addresses.

 

After one look, pull up each of the records in turn, determine the customer's postcode, sort the records by that postcode, and print off each name and address. I'd then hand everyone in postcode A to the first field agent, everyone in postcode B to the second field agent, and so on.

Result: Agents now had an hour for lunch and were successfully each auditing up to ten customers a day because they were driving a couple of blocks instead of twenty miles between stops. The team instantly shot from the bottom of the state rankings to the top. Everyone was a HELL of a lot less grumpy. And all because I was the first person to actually stop and *think* about the job they were doing.

And yeah, as it turned out, really was good enough.

* * *

It was summer vacation by now and I was happy to be able to work some more so I could save for my 2 week trip abroad in October. I was scheduled to work 4 or 5 shifts this week when Don called me into his office.

Don’s office wasn’t like the shop, but they were probably from online classes. His desk was one of the tables that had disappeared from the store.

“You know that Ron works as a system administrator at your school right?” Yes Don

The next day I reported for duty at the entrance of my school. 9:00, you are here, we can start unloading the new computers from the van.” 

He used the term new in the most extended sense of the word. The computers were at least 3 years old and most of them had visible damage. There were at least 16 different brands and types. At least they were better than the computers they had now.

We moved the computers into the main hall, “What now?” Ron looked at me with wide eyes, “Now we eat!” It wasn’t even 11:30. He took out a rather large container and walked to the kitchen to put it in the microwave. Ron was the type of person that lived by the motto of “Let’s eat fast so we can eat again!”.

Though I knew better I asked what it was. He looked seriously at me and said “Its my Mystery Stew of course , “It’s got 20 secret ingredients”. I was glad he did not tell me what was in it; I’m not sure I could have stomached that.

After he was done eating his goo

The office was a mess

He looked through stacks of papers and old food containers and finally pulled out his plan for replacing 250 computers. I was to switch out all of the computers while he prepared the servers and created an image to install. Great; let a 16-year-old girl do all the heavy lifting. As an extra bonus

He tossed me a ring of keys. They were master keys for each door in the building. He just gave me a free pass in an empty school. 

* * *

I started with the ground floor. First classroom; 8 computers to be switched. Alright



 **Classroom 1-C : Detention.**



Whenever somebody was send out of class or did something else that warranted a punishment we were sent directly to detention. I’d been there a couple of times myself.

The man who ran detention was in his late forties and not sociable. He would scream obscenities and threaten anyone with more detention that disturbed the peace. The process for detention was simple: you came in the room

Ron had given me an administrator account to make it easy to gain access to the computers. I booted the computer of the detention devil and logged in. Quickly I found a folder on the C-Drive which contained hundreds of word documents. I opened a few and quickly realized these were stories, about him being a slave master in the early 17th century and one about him having sex with a student. 

I knew the student he had written about

I was appalled by his writing, sure, but I never would suspect him of actually living out his fan fiction. The student he wrote about was a horrible person herself. She did not deserve this kind of attention. She would wallow in it, destroying this man’s life for some crazed written fantasy. I copied the files to my usb memory key to hold on to, just in case. I shrugged it off and went on and continued with the rest of the classroom. 

A couple of classrooms down I came to 1-K. Just two computers to switch. It was the the classroom of my former math teacher. He was nice and considerate and back when I was 14 he had helped me out a great deal. I still regard him as one of the best teachers I ever had. He was, in a school full of hormone raged underdeveloped teenagers. 

Once all the boys went into his classroom in only their boxer shorts. He could laugh about it and just pretended that nothing was out of the ordinary. This did garner him a lot of respect. He however was brought down to tears by two boys just before the summer vacation. His partner had died just a few months before from cancer and they had said some terrible things about this. They were suspended for 2 weeks but back in just a few days. Their parents were proud of them

I felt sorry for my teacher and decided to make him feel welcome again. I colored the chalkboard in the rainbow colors and wrote a big welcome back message in the middle. I left his PC with a note attached; “I know our computers are pretty bad
* * *

Afterwards I still felt like I had not done enough for this teacher. The boys needed punishment. Capital punishment. I hated them so much for doing this to the teacher,” was all that I could read in the look he gave me. I told them what I wanted to do. They were in. 

A few weeks after school had started the boys were at it again

I posted an anonymous note to the principal that the two boys had porn on their accounts and waited. The wait wasn’t very long. The very next day

Rumors spread fast about what they had done and their punishment. They came back 4 weeks later. They had no computer privileges anymore

The other part that was greatly amusing was ""YOU SEEM TO FORGET THAT MY E-MAIL STILL WORKS FINE WHEN IT WORKS."" I don't even know what to say about that

Another great part is that she tends to include things she has to do in her day

A long time ago in a galaxy far

I worked for a Telcom Giant (henceforth TelecomGiant#1) that was selling IT outsourcing.  We would install a network onto multiple sites, you'd call us and we'd take care of it for you.  Basically for one large lump sum every month you no longer needed an IT department.

I was a Project Manager working in implementation.  That's the part where we rip out all your old networking gear and replace it with new sparkly gear that we manage remotely.  My job was to coordinate among the MANY stakeholders to make sure everything got done.  Among the parties I was dealing with were the *LEC* (local exchange carrier, and the *engineers* (these were the CCNA and CCIE guys in my building that designed the networks and told the FOTS what to do).

OK, the FOTS will be on call to plug everything in the same day, and our engineers are ready to troubleshoot.

Well it turns out that the wife of the CMC CEO wasn't going to be home until 3pm that day.  And she had to leave at 4pm for some charity event. She had some rare prize-wining tulips in her flowerbeds and she wanted to be there to make sure her flowerbeds weren't ripped up.  So CMC CEO has his people call our people and word comes down to me that the circuit has to be installed between 3 and 4 that afternoon.

Sure thing!  I call up the customer rep at the LEC and tell him

Faaak.

Well, sorry.""

If the LEC didn't show up between 3 and 4 the install was going to be refused, a two month delay from a vendor (us) on a multi-million dollar contract is likely to piss off Mr. CEO.  And when CEOs get pissed, off contracts get torn up and people get fired.  This is bad news.

So I kick this up to my boss, THAT IS ALL.""

This thing snowballs and the CEO of my company, TelecomGiant#2 to get this scheduled.  If you've spent any time watching CNBC I can assure you you've seen both these guys.

But the CEO of TelecomGiant#2 sticks to his guns!  ""Look, I'd have to make an exception for everyone.  Cats and dogs lying down together.  Anarchy.  Sorry, can't do it.""

Many meetings are had!  Basically we go forward with the 8-hour window and pray they show up between 3 and 4.  If they do, how TelecomGiant#2 fucked us, and hopefully the blowback from CMC CEO won't land on us full force.

Well this sucks!

So I go to our engineers and ask to see the reports of any install done within a 50 mile radius of CMC CEO's house.  I go through them and notice that the majority are installed by one particular tech from the LEC

What do we know about Joe?  Joe is a union guy who drives around in his truck all day laying cable for unappreciative sods.  There's probably no love lost between Joe and ""management"".  So I ring up Joe.

TOK: ""Hey Joe

Joe: ""Ay-up.""

TOK: Do you get the tickets ahead of time or do they give them to you each morning?

Joe: Nah we get 'em ahead of time.

TOK: So this Friday you've got a T1 at 123 Anywhere St

Joe: Yeah

TOK:  OK look.  I need a favor man.  The customer wants it installed at exactly 3pm but TelecomGiant#2 doesn't schedule installs.  My boss is breathing down my neck on this one.  If there's any possible way you could show up there at 3pm it would be a HUGE favor to me.  I'm really getting a lot of heat on this man.

Joe:  Ahhhh. Yeah.  No problem man.

TOK: Oh wow!  I would appreciate that so much!  If you can do that it would mean so much to me!

Joe:  Yeah.  No problem man.  I'll be there at 3.

So on the big day everyone is on the edge of their seats, and everything goes smoothly.  Upper management at TelecomGiant#1 and TelecomGiant#2 think its just some freaky coincidence that it went off without a hitch.  And life moves on.

1376102742.0,1k2gxx,Retail Moron and the Printer of Doom,trrwilson,601,113,63,"Quick background.  IT support for a bank, and this is a long one.

About our banking software: it has two parts.  A UNIX mainframe with terminal emulators on each PC, and UNIX actually runs the transactions.   Each branch also has a unique number for lots of reasons.  However, not each branch number refers to an actual physical location.  We have ""shadow branches"" that are set up so employees can still do banking transactions, even if they aren't an actual branch.  This comes into play later.

Second bit of background info: each physical branch has a check printer.  They are named in such a way as to indicate which branch they are at i.e. CHKPRT12345.  When a branch opens, and one in GUI.  Our company has no access to the GUI or UNIX servers, we only have access to the windows print servers. The bank's internal IT department has to create the UNIX and GUI queues.  Some of you can probably guess what's coming.

A few months ago, plans are made, dates are decided on.  At this point, the bank's project manager, let's call her Retail Moron, or RM, has to submit assorted requests to various departments.  One request is to have the check printer be set up in UNIX and GUI because it's an upgrade from a shadow branch to the real thing. Any predictions about what happened yet?

Well, and successfully print a test page. We left the building at 6 pm on Saturday, with me staying through to Monday to do day-1 support.

Surprisingly

BM: We can't print checks!
Me: OK

Printer is pulling paper

Me: OK
Her: OK

A week passes, the contract manager, BM, and our help desk supervisor. ""Branch 12345 (the one that was just upgraded) isn't able to print checks and no action has been taken.  This needs to be resolved immediately!""

I go through our ticket history and find out the user never called the help desk.  BM went straight to RM and started whining.  Because it's high priority

I show up, and test pages from the server will print.  Our remote support team and myself know that it's a UNIX or GUI issue at this point.  I e-mail a person from each team explaining what's going on.  They ignored us almost all day, we put read receipts on our messages, and they weren't even looked at for 5 hours.  They don't want to mess with anything unless I replace the printer.  I replace the printer, our server team sets up the print queue on the server.  After all this, I'm back to where I started, with the new printer behaving just like the old one.  At this point, and all the UNIX and GUI support teams are gone.  I haul my exhausted self back to my home office.

Our teams spends the next three days trying to get a response from the UNIX and GUI programmers.  We're forwarding e-mail from retail moron to the programmers, but it won't go live until their maintenance window, which is overnight between Wednesday and Thursday every other week. This is in 8 days. They're actually apologetic about the whole thing, but maintenance is maintenance and can't be rescheduled.

Throughout this whole ordeal, mostly directed at our company.  We're not giving this enough attention, even though the bank internal IT is what's holding things up.

First thing Thursday morning after the maintenance window, replace the printer again, and get a repeat of the previous events.  The printer is physically sound, it's on the network, the windows print queue is working, and it exists in GUI.  At this point, we're all screaming at UNIX to check the programming.  Finally, they need an official request before they can upgrade it from ""shadow branch"" to full-service. They also can't create the UNIX queue until the upgrade happens.

At this point, since we are that incompetent (I'm paraphrasing from various e-mail and comments made during meetings)

We start going through project logs and find out that Retail Moron never requested anything to do with the check printer.  The submission form keeps a log of visits.  She never once even opened the website to submit the form.  The b**** wind went out of her sails in an instant.  She couldn't berate or lie her way out of a situation she had created. At this point, the UNIX group has to do an immediate programming change, execute their testing immediately, and push the changes into production as soon as testing is complete. All this mean a fair bit of overtime for some highly-paid UNIX guys.

We and the UNIX team billed Retail Moron's department for nearly 200 hours of project work

How very wrong I was.

I am constantly harassed for stupid problems in the middle of the night

One particular incident a nurse called me 3 times in one night between 3:00-4:00am because she locked out her account

I wake up the next day with 4 voice mail messages from the same nurse sighing sarcastically into the phone.

* 4:18am
* 4:22am
* 5:36am
* 6:04am

The messages weren't constructive even though I knew who it was so I didn't do anything about it until she sent me an email the next day when I once again unlocked/reset her account and notified her.

------

Flash forward 2 weeks. Our HR manager gives me a copy of a sheet of paper that is this nurse issuing a formal complaint about my behavior. To summarize she states that I ""never answer the phone

I'm pretty fucking livid.

I go to our DON (Director of Nursing) and she recognizes the sheet of paper as I walk into the room and says ""I wondered when that would get back to you."" (our DON is awesome). Basically we have a short discussion to clarify if she knows what my job description entails

1) I am never on call and I am always on call. I carry a work cell phone to respond to emergencies but I am not specifically 'on call'. IT is the only department that is not paid on-call pay to answer the phone and help people after hours.

2) I am not always by a computer nor am I always available to help at every conceivable moment. I have a life

3) 'Forgot a password"" is not an emergency which warrants waking me up multiple times at 3:00am after I've already had an 8-10 hour work day. Nurses remembering their passwords and knowing how to access our system without locking themselves out is part of their job. It is well withing my ability to require them to submit password resets in writing signed by their supervisor for HIPAA security reasons to make everyone's life a living hell. Nurses need to take personal responsibility to utilize the systems appropriately.

Through the whole conversation the DON completely agreed with me. She wasn't aware they had become as much of a nuisance as they had

Two weeks have passed and I haven't received a single late night password reset call. I would have loved to be a fly on the wall in the meeting to see the DON put the fear of god in her employees. Sometimes it's nice to have someone on your side

It was a calm Friday at the local cable office when I noticed that it was time for lunch.  I retired to the empty conference room and began my daily ritual of browsing reddit.  Suddenly a cold wind cut me to the bones and I heard the plant manager mutter a single solitary word.  ""Crap"".

Quick as a flash he ran down the hall to the office server.

I rushed to the server and found the manager confounded.  The office was cutoff the company network.  No one had internet access at all.  I then informed our master of all things wireless to our data issue.  The blood drained from his face.  The office phones were also down so we resorted to our cell phones.

Then the bat phone rang.  Turns out that Technician Scissorhands was splicing some fiber in the next town over and cut the blue wire instead of the red one.  All field staff were immediately sent to the assist and everyone else sat and waited.  Thankfully everything was fixed within 45 minutes and we were back online.  But the worst was yet to come.

Since the office phones were down as well as our computers all calls were redirected to the main office some 180 miles away.  Turns out that everyone for 50 miles in every direction and a small island had lost cable *everything*, and explaining that everything was fixed we thought we were in the clear.

His family had, at great cost, sent him to rehab and they had provided him with pills containing fake opiates to be taken ""as needed"". While I'm sure these fake opiates ""did not provide the same rush as pure, clean, honest heroin"" it was enough to keep him from going back... I think.

Once his work piled up sufficiently, he would call me in and I would knock out six or seven computers and get him back on track. He would spend the time lounging on the couch he had brought from home and shoved into the corner.

I grab a non-conductive plastic rod (read: back end of a BIC pen) and jiggle the AC contact. It's loose. I calmly explain to the woman that her AC jack had come loose. As this was an older model and we had a standing policy not to do MOBO soldering unless under the most dire of cicumstances, the motherboard may be very expensive, assuming we could find it at all, and most likely her best option was to replace the laptop.

I gave her a print out of the specs she needs to look for in her new laptop, and I begin my work.

**Act IV: The Worst Possible Thing**

So I pulled her HDD. Always interested in providing the best customr service, and found that I could in fact manage it, though it was tricky.

I spent the next week perfecting the use of MiniXP, it was slow that week, and honestly it was just to see if I *could*.

She finally returns

""Well, then he told me about this really great sounding machine called a MacBook. He said that it never gets viruses, and it won't break down on me like this one did!""

The smile left my face. ""You... you bought a Mac?"" She placed the box on the counter. It hadn't even been opened yet. This woman had NO IDEA what she had purchased yet. I was to spend the next five hours explaining to her why the Mac was not in her best interest, Mac's do get viruses.

I don't know if she didn't believe me. I don't know if she just didn't care. But the end result was me struggling to load all the NTFS formatted information onto the MacOS formatted drive. Silently cursing the man from Worst Purchase, but it was the beginning of a long and terrible war.

And so it came to be that after many months working on this federal government helpdesk, that I did not know about the network and the systems attached thereto, and this was indeed fairly true when it came to the official stuff. However, not everything to be found beneath the relatively bland facade was strictly on the up-and-up, as I was to discover.  
   
The day started like any other - like most of the team, was seated at the corner desk, studiously working through some of the simpler tickets to do with retrieving various misplaced files on network shares. All in all, as about as idyllic as Helpdesk work ever gets. When suddenly, there came - a silence.  
   
This may seem like a strange concept, should be there. It took me a moment to identify the source, and I wasn't the first - other ears had pricked up across the desks, and heads were turning. Towards the recruit. Who was frozen.  
   
The sound whose absence had caught our attention was his typing. And the reason for this abrupt cessation was all too clear from the way his hands were seemingly jammed in midair over his keyboard

   

For behold! The Kid Wonder had stumbled across some enterprising public servant's porn folder. And not just any porn folder! This one was filled with a variety of interesting poses one could achieve with fruit

So, the obligatory red tape had to take over. A quiet word in the ear of HR resulted in *quite a few* auditors all gathering around the PC in the corner and making tut-tut noises, and it was eventually decided that according to policy, there needed to be hard-copy evidence produced of the, ah, offending items.  
   
Thus it was that Newguy McPornfinder found himself in the position of having to play through the pornos, a squad of unsmiling HR drones was sent to surround the printer and confiscate the prints as they slid salaciously out of the slot.  
  
   
  
Now, he decided that he was going to get through this eye-searing duty as rapidly as possible. Thus, he set his default printer to the color queue, queued up the movies, clicked randomly to a couple of points in each one, hotkeyed a screendump to the printer, and moved onto the next file quicker'n a greased ferret. The result - several dozen shots of Fanny and Fido doing the horizontal mambo near-instantly stacked up in the print queue and started to be processed.  
   
It wasn't until he had dumped something like fifty full-page extra-magenta-ink images into the queue that one of the suits who had been standing around the color printer showed up and asked how long it was going to be before their porn factory started delivering the goods. Only then did Sparky McNevergonnaliveitdown think to double-check *which* color print queue he'd set as default.  
   
Hint: Not the one on our floor.  
   
Now, were still fairly rare beasts. Not many departmental sections had the clout to be able to request one and make that request stick. The entire IT department had one, half for 'testing' and half for the CIO's pie charts. The CFO had one outside his office for the national annual report. And way, way at the top of the building, where the walls were mainly glass and the chairs were leather, there was a color printer right smack dab in the middle of the executive...  
   
*...secretaries.*  
   
Guess which printer fifty megs of Debbie Does Doggies had gone to?  

   

Now, and the time I replaced an internal modem in a powered-on PC and got blown across the room when I brushed the wrong piece of metal. But I have never before nor since seen public servants run up six flights of stairs without touching a single one, yet still have the energy to burst into the executive wing and launch themselves across the floor while yelling ""DON'T LOOK AT THE PRINTER!!!""  
   
The collection of young, apparently, taken a little aback.  

   

Fortunately for the forces of ~~good~~ policy, in the following week, to construct the Deporninator...  
   

...but that's a story for another time.

One of the problems with working IT in an underfunded team was that the Helpdesk area was just a group of desks in the corner of one of the floors of an office building, I was sick of having people walk up behind me and watch whatever work I was doing as if it was free entertainment.  

So I sat down with a crude graphics editor and dreamed up an icon.  

It was a very simple icon, and saved another icon. Then again, and again, and again, until I had sixteen very innocuous icons. Which I compiled into an animated GIF. All you'd see on this image was, apparently, a green crosshair drifting quite slowly from the bottom right to the top left

I proceeded to tile this across my entire desktop background. A bright green grid drifting eternally upwards and to the left...  
   
  
It took me a few hours to get used to, started having their eyes tell them that everything in the center of their field of view was drifting *down* and to the *right*, yet the edges of their vision (the rest of the room) were sliding *up* and to the *left*. I had at least one voyeur turn green and stumble away, and another wannabe shoulder-surfer walk into a door after losing fine control of their legs.  

Of course, and I'm sure there were health advantages to constantly power-walking past our area while resolutely (some might say desperately) focusing on the far wall. Not to mention monetary savings from all those skipped lunches.  

However, and after running into the limitations of DOS batch files, had picked up a book on Perl for the very first time. I was going vampire hunting, with a script I would come to call Buffy...

It was a dark time for the Helpdesk...  

We were halfway through upgrading from Win3.11 to Win95, or otherwise too annoying to spend time on repairing. Only due to a number of technological limitations, we could only rebuild workstations which were equipped with an external (floppy) drive, and all the user workstation drives had been pulled out and trashed for security reasons.  

So the process for rebuilding a PC was - physically go out to the desk in whichever building (sometimes crossing major roads to do so), plug it into the LAN there, crack the case, attach a floppy drive to the motherboard, boot the PC, adjust the BIOS so it booted from A: drive, take the one single floppy disk that the Helpdesk was allowed to have on hand, put the disk into a server drive, go back down the stairs to the Helpdesk, reboot the PC

What with scheduling and everything else

Fuck.

 

So I got a bit annoyed at this

*However...* both images used many of the same files, were not in the same places in the images - one had most of them in the root, one had most of them in an A:\DOS directory. So I couldn't simply merge the images, either.  

*However-however...* the sum total size of the files which were unique to each image, and I sat down to write a new text file. Some sort of clue-bat, to toggle states...  

 

The result was TOGGLE.BAT. All it did was look at the structure of the files on the floppy, and ask to continue or not.) Thus, we didn't have to keep running up and down the stairs to the server room in order to reimage the single boot disk(!) we were allowed to have. Average rebuild times dropped from five working days to around 24 hours, deskside to deskside. And I had some time freed up to think about how to get around the entire floppy drive debacle...  

...but that's a story for another time.

At this point he tells me that he has a wireless printer so I check whether the printer he is printing to is being picked up and surprise surprise its not so I ask him how he set up the printer. At this point he tells me he thought it would work if he just put the printer close to the laptop and leave it because it was wireless and thats how his internet works (he forgot that I set that up). So after putting in the CD that was still ignored in the printer box lo and behold it works.

1352459896.0,12wpyv,"""I don't want to do that.""",theOtherJT,571,104,59,"This morning we received a very angry email from one of the office drones. Apparently she's been unable to get any work done for the last 2 days because of a serious problem with our software setup and it has to be fixed as a matter of utmost urgency! ... that said it'll be hard to be urgent about it at this point since it's a Friday and she's gone home early

The problem presents as her being unable to access any email from any machine other than her own. This is totally unacceptable since she's on reception next week instead of at her desk and needs to be able to continue to do email from there. 

Most odd. 

We have a pretty comprehensive roaming setup here, so I'm assuming this must be a problem with the pc... perhaps someone has pulled the network lead or something and she's unable to distinguish ""I can't log on"" from ""I can't send email"" (you never know with some people)

So, there's my profile, there's outlook, contacts, the lot. 

This one goes round the support team a few times, that's definitely a problem, we'll get that fixed... not email related tho, right? 

Wrong. 

At some point in the past she decided that she didn't like the interface on the old web email system and bookmarked all the individual pages for ""new mail"" ""inbox"" ""important-work-folder"" ""pictures-of-cats-folder"" etc. 

Impressively the [mail system upgrade last week](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/12nuft/the_colours_children_the_colours/) actually maintained compatibility with these book marks

Ok. 

So we draft up the usual ""We're aware that there's a problem with the bookmark roaming in chrome on windows workstations, you can still access your email either using the Outlook or Thunderbird email clients that are pre-configured and linked from the desktop on Windows workstations, or from the Thunderbird client on the Linux workstations. You can also access the web interface from any device by going to [address] and logging in with your normal departmental username and password.""

The answer that we got back was a single line and fairly enlightening as to the true nature of the problem...

O listen and hearken, defenders of logic and righteousness, for this is a Story.  

It is not the story of the Desktop of Insanity. Nor is it the story of the Server Which Didn't Exist. Those are yet to be told. This is the story of the Deporninator

   

One upon a time, [seen public service porn go to the wrong printer](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/w1fyo/of_puppies_printers_and_why_you_should_always/), and thought he knew it all.  

He was young, and he went to the Little Boss W. He went to W at nine after shift-start, saying ""I can do something about all this porn by five this afternoon.""  

Up looked W from his desk and his headset

He was young, and he went to the Middle Boss Z. He went to Z at eleven in the morning, saying ""I can do something about all this porn by five this afternoon.""  

Up looked Z from seat and his paperwork

He was young, and he went to the Big Boss A. He went to A at two after lunchtime, saying ""I can do something about all this porn by five this afternoon.""  

Up looked A from her desk and her red tape

So the tech took a PC -- a plain old PC -- and set it on the network scanning drives. It was scanning not for deep porn

It scanned on!  

This was Windows 3.1 -- ancient Windows 3.1 -- and few of us there knew it had a limit on its search. But that would come much later

It scanned on!  

Five hundred images. Ten thousand images. Fifty thousand images, and the number kept on rising, and it soon became quite clear that 3pm had moved to 4.  

It scanned on!  

Four PM rolled closer, and still the scans found more. Eventually, the sheepish tech, now wanting to be done by five, stopped the scan, and hit DEL, having first selected ""All"".  
   

So 5pm rolled 'round, just rolled her eyes and quirked a smile, for she had seen techs try and try, and never had they cleaned the whole Department of its porn!  

The tech was slightly miffed

At 9am, and once more they were cleared. And lunchtime rolled around, and inwardly our tech friend cheered. For surely one more run of the Deporninator, now, would clear the remnants from the LAN - the porn would die, and how!  
  
The hours passed. Then days. Then weeks. On ev'ry fresh-run scan: another hundred thousand files
   

And finally, it's still there now, forever killing porn.
  
   
  
And that, because it was not long afterwards that the employer decided that a thousand staff and their workstations needed to be shuffled about inside the same building, and this had to be completed over a weekend.

Previously, I ran into a job I hadn't been expecting.  

---  

I showed up bright and early, a rough run-down of the building layouts we'd be doing deskside support in, and so forth. And as the newbie, I of course got assigned the hazing ticket as my first job.  

The manager handed it to me, and that it wasn't booting. Could I have a look at it?  

 
Sure thing

 
So I take the ticket and trot up a couple of flights of stairs until I reach the designated area. Surprisingly, the manager in question was even present, and the server itself was actually in existence. And sure enough, it had power but wasn't completing the boot process. And it was a LONG process.  

So I tried a bunch of things, there were five possible things which could be causing it by being plugged in the wrong way, and no keyed connectors. Added to this was the problem that the machine guts were so cramped that making a change to one of these connectors and then booting and testing the result took about a quarter hour per change. (Long boot process, remember?)  

Well... five things which could each be in one of two positions. That's a finite number of configurations. And if I assigned each connector to its own mutually orthogonal vector in connectorspace

 
Thus emboldened, test. Nope. Configuration #3 of 32...

 
...  

 
...  

 
...configuration #30 of 32, there's gotta be a 50% chance, NO.  

Fuck it. Configuration #32 of 32

 
It boots.  

It goddamn boots. Passes all the cross-checks

So I peel myself off the floor, and tell him that the machine no-one else has managed to get operational in six months is now up and running. There may have been a ""booyah""; I deny everything. And to finish off, I get to schlep myself back to the Helpdesk area and report back in.  

Only... remember how many configurations I had to step through

 

...yeah. Not the most auspicious first day on the job. Particularly when I tell him that the Server Time Forgot, belonged to his *personal friend*, is now up and running, and the Boss says ""Oh, that wasn't actually important, no-one's been using it for six months after all.""

I have her read me the serial number off the meter and immediately know there is nothing I can do for her

I calmly try to explain this to her but she starts to cry, she can't take it anymore.  I decided to see if I could help her figure out where it's coming from.  

I have her hold up her phone and I crank my ear piece to max and strain to hear anything. After a minute i hear a very very faint ""beep"".  She comes back on the line a bit after that and I tell her to move to a different room and repeat the process.  We're engaged in a cross country telephonic version of marco-polo at this point.

I ask her

""I did get a new microwave""

I ask her to go over to the microwave and I hear an even louder beep through the phone. I ask her what is the microwave doing. She says the door is open so the light stays on, now the light is off in the microwave and I can't see anything in the dark!""

I ask her to bear with me and give it a few minutes to see if we hear the beep.  5 minutes go by and no beep can be heard.  I'm smiling and kinda proud I went the extra mile to help and older customer out.  She the proceeds to harsh my mellow by stating how this is unacceptable

The store was quiet without Frank &amp; Richard. Though I’ve had my problems with them during the years I would be lying if I said that I did not miss them. I really did miss those idiots. Something else that was missing from the store at the time were customers.

The fact that Frank &amp; Richard had overcharged an elderly couple for their services had made rounds around the town by word of mouth and a front page article on the local paper. People were outraged - rightly so - and had stopped coming to the store.

I talked with Frank &amp; Richard again about two weeks after they had been fired and they had become personae non gratae in the town. They had applied to a number of jobs in town

Ron &amp; Don were agitated and restless in weeks after the incident had taken place. They were angry that Frank &amp; Richard ruined their “at home repair” business and wanted everyone to know.

It wasn’t until 2 weeks later that they started noticing that the whole situation with Frank &amp; Richard had a bigger impact then they had expected. It seemed as if they finally understood that customers equals money and trust is a viable part of a business model.

There was now an urgency in their attempts to attract customers to the store again. They had placed a - by our standards - massive order of cheap Chinese notebooks a few weeks before and were now afraid there would be no customers that would buy them. 

Ron and Don locked themselves away in Don’s office to create a new plan to make people come to our store again. The control of day to day store operations was handed over to Marcel and Johan. Jeremy who ran the store before the two goons had come on board decided to keep his mouth shut and see what Johan and Marcel were worth when left to tend to the store.

Though Johan and Marcel were much alike in their personalities; arrogant, but needed to use it regardless. Instead of being helped they would be tortured.

One day Marcel and Johan were in the store when a customer came into the store looking for a new notebook. She was the type of person that didn’t know much about computers and knew it. I loved helping these kinds of customers. Marcel and Johan had decided to double down on her and help her to find a new notebook.

According to Jeremy who followed the conversation from the back she asked a lot of questions that were trivial  for anyone knowledgeable with computers. But they were genuine questions

A few days later another fine example of their customer knowledge was taking place in the store. This time around it was an elderly couple that was looking for a new notebook to use for chatting with their grandchildren in Canada. It didn’t took to long before Marcel and Johan starting having a discussion about CMOS and CCD image sensors. The elderly couple was completely ignored and when trying to interject were told to shut up.

So while Ron &amp; Don were scheming away

* * *

We have never been the only computer store in town. There was a store about 2 block down that had opened years before Ron &amp; Don started their store. It was comparable to our store

The owner

Eric had always been a nuisance to the store as he’d placed fake orders from time to time on the more expensive and hard to sell items and whenever he had a customer that was troublesome he would always refer him to us.

His anger towards Ron &amp; Don had grown even more when the store became popular with the sale of Chinese knockoffs. It wasn’t until the story of Frank &amp; Richard broke that he had gotten the ammunition to annoy Ron &amp; Don even more. His ammo was to keep the story of Frank &amp; Richard alive.

It started innocently enough with pamphlets delivered in the dead of night to people’s houses in the near area. It featured the article from the local newspaper and the message to choose a store you trust. At this moment it could have been any of the other stores that were on the other side of the town. 

The pamphlets stopped being delivered to people’s houses but instead now ended up plastered to the shopwindow. I wish he hadn’t done that because it meant two things; Jeremy had to clean it up and Ron &amp; Don wanted to go to war; fueled by enthusiasm of Marcel and Johan. 

They had created their own pamphlets which focussed on their efforts taken after the incident

When it came to distribution of the folders they had tried to get Jeremy and me to spread them around. Jeremy luckily for him had a few days off to visit his grandparents on the other side of Germany. And when I got called I had played the silence game and didn’t answer. I had 12 missed calls.

Marcel and Johan were the one’s that ended up delivering the folders from door to door.
To my surprise a rather large amount of people seemed more than willing to forget everything that happened for a 20% discount on overpriced hardware. The shop seemed to be nearing it’s usual traffic again a few days into the promotion. Ron &amp; Don where happy and putting real pressure on Jeremy

Eric wasn’t happy with the fact that Ron and Don’s store started gaining customers again. He wanted the store to be closed down. He started playing dirty and launched another attack on the store; annoying customers.

I had a short holiday vacation and worked the friday with Johan and Marcel when they started coming in. Eric had paid a few first years at my school to mess around in the store; to break items and harass customers and employees. 

It began with them browsing around and asking Marcel and Johan for non-existent hardware and ridiculous questions about software packages. They moved on to the demo units of the Chinese tablets and started handling them rather hard handedly. Marcel and Johan freaked out and quickly went up to the kids ordering them to stop. They refused. 

Marcel quickly grabbed a tablet out of on of the kids hands and handed it over to Johan. The kid started shouting about Marcel stealing from him

It was around now that one of the kids gave a kick to Johan’s leg causing him to fall to his knees

Johan now was in a row with the kids

About two or three minutes into the argument Don finally understood that he could not have a fight with customers and his personnel in the store. It would bring everything that happened in the last couple of weeks back to the minds of people. It was then and there that he decided in the middle of the argument decided to utter the word “You are fired” to Johan.

It surprised me when Marcel interjected that Don could not do that and that he and Marcel were right! They were the one’s running the store after all! Ron and Don both became angry at this point and decided to fire Marcel as well.

Marcel and Johan grabbed their bags and jacket from the back

The situation was way out of hand and Ron and Don fixed it the only way they knew how to. Money. They gave the kids a free mp3 player for their troubles and the customers an apology and rather big discount to never mention this again. They didn’t. The store was safe. But Eric was winning. The store was crumbling. ",,t5_2sfg5,1354203389.0,,tftsflair,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/13yd2g/chapter_13_the_competition/

**Disclaimer. I didn't learn much from my time spent in this role. As such, that contains multiple ports to plug into. Jack = the individual port that a cable plugs into.

**Act 1: The Rising Sun**

I knew i should feel bad about my unintentional betrayal. I really should. But I was excited. I was finally making progress in my life! Soon I would learn about those enigmas known as ""servers"". How do they work? How are they were set up? What does a patch panel look like? What about the main switch racks? What are these new and exciting things and how long would it take me to learn how to use them efficiently! Would I learn Unix? Scripting? Maybe I would be called to use my completely useless HTML knowledge to update the website. The possibilities were ENDLESS!

Boy was I wrong. Instead of stepping into a beautiful wonderland of magic and excitement

Now, this was no small feat. People from our league were constantly recruited by the local pro team for their practice squad. And not a ""meh"" team like Kansas City or Detroit. This is a team with multiple Superbowl wins that consistently goes to the playoffs. Our league was essentially seen as the first step towards a *real* chance at a professional career. So to paraphrase, I'm above average height and used to be built like Lou Farigno's punching bag.

OK, Head of IT. He looks up from his meal of recently killed pterodactyl, and stands to greet me. This man is massive. He stands a head taller than me with short, fine blonde hair. His chest is as wide as my shoulders, and his arms as big as my thighs. In another world, I might have called him... Dovahkiin.

His massive hand engulfs mine (Jesus

I perked up. What could it possibly be? I was personally being asked to assist in the SERVER ROOM by the HEAD OF IT! I must have made more of an impact than I thought! What could possibly be so important?

**Act II: Into the Labyrinth**

""I need you to organize the IT storage room.""

Ned the Neanderthal opens the door and points to a small room. I peek inside to see piles upon piles of Cat5, adapters, USB extenders, monitors, printers, USB cables of various lengths and form factors, old Pcs, frankensteins, so I would have no distractions.

Still half believing I was the subject of some sick office prank, playing Tetris on my Super Nintendo. I recalled when the bullies in my boyscout group had tied my rope into an almost incomprehensible knot. And I remembered the day I rearranged my room in the name of teenage rebellion, doubling the walking space even after I added the high-back chair for pretending I was smoking a pipe and reading by candle light. Opening my eyes, I knew I could do it.

It took three days, every cable and part placed in a meticulously labeled drawer. I had not only cleaned, but I had *organized*. video cables in one drawer, USB related cables in another. An entire section of drawers dedicated to packaged and unpackaged cat5 cables of various lengths and colors. Docking stations and printer supplies in the metal closet, right below the tape backups, organized by date. Software and registry keys in the filing cabinet, organized by software type and asset tag of the installed machine. My god

There was one loose end. One final thing bugging me. The office had a staff of 100 people. Each person had two monitors. Each monitor came with a VGA cable. And each VGA cable had been replaced with a DVI cable. I had 200 VGA cables

I piled them all in a box and labeled it as ""Abandon Hope All Ye Who Enter Here. Box of Forlorn Hope, propósito Perdido y Cables VGA. NO ABRIR.""

I then shoved the box into the corner.

Finally

**Act 3: In which a 1 becomes a 0**

Having exercised my god-like organizational prowess, read the news, play some flash games, walk the floor, etc etc. One day, I was approached with important information™. New hardware is coming in, and is expected to be here on my shift. I am to learn the inventory system

These are the three things I was told about the inventory system: 1) The firewall uses MAC filtering and assigns static IP addresses based on the MAC. 2) Once an item has been entered into the inventory system you'll need to input it's MAC and allow the system to assign it an IP. 3) If it isn't in the inventory

This meant that everything, and set up to be allowed into both the wired network AND the wireless network (since each MAC address needs to be entered into the system)

This didn't seem so hard, but then the phone rings again, and again. All calls are saying the same thing. I begin to tell people ""it's a known issue, we're working on it"" but the calls just keep coming. They're so numerous that they have bypassed me, filled up KungFu Managers phone, and started getting routed to the central office. Then my cellphone rings. It's KungFu Manager.

PM: ""Yeah boss?""

KFM: ""WHAT. DID. YOU. DO.""

PM: ""I didn't do ANYTHING! The new hardware showed up and I was entering everything into the system just like you showed me! Then

KFM: ""Just like I... shit. I never taught you how to export the new DHCP table to the firewall. Oh man

PM: ""What do you mean? How bad are we talking!? Did I BREAK the NETWORK!?""

KFM: ""Ok

PM: ""Corrupts the... *entire*... table...""

Now, we were turbo-boned. Enter my savior, Ned the Neanderthal!

Ned: ""WHAT have you done to MY network!""

PM: ""Oh

Ned: ""Okay

KFM: ""Is that Ned? Dammit

PM: ""Here

Ned: ""Thank god. Hey KFM, email, anything like that? Fine... fine... ok. Alright. Here, he wants to talk to you again.""

PM: ""So whats the plan?""

KFM: ""Hey man, I told him we wouldn't have him back up for 24 hours.""

The firewall had been manually programmed by company owner, nope... I'm going with the scorn.

*Side Note - Our phones were run off of a PBX server, *and* **blue for phones**. *I had exactly zero access to the PBX server.*

Individually, I can only check for an IP address, cycle the power, and escalate it to the PBX admin: KungFu Manager. However, having BOTH of these happen at the same workstation simultaneously was something new. I walk to his desk praying this wouldn't end with me climbing through the ceiling looking for a cut line.

Phone is not getting an IP address. Computer is assigned an APIPA. Cant ping out

After some searching I find them. The mounting has been COMPLETELY RIPPED out of the wall

PM: *pointing* ""Whats the deal with this?""

Buzz: ""I don't know

PM: ""I... I helped set up all these work stations. In fact, we were expected to unpack on your behalf. So I know two things. One, this has not 'always been like this' and two, you are the only person who has been assigned to this desk. So I'm going to ask you again, what is the deal with **this**?""

Buzz: ""I swear I didn't touch it

PM: ""So you didn't touch these cables AT ALL?""

Buzz: ""Nope

I stare at Buzz for a second. Then look back down at the cables

PM: ""Alright

Buzz: ""How longs it gonna be?""

As I'm walking away, while Buzz was at lunch, I returned to his desk. Crouching down like some kind of Ninja Secret Agent Operative Spy, I disconnected the cables. I then plugged the phone into the BLUE jack, and the computer into the WHITE jack. Problem solved.

I contacted facilities and told them of a removed mounting. I notated the issue and closed the ticket. I found out later that after the mounting had been replaced, and provided him with a longer Cat5 cable.

For a 16 year old, something that is comfortably within my level of clearance so I grab the guy who is supervising me and recreate the issue, at which point we call his boss down with the video camera so we can prove the issue to the guys responsible for final system integration.

So at this point in the story we have the plucky young work experience kid finding a bug that could potentially lead to a notable case of pilot disorientation in a military Jet

My previous employer basically had 2 major customers and 1 of those customers had a problem. CEO's wireless printer isn't printing anymore. There's lots of extremely important documents in the print queue that can't be wiped out.

First tech takes a stab and he tries to reinstall drivers and makes sure everything is wirelessly connected. He spent 10 minutes making sure the laptop he was connected to remotely was wirelessly connected. He couldn't find network and sharing center in XP. The documentation magically had the correct hostname(npi-2nd half of mac address) for the printer and that saved him lots of time trying to find that on the network. 2 hours later the CEO no longer wanted keep trying. He literally had the CEO doing stuff like

Next day the next tech is given a chance. The first tech was #2 guy and the next tech is the #3 guy. He changes drivers and he eventually gets CEO to plug the printer in USB and IT WORKS! Great success just use it THAT WAY.

Next day the #1 guy is given a chance. CEO obviously didnt want USB and none of the important documents have printed. Senior guy is now on the job. He asks what everyone had tried so far and he connects to the machine and instead of even attempting to fix it he misunderstands and just investigates if the printer was compatible with terminal server. Which sure that laptop does but wasn't the issue.

CEO was so mad now and my boss has a meeting. Situation gets explained and we need to make sure we fix this or we were going to get fired. Nobody has any ideas and nobody wants to go anywhere near trying to fix it. Meanwhile I was the new guy and hadn't been given a try so I volunteer. They then start giving me every little bit of info about everything that had been tried so far. I generally didn't pay much attention and asserted that I don't know what they did and I should try everything to make sure. 

My boss says, it was a long drive and I get paged 3 times before I even get there asking if I'd arrived yet. 

I get to this place and I walk in and introduce myself. I take a look at the computer and I was expecting it to be plugged in USB but I didn't see a printer. The CEO went and put everything back where it was. I see the print queue and there's no print error or restarting. I click off 'use printer offline' and it instantly starts printing wirelessly including about 40 test pages which most of them I managed to cancel. I apologized for the poor response time to fixing the issue and for wasting paper.

CEO asks why it took so long to get me on the case to fix it. I explained that I was new and didn't have much experience in IT and they don't really trust me yet. CEO replies

I say

I get back to the office and explain everything that happened and that it could have been fixed remotely. I get in shit 'You should have called to tell us what happened' and I explain I tried to call several times. They say

I then notice he had written up my termination papers and they were on his desk. He sees me reading the paper and he doesn't say a thing. I walk out and go home for the day. All in all one of the better days of working at this job.

They started the call by asking if my computer was having any difficulties as they were calling from The Cure Hub and Microsoft had told them that my computer was in need of repair.

Straightforward
So they asked me what my keyboard looked like and what was next to the Ctrl key, so I said the Windows key.

I was then told to press and hold Win whilst pressing R

Whilst all of this was going on

*I figure that if I can drag out the call then they aren’t able to scam someone else.* 

So with the run box up they ask me to type in Eventvwr to bring up the Event Viewer box
After this I asked where their company was based, Clear Water and then tried to move on ASAP.

At this point the caller asked me how old my computer was and how many I had in the house

At this point she asked me to type w3{dot}thecurehub{dot}com into the run box. Showing the company website and again adding an air of professionalism. 

After being directed around the website I was then told to use the Run dialogue box to go to support{dot}me  and asked what I saw. 

At this point I was then handed over to a “the technical department” a 25-35 Indian sounding male, which caused him difficulty as apparently they can only take Visa or Mastercard. 

He explained that he needed my card details as my warrenty had expired and I needed a new one

So after loading up on Google a fake American express number and giving a random expiry date I was then asked what company my savings account was. 

At this point I would hope that most people would have alarm bells ringing in their head but I once again told a little lie in the name of keeping the scammers away from potential victims.

Once I had given them the fake numbers and a random bank name I was told the support{dot}me code of 4 1 1 4 6 2 and asked to enter it into the website. 

At this point I decided to say that I had to go now, at which point I was told that I needed to sort this out now as otherwise they wouldn’t call again and I would still have all the virus and problems with my computer. I told them to wait.

I kept them on hold now for a good 5 minutes whilst I made myself a drink and came back to find them still on the line

I kept pretending to have difficulty with entering the numbers in and when she demanded that I just enter the numbers and press the “Connect to technician” button I said I wasn’t
At which point the woman caller started shouting “f%*!ing idiot” for about 20 seconds before slamming the phone down. 

Whilst she was shouting I did manage to ask if her parents were proud of her scamming people in between my laughs. 

All in the call lasted 25 minutes of which only about 10 minutes was actually me talking to them and the rest me asking them to wait whilst I got on with work.

You see, for our own project, I had already solved this project. I was sick of loading times that ran into the minutes, so I wrote a tool (using some open source NVIDIA code) to convert PNG and TGA images to DDS textures.

I told them that I would tweak it for a bit and they were ecstatic! It worked very well

Then, clicking on a MEL script and entering ""product"" in the ""Node ID"" field. For 1700 products. The girls estimated it would take 10 hours to do that by hand.

Seeing my previous success with automation, do some programming magic on the script to automate it? I told him I had never done MEL scripting (ed: Maya's scripting language) but I'd give it a shot.

I quickly realized I was in way over my head. Fixing the script would require understanding how it worked and it was *massive*. I abandoned it and focused instead on the end result. You see

So I glanced over it and it was full of definitions like this:

So, which he'd figured out how to use competently enough. Through an unimportant process of events earlier in the year, he had purchased a pre-built machine and had me install it (essentially just plug it in, remove the bloatware that came with it, and install office). I had it set up so that at all he had on his desktop was word, outlook, and IE  ( I tried to switch him to chrome but the different look confused him and he didn't want to take the time to learn it

Unfortunately, I knew this wasn't going to be good. I tried to recreate whatever issues he was facing so i opened up IE and was immediately greeted by one of those ""super search now etc..."" add ons that pop out and take up half of your page, lovely. At this point I realize hes probably messed this machine up so bad that I'd rather fix it at my place, so I let him know that I was going to take it home and "" make it be like how it was when I set it up for him"". cue my deepest fear, "" oh no, don't do that"" he said ""I just paid somebody to fix it.""

YOU WHAT?

""yeah"" he explained ""a thing came up saying i had a bunch of errors but they could fix it

A few days ago I received a frantic call from a doctor... below is a fairly accurate transcript of the call (I recorded it with my call-taking program as he became belligerent right off the bat and listened to it later with my supervisor). I apologize for the block of text but it's burned into my head so I'll give the entire conversation rather than a summary. Feel free to skip to the bottom for a TL;DR.

Doc: I can't log in. You need to fix it for me.

Me: Okay

Doc: I can't view images. It's not letting me log in and I need to log in right now. I have a patient with me

Me: Images? Okay so are these [Clinical Program 1] documents?

Doc: No. No. It's not that. Xray images. You need to fix it so I can log in.

Me: Okay

Doc: Yes. And this is ridiculous

Me: Right. Well we can reset it for you and...

Doc: I don't need a reset. You need to fix the program. There's something wrong

Me: Well I apologize for any inconvenience but a reset should get you right in.

Doc: Fine but I want someone to look into why it won't take my password.

Me: [Wishing I could tell him it's because he doesn't *know* his password...] Definitely

He answers all my requests for his name, etc.

[Edit: I didn't get his username, we don't have access or even accounts for that system so I have no idea what the standard format is nor the # of characters...]

Me: Alright well let me send this over to our [Imaging System] Analyst so they can reset that for you.

Doc: What? No

Me: Right. Well I'm going to give this ticket to the team responsible for that system so that they can...

Doc: No

Me: I understand

Doc: I don't think you **understand.** I can't wait on this. Why won't you reset it for me now?

Me: Because I can't. I don't have that ability.

Doc: Why? Why can't you just reset it? You reset passwords all the time!

Me: We do but I don't have access for this system.

Doc: What

Me: Because we administrate *hundreds* of programs in IT sir and the Help Desk does not work on them all. [Program] is one of the many which we don't even have a login for. So let me just send this over to the analysts...

Doc: No. That's not what you're going to do. *What you're going to do* is give me the phone number of the person who fixes this

Me: [Furious at being told that I should disregard multiple policies as well as go directly against our workflow *and* give out internal numbers so that an angry doctor can get priority because he forgot his password

Doc: [angry laugh] You obviously aren't listening to what I'm saying. I'm going to have to take this somewhere. I'm sure Dr. [Person] (the president of our IT group) would love to hear why you're refusing me service.

Me: [pausing again] I'm going to send this ticket on

Doc: Fine. That will work.

Me: Is that okay?

Doc: Yes.

At this point I am, hoping that they won't ignore those as well... and then I receive a call back. Analyst A has called me back, unhappy that I'm calling for a simple password reset. Doctor Anger has been on hold for a few minutes now and I see the light stop blinking as he hangs up the line. Analyst A gives me the doctor's username and a new provisional password; I thank him. Analyst B calls up and I explain that the situation is now fixed. Time to call back Dr. Hissyfit.

Doc: Yes?

Me: It's War_Whale from the Help Desk. I have your password.

Doc: You told me thirty seconds. I was on hold for five minutes.

Me: Yes

Doc: What is it.

Me: Okay so the new password is ""Welcome1."" Capital double-you on that and the numeral one. Try that for me.

Doc: ..... no. [exasperated sigh] It doesn't *work.*

Me: Give it one more try for me.

Doc: But I'm telling you... no. It's **not working.** Did you even reset it?

Me: So we're typing ""Welcome1"" correct? Caps lock is off

Doc: This is silly. Yes. Yes

Me: And your username is... ?

Doc: ""flastname."" My first initial and last name. ""flastname""

Me: [stifling a torrent of laughter that wipes out the past 10 minutes of awfulness] No.

Doc: What?

Me: No. It's not that. You have too many letters.

Doc: ...

Me: It's ""flastnam."" Leave off the ""e."" Your username doesn't have the last ""e."" It has *never* had the ""e"" because your last name is fairly long. Usernames cut off after so many characters. [I'll admit, ""flastnam"" and ""Welcome1"" for me?

Doc: ...... thank you. [CLICK]

I'm not primarily a system administrator. I instead work as a developer that works on various ongoing projects when they approach their due dates to go out into the world and maintain them once they do. Part of this does entitle me to some sysadmin work when tickets for software float to my level though the only access I really get is to the source code (which entitles me to tell people that they're wrong about using the software when they are and they cannot do a thing about it).

So a few days back I'm working double time to meet some crazy deadlines for another project when my e-mail box gets one that reads ""Ticket for Software-X 9999999"" from the helpdesk e-mail provided to the tier above me. Normally I'd be happy to look at it but I was a bit stressed from doing other things and having QA teams pinging me every 5 minutes interrupting my work. I took a look at it and it read:

User is encountering a 403 error when accessing the application

Okay no big deal and an easy fix. That means they don't have the right access roles or their account is messed up. I told them to check the roles and if they set them right and to redo it if they need to.  Fast forward to yesterday and even more stressed out since the due date for new implementations on the other project was upon us and another e-mail comes in with the same ticket number.  This time it read:

We had the other support guys check and they swear they have the correct roles. They told the client having issues to check and compare her account with her coworkers (which was the wrong one to check BTW). The client had responded back stating that everything was right and that we're the ones wrong. The support desk told me they only checked the roles and asked for more troubleshooting help

Bit annoyed at the tone the e-mail was taking but it wasn't that bad. Knowing the source code

About 10 minutes later the security guy responds back with this golden line:

""Account does not exist in the subsystem. Please create it with the right roles""

My mind back-flipped and landed on the desk. How could they even check and verify the correct roles on a non-existent account? Sounds to me the the front most tier isn't doing their job properly.

TLDR: Help desk ticket reaches the developer tier of support because they couldn't properly go through the process of account creation for the user.",,t5_2sfg5,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1j5tke/of_course_i_set_the_roles_its_a_code_issue/

I used to work on front-end issues in 3rd line support for a software company based in the UK that sells trading software to all the big global Tier 1 investment banks. We have lots of smaller (investment funds) customers as well. 


You'd be suprised how many people working at those smaller investment companies don't know what version of Windows their running, while making a lot more money than us. But one of my best Tales did not so much question his technical ability as his job competance in the financial sector! So here it goes... 


The user who had an issue was a remote user based in Dubai. Which means he was a customer of one of our customers (let's call our customer MoneyMakers plc.) Basically we allow MoneyMakers plc. to sell our software to their customers. This makes it a bit harder to trouble shoot as the ticket comes from MoneyMakers plc. and we can not pull log-files remotely etc.. 


The user was complaining that his '1 day chart', because his other charts (e.g. one week, one month), were working fine. The software, data request/replies and permissions for those work all the same, and we didn't find anything wrong with any of those on our test or live systems. 
Because the user was in Dubai and communication reached us through MoneyMakers plc.


When I was about to read the content of the ticket

I immediately phoned up the user around 17:26 his local time

I immediately replicated the steps to replicate the issue on one of our test systems with an arbirary UK stock to produce a similar log-file to compare for differences. When I was comparing the two

Okay. I got this. Probably just no power getting to the antenna.

I have pink follow the cable from the router towards the wall where it comes in from the external antenna on the roof of her home. Halfway there she finds a little box which sends power to the antenna. (POE)

Sure enough

I send a tech with a new POE. He installs it easily enough, dangling from the attic vent is a frayed cable.

---  

So after I'd made [such a good impression on my boss](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/s68b1/chapter_2_in_which_i_make_a_first_impression/)

This is not that story.  

*This* story is about the documentation that the Helpdesk I'd just started working for had. Or, no wiki, no spreadsheets or databases of various equipment, no nothing. And their ticketing system was mainframe-based: information went in, but it was all plain text, non-searchable except by userID, and with no asset functions.  

So I started keeping notes.  

Eventually, then gargantuan. And they had started to attract the usual debris - useful EXE files, scripts I threw together to automate various things and check information for me, that sort of stuff. So I created a subfolder deep on a little-used server, off one of the near-root-level folders that users couldn't generally access, and dumped everything there. Then I took a step back, created a logical structure of references, wrote an index reference explaining what everything was and what it all did

   
Thus it was written, and the contents as the X-Files, mainly because if we encountered something bizarre, that's where we documented it. And by ""we"" I mean ""me"", as none of the rest of the techs ever contributed a damn thing.  

Anyway.  

The spreadsheet with all the quick fixes grew, and started getting referred to as the Support Bible. Which made my first iteration, of course, Genesis. Genesis expanded further, and eventually turned into version 2, then version 3, and eventually 3.04g (for gold version). 3.04g was... special. It was written to be the Ultra-Complete Maximegalon Dictionary of Every Fix Ever, and the changes wrought upon it meant its name could no longer be Genesis.

   
The story of *Exodus*, more than a year into the future. After the Vampire Slayer, after the doggy porn pouring out of the executive printer, and after the mind-twisting horror of Cthulhu's Desktop.  

   

All those stories, yes, That One Call. Which, of course, is a tale for another time...

While I email him the documents I decided to ask him why they're changing servers; did the old one die or did they just want an upgrade?

He sighed and started to tell me the story of what happened to the server..

The office staff came in that morning and started to power on their computers to ready to start their business day. When they tried to open our software on their workstations they received an error stating the software couldn't make a network connection to the server.

At this point they called their tech to report their network was down
Their tech drove to their office to see what has happened. When he came in he went to the server, you see, where there should have been a server was just an empty spot under a desk.

He asked them where that computer went. Their response?

I worked for a company that we will call ""The Flying Tech"". The Flying Tech was primarily an IT contractor, enters the scene.

I began working retail IT at a now-defunct store (I swear, let us not forget, the constant customers upset that we had sold them a computer that they couldn't install old windows 95 software on.

Yes

When my company decided to stop paying employees

Wrong.

Instead it got me doing retail IT for *minimum wage* at The Flying Tech.

 

**Act II: Internet History Doesn't Lie. Neither Do Your Eyes**

My first week on the job, and tells me that her sweet sweet little Jimmy's computer isn't working anymore, and she want's to know how much it's going to cost to fix it. Apparently, when someone logs into the internet, the first website that pops up is ""that dirty sinful pornography!"" And after about ten minutes of use the computer just shuts down.

I'm thinking virus. I tell her I can take the system in for our standard diagnostic fee, she says OK, and I tell her I'll call her back once I've confirmed.

I set the computer down, and when I return to that one the system is off. Odd.

So I power it back on again, can't find anything. Then I open up internet explorer. Front page is MSN. I mentally facepalm, and find a Firefox link on the desktop.

Now, I have the internet, so I've also seen some disturbing things. So right now, I am telling you that *what I saw was too disturbing to relate to people ON REDDIT*. No, it wasn't CP.

I open the bookmarks. Porn.
I look through some folders on the desktop. Porn.
This computer has close to 350gig of porn on it.

Then it clicks. This woman was on the younger side

I hit the power button again, preparing to check the fans, and see a big pile of roaches lying on the bottom of the case.

Remember that

the thickest

I recognize it immediately. See

And that particular nasty buildup was a combination of dust

This is not going to be fun. Pull the HDD, scan comes back negative.

Pick up the phone.

**Act III: All the Boring Crap**

Now, despite the fact that this is *exactly why we do the diag, then give a quote*. Normally, we will happily blow out a computer for the cost of the diagnostics fee and hand it back to the customer. But this requires much much more than that. This requires a Q-tip, a bottle of alcohol, some thermal paste, and at least an hour. Since we have freedom on pricing for ""non-standard services"" I opt to tell my customer it's going to be $100.

Naturally

""What

I get all that done

**Act IV: In which our Hero Saves the Day!**

For almost a whole semester we were having some weird problem where the RAM would be popped out of the slots. The weird thing is that it would not happen to any of the computers in my office just computers in the classes rooms. We thought it was a heating problem at first but this we very unlikely. We just lived with the problem for a while. Well one day I decided to help the new guy at the other IT department(lets call them naughty IT) with a project. Well as we were in a class room one of the computers wouldn't start because of the power supply(My department would just buy a new power supply) so this new guy just picked up the computer of the floor a few inches on its side then dropped it. I asked him what he was doing and he said that he was instructed to do this to get the power supply to work. Well damn the computer came right on but immediately gave the familiar RAM error beep code. Then he said ""naughty IT told him that better IT takes care of that"" not knowing that i was a part of better IT. 

This is why we take our inter-departmental dodgeball game to seriously",,t5_2sfg5,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1juelc/sometimes_its_the_other_it_department/
1374011360.0,1ify8b,The new helpdesk lady owns an irritating customer,,484,57,40,"I've changed companies since [my last tale](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/16msw1/its_amazing_what_people_think_is_acceptable/)

We've long had an awesome tech support lady. Let's call her ""Anne"". She's polite, and amazingly good at her job. Enough so that as the company has grown -- and with it the help desk -- she's been made a sort of Team Lead. In that position, she's helped staff up the help desk; her best find to date is the newest: Let's call her ""Beth"".

During her ""training period"" (she knows the tech, but not others, and aren't in the aggregate report. After a handful of frustrating e-mail exchanges, she figures she'd better get the customer on the phone to get to the bottom of exactly what's happening, so she can file a decent ticket with the engineering team.

Because this is her training period, give feedback, etc.  As soon as Beth introduces herself and says she's from the company's tech support desk, the customer *cuts her off* and says ""I don't like being lied to.""

Anne steps in

&gt; I don't need no PR girl hand-holding me. I just want to talk to a tech and get this resolved.

Followed by the usual exchange where Anne tries unsuccessfully to convince the customer that Beth is actually a very good tech.

Finally, you're absolutely right -- there's no excuse for deception. Let me put you on hold and get an engineer.""  (Anne is, of course, fuming at this point, thinking Beth just promised something she can't deliver.)

On hold it goes.  30s later, I've got Mr. Vadir [vah-deer] on the line to help you.""  Then she dons a [Darth Vader Voice-Changer](http://www.amazon.com/Hasbro-Darth-Vader-Voice-Changer/dp/B000231FSQ) and continues the *entire remainder of the call as Darth Vader*.

She even manages to respond to a customer's ""no

The call ends with the customer happy, and the customer none the wiser. The exec who handles help desk even got a personal email from the customer praising ""Mr. Vadir"".

THe one day he gets a panicked call from one of the ladies in the call centre that her keyboard is possessed.  When she is not looking at it

He goes

So he asks her to sit down

Sure enough characters started showing up on the screen.

He immediately realizes exactly the problem.  The lady was busty and her keyboard was very close to the edge of her desk...I am sure you can picture the rest.

I've been helping an older woman with her tech problems recently. She called me up and said ""now don't you laugh at me when you find out what I did.."".

I'm thinking she forgot her password or deleted a file or something along those lines. She tells me ""Well I don't know what I did, then RED! And I didn't know WHAT was going on! So I just shut the whole thing down, unplugged it and"" ... and what you ask? Try to guess. Go ahead. Wrong.

She tried to throw it out the fucking window!

Luckily she couldn't unhook the VGA cable because it's screwed in so after struggling with it for a bit she said she gave up and set it back down.

So I go over thinking her monitor is dead and bring an extra monitor with me. I hook it up and turn it on and there's a system recovery message. She just got a blue screen for some reason and freaked out. To confirm this I asked if she had tried turning it back on after the screen changed colors. Nope. Option number one was just throw it out the window apparently. I hooked her old monitor up and sure enough

She was convinced her computer was dead and was already in the process of buying a laptop. I'm a bit concerned now because that will actually fit through the window.
