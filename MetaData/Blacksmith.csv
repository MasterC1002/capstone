Well
first
http://www.metalwebnews.org/ftp/blacksmithscraft.pdf
Use it as you would a course manual. Start from the beginning, then do 5 to 10 more and look at the last one. Compare them. It will make you feel good trust me.

Secondly
This one is my personal favorite. It's where you get into the decorative stuff. Beautiful instructions.
http://www.metalwebnews.org/ftp/wroughtironwork.pdf

And lastly
http://www.metalwebnews.org/ftp/decorativeironwork.pdf
This book, and get to work. The finished product is judged by the instructors.

These three books are so well written that I cannot reccomend them highly enough to anyon starting out.

And as an aside, teacher.
A giant in the world of English Blacksmithing. Two of my books were autographed by him (which is why I have these PDF's printed out so I don't muck up my books).

So there you have it people. My reccomendation for the best books available to the beginning

Now this stuff
It came in sheets that were scored so you could break off small pieces. You heated the steel, and then stuck the other piece to it. It was then stuck there like a tack weld. At a red heat.
Then, and finished the weld.
That's it. 
The process is even mentioned in the Blacksmith's craft by COSIRA. Most English blacksmiths swore by the stuff.

What I would like to do, and see if it can be reproduced today.

To get this to work, the garage on my front drive:

http://i.imgur.com/aerST.jpg

So my brake drum forge is on wheels, attatch the hose then lug a 24V battery charger to power it, then run an extension cable. It blows 700CFM on full blast though, it doesn't lack for guts! I'll try to get a picture of it set up next time I'm in the shop.

This is my welding bench. It's way to tall. It's a aluminium frame with a wooden top. Really solid. That there on the bench is the work in progress of my belt grinder. Don't worry

http://i.imgur.com/P3G9R.jpg

Under the bench here I've made room for a tool table. Again

http://i.imgur.com/6boyb.jpg

This is the main workbench. Built out of timber. Really solid, this stains badly. Working on the placement of the vises. The container at the end is full of veggie oil for quenching, it's really not ideal, but it works well enough for what I do. On the bench is a bracket I made, my first ornamental project, with an anvil sign I cut that I'm going to hang outside.

http://i.imgur.com/rOvSR.jpg

This is just a quick tool rack I made out of scrap wood and a bit of steel sheet. It'll serve until I've built the tool table.

A final picture. The anvil is dragged further from the wall and it's nice and close to where the forge is when it's out.

I wish I could show you what it looked like before I requisitioned it. There was just nothing, just tons of junk that we threw in there. There's still a lot to do, and I'd be glad for your advice as to how to improve. As a student, I don't get a lot of time, nor money, so I usually have to make do with what I can scrounge, make or find cheap. Lots of rooting through scrapyards! I've only moved to the garage about 3 months ago, Sundays I either do cold work or fix up the shop. But I got a lot of it done during the school holidays. I think it's reasonably good demo of what you can do with limited space in a suburban area! Also,,False

So I decided to create a list of tools one should acquire to craft such a thing. Based on Niels Provos's excellent video series [The Serpent in the Sword](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUkYJeZtW4) I kind of wrote down everything he had

*Here it is:*

* **""Big tools""**

Metal Saw

Forge (propane forge)

Coal Forge

Power hammer

Anvil

Belt Sander

Hight temperature oven for heat treating

Ben Saw

Drill press


* **Accessories**

Set of hammers

Steel splitters (w/ hammers)

Files (lots from what i saw)

Apron

Gloves

Glasses / Mask

grinder

Plasma Welder

Torch

Vise


* **Materials**

Different type of steel

Borax

Steel Sand

Coal

Clay (for crucible)

Acid and other chemical liquids (for etching)

Quenching liquid

Clay or other stuff for coating before quenching


+ a large room (in your garden) when you can store everything and you can have high current to power all this machinery


I put everything in an [open spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvsxZ2Vgy-YqdF9ublNOMW4yZnF5clVGV0VtY1BaQnc) so that anyone can edit.

What do you think of this list? What do you think is the most important when starting?
What was your budget when you started?


I also plan on adding references and/or website where to purchase that stuff from (both in the US and in Europe)

Finally he pulled out an [iron forge, hammers, tongs, an anvil, charcoal and hooked me up with his iron and charcoal guy!

**Proposal**

&gt;The idea that is being proposed is that the members of  /r/Blacksmith that are interested in making money from blacksmithing come together to form a collective store online.
&gt;
&gt;* The store would be managed by me or other members of the business.
&gt;
&gt;* Most if not all successful sale money will be returned to the producer of the item.
&gt;
&gt;* Shipping will be the responsibility of the person who has the item. I am willing to store
&gt;
&gt;* Possibly a small % of the sales will be kept to provide advertisement
&gt;
&gt;The goal of this business is to provide a nurturing environment for /r/Blacksmith’s active smiths to sell and profit from their craft.
&gt;
&gt;This will all be based loosely on the Cooperative Business model. Principles can be found here.
&gt;
&gt;[Co-Op Principles by the National Cooperative Business Association
&gt;](http://www.ncba.coop/ncba/about-co-ops/co-op-principles)
&gt;
&gt;The actual platform that I believe we should use will be www.etsy.com or a similar website. The reasons for this is: 
&gt;
&gt;* They offer a platform for us to sell our goods that is user friendly and convenient
&gt;
&gt;* They specialize in hand crafted goods.
&gt;
&gt;* They have a large base of consumers that visit the website.
&gt;
&gt;If there are any questions about the proposal feel free to ask.

**Current Timeline and Discussions**

[This is the first thing I ever made.](http://imgur.com/ZMyW0)  It's a mixture of techniques applied to make a leaf blank (that I made too skinny), but wanted to take a break from hammering (getting limp wrist) so I didn't forge weld the two together.  This was made during free shop time with just hammer and anvil, it doesn't do anything, but I was still impressed with my efforts anyway and had a blast making it.

[Today was my first official class day and I was instructed to make these](http://imgur.com/8YIKZ) after given instructions on how to hammer properly to prevent wrist injuries.  It was an exercise on making sharp and square tapers while getting the metal as smooth as possible without using a steel brush.  I was happy because my corners are very sharp

We also were given the basics on starting a coal fire and tool preparation (shaving down hammer handles to make them more ergonomic (because bought hammer handles are WAY too big for using for hours on end), and thats all I can think of for right now.

Here is the backstory:  I moved to Charleston, Carpentry, Forged Architectural Ironwork, Plaster, Preservation Masonry, and Timber Framing).

blade length:  8 inches. 
blade made from car spring (a 1980 ford pickup)
handle from oak
crosspiece is from a piece of mild steel i got at lowe's. 
no buttcap because i haven't figured out how to do that well yet. 

process:  cooked the steel in my forge

next i clamped it in a bench vise and spent HOURS on it shaping it with a file

then i cooked it in the forge again, that step cannot be overemphasized.)  (your wife will be so pissed if you fuck this part up) at 400 degrees for 10 minutes,  then cooled it. 

next i cleaned it up again with the sandpaper, cut 4 brass dowels, and epoxy'd the whole thing together (smooth on EA 40 i think is what i used).  cooked it under a shop light for 4 hours, then used a bench grinder to rough shape, covered the blade with leather then clamped it in the bench vise, and used a variety of rasps and files to shape the grip.  finally sanded the shit out of it (increasing fineness of sandpaper, again), lastly

I finished the decorative element for the supporting post. The post itself will be 3/4"" square pipe so it will be a lot stronger (and a LOT cheaper) than the 3/4"" square stock I have in place now.

In the time since then, he is also well-connected with the local smithing scene in and around the DFW metroplex and through him you can meet many other enthusiasts and professionals in the [North Texas Blacksmiths Association](http://www.ntxba.org/).

Over the course of the introductory semester, nail headers (and more nails than I care to recall), several tongs, bick-irons, hold downs, turning forks, and learned a lot about the craft itself.  He's very good about telling you *why* you do what you're doing--not just giving you orders without context--and has been helpful (and enthusiastic!) about assisting my friends and me in setting up our own workshop.

Obviously it needs some type of stand, so does this mean I have to pick up some sort of welding torch?

Does anyone have a good resource on this? 

Also, of rail road spikes (approx 15-20 spikes) they seem to be in fairly good condition except for some rust, the bucket they were in was full of water, but I don't think they had been sitting in it long because there isn't that much rust on them. So I'm wondering how will rust effect forging with them? Should I do some sort of electrolosis to get rid of the rust first, or will the heat just burn the rust away?

1346806175.0,zd7oc,Diary of a Blacksmith : Day 3,DETERMINATOR7VEN,15,0,10,"Dear Diary

Today I fired my forge at full power for the first time. I knew that the clay coating on the walls of my forge wouldn't hold that well. But I was not expecting what happened next. That clay flaked and ditched me. I was not pleased. I removed the dried up clay in anger. 

I ran to reddit for help. I bought firebrick and fired the forge again. The ducktape that held my hair-dryer on the air blast melted. I was not pleased. 

Nevertheless

This focused air blast helped me bring a old hammer head to deep yellow when I hardly reached bright red before the addition of the firebrick. I smiled. 

I reached with my tongs and grabbed the yellow-hot hammer head. I steadied it on the anvil and started hammering. I noticed the rounded head flattening where my blows focused. Bright red. Gotta hurry. I hammered faster

As I watched the flames, patience... Is this some kind of fire-watching meditation? /r/Meditation must be laughting is ass off... 

At last! Bright yellow! Here goes! I grab the hammer head and start to pound on it. The steel barely flattens. A glancing blow sends the bright red piece of steel flying. After a short moment of terror, no, no... Don't you dare give up on me! No color... Well fuck me! I trow it back to the forge.

I sight. If my disgust for this hammer head could be used as fuel I'd have infinite coal... Back to fire watching meditation. Must focus fire. Must focus air flow. Must tape hair-dryer to air pipe. This meditation thing looks like it's working... The fireplace is almost empty. That's it for today. I'm spent. I look at the hammer head and leave it to die with the embers. 

I smell like... like smoke. I drag my barbecued ass in the shower. What's wrong with that hammerhead? I know hammers are sturdy but that one is world champ level. Yesterday I quenched that hammer. Quenching hardens steel... Well fuck my flower growing ass! That's whats wrong with my hammer! 

I have soot all up in my ears. Does that makes me a blacksmith

I have seen the link included in the banner before, which may have lead to pneumonia several weeks later. The zinc fumes may have been one part that contributed to his death, but if it was, it appears it was only one of many factors.

Melting zinc will not kill you, and wearing a proper mask, and never suffered any ills because of it. Heating zinc to past its boiling temperature to the point it vaporizes and breathing in the resulting fumes of zinc oxide will likely give you flu like symptoms for up to 48 hours. Then if you are in otherwise good health you will be fine. [OSHA](http://www.osha.gov/doc/outreachtraining/htmlfiles/weldhlth.html) will back me up on this. You will not die from metal fume fever alone, but it could, as the link demonstrates, aggravate other health issues.  

I am all for safety, and dealt with in a safe manner, but to simply tell people to never do it presents an alarmist and an inaccurate view of the real risks.  I personally would prefer to know those actual hazards, instead of erroneous information, even if it is presented with the best of intentions.

Here is my plan. I want to (very badly) pick up smithing as a hobby. I've done a lot of reading. I know how I'm going to build my forge

Now

Here is what I know. I know that I need some iron (there is plenty of iron ore on the beaches too) and I plan on extracting that from iron ore using the same furnace. I also know that I need to throw in some sand (I'm told that play sand is the best choice as it is cleaner than sand from the beach) and shards of glass to help remove impurities from the molten metal and have them pool on top of the would-be ingot. What I'm sketchy on is the details of what else I need to add to get less of an iron ingot and more of a steel Ingot. I believe its also called Wootz Steel. Some people say add some carbon

So if anyone has any experience I would **greatly** appreciate any and all information you can provide. Even if it means stringing along many different view points

The post details thoroughly the attitude and actions a blacksmith should have when hunting for that hard to find tool that he needs. You never know where you're going to find them and these rules will help improve those chances.

Basic rules: 

*ASK* if you are nice you can often get stuff with no hassles


*CHECK* those dumpsters/trash piles might just have something good this time


*TAKE* never expect something to be there when you come back (basic tools &amp; gloves &amp; a tarp for dirty stuff in the vehicle at all times)


*EXPLORE* rivers in old industrial parts of town can be a steel mine...be safe though!


*TALK* that old geezer who wants to talk your ear off---well it turns out he worked for an anvil manufacturer and tells of there being a row of anvils alongside the river bank when they closed the plant down (true tale!). A fellow selling oily car parts howdy'd me at a fleamarket. I didn't need car parts but it turns out his uncle wanted to sell an anvil---515# Fisher in mint condition for $350


*THINK* what businesses might have good stuff or come across good stuff---that knife made from a RR spike might be paid for in anvils when you make it for a scrap/junk dealer


*NEATNESS* leave the area nicer than when you arrive encourages businesses to call you to haul off good stuff to ""neaten up""


*SAFETY* gloves


and lastly *CONSTANT VIGILANCE* I once ended up getting a 125# Peter Wright anvil and a 6"" post vise cause I noticed the vise leaning against a barn while doing a test drive on a car we were buying... I always ask folks with ""barn junk"" at the fleamarket about the heavy stuff they didn't bring...I spotted a keg down in the ditch near a RR crossing on the way to a smithing meeting---2/3 full of new HC spikes they were not willing to haul it back up the hill when they cleaned up after redoing the crossing---we were. Coming back from a Dr's visit the summer I had pneumonia I got my wife to stop the car and let me pick up the sledgehammer alongside the road---took me 1/2 and hour to catch my breath.

How would I go about getting started and being able to craft some simple stuff? I've seen a lot of people posting about the forges they've made... could anybody link a good resource or instruction on how to build one? I know to people who can do it, and advice from someone who's done it regarding good sources would be truly appreciated.

I live in the Houston area, really) may be pretty difficult. I'm looking at this as a hobby, I want to be able to do it in off-time, but not really looking for something that will overtake mounds of time or have a very high start-up cost (hundreds)... If smithing isn't something that can be done like that, I'd still appreciate that advice, I may just need to look for something simpler.

Questions:
    
     1. What are the most common kinds of metal you work with (be technical)?
     2. Are there any different styles/methods of blacksmithing?
     3. How does science have a part in blacksmithing?
     4. Is art a big part of blacksmithing? How has science affected it?
     5. What are the different effects of the different temperatures when tempering metal?
     6. Is blacksmithing a well paying job?
     7. Is there a lot of math involved in the shaping and heating of the metal you use?
     8. Chemically
     9. Does it matter how you hit the metal? Does it have any effect on the final product (and why)?
     10. What are some of the best pieces you have made (please include some pictures if possible)?


These are the questions, the topic is ""Blacksmithing: An Art and a Science"", so if you answer try and focus on those two specifically(art and science).

You CAN use poor quality steel to forge.  Wall sconces and J hooks can be made out of rebar and mild steel.  

Make sure you comprehend basic safety and then experiment.  Experimentation and a willingness to fail only make success in this hobby that much better.

1. How much thicker than 2"" of flat stock should i get? Can i get by with buying 2""s of it or should i find a 3"" flat stock?

2. Looking on amazon and most of the flat stocks say ""Oil Hardened"". Does this mean its already hardened or is meant to be hardened? I'm looking to harden it myself so i'm guessing it wouldn't be want I want.

Bronze is very temperamental.  Forge it too hot, let it cool to red before you try forging it.

It's a non-ferrous metal, but you can feel this happen and you'll know when to put it back in the forge.  

When forging bronze

Silicon bronze is available hard or half-hard

Is there something that should absolutely be avoided? Is there something to look for? My main concerns is whether a knife will be durable/sharp

Should I be saving up for $100 knives/swords that look the same as a $20 one? Should I care if it's damascus steel vs. anything else?
