**Columbine: Whose Fault Is It?**

*by Marilyn Manson*

http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/columbine-whose-fault-is-it-19990624

It is sad to think that the first few people on earth needed no books, the only motivation he needed was his own human disposition to violence. Whether you interpret the Bible as literature or as the final word of whatever God may be, Christianity has given us an image of death and sexuality that we have based our culture around. A half-naked dead man hangs in most homes and around our necks, and we have just taken that for granted all our lives. Is it a symbol of hope or hopelessness? The world's most famous murder-suicide was also the birth of the death icon -- the blueprint for celebrity. Unfortunately, for all of their inspiring morality, nowhere in the Gospels is intelligence praised as a virtue.

A lot of people forget or never realize that I started my band as a criticism of these very issues of despair and hypocrisy. The name Marilyn Manson has never celebrated the sad fact that America puts killers on the cover of Time magazine, since their inception, have turned criminals into folk heroes. They just created two new ones when they plastered those dipshits Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris' pictures on the front of every newspaper. Don't be surprised if every kid who gets pushed around has two new idols.


We applaud the creation of a bomb whose sole purpose is to destroy all of mankind, or maybe even participate in it, like their violent car chase of Princess Di. Disgusting vultures looking for corpses, exploiting, fucking, filming and serving it up for our hungry appetites in a gluttonous display of endless human stupidity.


When it comes down to who's to blame for the high school murders in Littleton, and we're the ones who tune in and watch the up-to-the-minute details of what they do with them. I think it's terrible when anyone dies, especially if it is someone you know and love. But what is more offensive is that when these tragedies happen, most people don't really care any more than they would about the season finale of Friends or The Real World. I was dumbfounded as I watched the media snake right in, not missing a teardrop, interviewing the parents of dead children, televising the funerals. Then came the witch hunt.


Man's greatest fear is chaos. It was unthinkable that these kids did not have a simple black-and-white reason for their actions. And so a scapegoat was needed. I remember hearing the initial reports from Littleton, since they were dressed in black. Of course, speculation snowballed into making me the poster boy for everything that is bad in the world. These two idiots weren't wearing makeup, and they weren't dressed like me or like goths. Since Middle America has not heard of the music they did listen to (KMFDM and Rammstein, among others), the media picked something they thought was similar.


Responsible journalists have reported with less publicity that Harris and Klebold were not Marilyn Manson fans -- that they even disliked my music. Even if they were fans, Jim Jones? Do you think entertainment inspired Kip Kinkel, or should we blame the fact that his father bought him the guns he used in the Springfield, Oregon, murders? What inspires Bill Clinton to blow people up in Kosovo? Was it something that Monica Lewinsky said to him? Isn't killing just killing, regardless if it's in Vietnam or Jonesboro, Arkansas? Why do we justify one, isn't he old enough to be held personally responsible for what he does with his car or gun? Or if he's a teenager


America loves to find an icon to hang its guilt on. But, and people tend to associate anyone who looks and behaves differently with illegal or immoral activity. Deep down, most adults hate people who go against the grain. It's comical that people are naive enough to have forgotten Elvis, Jim Morrison and Ozzy so quickly. All of them were subjected to the same age-old arguments, scrutiny and prejudice. I wrote a song called ""Lunchbox,"" and some journalists have interpreted it as a song about guns. Ironically, the song is about being picked on and fighting back with my Kiss lunch box, metal lunch boxes were banned because they were considered dangerous weapons in the hands of delinquents. I also wrote a song called ""Get Your Gunn."" The title is spelled with two n's because the song was a reaction to the murder of Dr. David Gunn


The somewhat positive messages of these songs are usually the ones that sensationalists misinterpret as promoting the very things I am decrying. Right now, depression, car crashes? We live in a free country, but with that freedom there is a burden of personal responsibility. Rather than teaching a child what is moral and immoral, right and wrong, we first and foremost can establish what the laws that govern us are. You can always escape hell by not believing in it, but you cannot escape death and you cannot escape prison.


It is no wonder that kids are growing up more cynical; they have a lot of information in front of them. They can see that they are living in a world that's made of bullshit. In the past, there's nowhere to run. People are the same everywhere. Sometimes music, movies and books are the only things that let us feel like someone else feels like we do. I've always tried to let people know it's OK, or better, if you don't fit into the program. Use your imagination -- if some geek from Ohio can become something, why can't anyone else with the willpower and creativity?


I chose not to jump into the media frenzy and defend myself, because their coverage of the event was some of the most gruesome entertainment any of us have seen.


I think that the National Rifle Association is far too powerful to take on, and I wouldn't want it to. I'm a controversial artist, one who dares to have an opinion and bothers to create music and videos that challenge people's ideas in a world that is watered-down and hollow. In my work I examine the America we live in, and I've always tried to show people that the devil we blame our atrocities on is really just each one of us. So don't expect the end of the world to come one day out of the blue -- it's been happening every day for a long time.

The band formed with original members kiedis, and jack irons (the first 3 named having met at Fairfax High School in California), but irons and slovak were in a band called What is This? at the time RHCP was ready to record their first album. Initially filled in to play at a bar for just 5 minutes, RHCP took to the stage, performing one song, ""Get up and jump."" Kiedis, was given the mic by his musical friends (with no intention of ever being involved with music), a self titled one. Here it is.

*Kind of a grungy funk rock.*

Favorite Moments: The beautiful twangy intro of ""Mommy Where's Daddy."" The dirty guitar riffs or ""Buckle Down"" and ""Green Heaven

Fan Favorite: True Men Dont Kill Coyotes

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuKVvsY2yfA - Get Up and Jump



**1985: Freaky Styley**


 The band (now with Slovak in for Jack Sherman who got booted from the band to make room for the founding guitarist even when he didnt want to go) was seen as having some potential here. Their new management asked who they wanted to produce their next album. They came up with an idea of getting P-Funk legend George Clinton. And he agreed! A funky album ensued.

**(Kiedis, Hillel Slovak)**

*Purely a funk rock album.*

Top 3: If You Want Me to Stay

Fan Favorite: Catholic School Girls Rule

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7pdKH2HvQo - The Brothers Cup


http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtnu9WqT8I - If You Want Me to Stay



**1987: Uplift Mofo Party Plan**

The band was rocking now. Not quite ""famous"" yet, but drugs were becoming a problem now too. They were JACKED on shit recording Freaky Styley, most notably cocaine, but Slovak was starting to lose himself to heroin. Still, this 3rd album was something rocking, and the RHCP sound that stayed around for the next 10 years or so was formed (ie Mothers Milk, Blood sugar sex magik). Martinez was let go (against his will) to bring in founding drummer Jack Irons.


*Becoming more of a rock oriented act, great stuff.*

My favorite moments: Group vocals on Backwoods, and Me and My Friends. The alternate title of ""Special Secret Song Inside"" is ""Party on Your P****.""

Top 3: Behind the Sun

Fan Favorite: Me and My Friends

**(Kiedis, Jack Irons. The original crew did this ONE album)**

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4fZJHZyMMU - Backwoods


http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMWM8gY6EzU - Fight Like a Brave (music video)


**1988-1989**: the death of Hillel Slovak, and **Mother's Milk**.


Slovak overdosed on heroin in 1988. The band devastated, and was a guitar phenom. He audtitioned for another band (Thelonious Monster - Bob Forrest gave him the job too) but Kiedis and Flea caught John after the audition and said ""you MUST come to the peppers."" John said that would be a no brainer if they were serious. They were. The band auditioned 30 drummers after that and hired the last guy to show up, Chad Smith, a heavy metal looking guy, one they thought just from outward appearance would be worth nothing to them, but he blew their faces off within minutes. They put out Mother's Milk within the next year, 1989. 

**(Kiedis, Smith)**

Favorite moments: A bass solo followed by a guitar solo all banged out over the audio of a woman uncontrollably moaning in the background. Nobody Weird Like Me's outro. Sexy Mexican Maid has no chorus

Top 3: Good Time Boys

Fan Favorite: Higher Ground

*Now more alt-rock than ever, Sexy Mexican Maid, Punk Rock Classic. A great, fun, flawless record.*

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Snnft07A3aQ - Nobody Weird Like Me


**1991**: Then they put out **Blood Sugar Sex Magik**. I assume that every person on r/music has heard this album front to back, the band was huge. So huge that Frusciante left the band while touring and descended into a 6 year heroin/coke/crack binge.

**Watch the documentary ""Funky Monks"" for a behind the scenes look at the recording of this record at ""The Mansion"" in the Hollywood Hills.**


(Kiedis, Smith)


*Gonna call this funk rock all day. Naked in the Rain. I could've Lied...*

Favorite Moments: The whole album front to back is nasty. Every song a Flea, ferocity, and originality.

Top 3: If You Have to Ask

Fan Favorites: Under the Bridge


http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTrD9HSqxV4 - My Lovely Man (A tribute to Slovak)


**1995: One Hot Minute**

With John gone, but was MUCH too sick). They made ""One Hot Minute."" It was commercially not close to being as successful as BSSM, but it brought out some great tunes, though the band was in a dark state. Drugs were still very present. Navarro was fired after touring, though with strong intentions of them all still carrying on as RHCP, due to cocaine problems and lack of chemistry.

**(Kiedis, Dave Navarro)**

Favorite moments: The second half of the song ""Coffee Shop"" has an insane instrumental break in the middle

Top 3: Warped

Fan Favorite: Aeroplane 


*Navarro brought a metal-y grunge to the peppers. Clearly heard in songs like Warped, but Dave was great.*

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1MwPDtPjbs - Walkabout 


**1999: CALIFORNICATION**


Frusciante had gone to rehab to save his life in 1997. His arms were scarred up and down from incorrect needle usage. All of his teeth were gone and he got new implants put in because the original ones just rotted away. There are famous videos on Youtube of him just beyond plastered on many chemicals. It was a miracle he made it through. Flea went to John's house one day and asked if he wanted to come back.


By now, but coming more into what they will become and starting to really hit on what I mentioned earlier, instrumental precision and flawless works of art.


**(Kiedis, Smith)** by now, the *CLASSIC* lineup

Favorite Moments: The monstrous outros of Parallel Universe

Top 3: Around the World

Fan Favorite: Scar Tissue

*Now purely an alternative rock sound, etc.*

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiqSl0bfWro - This Velvet Glove


http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3sNSWbeTCU - Savior (live) solo around 4 minutes



**2002 - 2008**


RHCP is now huge. Regarded as one of the biggest rock bands of the last 20 years


*By the Way saw the band take a different turn. One that fans adore. John wrote a ton of the album himself and by now he is basically a full time singer beside Kiedis. He wanted to make a punk record but Rick Rubin said no. John went with his second yearning and went more ""brit-pop""-y. Songs like The Zephyr Song

Favorite Moments: John and Anthony alternating chorus vocals on ""Dosed."" The bassline and guitar effects on ""Throw Away Your Television.""

Top 3: By the Way

Fan Favorite: Can't Stop


**Stadium Arcadium**. Released in **2006**. John's sendoff. An epic 28 song double album. Full of sort of sing songy tunes with hard bass lines and epic guitar solos on just about every jam like Warlocks, semi funk sound.*

Favorite Moments: Snow guitar riff. Stadium Arcadium guitar solo. Hump de Bump's mindblowing percussion breakdown, Readymade's guitar solo, and the choir of noise behind the band in the experimental ""We Believe.""

Top 6: Cmon Girl, Slow Cheetah, She's Only 18, Hard to Concentrate

Fan Favorite: Tell Me Baby


**(Kiedis, Smith)**


http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VU2kdbANwA - Minor Thing (By the Way)


http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWTEsrwY_Zs - Turn It Again (Stadium Arcadium)


http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDLSODB5dIE - Venice Queen (By the Way) *Live at Slane Castle*

**2009 - present**


John Frusciante quit the band during their 2 year hiatus after SA. They brought in longtime friend **Josh Klinghoffer** and put out **Im With You** in 2011. It had its moments,"" ""The Will to Death,"" and ""To Record Only Water for Ten Days."" Anyway, I'm With You is just another piece in RHCP's journey, a new beginning with yet another guitarist. 


**(Kiedis, Klinghoffer)**


*A lot of pop on here. Still good stuff though. Josh does extremely well. ""Monarchy of Roses"" kicks of the album in promising fashion and there are some fun African influences that can be seen at points

Favorite moments: Klinghoffer's backing vocals on ""Annie Wants a Baby

Top 3: Police Station

Fan Favorite: Ethiopia

We all miss you. Led Zeppelin never continued making insanely stoney

Your drumming was probably the funkiest hard rock drumming ever ! There are lots of fab rock drummers - but NONE could funk and groove like you do ! The Wanton Song, Houses Of The Holy ( the song ), .... Bring it On Home ... were all intense ( just to scratch the surface ) ! And when you would throw away the sticks and destroy that drum set with your hands it was pure nirvana to listen !You were a consummate professional. Never took yourself too seriously and always humble when the lads poked fun at you on stage. 

You inspired a whole generation of kids to want to slap the skins in the 70's and you still rule to this very day. Never has a drummer played on such choice tracks of an entire discography dense with works of timeless classic genius work.

Anyway - you love to party and I raise my glass with you today. Three cheers for Bonzo - the monster drummer who put four sticks in his hand - or no sticks in his hands ! Hip Hip - - Hip Hip -- Hip Hip --

Speaking from the tongue of an experienced simpleton who obviously would rather be an emasculated
All the warnings from the punk rock 101 courses over the years, ethics involved with independence and the embracement of your community has proven to be very true. I haven't felt the excitement of listening to as well as creating music along with reading and writing for too many years now. I feel guity beyond words about these things.
For example when we're back stage and the lights go out and the manic roar of the crowds begins., relish in the the love and adoration from the crowd which is something I totally admire and envy. The fact is, I can't fool you, any one of you. It simply isn't fair to you or me. The worst crime I can think of would be to rip people off by faking it and pretending as if I'm having 100% fun. Sometimes I feel as if I should have a punch-in time clock before I walk out on stage. I've tried everything within my power to appreciate it (and I do,God, believe me I do, but it's not enough). I appreciate the fact that I and we have affected and entertained a lot of people. It must be one of those narcissists who only appreciate things when they're gone. I'm too sensitive. I need to be slightly numb in order to regain the enthusiasms I once had as a child.
On our last 3 tours, but I still can't get over the frustration, the guilt and empathy I have for everyone. There's good in all of us and I think I simply love people too much, so much that it makes me feel too fucking sad. The sad little, sensitive, unappreciative, Pisces
I have a goddess of a wife who sweats ambition and empathy and a daughter who reminds me too much of what i used to be, self-destructive, death rocker that I've become.
I have it good, but since the age of seven, I've become hateful towards all humans in general. Only because it seems so easy for people to get along that have empathy. Only because I love and feel sorry for people too much I guess.
Thank you all from the pit of my burning, and so remember, it's better to burn out than to fade away.
Peace

Please keep going Courtney

People have argued that it's because their lyrics are derivative, has a much more prosaic origin. An overplayed Comedy Central promo.  


Comedy Central advertised the hell out of *[Tough Crowd With Colin Quinn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tough_Crowd_with_Colin_Quinn)* which aired from 2002-2004.  It was a panel comedy show featuring 4 comedians (and Colin Quinn as host) discussing topical news stories.  One of their promos (I cannot find a video of the promo

&gt;&gt;""No one talks about the studies that show that bad music makes people violent

This joke was on every Tough Crowd promo and nearly all the time.  After hearing this joke during every promo for a couple of weeks I began to hear everyone at my middle school begin to mock Nickelback mercilessly.  Interestingly,%20hoobastank%20sucks) at the time.   But individual jokes about Creed and Hoobastank weren't advertised as much this one for Nickelback.

The worthwhile part of that repetitive commercial was of course the punchline ""listening to Nickelback makes me want to kill Nickelback.""  The whisper-down-the-lane aspect of the joke telling

The proliferation of this joke through Comedy Central's ad machine followed by people slowly forgetting the origin of it (made easier by there not yet being YouTube in May 2003) is what made the ""Hate Nickelback"" meme prevalent.

When I look up that quote from the show verbatim [on Google](http://bit.ly/Y8i4Df)

Via [comments section on AVClub](http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-hits-keep-coming-30-songs-inspired-by-domestic

&gt;&gt;""I do think certain kinds of music can make you violent. Like

Even Dustin Dye's [blogpost defending Nickelback](http://dustindye.hubpages.com/hub/Blog-Why-the-hate-A-qualified-defense-of-Nickelback) which briefly mentions that he thinks Brian Posehn was the origin doesn't get the quote quite right.
&gt;&gt;   ...Brian Posehn's joke: ""Listening to Nickelback doesn't make me want to kill myself. Listening to Nickelback makes me want to kill Nickelback

I think that since Since Colin Quinn's Tough Crowd aired in the internet dark ages (B.Y. before YouTube, but everyone remembers some modification of the joke or idea.

As an example

&gt;&gt;""the study finally provides proof that listening to Nickelback can make you a bad person.""

**TL;DR**

1.) Poor human source memory has left hundreds of people without a direct memory of a Nickelback joke played on loop on Comedy Central for months in 2003.

2.) Since Colin Quinn's Tough Crowd has never officially been released

3.) The Comedy Central audience are exactly young and male enough to disseminate uncredited jokes in great proportions.  (I kid

4.) Nickelback continues to tour and earn money

5.) In light of all of this,False,,t5_2qh1u,False,,,t3_18kyy4

by Marilyn Manson
http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/columbine-whose-fault-is-it-19990624

It is sad to think that the first few people on earth needed no books, the only motivation he needed was his own human disposition to violence. Whether you interpret the Bible as literature or as the final word of whatever God may be, Christianity has given us an image of death and sexuality that we have based our culture around. A half-naked dead man hangs in most homes and around our necks, and we have just taken that for granted all our lives. Is it a symbol of hope or hopelessness? The world's most famous murder-suicide was also the birth of the death icon -- the blueprint for celebrity. Unfortunately, for all of their inspiring morality, nowhere in the Gospels is intelligence praised as a virtue.

A lot of people forget or never realize that I started my band as a criticism of these very issues of despair and hypocrisy. The name Marilyn Manson has never celebrated the sad fact that America puts killers on the cover of Time magazine, since their inception, have turned criminals into folk heroes. They just created two new ones when they plastered those dipshits Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris' pictures on the front of every newspaper. Don't be surprised if every kid who gets pushed around has two new idols.

We applaud the creation of a bomb whose sole purpose is to destroy all of mankind, or maybe even participate in it, like their violent car chase of Princess Di. Disgusting vultures looking for corpses, exploiting, fucking, filming and serving it up for our hungry appetites in a gluttonous display of endless human stupidity.

When it comes down to who's to blame for the high school murders in Littleton, and we're the ones who tune in and watch the up-to-the-minute details of what they do with them. I think it's terrible when anyone dies, especially if it is someone you know and love. But what is more offensive is that when these tragedies happen, most people don't really care any more than they would about the season finale of Friends or The Real World. I was dumbfounded as I watched the media snake right in, not missing a teardrop, interviewing the parents of dead children, televising the funerals. Then came the witch hunt.

Man's greatest fear is chaos. It was unthinkable that these kids did not have a simple black-and-white reason for their actions. And so a scapegoat was needed. I remember hearing the initial reports from Littleton, since they were dressed in black. Of course, speculation snowballed into making me the poster boy for everything that is bad in the world. These two idiots weren't wearing makeup, and they weren't dressed like me or like goths. Since Middle America has not heard of the music they did listen to (KMFDM and Rammstein, among others), the media picked something they thought was similar.

Responsible journalists have reported with less publicity that Harris and Klebold were not Marilyn Manson fans -- that they even disliked my music. Even if they were fans, Jim Jones? Do you think entertainment inspired Kip Kinkel, or should we blame the fact that his father bought him the guns he used in the Springfield, Oregon, murders? What inspires Bill Clinton to blow people up in Kosovo? Was it something that Monica Lewinsky said to him? Isn't killing just killing, regardless if it's in Vietnam or Jonesboro, Arkansas? Why do we justify one, isn't he old enough to be held personally responsible for what he does with his car or gun? Or if he's a teenager

America loves to find an icon to hang its guilt on. But, and people tend to associate anyone who looks and behaves differently with illegal or immoral activity. Deep down, most adults hate people who go against the grain. It's comical that people are naive enough to have forgotten Elvis, Jim Morrison and Ozzy so quickly. All of them were subjected to the same age-old arguments, scrutiny and prejudice. I wrote a song called ""Lunchbox,"" and some journalists have interpreted it as a song about guns. Ironically, the song is about being picked on and fighting back with my Kiss lunch box, metal lunch boxes were banned because they were considered dangerous weapons in the hands of delinquents. I also wrote a song called ""Get Your Gunn."" The title is spelled with two n's because the song was a reaction to the murder of Dr. David Gunn

The somewhat positive messages of these songs are usually the ones that sensationalists misinterpret as promoting the very things I am decrying. Right now, depression, car crashes? We live in a free country, but with that freedom there is a burden of personal responsibility. Rather than teaching a child what is moral and immoral, right and wrong, we first and foremost can establish what the laws that govern us are. You can always escape hell by not believing in it, but you cannot escape death and you cannot escape prison.

It is no wonder that kids are growing up more cynical; they have a lot of information in front of them. They can see that they are living in a world that's made of bullshit. In the past, there's nowhere to run. People are the same everywhere. Sometimes music, movies and books are the only things that let us feel like someone else feels like we do. I've always tried to let people know it's OK, or better, if you don't fit into the program. Use your imagination -- if some geek from Ohio can become something, why can't anyone else with the willpower and creativity?
I chose not to jump into the media frenzy and defend myself, because their coverage of the event was some of the most gruesome entertainment any of us have seen.

I think that the National Rifle Association is far too powerful to take on, and I wouldn't want it to. I'm a controversial artist, one who dares to have an opinion and bothers to create music and videos that challenge people's ideas in a world that is watered-down and hollow. In my work I examine the America we live in, and I've always tried to show people that the devil we blame our atrocities on is really just each one of us. So don't expect the end of the world to come one day out of the blue -- it's been happening every day for a long time.

Their discography *is* quite large and can be intimidating


**Sad Sappy Sucker** (2001)

NOTICE: This is *NOT* the first album that Modest Mouse released. I include it here

This is Modest Mouse at its crudest, music emphasizing Brock's ever-angsty voice. Has some flashes of Phil Elvrum.

Solid album


**This is a Long Drive For Someone With Nothing to Think About** (1996)

This is where it starts to pick up. *TIALD...* begins to build the band's signature guitarwork and musical duality. Modest Mouse's intriguing balance between screamo-angst and melodious-pensive-lo fi music starts here. This balance really defines their entire career

* [Dramamine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TK1bi4emEkk)

* Also check out [Custom Concern](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQC4XbYvHUo) and one of my personal favorites [Talking Shit about a Pretty Sunset](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CH1Tu9-oSU). 


**Interstate 8** (1996)

An EP that was released on the heels of *TIALD...*


**The Lonesome Crowded West** (1997)

Here it is, like [Trailer Trash](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjecIllOEio), are written with an authentic vulnerability that brings you into this feeling of alienation and loneliness. The duality is strong here, often bubbling up within the same song, as in Cowboy Dan and [Styrofoam Boots](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li30NxCsJ7w). Still other songs (i.e. Trucker's Atlas) are just as sprawling and monotonous as the open road.

This album is incredibly diverse

* Seriously

* [Heart Cooks Brain](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2qgEl4KWB4) was the ""single.""

* [Cowboy Dan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBjiYZiv5RE) is always my favorite to see them perform live. 


**Building Nothing Out of Something** (2000)

A compilation album that throws together some songs from throughout their career. It's a hodge-podge, vulnerable, geeky, and, crucially, sweet.""

* [Broke](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dlqgijgd3d0) and [Interstate 8](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ze3rjQ7jG0). 


**The Moon &amp; Antarctica** (2000)

The breakthrough album. *TM&amp;A* was what truly thrust MM into the limelight, more angsty side and still reach the level of lyric depth that appeared in *The Lonesome, Crowded West*. The result was a more polished, emotional, vulnerable, thought-provoking album. 

Lyrically, this album takes us for a ride, fluxing from the neat guitarwork and vintage MM sound of the first two tracks into the dreamy, otherworldly passage that comes in the middle, launching you into the stars for songs like The Cold Part and Alone Down There.

Many say that *The Moon &amp; Antarctica* is not only MM's best album

This is an album that you simply have to listen to in its entirety. I would not be doing you or MM justice if I told you otherwise. That said

* [Third Planet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsnELWjsCsA)

* [Gravity Rides Everything](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6XhVj5GF0I)

* [Tiny Cities Made of Ashes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EA5b3FNI4w)--kickass song

* [...but LISTEN TO THE WHOLE ALBUM!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQSVqCTfFtk)


**Everywhere and His Nasty Parlour Tricks** (2001)

A nice, but if you're into Modest Mouse's sound this is the still-fresh Brock with some muddled musings. 

* I especially dig the sweet lyrics on [You're the Good Things](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-e18snsF3U) and the down-home folk sound of [3 Inch Horses

**Good News For People Who Love Bad News** (2004)

This is a big one. Four years after the release of *TM&amp;A*, *Good News* was MM's first (and only) album to go platinum in the United States. It features the band's most recognizable song, Float On. Many of these songs are excellent, and explode into unforgettable riffs of raw, MM brilliance (see Black Cadillacs and Bukowski).  The album makes a marked turn towards the away from the ether and towards the terrestrial sphere, about the pragmatic aspects of life and our mentalities towards it. ""If life's not beautiful without the pain,"" Brock croons in The View

There is certain beauty to this album. It is the most accessible of MM's work, it lacks the fluency of its two LP predecessors. The songs on *Good News* seem like contained units. This album is not quite able to cohere in the dualism of *TLCW* or in the ethereal exploration of *TM&amp;A*.

The hits:

* [Float On](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTAud5O7Qqk)

* [The World At Large](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNxa9pFwimk)

* [Ocean Breathes Salty](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPhnOKmhbBw)

Other good ones:

* [The View](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPofScjGh7g)

* [The Good Times are Killing Me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL1cRSRUUZQ)--accessible

**We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank** (2007)

The tides continue to change for MM. With the free-agency pickups of Johnny Marr (former Smiths guitarist), MM retooled and came up with another album brimming with several songs worthy of the top of the charts. Throughout, though, Brock maintained his true influence and his helming of the band. His high-angst yells still make it through in songs like Education and We've Got Everything, though they sound a bit more forced than in his teenage harangues a decade before. The real beauty of this album comes in the hits themselves, like Fire it Up and Missed the Boat, where simplicity and outlook are everything. And as Brock ages, I'll say that his anger

The hits:

* [Dashboard](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=penvn9VL32Y)

* [Missed the Boat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSfTdzoO4ic)

* [Fire it Up](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLfFBj1Vk4U)

Others:

* [Little Motel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqQTODR3kR8)


**No One's First and You're Next** (2009)

Modest Mouse's latest release, including Brock's now-signature course yells. Still, there is some branching out. In [Satellite Skin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am8pPOFJi9g), you get a sound that picks up on more contemporary alt music than MM's earlier repertoire. 

* [King Rat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qi7KDOAj4Xo)-- a rollicking, banjo and Brock's throaty musings.

* [The Whale Song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_pnlYYHO1g)--makes me feel a bit psychotic in the good way

I thought it was a very interesting read. I missed a lot of the subtext myself. 

[EDIT] Whee! Front page of r/music! Thanks for the comments

My dad teaches at Korea University in Seoul every summer for their international summer campus. While he was over there Gangnam Style went viral and I asked him if it was as big in Korea as it was over here. He said that he's heard it on the radio and seen the video on TVs and such. He also mentioned that the students at the university mostly just laughed it off and thought of it as a fun song. My mom, she really doesn't understand how wasteful the youth can be in the sake of appearances. ",,False,,t5_2qh1u,1345858277.0,,

Ok, My father put out the second most popular country song ever. I think that solidifies his claim to be a one hit wonder.

In 1990 a woman that he was married to for 3 years shot and killed him in his garage as he was trying to leave. I was on that TV show called A Current Affair as well as numerous newspaper interviews following the murder. Ultimately she was not convicted of the murder. She also burned down the house they were living in for the insurance money. Here is the longshot request. Would any of you fine people have, pictures or any type of memorabilia of my father? I have almost nothing but a few scant pictures to remember him by. Even if this post nets me but one single picture, you have no idea how grateful me and my sister would be to have it.

Again I thank you for your time.

Edit: Several redditors have given me some good leads. I knew I could count on reddit! For example

Edit 2: We made a facebook page for my dad. If you friend request him I promise that I will add you.

Edit 3: To all of you suggesting that I seek revenge on the woman that killed him. I have already wrestled with and defeated that demon. Even though I am 100% absolutely sure that she is guilty I cannot do this. I would be arrested immediately. I have already said on national TV that I know she did it. I promise you I would be the prime suspect. I would be totally ok with the murder investigation being reopened though.

Edit: Wow! This is overwhelming. Did not expect this response. I will try and answer the questions below as I get time. 

Thank you /u/gonnasingnow for your time on this. Sounds great so far. Gave me chills. 

Thanks to /u/composeradrian as well. He was able to use some different software to create a more realistic sound.

Edit: Here are the 2 computer generated versions so far. [https://soundcloud.com/daniel-cabin/invasion](https://soundcloud.com/daniel-cabin/invasion) and [https://soundcloud.com/adrianlhernandez/invasion-intro](https://soundcloud.com/adrianlhernandez/invasion-intro)  

I have a few messages from people who are planning live recordings I will update with them when I receive them. This is so amazing to get this reaction. I thank you all. 

Looks like it was made in 1956 for all those interested.

Edit: I cannot wait to hear any live versions that people may come up with. I wanted my Dad to see how awesome this has been over the past day

Here it is:

Thank you all for bringing to life the only known music composition created by my father.

My father went to college

My father was a kind and caring person and two things that I never heard was he never mentioned anything about the war and I never heard him play any music. 

After Dad passed away in 1995 I found a box of his military history and photographs that he took during the war. They were not your normal pictures of landscapes

Thank you for letting me hear my father play music after all these years and to hear through this music his feelings of what war is like and the cruelty that it can cause. 

I think this was his “Machine Gun”.

What if we had a week where every song posted to r/music must have less than 300, so that's pretty much it, if you think some form of this could be a good idea, upvote, if you think it's a bad idea, downvote. Have a nice day.

**Edit/update:** Just woke up and I'd like to say I'm surprised and grateful for the comments and upvotes, I've been trying to read through all the comments but I still have a few to go, I like what I've read so far, here are my responses:

1) I'm sure some people would try to sneak more popular songs by

2) Thanks for the suggestions of /r/listentothis and /r/under10k, because I wouldn't want it to be just underground indie bands, but also slightly 'deeper' tracks by some more popular bands, which is also part of the reason I thought of a higher number and not 25,000 or something.

3) I agree with the person or people who suggested doing it one day every week, seems like the perfect day for it. Maybe we could have the best of both and have it 3 days back to back and then every Tuesday?

About 3 pages in my printer acts like its running out of ink ( even though it shows at 75% full) and by the end of the 4th page its so blurry I can't see shit.  I reset the printer and immediately try to reprint it and get this pop up:
&gt;you have reached your print limit for this purchase

Holy fuck

That is the last $1.29 they will be getting from me and now I am probably just gonna START by checking out torrent sites first instead of taking the legal option.

Fortunately I myself have never been a victim

I had the privilege of attending one of the organizations ""Love Balls"" about six months ago

The money goes toward building the ""Be Brave Ranch"" which is a sort of camp for victims of sexual assault in which they will receive the necessary therapy and support

**I will be updating with proof of donation next week.**

Please

**IF YOU CAN SUGGEST A MORE FITTING CHARITY PLEASE DO**

Unfortunately given the size of Little Warriors I don't see it listed on Charity Navigator. I can say that the organization is morally sound to the **best of my knowledge**. That being said I am open to donating to another charity with a little more transparency. I would like to stick within the ""Victims of Sexual Assault"" umbrella though.

I am waiting for something to wrong
I am waiting for familiar resolve
I am waiting for another repeat
Another diet fed by crippling defeat
And i am waiting for that sense of relief
I am waiting for you to flee the scene
As if you held in your hand the smoking gun
And on the floor lay the one you said you loved.

And it's strange
They are basically the same
So i don't ask names anymore.

Sometimes i think this cycle never ends
We slide from top to bottom and we turn and climb again
And it seems by the time that i have figured what it's worth
The squeaking of our skin against the steel has gotten worse.

Dear /r/Music

This EP is my first release,000 and 1,200 hours on the production process–especially tweaking the mixes–over the course of a year. Then my drummer emailed me  [this story about the makers of Duke Nukem](http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/12/fail_duke_nukem/) and why they never finished their sequel. After spending a few days trying convince myself that my situation was different, I decided to pull the trigger and commit to a deadline at all costs. I spent all my savings and maxed out my credit card to take several months off from work and finish mixing (I'm self-employed). By then I'd lost most of my friends (always too busy to see them), was eating take out and convenience store food 7 days a week (too busy to shop), and had developed an immunity to Red Bull (too busy to go to sleep before 7 AM). Today, the burden is lifted. Here it is in all its imperfection or overperfection. I hope some of you get something from this.

TL;DR - five songs took five years.

I'm looking for more ""big"" music. What do you consider the most moving and/or beautiful song you have ever heard?

clarification: by big
A few other things I like in the general category

* Everwood theme (forgot this one). I went to Park City, touches the right places in my memory and I loved Everwood.
* Chevaliers de Sangreal from Angels and Demons
* Now We Are Free from Gladiator
* Coldplay's Clocks and The Scientist
* Metallica's The Ecstasy of Gold from the S&amp;M album.
* I like Edward Higginbottom's version of In paradisium and Agnus Dei Op. 11.
* Brian Eno's ""An Ending (Ascent)"" from Apollo: Atmospheres &amp; soundtracks
* Ave Maria from the OperaBabes 
* I sort of have a thing for some of Ludovico Einaudi's music - first introduced by Stargate Universe with Ascolta on Divinire. Liked some other songs from that show too.
* a fair bit of Battlestar Galactica's soundtrack
* Stargate movie theme
* Sigur Rós' Hoppípolla (thanks for remininding me!)
* Song of Freedom
* Another I remembered - The Dream Academy
* not in my main group

hell I like a lot of music way outside this particular set

I realize we all have different tastes and I thank you for all of your suggestions. I like trying new (or retrying old) things. Obviously I can't reply to everyone and it might get repetitive if I did


edit #N+1: wow- never expected so many replies. I'll be busy listening for days

edit #N+2: front-page? criminy! So many suggestions

edit #N+3: I posted this below, Beethoven, Mahler, Schubert, Barber and all kinds of things. I love that stuff, but as much as I love it, for some reason though, I have more symphonic things that may be less classical and even a few that you might consider modern. Perhaps my problem is a generally bad memory combined with being a movie nut and I've listened to music actively my whole life so maybe I've watered down my recollection a bit too much. More recent works are at the top of the stack. This whole thread is about what moves you, mainly looking for a couple new songs to put on while working today and because I'm a bit sick (just a cold).

Lil Wayne is in ICU in critical condition after suffering yet another seizure

We broke the story ... the 30-year-old rapper was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Hospital in L.A. Tuesday night after suffering multiple seizures.  He was released Wednesday but just hours later one of his bodyguards found him in his room

Wayne was rushed to the hospital again

We're told Wayne is currently ""unstable

We're told several people are at Wayne's bedside crying

Sources say there's evidence Wayne went on a Sizzurp binge after being released Wednesday

We're told Wanye's stomach was pumped 3 times to flush the drugs from his system.

Do people even discuss anything about music on this subreddit? I'm not subscribed to this subreddit so I thought if I came here and looked at the sidebar I'd be enlightened

So what do you guys actually do here? Just post to music that you like and then people will vote on it? Eventually

Then people will just start other subreddits about certain genres, it's all on YouTube so why wouldn't people just go there? 


What do you use this subreddit for? So you don't have to open up another tab to get to YouTube and basically this becomes a shuffle feature where you'll just listen to whatever is voted high enough for you to notice on your front page?

I am a huge Kanye West fan and so this is something I've always wanted to do, which I find irritating. So anyway

**The College Dropout (2004)**

This was Kanye's debut project which was released in early 2004 under Jay-Z's label, Heart of the City &amp; Izzo (Hova), the latter of which was a mega hit on the charts. The album is very soul samples heavy and was one of the first mainstream albums in rap to do away with the ""gangster"" imagine most rappers tried to portray. As an aside it took Kanye forever to get a deal because most people didn't see him as ""gangster"" enough to have any appeal as a rapper, which is of course hilarious in retrospect. 

Standout Tracks

*All Falls Down-Ye tackles racism
catchy as hell. [All Falls Down](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kyWDhB_QeI)

*Jesus Walks-He made a song about Jesus that gets played in the club. Like he did this on his debut album, could have been the end of him in rap. [Jesus Walks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYF7H_fpc-g)

*Last Call-I debated this or Family Business

**Late Registration (2005)**

This was released after the whole ""George Bush doesn't care about black people"" fiasco and it was a massive hit. Kanye continued the soul sample thing, but will likely move up as it is still only 8 years old.

Standout Tracks

*Diamonds from Sierra Leone-Along with the remix featuring Jay-Z

*Touch the Sky-Produced by a producer he came up with in Just Blaze, had the best verse on the track. [Touch the Sky](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkwQbuAGLj4) 

*Hey Mama-His mom died in 2007 (I will get in to that later!) and this song was released in 2005

**Graduation (2007)**

Some argue this is Kanye's weakest ""rap"" album

Standout Tracks

*Stronger-I kind of debated putting this here, but he specifically tried to dumb it down for the stadium appeal. [Stronger](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsO6ZnUZI0g)

*Bittersweet Poetry-A bonus track, especially at the end. I think anyone who has messed up in a relationship can understand this song. [Bittersweet Poetry](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig0GdSHDCfs)

*Can't Tell me Nothiing-This might be the one song that defines Kanye the most. The first line is ""I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven, Adam Eve wear Nada I'm in between but may more fresher,"" that line is classic Kanye. [Can't Tell me Nothing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E58qLXBfLrs)

**808s &amp; Heartbreak**

In 2007 right after the release Graduation, Kanye sung with the help of autotune to make him sound almost robotic and emotionless as if someone had ripped his heart out. This is one of my favorite Kanye albums though, it has a dark, emotionless and sad feel to it. You really get the feeling of a guy who just had his world flipped upside down. It helped to launch the careers of Kid Cudi and Drake among others.

Standout Tracks

*Welcome to Heartbreak-This may be my favorite Kanye song. The Kid Cudi vocals on the hook are perfect for the song

*Coldest Winter-Backed by a sample from Tears for Fears, the way the autotune works and the lyrics, the whole thing is just so sad. [Coldest Winter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6rjQ9VVLDI)

*Pinnchio Story-Not technically a song more of a freestyle

**My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010)**

In 2009, the VMA Taylor Swift ""incident"" happened. Say what you want about it being planned etc... I don't buy it at all, but it doesn't matter. One way or the other, Kanye took a year off music lived in Japan and Italy to escape the media and then all of a sudden in May 2010 was seen in New York City, and a few days later ""Power"" was released. A lot of people expected a song where he said sorry to Taylor and sorry to Ameirca, but instead the first words we hear are; ""Living in that 21st Century, doing something mean to it/do it better then anybody you ever seen do it."" It was clear 10 seconds in

Standout Tracks

*Runaway-This is my all time favourite song. It's his song to Taylor Swift, but also with his middle finger up. The song is just beautiful and I really don't know how else to describe it other then that. [Runaway](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7_jYl8A73g)

*Gorgeous-If you like lyrical rappers, and it's hard to argue against him after hearing this song.[Gorgeous](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghc_fc4R1rI)

*Lost in the World-Kanye's verse is only 8 bars and that's all he says in the entire song. However

**Yeezus (2013)**

And now we come to his recent release, Kanye just took the box, lit it on fire and then poured the ashes in to the pacific ocean, or to say, the box does not exist with Kanye. This album has rock, EDM, rap and reggae influences and although a lot of ""old school"" rap fans dislike it

Standout Tracks

*Black Skinhead-I think they're making a video for this one

*Blood on the Leaves-this is like 808s style perfected. He uses autotune and the beat drop on this is almost a religious experience. The sample is also awesome. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0QcxWPB59o](Blood on the Leaves)

*Bound 2-If you prefer ""old"" Kanye to new Kanye this is the song for you. The beat could pass for a College Dropout leftover and lyrically there are some clever lines in there. [Bound 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0RHjDN3e0)

So this is my rundown of Kanye West's impressive discography in an hour. There are two other projects Watch the Throne with Jay-Z (2011) and Cruel Summer with GOOD Music his record label (2012) which you can check out too

I mean, ""Hey, I wonder if /r/Music has heard this?"" They would only post it for the karma, because they KNOW that people already know and like this song. People who want to listen to music they haven't heard before could go to /r/listentothis.

The only bright spot of this subreddit that I see is the Fridays where only self posts are allowed

If I'm missing the goal of this subreddit entirely, /r/Music just seems like all the karma whores in one spot.

EDIT: I received a response from Raerth (a mod) that really does help to clear this up for me:

""This is a default subreddit with 1.5 million subscribed accounts and 3 million unique visitors a month. The posts that rise to the top are those which appeal to the widest possible cross-section of those people. If you're coming here to find new, you are in the wrong place.

With something as subjective as music taste

There are plenty of subreddits that focus on music discovery. Off the top of my head are /r/listentothis , /r/headbangtothis , and /r/under10k . They have strict rules on what can be submitted.

/r/Music does not have strict rules because what is a classic for someone in /r/HiphopHeads could be unknown to someone in /r/Metal 

Also

**What we are good for is being the dump that everyone can submit any song to. There are no rules other than it being about music.

We are also the springboard for people to explore the musical subreddits. We maintain [The Big Fucking List of Music](http://www.reddit.com/r/music/faq)

I don't usually share my private stuff with the interwebz but I feel like I need to tell this one.

So not more then 30 minutes ago I was coming home driving my car, was enjoying a mix CD, volume was pretty high, but I didn't care. Songs were good... I stopped at the red light just as a song was finishing, for some reason I took a look at my rear view mirror, saw no one. Next song started and I just noticed that light turned yellow, eventually green.

I've put my right hand down to put a car into gear

As I pressed next on my CD thingey

All this happened in like 2 seconds... Me going for a gear change and going back to CD changer.

I literally stood there frozen for I don't know how long... Felt totally numb after a giant surge of adrenalin pumping trough my veins.

If that songs wasn't so damn popular

I would have probably died... We both probably would have.

So Gotye

I guess I just wasn't my time to go.

Cheers internet

**Edit: Holy shit

**Just for clarification

***This is not a karma whore post

Long story short: My mother has Angiosarcoma of the breast. A very nasty and hard to treat form of cancer. The prognosis isn't great but she's going through chemotheraphy and radiation ASAP to assault her system. 

When I visited with her this weekend she asked me to make her a playlist for her iPod that she can listen to while going through treatment. She wants upbeat songs and just kick ass music all around. As you can imagine

If you guys can please help I would greatly apprectiate it. 

So far all I have are:

* ""I Will Survive"" by Gloria Gaynor 
* ""Eye of the Tiger"" by Survivor

These are as per her request.
