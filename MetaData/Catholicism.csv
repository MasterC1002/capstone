When I came to this subreddit to post the question

Furthermore

I didn't start out as an atheist.  I was baptized as a Presbyterian.  During my time as a Presbyterian, Christopher Hitchens, and of course, the news in regards to the legal and moral scandals that the Catholic Church has been and is still mired in.  Although I am philosophically inclined to agree with Dawkins and Hitchens rather than not, at least in regards to skepticism toward religion, it would appear that both men, along with other influential atheists

What I have come to learn from this subreddit, like-minded or not, a mob is still a mob and mobs are almost always an ugly lot.

I think the reason why people join like-minded mobs, and I could be wrong, rightly or wrongly, people fall into a victimhood mentality - the thought that we are surrounded by enemies and that we feel the need to lash out lest we are forced out of existence.  As an individual, I doubt that my experiences here will bring about a tectonic shift in the way theists and atheists discuss with one another, much less dispel people's sense of victimhood.  However, it has reminded me of the importance of civility and the need to understand rather than hate.  Perhaps this modest start is as good as any.

I understand we all have different opinions and beliefs. Not everyone on this subreddit is Catholic and not every Catholic here agrees on the same interpretation of the Catechism--heck, without downvoting anyone with a dissenting opinion, without name-calling, and without resorting to hurtful tactics.

I rarely post here anymore. However, and told me that my beliefs were far worse than the sin of supporting gay rights.

Needless to say, I sat on the bedroom floor, gun in my hand, ready to end it all. I wrote a letter to my husband, but I never delivered it because as I wept, I looked up at that cross above my bed and realized that there was hope, even if it was just the smallest bit.

So I went and got help. Even though I still struggle with my faith, and reminded me that there are good people out there. After that message, simply entitled ""Your Catholicism"", I can't be a part of this subreddit anymore. Things have gone too far. To attack me for my beliefs is one thing, but to tell me that God has made me barren because of them is an issue of another level.

I'm writing this because I and a few others on /r/Catholicism have been guilty of it

We can't run around /r/Catholicism trying to evangelize

I notice that a lot of times, or they use sarcasm and belittling comments to respond...instead of actually trying to give a well thought out response. Every absurd question isn't an automatic troll...given the state of Religious Ed in the Church and of religious understanding in the USA, yes, people are really *that* confused about religion that sometimes it seems like only a troll would ask such a stupid question. If they obviously start trolling, then hey, feel free to CCC/Bible-bomb them...but do it without name-calling.

I found some evangelization Guidelines from a popular Catholic forum that I think are appropriate for us all to keep in mind when dealing with others:

- Do unto others as you would have them do unto you...*not* do unto others before they do unto you!
- Always be respectful.
- Question others; do not accuse them.
- Do not question someone's sincerity of belief.
- Do not assume you know someone else's mind/motives.
- Don't use derogatory names or insults.
- Don't place labels on people.
- Discuss

Basically, *we* are representing our Church to them. What we say is taken as what the Church says. When we insult users, belittle them, call them names, or are generally rude to them (even if they are this way to us), then to the observer, it is the Church that is being a jerk.

A simple rule to remember: Accept all people as Christ...

&gt; Then the righteous will answer him, or thirsty and gave you something to drink? And when was it that we saw you a stranger and welcomed you, or naked and gave you clothing? And when was it that we saw you sick or in prison and visited you?‚Äù And the king will answer them, ‚ÄúTruly I tell you, just as you did it to one of the least of these who are members of my family, you did it to me.‚Äù 

- Matthew 25:37-40

From the context of that passage we learn about the Corporal Works of Mercy, if you are being rude, arrogant, or mean, then your message is *wrong*.

I dont know if these were before or after me. Regardless to say, if you need proof that theres life in the womb, there it is. I actually remember being inside it.

Well when I was a newborn baby, supposedly the decedant of prophet muhammed. Thing is, we worshiped this man as if he was God. Something didnt seem right to me, the entire thing just felt like a giant scam. On top of that, my parents divorced. I couldnt believe in a God that would let something like that happen.  Around age 9 I quit believing in God and insisted on never going to mosque if I could help it. I still got dragged along every so often, but I sure didnt like it. 

My atheist life was interesting. I was a very angry kid. I got into fights, I didnt know how to be a positive influence on the world around me.

Shortly after I got into drugs and was drinking heavily all the time. I was around 15-16 at the time. I dont really want to dwell too much on this, so I told my parents. I went through rehab treatments, psych wards (I was suicidal), was in lockdown in my own house, was arrested 2 times for trying to run. Id like to tell you ive been sober for 4 years (Im 20 now) but thats simply not true. Im not sure on your guys stance on pot, but I still consider it a drug, and I had some a few months before my baptism. Regardless of that, but I always got back on me feet. I started going to Narcotics anonymous meetings

3 years ago, and the first thing she told me was ""Im going to be baptized into the Roman Catholic Church"". This was HUGE, she was still a practicing Muslim up to this point. I was extremely shocked, but I said ""I dont agree with your choice, but if it will make you happy then go for it, Im not one to stop you."" I attended her baptism at Easter Vigil. I was happy for her, she had gone through a lot of stuff and whatever had happened to her definitely had made her happy. 

Well a year ago at lent, and since she wouldnt leave me alone, I agreed. I walked into the room with him, and I said this.
""I believe there must be some kind of a higher power or 'God' out there, simply said this. "" I believe in God, but I agree with your stance on religion"". Just like that, I was convinced to listen to his 3 day program. I recently asked him why he said that, after all he preaches telling people to go to confession, repent, and be children of God. He still says he has NO idea why he said it, which most people do not believe.

I went to Aneels 3 day program. On all the days, how evil and corrupt the world around us has become. Essentially, everything in my life I had experienced, he was preaching right back to me. I had this supernatural sensation that my destiny was to be sitting in this church listening to this man. He would talk about the way to redemption through Christ and things like that too, but I was not as focused on that. On the third day, he held a giant healing mass. For those of you who have never been to one of these, what essentially happens is you get prayed over by a priest of a lay person in an attempt to bring the holy spirit into you, just getting prayed over. 

I had never heard of the charismatic side of the church, and it scared the heck out of me. Eventually everyone in the church was finished, except of course, for me. I went to go sit down, but my mother insisted on me getting prayed over. I just went to one of the priests, and he hovered his hand over me. I closed my eyes and sat there as he prayed, when I started to feel something push on my forehead. I opened my eyes, and closed my eyes again. The pushing got more forceful

I figured I should stand up, and I could not. I was paralyzed totally, so in my mind I began to freak right out. And then I heard a voice tell me ""Shaf, be calm"" (Shaf is what everyone calls me, my full name is shafraz). Naturally, I freak out even more, Im hearing voices! Again, be calm"". So I calm down and I say in my mind ""Ok
The voice then said ""Shaf, will change the world"". My body unfroze and my eyes snapped open. I Got up to see my mother bawling her eyes out behind me, and I sat down. 

I struggled for an extremely long time with that experience, about me telling you how I kicked all my addictions. I quit binge drinking, I quit smoking, all effortlessly through the power of the Holy Spirit.  I would normally tell you I would be getting baptized the coming Easter, but my baptism has already happened, so all of you who are reading this are the first people who will get to hear the (extremely awesome) experience I had at my baptism.

By this point I had already received many many gifts of the spirit, Wisdom and Knowledge. I had dreams and visions, and lots and lots of ""Supernatural"" events. God continuously brought people into my life who already assumed I was a priest just when they saw me. I even had a Jesuit priest come up to me and ask what order I belonged to! I understand God wanted me to become a part of this vocation, but I also knew I was ALWAYS given a choice. I didnt know if I could do it, I had problems, and sometimes still do, with my sexual desires. I wanted to have kids someday. I know the option of a Deacon was there, that decision was made shortly after my baptism

The day of my baptism, and agreed to be baptized. Im going to write this EXACTLY how I had experienced it. Keep in mind, I did not think I would actually FEEL anything, I believed the whole thing was merely symbolic.

""Shafraz I baptize you in the name of the Fath-"" I got dunked. I opened my eyes, and I came back up. ""And in the name of the-"" Dunked, before I could even breathe. This time, it seemed like all of time had slowed down. I could feel something leaving my body, as if something was being sucked through every pore and opening in my body, including my eyes. Like a vacuum was trying to suck out my soul. ""And in the name of the Holy Spir-"" Dunked again. What happened at this point may never be able to be explained properly. I could write an entire series of books on what I had felt, and still would not be able to accurately describe what happened to me that night. It was as if my entire being was sucked away and left inside the water. I felt empty, but in a good sense, but I still had the empty feeling

My confirmation ceremony was nothing too crazy, but if you ever read his life, its almost an exact mimic of mine. We were both credited as great speaker, had mothers that continuously prayed for us, worshiped false gods, were both party animals, had experiences with the Holy Sprit, a bishop to be exact!

My first Holy Communion was definitely  a tremendous experience. I did truly believe Jesus was present, and as my turn came, I hears a voice so powerful that it made my body shake. It said ""Kneel before your God"". I immediately dropped to my knees and received it  on my tongue. My body began to shake violently. I could feel this warming sensation spreading throughout my body, but I could NOT stop shaking. Then the blood was passed, and I took a sip. When it touched my tongue, it was like I was struck by lightning, the shaking was even more excessive. I could not stop vibrating for almost an hour afterwards. But most of all

From that day

I want to thank you guys for reading this. This story is in no way to say ""Im so much more spiritual than you are"", but I leave it in Gods hands and have complete trust in him.

Please feel free to ask me anything

God bless
-Shaf

(Im gonna see if I can post pictures of my baptism on here

I have no idea how to give you guys an actual picture

2. Reddit overstates its own significance. After stepping away, but also to the world at large. For some reason everything on reddit seemed like a big deal before.

3. Being ""a redditor"" is a rather meaningless form of identity.

4. Reddit is a fantastic tool for communication with young people beyond your own social sphere. I place a greater value than before on the gift it is to have all of you only a few keystrokes away.

5. Christians have little need to feel offended because offense diminishes with perspective. I often found myself offended as a Catholic, etc while browsing reddit in the past, but the depth of the offense came from an overblown idea of the significance of a reddit comment, or 100 upvotes, or 3 downvotes. 

6. Wasting time on reddit (beyond using it as a tool) seems like an innocent vice, to a deeper vision of life, or even some extra sleep you probably need.

7. ""Do not conform any longer to the pattern of reddit

Secular views include women leading Churches? How is that at all secular? What? Religion has nothing to say on any of those views

One thing I've noticed is that, who want to throw out any belief that they don't like or that doesn't fit with their view of how the world should be apart from their religious views (i.e., their worldview shapes their religious views, and not vice versa), and the conservative fundamentalists, who take extreme positions, and often take the Bible too literally. Catholicism, takes the moderate course. It avoids the errors of relativism without sinking into fundamentalism. It teaches faith and reason together. It opposes sin without attacking those under its power. It's truly a wonderful thing that we don't often take time to think about that Catholicism is, and not get too entangled in contemporary squabbles.

Furthermore, and in terms of the limitations we place on ourselves. We don't simply give in to our desires, but rather place emphasis on control. We strive to do what we are called to do, and to believe what we should believe, regardless of the discomfort it may cause.

These reasons, and isn't something that can be shaped to our will, and furthermore, it avoids the two major errors that have divided Christianity today.

3. **Solid Homilies - Orthodox, one of the [6 Priests](http://www.cantius.org/go/about_us/category/parish_staff/) who serve the Parish. 

4.  **Wide options in Mass form** - You like Latin?  You like Tridentine?  You like Novus Ordo in English?  We've got you covered.  Cantius offers a [wide variety of worship options](http://www.cantius.org/go/liturgy_devotions/category/liturgical_devotional_schedule/). *see below

5. **Reverence** - The Parish itself is home to a religious order, serious, uplifting.  Check out these [pictures of Palm Sunday 2011](http://cantius.org/uploads/photos/2011-palm-sunday/) to get an idea what a mass looks like at Cantius.

6.  **The Music** Oh the glorious music.  Music is a [HUGE part](http://www.cantius.org/go/music/) of this parish's identity.  Every Sunday at every mass heavenly sounds fill the air.  At any one mass as many as two, being saved from a Methodist Church, and [will be installed this summer.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=W5wpnvpVJ8A)  Many consider this organ to be the best sounding pipe organ in Chicago.

1. No accusations. Everyone here is a Catholic making a serious attempt to understand and live out Church teaching. Let us give each other the benefit of the doubt. For now

2. Be thoughtful. Say a prayer before you submit a comment and consider whether your words will bring clarity and focus to the discussion

Some points that I think are very worth discussing are

1. Why does the Church teach that sacramental marriage is between one man and one woman?

2. What is the distinction between sacramental marriage and civil marriage?

3. What is the relationship between sacramental marriage and civil marriage?

4. What role does civil marriage play in secular society?

6. How do we decide as Catholic citizens where to draw the line between legislating morality

This decree covers many areas of social communication even before those means existed.  I think that Catholic Redditors might be surprised that there are little challenges to each of us to stand up for truth and be witnesses to the Gospel in this important decree.  

We often place clergy and religious as the foremost evangelizers but the laity has an extraordinarily important role.  Many priests and sisters know nothing about Reddit and are probably not inclined to learn about Rage Comics
The decree reminds the users of social media to ‚Äú‚Ä¶strive

It seems that the Second Vatican Council anticipated the various forms of social communication even though there was no internet and in many places less than 3 television channels.  We should take care to read what the Second Vatican Council says about social communication to help us be better evangelizers in the world.

tl;dr - read this thing [Decree on the Media of Social Communication]( http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19631204_inter-mirifica_en.html) (It's longer than this post)

At this point I am prayerfully considering the possibility God may be calling myself and my friend to the Catholic church and I was wondering as far as Mass goes. 

Can I just show up? 
Is there anything specific I should know before attending?

Here it is: Do you taste blood and flesh or do you taste wine and bread while believing that it is the blood and flesh of Jesus?

I was raised in a ""non-denominational"" Protestant family. My parents were not very religious

I took the message to heart. I went on retreats and cared about it in a very sincere way. I remember the feeling of ""spiritual joy"" I had during worship and when I was 13 years old I prayed for Jesus to enter my heart.

However nobody seemed to take it as seriously as me. Friends

A few years later while I tried reading the Bible. I enjoyed Genesis well enough

First I disqualified the Bible. Then I disqualified the churches I went to

But eventually I realized I had no basis for this. I decided I had been duped. God wasn't real

Thus I became an atheist and took on a cynical and jaded worldview. Perhaps if God wasn't real, maybe trying to evade death through religion was merely comforting fantasy; so I began to embrace the thought of my own death as though it were a welcoming end to a difficult and pointless life.

However

It was when I reached the apex of my sins, and when I started indulging in truly heinous sexual desires, that I felt separated from the rest of humanity. I could only see myself as either above everyone else, or below everyone else. It seemed like an endless cycle between those two perspectives.

I studied all manner of atheistic philosophy, only to watch it roll down again just before the peak, forever. We were supposed to imagine that he was happy.

I found this rather unsatisfactory; it seemed like another form of self-delusion

I studied more: Kierkegaard

There is a large cathedral nearby which was calling out to me, so I figured it would be a good place to start. I became interested in Catholic perspectives of things like Luther, and thoroughly impressed by the level of theology and history I found in the Church. It seemed much more intellectual and philosophical than the Christianity I had grown up with. I liked that it kept integrity all the way back to the time of St. Peter instead of disowning over a millennium of tradition.

When I first went to Mass

I came to love the ritualistic elements and the more I studied the more I was convinced this was the church for me. I thought that regular Mass attendance

So far it has had a big effect on me. Catholic views have affected all of my political opinions. I came to see the desperately poor around me not as the scum of humanity

Telling my friends and family was difficult. It was embarrassing. Some were disappointed but others were happy and supportive. Ultimately though I was surprised by the level of acceptance

I cannot be sure what the future holds, and take First Communion. I have butterflies in my stomach, but I think I can relax myself when the time comes. Last night I was in a sort of agony as I thought about the life and mentality I was leaving behind by taking this step. There were a lot of evil pleasures I can no longer enjoy fully. From now on I will not be able to sin without confessing it. This fills me with a conflicting sense of both hope and dread. But mostly hope.",,False,self,t5_2qi4f,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1bbvoz/i_will_be_baptized_tonight/
1363607420.0,1aipnl,St. Malachi was right after - why Francis is Petrus Romanus,Speculum,71,23,19,"So you were expecting Peter II....(Peter the Roman at the end of whose reign Rome will be destroyed)? I know some people are confused now wondering how the prophecy of Malachi applies to Pope Francis I. Well

1) Card. Bergoglio took the name of Francis after Francis of Assisi. Now Francis of Assisi's real baptismal name was Giovanni or John. Now, whence by taking the name Francis references John and clearly indicates Peter.

2) Card Bergoglio clearly is ""the Roman"". He might come from Buenos Aires but his ancestors are from Piemont. The capital of Piemont is Torino. Now with the high speed train Frecciarossa it takes 4:10 h from Torino to Roma. This is 250 minutes. If you add the number of white and yellow (papal colors) umbrellas present yesterday at St. Peters

3) Rome will be destroyed. This is even easier to see. Following the example of Pope Francis, an estimate 150.000 pedestrians will die tragically resulting in chaos, contempt and uprisings: the ruin of Rome. The ""dreadful judge"" could refer to Berlusconi, but that is not quite clear yet.

QED. You see it all makes perfect sense 
So be careful and watch out...and don't text while walking through the streets of Rome over the next few days!

2.  In St. Peter's Basilica, and I was wondering if there is a story behind this particular grave being different?  I could tell it was a very special place for the Catholic visitors, we saw many people were praying in the seats set up in front.

3.  At one church we saw some little booths with Priests sitting inside, but it wasn't private, the people were not sitting in the booth, it looked like a window you might buy tickets or food from is the best way I can describe it.  What are these for?

4.  Lastly, wash their hands in what I assume is holy water, and head right into the church, clearly well familiar with ""what to do"".  Is there a standard ""to do list"" for a Catholic visitor to a church?

I don't really know any of you

Please bear with me as I type my thoughts at 3 a.m. English is my third language. So hopefully I can stay on topic and explain myself well.   
I was born in Iraq
All my friends (except a couple) were muslims. I grew up during Iraq's poorest years due to the many sanction by the U.S. Which basically meant the government can only import essential food. So for e.g. because my family was well-off (thanks to my grandfather r.i.p) we could afford to get bananas on christmas/holidays
tbc in a few minutes...

http://imgur.com/mnfbaqz I'm realizing how hard it is to type this from my fraternity house...

I guess I was trying to say is that I had the best childhood. the best. 
When middle school came along I had a few incidents where kids from school would say things and ask why aren't you converting to Islam?  some would say you christians worship the idols in your churches etc. I remember my middle school teacher (she taught Islam, It wasn't all that bad, I have great memories with friends who treated me like a brother.  
Looking back, I never felt at home. I felt like a foreigner in my own land. Other than that I LOVED being apart of a small community. The Church in Iraq is usually more involved in people's lives than here in the U.S. In Iraq when you hear the word catholic, it's usually associated with help/love/work/feeding ANYONE who needed help. I remember I used to see old muslim women with burkas coming in and praying passionately (to whoever they were praying to). Just to be clear the moral of the story is church was a place for anyone to come and talk to God. I guess a sociologist would call it a case of ""model minority.""
....

I'm gonna fast forward  to college
 So now I'm in the U.S. (http://i.imgur.com/jTE4KEG.jpg) in college. I'm in a fratertnity I lived in the fraternity house and had many friends and a great social life. I was doing everything any college kid wants. But to be honest, but I've ignored it for years. But now I couldn't ignore it anymore. I started looking at all religions. At this time, I've started to drift away from catholicism. My teacher in HS talked about how evil the catholic church was. By now I have been influeced by the news, the internet, schools, college have changed what I thought of when I heard the word Catholic. Now when I hear the word catholic three things come to mind 1. Pedophilia 2. abortion 3. homophobia. Yep... the word sure did change since I left Iraq. Time has taken it's toll, now I've become embarassed to be catholic, so it was facebook official). From there I started leaning toward agnosticism, very spiritual and easy to talk to. I swear you could sit there for hours and just listen to this man talk. He had a wife and a son

Why am I told this all the time? How am I somehow less of a woman because I believe that conception means life and that no one has the right to take a life from another? Shouldn't we celebrate the fact that as a woman I have the freedom to express myself without fear of serious

Let me start off by saying that I hate--no, that death is somehow superior to life, and no one is arguing that women shouldn't have a voice or choices. So why do we use those terms?

I believe in freedom, having this opinion gives people the impression that I am ""anti-woman""; for some reason, it has become a social norm for people to say that I am less than woman because I don't think abortion is right. Somehow, me being against ending a pregnancy is the same thing as restricting a woman's freedom to do with her body as she chooses. The same people that accuse me of attempting to suppress women are doing just that when they try to silence my opinion and threaten my femininity for disagreeing with them.

I am not less of a woman because I am anti-abortion. I am not ""anti-choice"" because I feel it is immoral to end a pregnancy. I am not against women because I think adoption is the better option. The people that say they are standing up for women's rights so that we cannot define what a woman is or what she decides to do with her body are hypocritically attacking my womanness because I don't agree with them. They aren't trying to stop the world from defining and controlling women; they're trying to force their own definition of womanness on the rest of us.

So go ahead and threaten my femininity. Try to change my beliefs with bully tactics and threats that my opinions will somehow make me unwoman. The fact of the matter is that I am exercising what all feminists claim to fight for--the right to have a voice,,False,self,t5_2qi4f,False,,True

No doubt, let's say it was my parents, and my dad was waiting for my mom, only to find out 30 minutes later that her leg was blown off, or worse that she had died.  I can only conclude that God was looking over us also.

I know this gets to the point of being thankful to God for all things.  And that the injuries sustained are the result of people's free will and sin

I wanted to make a post introducing myself.  I recently posted a thread here under a throwaway account (cactusbush) about feeling the sudden urge to return to the Church after a long period away.  During my time away, anti-theistic practice slowed down as the years went, my beliefs were always strong and steadfast that I was correct that I had truly found truth in science and what I scientifically knew to be true.

During this period, and not filling his head with religion.  Then my mindset changed.  It was sudden and scared the hell out me (no pun intended).  It took a while for me to figure out where my change came from.  Initially, regaining a desire for the Church was harder than leaving, because I thought, ""I've already been through the questioning phase; I've had my religious journey and come out the other end!""  I could not under stand why, seemingly out of nowhere, I felt called to return to Mass and the Eucharist.  

A few months prior to this, and the first one I'd been to in almost 6 or 7 years.   It was held in our dioceses Basilica, which obviously comes with the all beauty and gothic like structure that the Church is known for.  I think this is what set me on my road back to the Church.  

The more I reflected, I knew I had a great option at my disposal.  I'd already been lurking here, so I made an anonymous throwaway account and asked for advice.  

The response to that was almost overwhelming.  It took a few weeks (longer than what I said in that thread) but I went to confession a last week

My wife, she has agreed to come with us also.  I wont be pressuring her, and with her protestant background, she doesn't understand the beauty of the sacraments that Catholics, and even a lot of ex Catholics, do.  I'm just happy she's coming.

I'll be honest that the beauty of the Church, my priest said the struggles are what make faith what it is, and working through that is our cross.  I hope as time comes on, I begin to feel the holy spirit in the way I once did.  Struggles in theology aside, I feel like I am at home again, and I believe things will fall into place as time goes on.

Thank you again to the people that replied to my original post.  I will try to be more active on this subreddit.

Fast forward to eighth grade

From about the age of thirteen or so I'd started to have doubts about the existence of God. I started to see believing in God as feeble-minded 

Up until yesterday, and I puzzled over it on the ride home, of course telling myself that the feelings I were having had nothing to do with me feeling God, or wanting to believe in God. However, yesterday out of the blue I was struck by the urge to attend mass. Lucky for me there was a mid-day service, I went, and it was like coming home. I broke down crying afterward

I think that a big part of it for me is that for the last eight years I've associated God and Jesus with the evangelicals I seem to come across so often, and seem to view questioning one's faith as the biggest insult to God there is. However, I know there must be another side to it. My problem now is that my brain still wants to shoot down all notions I might have of believing in God with logic. I really don't know how to proceed, I would really like to feel the presence of God again, if I can believe there is a presence to be felt.  Any help you can give me would be welcome.

I was accepted into the seminary and began studying to be a priest.  I began to think that I might not have a priestly vocation and with the help of my superior discerned that I did not.  I was frustrated with the time I had spent working towards a goal that was no longer in sight.  I was embarrassed to be returning home and see all the people I had said goodbye to forever.  I had given away most of what I owned and was in need of an income.

If I was not in such need, I felt like I was stuck.  I applied for various other positions but didn‚Äôt get them.  Each time I was more and more disappointed.  If I had got any of those positions  I would not have met John.

I know our church is against divorce, I have yet to find a group that exists that is fighting to make divorce illegal. I have seen countless Catholic seminars in my area advertising discussions on the Church and gay marriage, but not once have I seen a divorce discussion. Not even support groups for families victimized by divorce (I'm hoping those exist, but they don't seem as common as they should be). It just doesn't seem like the Church is fighting hard to make divorce illegal, but for the topic of gay marriage we are ceaselessly up in arms. 

I think I can form a more consistent view on the sanctity of marriage once I have some closure on marriage issues outside of homosexuality. Could you guys offer me some insights?

Like most young men I have known, mostly finding its way to the surface in the forms of pornography and masturbation.


Yesterday I went to one of the ‚Äúworst‚Äù confessions in my life; I just moved, sighed, and even one time (when I rambled a bit) he asked me bluntly ‚ÄúSo what exactly are you trying to confess here?‚Äù in an impatient tone. I was pretty surprised and kind of uncomfortable. He took this blunt tone further- when it came to confessing my sins of impurity, this is how our conversation went:


    ‚ÄúYou know that this is a serious sin

    ‚ÄúYes

    ‚ÄúAnd I am sure that this is not the first time you have confessed it.‚Äù

    ‚ÄúNo

    ‚ÄúAnd I am sure that other priests have given you advice on how to fight this sin

    ‚ÄúYes

    ‚ÄúAnd have you been following that advice to your best ability?‚Äù


Here I was stuck, that I did all that I could do, but honestly, I knew deep down that that wasn‚Äôt really true. I‚Äôm a pretty lazy guy and it is one of those kind of things that ‚Äújust happens‚Äù, isn‚Äôt it? But he didn‚Äôt even give me the chance to answer because after a quarter-second of silence he added:


    ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right

    ‚Äú‚Ä¶.(pretty harsh

    ‚ÄúSo what exactly are you doing here? Look, but you need to understand that when you sit right there and confess, you are promising that you will do everything you can do to not sin again. You need to consider whether you take that promise seriously.‚Äù

    ‚ÄúYes


Honestly, especially habitual sin, maybe that is what I needed.


Just felt a desire to share this experience, and made me pissed off, first at the priest but then more reasonably at myself for my sins (and isn‚Äôt that what confession is supposed to do?).


So I am asking for your help, but also in a more tangible way, a commitment‚Äî I‚Äôm looking for accountability partners, and if you are in a similar boat as me, maybe you could use one too. We are all busy people for sure, but checking in once a week would be awesome, and a cool way I think for us to help one another out.


My cat‚Äôs out of the bag. I think that has always been the hardest thing to do, or maybe you are suffering from the fact (as I have also experienced) that Catholic peers just don‚Äôt really like to talk about this kind of thing. Well, I‚Äôm not hiding anymore, and it feels better than I thought it would. Maybe I can help you get yourself out of that hole as well. Send me a quick PM with your email. Do it now, before you change your mind. No explanation necessary, just say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in.‚Äù Let‚Äôs help each other out.

* The Holiness of Mary and ""co-redemptrix"": how and why is this justified? Why do so many of the declared infallible dogmas have to do with Mary?

* Do any of you feel some Church teaching is less strictly biblical and more strictly Aristotelian (i.e. transubstantiation)?

This week, and I have a friend who just announced she is pregnant with her first child, though the father has decided to not be in the picture. The icing on this cake was a post on /r/Christianity about a young woman who had an abortion when she was a teenager. One comment in particular set me over the edge this morning:

&gt; Adoption was never an option for me. There was no way that I could carry my child to term

My husband and I are currently waiting to be matched with a child under the age of 18 months. This sentiment cut me deep. So, is what has helped to make our estimated wait time for a baby to be 5-7 years. I'm finding it harder and harder to sympathize with people who have abortions and I really can't take it much longer.

It's been a tough week for me. I haven't been to church in weeks because it's just so damn difficult for me to sit in those pews and see people holding their children or having parishioners smile at me and ask when we will be having one of our own and not feel resentful towards God. I read every day about childless couples in the Bible

I try to handle this as best as I can, so it all came out of pocket), there is nothing left to do. I'm having trouble finding any beauty in my faith. I know (I hope) it's just a passing storm, but God does it hurt. Especially this week, where it feels like God is just laughing at me now.

Edit: The overwhelming support of this community has literally brought me to tears. I have read each and every comment, God and I spoke, and I feel like I'm in a better place today. Many of you are right: I should count the blessings I do have instead of focusing on those I don't. God loves me and wants what is best for me, even if it doesn't feel like it and even if I don't like what that is right now. He's not out to hurt me.

1367744897.0,1dq3rv,"Well, it finally happened.",gravyboatcaptain2,43,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1dq3rv/well_it_finally_happened/, I live here, perhaps teaching at Catholic universities.  So yeah

It was my good friend and roommate, it is just something that I haven't felt the call to do.  I love and admire the priesthood--I even envy seminarians some days, because they will be studying nearly exactly what I will be except in an awesome and holy environment, and with the Church paying the bill.  The thing is that I admire priests the same way I admire National Geographic photographers--I respect so highly what they do, and even sometimes imagine myself in their shoes, but I recognize in myself that I am not *for* a position as a NatGeo photographer.  I see in myself that I wouldn't fit the lifestyle.  And the same with priesthood.  I consider myself open to the possibility, and would take great pride in serving the Church in that way--but I haven't *felt* that.  I would need an extraordinary sign or change to occur in my life to begin to think that is my calling.  As it is, happily two years into the most respectful and loving relationship of my life

The thing is that this roommate of mine pointed to all the things I have been gradually coming into--leaving photojournalism for Religious Studies and philosophy

I think I just needed to put this out there for you all to comment about, but I'd like to hear some kind words.  Honestly I remain pretty darn sure that I am called to serve the Church as laity, and that my relationship is going somewhere for a reason.  I have often prayed that God would help me come into my vocation, and if it was his will to bless my relationship with this young woman--and if not, to help us prepare each other for our true vocations.  I have taken the success of this relationship as a sign that I should, certainly at the present time, continue to devote myself to that.  I have also considered often, and all the success we've enjoyed this far

Well, and even though I remain convinced of my call to laity and perhaps even marriage, I feel like I have a lot to think about in light of that conversation with my roommate.  Make out of it what you will.

Love you all

1365516176.0,1bzmbc,Promotion of Homosexual Marriage Can Constitute the Promotion of Grave Sin,KnightGalahad,83,42,155,"The discussion yesterday regarding Mr. Peters's statement that a Catholic who promotes homosexual marriage should not receive communion was informative and challenging.  However

My understanding of Mr. Peters's conclusion is that it flows from the premise that a Catholic who affirmatively promotes the commission of grave sin is himself in a state of grave sin.  Here is the key part of his analysis:

&gt;Catholics who promote ‚Äúsame-sex marriage‚Äù act contrary to Canon 209 ¬ß 1 and should not approach for holy Communion per Canon 916. Depending on the facts of the case, and/or being sanctioned under Canon 1369 for gravely injuring good morals.

Canon 209  ¬ß 1 states:  ""The Christian faithful

Canon 916 states:  ""A person who is conscious of grave sin is not to celebrate Mass or receive the body of the Lord without previous sacramental confession unless there is a grave reason and there is no opportunity to confess; in this case the person is to remember the obligation to make an act of perfect contrition which includes the resolution of confessing as soon as possible.""

Canon 1339

Canon 1369 states:   ""A person who in a public show or speech, gravely injures good morals, expresses insults, or excites hatred or contempt against religion or the Church is to be punished with a just penalty.""

Peters goes on to give a similar analysis regarding Catholics who promote or assist an actual attempt at a homsexual marriage:

&gt;Catholics who assist others toward attempting a ‚Äúsame-sex marriage‚Äù cooperate in the bad act of those others, according to the canonical principles applying to cooperation in crime per Canon 1329 and/or scandal per Canon 1339 ¬ß 2, etc.  

My understanding of his analysis is that from a Catholic moral standpoint the promotion of homsexual marriage and the active assistance in an attempt of such marriage are equivalent because they result in a break with communion with the Church through the promotion of error and promotion of the immoral acts of others.

I posted this to ensure that TheHolyFerret's thoughtfulness and generousity did not go unthanked or unrecognized as well as to inspire others to commit random acts of kindness everyday and to offer them up to God.  Thank you again kind sir and /r/Catholicism for helping me to come back to this beautiful Catholic faith.

Some background to the question: I realize that Catholics do not worship Mary, when asked, would of course say that Christ is more important, but when observing Catholic practices and iconography I get this feeling in the pit of my stomach like something is 'off'. Like, even though Christ has most of the focus, the ratio of Christ focus to Mary/Saints focus is a little too close to even for my liking.

Ok so after that long-winded paragraph, personally, give to Mary? I affirm her statement in the Magnificat that she is blessed and experienced incredible favor from God in that she was entrusted with carrying and raising the Son of God. On the other hand, I understand that in confession, a priest may ask me to pray to her (say Hail Marys?) as part of penance. This sets off all sorts of alarm bells for me.

 I was never religious at all growing up, you can't explain it. This never sat right with me, I didn't understand how you can believe in something this immense and not be able to explain it to others. But that never mattered much because we were in love and I thought that that would prevail over all. 



So we had been having unprotected sex for a couple years using the pull out method and then of course she got pregnant. We were both very excited at first. But her parents seemed pretty disappointed with her and I think that along with being visibly pregnant walking around college campus at 20 made her feel ashamed. After she had the baby I could tell she was slowly pulling away from me. We had long since stopped having sex but she would no longer kiss me goodbye or tell me that she loved me anymore.
 


Finally she talked to me about everything and said that she was just being a Cafeteria Catholic and how everything we did was wrong and that she didn't want to be with me because she could no longer see us getting married because I didn't believe in God.



This really hurt me because I never wanted her to feel hurt or let down. And I was always planning on marrying her one day. And I guess that's what has brought me here. I know that the only way we could ever be together is if I convert. And I feel like I do belong with her because I still love her very much and want to be with her for the rest of my life. Ya know? I feel like there's gotta be something more and that this must have some meaning or I wouldn't still be feeling the way I feel about her.



I feel so lost. I can't understand why this would happen to me.. She has given me a couple books which I have read (one was about a surfing priest and the other was a gynecologist explaining Catholic marriage)



I want to know how Catholicism makes sense to you and why you have faith in it. If you just want to tell me your story, but why the Catholic version is correct would be appreciated.

tl;dr: try to explain to me why Catholicism is the truth

Then one Holy Week a few years ago, I was absolutely struck by how much of myself I saw in Pilate.  *Pilate!*  I felt embarrassed and ashamed that of all the wonderful people in the bible, *Pilate* was the one I identified with.  Like him, I felt as if I was questioning an innocent man when I was questioning my faith. I did not want to condemn him, I did not *want* to leave my faith, but so many people were around me pushing me to do so (""Crucify him! Crucify him!"") I was just so utterly *lost* in my search for Truth.  

Then there comes a point where Jesus says ""For this I was born, my faith, who many held to be a king among kings, a truly holy man; some even called him the Messiah and the Son of God (in the case of the Church, the Rock of Peter and the Bride of Christ.)  I even *liked* him, and saw no blame in him.  But all around me there was an angry crowd telling me how terrible he was, and how he deserved to die.  

Pilate makes his choice, my faith, and let the crowds do what they want to him, or investigate further his claim that he came to ""testify to the Truth.""   I chose the latter.  I chose to ask questions, to immerse myself in the faith and learn of its history.  I no longer sought Truth in some vague sense, I sought Truth in Christ--*and I found it!!*

A young devout Catholic sister, Mexico is in dire need of our support and help.

**Story**

She is a leader in a Christian university work in Veracruz. She is highly respected by many of her friends and known to be a faithful sister. She was traveling to see Pope Francis in Brazil with other sisters. She had to fly through Peru. In Peru she noticed that her passport was stolen

Her father picked her up. Then the airlines brought them in, and put her in an enclosed room. They presented her with the same luggage. She again DENIED for a second time the ownership of the luggage, and asked for her real one. The police proceeded to open the luggage and they found 10 kilos of drugs.

Her father was also intercepted by police and asked the same questions.  The sister is currently going to a high security penitentiary facility in Mexico accused of Narcotics trafficking.

**Help and Support** 

The attempt is to reach national TV media in Mexico. Thousands of people are coming to her aid and support but the problem has not reached the proper attention needed. Please:

1. Prayer for our sister in Christ Angel de Maria. 
2. There is work for open letters to the public opinion and the government to ask for the release and for justice for Angel de Maria
3. Please also join the facebook page https://www.facebook.com/liberADMe1. 
4. Spread the message to any forums. All attention will help get her case properly heard.
5. Twitter hash tag: #LiberADMe
6. Try to let the Pope know.
 
 
**Note:** **Please upvote this** as this needs as many eyes as possible. I am not looking for Karma here

**Update 1:** Some **news sources** have started picking up the story. I will add them here as I find them:

* [Poster with her picture](http://imgur.com/632J729)

* The media director of the Archdiocese in Xalapa showing support for the sister and asking the authorities for a proper investigation: http://metropolitanoenlinea.com/?p=231743

**Update 2:**

It turns out that even though she had traveled with only ONE bag

As for more media outlets picking this up:

* The issue was broadcast on both Mexican nation wide TV stations' news shows. 
* CNN editors are investigating the issue and deciding if they are going to broadcast it. Pray so that their decision is enlightened.

**Update 3:**

The Federal Attorney General (I think that's the correct translation) of Mexico just announced that Angel de Maria will be freed in the next hours for obvious reasons and evidence in her favor!!!

Glory be to God!!!

1367354788.0,1dfoqe,Question for r/Catholicism from a Protestant.,SmashleyM,39,8,20,"Let me preface this question by saying that I am not trying to come off as rude

I believe that Jesus' death on the cross was atonement for my sin and now I have been redeemed and I have eternal salvation in Jesus Christ.

Romans 8:1-4
""Therefore, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh to be a sin offering. And so he condemned sin in the flesh, in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit."" (Romans 8:1-4 NIV)

Galatians 2:20-21
""I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, who loved me and gave himself for me. I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing!‚Äù (Galatians 2:20, 21 NIV)

Ephesians 2:4-10
""But because of his great love for us, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions‚Äîit is by grace you have been saved. And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus, in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus. For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith‚Äîand this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God‚Äî not by works, so that no one can boast. For we are God‚Äôs handiwork, which God prepared in advance for us to do."" (Ephesians 2:4-10 NIV)

Do Catholics believe the same? If so

I come from a family of non-believers and I go to a Baptist College. I have never had exposure to Catholicism and I only know some basics. I have had this question for sometime and I figured this was the perfect place to ask! I'm not wanting to argue doctrine or anything

""Yes

Now, I didn't ask. I did think that I was probably being scammed in some way and remained on alert for our walk.

I turned him down and said I had to get home. He grabbed me by the arm very tightly, startling me, looked right at me and said ""Jesus loves you very much!""

I lost religion by about middle school, etc.

I started re-examining my atheism in college, etc.  The more I read of Catholic philosophers, and particularly the those that spoke of the sort of God that Aquinas spoke of, the more sense it all made.  Things like the ""problem of evil"" no longer seemed too daunting when I reasoned through them, whereas previously such questions elicited complaints that I should not ask questions at all.  Moreover, I found in Catholicism something that seemed far too lacking in my Protestant experiences, namely consistency and tradition

Suppose I can reason myself into the proposition that a God exists and is omnipotent, and is justice, truth, and love itself -- and I have seen this position defended quite thoroughly.  But how from there does one move toward the more specific dogmas of the faith, particularly ascetic values and specific rituals?  That is the bit that I have trouble with.

With thanks due for clarifying the current situation
&gt;I agree with pretty much everything people have been posting. Active users in the community should not be discouraged from posting their own blog posts, yet still submit links to their blogs which get put in the spam filter automatically. So, to some degree, this is already happening.

&gt;However, please hit the report button under the submission instead of just downvoting. Otherwise I may miss it.**

Wrapping up the *sensum redditum* on the account in question

* [/u/dlongenecker1](http://www.reddit.com/user/dlongenecker1)'s links do contribute to good
* most oppose the seeming link-and-ditch method (see: [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette))
* someone suggested an AMA here
* someone suggested [/u/dlongenecker1](http://www.reddit.com/user/dlongenecker1) be cut some slack because Fr. Longenecker a member of the clergy
* a few disliked that seemingly every blog post was linked (we are not a dumping ground)
* a few noted feeling conflicted: at what price an active community?
* plenty felt there was nothing wrong

**On a positive note:** While it is still unclear how automated [/u/dlongenecker1](http://www.reddit.com/user/dlongenecker1)'s postings are

She had went out dancing and drinking with her girlfriends and then meet up with a co-worker. She didn't arrive home until nearly seven in the morning. She originally told me she had just stayed out to sober up at work. In hindsight I know this seems obvious that this was risky behavior
her word. I feel like such a fool.

Right now I don't know what to do. Everything feels surreal

It's been about 5 hours now and I can't sleep. I feel like I have the flu now. I think I have a fever but I have the chills, my mouth is dry and I have a terrible headache. 

I am also having terrible thoughts. I can't stop thinking about the actual sex act she did with him. I keep thinking about going and beating the hell out of him. I am also having fleetting thoughts of suicide. 

I don't know what to do. I don't want to post this is the other reddits because I don't want advice from non Christians. I don't want to get divorced but I don't know how to handle this. My wife seems remorseful but the thought keeps going through my head that if I stay

I just don't know what to do

Where can we go for catholic marriage counseling? Has anyone else dealt with this? 

Edit; We are going to morning mass and to talk to the priest afterwards. I hope we can get through this.

2nd edit; 

My wife and I went to morning Mass and meet with the priest afterwards

First

Secondly

As far as the cheating

My wife has self esteem issues. I know this so I make a strong effort to compliment her, attractive person and she tosses me aside for the simplest of pickup lines. It's emasculating. It's humilating. 

I am scared. I am heartbroken beyond anything I have ever felt. I know this sounds awful but when I came home and saw the look on her face

The priest told us that sometimes after cheating a marriage can be better than ever. I'd like to believe that. I WANT to believe that. But I don't believe that. Maybe I'm just too caught up in my emotions but I don't see how this is possible.

We've had marital difficulty before. When we first got together my now wife felt like she had to discuss the #'s of past sexual partners. I had none before her. She gave me the # and details about some of them (one night stand, I was not a Catholic at the time or a practicing Christian, we converted a few years after we were married) but just though ""okay."" The problem was that slowly through our marriage she would mention things that were inconsistent with what she had told me before. Relationships changed, the # got bigger. I could have accepted that as being ashamed and wanting to protect my feelings, because she knew some of those details could be hurtful. But with her friends, she laughed about these stories and told details of her past she had never told me, details that she knew where humiliating. 

When this information came out, that it seems like I was judging her for her past but I wasn't. It wasn't a matter of ""I need to know everything"" it was that I was finding this stuff out in some of the most humiliating ways possible.

During and after this we stopped going to Mass. I was still angry with God. But I slowly started to heal from this rough part in our marriage and felt a draw back to the Mass, for lack of a better word it felt, nice. It felt like home.

I thought we were in the best place possible in our marriage. We have never been able to have children but even that didn't feel lacking. If it happened, so happy, so content. And now this. My life is changed forever in a 6 hour time period. 

I'm not angry with God. At least not now. I can't say that I won't experience that emotion in the future. But as of now

My wife quit her job. She also changed her phone number and cut ties with her friends at work. She said she wants to rebuild trust

The priest said not to make any decisions for 6 months or more. I know this is the right thing to do. My emotions change minute to minute. I can't imagine basing a life altering decision on the way I feel now.

I am not drinking. I want to. I want to really badly. I just want to feel numb. But I don't think I could stop if I started right now. And I know alcohol and depression don't mix very well.

1370431139.0,1fpqpn,"Contraception, NFP, and the Tradition",InTeConfidoIesu,42,101, and think it's important enough

I have been in an endless and acute internal debate about the issue of contraception for months now. Last week, but rather someone sincerely attempting to find the truth.

The problem is that the Church is experiencing some major cognitive dissonance at the moment. This dissonance is perfectly expressed in its promotion of Natural Family Planning (NFP). Basically, and (c) that sexuality is somehow a ""beautiful thing."" Like it or not, this is not in line with the Tradition.

Here is what Augustine had to say:

&gt;It is, which is not sinful: it is another thing for them to desire carnal pleasure in cohabitation, but with the spouse only, which involves venial sin. For although propagation of offspring is not the motive of the intercourse, there is still no attempt to prevent such propagation, either by wrong desire or evil appliance. They who resort to these, although called by the name of spouses, but pretend the honourable designation as a cloak for criminal conduct. (On Marriage &amp; Concupiscence)

This is not an eccentricity on the part of Augustine; some of the Church Fathers were even more radical:

&gt;If a man marries in order to have children

&gt;Do you imagine that we approve of any sexual intercourse except for the procreation of children? He who is too ardent a lover of his own wife is an adulterer. (Jerome)

And of course Paul said ""it is better not to touch a woman

So basically, and a *mortal* sin to avoid procreation by ""wrong desire""‚Äîe.g. NFP. (Augustine actually mentions a primitive form of the rhythm method as an abomination in another writing which I can't find right now.)

By accepting NFP, pleasure-is-fundamentally-good, sex-is-beautiful tradition.

I really have not taken a position here yet, but it all rings false‚Äîin the end, NFP is using a technology to prevent conception while still allowing sexual intercourse. Either the Church has to embrace contraception, or drop NFP. I don't see a way around it.

In the same treatise (On Marriage &amp; Concupiscence), was applicable only in a world before Christ. After Christ, our duty is to deny ourselves and spread the word. Fertility as such is not important in the early Tradition. Paul advises marriage mainly to avoid fornication. How is that incompatible with a contracepted relationship? The main argument against marriage has always been the fact that it turns one's eyes away from God and toward wife and children. Could not a family with a wife and two children be more conducive to focus on God than a family with a wife and ten children, and all the massive worldly worries that brings up today?

It is possible the Church Fathers were simply wrong on this issue. The argument could be made that they‚Äîesp. Augustine‚Äîwere so heavily influenced by Platonic dualism and Stoicism that they separated soul and body too much in their thought. Or they were right

Either sexual pleasure is a good independent of the children it produces, NFP is contraception, and, I would argue, artificial to boot) is not an essential matter.

The stakes here are very high: for those, obedient Catholics, being confronted by this mixed message can lead to all sorts of uncertainty about the Church's teaching authority. It is sort of a ""lynchpin"" issue. Thoughts?

**Bonum:**

- A proper narthex. In too many churches

- Putting the baptismal font front and center when you enter the nave. This is where baptisms should be performed

- A sprinkling of Latin. I'm no SSPX Vatican II denier, the Agnus Dei, etc. in Latin.

- Well-behaved kids dressed up for Church. Shows that the parents are on the ball. Bonus points for little girls wearing the veil.

- Priests who actually talk to you! Open with a joke

**Nefas:**

- Hands down, a Masonic temple), and that little box with crackers in it is an afterthought. I can barely bring myself to attend Mass in churches set up like this.

- Inefficient Communion distribution. I don't particularly like EMHCs (although I am trained as one myself). However, but said parish really ought to use the Communion rail just to keep things moving. While we're on this...

- Ushers dismissing people aisle by aisle to go up for Communion. Exactly what problem do they imagine they're solving here? Would people trample over one another to get in line if left to their own devices?

- Obvious high altar-ectomy. There are some churches where it's painfully obvious that a beautiful high altar was excavated the moment Vatican II was handed down. It's typically seen in large, whitewashed square of wood at the back of the altar.

- Electric votive candles. I realize that God doesn't care if I light a real candle or an electric one

- Bad cantors. I'm sorry

&gt; Almighty God, and Jacob, revealed to us so powerfully in your Son, Jesus Christ, we thank you for showering your blessings upon this our beloved nation.  Bless all here present, and all across this great land, who work hard for the day when a greater portion of your justice, may prevail in these United States.  Help us to see that a society‚Äôs greatness is found above all in the respect it shows for the weakest and neediest among us.

&gt; We beseech you, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

&gt; Thus do we praise you for the gift of life.  Grant us the courage to defend it, that they may be welcomed and protected.  Strengthen our sick and our elders waiting to see your holy face at life‚Äôs end, that they may be accompanied by true compassion and cherished with the dignity due those who are infirm and fragile.

&gt; We praise and thank you for the gift of liberty.  May this land of the free never lack those brave enough to defend our basic freedoms.  Renew in all our people a profound respect for religious liberty:  the first, and love.  Make us ever-grateful for those who, for over two centuries, have given their lives in freedom‚Äôs defense; we commend their noble souls to your eternal care, as even now we beg the protection of your mighty arm upon our men and women in uniform.

&gt; We praise and thank you for granting us the life and the liberty by which we can pursue happiness.  Show us anew that happiness is found only in respecting the laws of nature and of nature‚Äôs God.  Empower us with your grace so that we might resist the temptation to replace the moral law with idols of our own making

&gt; We praise and thank you for the American genius of government of the people, and might, we ask your guidance for those who govern us:  President Barack Obama, Vice President Joseph Biden, Congress, the Supreme Court, and all those, who seek to serve the common good by seeking public office.  Make them all worthy to serve you by serving our country.  Help them remember that the only just government is the government that serves its citizens rather than itself. With your grace

&gt; And finally Lord, in every land, who yearn to conduct their lives in freedom and justice.  We beg you to remember, as we pledge to remember, those who are not free; those who suffer for freedom‚Äôs cause; those who are poor, out of work, needy, or alone; those who are persecuted for their religious convictions

&gt; And most of all

Lately, none of which led to any job prospects--the money we had put aside for a baby we began using to cover living costs. My husband and I began fighting as things got tight around here, and though he is in school, the student loans and his part time job have only given us enough money for basic necessities. He began accusing me of not trying to find work and being lazy.

On top of this, but because of our financial situation, we had to cancel the appointment--even though the program the doctor put us on is actually working and brought my period back after 18 months of not having one.

Fast forward to Monday of last week. I received word from a job I applied for that the position had been filled, and since I was the only one on at 3 am on a Tuesday, she decided to message me. Months of hard work, not eating an ounce of ice cream to help maintain the periods the Metformin had brought back, completely removing all forms of gluten from my diet, and drinking so much water I thought the local kids were going to use me as a swimming pool, my periods stopped AGAIN. And AGAIN

I was so angry at God. Here I was doing everything I could to find a job, and nothing was happening. I cried and cried, wondering why all my hard work wasn't paying off, why everything was constantly falling apart in my life and had been falling apart since I converted to Catholicism. I asked Him what He wanted from me, what I could do to get in His favor again, and what He expected me to do. As with all my prayers for the past few months, I heard and felt nothing: only silence.

I didn't pray on Wednesday last week. I was like the angry child giving their parent the silent treatment because I didn't get my lollipop. I felt like God had abandoned me, and I felt like everyone else mattered more to Him in the world than me. Wednesday was not a good day.

Thursday morning, I received a phone call from a job that I had forgotten I had applied to. They wanted me to come in for an interview on Friday afternoon. I called them back and told them I would be there.

On Friday

The interview went really well, I finally got the job.

I woke up Saturday morning feeling completely rested and refreshed. I don't think I woke up once during the night. And when I went to pee, even if it was a week late.

As if things couldn't get any better, but it will be covered by insurance! Because I'm employed! And the appointment is the day after my birthday! And I'm due to ovulate the day after the appointment! The timing of everything came together too perfectly for this all to be just a coincidence.

I apologize if this really isn't the appropriate place for this and that it was so long. I have no religious friends to share this with, especially if it doesn't fit with what we think is best for us. I know I felt like that just last week--I was so hopeless and angry, and I honestly felt like He had forgotten me. But I know better now.

The past few months have been rough. I won't go into details, I forgot to eat beforehand and wound up getting sick and having to leave before the service even started.

Today, so I just wandered around, lit some candles as an offering and prayed. I saw some free rosaries with cards explaining how, and as I don't remember the mysteries nor all the prayers, I picked one up. Walking back to my dorm, I walked past an Interdenominational Church. I decided to walk in and explore that church as well. While sitting in the pew, I suddenly felt like praying the rosary. I went to pull down the kneeler, I kneeled on the floor and said the rosary. My knees were killing me

By then, there would be lots of people. I still got there early enough that there weren't a lot of people, so someone in charge came and asked me if I would like to present the gifts. I went into a bit of a panic mode and declined. 

Once mass started I realized something. The responses have changed. I kept looking at everyone else, especially since the elderly lady sitting next to me seemed totally fine with the new responses, and it's so hard changing from what you've known for years. Afterwards, she and I talked a little bit. She was so nice, and the congregation seemed rather close to each other. So long story short, I think I'm going to start going to mass again and considering coming back to the Church. ",,self,,

Although my family is catholic, I'm sure they'll come around eventually). So instead of every Sunday, I started going to mass once a week at a church on campus. My campus is quite large, but the attendance is probably between 10-15 people per mass. Between school, work and everything in between, my devotion has been dwindling and I've become lazy... The only consistent thing I do is read a daily devotional ""Jesus Calling"" by Sarah Young every morning, and pray at night.

NFP is something that initially when I hear about it it‚Äôs like ‚Äúsay what?‚Äù just because I was never brought up thinking about it or ever considering it as an option‚Ä¶like, pretty bad but I also believe in supporting my children financially as best as I can, and (let‚Äôs get real) constant pregnancy doesn‚Äôt sound too appealing to me (which I know if done correctly doesn‚Äôt happen).

An important reason, the sacrament of marriage reveals to us God's innermost secret. That God exists as an eternal exchange of love...an eternal relationship of love between Father (Lover), Son (Beloved) and Holy Spirit (Love Shared).  Therefore, marriage is necessary to us for our understanding of God as love...best defined as the exchange between Lover, Beloved, and the Love they share...
 
Okay, and shared Love? What‚Äôs the diff?  The Trinitarian Love of God as Lover, Beloved, and Generative Love is certainly revealed to us as a spiritually mysterious reality.  We use ‚ÄúFather‚Äù to be able to define some of the characteristics of the Trinitarian head because that is how God has been revealed to us, not because we believe he has possesses an old man‚Äôs body.  Certainly, this mysterious spiritual reality is confusing and that‚Äôs why God stamped into our human bodies a way to have a small taste of this exchange.  Thus, we come closest to experiencing this eternal exchange of love ""in the flesh"", but that he reveals just a small taste of His infinity through the bonding power of our biological humanity.  This happens through the God given human ability to participate in the unitive as well as life-giving nature of the intimate exchange of the ""one flesh union""...Sex.  Husband
 
This is often tough to swallow, our culture stripped sex and marriage far apart.  Saying marriage is not necessary for sex and sex is not necessary for marriage.  Resulting in a secularized marital ""union"" that simply means you can get some pictures, cake and government tax cuts.  If that was our definition of marriage, then sure, everybody should get some of that.  But no, the Church rightly states that marriage cannot be understood without sex and sex is not understood separate from marriage.
 
Thus, if it wasn't for that 2,000 year old understanding of marriage (or older since we get this revelation from Genesis), and the fact that this definition of marriage has existed throughout all the major cultures of Western civilization (because most of them were Christian), long, long before our baby government (230+ yrs. old) then heck yeah, SCOTUS,,False,t3_1b80js

1362519145.0,19qcjz,Prayer for Conversion ,mitkw,33,3,30,"I would like to ask for prayer regarding my decision to enter into the Roman Catholic Church. This is something that has become an almost all consuming issue at the forefront of everything that I think about all the time. 

Some background first of all, the most recent of which they helped to start about 8 years ago. 5 years ago I graduated from High School and began going to school about 3 hours away from home.

At school I had a very difficult time in finding a church home. I knew that it was something that was important and that I needed to address. I visited several of the big Baptist churches in town but was met with difficulties of either doctrine (Calvinist background) or getting there (not having a car can be difficult) but I endeavored to attend church because I felt obligated to do so. Because of the difficult I had in attending churches I would bounce back and forth between one of the big Baptist churches in town and one of the big Methodist churches which was right next to campus. Because of my Calvinist background my parents also recommend I look into Presbyterianism, never really feeling at home.

While this was going on there was a leadership crisis at my home church which greatly disturbed me. The pastor had acted out of dishonesty and eventually left. The church was elder-led and my father was an elder. Then for 18 months there was a seemingly half-hearted search for a new pastor as if the elders did not know what to do or how to do it. This frustrated me a lot at what I saw as a deficiency of church government. So I started looking.

I study history, so I started looking into Presbyterianism, Lutheranism, Anglicanism, and slightly at Orthodoxy and Catholicism. The structure appealed to me so I started to look into doctrine.

At this point I really didn't think I would go into Catholicism. If you had told me I was thinking about it I would have laughed! My best friend since high school is Catholic, so why not look into it more? And that's when I started to dive in.

I started reading books, differences with others, and then. I started dating a Catholic girl. She wasn't very knowledgeable, attended Mass irregularly at best, but I wanted to know more! So I Started diving in more. Church was not really important to her, and I was getting tired of searching for a home after several years, so we quit going to church. And then last May, my world came crashing down.

I underwent a mental and spiritual breakdown in May. I was incredibly depressed and despondent. At some points I was close to ending my own life. I thank God for the people that He put in my life to stop me and bring me back to reason. As I was violently shaken that I would think about killing myself, and it changed my life. I was reminded that I was loved by God, that He purchased my life, and I need not fear. I still think that this helped save my life. My girlfriend returned from her Study Abroad after having her own experiences with God and a newfound fervor to return to the Church. Together we dove into this.

For me this consisted of enrolling through RCIA, and really smart people, and grappling with the doctrines and dogmas of the Roman Catholic Church. At this point I believe that I do want to become Catholic.

And here is the problem. I have expressed my desire to my family and they are literally mortified. My parents have both expressed their extreme displeasure with my examination of Catholicism, because he believes he needs to be neutral. I have no desire to dishonor my parents, or cause them stress. I don't want to cause problems for them and their friends or the rest of our extended family. But at the same time I feel that I need to do something.

 Through experiencing the love of the Catholic community. The beauty of the Mass. The spiritual experiences I have had, and re-examining, evaluating, and re-evaluating is really starting to wear me out. And I don't know what to do.

As Easter draws closer and closer

Really I just need prayer. Lots of it. And the courage to act upon whatever God wants me to do. I don't want to please everyone, read some books and listened to talks by men such as Scott Hahn, Peter Kreeft, Taylor Marshall, St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, and others

1361145877.0,18pw6a,Introducing Catholic Forum - an informal discussion of each week's liturgy.,Sporknight,30,1,3,"The 1st Sunday of Lent
Hello reddit!  My Lenten resolution this year is, I've decided to start a weekly discussion of each Mass‚Äôs readings, including their historical and liturgical background.  I‚Äôll also go into their personal significance to me, and I‚Äôd love it if each of you brought your own wisdom and perspective as well!  
This idea is thanks to an adult faith formation group at my old church that would meet after each Mass to discuss the readings over coffee and pastries.  I found it helped me develop a lot as a Catholic

This week's readings can be found here:
http://usccb.org/bible/readings/021713.cfm

A disclaimer: I in no way claim to be any kind of authority on what these readings are really trying to get across.  I‚Äôm just trying to get a discussion going.

**1st Reading**:
DT 26:4-10
Deuteronomy, to guide them through difficult times (the Babylonian Exile, specifically) to be closer to God.  Whenever they celebrate the Lord by sacrificing the fruits of the land (that He led them to!), they are to recall the difficult path they took to get there, and how the Lord was always there to guide them in their time of need.

As a lector, and what we can learn from those lessons.  Whenever we find ourselves oppressed and downtrodden, we should remember that the Lord is with us.  

I always like to find the connections between the first (usually Old Testament) reading, and was also subjected to challenges and temptations.  He remained steadfast, however, and made it through these challenges unharmed.  What kind of parallels can you draw between this reading and the Gospel?

**2nd Reading**:
ROM 10:8-13
The second reading is almost always an epistle, Paul writes:
""For Christ is the end of the law for the justification of everyone who has faith. Moses writes about the righteousness that comes from (the) law, ""Who will go up into heaven?"" (that is, to bring Christ down) or ""Who will go down into the abyss?"" (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).'""  

The coming of Jesus represents an evolution of God‚Äôs covenant with the people.  In Moses‚Äôs time, righteousness has to come from faith, too.  A faith that we must believe in our hearts, and confess with our mouths.  And it is this faith that unites us together under God.

I also like how this preceding passage calls us to not pass judgement on those around us by wondering who will go into heaven or hell.  Our priority should be in our belief in Christ.  

**Gospel**:
LK 4:1-13
This should be a familiar reading to most of us.  The desert stretching before us draws a parallel to the long 40 days of Lent

‚ÄúOne does not live on bread alone‚Äù.  Is He talking about the Manna in the desert that fed the wandering Jews?  Or perhaps he‚Äôs drawing an early connection to the Eucharist?  The bread is one thing, instead of forgetting about it by the time we get to the church parking lot.  Also, this is sound advice when you‚Äôre fasting!

‚ÄúYou shall worship the Lord your God, petty rage or envy.  These, through sin, only serve to distance us from God however.  In this day and age, I don‚Äôt think the concern would be us worshiping some other deity directly, but rather that we would be absorbed in material matters.  We should discern the difference between immediate pleasures, and true happiness.

‚ÄúYou shall not put the Lord, that even He could not eat it?‚Äù!  But seriously, this passage also emphasizes that we shouldn't go out of our way to put ourselves into ridiculously dangerous situations, and expect God to bail us out.

A final note that struck me at Mass this evening...The last few words of this reading: ‚ÄúHe departed from him *for a time*.‚Äù  The Devil was done with his temptations for that particular moment, even for Jesus.  We would do well to remain vigilant, and take each temptation as an opportunity to strengthen our relationship with God.

My wife and I were having a discussion about this that got a little heated last week. I'm in favor of such a world. She is not.

I noted that the English and Welsh bishops brought this back for their flocks last year. I noted that people (including me) don't take seriously the Friday penance. I said people would do one of the following: continue to disregard the rule (like they may do requirements about going to mass and any other law of the Church)

She noted that if something like this came about while she was struggling with the faith, especially in today's world. She said there are more important things to worry about, particularly the notion of sin. She'd rather have, I think, a prescribed set of sermons/homilies over the course of a few years to reinvigorate the faithful. Overall though, she would prefer it always to remain an option, not a requirement.

This was a 30-minute-long discussion and I'm not giving either side its full due.

The saints should not just be admired or prayed to, the greatest failure by the world's standards. Jesus Christ is not a super-star, but the poor one of God. The Church holds up the saints for our consideration to show us that perfection is accessible to everyone, and that sanctity does not require a nice voice, a remarkable intelligence, beauty, physical strength or fortune. No qualifications or recommendations are needed to become a saint. It is enough to have a heart and a  bit of good will. The grace of God and His mercy will do the rest. The saints may convince you that you too can stop leading a dull and useless life which you consider a failure and instead begin your adventure in search of holiness.""

Thank God for this Reddit. I am a Catholic through and through, I act otherwise. I don't want to be lukewarm anymore. I don't want to fall into the same sins, like watching pornography and committing masturbation, and neglecting prayer life. I have a baby coming in a few months, and I need to be ready as I can be. I want to live a convicted life... To be who God planned for me to be.
