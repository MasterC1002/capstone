After the chicken is cooked, you can remove desired portions as needed. 

Now the fun stuff. There's endless options for readily available shredded chicken. Here's some of my favorites (and the most budget-friendly):

------------------------
1c chicken **3.25**
   
1 can black beans **.75**

1 can of corn (or cup frozen) **.50**

2Tbps siracha or hot sauce. 

*mix and heat in microwave or stovetop. Eat with spoon

--------------------------

1c chicken **3.25**

6 celery ribs **1.00**

3Tbls buffalo sauce **.50**

1/4c blue cheese crumbles or blue cheese dressing **.50**

*Mix and heat chicken and buffalo sauce, easy, and satisfying.* **($.87/rib)**

-----------------------------------

1/2 cup chicken **1.62**

1/2 keilbasa rope

5 potatoes

1 bell pepper

I pkt of onion soup mix **1.00**

1/4 olive oil **.50**

*mix all ingredients, $1.71/per serving)**

--------------------------------

1c chicken

1 box of bowtie pasta

1 9oz bag of baby spinach **2.00**

2c creamy ceaser dressing **2.00**

1/2c fresh grated Parmesan **1.00**

*Toss everything together. Serve warm or chill and serve later. Serves 8 as a side

--------------------------------

The frozen chicken thaws easily for anything you'd usually use chicken for: nachos, soup, wraps, sammies, etc. The frozen shredded chicken is a HUGE time saver for me. My last post here did pretty well, so I thought you'd like more of my ideas. ",,self,,

1366083477.0,1cftrp,"Homemade tortilla chips, anyone? Super easy, super cheap, and tastes WAY better than Tostitos.",brat1979,49, I've always made them at home. This method is way cheaper

So here goes! You will need:

* 5 whole tortillas (5 makes enough for 2 people to lightly snack on

* 2-tbs of olive oil (canola and vegetable are fine too

* Whatever spices you want. Despite not having testicles, Tony Chacheros, garlic powder, cumin, and S &amp; P of course. 

* cooking spray (optional)

* aluminum foil (optional)

* ziploc zipper baggie

Okay! So you got everything you need.

0) Before starting

1) Cut your stack of tortillas into triangles, amount of guacamole? Or you like smaller little triangles that you can lightly coat with delicious salsa one after another, in rapid succession because you haven't gotten laid in a while and *oh god* those chips are so good? I'm not here to fuckin judge, cut 'em how you want 'em.

2) Toss your triangles into your ziploc baggie. Obviously the more chips you're making, excuse *me* your majesty), it's cool, just toss your triangles on your cookie sheet.

3) Ziploc method: pour about 2 tbs of olive oil into the baggie along with your chips. If you didn't get ziplocs because you're not 8 years old anymore and don't take a PB &amp; J with you to school for lunch anymore, which is why I use the ziploc, and when was the last time you actually cleaned your kitchen, you filthy animal?

4) Ziploc method: toss in whatever spices you want. Go crazy. Go nuts. You like regular salt and pepper chips? Whatever blows your hair back, just don't try to kiss me. This is the time for you to break away from the drudgery of your soul sucking job to get creative! If you're doing it the other way, just sprinkle your spices directly on the chips. 

5) Ziploc method: shake that bag of triangles like your worst enemy's neck until all the triangles are evenly coated. I like to hit my dog in the face with it. Goes over real well. After shaking

6) You can spray them again if you want. I like to do this because I believe that God won't let the chips cook evenly unless I do this. Fucker.

6) Bake at 325 for about 15 minutes. 

7) Enjoy! 

** Note: you can forgo the olive oil altogether and just use cooking spray if you want. I've done this before, spray liberally (thanks, Obama), and then do your spices.

***Another note: if you want to go all out fattening and greasy and terrible, stupid.

So the price breakdown is this:

1-20 count package of tortillas: $1.25 

1-32 oz bottle of olive oil: ~$6 (depending on brand

Spices-you should already have a decent stockpile of spices from  which you can choose

Cooking Spray- $1.39 (I use store brand; PAM is about $1 more)

Ziploc baggies-Ziploc is actually not the brand I use

So to go out and buy all the ingredients (less spices, and all the ""ingredients"" can cross-over for other cooking needs. If you use foil &amp; ziploc there is literally no mess to clean up, and you can go from being a sucker with no chips to being a winner with lots of tasty chips in ~15 min with only ~3 minutes of prep time.

For maximum enjoyment

That's enough for me
",self,t5_2si9h,1356648582.0,,green,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/15j3x9/the_things_we_love_an_rbudgetfoods_compilation/
1360596480.0,18b8fj,"I'm tired of all these crappy pizza ideas here - how about this - making your own great tasting pizza, with your own homemade sauce and dough - for about $2 a pie?",stabsthedrama,255,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/18b8fj/im_tired_of_all_these_crappy_pizza_ideas_here_how/, but it's worth it

**Disclaimer**: the only thing you really should buy is a decent pizza stone(s). Unglazed tile used to be sold at like every Home Depot and Lowes for like $.50 - $1.00 a tile

Also, the sauce will fill up a small mason jar with the below recipe (enough for ~10-20 pies) and keep it in the fridge for ~a month.  I also make enough dough for 3-4 pies, use enough for one that night and freeze the rest individually.  It isn't any more work to make more than 1 serving - especially with the sauce.  Even if you cut the sauce recipe in half, it's enough for ~3-4 pies.

**Pizza Dough:**

* ~~1 (.25 ounce) package~~ active dry yeast  **edit:** - After making it a lot and taking advice here, though.
* 1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
* 2 cups bread flour
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 teaspoons white sugar

Dissolve yeast in warm water for about 10 minutes. Combine dry ingredients and olive oil. Add yeast/water. Beat until stiff, upwards of a few hours (or days) if you want (I usually make enough for 3-4 pies at once, let enough for one rise for at least an hour and use it that night, and let the rest rise for a few hours before freezing it).

Honestly

**Pizza sauce:**

All pizza sauces have the same main ingredients:

* 1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
* 1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
* 1 1/2 teaspoons dried minced garlic
* Add a little bit of sugar
* 1 tsp paprika
* 1 tbsp Italian Seasoning*
* 1 tsp Fennel Seed

I recommend getting a thing of ""italian seasonings"" (about $3

All these spices last a long time anyway. I think the total cost of the sauce (without having to buy the spices) is like $1-2? I always try to get a lot of tomato sauce/paste when it goes on sale for this and other recipes anyway.  Just be careful not to add too much garlic or other spices - and if you do, as there are a few other recipes I can use the half can of tomato paste for the next day or so (enchilada sauce comes to mind)

Also, the sauce will fill up a small mason jar with the below recipe (enough for ~10-20 pies) and keep it in the fridge for ~a month.  I also make enough dough for 3-4 pies, use enough for one that night and freeze the rest individually.  It isn't any more work to make more than 1 serving - especially with the sauce.  Even if you cut the sauce recipe in half, it's enough for ~3-4 pies.
When the dough rises - don't work it too much!  Use a good amount of flour to keep it from getting sticky.  ""Knuckle"" it just a bit, and it will not let you shape it/get it too thin without being extremely elasticy.  Takes a few tries to get it right.

I'm still getting good at working with the dough - but I can say this to people who are new to it:  **use parchment paper!**  - I have read many places that a lot of people do this

How I do it, kinda picking it up and working it into a circle.  Once it's basically the shape you want - transfer it onto a cookie sheet with a sheet of parchment paper on top of it with corn meal sprinkled on the paper.  From there, just slide the paper and finished pizza onto the stones.  (all of these steps could pretty much be skipped with a decent wooden pizza peel, ~$20) 

Also

This really depends on your oven - but I would recommend keeping the stones at the bottom rack, or take it out about halfway done when the crust is crispy enough. (I am not guaranteeing anything, but I have never had a problem with leaving the paper in, at the most it will brown its edges) - Put a cookie sheet at the top rack to ""block"" the heat from the top burner once it is preheated, this will keep the cheese from baking too fast and let the crust crisp more. (thanks /u/chadcf!)

**edit:** - I may have been a bit low on the price, and at the most $5 is the most you'll spend per pie.  This is all dependent on toppings.  Cheese and pepperoni will never be ""cheap"", as far as I can tell there aren't too many places to get them dirt cheap, but I'm always looking.

Also - This may look difficult, try new things in the kitchen.  I'm tired of seeing ""101 ways to spruce up your Ramen"" or PBJ, hotdogs, etc. here.  You can still eat great on a budget, and I will be posting a few more of my favorite dirt cheap recipes here.   Also - for anyone new to cooking- Watch Good Eats!!!  You will learn a lot from Alton Brown.  In this instance (pizza) maybe not too much - he likes doing it on the grill - so if that interests you, check out those episodes.

**edit 2:** /u/chadcf had some awesome tips in his comment - namely putting a baking sheet on the top rack to keep the pizza (at the bottom rack) from having its cheese bake too quickly.  This was a problem I was learning my way around until I read that idea.  Will be trying tonight,False,self,t5_2si9h,1360688202.0,,,t3_18b8fj

1. I use a pint of heavy cream and a small can of sweetened condensed milk. It makes quite a bit, and use a mixer or whisk to form stiff peaks. 

2. Then add in your toppings. Today I made chocolate banana. I used 3 over-ripe bananas (usually can be found heavily discounted at the store), but I like chocolate chunks. Yesterday, I made vanilla blueberry (homegrown blueberries, but I think they're on sale at Kroger this week, as well). 

3. Stick it in some tupperware, stir it up with a rubber spatula or spoon (this helps make it creamier). I'm not sure exactly how long it takes to get to full-fledged ice cream status...I never remember to pay attention...but it's not too long! 

It's cheaper even than buying store-brand

This most likely would come out around 1700 calories a person,000 to maintain our weight.

I wanted to say ""thanks"" for the inspiration.  I try to eat healthy, and who wants to make full meals when ramen is so much easier?

The last few weeks, ""That smells *amazing,* what is it?""  or ""I eat 'Campbells' all the time!  What flavor is that?""  It's been a HUGE money and time saver, and today I made two separate soups (16 meals worth!) in about an hour.  Each soup had a dozen different ingredients, including remnants and leftovers and fresh produce, and for the first time I was curious enough to see what it cost me.

Total cost of ingredients I bought today that went into the soup ~$20.  Everything else were ingredients I've had in my pantry and fridge

So, and also love that I'm not the only one out there that worries about the cost of food, and being healthy and sustainable at the same time.

When someone asks what basics they should have in their pantry, but I know very few people posting here are going to have use for stuff like ground cloves or brown rice syrup, so I'm not going to recommend them for general use.

Therefore

* Salt
* Pepper
* Olive oil. It's extremely healthy
* A lighter oil for baking, but I prefer using coconut oil. 

So that's our foundation. Here's what I would consider an ""intermediate list."" Here are spices you'll find quite often in most cuisines. 

* Fresh garlic. It lasts a long time when stored properly and tastes a lot better than garlic powder. 
* Red pepper flakes
* Cumin. You'll find this used in a lot of budget recipes. 

If you want to cook Asian food or basic stir-fries

* Fresh ginger. Lasts a long time when stored properly and can also be frozen for long-term use.
* Soy sauce 
* Sesame Oil


That should give a well-rounded basis to start cooking from. Any spices or oils not on this list are highly dependent on your diet and what types of cuisines you like to cook.

___
___

**Pantry Goods** 

* Oats. Steel cut
* Rice. Like I've said before
* Pasta. Egg noodles are good for casseroles, elbow for some great mac and cheese or maybe a pasta salad.
* Dried Beans. I don't need to go over this
* Dried Lentils. Faster than beans
* Breadcrumbs. Preferably [homemade](http://www.makeandtakes.com/homemade-bread-crumbs).
* Saltines. I love to snack on them
* Ramen. How can we deny our good old cheap sodium-laden friend? He's gotten many of us through hard times.
* Flour. It's cheap and it's a main component in delicious homemade [rustic bread](http://www.goodlifeeats.com/2010/09/rustic-rosemary-garlic-bread.html)
* Sugar. Especially if you like to bake, brown, and powdered sitting around.
* Instant Yeast. Buy a bag and keep it in the freezer. Don't bother with those little packets.
* Vinegar. [Here's](http://busycooks.about.com/od/quicktips/qt/vinegartips.htm) a good guide as to when to use which vinegar.
* Olive oil or vegetable oil. I'm not a food snob
* Garlic. Many people buy fresh. To be honest
* Peanut Butter. Great in oatmeal
* Green Tea. If you're like me and don't like to drink water
* Dehydrated Potato Flakes. Are they gross? I think so. Some people like them better than real mashed potatoes. I use them to thicken potato soup if need be. 
* Flour (and Corn) Tortillas. I hear it's very easy to make your own. Try it out.
* Nutella. This is technically superfluous, or a cheaper knock-off brand (Nutkao is good, but I've only found it at Big Lots.)

___

**Canned Goods**

* Black Beans. Good for a quick chili
* Kidney Beans. Chili
* Tuna. I've seen suggestions for adding it to rice or to mac and cheese (my favourite), or a delicious tuna salad sandwich.
* Tomatoes. I make sure to always have tomato paste
* Broth. Chicken, more power to you! You rock.
* Store-brand canned or jarred spaghetti sauce. Not the best
* Fruits. Is fresh better? Sure. But where are you going to get fresh fruits when the zombies come, in Asian foods, or with cottage cheese!

___

**Spices

* Onion Powder. Most of these types of spices can be found at Aldi's Kroger
* Garlic Powder.
* Red Chili Flakes. Kick it up a notch. Especially ramen.
* Cinnamon. Back to oatmeal.
* Oregano. Helpful for when your canned spaghetti sauce just isn't cutting it.
* Cumin. Instantly makes Mexican food better.
* Soy Sauce.
* Worcestershire Sauce. My life would be boring without it.
* Sriracha. Put that shit on ERRYTHANG.
* Tobasco
* Miracle Whip or Mayonnaise. Need it for tuna/pasta/chicken salads
* Mustard.
* Ketchup
* Lemon Juice. A large $1 bottle at Aldi's is good for both cooking and for mixing with water and sugar to make lemonade!
* Salsa. Who doesn't love salsa on their eggs or burritos?

___

**In the Fridge and Freezer**

* Milk. If you don't use a lot
* Sour Cream. Great on Mexican foods
* Butter. To be 100% honest
* Eggs. Cheap
* Cheese. Whatever kind tickles your fancy. Except Kraft Singles. That's a waste of precious funds. 
* Cottage Cheese
* Bags of frozen veggies. Although if you prefer canned
* Meats. As far as this goes, ground beef, on-sale cuts of meat, bacon, sausage, hot dogs, get whatever you want, keep your frugal budget hat on.

___

**Produce**

* Bananas. Great for smoothies, freeze them, and put them in a smoothie.
* Apples. Keeps the doctor away and whatnot.
* Onions. I put onions in *everything*. They're cheap and bring a lot to the table
* Potatoes. Useful
* Green onions. 
* A leafy green. Pick your favourite.
* Carrots. Not baby ones

___ 
___
___

Remember
Be creative

**Tips**

*Make sure you cycle through your goods, put it on your list. That way if you can't buy it immediately, you still have some left. I hate being out of things I use all the time!
* Some things may not be wise to buy in bulk. If you have the space and you KNOW you're going to use it, if you don't drink Nesquik mix, don't get it! It'll just take up space. 
* Onions and potatoes are usually safe to buy at least a couple bags

Basically I just put my rice into the rice cooker.  while it was cooking I sauteed the onion, corn, and one can of tomatoes and added those to the skillet along with the spices.  I used the juices from one of the cans of tomatoes so it wouldn't be too dry, and brought it to a simmer.  Once the rice was done, I just zapped the tortillas with a damp paper towel and put the burritos together.  I ate one last night, and wrapped the rest in saran wrap and threw them in a freezer bag.  They are super easy to grab for lunch at work or a quick dinner at home.  Just throw them in the microwave, or throw in a ksillet to get a bit crispy.

I dont have a membership or vehicle so my costco trips are few and far between. What are some good things I should stock up on?

Right now my list is just

* eggs
* canned beans / lentils (depending on price)
* paper towel
* body wash
* shampoo
* vegetable oil

**POST COSTCO TRIP UPDATE**

post costo report: if you're in Ontario the boneless skinless chicken prices were shit- $6 / lb!! But the whole / quartered chicken prices were more reasonable. Shampoo was more expensive per bottle than what I could get from Shoppers. Kirkland instant coffee was more expensive than I'd have liked- I generally buy folgers or maxwell when there's sales- it wasn't even close enough to the price I'd want to justify the convenience of not waiting for the next sale on folgers

Things I got great deals on

* coke cans are on sale 8.99 for 32 (about 28 cents / can), 96 cans from No Frills would require numerous trips
* They didnt have the frozen veggies I wanted and what they did have the prices didn't look too remarkable
* Got kirland laundry powder 7 cents / load
* 16L veg oil for $21
* old spice body wash ~2$ per bottle
* Palmolive jug of dish soap
* kirkland recycled paper towels
* eggs - 30 for 6.99 - 23c / egg
* I can't recall how much I normally pay for peppercorns, this was more convenience than savings.

1/2 lb. - 3/4 lb. ground beef

1 can spicy chili beans

1/4 cup of whatever *hot* salsa is on hand

2 tbsp. Cholula hot sauce (or whatever your favorite hot sauce is. Sriracha would also be excellent.)

1 tbsp. onion flakes

2-4 tsp. cinnamon (true Cinncinnati chili is REALLY cinnamon-y)

1 tbsp. chili powder

1.5 tbsp. Heinz ketchup

3-4 dashes salt/pepper (to taste)


(Measurements for spices are approximations. I usually add dashes of everything until the chili is bold and spicy with a subtle cinnamon taste.)


1) Brown beef in a pot over medium-high heat.

2) After beef is adequately browned

3) Add salsa, cinnamon, chili powder, ketchup, and salt/pepper. Stir chili.

4) IF the chili is a bit too thick for your liking (it's really thick at this point)

5) Bring up heat to a boil.

6) Reduce heat (again)

(Serves 1-2)

To buy everything from the store would be around $20

1 Tblsp. Brown Sugar (light is used here but dark works)

1-2 Tblsp. Margarine

Mix all ingredients except onion and margarine. Set aside. 

Melt margarine in a skillet. Add onions and saute for a few minutes. 

Add the hot dogs and roll 'em around for a minute or two. 

Pour the sauce mix over the hot dogs. Simmer for 10-20 minutes.

Serves 4-8.

Variations: If you don't have onion you can use 2 Tblsp. dry onion in the seasoning aisle OR use 1-2 tsp onion powder.

You can also mince 2 cloves of garlic and add that to the onion and margarine and not the sauce mix.

Approx. cost: $15-20

Approx. servings: 8-10

Ingredients:

2 cups (8 oz) brown rice
1 sweet onion
1 red bell pepper
1 yellow bell pepper
1 can beans (black or pinto)
1 can corn (unsalted)
1 can diced beets
1 can diced carrots
1 can diced tomatoes
1 package of uncooked pork sausage links 
1/3 bottle of dry white wine
Large assortment of spices and hot sauce of your choice

Also, bits of steak, etc. because it needs more meat.

Directions:

Cook rice as directed on package. Don't burn it like I did on the first attempt. Also

Meanwhile

Cook sausages as directed on package. Set sausage grease aside in one of the empty cans of vegetables. Once cooked

Once rice is finished cooking to al dente, diced tomatoes (with liquid from the can), and all other vegetables (without liquid from the can). Throw on an assortment of spices and hot sauce from your cabinet. 

Mix ingredients well and move to a large skillet. Set heat to medium-low and add a few ounces of white wine and sausage grease to taste. Cover and let simmer for a few minutes until wine is cooked away. Continue this process of adding wine and cooking it off while covered until at least 1/4 bottle of wine or more has been thoroughly cooked into the mixture and rice is soft.

Serve and/or save leftovers for later.

Eat it like a brown bear. Drink the remaining 2/3 bottle of wine.

* 1 egg (hardboiled)
* milk or cream
* one package spicy Chinese mustard that you found at the back of the fridge cuz it was like 3AM and you were out of hot sauce
* Assorted spices (I like to use basil and oregano)

**How to**


1. Prepare ramen noodles like you would if you were just regularly making ramen noodles. Do not mix in the flavoring packet yet. Do not drain the water all the way. Drain the water from the noodles about half way

2. Cook ground beef with the seasonings you intend to put in your ramen. Add to cooked ramen.

3. Add however much milk/cream you want. It makes the broth a little thicker. Add until kind of a creamy brown.

4. Add spices to taste.

5. Cut up hard boiled egg. I like to take most of the yolk out of my eggs and just add the whites to my broth.

6. Add spicy mustard on top

I was on my way home from work, so I looked there.  $1.60 for seven drumsticks isn't bad: take it home, coat it with salt, pepper, and garlic, and microwave it at half-power for 40 minutes.  Voila - a decent meal for one, for under two dollars.

And for no real reason, cheap dishes one could make for under $2...and if you're living on a tight budget (as many of us are), then you've probably learned a few tricks on how to take cheap food and jazz it up to make it more appealing.

I'm not very creative when it comes to cooking, as long as it's cheap.  And there's nothing wrong with using the old stand-by that many starving artists and college students live on .

2. Let the onions brown; this will take about 10-15 minutes. I diced up my onions and garlic

3. When the onions are beginning to caramelize

4. Turn the heat down to medium

5. Add the beans and tomatoes to the pot. Reserve the bean juice; use it to thin the chili if you think it needs it. I didn't wind up needing my bean juice

6. Stir that bitch together and let it simmer for a while

8. Taste and season as you like. I used probably a teaspoon of sriracha, more or less.

EDIT: More info

Weekly budget: $50-$75

No dietary or meal preferences/requirements. I'm not allergic to anything and I like most foods (can't think of anything off the top of my head that I actively avoid)

Equipment: pots &amp; pans of various sizes, &amp; a blender. I may not like to cook, but I do it often enough to have the proper tools. 

Generally 10-14 meals a week at home with about 1/2-2/3 of them ""cooked"" (meaning more involved than using the microwave).

I generally don't eat breakfast aside from grabbing a fruit (apple or orange) as I walk out the door. I live close enough to work to come home for lunch (gives me about 30-40 minutes at home. Enough time to make a sandwich or heat up leftovers) and generally cook dinner. On the weekends it's usually just lunch and dinner.

**Equipment:**

If you have a large slow-cooker, but it works out the same either way.  You’ll need something to store leftovers in too, or a crowd of friends to eat your food.

**Food:**

5-6 lb pork butt
2 onions
2 green peppers
4 carrots
1 lb brown rice
1 lb pinto beans
Vegetable of your choice
Sugar

I bought all but the seasonings on a trip to the discount store (Buy4Less here, but in my area you can buy 1 lb bags of each for $0.99.  The green peppers were on sale, which was lucky for me; but in a given shopping trip you’ll probably find something on sale, right?  Total cost for me was well under $25, but I’ll round up to that to account for seasonings, energy, amortized equipment and all the rest.

Season the meat the night before you cook and let it sit overnight.  You can pick a spice rub recipe that you like

6 Tbs brown sugar  
2 Tbs salt  
1 Tbs paprika  
2 tsp cumin  
1 tsp garlic powder  
1 tsp black pepper  

It might look like a lot of salt, put it back in the fridge and let it sit overnight.

Soak the beans in water too

The next day, and cut them all up into big chunks.  Time to pick your cooking method!

**All-day-while-I’m-at-work method:**  pour the cut-up veggies into the bottom of the slow cooker, turn it on low and let it cook all day (at least 8 hours).

**Slow-cooker-but-not-all-day method:**  as above

**Conventional-oven-method:**  I use my favorite pot for this, lay the meat on top.  Scoop veggies up the sides as needed so that the lid will fit without touching the meat.  Add water to within an inch of the top, but not so much that you submerge the meat.  Put the lid on and place in the oven at 400 for an hour, then lower the temperature to where the liquid is barely bubbling; for my oven that’s 260.  Simmer for an additional 4-5 hours.

So, allowing me to extract the bone; if it works out that way for you, keep the bone with the soup.

Now to make your beans!  Pour off the water that the beans soaked in, add the beans and the soup to a big pot on the stove.  Turn up the heat to high and let the beans boil in the soup for a few minutes, then reduce the heat to a slow simmer and cook them until soft, usually about 1.5 hours.  I leave the pot uncovered, as I always have more soup than I need for the beans and want to cook off some of the liquid.  If your soup has a layer of fat on top, you can skim that off before adding beans and cooking.  (Personally, I leave it and let the beans soak it up.)

Cook the rice according to package instructions.  I use a rice cooker for this, as the rice cooks faster.

For me it seems to work out that the soup veggies have mostly broken down by the time the beans are ready

When the beans and rice are ready, and put big chunks of pork around the edges.

This is a good example of big-batch cooking

Stretch this farther by doubling the beans and rice

I was a vegetarian from 6th grade to my sophomore year in high school. Unfortunately though, all the time. So I've decided to try going veg again, but this time actually doing it the right way. 

I'm a decent cook overall and I know how to make most of the basics. I have the ingredients (pastas, veggies, tofu, cheeses, spices), but I'm kinda stuck on what to do with them. I remember being really bored trying to cook for myself when I was a vegetarian back in the day, so this time I want to try to spice things up. 

I'm basically looking for any little gems you have (and are willing to share!) to help me stick to my plan of eating cheap, so that's why I'm writing here. I've looked around on the internet and I find a lot of recipes that require a lot of time and specific ingredients, which I don't have much of at the moment.

Thanks a lot

Open a can of beer or cider (standard UK can 18oz)

Rub the chicken all over with oil (olive is best but anything will do)

Place chicken in a roasting pan and into oven. 2 hours on 180 degrees or until skin is nice and crispy brown and juices run clear when bird is stabbed.

Take out of oven and let it rest/cool. Lift the chicken off the can. Pour the can contents into the roasting pan. (If done correctly this will be a delicious mix of beer and chicken juice - this will be the base for your gravy).

I strip all the meat from the carcass and put aside the leg meat and dark meat for soup.

The white meat I use with gravy or for caesar salads

Take the carcass and skin

Pour though a sieve - this is your stock and will give you about 3-4 pints. Put the carcass

When your stock is cool

You'll be left with about 2 pints of beautiful delicious stock which you can freeze and use for soups and such.

Soup: Chop two red onions, stir this into the veg, then add 1 pint stock and 1 pint water. Simmer this mixture until the veg is cooked through, then shred up all your soup chicken and add to the broth. Season with herbs, salt and pepper. You can add noodles to stretch it further but this lasts me for about 3 days having a good bowlful per day.

Gravy: Take the roasting pan with beer/chicken juice and put over heat. When bubbling, make sure you scrape all the sticky crunchy bits from the pan bottom to add awesome flavour. This can be frozen as well.

**Ingredients:**

* Dry or Wet Jerk Spices ($5-$8 at any grocery store or Jamaican grocer.)
* Skinless chicken breast (I got two for $8.40 at Loblaws)
* Olive oil (I can't remember. $4?)

**Cookware:**

* Tinfoil
* Baking tray
* Optional: Two small plates

**Instructions:**

*Note: You can substitute the small plates for basically anything that won't absorb stuff. When I say ""small plate"" consider making a tinfoil plate or using some Tupperware. Whatever. I hate when recipes restrict you to certain items.*

* Set the oven to bake at 175 C/350 F
* Put a strip of tinfoil over your baking sheet
* Wash your chicken breast thoroughly (I ran mine under tepid water on both sides for a little bit)
* On one small plate pour some olive oil.
* Let the chicken breast take in the oil. Or whatever it's doing. I let the breast sit in the oil on each side for about thirty seconds.
* On the other small plate have some jerk spice ready.
* Place the oiled chicken breast down on the spice and then flip and do that for the other side.
* Rub the jerk spices into the chicken breast. Your hands are going to get gross from the oil and spices
* Place the breast on the tinfoil covered baking sheet and then put that in your oven (once it's been heated).
* Cook for 40 minutes.
* Remove and enjoy!

I made this tonight and I was surprised by how delightful it was. For cutlets I'd reduce the time to 30 minutes

I wanted to share this recipe because I was sick of not being able to find simple chicken breast recipes in the internet and I just really like putting jerk spice on stuff. If you remove the step about the jerk spices

olive oil ($0.10)
2lbs Tilapia (I just paid $8 today)
1 smoked ham hock ($1)
1 medium spanish onion ($0.75)
1 quart fish stock (usually free as you're just taking out their trash)
3/4 pound yukon gold potatoes ($0.75)
dried thyme (1/16th of a $3 bottle)
1 qt whole milk ($1)

We'll start with the fish stock.  Ask your fish market for left over fish bones.  Any decent market will have been asked before.  If all they sell is frozen fish, halibut, bass)  They're the secret to many great fish recipes.  Just cover them with water in a pot and simmer for about 30 minutes.  Press them through a strainer until clearish... don't worry about it too much.  This ain't for a Michelin star.

Fish stock can be frozen forever (almost).  I save them in leftover pint containers... as a lot of times you don't need/want a lot of stock.  Clam juice could be used instead

*Dice up the spanish onion
*Soften the onion in the olive oil in a decent sized pot
*add the ham hock... 
*once the onion is softened add the fish stock... 
*simmer for 1-2 hrs
*remove the ham hock
*add a bit of thyme to the simmering broth
*dice the potato (skinned or not) and add to broth
*cube up the talapia and add on top of the potatoes 
*let simmer until the potatoes are almost cooked
*warm up the milk in a separate pot (if you add cold milk to hot broth it could curdle on you)
*pour the milk into the rest of the broth... simmer if you want to thicken it... or you could add a roux if you're really in trouble.

Salt.

as it cools it will thicken...

so that's about $12.50 for about 10 servings of seafood chowder

The tilapia will probably shred while simmering.  This gives your chowder a great texture.  If you want larger chunks split the tilapia in half

I'm looking for suggestions to replace the Pasta and Chilli we usually eat since it's cheap and easy to buy in plannable bulk. (aka- 10 Pasta boxes... 10 meals!). 

I will consider derivatives of the above, etc that isn't 'Tomato Sauce' or 'Alfredo'. (I'm tired of both.)

If a list of implements is needed--- we have a Frying Pan. Sauce Pot. Microwave. Various bowls and dishes, a Sauce Spoon, a Spaghetti Fork. I think we have a small crock pot/slow cooker. 

**We DO NOT** have an Oven. (Efficiency Apartment means just two burners on a hot plate! The Hot plate boils stuff, but it won't get hot enough to 'Deep Fry' things like 'fried chicken' 'french fries', etc.) Also, for the same reason (Small apartment!), making food in bulk to store back isn't a possibility (unless it doesn't need refrigeration), the fridge is impossibly small (Think Hotel Mini Fridge), so it's easier for the things you suggest to be made from scratch regularly easily. 

EXTREMELY Spicy foods (Such as Curry, the hubby cannot--- they'll fuck his stomach up and he'll be sent to the ER.  Also, recipes that are /heavy/ on beans aren't optimal, as neither me or the hubby like them very much.

Food doesn't necessarily need to be 'health conscious'. It just kinda needs to be actual food. ;P.

Suggestions appreciated!

**tl;dr?**: Me and Hubby Tired of Fricken Pasta &amp; Sauce and Chilli most of the time since it's cheap and easy to buy in bulk and repeat. Suggest something else that can also be bought in bulk and cooked easily that isn't 'Pasta and Sauce' or 'Chilli'.

**Unasked for Background Information!:** We usually buy lots of Pasta/Sauce and Chilli (50 cents-1.00 a can of Chilli, because it's cheap, and easy to cook and we don't need to rush to eat it, because it won't go bad by the end of the month, or even a few months! The Chilli also goes good on Pasta and /or Rice, too, or on top of Hotdogs But we've eaten it for so long that it's actually starting to taste kinda like sawdust

**Additonal, or could be made to do so, at the minimum in terms of shelf-life. We are mostly looking for stuff at the end of the month, when all the perishable yummies, like the ground beef, and meats and creamy stuff like Milk are gone.

**MOAR EDIT!:** A Chest freezer will never be a possibility for me, and one of them is used by the fridge, and the other, is switched between the microwave and hot plate. This is an efficiency apartment ('Efficiency' is the Apartment Class before 'Studio', it means a small room, and no kitchenette area.) , and they keep prices low by pumping two different voltages into the plugs here depending on it's location/load (So if I plug a chest freezer into one of the other plugs here,,1367260963.0,t3_1dbq9y

* 2 tablespoons bacon grease (I just had this in a jar from the last time I made bacon... I always save it. If you don't have bacon grease

* one medium-sized onion

* 4 cloves garlic

* a 14.5-oz (or thereabouts) can of chicken broth/stock

* about 3/4 of a cup of some sort of tomato-ish substance (I used Trader Joe's tomato and garlic pasta sauce because it was what I had on hand

* a good squirt of ketchup (the reason I used ketchup in addition to my tomato pasta sauce is because ketchup has vinegar in it... adds a bit of tanginess)

* 2 or 3 teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce (I didn't measure

* cayenne pepper or chili powder to taste (I also added in a bunch of Cholula hot sauce because I like things to be on the spicy side)

* salt and pepper to taste

* 3 15.5-oz cans of black beans

* some lime juice if you have it

Melt the bacon grease in the bottom of a large heavy pot, tomatoey whatever-the-fuck, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper, and chili powder/cayenne/hot sauce. Add the beans, turn the heat up to high, turn the heat down until it's simmering, or with a dollop of sour cream

Oil (canola

Salt

Water

Extra budget ingredients:

Cut up bacon (a half a pack to a full pack

Clamato juice (substitute the water in the slow cooker/dutch oven with clamato)

Time to get at it:

First you need to toss those lima beans in a BIG bowl and cover them with water. Toss them in the fridge overnight so they can soak up some water. Then

Now for a little prep work. Chop your onions and garlic (combine them or keep them separate

Layer time! In your crock pot (or dutch oven or casserole dish, then go up the list for what goes on what):

Water or Clamato

A *little* oil

Sprinkle of salt

Squirt of ketchup

Sprinkle of brown sugar

Bacon

Onions

Garlic

Beans

The more layers you can make with the ingredients you have, maybe even a little extra if you plan on overnighting these babies in your slow cooker.

Get your slow cook on

Or, the beans are done when they're tender. I don't usually do it this way, but I'd estimate at least a few hours before you can get your baked beans on.

These beans are my favorite Thanksgiving or potluck contribution

I really like this recipe because it's so simple at its heart but you can really easily expand on it and add things to make it your own. Plus it's easy
  
###Recipe:  

**Ingredients:**    
(to make 12 rolls)  


* Store bought pre-rolled puff pastry - Usually £1.50

* Approx 6 sausages worth of sausage meat (you can buy sausage meat on its own or just take the meat out of sausages yourself) - £2 from the butcher  
* A few tablespoons of milk or a beaten egg - already in the kitchen  
* Optional extras  
  
  
**Method**  

* Preheat the oven to 200 degrees C  (400F
* Flatten out your pre-rolled puff pastry  
* [Cut it in half length ways](http://i.imgur.com/Ex6A6)  
* [Cut it width ways so that you have 12 rectangles of pastry](http://i.imgur.com/btKr5)  
* Roll a ball of sausage meat just small enough for the rectangle of pastry to wrap around it and overlap on itself a little  
* Place the sausage meat in the centre of the rectangle of pastry (this is the point at which you can start adding extras
* Lightly brush the rest of the pastry with milk or beaten egg  
* Roll the pastry around the meat  
*  Pinch the sides of the pastry together  
* Lightly score the top of the roll with a knife (for decoration)  
* Brush the top of the roll with milk or beaten egg  
*  Bake! They should take approximately 30-35 minutes and go a lovely golden colour

You will need:

* Cream cheese
* STAG chili
* Shredded cheese
* Any tortilla chips
* An oven

***

1. Grab a deep, too.

2. Line the bottom of the pan evenly with about 1/4 inch

3. Pour in that STAG chili. Make *just* noticeably thicker than the cream cheese layer.

4. Cover evenly in shredded cheese

5. Put in oven about 10 minutes. Make sure that cheese is all melted up.

And that's my recipe! My girlfriend's family and I (7 total) chowed down on this last night out of a great big roasting pan. Add a bit of hot sauce too for a little heat (My favorite is WhoopAss Hot Sauce.)

If a Republican ran on a platform of MORE DELICIOUSNESS FOR ALL AMERICANS

There are a lot of salsa recipes below, and then another red salsa that comes out hot (temperature wise). Also, a creamy cilantro sauce, which is by no means ""healthier"" than anything, but it's really good and cheap to make, and makes for a good dip for a party or when you're crying alone in a dark room because Emma Watson finally blocked your creepy ass on twitter. You'll also find a pico de gallo, which is not only super budget, easy, but I'm including it because it's awesome and you might get a $5 windfall sometime soon

A warning: I do a lot of ""eyeballing"" in my cooking

So! Let's get started!

**Classic Red Salsa**

*This is a classic salsa similar to what you might buy at the store or find in restaurants. Goes great with chips

Ingredients:

* 3 or 4 whole tomatoes. *Whatever kind you want. Roma are typically cheapest

* 1 whole jalapeno, and gut the seeds. BE CAREFUL! Don't be a dumbass and wipe your eyes or pick your nose after doing this without washing your hands several times. Vinegar also helps to neutralize jalapeno on hands.* 

* As much fuckin' garlic as you want. *I usually use 5 or 6 cloves, because that doesn't sound right.*

* 1 bunch of cilantro. *I like to trim the stems off

* Juice of 1 large lime. *If you need me to go into greater detail

* 1 medium size onion, beliefs like there can never be too much onion in things. I'm pretty sure it's in our Constitution, beneath the part where it says we can secede from the rest of you.*

* 1 or 2 small (8 oz) cans of tomato sauce. *I said 1 or 2 because you can choose your desired level of thickness. I don't like my salsa too thick, then go nuts.*

* Chili powder. *Start off with a few tbls

* Comino

* S &amp; P to taste

I use a food processor, an animal? 

There is no crazy science to this. Literally just throw everything into your processor or blender until it's as chunky or smooth as you want. Taste along the way, it's not your mother.

**Price Breakdown**

Tomatoes: ~$1

Jalapeno:10¢

Garlic: 50¢ (for a whole bulb)

Cilantro: ~50¢

Lime: 20¢

Onion: ~60¢ (I get a 4 lb bag of onions for 3 or 4 bucks)

Tomato sauce: 33¢ each

Spices-- I want to reiterate how important it is to have a nice stockpile of a variety of spices on hand

For less than 5 bucks (rounding up)

**Heated Red Salsa**

*This is a variation of the classic salsa with some tweaks

* 4 vine-ripe or 6 roma tomatoes

* 1 small white onion, I'm a vegetilosopher*

* 3 cloves of garlic

* 1 whole jalapeno, moron, touch your genitals later*

* 1 tbl olive oil *I know

* 2 tsp of ground comino *for this specific recipe, but regular ground comino works fine*

* 1 tsp cayenne pepper *Now we're talking, I guess. I don't think it'd kill anyone, unless they were standing on a cliff.*

* S &amp; P to taste 

Throw it all in a small saucepan on low heat. Heat for about 20 min on low heat. If you want it smooth like Barry White, that's cool, but make sure everything is nice and minced and/or diced. I use a hand blender directly in the pot, works like a hooker in Vegas.

**Price Breakdown**

Tomatoes: Vine Ripened: ~$2.50

Onion: ~60¢

Garlic: 50¢ for a bulb

Jalapeno: 10¢

Olive Oil: A low end bottle costs ~$6. Olive oil is pretty much a pantry staple

Either way you do this, and it's still awesome.

**Creamy Cilantro Sauce**

*This is exactly what it sounds like--creamy cilantro-y goodness, sauce for tacos in lieu of sour cream, or even as a salad dressing if you thin it out.*

**Ingredients**

* 1 large bunch or 2 small bunches of cilantro *see above for cilantro details*

* 1 Jalapeno *seeded and trimmed. I've reminded you twice to wash your hands

* 1 block of cream cheese. *You can substitute with Neufchatel if your weight watchers meeting is coming up so you're trying to be ""responsible"". I've been there

* 1 heaping tbl of sour cream *Once again

* Juice of 1 large lime

* 1/2 packet of ranch mix (optional) *Adding this lends it own brand of deliciousness, you don't care, you probably laugh at that lipitor guy, you bastard*

* Cayenne--1 tbl

* Chili powder--1 tbl

* S &amp; P to taste

Like the 1st red sauce, and let sit in the fridge for a few hours to set and let the ingredients flirt with, and eventually fuck, each other.

**Price Breakdown**

Cilantro: 50¢ each

Jalapeno: 10¢

Cream Cheese: $1.09 (store brand

Sour Cream: $1.39 for 16 oz tub (store brand

Lime: 20¢

Ranch-Sodium bomb: ~50¢ (store brand)

Comes out to &gt;$4

**Pico de Gallo**

*You've seen pico before. You've seen it at every Tex Mex place you've ever been to. You've poked at it on your plate with your fork

*Serves 3-4 for a healthy garnish

* 2 roma tomatoes

* 1 white onion

* 1 serrano pepper, but she forgives him because serrano is tasty and doesn't look as spicy as it actually is. Serrano is longer, thinner, and a darker shade of green than jalapeno.*

* 1 whole avocado

* 1/2 bunch of cilantro  *just use the leaves here

* Juice of 1 large lime

* S &amp; P to taste

The above is the most standard recipe for pico. Super simple. You just throw everything into a bowl mix it up with a spoon

**Price Breakdown**

Tomatoes: ~60¢

Onion: ~60¢

Serrano: ~15¢

Cilantro: ~50¢

Lime: 25¢

Avocado: ~70¢

This motherfucking salsa's &gt;$3

**Tomatillo Salsa**

*This salsa was in our wedding vows. My husband is legally obligated to make this for me. I'm tough but fair.*

**Ingredients**

* 8 tomatillos  *tomatillos typically come encased in a paper-like shell, genius. Just dice the  fucking peppers.*

* 1 white onion

* 1 jalapeno, and diced

* 3 cloves of garlic

* 1/4 bunch of cilantro *no stems

* 1 small (4 oz) can of diced green chiles 

* 1 cup of sour cream

* S &amp; P to taste

Throw everything except the sour cream together in a medium saucepan on the stovetop, both ways are delicious.  

**Price Breakdown**

Tomatillos: No exact number

Jalapeno: 10¢

Garlic: 50¢ for a bulb

Onion: 60¢

Cilantro: 50¢

Diced green chiles: ~65¢

Sour Cream: $1.39

Total is &gt;$6, as well as sauce for enchiladas and tacos. It can also be a good marinade for meat, which is also something I'm pretty sure she said. Have you noticed she says a lot of dirty things?

* 1 can (400 ml) of crushed tomatoes
*  2 yellow onions
* 1 dl (~1/2 cup) Black olives
* 2 dl (~1 cup) Crème fraîche
* 2 (big) cloves of garlic

1. Heat a pan with the oil and fry the onion on medium heat.
1. The onion should become soft and a little brown. This takes a little while
* If you have tomato ~~puré~~ paste put it in here and mix with the onions and fry it a bit. (Don't put tomato puré directly in tomato sauce since it can become bitter.) 
1. Salt and peppar to your liking
1. Throw in the olives and mix. (pasta sauce finished)

* Mix créme fraîche and chopped garlic and blend well.

Here's my recipe down to the bare bones:

Ingredients:

Rice

Shredded onions and carrots

Spinach 

Zucchini 

Egg

Washed shredded lettuce (optional)

Korean pepper paste

Vegetable or Sesame oil (recommend sesame oil but vegetable oil works great too)

Cook the rice.

Now you might have some trouble with the Korean pepper paste, but as long as it's a bit thick it's fine (its really thick by itself, which is why I water mine down).  I use sprite soda because it gives it a slightly tangy kick, my mom used to use Sunny D sometimes.  It'll also last you quite a while as long as you store it in your fridge (I don't think it ever really goes bad when stored properly, I've had the same pepper paste for a year or two now)

You'll be typically using just a small spoonful per bowl anyway.  You can buy it online or go to your local oriental market to find it.

Lightly stir fry or sauté the onions and carrots (can be done together

Blanch spinach in boiling water for about 15-30 seconds (to kill the bacteria and etc).  Immediately after, you can ball it up and cut it in half (makes it easier to mix in the salt). Add just a pinch of salt to flavor it and mix the salt in with the spinach (this also makes it a great side dish for anything you eat with rice).  You can also add sesame seeds but for simplicities sake, just add some salt.  Put the spinach on the platter when it's done

Now onto the zucchini.  You can either steam, they should be a little translucent.  Put this on the platter when it's done

Fry an egg however you want


Now to prepare it to eat.  Get yourself a bowl of rice, spinach, zucchini, and the optional shredded lettuce on top and around the rice,.  Lastly put the egg on top of it all and put in as much Korean pepper paste as you want.  I recommend with half a spoonful just to get an idea.  If spicy food isn't your thing, you can just barely put any of it in just for the flavoring.  Then get yourself a spoon, mix it all up and enjoy.  You can also add in some sesame oil here if you'd like

If you have left over vegetables

Now lets say you want to put other things on it?  You can saute mushrooms (Shiitake is highly recommended and the norm), but of course that would also make it a bit more expensive to make.

Here's a link to Maangchi's website, fern brakes and meat.  It'll still taste very good. As long as you have some cooked vegetable and and egg, you should be fine.

Mrs. Dash Fiesta Lime seasoning ( pennies

It is done when white in the middle. 


Place in a bowl and break apart with a fork, place approx half the fish on top of cheese. Add a little more cheese on top of the fish ( I do this to ensure good stickiness after cooking.)

With dry beans

This recipe makes about a gallon of chili


Ingredients:

* 
1 28oz can of diced tomatoes
* 
4 cups dry beans. (This expands to about 10-12 cups. I use 2cup pinto, though you can vary this however you like. This is also 6 cans of canned beans if you prefer to save the time; this will raise the price quite a bit.)
* 
2 red onions
* 
2 carrots
* 
1 red bell pepper
* 
2 cobbs of corn (this
* 
1 or 2 habanero peppers (2 will make it pretty spicy
* 
1 or 2 jalapeno peppers (I usually just use 2 habaneros and skip the jalapeno because the price per capsaicin is better. If I'm making it for friends, and 1 anaheim for a wider flavor profile.)
* 
6 cloves of garlic
* 
1+ tablespoon salt (if you use salted canned tomatoes or beans
* 
1+ tablespoon ground black pepper
* 
1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 
1 tablespoon olive or canola oil
* 
(I don't like to use generic chili powder


Directions:
Bean prep: Soak beans in 3x their volume in water for 6 about hours, remove the top layer of foam. Add lid and simmer the beans for about 1 hour. Then drain the beans and leave in the large bowl until later. (If using canned beans, then rinse them, drain them, and leave them in the bowl.)


Now that the beans are in the bowl, and stir in the salt, black pepper, and cumin. Heat until tomato liquid starts boiling. Then add the soaked and drained beans and stir well. Bring this to simmer, cover, and let sit for about 30minutes, stirring occasionally, add the corn. (I usually cut it straight from the cob into the pot). Leave over heat for ~5 more min. Ready to eat or put into fridge/freezer for storage!


A lot of the stuff is to my preferences, or squash. When adding new veggies, put harder ones in earlier with the onions and carrots, softer ones in with peppers. Aside from accidentally under-cooking the beans (skimping time while soaking, or due to altitude), it is really hard to mess this recipe up, so go ahead and experiment.

Add one ball to 6-8 oz of boiling water (it helps to defrost the concentrate a bit first so it mixes easier.)

What we doooo have is a frozen, and some of that weight is surely water. 

I can't figure out how to defrost it safely. 

What can 2 people do with this bad boy to stretch it across a week? There's dinner one night, ham and eggs, Hoppin John I guess, but I figured you guys were geniuses and could steer me towards success. What would you do to make it last?

MUSHROOM MEAT LOAF

* 6-ounce can sliced mushrooms
* 15-ounce can Original Sloppy Joe Sauce
* 1 lb extra-lean Ground Beef
* 1 cup Quaker Quick Oats
* 1 Egg
* 1 tsp Italian Seasoning

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Dump 1/2 can of the sloppy joe sauce and all the other ingredients into a bowl and mix gently. Squish into a football shape on the foil-lined pan from your toaster oven. Bake for 30 minutes. Pour the remaining 1/2 can of sauce over the loaf. Bake for 30 minutes more

Makes 6 servings. 281 calories per serving

**Now forget the canned mushrooms

Fatty meat is cheaper and tastes better

Replace the mushrooms with what sounds good to you

Instead of buying Sloppy Joe sauce, start out with half of it being ketchup (or use all ketchup if you want). Got some barbecue sauce? Mix some in with the ketchup. Got some Worcestershire sauce? Mix it in there too. Got some Honey? Dump it in there.

You really don't even need the quick oats. Got some stale bread around? Crumble it up and use it instead. Not dry enough to crumble

I've used the base of the original recipe to make everything from cheeseburger meatloaf to barbecue meatloaf. 

Below is a concoction that I threw together with what we had around the kitchen that turned out really well.


**Barbecue Meatloaf**

Main Ingredients:

* 1 lb ground beef
* 1 cup Quaker quick oats
* 1 egg
* 5 strips bacon
* 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Sauce: (sauce ingredients are approx)

* 1/2 cup ketchup
* 1/2 cup barbecue sauce
* 2 tbsp Honey
* 3 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
* 2 cloves garlic (pressed/crushed)
* Cayenne pepper (to taste)

Cook the bacon until crispy. While bacon is cooking mix all sauce ingredients. Crush the bacon into bits

Instructions:
***
* Chop up the onion
* Heat up about 3 tbsp of oil in the pan on medium heat. Then fry the pork chop/onions/garlic. Once the pork chop is seared
* Cook the onions and garlic til the onions are clear
* Put about 3 more tbsp of oil in the pan along with the flour. Mix it until the flour integrates with the fat. It doesn't have to be a liquid viscosity, but in the end it's not.
* Add stuff in no particular order: ~7 cups water, beans, rice, chiles, corn.
* Stir everything together
* Add spices: A LOT of black pepper, so I'm pretty liberal with the cayenne. It gets diluted quite a bit with all the liquid.
* Stir
* Cover the pan and cook until the rice is almost done
* Uncover and add herbs
* Serve

Some interesting ways to serve it that I use:

* Smother a tortilla with the rice/beans, and greens.
* Replace the tortilla with tortilla chips and add more greens

Enjoy!

**Ingredients:**

1 lb ground beef

salt and pepper

medium onion chopped

About 3/4 lb or 1 lb of egg noodles (I just get one bag)

2 cans of tomato soup 

about 1 soup can full of water (about 1/2 can of water for every can of soup)

Bread crumbs (optional

**Directions:**

1. Brown the meat in a frying pan with the salt

2. Cook egg noodles (don't cook completely. should be a little firm)

3. Mix the noodles, and water together. Sprinkle breadcrumbs on top.

4. Bake at 325°F for 1 hour

**Note:** This is also really easy to customize. Sometimes I like to throw in some mozzarella cheese and/or chopped spinach as well.

1365431247.0,1bx2tc,Budget Breakfast - Banana Licuado,upward_bound,31,2,1,"Basically a smoothie

Ingredients:

- 1 ripe Banana (The correct ripeness would be when they start to have little black spots all over.  If it has any green then don't use it.  It won't taste good.  If it is too black then just use it for banana bread

- 2 Tbsp of peanut butter (I prefer the one that only has two ingredients [peanuts + salt])

- 1.5c of milk or milk substitute (when I was younger I used 2% milk

- Ice (read directions for amount)

- Few pinches of cinnamon

Directions:

- Put all ingredients except ice into blender

- Put ice in blender.  The amount depends on how you like it and how strong your blender is.  If you have a strong blender and like a good thick smoothie then you can put a decent chunk of ice in there.  Maybe 1/2 to 3/4ths of an ice tray.  If you have a weak blender or like more of a drinking consistency (like me) then you can use just a handful of ice.

- Blend on a medium to high setting.



Price:

- 35 cents for Banana
- 20 cents for Peanut Butter
- 75 cents for Vanilla Almond Milk @ 4 dollars for 8 cups

1.30 total

Variations:

This can be varied greatly depending on the occasion or time of year.  In the summer you might put some strawberries in.  This time of the year you may find mangos on sale.  Check out the frozen section in the winter to see if there is any fruit there that's on sale.  If you want more of a treat you can experiment with adding chocolate syrup and serving with candied nuts on top.

Rotisserie chickens are awesome. They're cheap, and they provide a lot of bang for your buck. You should have flour, butter, and rice sitting around. If you don't, go buy some. They're cheap. Canned vegetables: also cheap. I got 8 cubes of chicken bouillon for 50 cents. 

First, flour, and rice laying around you might have spent $1.20 on a couple cans of vegetables, $5.00 on a rotisserie chicken, and $0.50 on the bouillon. You'll probably get around 4 servings from this. Enjoy.

1344059958.0,xnsyp,Chicken Curry Recipe - Hoping for feedback! (X-post from r/recipes),Tairy__Greene,32,8,22,"I made this after fiddling around with different recipes for chicken tikka masala and other curries and this what I do on a weekly basis. Wondering if this is pretty similar to anything anyone else does

**My Chicken Curry Recipe**

* 1 tablespoon of olive oil (you really only need enough to coat the onions slightly) ~$3
* 
2 Red Onions chopped/minced ~$3.50/lb  which ends up being 4/5 onions
* 
1 spoonful of Ginger Paste (or 2 teaspoons of grated fresh) You can find it near the garlic or near the regular ginger. $2.50
* 
2-3 cloves of chopped/minced Garlic (1 good size spoonful if pre-minced) &lt;$3
* 
1-2 good size spoonfuls of Patak's Mild/Hot Curry Paste. I have gotten it at Kroger in the ethnic aisle
* 
2 cans of Rotel (store brand is tomatoes with green chiles
* 
1 can of black beans
* 
1 can of precooked chicken  $3 or less depending on quality
* 
1/2 cup of basmati rice (or more

Total cost of it all ~$23 
BUT
The oil, curry paste, and rice will last for more than four of these, so even though they are on the high side, it comes out pretty cheap for something that I can eat about 3 times before it's gone, and you could stretch it to 4 or more servings depending on the amount of rice you use.

Saute the onions in the oil over medium-low heat (setting 4/10 is good for me) stirring enough so they don't stick or burn. When they become almost fully translucent add the ginger and garlic. Mix them all together and cook for a couple minutes, if it is canned chicken add it now and coat it in the curry paste veggie mixture. Once you do that you can add the Rotel and black beans and 2/3 of a cup of water. Feel free to turn the heat up (no more than 7/10) and let the water cook out of it all. When it is slightly more saucy and runny than you want it when you eat it, cover it and turn the heat down to ~3. While the water was cooking out you should be preparing the rice. The most important part of the rice is rinsing it, make sure you rinse it off until the water is no longer cloudy, just fill up a pot of water and add the rice, stir it and pour the water off. After you rinse it just add the same amount as you would normal rice 1 cup of water to every half cup of rice. Bring it to a boil and as soon as it starts, turn the heat down to simmer and put a lid on it. Let it cook without disturbing it for as long as you can, pour it all over the rice and voila! You have cooked some awesome chicken curry! It's easy peasy!

This is my curry recipe with prices as accurate as I remember them.

* 2 Chicken breasts (Sainsbury's Basics are normally about £4.00-£4.50 for 4 smaller-than average
* 1 medium onion (I tend to pick up onions as and when I need them and they never exceed 20p for a loose medium onion from Sainsbury's and Morrisons)
* 1 green pepper (80p from Sainsbury's for one
* 1 whole jar of curry sauce (Morrisons and Sainsbury's both do jars of basics curry sauce for under 30p - I think Morrisons still have the 9p jars
* 1/2 tin of baked beans (I stick with basics because it's going in the curry and for 30-40p it's hard to argue with the price. The rest of the tin ends up on toast or on a jacket potato. Some among us may prefer Heinz
* 1 tin of tomatoes - choped or peeled (Sainsbury's have recently switched their chopped tomato packaging from tins to a carton. The whole peeled tomatoes were cheaper in my store
* Any desired spices and flavourings (I'm working on the assumption that people have spices in their cupboards already. I always have mild chili powder (Under 50p from Morrisons for a good amount), I love to use mint sauce in stuff now. It was about 70p for a jar at Morrisons and it gets thrown about in curries and vegetable dishes.)
* Guinness HP sauce (I'm not sure if this is still on sale

Dice and slice the chicken as desired. Heat up a bit of oil in a pot and squirt in some HP sauce as it warms up. I don't use measurements

As it's cooking chop up the onion to your liking. I like it chunky with big slices.

Just as the chicken is done, just enough to let the smells tempt your nostrils. Mix it, stir it, do what you want with it. Let the HP sauce coat everything. Chop the pepper as you please (again, I like it thick and chunky), throw that in as soon and mix once more.

Now comes the fun part. Open that jar of curry sauce and pour it in. I find that it's thick and gloopy and may take a while to vacate the jar. What I do is open the tomatoes, pour half the tin into the jar, close it, and shake it again. Then pour that into the pot. Again, stir.

At this point the heat should still be very low. Throw in any spices you want, occasionally stirring.

It takes about 10 minutes to prep everything and do the actual 'cooking' and about that time to eat a bowl with some rice. But the amount of left overs is bloody brilliant

Nothing mind blowing or extravagant

You can get pork belly at most places but the cheapest is usually the Asian market. Yesterday I bought 2lbs for $6.21. This will be enough for 6 servings. The veggies shouldn't cost more than $4


**Ingredients:** 

2lbs pork belly

1 Tbs Salt

4 cups root vegetables (carrots/potatoes/onions are the usual, or turnips depending on whats cheapest)

3 Tbs Olive oil

1 1/2 cups water

1Tbs flour

Pepper to taste

**How To**
Pre-heat your oven to it's highest temp. Take your rinsed pork and score the skin with cross hatch slits, toss the veggies in around the meat, drizzle them with the last tablespoon of oil and put back in the oven. Cook for 40 minutes. Once it's finished cooking, drain the bottom juices into a bowl, it's ok if small bits of veggie get in. Gravy: Skim a bit of the fat off the meat/veggie juice and throw in a saucepan (med/high heat) with the flour, cook until the flour turns golden brown and then slowly add the meat juice and water. Continue stirring until you like the consistency. Add pepper to taste. Enjoy!

1Tbsp Soy Sauce (or one takeaway packet)

1/4 chopped onion (I use green cause I usually stock them

Throw that delicious pig meat and the soy sauce in a pan. Cook it until you aren't going to die. Done? Excellent.

If you are lucky and have a food processor or blender chuck it in there and hold the button until you start to wonder if the bits can get any smaller. Hot damn! You just finished the filling. Drink.

Get out your wrappers and a small bowl of water. For each wrapper put a small Tbsp of the filling in in the middle. Now dip your finger in the water and smear that moistened finger (feel free to double dip) all over those wrapper edges. Fold the wet edges together in any fashion that makes you happy. Repeat until you have filled however many wrappers you want (the filling will keep in the freezer if you only want to do a few at a time.)

YEAH

Fry them: a 1/4 inch of oil in a pan

Steam them: in a steamer basket, and a lid (or a non-melty plate if you have no lid). Steam 8 minutes.

Bake: throw on a oiled pan

* **Simple Bean salad**: Kidney Beans, Corn. Olive oil, pinch of cumin. Salt and pepper to taste.
* **Veggie Chili**: Diced tomatoes, chick peas, kidney beans, black beans, onions, jalapeno, chili spice. Optional: mixed cheese (pepper jack, cheddar)
* **Lentil Soup**: Lentils, carrots, zucchini, celery, black pepper, salt, crushed red pepper.

a pinch of crushed coriander(optional)

olive oil(optional)

4 dashes of ginger

1 yellow squash

1 carrot

2 sweet peppers (or 1/2 bell pepper)

1 jalepeno

lettuce or spinach

Cut up the vegetables:

Leave in the jalepeno seeds if you want it to be super spicy

Cut the squash pretty thin.


Place them all in a skillet with the optional olive oil.  


Add a liberal amount of honey




Heat on medium high and stir occasionally to make sure the squash all cooks evenly.  It should take 

about 10 minutes for the squash to get all floppy and absorb some honey.  After

a bowl and pile on the vegetables!  If you left the seeds in

while eating.  Serve immediately.


Note: you can add chopped up chicken if you're feeling opulent!

**Step 1: Flavors**

- Heat a few tablespoons of butter or cooking oil in a medium sized pot over medium high heat, onions, fresh herbs or other aromatics/seasonings you have at your disposal. Also add a cube of chicken bouillon (SGD $1 for 6 here, and adds great flavor to a ton of dishes).
- Cook for a few minutes until flavors have incorporated well
- Things should be smelling delicious around this point

**Step 2: Rice**

* Add in several cups of rice (stir while adding
* I like to use brown ""healthy"" rice
* Cook the rice in your oil mixture for 3-4 minutes

**Step 3:Thicken** 

* While your rice is cooking, microwave or another pot to heat up (not quite to boiling point) some water. Begin gradually (about 1 cup at a time) adding the heated water to the rice mixture. 
* After each addition stir the rice until it thickens up and absorbs the majority of  the water. Depending on how much rice you added
* After the 3rd addition
* Once your rice has reached a thick, cut the heat down to low and let it simmer for a few minutes to allow any remaining liquid to cook off.

Remove from heat, or hot sauce to taste and eat alone or with any combination of meat and vegetables. Store left-overs in the refrigerator, and add 1-2 tablespoons of water during reheating. Enjoy!

minced (ground) beef 1lb

* onions 4 large
* instant gravy granuals (bisto) 
* salt and pepper to taste. 


Method cut up the potatoes into chunks about 2cm squared
and put in large heavy pot throw in the mince (don't brown the mince)
and break apart a bit so you have small clumps of beef
boil a kettle and fill the pot to just cover all the ingredients
bring to the boil and then simmer until the potatoes are soft and starting to break up. 
sprinkle in a good few tablespoons of gravy granuals and mix through

What you need

Beef: I buy mine pre chopped($3USD). If they dont have that

Onions

Green pepper/or red/yellow/blue/whatevercoloryouwant.

Cheese: Not needed

Franks hot sauce/sriracha. 

Loaf of bread

---------------------------------------------------

Directions: Toss some oil in the preheated pan. Heat it up. Toss in your meat. Cook it. Wait for it to brown. Throw in your diced onion/peppers. I pour about a half cup of water in the wok at this point

I added a bit of soy sauce at that point as well, put in sriracha/hotsauce. I load it up. 

Mix it all in. 

Now put your cheese on your loaf(cut like a subway sub), or till the breads toasty.

Voila. 

Its super easy, and very little mess.

When the meats cooking, I clean my wok. DONE! No mess.

Buy a pork loin (£6-£7 at Asda here in the UK - good quality meat). Cut it into three or four equal pieces. Each piece will give one good meal or for two if you pad out with additional veg/yorkshire pud etc.

Take one piece and freeze the rest.

Take a sharp knife and very lightly score the pork in a criss cross pattern all over - cut about a cm apart. Try not to cut into the meat, mix this and slather over Mr Porky, make sure you rub it into the cuts.

Turn oven up to max

Remove from oven and set aside. Pour off half the fat from the pan and discard. Add a chopped red onion ( i use red onions or shallots for cooking - much nicer flavour than normal ones), some bay leaves and chopped rosemary. Put the pan over  heat and fry in the oil until the onion is soft. If there's not enough fat then add a gloop of olive oil, when onion is soft add a finely chopped garlic clove, some cherry tomatoes, a teaspoon of hot paprika and cayenne pepper mixed and a wineglass of water. Scrape all the sticky bits from the pan and pour in a tin of black eyed beans (33p Asda).

Put the pork back on top and chuck back into the oven at 180 for about an hour. Remove the chillies and slice the loin into medallions

1360716767.0,18evpx,Student Just Learning to Cook - Advice for Going Abroad,unforgiven_sis,21,6,14,"Hi there!

I'm twenty years old and a sophomore in college in the US.  I just found out that I'll be spending next year living in Dublin to study at Trinity College.  While there

Dining Halls and Cafes are available on Trinity's campus but are definitely expensive and definitely outside my price range.  Plus, I'd like to stay within the $450 allowance.

So, I've had a dining hall included with my room/board where I can grab food whenever I like.  I never learned how to cook or what to cook or even how to plan meals in a budget---to be honest, Im a little excited to have the opportunity to learn all that on my own in Ireland next year.

So what I'm asking is:
1) What are some beginner tips for cooking for yourself?
2) What are some of your stand-by
3) What advice do you have for eating cheap?
4) Any other wisdom you wish to impart on me.

I will explain the stove/broiler method first

**Ingredients:**

Olive oil
Flour tortillas - I use the ones for soft tacos.  Bigger tortilla means bigger pizza
Sauce - a small jar of generic pizza sauce works fine here and cover many pizzas.  Consider pesto and other alternatives when you see them on sale.  
Cheese: mozzarella
Toppings:  these are small pizzas so a little goes a long way.  Get some good pepperoni or salami
More Toppings:  use what you've got handy.  I like to chop up a few green olives with my pepperoni

**Tools:**

Cast-iron skillet
Stove top and broiler.  
Cheese grater

I'll use the typical pepperoni pizza for my example.  Chop up the toppings, pepperoni is cheaper by the stick than in those bags of slices.)  Grate the cheese (also cheaper by the block than pre-shredded, and tastes better), slice the olives or whatever you are using from the More Toppings category.

Meanwhile, but you'll thank me when you taste the crust) and swirl.  Put in your tortilla and allow to brown on one side.  My brand of tortillas puffs up in the pan at this point - I let it expand for a few seconds (cause that's always cool), then lay the spatula over the center so that it will brown evenly.

When the tortilla smells like toast, close to the edges.  Add a thin layer of cheese - I like to just plop a circle of provolone right in the center.  Sprinkle your toppings over this and cover evenly, leaving just a thin margin at the edges.  Add a thicker layer of cheese on top (here's where I use the mozzarella and maybe some parm).  Go crazy here and ignore the whole ""margin at the edges"" thing - I deliberately scatter some past the edges of the crust, so that I get a ring of fried cheese around my pizza.

If you are working quickly

Now the broiler step: take your skillet off the stove and slide it under the broiler

When the cheese is browned, try warming the densest toppings (probably meat) before making the pizza, or letting the pizza stay in the pan for an extra minute or two before slipping it onto the plate.

Just as with a regular oven pizza, so that I get 12 two-bite slices.  (And that is why the toppings need to be cut up so small, to make the slicing easy.)  Serve with some sensible side dish that makes you feel less guilty about pizza for dinner.

What, with less oil this time because there was some left over from the first. I like pepperoni for round 1, chicken and pesto for 2.  Once you have some practice, you can make these in 10-15 minutes plus trivial clean-up.

**I only have a toaster oven:**  you will need to work in three stages.  First

**I only have a microwave:**  still possible!  Look up suggestions for how to make tortilla chips in a microwave.  I've done it, assemble your pizza, heat the toppings and melt the cheese.  You won't get browned cheese, sorry, but hey, pizza.

**What about the party trick:**  if you have a pizza stone, with careful practice.  This converts tortilla pizza for one into tasty party finger foods.  My experience is that it is easiest to toast the tortillas individually in advance, as they can be pretty fussy.  Then, close to serving time, assemble a variety of pizzas and put them into the oven, letting the cheese melt and brown as described.  Cool and slice (this is where you will definitely want 12 slices per pizza) then impress your guests.

**Note to purists:** no, but the skillet browning method is especially good for a thin crust.

All of them are worthy as being cheap in my book

**Slow Cooker BBQ Chicken**

This would have to go into that ""so easy it's not really a recipe"" category.

1 cut up chicken or just your favorite pieces

2 cups barbecue sauce or a jar of your favorite store-bought

Put the chicken in the slow cooker (Crockpot™ is actually a brand name) and cover with the barbecue sauce. Cook on low for 6-8 hours. (Newer slow cookers will probably only take 4 hours as they cook much hotter than old ones.)

**Taco Meat Pies**

You can make these up from boiled hamburger or leftover taco meat or raw meat.

Brown the meat if raw

Make your own biscuits or use a can of refrigerator biscuits.

Roll each biscuit into 1/4"" thick circles. Put a few spoonfulls of the taco meat and some shredded cheese on top. Fold each biscuit in half over the meat

Bake at 400 for 8 minutes or so. Freeze any leftovers and reheat as needed or pack frozen in a school lunch. My kids liked them at room temperature.

**Lemon Garlic Chicken Thighs**

This is one of my favorite recipes from Mama Dip's Kitchen.

6 chicken thighs

1/8 cup vegetable oil

1/4 cup lemon juice

1/2 tsp oregano

1/4 tsp black pepper

1/2 tsp garlic powder

1/2 tsp salt

1/4 cup soy sauce

Soak the chicken pieces in salted water for 20 minutes (or just rinse if you're in a hurry)

You will need (all food purchased from Target in Alabama):

* One can black beans (I got the brand name for $0.92
* One can rotel tomatoes and peppers (I like ""hot""
* One pack of small 6"" tortillas (24/$2-3)
* One egg per meal ($1.80 / dozen)
* Some cheese (I got cheddar
* Asparagus (1 lb bundle for $2.44
* One avocado per meal ($1.19 this time of year
* Bacon ($5.29 / lb
* Salt, butter, call it $0.40 per meal total

$19.51 or so gets 4 full meals with the easy ability to make several more (you will have lots of leftover eggs, and you may have enough huevos rancheros mix for 5 or 6 meals instead)

* Step 1:  Drain the beans
* Step 2: Preheat oven to 400 with a cookie sheet inside.  Take a few asparagus sticks (I use about 1/4 of the 1 lb bundle), set the foil on the cookie sheet and set a timer for 10 minutes.
* Step 3: Throw a tortilla in a toaster oven or in the actual oven for a few minutes
* Step 4: When you have 5 minutes remaining, cut open the avocado and spoon it onto your plate
* Step 5: When the timer goes off, then put the bean+rotel mixture on the tortilla, throw an egg on top of that, and sprinkle some cheese on top of that, with maybe some salt and pepper.
* Eat everything.  Try the bacon with the avocado

Individual cost: $4 if you catch some things on sale

More info can be found about the program [here](http://whole9life.com/category/whole-30/)

Lots of protein, etc, is best, though I already haven't been following that to get some more appropriately priced meats.

Tons of vegetables. Fresh is better

Clarified butter, etc. are good. No vegetable oils.

Moderate amount of fruits
Minimal nuts and seeds.
No sugars of any kind.
No dairy.
No legumes (including soy
No grains.


So, no beans...all the big, super cheap, buy in bulk items I used to eat a lot of are out.



Anyone who's done the program before on a budget and has advice

Thanks in advance for anything you can throw my way!",self,t5_2si9h,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/1erp9g/grocery_challenge_whole30_on_a_tight_budget/

------
You'll need:

- One medium sized portabella mushroom 

- A handful of baby spinach

- Some pesto (I use the kind from trader joe's)

- A small handful of mozzarella cheese (i used shredded

- A bit of olive oil

- 2 pieces of sourdough bread

Steps: 
   
1. preheat an oven to about 350°

2. arrange the spinach and  mushroom on a piece of tinfoil and cover in a light glaze of olive oil.

3. top spinach and mushroom with mozzarella cheese and fold tinfoil into a lose ball (to keep some moisture in and prevent leaking) 

4. Put tinfoil ball into oven

5. Start lightly toasting bread in toaster oven. When it's done

5. By the time you've finished with the bread (about 5-7 minutes) the stuff in the oven should be done. 

6. Cut up the now baked mushroom and arrange everything on the sandwich.

Ground turkey is usually affordable when I can get it, but because it's so cheap, it's fairly difficult to get a hold of. I was starting to consider processed proteins like hot dogs and canned chili, but my boyfriend gets terrible heartburn from these items.

I keep turning to google searches for recipes, and frankly I'm so burned out by the process that I could just cry. Or explode, whatever comes first.

Edit:  Thanks to the posters who offered advice on food. To those of you who took the stand of ""OMG I feel so sorry for you, or call me names or treat me as a worthless person. He just has expectations when it comes to food. Expectations that I would love to fulfill and am working towards fulfilling in a mature reasonable manner.
