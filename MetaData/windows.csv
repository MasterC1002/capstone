1356797065.0,15mljp,Tired of defending Windows 8,kingofplanetfap,467,127,348,"I am a long time Windows user, nothing could go wrong, I was greeted by the heavily criticized Start Menu. I went to desktop mode to check if all drivers survived the upgrade process and they all did. No driver-problems at all. I noticed that this OS felt smoother and faster than 7. It took me about an hour to figure out all the new stuff and after I had gotten used to everything

I am starting to believe that I'm one of the few people around who actually have had this experience. There is so much criticism on this OS, but are riding along on the 'Fuck Windows 8 and it's lack of a start button'-train. The people who have tried it, hate it because there are some changes they can't or just don't want to get used to, for example the location of the 'shutdown/restart' menu. I know some people have difficulties with changes in general, but really, it isn't that hard to learn. Yes, I agree you shouldn't change a winning team, the bad reviews are endless and the anti-windows 8 circlejerk is gathering more members every day. 

So I am getting tired of defending the OS and actually convincing people to give it a try. I sincerely believe this OS has a future, but I wanted to share my thoughts with you. And for those who are doubting to upgrade..give it a try. You might like it..

1345604692.0,ym8rz,µTorrent has lost its way,orrd,233,26,138,"Note: I originally posted this to the µTorrent forum

µTorrent originally became the most popular torrent app for one simple reason... it was a small, web search (might as well put a whole web browser inside the app while you're at it), add-ons, media playing, media conversions... etc etc.  Users rejected all that garbage and chose µTorrent specifically because it was the one torrent app that gave users exactly what they wanted.  A simple, small application that does one thing well and doesn't try to be anything it's not.   We already have web browsers, media players, and virus protection.  We don't want a torrent download utility that thinks it's an operating system.

Somewhere along the way, but the current developers honestly probably are genuinely unaware of why that tagline was appealing to users.  I really, honestly think they don't know.  I think they really believe users want a torrent app that does everything imaginable.  They probably think it was a fluke that uTorrent become so popular without being loaded down with all those ""useful"" features that surely users must want.

More than that, and paid bloatware garbage applications that it tried to push at me.  The screens were even designed in such a way to fool novice computer users into choosing to install the junkware by using misleading text and dialog boxes that seemed to imply it was necessary or advantageous to install the junkware programs.  

I've had it.  I'm done.  I'm actually angry at this piece of software at this point.  And I'm not the only one.  Users are going to start dumping µTorrent in droves.  We've seen it happen to countless other programs that went from popular to hated because of this very thing (anyone remember RealPlayer? or WinAmp?).  

But some companies will never learn.  So they repeat the same mistakes

I really think it's probably too late to save µTorrent at this point.  Once you lose the faith of your users,False,self,t5_2qh3k,False,,,t3_ym8rz

_____________________________________________________________________________






I am a 21 year old ICT student

I've used Windows 95, Vista and 7. I've also used Ubuntu (started at 10.04), linux mint, Backtrack 5, chromium os, and some more i don't remember. Now it's Windows 8's turn. **As a matter of fact i'm typing this in windows 8**.

I have to admit
I got to the Metro UI (wich isn't even called metro anymore) and i thought it was looking great! Simple

A lot of people complain about how terrible IE is. Yes it is (the metro version). But if you are somewhat a regular pc user

The default music player? It looked nice at first

I hear many people complaining about metro, how there is no global search option (wich there is). This is how i use the start menu: press the windows button ( i practically never use the start button in windows 7 so i didn't even had to adapt), type the first two or three letters of the app you want to open et voila. It will open on the desktop, wich looks just like windows 7.

In my opinion windows 8 is faster and visually more appealing than any other OS i've used before.
I tested a few games a month ago. I have a Dell Studio 1737 laptop wich isn't really a game laptop

In windows 7 it annoyed me that i coulnd't scroll smoothly. I don't know how to explain it in English but it didn't go smooth at all because my driver did not support it. Windows 8's default driver made scrolling much more pleasant!

When i bought my laptop i ordered a bigger battery. A 9 cell battery instead of 6 cells. But even with a bigger battery my longest uptime without recharging is 2.5-3 hours in win7 and 3.5 or even 4.5 hours in win8

Windows 8 has been my primairy OS for almost two months now (dual boot with windows 7) and i have to say, but once you found it, you'll wonder why you haven't found it earlier.


Now, but i don't get how you could hate the **entire** OS.
 

 
 

Everytime i read a review everthing *sucks* in their opinion. Not even 
&gt;""i did not like this but hey, man"" 

but more like 
&gt;""This SUCKS and you should NEVER EVER buy windows 8!!!""

And now i really feel like the only man in the world who actually likes windows 8 and would recommend it to friends!

After accusing the second one of being a scammer he promptly hung up on me. I then immediately called Microsoft support who would then confirm my suspicion of it being a phishing scam. They said that they are aware of it and that it is being investigated.

They will say that there has been some sort hacking attempt directed towards one of your computers

[A separate review of most of these software packages is available here.](http://www.infoworld.com/d/microsoft-windows/9-windows-start-menus-windows-8-208963?page=0

* Regain a unified search function instead of Win8's broken search.  There are a number of different free and commercial Windows Search Replacements, [StartIsBack... $3](http://www.startisback.com/#features), [Start8...$5](http://www.stardock.com/products/start8/), [ViStart](http://lee-soft.com/vistart/), and [StartW8...

* Kill Hot corners: The hot corners can be disabled by [these registry hacks](http://www.instantfundas.com/2012/08/disable-start-screen-and-hot-corners-in.html), [Retro UI... $5](http://retroui.com/), [Classic Shell... free](http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/).

* Metro Apps opened inside civilized windows instead of full screen: Two tools can do this: [Retro UI... $5](http://retroui.com/)

* Keep the Taskbar visible even when the Start Screen and ""modern UI"" apps are open: So far the only tool I know to do this is [Retro UI... $5](http://retroui.com/).

-----
**Minor Bypasses

* A lot of the behaviors of the taskbar in both Windows 7 &amp; 8 can be controlled with [7+ Taskbar Tweaker](http://rammichael.com/7-taskbar-tweaker) including, thumbnail-previews, left, right, scroll-wheel, and middle click actions.

* Launch ""Modern UI"" apps from the desktop:  [Detailed Instructions](http://itswindows.com/tips-windows-8-launch-metro-apps-desktop/).

* To collect the many setting of Win8 into one place one can make a [GodMode folder for Win8.](http://tweaks.com/windows/61231/activate-windows-8-god-mode/)

* Disable the ribbon version of Explorer on Win8.  [Ribbon Disabler for Windows 8 ](http://winaero.com/download.php?view.18).  You can also set up the drives as the default view instead of libraries [with this hack](http://tweaks.com/windows/63907/launch-file-explorer-with-drive-list/).  Although frankly there are 3rd party file managers out there more powerful than either version of explorer; I suggest [A43... free](http://www.a43filemanager.us/).

* Get the old task-manager and briefcase back.  The people at WinAero have provided us with [Instructions and appropriate tools to do just that](http://winaero.com/blog/how-to-restore-the-good-old-task-manager-in-windows-8/).  Although frankly there are 3rd party task managers out there more powerful than either version of task manager; I suggest [Process Explorer](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-ca/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx).  

* The windows briefcase can be [re-enabled via a registry tweak](http://winaero.com/blog/how-to-restore-the-missing-briefcase-feature-in-windows-8-rtm/).

* Turn off SmartScreen filter for installing 3rd-party applications using [This Hack](http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-turn-off-smartscreen-filter-for-windows-8/).

* Get rid of the lock-screen: [Step by step instructions](http://www.windows7hacker.com/index.php/2012/07/how-to-disable-and-bypass-windows-8-lock-screen/).  If you want to keep the lock screen and log on with a pin

* Get desktop gadgets back:  I never had any use for them

* Windows Games such as Minesweaper, and are metro-apps](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/windows-8-version-of-minesweeper-includes-themes-adventure-mode/) rather than desktop applications.  If you want the [old desktop versions they can be copied from an old computer onto a Win8 as described here](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/replace-terrible-windows-7-games-classic-xp/).

* Get back DVD movie support.  Windows used to have this functionality natively.  Now we need a 3rd party app.  A good one that is free is [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/).  Similarly

* [XPmode that works in Win 8](http://lifehacker.com/5965889/how-to-run-windows-xp-for-free-in-windows-8?utm_campaign=socialflow_lifehacker_facebook&amp;utm_source=lifehacker_facebook&amp;utm_medium=socialflow).

* [IE in metro mode now supports flash on all websites, it stands to reason, that the existing blacklist for IE10 could also be bypassed in this manner.

* Microsoft has made a number of Metro apps the default applications for opening many media files.  So double clicking on a file can invoke metro apps even if you are in the desktop and avoiding metro implicitly.  Since even the best metro apps are generally dramatically less powerful, however this is very slow and tedious.  It is however possible to uninstall all of the default metro apps for a user or all users all at once [using a command in powershell as described here](http://techdows.com/2013/02/remove-windows-8-default-apps.html).  Also, Microsoft has [unwittingly given us a way to prevent Metro apps from running at all by requiring that User Account Control be enabled in the registry for them to run](http://www.gamespot.com/forums/topic/29309528/windows-8-disable-uac-and-keep-metro-apps-functioning).  There are security issues with disabling UAC, but doing so is another way to kill all metro apps in one step, but it's probably better to uninstall them using the powershell command.  [A wide variety of free replacement desktop apps can then be downloaded and installed in batch via Ninite](https://ninite.com/).

**Appearance and theme alterations to Win8**

* Disable transparency of Windows 8 Task Bar:  [Start8...$5](http://www.stardock.com/products/start8/) has an option to do this.  [Classic Shell

* If you want the transparent window border with blur effect from the days of Aero-Glass in Windows7

* It used to be that an interface to adjust window-border padding existed.  That interface has been removed but the setting that it controlled can still be accessed [as described here](http://tweaks.com/windows/62971/adjust-window-border-padding/).

* The 'Advanced Appearance' dialog to control most windows appearance settings like text size, etc has been removed in Win8, [however the old Advanced Apearances settings still exist in the registry as they did in Win7, and can be altered directly from the registry](http://www.askvg.com/how-to-access-advanced-appearance-settings-option-to-change-text-size-in-windows-8/).  There is still [a gui for changing text size](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPOrtG-Kjds), but colors require the registry.  The color of windows and taskbar can be set with [Aero8Tuner](http://winaero.com/comment.php?comment.news.95).

* Windows compresses images that are set to the desktop background.  This has been so on all recent windows versions, particularly vector art images looking very poor.  Fortunately, this ""feature"" can be bypassed [as described here.](http://www.neowin.net/forum/topic/1115331-wallpaper-quality/page-2?p=595278309#entry595278309)

* Out of the box, a lot of small visual effects in the Start Screen can be added or controlled.  You can customize the appearance of the start screen in many ways with [Decor8... $5](http://www.stardock.com/products/decor8/index.asp).

* MS has set it up such that themes can only be loaded that are digitally signed from MS itself, which is intrinsically dangerous.  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!  Once system files are patched, you can install 3rd party themes.  You will be able to find loads at [DeviantArt.com](http://browse.deviantart.com/).  One theme of note is this [reconstruction of the Windows Classic Theme for Win8](http://kizo2703.deviantart.com/art/Windows-classic-theme-for-Windows-8-RTM-325642288).

**Customizations to Windows 8 that don't attempt to change the Windows 8 paradigm**

* User Account Control (UAC) can be disabled by either a registry hack or by running as an administrator and [selecting ""Never Notify Me"" in the control-panel interface](http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/5509-user-account-control-uac-change-settings-windows-8-a.html)  If you want to disable UAC in Win8 AND be able to run Metro-Apps

* Create Custom Refresh Point In Windows 8 [With Recimg Tool](http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/create-custom-refresh-point-in-windows-8-with-recimg-tool/).

* A lot of customizations can be made with [Windows 8 Manager](http://www.yamicsoft.com/windows8manager/index.html).

* Windows 8 natively doesn't let you pin just anything to the start page... only apps.  Fortunately

* You can change the number of app tile rows in the Windows 8 start screen [with this hack.](http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/increase-number-of-app-tile-rows-in-windows-8-start-menu/)

* You can make custom tiles for the start menu with [OblyTile](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1899865).

* The Win+X menu can also be customized with [this tool from WinAero](http://winaero.com/download.php?view.21).

**The new set of APIs** apparently seems to be directed to Metro Apps who interact a lot with webservices and such and let you create or install certificates specifically for the packets downloaded with restriction permissions.

I am not an expert. However, so I have some experience with Windows 8. I am typing this on a mediocre 4-year-old laptop running Windows 8 Release Preview, so if I am not sure about some OS feature, I can quickly check it.

Why am I doing this? I'm just bored. Also annoyed at all the Windows 8 misinformation.

Here are a few points to start with. Feel free to pipe in with your questions and comments.

~

Q) Which version should I buy?

A) If you want to buy and install Windows

If you have a license for XP, 2013, so get that. After that date, Win 8 will probably be cheaper than Win 8 Pro. [See the differences between Win 8 and Win 8 Pro here](http://windowsteamblog.com/windows/b/bloggingwindows/archive/2012/04/16/announcing-the-windows-8-editions.aspx) and decide for yourself which one suits you best.

There is another consumer version of the OS: Windows RT (note that it is Windows RT, Windows RT is your only choice.

~

Q) Do I get Office free with Windows 8?

A) Windows RT will come with Word, you know, continue to use whatever Office you already have. All applications that run on Windows 7 will also run on Windows 8 and Windows 8 Pro.

~

Q) How do I turn off Metro?

A) You can't. You can

Also

~

Q) How do I boot straight to the desktop?

A) You can't boot straight to the desktop. You can resume from sleep straight to the desktop.

~

Q) How do I get the Start button and Start menu back?

A) You can't. Or maybe you can if Stardock builds a program for it. The Metro Start screen is an effective replacement for the Windows 7 Start menu. In Windows 7

* With keyboard - tap the Windows logo key

* With mouse - click the bottom-left corner of the screen

* With mouse - hover the pointer at the bottom-right of the screen for a second

* With mouse - Swipe from the top-right of the screen to the bottom-right

* On a tablet - tap the Windows logo key.

* On a touch device - swipe inward from the right edge

Lots of choices there

~

Q) Can I use Windows 8 with keyboard and mouse

A) Yes. Additionally

~

Q) Is Windows 8 just Windows 7 with Metro slapped on?

A) No

~

Q) Can I run Windows 7 programs on Windows 8?

A) Anything you can run on Windows 7


~

Q) Can I install programs without going through the Store?

A) You can install Metro apps only from the Store. Enterprise versions of the OS allow Metro apps to be installed from outside the Store under certain conditions. You can install Desktop (traditional,False,self,t5_2qh3k,False,,,t3_wd9pq

I was really wondering WTF was going o because I was seeing these temps while just looking at the desktop with nothing major running.

I discovered that it was Windows 8's ""Video"" app. I'd watch a video and then go back to desktop apps doing whatever. The video would be done/paused and that's the way of things since Windows 8 doesn't really encourage closing your full screen apps.

Closing Video showed an immediate drop in GPU temp and it went right back to 40C. I did this several times with the same results each time. Other full screen Windows 8 apps can cause a smaller leap in idle temperature.

* Win+X will bring up a quick launch style window in place of the traditional start bar.
* Win+A brings up the apps (aka - start) quickly. 
* Win+E brings up explorer (like before) 
* Win+R brings up run
* Win+T brings up the tabs for the current running process
* Win+I brings up the settings pane (right side) 
* Win+P brings up projector settings
* Win+D brings up desktop
* Win+F brings up files/search
* Win+H brings up Share
* Win+K brings up devices
* Win+L locks the box
* Win+M minimizes all windows (dektop)
* Win+TAB brings up the sidebar view of all running apps (cycle through)
* Win+#  brings up the process running in that space (same as 7)
* Win+W brings up settings
* Win+C brings up the quick sidebar (the name escapes me at the moment)
* Ctrl+shift+esc brings up the new Task Manager
* Alt+tab cycles through apps horz.

---
Grab an app and slap it to the side of the screen to keep it in view (handy w/ mail + desktop view). You can also force a left/right snap by right clicking the app once it's up on the side view

Using the facebook app built in has no ads (for those who aren't using firefox+adblock already :) )

Hyper-V is built in - go spin up all your favorite VM's and play around (Do try out Server). Native wireless support is now baked in (yay!)

Rainmeter works like a champ and is a really easy way to customize your desktop area. We still have the gadgets also

On the first day, even coming from a school system where computer education was mandatory.  The teacher was equally as shocked and while taking roll, stopped midway through and said ""could I get a show of hands of people who were sent here for typing classes?"" and almost every hand in the room went up.  ""Ok, if you have your hand raised, please go to your guidance counselor right now and explain to them that this is not a typing class.""  Afterwards, there was something like 7 of us.

Fast forward a couple of months, having a computer in the house was still considered somewhat special.)  I was offered a job with the school, maintaining the systems and answering questions for anyone that came by, which was primarily  the school district's secretarial staff, who would come in to learn how to use Word and ... well, Word.

And here we come to the point of all of this ... The first couple of weeks of doing this, and then when they would miss because the cursor would move just a tiny bit when they brought the mouse down, they would just line it up and do it again.  After I showed them how to use a mouse, the problem promptly stopped.

These were women in their 50's, but rather [something more along these lines](http://files.encuentra24.com/20/31/2031720_867cef.jpg).  The learning curve for them was straight up and down, and they adjusted very quickly once they were shown by a 16 year old kid how to click a mouse.  And when they asked how to use the most basic functions in Word, they started to learn on their own.

My point that I'm trying to get at here is that so many people are making such a big deal out of how different that Windows 8 is when compared to 7 (in practice

**Edit/Epilogue:** When Windows 95 came out, they just went straight to work.  There was no dicking around on Yahoo (what's this Internet thing?) or loading up 50 toolbars.  They just went straight to work.

It was a completely different ecosystem with a totally new Interface.  Nothing at all looked like the Windows that I had taught them to use

Here's the thing that I found really amusing.  Care to guess who was that the person that had the most trouble adjusting to Windows 95 and complained about how the new interface was going to be a complete failure?

It might help some of us in the future. So please don't fall for this or let your loved ones fall for it.

I'm sure this has happened to many of you. But I thought I would share my experience. 

This morning I'm working away on issues like always when one of the admins calls me. 

""This is Derpa

""Oh

I take the call and it is a guy with a very heavy accent. 


They guy lets me know he is from ""Mircosoft call center"". Oh ya. Not ""the"" Microsoft call center


He continues to tell me that my computer is seeing a report that there is something wrong with it. I ask him which computer. We have over 100 computers in the building not to mention all the servers. So I ask him if the report to him included a computer name or Ip address. Looks like the report to him only include the information ""Windows 7""


Well if he is so sure I had better let him troubleshoot this for me. So I proceed to let him troubleshoot it. At which point he gets really excited and says


""You see the c t r l key on your keyboard?"" he asks.


""Yes I see the control key on the keyboard."" I reply


""Yes the ctrl key."" he asks again.


I let him know again I know the key.


Finally he gets that I know which key it is. He then continues


""Yep


""Type I N F and press enter.""


""Got it I have the INF folder up.""


He asks me how many files there are


I then start to see if he will play. I ask him again how he got my info and what my name was. He was good enough to know my first name from the Admin Assistant that transferred the call to me. But doesn't know my last name. 

Under his breath he then says


I then ask him where he worked. Which again is just ""call center"". I then asked him for some random made up Microsoft reseller partner number. 


Hey then asks me if I am IT. I say yes. His response is classic


I love my job sometimes.


For those really interested here is a copy of the audio from the call.

I've never really gone looking for such a feature, so I don't know what to expect.  What about some sort of utility similar to Carbon Copy Cloner?

* I've actually enjoyed later versions of Safari, that would be great.  How terrible is the Windows version of Safari, and should I just move to Chrome or Firefox?

* Anything else I should know?

Some advice would be great -- I'm going to miss some things about Apple.  I really, however I'm just ""meh"" about OSX since 10.7, and I don't like feeling like a filthy hipster whenever I take it somewhere in public.  Overall, I don't like Apple enough to go out of my way to buy and keep a second computer around just for that purpose.

Well doing this breaks Windows Defender's autoupdate functionality as it depends on two things:

1. Automatic Updates are on
2. That Auto updates have the default settings

(Now before you bug me about using Defender, and I am behind a pfSense firewall which scans ALL traffic and sends it via local proxy to an AV scanner before the traffic even reaches me. All malicious traffic is blocked by Snort.)

So with some Google-fu

It shows you how to set up Defender to check for updates through the  Task Scheduler. Someone was even nice enough to leave a comment at the bottom of the page to show you how to do it through the cmd prompt.

So hey, here ya go.

Having said that. I am making an honest attempt at liking windows 8. The OS does have a lot of features I find useful. But also a lot of things that leave me scratching my head. 

I can deal with the new start screen as its not too dissimilar to other quick launch interfaces that came before it in OSX and Linux. It would be nice to have the option to have a button instead of a magic invisible corner button. But I guess that would be too much to ask.

The first issue I have is with dual monitors. The fact that every time I mouse between the monitors I hit either the charm or the application sidebars for a split second is really annoying There should be a way to set the 4 corners and avoid the space in the middle. 

The second Issue I ran into tonight was when I was trying out the music app.  I got it all configured picked a band and started listening to music. It was great.  I click on my 2nd monitor to go back to the desktop to work on my homework. BAM

The third issue is pretty much the same as the 2nd. I was watching a movie with netflix and decided that I wanted to look something up on the googles. I click the windows button ont he keyboard to bring up the start menu on the other monitor and BAM netflix disappears. It's almost as if microsoft forgot that computers are capable of multi-tasking.

I see so many people praising Windows 8 and pretty much dismissing anyone who does not like it as crabby pants who dont want to upgrade. So I gave it a shot. It feels horribly incomplete and not very fluid for the desktop user. 

I promised myself 2 weeks to adjust. But so far if some of these issues are not fixed. I think I will be rolling back to Windows 7. ",self,t5_2qh3k,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/windows/comments/13zn3j/a_few_big_problems_with_windows_8_so_far/

 The first issue I had with it was all the adapters I needed to buy to get the basic port functionally I needed. I knew the fact going in that it could not support 2 external non Thunderbolt displays but not having basic ports such as HDMI and only 2 USB ports really is not ideal for me

The second issue I had was with the cooling and the heat output of this machine. Any amount of stress put on the CPU will cause temps to hover at or above 70-80C. The same goes for the GPU, it heats up your legs and your desk. Since the entire thing conducts heat, your hands start to get hot..  My 11 inch W110ER handles the heat output much better than a 15 inch Macbook Pro. 

 Speaking of heat output and power, throw in the screen, the wireless cards audio, SSD/HD, it just doesn’t make sense. Apple stated that if you exceed the power output of the adapter it will start the draw from the battery. Well that sucks if you are in a pinch or enjoying BF3. Battlefield 3 is the only game I noticed that forces the Macbook to draw from battery most, other games draw a lot less. Last thing, my particular computer had nasty backlight bleed at the bottom on the screen

With the amount of security holes it has, during the 90s it was a good practice to install Java because the sites running Java applets were much more common.  You would install the system, get the drivers, download Java and so on.  But these days things have changed, Java is rarely used on websites anymore and has almost been completely replaced by Flash.  Actually, aside from Minecraft, I can't think of it being used on anything popular anymore.  I have probably come across only a couple of (non-essential) sites that required it in 5 years.  It also happens to be **one of the most popular** ways drive-by malware gets installed onto systems

a.	It is better safe than sorry. Copy them onto a flash drive or external to ensure their safety.

2.	Update the Windows OS
a.	Do so until it says no more updates.  
i.	Windows 7 has the option of installing multiple language packs. Only install the ones you actually need. You can hide all the rest.

3.	Update Programs
a.	This includes Firefox, and any other programs you use frequently.  
b.	You should also upgrade your software if you are able to.  Do some research on your older software and determine if you can better use a new version or not.
c.	Updating/upgrading your antivirus is also important and is discussed at the end.

4.	Remove Programs
a.	If you have programs preinstalled such as bloatware or applications you no longer use nor need

5.	Install ccleaner (piriform.com)
a.	Once installed
b.	Clean the registry.
c.	Under tools you can select to uninstall programs and to disable startup programs
i.	Uninstall any programs you haven’t already done.
ii.	Disable startup programs that you know you do not need so do your own research. Keep the startups that look for updates active of course.

6.	Install Defraggler (piriform.com)
a.	I personally consider this better than the built-in defragging option.  It also gives you a better interface.  Install and run till completion.

7.	Install/update/upgrade Antivirus
a.	If you do not have any I personally suggest Microsoft Essentials (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx) since it does a good job

8.	Run a full antivirus scan
a.	If it finds something allow it to remove the virus.  Depending on your antivirus it may ask or might do it automatically. 

After these steps you should have a faster system.  Make sure to update and clean regularly. The amount of time these steps take can range depending on many factors including the age

EDIT: I really should had added 'speeding up' in the title as well :/ 

EDIT2: Changed 'defragger' to 'defraggler'

1311390456.0,ixdoo,I was the guy trying Windows for the first time in 7 years. It's been fun but switching back. Reasons inside.,windowsexplorer,43,17,24,"First

To recap: I've been using Mac OS X and then Linux for the past 7 years. Hadn't touched Windows since XP way back when. I am one of those few people who doesn't even encounter Windows at work so I legitimately had 0 contact with it for the better part of a decade. I decided to install 7 on my laptop and asked /r/windows for advice.

It's been been pretty much a month. I've been using Windows 7 exclusively at home (my corporate laptop doesn't have Windows on it so only at home.) I've been writing code in it

Here's a list (in no particular order) of the main reasons I am switching back:

1. Lack of an official software repo. I dread downloading programs on Windows. The process of going out on the web and looking for an app from a download source that wont leave me stuck with malware is just too stressful. I miss just installing whatever I want whenever I want without thinking about ""is this safe?"" ""is this genuine?"" The result was I stuck to open source software I already knew from Linux. Things like Firefox, etc. So I was using the same software as I was on Linux, it was just harder to install.

2. Lack of multiple desktops. This one is just such a killer for me. I've found the process of managing windows on Windows a complete pain. I have all this stuff piled up on top of each other. Finding what I want when I want it is a mess. I love to have different desktops with different tasks on them and use spacial memory to navigate them. I just remember things like ""terminal is to the left"" and ""firefox is to the right."" Once you get that way of navigating ingrained in you nothing else works. And an add-on program doesn't work - you need multiple desktops integrated tightly into your desktop environment and window manager.

3. Crapware and disorganization. It seems like every app I download wants to - by default - install all kinds of rubbish. Task bars, it is arbitrarily named folders decided by the developer.

4. Command line. BASH is awesome. As a developer I found myself feeling like I was Batman missing his utility belt. The Windows command line is way too basic. PowerShell seems more full featured but I didn't want to put in the time to learn a whole new shell for the sake of an experiment. I tried CygWin but is was slow and not quite what I wanted. I use GNU tools constantly. I can't live without sed, grep, and friends.

5. The little things: I can't stand Windows' font rendering / ClearType. It's like the anti-aliasing is only on to the slightest degree. On high resolution displays Windows fonts look light

6. Lack of freely available high quality software. Anything full featured on Windows costs - and usually costs a lot. It's like the Ferengi designed it. On Linux I am used to having access to tons of great software for my hobbies. Music production software, all sorts of stuff I'm in to. I was able to get some of it for Windows (GIMP, Xchat) but most of it isn't available and the Windows equivalents cost big time. I am all for paying for software but hundreds of dollars for software in this day and age? Nope. And piriting is out of the question for me. I have a strict policy of never taking another person's work against their terms. If someone makes a program that costs too much I use an alternative; I don't take that person's work against their terms.

There are things I'll miss about Windows though. Here's a few:

1. The Windows 7 - not sure what you call it - ""bar at the bottom that is like a dock on steroids."" Definitely the best combination app launcher / manager thing I've used on any platform. I've come close to it on KDE but Windows 7's is great.

2. Firefox for Windows is fast, fast. Mozilla puts a lot more into Firefox for Windows as compared to Linux and it shows. I was shocked at how buttery smooth Firefox on Windows is. I will miss that.

3. Netflix. :( Back to only having it on my PS3 (and now my 3DS woot!)

4. Steam :( I &lt;3 Audiosurf

5. Windows is pretty consistently fast. It wakes from sleep fast. It connects to wifi fast (though the connect to wifi UI is not nearly as well designed as Mac or GNOME.) Windows pop up fast. Everything is pretty snappy. There are some Linux distros and DEs that are as fast as Windows on my hardware but none of the really pretty ones. KDE looks as pretty as windows but suffers fairly constant stutters. 

Well


EDIT: Forgot something I liked and will miss. I think their called ""Libraries?"" It's essentially just symlinks but they way they are managed and presented in the GUI is really cool. I could emulate the same functionality on Linux but I couldn't get the same level of integration with the UI and apps with it.

1362852697.0,19zaai,Mac-like Four Finger Swipe in Windows 8 Tutorial,TroyDL,33,10,12,"After a good deal of research and effort I have enabled 4 finger desktop swipe on my Samsung NP700Z7C-S03 laptop. This allows me to swipe left or right and jump to a different workspace. I figured this might be a good place to post this because I went down the hackintosh road too and there's a good chance some of you may be interested.

First off there are requirements. I have only tested this with my pc so I can't guarantee it for other laptops or even other versions of windows on this laptop. But I'm guessing as long as you have Windows 8 (maybe 7) and an Elan (elantech) touchpad with at least 4 finger multitouch

First requirement: an Elan touchpad with at least 4 finger swipe. You can either check online to find out

Next requirement: Dexpot 1.6.6

Third requirement: Windows 8. There is a very good chance 7 will work fine but this is the one I know works. To be specific
Alright

1. Install Dexpot
2. Load registry editor and go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Elantech/SmartPad. Make a backup of your registry settings just in case. Make a backup of your whole OS if possible. Do not change anything except what I specify. Be aware that modifying your registry could make windows unusable so backup and be careful if you're new at that. (Probably not a problem for this subreddit)
3. Open your Elantech specific touchpad settings UI and set it aside.
4. Open the Dexpot settings and go to controls on the left.
5. Change the following key settings to the following values if not there already: FourFingerMove_Enable=0x00000001 FourFingerMove_Enable_Mode=0x00000000 FourFingerMoveLeft_Enable=0x00000001 FourFingerMoveLeft_Func=0x00000004 FourFingerMoveRight_Enable=0x00000001 FourFingerMoveRight_Func=0x00000003
6. Go to your mouse settings window you've opened and make a small change
7. Go back into Dexpot's settings/controls section and open the ""Switch desktop"" list. Click on ""Next desktop"". Check ""Allow hotkeys without modifiers"" and uncheck any modifiers. Then click in the textbox underneath the modifiers. Perform a 4 finger swipe left or right (depending on how you want it to function
8. Click apply and try it out.

If Keycode 167 or 166 did not show up then either your drivers or hardware doesn't support it

I'm really hoping this works for other people. I've searched high and low for something like this and failed to find anything, let me know what didn't work and if I can think of anything to help I will.

Also it's not quite as fluid as OSX


Cross-post from Hackintosh.


**edit:**
You can also enable a mac-like app expose to show all current workspaces and applications on each

Set FourFingerMoveUp_Enable to 1 and FourFingerMoveUp_Func to 9 (which is pageup). Then go into the dexpot settings under controls/dexpot components and set the ""Window catalog (all desktops)"" to shift and then perform the swipe in the input box. Remember to change a setting in the mouse settings gui quick to make windows recognize the registry change.

You can set this to whatever your comfortable with

Better yet
