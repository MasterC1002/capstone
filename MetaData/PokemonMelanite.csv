I added a fog effect to dusk forest. A fog effect is an image that covers a map and floats over. They are clouds very similar to the ones in the forest in DPPT. 

I am working on using similar methods to add rays of light shining whenever you exit a building/enter the overworld during the day. 

The game is fully playable through the 1st gym! I have done bug fixes and re played through multiple times. There is anywhere from 1-2 hours of gameplay in this depending on if you skip through talks, etc. I also finished Route 3, which is north of Lily Town.

I got a LOT of ideas from you and a lot of questions and I don't want to respond to 20+ comments. Here are my responses to some commonly mentioned things.

* Poison animation and sound and stat lowering animation and sound are the same. **Read the bottom of this post**
* Bubble text box for NPC's talking has a line between the arrow and the box. **That will be EXTREMELY time consuming and difficult to fix
* Music looping issues. **Working on it. I'm going to try to do something with an intro and then the main part loops
* Spelling/Grammar **I have fixed everything that was brought up
* Lens Flare looks Awesome! **Thanks I thought it was a nice touch.**
* Why is Sneasel mad at you? **When you talk to your pokemon they will sometimes have items
* Some text is hard to read because of the color (mainly on options screen) and any text that is red is really hard to read **I have changed all red text and anything unreadable to either white or a nice pinkish color that is REALLY easy to read on any of the text box options.**
* Reflections in water are messed up **I know. There is no real way to fix this without completely reworking that script. You're going to have to live with it
* Fog
* Animated battlers look amazing/look too pixelated. **Some people said both of these. They are the sprites from BW/BW2 and they are supposed to be pixelated. Thank you if you thought they looked cool.**
* WILL THIS GAME BE PLAYABLE ON MAC??? **With Wine yes.**
* Arrow keys are messed up on the controls screen. **I fixed it.**
* Menu. **I am now going to add labels to the menu so you know what is selected if you can't tell by the image. Thanks for all the comments saying you liked it**
* Poisoned effect while walking around is off. **The screen doesn't flicker when you have a poisoned pokemon in your party. Instead it blinks red. Poison fades away with 1 HP left like in 4th gen
* I love how the items in the field appear as what they are. **Thank you. I thought it would be cool.**
* EXP bar filling noise is missing. **THANK YOU. I need to do something about that.**
* Menu sound levels are too high. **I personally thought they were ok. I'm going to keep them unless this gets a lot of comments saying I should lower them.**
* Forest entrance/exit tiles look weird. **I am still looking for good tiles for that. The shadow is a place holder.**


Now

* Fix the text bubbles if I can.
* Fix menu a bit to make it easier to understand
* Add as many attack animations as I can. This is my main goal at the moment right now. Especially status effect things that will come up a lot.

*A great guy named ScreenHunter is helping fix the menu system a bit to make the pokedex better.

So, as long as I like it too, and it fits. The gym is water type. I am not going to make many restrictions, but if the idea is too silly, don't expect it to be in the game.

* Added Attack Animations for all status effects and about 150 moves. The game now has all the animations that have been made for Pokemon Essentials. As more are made I will add them.
* Finished Mapping Vetus Town and Mapped Route 4
* Fixed a HUGE gamebreaking bug on Route 3 which I hadn't been able to figure out for months
* Attempted to fix text bubbles but failed... Sorry guys they are going to stay how they are.
* Palm Trees are Headbuttable now :D
* When a repel runs out you are asked if you want to use another one. (You're welcome XD)


Two more maps until the second gym! Progress is being made. In case anyone is wondering...

Route 4 is a beachside route that zigzags a bit back onto normal land and up into the start of the mountains. It connects with Vetus Town and leads into Route 5.

Route 5 is in the Mountain Range that comes around Origin Mountain. It connects with Route 4 and leads into Split Soul Town


One more thing. I am considering dropping the PokeDev and just using a normal PokeGear. I'm having issues and I honestly don't think it's worth it.

**1. THE STARTERS**
They are Croagunk, with Natu not being able to effect Sneasel with its psychic attacks. This is meant to add a level of difficulty to the game if Natu is picked. I am sorry if you personally don't like one of the starters, you can pick a different one if you don't want it.

**2. NO THE GAME IS NOT RELEASED**
The game is still in development. I hope to have a demo sometime in Spring with 3 gyms. There will be beta testing. It has not started. The game will be completely free to download.

**3. FAKEMON**
As of now fakemon are NOT in the game. There is a small possibility that there will be a few fakemon

**4. THIS IS NOT A HACK**
No

**5. THE POKEDEX**
The Zela Region Pokedex contains 285 pokemon. 8 of these are legendary. There will be a 100 pokemon expansion post elite 4 which will include over 20 more legendaries. The Hoenn and Kanto starters will be obtainable

**6. EVOLUTIONS**
Many Pokemon will have changed evolutions. There won't be any traded evolutions to keep it so every Pokemon can evolve. There will be different methods. Some will become level up, I am not telling.

I restarted my project, I was more organized, and didn't start the game making right away. However, just after restarting, my computer crashed. Everything I had was lost, and I started school again. I thought the project would remain dead, until about a month ago, when I decided to continue it.

There was a strange Pokemon he had never seen before ahead of him. He reached for a Pokeball and the battle began. The boy captured the legendary Pokemon Darkrai, and woke up. A few days later though, Darkrai escaped the Pokeball, to the region of Zela.

There, he found the way blocked. Before Darkrai could do anything, three young trainers, Alice, Yang, and Yin, along with their mentor battled and defeated Darkrai, in the basement of Shroud Pillar. The world was safe.

You are a young boy/girl who has lived in Lily Town all your life. It is a good life, but on your way you run into a strange old man. The man is talking to himself, and bumps into you. He studies you for a strange amount of time, and asks for your name. He jumps, but soon hides his excitement, apologizes for bothering you, and heads toward the forest. You follow him. Dusk Forest is a dangerous place, and you follow the man in. After walking a short while

When you wake up, as Prof. Oak doesn't have time to bring you back to town, and you can't go out by yourself. After thinking for a moment, he decides to give you a Pokemon to use to protect yourself. You walk over to a table where he places three Pokeballs. The Pokemon inside pop out, to show Croagunk, Sneasel, and Natu. You pick one

Long story short, when you get back, the professor is gone. There is a box with a letter, telling you to take the items inside and go to Novum town, and find a trainer named Alice. You take the Pokedex and Pokeballs inside, and begin your journey.

I spent just about the entire day today (8 hours) eventing. This is the process of creating events that make up the game. Anything you interact with or that interacts with you needs to be made. And, and tested, and tested. From those 8 hours I spent, about 15 minutes of gameplay was made, depending on if you stop and read everything. I am very happy with this.

More good news. Pokemon WILL follow you. I just finished reimplementing this feature and by some miracle it worked perfectly the first time. I have decided not to post the results directly from the survey. I will give you an overview though. I received over 300 votes

The Fakemon: The results were close, I don't want to here any more about it. Fakemon will NOT be in the game.

The starters and mascot: Will stay the same. The vast majority voted for this.

Getting a Pokemon to rival your rival: This was really close all around. I am still unsure as to what I will do with this.

1: Allow players to get more than one of a particular TM (unless Ray's going with the Black/White aspect of TM's)

2: Re-battle leaders with different type match ups (which would make the game more interesting if you decided to beat it with a Pokemon with a type advantage)

3: Make leveling slightly less difficult.


But then this poses the problem that you could just beat all the gym leaders once more before fighting the Elite 4 and get more exp than you could have in a normal Pokemon game.

My solution? Ray **could**, Normal being when you can re-battle, Hard when you cannot.)

Just a thought.

So, planned it, and soon escapes Lucas. Darkrai is mad at the world for being so bright and cheery. He has never fit in, and never will. People are scared of him, and rightly so. Dakrai plans his revenge on the world. He escapes Sinnoh west to the Zela Region. There, he tries to discover the Orbs of Order and Chaos, and destroy their balance. Luckily, along with her mentor Prof. Oak

Until now, but I will say it again. This game includes things and people from many Pokemon Movies and TV Shows. This is one instance. 

The two other trainers are Lucas and Paul. Paul is just like he was in the Anime. Cruel, who eventually changed him. The two became great friends, and Paul becomes friendlier towards Pokemon. So, once Darkrai escapes Lucas, he and Paul visit Prof. Oak. Oak is wise and realizes that Dakrai is up to something, and goes with Lucas and Paul to Zela. There, they meet Alice, and Pokemon come from the orbs of Order and Chaos


Now, telling that you are the only one who can stop Dakrai when he comes again.

First off though

First off, and natu, not only to be different, but also because they are some of my personal favorites, and because they set a difficulty level to the game. Many of you have heard this before, but I will say it again for those who haven't. Croagunk would be setting an easy difficulty, the first two gyms are weak against you, but nothing extraordinary. Now, but because you can't touch your rival. I made it like that for a reason.

Now, I hate it so it shouldn't be put in the game"" For those who don't know, I am changing the way many things work. The starters will have improved stats, learn better attacks, and all evolve around the high 20s. For those who just have a personal dislike for a pokemon, suck it up, you can pick a different starter.

There has been a lot of talk lately about Fakemon. So far, with no fakemon. I will however wait for more people, and then see, and if there is an overwhelming majority of people who want fakemon, I will make something work.

**Red/Leaf:** Red's existing team

**Ethan/Lyra:** Feraligatr, Shiny Gyarados, Togetic and Sudowoodo

This is the easiest one as it shares many parallel's with Red's team. Three starters

**Brendan/May:** Swampert, Castform, Metagross and Wynaut/Absol

This one was more tricky. The player recieves a Beldum and Castform, as it's rare and popular, but, as far as I know, there aren't any more 'story' Pokémon.

**Lucas/Dawn:** Infernape, Riolu/Lucario, Togekiss, Porygon-Z

This one has Pokémon obtained in the story, but apart from that, they fit pretty well.

**Hilbert/Hilda:** Samurott, Zoroark/Zorua, Darmanitan (with Zen Mode) and Volcarona/Larvesta

All of these are obtained via the story

**Nate/Rosa:** Samurott, Sawsbuck/Deerling, Crustle and Shiny Haxorus

Each time you use a move, and Flamethrower/Ember/Water Gun will increase Special Attack, and Tackle/Bite increases Physical Attack. Defensive moves, besides giving a temporary boost, will also increase your base Defense stat after the battle. Same with Special Defense moves, and so on. Defense can also increase by the sort of attack you receive, but I'm sure that would end up making the perfect Pokemon harder. Natures can affect how easily it is to EV train a specific area, a Pokemon with Mild nature will increase the EVs gained in Special Attack by 1.5, but still lets you create the perfect Pokemon


TMs can help you train your Pokemon in EVs by giving them the moves necessary. Some moves are more effective at EV training then others. For example, because how it also has the effect of decreasing Special Attack. However, basiclly, the more powerful the move, the more EVs gained.
The Max EV count would probably have to increase from 500 so

I just stumbled upon the thread on /r/pokemon and was excited about the game the second I saw it. I checked the subreddit, which weren't answered in the FAQ, so let me get started here.

1) It's said the game is downloadable as an .exe file and playable without any emulator. I don't own a functional Windows PC, wether the finished project will be playable on Mac also ?

2) Will it be possible to complete the national Pokedex, will there be any kind of reward upon finishing it ? Maybe a starter to be chosen from any other Pokemon game ? Would be very awesome.

I also have a request

And last but not least, if it is possible to release it multilingual, it would be no problem for me to play it in english, but my little brother and some of his friends are huge pokemon fans as well, but aren't able to speak english that well, to be able and play the game in english.

I am really looking forward to the game (or a beta).

Sincerely
