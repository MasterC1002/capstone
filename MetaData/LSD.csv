I dipped my fingers in the wave as I contiuned to surf along, and it exploded with color and beauty where I had put my hands. Great experience.

My friend and I began our come-up by watching Planet Earth and listening to The Lion King soundtrack. Within 20 minutes, and it felt like we were actually there with the penguins. Within 40 minutes, we were nearing our peak and decided to throw on Clint Mansell’s The Fountain soundtrack which ended up being a profound auditory and visual journey.

By the one hour mark, asking myself “Who are you? Where are you? How did you get here?” The thought of ‘me’ did not exist, nor did the thought of my friend exist. We began talking about everything and anything, but our voices seemed cosmically connected and echoed throughout the room. Since I was peering upwards and could not view his physical self, it felt as though our thoughts were being tossed around the room at a million miles an hour. At this point the visuals were absolutely fascinating and almost indescribable. The popcorn on my ceiling began to create gorgeous patterns that shifted in a quicksand fashion, and the longer I peered into one spot the more detailed the patterns became. At one point a saw the entire alphabet littered across my ceiling in orange, red, purple

Perhaps the most amazing visual spectacle came at about an 1:30 into our journey. As I laid there on my bed echoing universal thoughts to my friend, I asked myself “How significant are you?” and BOOM! I saw the universe unfold before my eyes in a cascading fashion. First I saw myself, then my house, then my city, then my country, then the earth, then our solar system, and then our universe, I matter. I matter because I influence the world around me on a day to day basis. The vibrations I send collide with all the other vibrations that surround me and there must be a balance of positive and negative energy within our world. I never truly understood the the concept of the Buddhist idea of Yin and Yang

Around the 2 hour mark, and we started laughing our asses off for no reason whatsoever and ended up lying down on the floor. Amongst our laughter, I started to observe my cat very closely. She seemed to realize that we were on an elevated plane, and I noticed that she was listening to the music with us. I watched her ears shift in attention to all the vibrations of my bass as it echoed throughout the house. At one point at the end of a song, there was a strenuous hissing noise and she acted accordingly my running around the room in a frantic manner, but as soon as the music calmed down, she followed suit. I remember witnessing this on another trip before, and I couldn’t help but hysterically agree.

While laying in this room, nearly two decades later, tripping together and having an absolutely incredible time. It felt like we were young children again, enjoying everything that life had to offer. We discussed that maybe this is why we do drugs, to reclaim the joy and wonder of childhood. We discussed how unfathomable it is for our government to persecute individuals for willingly altering their state of consciousness. We discussed how much propaganda and false notions surround psychedelics. We discussed everything from religion to politics to science to music for the next hour.

About 3 hours in, I would completely forget what the topic at hand even was. Visuals started to pick up, and I felt like I was floating so I decided to dive into the realm of closed eye visuals and lose touch with my body completely. Under closed eyes, I remember looking at an obscure planet from a space eye view as it was being color shaded with these beautiful pastel colors. Surrounding the planet were stars that glowed very bright colors and were surrounded by wavy patterns, akin to an atom molecule. These stars weren't stars, however, but instead seemed to be small faces that greeted me with joyous smiles, things began to ""erase"" and once it was gone there was a pyramid in its stead. Atop this pyramid I was looking at a being that resembled myself. For the remainder of my blastoff

As I awoke from my closed eye journey, and then retreated back to my room with my friend. The remainder of this trip was filled to the brim with phenomenal music, great discussions, beautiful visuals, delectable fruits and smoothies, and a short walk around the neighborhood as a refresher. About the 10 hour mark, we decided to open up a few Pyramid Hefeweizens and enjoy the last couple hours of our trip. On that note, my friend and I decided it was time to slumber.

Another ten minutes pass and I was fully enveloped in psychadelic space.  For a moment I was terrified that I overdid it (to be honest, and I could barely see in front of me.  But I realized there was nothing to do now and so I'd better hold on.  At that point most of my friends dosed with half of what I did (or less), and all reported a really quick and intense come up similar to mine.

We walked over towards the man for the fire and the sky was pulsing, towards the man.  When the man burned I laughed and cried and hugged all my friends who were in the same place as me, and what followed was the most spiritual and emotional and euphoric 24 hours of my life.  I didn't sleep, I just explored, danced, met people and talked.  I also went to the temple and meditated and prayed and discovered parts of myself I didn't know existed.  For the first acid trip in my life, didn't smoke a single cigarette.

I saw a new painting by Alex Grey, and we felt for the night that magic truly existed everywhere around us.

When the sun came up it was like I was starting a new life.  I went back to camp and met up with some more friends, and I still do.

I don't know how much acid I took, but at Burning Man I held on to my sanity and explored myself and others in a beautiful way.

And honestly

So here

**LSD**
 - The trip should start within 45 minutes, LSD is a scentless/tasteless chemical, meaning - if your blotters taste bitter, spicey, spunky or anything other than like paper:

A. It's not LSD

B. There's something else in conjunction with the LSD on the blotter causing the bitter taste such as weird ink (not as common as you hope).

Some chemical compounds that are commonly sold as LSD are as follows: 

**2c-x**; these compounds are phenethylamines - related to mescaline 2c-x's are usually in a white crystalline powder. The dose of these substances range from 10 to 50 mg. Not usually in blotter form as the doses are so big

**25-x-NBOMe**: These are derivatives of the 2c-x class, and don't seem as safe as it's older relatives to the 2c-xs. The dose range of NBOMe's are anywhere from 500 micrograms to 2 mg on one piece of blotter. 

**DOx**: DOx compounds such as DOI, and are considered psychedelic amphetamines. These are many times sold on blotters, and effects can last up to 36 hours depending on dose. These tabs will also leave a bitter taste in one's mouth.

Bottom line here
NBOMe's come up within 30 minutes
DOx's come up usually within 1:30 to 3:00 hours
2c-x's usually hit within 45 minutes to 1.5 hours

There seems to be a lot of RC hate on here; which is unfortunate, proceed with caution. There are more chemicals that can fit on blotters that are not on this list, such as some psychedelic tryptamines. But the only reason that someone would sell a chemical on a blotter as LSD is for money, so don't expect so see super rare chems on blotter, because half the time those would cost more to make than what they're being sold as.

I know the LSD game is a hard one

All of this is assuming you do not have access to a test kit - if you do

&gt;
LSD TIPS for Noobs

&gt;-Store LSD in a cool

&gt;-Don't mix with antidepressants or antipsychotics(if you're on these

&gt;-Some people like to fast beforehand to prevent any excessive digestive issues. Some people get a sore stomach

&gt;-Do not consume any beverage containing chlorine a short time before
-If you are new to LSD only try one tab of any batch the first time you do it. You can occasionally be surprised at the strength

&gt;-If you trip alone or with others

&gt;-LSD trips are often journeys into your own consciousness

&gt;-Sometimes a trip is just really fun

&gt;-If you can trip with someone experienced your first time, that they could never fathom. You also read into what people are saying a little too much sometimes and paranoia can set in. Last, but not least, some straight folks think it's funny to do stupid shit like wave their arms in your face and mutter shit to make you think you're going balls-deep.

&gt;-If you find you are going into a paranoia attack, whichever is less crazy, and turn off the music.

&gt;-Some of the worst trips start on the comeup, and if it's a big enough dose you fear you're dying. Don't worry, you won't die, practice breathing slowly... count to ten while breathing in slowly, then breath out slowly and count to 10. This part is not too long usually, and then you can move around and really enjoy what's around you.

&gt;-If you're going to do any other drugs

&gt;-For a full list of cautions

&gt;-HAVE FUN!

There was about a year to a year and a half run that I did acid every week, excerpts from the many nights I traveled down the rabbit hole. 

I've always been able to handle myself well
The walls are turning in on themselves, their eyes drifting apart, their smile curling on the ends. I feel the carpet beneath me and stroke my fingers across it, feeling so soft, vibrating under me, i feel almost as if I'm on ecstasy.
Clicking through stumble upon
I get lost in the luminescent rainbows hanging like a beautiful chandelier from each laser beam dancing on the wall. I grab Kirby and we crawl under the fort/tent we set up ahead of time and start running our hands and feet along the fabric above us.  Laying on our backs we've set sail letting the suspended sheet engulf us fully, confused about what could of caused it. 
Suddenly, fully fluffed, staring at us, scared after trying to attack the sheet and causing the catastrophe. 

I've always felt that when tripping
Psily would pull him self along the carpet with his claws

After a while tho, dubstep up, the warm sun and cool spring wind on our skin, driving where ever the music takes us. It's getting late, and we're not quiet ready to let our trip go yet... We take the short drive to my friends, and before we know it, I'm watching Lanclose as he takes it straight to the dome. He's on the ground, holding his eye open as devin stands above him

Flash forward. We're at the beach, the seaweed scaring the shit out of us as it wraps around our ankles. The stars shimmering. Alex and I wonder off. What else to do on the beach but build a sandcastle. We lived out a whole life there. Named Starbucks. We had teskimo (Texas Eskimos) to work the gates and property, of our resort style castle. I've never had such an emotional connection to a pile of sand in my life. 

But for all the good and fun, why not? And three days later, I did about 3 blots. Everything was fine. A more mild trip than usual, but I felt okay... Until after my peak. I always want more. So, whats a few more hits? Worst idea ever. I quit tripping. Nothing moved nothing was swirling. All the sudden I'm in a prison cell, my brains being smashed to pieces and blended. I sat there, for 3 hours clutching mmy head, swearing I'd never do it again. 

And then I sobered up. Waited a couple weeks and got ready to drop again. The life of a druggy... Just cause we got into a little rough patch... I love that crazy girl. 


Ill add that Now I haven't done acid in about 8 months.... And I'm seriously itching to do more.... Sadly all I can find is random drugs being sold as acid. :/

What I wanted to know was how many people working in the various fields of science have had any experience with LSD and other psychedelics. I've heard stories about scientific discoveries inspired by acid trips and its certainly something I can see being true. Some specific questions:

* Have you ever taken a psychedelic? If so

* Was your interest in science perhaps sparked or fueled by your psychedelic experience? Have psychedelics given you a different perspective on your field of science?

* Was it a positive experience in your life

As I grew older, after a drawn out marriage and a lot of counseling, my parents got divorced and now live completely separate lives, which has made things much better.  I also went through the process of losing my faith in christianity and becoming an athiest (which I now am).  

Losing my faith and my parents marriage gave me a very cynical attitude toward marriage and the idea of monogamy, and never have to ""deal with"" raising kids.  

This all continued on until I took some LSD with a few friends at my house.  The trip came on, good conversation, etc.....  On the comedown (my favorite part) I was sitting with my friend talking about life (he was not tripping).  He was talking about college and his major in economics and how he didn't want kids right away and maybe never because of the financial strain that it would put on him.  He said that he would have a much better time without kids and more money to spend on himself.  

After he said this, and I saw my father living his whole entire life without kids, buying things for himself, living for himself.  Then I thought about the fact that my father DIDN'T do that, and because of this, I was sitting on the couch experiencing the universe at that EXACT moment.  This realization hit me so hard, that I was simply a result of my fathers decision to have children, without any kids, and how the universe has GIVEN us this opportunity.  What kind of person is given the opportunity to reproduce, the financial strain

This led me into a long conversation with my friend about kids, what greater thing is there in life?""

I now have a deeper appreciation for the idea of parenting and raising kids than I have never had before.  Just thought this was a cool story of one of the many psychological ""gems"" that you can receive from LSD.

Freedom from self isn't getting away from the person in your head that you don't really like, light, spontaneous, uninhibited and capable person who's up for anything.  And yet, psychedelics can introduce you to the core of your being that fits that description perfectly--maybe for the first time, surprising you entirely. 

In more practical terms, cut back your dose.  It might not seem like such a roller-coaster ride, but you stand a better chance of bringing about a lasting transformation of your perspective, and a lasting sense of empowerment.

This guide will be a sort of how to on how to deal  with the experience on a personal and psychological level. 

**When and where to take acid**

I personally wont trip with people  who aren't also tripping. I might low dose at a party - just enough to get  giggly and see some colour shifts and breathing walls

A trip sitter can be handy (thanks AnagramsOnly)

It doesn't hurt to have a couple of valium in your pocket

**When it starts to kick**

So you've taken some acid and whenever you blink you're seeing shapes and colours. Now is the time to feel excited. You're about to take a journey. Some journeys are bright

The key is not to get scared. Everything around you is a TV show to be observed and enjoyed. Nothing can hurt you. If things take a dark turn

If the experience is enjoyable (99% of them will be) then soak it in. Remember that it is your mind creating these images and you have ultimate control over what you see should you choose to embrace it. Stare into the night sky. Watch the colours dance. Focus your energy on increasing the intensity. Make a conscious decision to like what you see and power it up. Focus is key. Dancing lights in the sky can become intricate and beautiful fireworks with a little will power.

If it is not enjoyable

Never be in a situation where you feel like it's not ok to talk about what you're seeing

**Shit's getting intense**

No matter where you turn or what you do

Immerse yourself. You are on a spectral plane. You are a shaman visiting a different realm. 99% of people will never be on the plane of experience you are on, because it will unfortunately come to an end.

**I'm coming down**

After a long time of tripping balls your mind and body are exhausted. you want to rest and need to sleep

**The afterglow**

You're fully lucid again. Walls may still be breathing

**The coming days and weeks**

If you tripped hard enough you probably feel no desire to do it again for a while. You feel you've gained all you can from the trip and may assume you never need to do it again. As the days and weeks pass

Go back to step one. Find a safe place in good company and enjoy the ride.

**Non-visual effects

Everything written so far is applicable to non-visual sensations

* Looping - Often you'll find yourself repeating the same thought over and over again. It could be a sentence, an emotion or a hallucination. This can be frustrating and sometimes scary - other times it can be quite enjoyable. Like everything else, it is within your control. To fix looping, try doing something else. If you're walking around in nature, try going inside and putting on some music. If you're sitting inside listening to music, try going for a walk outside. Change your physical behavior and your mental state should follow. Sometimes it just means you've been alone with your thoughts for too long without any new stimulation. Try talking to someone or watching some TV.

* Disorientation - Again, but it's cool. You can deal with it. If you find yourself disoriented, stop, take a deep breath and take a slow look around. Collect yourself for a moment instead of panicking. It's super unlikely that you're actually trapped or lost, you just need a second to get yourself together. It's best to trip somewhere safe, familiar and friendly.

* Lack of focus - While tripping, just tell them that you're having trouble focusing. They'll be cool with it. Remember, they're high too and they're probably feeling the same effect to some degree. They'll get it. Never be afraid to tell anyone around you what's going on in your head. On that note, don't trip with anyone you wouldn't feel comfortable expressing yourself to.

* Freaking out - This is rare, most of the time you'll see that it hasn't been that long. Try and get yourself excited about how much more time you have with this amazing experience.

* Needing to be alone - I get like this sometimes. For a lot of people, turn on the TV. It gives you a nice, low intensity focus point while you gather yourself together.",,False,,t5_2qhvj,,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/1gkd5x/i_wrote_a_beginners_guide_to_enjoying_a_trip_good/

since then ( over the course of 11 months ) my life has improved drastically. my confidence has grown immensely. i can talk to people and joke around, and am proud of myself. goodbye depression and anxiety, you will be forgotten and may you never resurface.

She was like

I dont know

We have pretty much gone from having sex once every 2 weeks to fucking every day. And it has been great. 

I just thought I should mention this. If things are getting a bit stale. Take acid /mdma with your partner and fuck her like an animal. It is truly amazing. 

I never thought LSD would be used for sexual issues, we cant keep our hands off each other.

B knows where to buy acid

B had some yesterday and he assured us it was good stuff, and head to a party that B was talking about earlier. We all take our hits as we drive to the party. We had a ways to go, so by the time we arrived, the acid began to do its thing. Just the little stuff though. 

Things became more apparent and ""real"" if you will. I kinda had that invincible feeling with an intense focus on everything. Its like my brain was beginning to fully function for once. I have pretty bad add but acid pretty much threw that out the window for the time being.
 
A, but I had a lot of fun just going around and fearlessly socializing. I felt fucking great. Not quite tripping out yet, but just feeling super duper.

And then things got a little more ""trippy"", what we use it for, the concept of time, etc. Then this dude stumbles over and asks if I'm on shrooms and I said ""No man, acid!"" And he was just like ""Fuck yeah man!!"" and high fives me and walks away.

More stuff happens, and sit in the passenger seat because she is trying to talk to me. She explains that she has work the next morning and she has to get up really early, but wants me to leave and sleep over at her house. I'm trying to tell her that I am starting to trip, that wouldn't be a good idea because I would be trapped in her room at her house and sleeping on acid just doesn't happen. Plus we would have to get up extra early so she could drop me off at home that morning. Not very cool. But she doesn't care. Her hormones are all out of whack and reasoning with her is just impossible. She even starts crying a little bit. What the hell, are you really going to do this to me right now??? As she's going on and on, I start to REALLY feel it. Things outside are getting wiggly and ""breathing"". Whenever I tried to repond to her, my choice of words are pretty strange and doesn't really seem to be on the same page as me.

 Then her dashboard caught my attention. Beautiful, but after I explain myself, she thinks it's pretty funny and I finally convince her that it would be a bad idea to take me home. '

She finally leaves and stops trying to argue with me. Now I am REALLY there. It took like forty minutes to get her to just leave me and the party is pretty much over. The host, another dude and some chick are all standing around the fire out back. I had my acoustic bass there but I couldn't find it so I go in to find it with A. Turns out the host's dad had it somewhere because he saw it and didn't want some drunk jack ass to mess it up and tells us that he too is a musician. A and I have been playing together and in various bands since early high school and we just talking to him about guitars and music and such. He eventually invites us to see his guitar room and check out his collection. Little did we know about what we were about to get ourselves into.

All over the walls there were guitars and basses, PRSs were the primary choice of this collector. Not to mention the Pearl drum set in the corner and all the amps there too. He gives us the ok to play and we have at it. 

A is my best friend and we fit remarkably well for each other when it comes to jamming. We have been playing and writing music with each other for a very long time. He shreds on guitar and I hold it down on the bass. I have to say

So we are sitting there just jamming out and the host and his dad are pretty blown away by what we are playing. It was all complete improv

 Host's dad was very impressed and he offered to smoke us out with some FRESH WEED FROM HIS GROW ROOM. We smoked and things just got insane. The trip at this point was definitely at its peak and host's dad got behind those drums and we pretty much rocked out until 4 am. Afterwards he gave us a couple of beers (I don't know if he knew we were tripping our balls off the whole entire time) and we eventually left to come down from it all at A's house. We don't even know where B went but he returned the next day hahaha. 

We couldn't really sleep due to heavy closed eye visuals

It was fucking awesome. Doing all of that on acid was just a dream come true for me. It was such a beautiful experience.",,t5_2qhvj,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/12szlz/i_had_a_pretty_fantastic_time_dropping_acid_for/

The apartment is situated on a hill and there are a billion slippery steps to get to the beach. It was really hilarious trying to climb down the steps...I held onto the railings for dear life and walked a step at time feeling like I was climbing a mountain. I don't know how we managed it, twirling and falling in the sand, awakened and truly alive. Our souls were melting into the brilliant sea. 

We decided to go back to the apartment and had a few moments of panic as we realized the turnstiles were not responding to our key card...we were locked in, and not a drop to drink! We got into survival mode instantly. Count our resources, divide the rations, devise a survival plan. haha. I felt like I was ship-wrecked and loved how my brain kicked into action mode so quickly. We wouldn't see a single soul for another 12 hours! That's when the life guard would get in. 12 hours on LSD feels like an eternity! I observed how incredibly at peace I was at the thought of being stuck on the beach. I felt open to the adventure and willing to see the bright side! If I wasn't on LSD, I'd probably be focused on how uncomfortably wet, cold, sandy and thirsty I felt.

We found a way to escape the beach and almost got lost but found our way back to our apartment and got clean and comfy again...spent time talking, it was teasingly looking in at me, a familiar eye, I think of it as the all-seeing eye or my own consciousness staring back at me...and I wanted to melt into it, just get lost in it forever, but my friends wouldn't let me sink in...they kept engaging me in conversation or doing fun stuff that distracted me from it...which I thoroughly enjoyed too...I really really wanted to go to that place though, be inside that shiny eye...it's a place where I lose my ego and strip myself from all my pain...it's a place where no one can hurt me...it doesn't bother me that I'm imperfect or that I haven't achieved everything I wanted to achieve...it doesn't bother me that there's violence on our planet and suffering...it's a place where I can just let it be and completely understand that it has to be that way. I usually strip myself apart when I go there and then put myself back together when I come back to earth, dancing, this thing...it chases me...teases me...begs me to come inside...it gives me an adrenaline rush...I feel nervous because it's unfamiliar and familiar all at once...I don't know if anyone else experiences this...it's like an unknown dimension that I seem to get a peek into. It's beautiful there. When I sink into it, people from history

The sun races us! 

Day was breaking and we were trying to get dressed for the beach and get to it on time to watch the sun rise...we felt like we were racing the sun trying to see who gets to the beach first! We actually managed to make it. We were happy to find that some strangers had molded a beach bed in the sand

We stood in the water thinking that the ocean is a ""she"", joy, pain, love, life, feeesh, so much feeeesh, beauty, she will comfort us too. We were enveloped in joy and energized by the 4 elements, the wind at our backs cooling us down and dancing on our skin

When people started arriving at the beach, beautiful and I felt love, peace and serenity with everything in our universe...

Here's some pics of our adventure land: http://imgur.com/a/T2w0s#0 *edit* - added a few more pics since people seem to really dig the place...thought I'd show you more of the apartment and a few more beach pics. 

TL;DR; Had a frikkin' amazing LSD trip on the beach, teased me with ideas about mysterious things of our universe, and brought a huge smile on my face that sun couldn't outshine!",,False,,t5_2qhvj,,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/1ka3zf/in_an_ocean_of_lsd/

First I want to talk about my first time tripping.  A few weekends ago I decided to try it with two close friends.. we took two hits each.  Turns out they were mic'd at 200-250 μg each... so that was 400-500μg my first time.  One of the more scary / strange psychological experiences I've ever had.  At first it was pretty cool... I was nervously excited about the whole thing.  I was really liking the music, how textures on the most plain objects and things popped out, it was like I was seeing the world in an entirely different mode of thought (which I was).

And then my friend put on some of the darkest dubstep I'd ever heard.  The acid kicked in too, how to move my legs, how to text; I simply lost feeling.  It was insane.  I then dissolved out of the room and started hallucinating: I saw what I perceived to be the end of the universe (which turned out to be a pile of my drunk friend's vomit; this did not help at all)... I kept on popping in and out, attempting to use ""mind traps"" to control my ""mind loops"" and ""time-travel"" so I didn't have to experience the end of the universe again.  I wanted to tell my girlfriend so bad yet I didn't know what to say and I was depressed to think I might never see her again.

Everything was kaleidoscoping... I saw the universe as a collection of all possible decisions I could ever make, creativity, that I could run away across the country and it wouldn't matter since the universe was coming to an end in a trash can. Some parts were AMAZING amongst this mess.. I heard some music like I never had before, I felt it course throughout me and run through my senses like a stampede of wild animals.  The stimuli of a bunch of drunk people bothering me, trying to comfort me and my hallucinations, however, did not help at all: I kept on losing myself in and out of the trip until I accepted the end of the universe, accepted the depressing circumstances I was in as perpetual and inevitable


**After** weeks of pondering this first trip

But then I suggested when my girlfriend of 2 years came to visit me this weekend (we hadn't seen each other in 2 months; 3000 miles apart) that we candy flip because maybe with her things would be different.  And I wanted to try candy flipping.  She had never done anything besides drink and smoke weed (neither had I until many weekends before).  She was down though

We took 250 μg at 9:30pm, and intimate as fuck because we hadn't seen each other in so long.

I'll say right now that this past weekend has changed our relationship, except this time we were listening to mellower music instead of dubstep (m83, Cut Copy, Passion Pit, Temper Trap, Phoenix... even Lady Gaga). We were lying on my bed naked together, hooking up, and we started feeling strange; that strange sense that your mind is slowly expanding

And **just like that, but something else entirely.  We had tripped and fell into each other.  This persisted for two hours... we were each other, and I don't really remember anything besides the feeling of being enveloped inside of the love of my life.  Though I was confused as hell, it was the most comforting, serene feeling I've ever felt.  And she experienced the exact same thing.  Unexplainable.  Perfect.  The music was intense and immense during this period; [Kim and Jessie by m83](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9yvItZAjfY) played and I felt completely encased in the music; the lyrics were perfect and I felt like everything was perfect and always would be.

We came out of this trance around 1:00am (maybe.. time wasn't making sense) and we were confused and unsettled; not used to being separate physical entities again, and Us (and did the rest of the day)... they were practically interchangeable.  We were talking (most likely blabber to most people, as we were both confused about what we were experiencing), trying to figure out us, the drug, what we were doing.. and we understood each other like we never have before.  I was finishing her acid thoughts, and she mine.  It was surreal.  We talked until we sort of stopped feeling major effects at about 9:00am.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/g5o0i/i_didnt_know_one_weekend_could_change_everything/

About a month ago, this was the best possible place to trip. My friends parents who owned the house are extremely conservative (they have pictures of the george bush family all over their refrigerator) yet they have a large collection of artifacts and art from around the world. My friend who lives there is a very successful naval officer who works on Oil tankers in the Indian Ocean. He didn't take any because he's in the navy, he just enjoys drinking and watching us trip. He told us to feel free to look around the house and touch and examine what ever you want. I wonder down to the basement as i begin to feel the effects kick in. Downstairs one of my friends and i discover this huge wall covered with all sorts of old books. We're talking about National Geographic books dating back to 1918 up to 1975. I am speechless! We read these for a good while and then discover a really old Encyclopedia Britannica (we couldn't find a date in it, but we could tell it was old because there were some characters we were not familiar with.) Now I'm a huge music fanatic and I like to research why humans find music so interesting and how music makes us feel emotion ect, so I flip to the page that discusses music. (It spelled if Musick in this book btw) I can not begin to tell you how much information it provided. On one of the pages, it described music as geometry. By this time the acid had kick in to its full effects. My friend and I were amazed by the way it explained it as geometry and were baffled by the diagrams it provided, but we didn't understand it. My friend told me the best way to understand was to go grab a bunch of printer paper and markers and spread out all over the ping pong table. After a while of writing things out, we had made a pretty big mess but were still a pretty confused. The rest of my friends came down stairs and were amazed at the mess and information we had printed. They asked us why and at the same time my partner in research exclaimed

3) Re-fill pot with the same amount of water, allow to steep and cool for 20 minutes.

4) Drink the second batch all at once as well.   The first batch should be just kicking in now.  

The next half hour will be very powerful, bringing you up to a higher level.  Altogether, it will quite likely be a stronger, somewhat briefer experience than you're accustomed to from mushrooms.  Choose your dose accordingly, if you typically prefer 1/8 oz, go with 2g instead, if you typically prefer 2g, using a quarter ounce.  Turns out no-one else wanted more than a small cup so I wound up drinking half the pot.  Oh, so to speak. ",t5_2qhvj

When I dropped 3 tabs of high grade acid, spaghetti seemed to pulsate and slither around on it's own on my plate.  I'll keep the trip report short, since you most likely have heard many similar stories.  I felt my mind being torn apart.  I asked my boyfriend (i'm gay) at the time if it would be okay to let go, if I would return to normal.  I detected hesitancy when he answered ""Yes."", but as the trip progressed, I really didn't have a choice in the matter.  I tripped for a total of 12 hours or at least, I went to sleep towards the end of it.

Afterwards, how memories were stored, how sounds were processed.  I didn't have a continuous memory until a month later, and I progressed through what I call ""abstraction layers"" until I reached the top where I was before and kept going.  

The best way I can describe it is the difference between doing all the sub processes without having to actively think about it and doing all of them manually.  It's like doing something new like long division.  At first, and the answer is as easy as reading the question.  Once I don't have to think of sub processes, then I consider myself to have gone up an abstraction layer.  Throughout all of that time, and it took me a little while to really realize it in that state, I had emotions.  My theory is that I had to reconstruct my mind because a new variable of my psyche was introduced.  Now, I can choose to feel or not to, at least to the extent I did before.

I'm interested to see if anyone else had a similar experience where LSD changed the way they think.  How would you describe it?  Does my story sound similar to others you may have read?

I had  been hiding my voice changing the way it sounds for 5 years. I am a woman


Over the past few years the voice I was using became very habitual, and remembered everything that night. 


I also remembered, I sounded so natural, the voice sounded like me. The voice stuck with me for 24 hours. And I was so happy to have my voice back after these 5 years of hiding it and thinking the bitch whistle I was using was my real voice.


Fast forward to now and that voice went away. And I'm not sure why. My voice was beautiful


I want my voice back, it is sitting normally. But my voice still went back to mid range. And a vocal range of a pygmy squirrel, when before on lsd it was of a sperm whale and I was genuinely happy because for the first time I felt like me.


Can someone help? I think I may have acid reflux these past few years if that helps solve anything but I'm not sure why that would change on LSD or cause it to revert itself.

We drove two hours to get to the park


We parked our car in the MASSIVE parking lot and began to prepare ourselves for entrance into the park.  We knew that we were going to have to stand in lines for awhile waiting for roller coasters, a yo-yo, and a few other goodies.  


We enter the park about an hour after dosing, and Shpongle is sounding REALLY good on my iPod.  Visuals are starting to really pop.  We get to the front of the line, and adrenaline starts flowing.  Then, the employee running the coaster says something along the lines of: ""Oh, i'm sorry, you can't get on the coaster with your backpacks, you'll need to go rent a locker and get back in line.""  We all froze.  I think it took about 10 seconds before I said anything, and we decided to head back to the car to unload.  


After an hour inside the park, drop off our backpacks, and decide to hang out at the car for a bit.  I opened all the doors in my car, and start blasting some music by String Cheese Incident.  We all started dancing in the parking lot.  After awhile, we realized that we had been at the car for another hour, so we mustered up the courage to go inside the park.  This time, we were going to try the water park section.  We had our swim suits on


We decide to go to the kiddie play area, water jets shooting out of the ground, etc.  After about 5 minutes of laughing and splashing around, I realize that the mixture of chlorine and body sweat really isn't too pleasing, at all.  We all agree to go back to the car.  


Back at the car again, and my buddy surprises us with a Tupperware full of watermelon chunks.  This REALLY hit the spot, as fruit always does.  We ate fruit, drank some gatorade, danced to more jam bands outside of my car, and decided that we NEEDED to get on a roller coaster.  We each ate a dip of some MDMA powder I had in my car, then we changed into dry clothes, determined to get on a roller coaster.


We get inside and giggled as we walked past giant costumed employees dressed like Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck.  We headed straight for the 'Raging Bull' roller coaster, which were very abundant.  I pulled leaves off of the bushes that bordered the lines, and marveled at mother nature.  


About 90 minutes after getting in line, a gust of wind sends the aroma of fresh vomit in our direction.  We all exchange very concerned glances.  I felt like I was going to throw up, and so did they.  Luckily, my buddy had a tin of Vick's Vapo-Rub in his pocket, and we all scrambled to rub some of that under our noses.  This definitely saved the day.  


At long last, the ride begins, and we start climbing up the steep incline to the top of the Raging Bull.  The ride went CLICK CLICK CLICK as we slowly climbed higher and higher.  The view was magnificent, we could see for miles, the people on the ground looked like ants, looking down on the trees from above was amazing.  It felt like we had been ascending for about an hour before we reached the top.  Then, it was go-time.  It was INSANE!  We dropped hundreds of feet at what felt like a near vertical drop.  There were trees whizzing past our heads.  I pulled my sweaty, corkscrews, and we each just said ""Wow.""  The experience was unbelievable


We decided, doing our usual routine of smoking, dancing, and eating fruit.  It's starting to get dark, and we knew we had to get inside for maybe a few more rides.  


The lines were still excruciatingly long, too, was a phenomenal experience.  At one point during a loop, my sunglasses flew off my face and time stopped.  I grabbed for them and amazingly caught them in mid-air.  I held onto them for dear life until the end of the ride.  


After this, and vendors began selling brightly colored glow sticks/batons/necklaces, flashing rave-style LED toys, and this made me very happy.  Strobe lights going off everywhere, I couldn't stop smiling.  Then, I see it.  The ""Tea Cup"" ride.  There was NO line to wait in.  We rushed into a teacup, and the ride started.  We spun ourselves INCREDIBLY fast, and laughed nonstop.  I think we rode the teacups at least 10 times before the night was through.  


Dizzy and physically exhausted, so we spent another hour laughing, dancing, and smoking at my car before we realized that we were one of the few cars left in the parking lot.  


All-in-all, the experience was definitely a very, very memorable one!

I was extremely sceptical if i need to try or not . I really wanted to given that i have read so many experiences of different people and i always wanted to experience something like that. I got myself a blot and i went away to a remote place with 2 of my closest friends .

I was just surrounded by nature and nothing else. No electricity 

Then i had lunch and somewhere i had read that Pot makes LSD trip stronger and people shouldnt do it when they are on LSD. So i thought let me smoke up a lil then i should be able make the LSD kick in and hence i had a few drags . 10-15 mins in to the trip

I became a little paranoid initially as i could see multiple time frames and it spooked me . Then it stopped . I went inside the cabin and was still having hillarious conversations with my friend. Then suddenly his face became a card and was divided into 4 parts. One part changing color and the other full of graphs. His ears extending . It was like a fast forward photoshop world . This made me even more anxious and i dont wanna lie i did really feel scared. I got out of the cabin and went out for a walk . And wow did the world suddenly change. 

The woods around me was connected to me and they were trying to convey something. I could see patterns everywhere. I saw some beautiful things and there were certain things that were not so nice to me but i had to fight them and the fighting to make things positive around me made the trip even more amazing.

I spoke to my friend about black holes , egyptian  hieroglyphics , trees , nature , birds  and i could see all of them too. It was just incredible. I had complete control and i felt like i was a part of an actual 4d movie . 

I could feel the grass i was sitting on send energy to my body. Sometimes i could not understand the dimension and the things around me felt like they were shifting their positions. It could actually feel widescreen and no matter how close i went to certain things i could see more than i normally could. I could understand the different shades of green and how trees have their unique way of adding ornaments to themselves.

I had close to 3 hours intense trip and when it started going down 
I cant thank my friend enough 

I think people have a wrong notion of LSD (so did i before i did it). It should not be used to party(recreational) is what i feel . LSD is just beautiful and teaches you so much.

I hope this post isn't inappropriate for this subreddit...

I wanted to know if any of you know much or have experienced sex on LSD and what your thoughts are on it? I've done LSD about 6 times now but never really thought about sex while on it. I suppose because there's so much going on that it's the furthest thing from your mind...but I stumbled upon a few forums where people say sex on LSD is mind-blowing and beautiful. Definitely not something to try for your first few trips...having experienced LSD plenty

My bf and I are together for 6 years and we're very much still in love...we heard that it's best to have sex with someone you already love on LSD because it can heighten feelings of love and make you feel strongly connected and emotionally bonded so being with a stranger may give you false feelings of love...also being with a stranger could be scary...lol...so avoid one night stands on LSD! (Good thing that isn't my kind of thing! :) )

So what are your thoughts about sex on LSD. Is it doable during the peak? Or even advisable to attempt sex during the peak? Is it better on the come down? At what point during the trip is it best? ANY thoughts or insight you want to share would be appreciated. Also what dosage do you think we should be on?

Sure, but his life has his own problems. I am not to judge. 

Think about how blessed you are. This life. On this beautiful planet. About how lucky we are to live this life. How blessed we are to be alive. Alive. I could die before I finish typing this.

This life is not what people think. Money. Everyone wants money. But this life is not a pissing contest to see who can get the biggest cash pile. Greed. There is so much greed in this world. This planet is so beautiful and it's inhabitants suck. Why is everything so damn political? So centered around money? No one on the telly talks about how beautiful it is today. No one shares an amazing story that gives faith in humanity. Instead it's about killings

It is not what this life is for. Everyone on this planet will die someday. And guess what. You're not taking anything with you. What you get out of this life, joy, and happiness you had and shared during your life. This political garbage, this ""Well, I'm moving because the president sucks!"", this is all garbage. GARBAGE. Look around. Do you see this world? Do you see the beauty? Can't you feel how blessed you are to be alive? 

You. Every damn one of you. Myself included. We are so lucky. We didn't ask for this life

Wake up, knowing, and fully enjoying this beautiful, BEAUTIFUL planet.

**Trip Report:**

So I had some LSD tabs waiting for a good time

After we get back from the haunted house, my female friend and I dropped one. The drop was approximately at 11:30PM. A little after twelve, I started feeling the effects. Everything was more hilarious and I'd get random urges to do random things. I remember having the urge to tuck my chin and lips into my shirt for no reason. When my friends looked at me, we all started laughing pretty hard. These types of things continued for another hour or two. 

After the hour of the beginning

THE PEAK: 

Later on, even hugged a few. I just felt really close and one with nature. I started ranting about why are we constantly pursuing entertainment through technology, when we got this magnificent world amongst us. I ran towards the lake water and beheld it and started to tear up to a significant degree in awe. The wind was blowing constantly that night. Because of this, my female friend was playing with toilet paper and was letting it blow in the wind. We both agreed it looked amazing. The stream of toilet paper just looked awesome. She gave me a long piece and I danced around with it, letting the wind stream and wave it around. Never had I felt so alive since I was a child. It was very cold out and windy. But we both agreed we were ok with it. We talk about how our bodies are supposed to withstand this weather, we just have spoiled ourselves. The cold was not bothering either of us. After playing around outside, we decided to go back in the tent and eat some fruit. We continued laughing, and visually stimulating (with glow sticks

Around 5AM or so, to bad, to silly, to insightful, to funny, and so on, but at an extremely rapid rate. It was scary for what seemed like about an hour, if it's bad

I started coming down slowly, and headed to my friends' home. Everything is going by so slowly. 5 minutes seem like 20. My female friend drops my male friend off at work, we go home and watched the first two episodes of  Carl Sagan's The Cosmos. The episodes were absolutely amazing and insightful. We then head off to bed. It took me 2-3 hours to go to sleep. Once I finally do, I sleep for an hour and wake up 100% sober. Mind was still in awe for a little while, but in don't think I was under the influence anymore.

All and all, it seemed perfect. I feel as though I've been reborn. I feel as if I'm changed for the better, but not sure what have changed about me. Not yet, at least, as I am submitting the trip report the day after I dropped. ",,False,t5_2qhvj,True

I can't really put into words how truly amazed my friends and I were. Almost all of us started tearing up at one point or another just at the sheer beauty of what we were seeing and hearing.

Luckily we'd timed our dosages just perfectly to be at our peak when they started playing. When they started up their light show the only way I could describe it properly was by staring completely wide-eyed with my jaw practically on the floor trying to mouth ""HOLY SHIT"" but not really succeeding. They were kind enough to supply a psychedelic visualisation of their music behind themselves when they were playing and put on an amazing light show to boot.
 
I felt what was like a perfect resonation of notes and rhythm within my body as they played. One song melted into the next one in my mind and their instrumentals were fascinating to watch and completely unexpected which was lovely. I know we mixed in MDMA so it wasn't 100% due to the LSD but my goodness did it add a positive spin on the whole night! At the moment I can't fathom a combination of friends

The experience of watching Tame Impala in a whole new way got me even more excited to see what else is good. I know people say that LSD really heightens your appreciation of music but our feeble minds weren't ready for that much appreciation!

""what lsd feels like.  It feels like eveetrtthing you're used to seeing is different so its like your always having to readjust yourself to make sense of the new rules.??? Music has a effect on the way everrything looks vice versa.

part of me forgets i actually took anything. As if this is what life feels like always but it cant be true... So many colors and bumps and the keyboard is hard to focus on and im lozing track of my fingures and the music is all over the walls.

yup its working.

part of you forgets that youre experienceing a trip and it tries to covnvince itself its real. But it's not real. The room is spinnning and colors are mixing everywhere. I wish I could paint now.

The Funeral Band of horses [song]

water is flowing everywhere now damnit lol... Now that im experiencing it again for myself in its most poowerful nature i dont think its possible for me to ever be able to explain to you what im feeling right now but I WISH YOU COULD FEEL IT RIGHT NOW!

its sad because its always all in your head. This unforuntately isnt what life is. No freedom to express and mold. and become one. beautiful

Trying to see if maybe each time i've done acid the trip has just been like this but i just didnt remember it to be this way. Maybe it was just as intense. 

It changes how everything feels and sounds to you. Also how it looks. Colors constantly change. Looks like I might be repeating myself. Some Daft Punk is playing now.

Whats normal isnt normal to a user under the influence of very good lsd.

Your mind starts to trick you. Makes you think that this all makes sensee. Even if I wasnt on acid it would make sense to me because this is how life IS. But it isn't.

It's funny because my body has to keep adjusting to the new changes in SOUND FEEL SEE THINKING

It makes you stand up to think. You stand and think about what you're going to do but stop yourself from going through it cause in real life it wouldnt look natural.

The sounds sound different its hard to understand them. It's as if life is music. All the colors are mixing together. Im not sure if it's raining outside or if it's just me. 

I've been trying to get out of my room to draw or paint for the past 20 minutes but it feels like an eternity. 

I'm not sad it's taking so long b

This isnt for everyone. It's going to make you look at life differently for sure afterwards.. On different level that can't even be explained. Fuck this normal words they dont do me justice!!!

It tries to make everything seem normal when it's not normal. So hard to describe. 

Colors are so bold and changing shapes over and over. Kind of sounds like water is being turn upside down as if you're emptying a bottle.

Still trying to figure if this is natural or not. Probably not natural. But my brain wants to convince it is. It's  trying its hardest to make sense of everything but sense can never be found in this dimension. 

The music is what makes this trip so enjoyable. Animal Collective and MGMT make sense. Everything could make sense maybe then? Perhaps if I went outsdie everything would remain this way.

I doubt that.

Definitely makes you question what's real and what isn't real. Between liquid and physical. As if i never took the lsd. As if this is what life is always like. Colors flying mixing and turning with the music
If only life was this beautiful. Looks like count dracula from sesame street?

Driving is a no go. The lines start to mix together and make patterns. You're head tricks you into thinking this is how life is but it isn't by far. It's trying to rationalize itself.

Feeels like the world is contantly moving. I'm forgetting thing's I had promised from before and keep mixing them with what I think is important at the momemnt? 

Colors change, feelings change, everything changes to insane ways you can't even imagine. There is no way to comprehend this feeling. I'm typing it because I want to share my expeirence.

Nobody else is seeing life this way :( This is what j meant by you can't share things sometimes

Grizzly bear on a neck on a spit. [song]

Ice cream melts from your mouth then everything melts from itself?

Its gets hotter then colder out of nowhere. I forgot if I took the drug. You're lucky I have this here to type on.

you would love this mix of taste, freedom. I question if anyone else can see what I see. Probably not. The music is beautiful and it makes my game more enmjoyable. 

My teemamtes is staring at me as if i did something wrong. Sounds like my friends judge me. The way they talk to me. Feel like my phone is vibrating and making noises when it shouldnmt.

There are echoe's everywhere. Colors get brighter and darker and twist and turn. Everything just melts away. Belinds beautifuly. 

Playing BF3 feels like im also playing DayZ at the same time so I confuse keybinds for each other.

Promised someone that in BF3 if he was the pilot i'd be the co-pilot and wouldn't fire any shots at all just as long as I can watch him fly and just enjoy the ride.

I forgot how long ago my dad left us for work... 2 days ago?

I need to hug you hard after this.

Anxiety is nothing but a bad habit, put up sticky notes if you have to. Another thing that helped settled my anxiety was sipping on pure orange juice VERY SLOWLY lol. It slows down the racing thoughts and visuals. You’ll get through the trip fine and with no regrets if you get the set/setting right. Go into it with the intention to resolve any issue, including anxiety, and so shall it be! Meditation, yoga and reading books like “The Alchemist” by Paulo Coelho in the preceding weeks helps you go into the trip feeling more positive and relaxed, which is important especially if you suffer with chronic anxiety.  Love you guys colorfully!

**My trip report:**

About 2 weeks back, but I don’t recall experiencing any and this was good considering I had suffered with severe anxiety on an everyday basis.

So everyone starting doing their own thing and being amazed with the awesome visuals but I was uneasy, I felt as if I couldn’t even stand or walk but I’m pretty sure it was all in my head and that I was walking about just fine. I began to feel overwhelmed by all the movement and my mind was flooding with thoughts. I started to puke...more than once. I remember feeling a lot of emotional pain whilst puking. It was as if each time I had puked, all the negative things that I had said and done to myself and others in my life had emptied itself from me leaving space for something that I couldn’t figure out what at the time. After each time I had puked, I felt more and more in control. I felt alive. Slowly, with the help of my sister, I settled into the moment. I started noticing gentle movements in everything, the tile patterns were moving, and then I started to feel extreme happiness and love.

   

The peak was all colourful and pretty but it was during the come-down that I experienced those life-changing moments. I began to understand how the world works, I actually looked new. My skin was glowing and I could finally look at myself in the mirror without any complexes or thoughts about having imperfections. I felt reborn. My soul was delighted that it was free to roam about in this body. I had remembered things that I had been doing in life that was not serving me. I found resolutions to so many issues and I’m more capable of controlling my anxiety now.

Lsd helped me to see the love in everyone and in myself. The feeling I got is that we are one, about love and oneness and spreading happiness by being happy, but it’s hard to apply those things and know the true power of it until you experience it. LSD helped me experience it.

Funnily enough, would be a fun experience. I was not searching for fun though. Rather, I was searching to seek some sort of deep underlying understanding that I had been reading about for months in my personal studies of Buddhism. I knew what enlightenment was, but as I'm sure many of you can understand, I never actually knew what it was. I could recite a textbook definition, but I could never fully understand it in the same way one can accept that the earth is millions of miles away from the sun but not fully understand the scale of it.

Rewind to December 1st. My significant other and I had each acquired enough LSD for the two of us. We were reluctant as we placed the paper on our tongues

After four or five hours, I could see it shifting and undulating like water. I won't bother to explain my hallucinations in any further detail as they were fascinating but are not relevant to this. She and I left her house and went to a nearby river because the thought of the house, the walls, the construction, all the technology around us, just began to feel so unnatural and uneasy. It almost felt disgusting to be in a house because all it seemed to do was shelter me from the world around.

Ten minutes later, but I simply did not care as I normally would. I felt no difference between the molecules of the falling water and those of my skin. I thought to myself, ""Why do we about protecting ourselves from rain? Why do we shelter ourselves so much from nature?"" I had never felt so connected to the natural world in my entire life. I felt no different than the bark on the trees, the slick mud on the ground, or the running river below. I noticed a homeless man's shelter a ways down the river, and did not feel pity for him. In a way, I almost felt jealous that he was not bound to society and its norms. He was free to be one with the universe and had no need to worry about getting a job or paying for college. We also came to the conclusion that the iPhone was the pinnacle of mankind's existence

Everything I had ever thought before began to collapse

When we returned from the river, and at this point I questioned the plans I had set up for my life. I realized my goal was to make money so that I could live a happy life, but after feeling repulsed by the thought of money, you could imagine how I felt about selling my soul to become a wealthy code monkey. I did not want to be stuck in the classic gilded cage scenario. I should include that this experience lead me to change my major from computer science and follow a less lucrative path that I actually love -- geology. This decision has improved my life more than I can explain, and I feel like I am actually going to do something worthwhile with my short consciousness on earth.

Now that we had returned home, I am not sure why I was not disgusted by the hot tub as I was with everything else manmade. As we rested within the warm water, we began to talk incessantly. When I say incessantly, I mean literally constant talking. We could not hold back speaking because every word that came from our mouths was a new revelation for us. It was very overwhelming to have acquired this newfound understanding with the world around us.

At this time, and I felt no emotion other than relief and release. I had no motivation or aspirations, I was not an intellectual or programmer anymore, I did not have a place in the universe or society, I simply was. I was nothing at all and everything in the universe. This was by far the most important part of my trip. I finally felt and understood everything I had been reading about.

In this phase of ego-death,"" or, ""It is what it is and nothing else, that's all.""

The trip in total lasted about twelve or thirteen hours, I did achieve nirvana in the end regardless of the means. If you think it is not true enlightenment as it was reached through alternate means, feel free to think so.

As any LSD user will tell you, I woke up completely sober and my thoughts felt muddy compared to how they did the night before. The impulses of ""check your phone"" and ""you need to do your homework"" returned, and I was back to my original state of deluded thinking. But for a wonderful 13 hour period, I had a window into the truth behind everything.

A complete shutdown of the left hemisphere of my brain is what I experienced. The childlike wonder with the universe rushed back in, time, anything manmade, was thrown out the window. I was nothing at all yet I was everything. Nature was profoundly beautiful in ways that are inexpressible with words. I simply wanted to love everyone and everything, even those who at the time I had thought I hated (a word which I refrain from using now).

1373827301.0,1iaea2,First trip report [400 µg],BurningPandama,34,8,11,"WARNING THIS POST IS REALLY LONG



This is my first trip report so it probably won't be that good but I give it a shot. 

This happened last week
We where chilling at our tents listening to music when we dropped the acid. I was the most experienced person there and I did to hits of Tesselate's WoW
the third guy was doing this his first time (Lets call him Turbo) only did one Wow (that's still 200µg). We decided to start the experience by listening to ""Portugal. The Man"" (the album in the mountain in the cloud is awesome from start to finish)
I knew that when we got to the last song (sleep forever) we would have started tripping pretty good. The perception of time got distorted as we just sat there without a care in the world. We started at about 4 pm and by 5:30 we were just sitting there watching the sun
and the cloud and the trees (remember sunglasses if you are outside kids!). Then The girls we were camping with started coming over at that time
So when  they arrived there was more conversation and they were naturally curious to what we were feeling/seeing etc. 

I was controlling the music so we were listening to things like the beatles, ratatat, of montreal, the shins, miike snow and blockhead (When tripping a like music that transitions between songs so listening to whole albums are mot unheard of)
When the people around us started getting more drunk I got some candy from my tent (individually packed chocolate bars) and the taste was unrivaled
At this point I ditched my shoes so i could feel the grass
At this point my friend Turbo got increasingly annoying
When he screamed (maybe he yelled)

I grabbed my go bag and whet down to a 30 meter high hill next to the water
laying there. After the negative energy at the camp I ""reset"" my trip so it would not go bad. Looking at the sky and the clouds

When walking into the woods I could really feel that the wood was alive
every step i felt the ground get pushed down and lift up for every step (like the ground was breathing) and thought I was a great metaphor for the relationship between humans and earth
but if you step in the same spot often and had the earth would not recover anymore. This caused me to arrive at the conclusion that all people that wear shoes are dirty peasants that don't appreciate the earth enough.

Now I had walked so far that I got to the end of the peninsula and arrived at a [beach](http://imgur.com/WscEfuI) made of pretty big rocks (2-10 cm i diameter) and it hurt like hell to walk on without shoes. the ocean was a deep blue color and hypnotized me with it's looks and sound and wanted to get down to the 
wateredge. on the way there I realized that on the beach someone had constructed big circles of stones (5-10 of them
But i had to start somewhere so what the hell. after 5 minutes I had a small circles and when into Zen mode
When i looked at the other circles of stone i saw I was like a moat around them


[HERE IS a PIC of my circle](http://imgur.com/MjA3iha)


in digital cameras laying next to some rock and decided I wanted to take it back to the recycling station near the camp as a favor to the earth. before leaving i sat down in my circle play harmonica and watching the [sun start to set](http://imgur.com/yuYGqKK) (Outside the wall by pink floyd is awesome on harmonica)



While walking back I felt I was coming down (coming down is my favorite part) and i got a glow stick from my go bag
I got back and after recycling the battery I decided to reconnect with a old friend I hadn't met in a year (she had been away on a exchange program) after using a good amount of time to describe the place we had our tents I finally saw her. she was in the company of her friend and her (almost-)identical twin. I was still pretty high at this point and couldn't tell the difference between the sisters.
She looked so stunning on acid that I was at a loss for words. I was contemplating telling her I was on drugs so she would understand but opted for giving her a hug and telling her what concert we should meet at later.




At this point it was 1, I walk a little slow so the girls had to almost walk me like a dog, but they seemed to enjoy it. the entire time they were eating I was just standing there looking at stuff.
everyone probably knew I was high on something. one the way back they were talking about how cute I was and how I reminded them of a dog
had taught earlier in the day. 

We went to the concert (I was still barefoot) I really liked the music but felt like an outcast in this environment
While standing near the front of the crowd i felt I deserved this music more than them

then we sat down where we started it all and put on the album ""the year of hibernation"" by youth lagoon while discussing our different trips (it was only me

Focus on the self. The stickiness between your fingers and the dirt in your nails. Focus on your body shape, after you've done that and decided that you like the way things are, then focus on the mind. The human mind is extremely dense and it's amazing to know that even our own mind can hold so many secrets even from us. It all waters down to us just being a vessel, we carry the mind we have with us for a lifetime and then what? Does it go somewhere? Who cares, the point is we have it for as long as we have it, so let's enjoy it and extract every single bit that we can from it, delve into the idea that is the collective unconscious where our entire history has been written and make our mark there, that we have expressed our artistic creativity and undertook an endeavor worth someone else's time.

(11:45pm) I guess I was listening to music for quite awhile because I didn't take my headphones off for another 30 minutes. This is when things started going downhill. I noticed my dog was barking uncontrollably upstairs at something, and I put my headphones back in.

1363759297.0,1andap,Trip Report : my first experience back in '97,ChromeMitchell,27,3,6,"Hi Everyone

Way back before RCs were passed as LSD, and it was kinda boring. I ask my friend that lived there if he had any drugs besides weed. At first he said ""no"" then it dawned on him that he had some acid. It was a was a shock to even him; because he had forgotten about it. About two years earlier he was selling it and a 10strip slipped between two parts of his stereo. We proceeded to take apart the stereo and sure enough, there it was.  

Out of the six of us that decided to take it, myself and an other good friend were over excited and took two tabs each, not being smart enough to know anything about dose sizes at all. We put on Austin powers to kill time and laugh. About a half hour later the other four people decided to drop too. 

When it first hit me

I get up and go talk to the other guy on 2hits chain smoking. He was tripping face too and was pissed at me for falling asleep. We talk for a bit and then the others are at back door telling us ""it's time to smoke"" 

We all go into the garage and start a session. My girl looks amazing to me and I'm all lovey dovey. After a few hits I'm in a whole other headspace that is indescribable. My girl starts talking to me asking if she should take one of the remaining doses
My girl leaves and I return to the trippers circle of pot smoking in the garage. We are all starting to go off the rails now and everyone is commenting how strong the acid was in comparison to previous experiences. I knew no different

We sat and smoked in that garage for hours on end. We'd have on just a black light for a while then switch back to the regular lights, like splinter from tmnt, and  then stayed that way for a while, while he moved around and talked. I laughed hysterically at this. One of the craziest things I experienced was the feeling of ""thinking"" from my left knee. Basically it felt like my consciousness, for a while, was centered in my left knee. Impossible to explain.  

Other highlights, that little point of light would flash every sec or so, and when it flashed I would see a thirteen story high mech cube (looked like the borg ship from star trek) suspended above the room. 

I stood in the bathroom pulling bites of chrome off the door handle and watching them bubble and disappear for what felt like 30min and only decided to leave the bathroom because I thought I heard a friend call to me... Which he didn't do at all. 

At a late point in the night we all tried to sleep and I had amazing Closed Eyes Experiences. Visuals don't do it justice. There was all sorts of spacial and tactile feelings to the experiences. I pictured/felt my body being reassembled in tiny chunks like in the 5th element

It may have been the most intense acid trip I've ever had because it was my first time, I know it was more then that and I know it was LSD, but I really don't desire to go to that level again.

However


All in all the acid trip was honestly kind of boring


The craziness occurred last night. Me and about 5 other people were sitting on my friends sofa smoking weed (my first time smoking since I dropped acid) and I tripped way harder than I did when on acid. I only smoked one joint too. I have smoked 3 grams by myself before and never felt anything close to this.  I am very confident it could not have been the weed.


My mind started going places completely outside the room. For a solid ten minutes I was thinking about the life of some random lady in a shopping mall. I could literally see the products she was shopping for, everything looked too bright, like if you spend all day in absolute darkness then walk outside at noon. That little layer of blinding light that covers everything was making it impossible to see anything in my friends living room.


Eventually, I just got up and left.


Except it became even more awkward because once I got in my car I sat in his driveway for fucking 40 minutes thinking I was on an airplane! I could hear the airplane engine and see the people sitting next to me and everything. Then the plane crashed and I was kind of reborn in my car at which point I made the short drive home.


At home I just laid in my bed for about an hour and contemplated the universe with my eyes closed. Things were very clear and visual to me. I basically came to the conclusion the entire universe centered around me and now it was my turn to ascend to my realm, it's very hard to remember now but back then it made perfect sense.


All in all


Sorry it was such a long read but is any of that possible at all? Even I am having a hard time believing it. All my friends who have done shrooms/acid/etc have never reported any of that and I have researched/googled the fuck out of it without finding anything.

We went for a smokebreak and everyone naturally tried to look for the effects

We went in to the livingroom and started to watch Pink Floyd - The wall (movie) and hoped the effects would kick in really soon, so just let it come to you.

I had seen the movie a few times before, the pen just moved naturally and everything seemed normal. Friend one watched me while I drew it and I think it kicked in at the same time for both of us. 

Then everyone started sweating like hot showers, cool spots on the wall, a cool painting, the cat in the house suddenly coming in to the room etc. My friend started to tickle me and it felt like I fell from a cliff. Don't get me wrong, I was fully aware of where I was and what was happening, but the constant feeling of falling was so intense and real. 

Then nothing special happened, youtube, music etc - and then we went to jam some music. Everyone was really into it, even though it was a trainwreck to listen to, then friend two's aunt came in and told us something. Oh, I forgot. Everyone was tripping really hard by this point and sweating; so we all were shirtless - might be weird to see. At that moment I got really paranoid and very nervously touchy. If I saw the cat suddenly behind me I would jump and yell, this continued for the rest of my night.

His uncle came in later, but me and Friend one got really paranoid and scared. We then went on to get a sober friend to join us, just so he could manage situations like that, and keep us company.

After getting him there, talked and just had an amazing experience just knowing where we actually were. 

In the middle of the road, drinking beer, smoking cigarettes and trying to open a orange with a lighter. It was the best goddamn feeling in the world. We saw some lights in the distance and wanted to check it out. Turns out the local bowling ally had a party night so we somehow decided to go play. Playing bowling with intense party music, black light, strobe light and a lazershow - all while tripping pretty hard on acid was one of the most fun things I've ever done in my life. We went back home, sweating an awful amount and all that jazz.

Then I really don't remember anything specific. Mostly talking, went for a long walk, smoked waaaay to many cigs and had a really chill time. We busted the cat in the house of really being a human being trapped in a cats body, because he knew way to much about how we reacted to stuff (ok, just funny). 

Then we watched pinapple express and wanted to smoke some hash, not as strong as the first few hours, but seriously nothing to take for granted.

I came home at 07/08 in the morning and was still tripping

While walking the festival grounds though, there was a circle of people that really stood out from the crowd and they were dressed over the top in ""hippie"" clothing. I was already a little trippy

*Who were these people?

*Were they one of the families that produce the stuff?

*Who the heck has liquid LSD on hand?


I had a **great** time and don't know whether to be mad or thank them!


EDIT: Sure, until I realized the slight burn/electric/tingle feeling on my arm and cheek. I had an optimistic attitude right after and thought if it is, it is, and I'm about to trip harder, and if not, then it wasn't. I didn't feel like I was doomed to trip harder. But between the very different feeling of the liquid that I felt all day on my arm and cheek, the way that circle of people looked, I just lean closer to the fact that I was sprinkled with two drops of liquid acid. It's just my experience,,

1366324167.0,1cmz92,Just had some seriously MIND BLOWING thoughts while tripping today :0,lskb,27,5,15,"That feeling.  The general ""feeling"" in the room.

Everyone is feeling the same feeling when they're around you.  
The general atmophere is shared by all.   It is not something that we experience as individual experiencers.

'Two people are together and the feeling changes in the room.'  
--&gt;What does this mean?

This is the feeling that I'm talking about.  The feeling is something we all do at the same time. Me over here, that's why it feels different.   

Its an illusion to think that we're separate experiencers.  There is only the one experiencer

Notice Jim doesn't feel angry.  It feels angry in the area we call ""Jim"".  *It*

When two people talk they are forced to confront the ""feeling"" in the room together.  It is a ""feeling *with*"" someone.  To think that one sometimes feels *with* and at other times feels solo would be a mistake.  People have a tendency to separate themselves and go off feeling the world on their own.  This can sometimes make one think that one is in it alone

.


The journey has only just began.  But I had no idea what awaits.

Headphones on.  Music will show me the way.

So familiar.  But so much deeper.  It's everywhere.

 .


Eyes closed.

Beanbag

 .


&gt;Sounds I had never heard before... But I had listened to this 100 times.  Must be another wave length.

The subtle notes are important.  They are not just background noise.

In fact the background noise is the most important.  It is keeping me grounded... The guitar is pulling me away .. out ... up...

 .


Things get faster... no colours though .. infact white.. very white.

White is scary... Sign of death.  But I am not scared.  It's not real.  I'm sure.

 .


&gt;Each note is now a fragment of time.  The gaps in-between are void.

Each note is further away from my body.  Is this safe?  Where am I going?

&gt;&gt;I must hold on to the background noise.

 .


I've hit a wall .. my room is holding me... It doesn't want to let go.  Time snaps back together

Headphones off... 

&gt;Everything is very slippery...

I want to go... I trust the music.

I trust if the music takes me .. It will bring me home.

 .


Exhale.

&gt;And things where never the same again.

&gt;Life changing.

 .


This may be too much... I have to trust the music.

I put my headphones on.... and then I put my headphones on.

That was weird.

 .


Looking at my roof... It's taking me... I can't hold on to the ambient background noise any longer.

It literately opens up like the heavens .. a portal.

&gt;I'm almost laughing at this point... Smiling so much ... I know what's coming ..

&gt;Take me.

 .


I close my eyes...Preparing myself.

Instantly time starts to fall apart again... I'm riding the guitar notes through time .. towards the white .. and through it.

Just as long as I have the background noise I am safe... It tells me where home is... so I can leave.

 
.

.

 

I don't know where I am .. but I am far far away.

 .


There is nothing... no colours ... no feelings... no breathing.

wait.. no breathing.. I must remember to breath.

As I check... I feel the air in my lungs.. My body is in a bubble.

My body is not important... It will take care of it self.

The bubble vanishes .. I know I can bring it back to check on it... It doesn't worry me.

 .


All there is

&gt;and the background noise keeping me safe... reminding me of home. 

earth.

 .


The notes are forming a spiral... I can see each instance of time ... as I float past each one I hear it.

Slower.. faster.. louder...directions

This is great.  I can control this.  And I know my body is safe.

 .


&gt;&gt;&gt;And then suddenly... the background noise stops ...

All reality I know vanishes behind me. 

&gt;It's like ... Imagine your a kid... on a bike for the very first time... and your parents are holding/pushing you ... you trust them

&gt;Everything is fun your having a good time.. your safe.

&gt;And then they let go... 

That freedom.  But I'm not slowing down.

Now I am worried.

 .


I know this guitar ends soon .. What If I took my headphones off...

I know I could... Things are very very intense.

If I take them off .. I lose..

I trust the music.

I start smiling again.

Give me all you've got.

 .


I experience what can only be described as the most amazing ending to a song there ever was.

 .


Ahhh it's over ... and the ambient noise is back!  but this time It's here with me ...

but wait .. where is here?

 .


&gt;&gt;&gt;So pure

 .


This ambient noise is nice.

Wait .. What's that infront of me... and around me... I hear .. factory sounds .. and squealing.

A colour! Red... things are turning red... and hot.

I look down .. I'm not sure how I know that it is down .. being I am a orb in 3 dimensional space.

Fire!

 .


Wait .. I'm in something .. like a carriage in a conveyor belt but suspended.  Very cyber punk esk.

There's a feeling of a presents in the distance to the side of me... I can't really see it... looking towards it I only see ambient shapes.

&gt;It's defiantly some kind of anti-god.

&gt;It's defiantly looking at me.

&gt;It's defiantly getting closer.

 .


The squealing getting louder...

Screaming starts in the sound ... normally it would be very prominent I recognise the song ... but it just blends into the background noise... The industrial sounds overpower everything.

 .


I see other carriages like mine in the distance ... they are on fire.  This is where the squealing is coming from?

&gt;I have a shield that protects me.  It's like I'm not meant to be here.  Nothing seams to effect me.

 .


&gt;The figure feels like he's getting closer and closer but I can't tell I can only sense.

I think he's screaming at me.

His anger is terrifying.

 .


This lasts awhile.

 .


I think I need a break... This is too much.

&gt;I take my headphones off,

I open my eyes.

woah.

mmm

I can still here the screaming. I could stop it.

But wait ummm ... where am I.  This feels very unfamiliar.

I'm on my beanbag but... I'm not ready to be here ... I'm somewhere far far away in space and time... Coming back like this is cheating.

I can see writing on the screen... The writing... it

and colours ... colours are .. out .... They are not what they are supposed to be.

I'm not ready for this place... I have to go back.

.
 

The music has changed .. IT immediately takes me away.  I'm gone again.

 .


&gt;Wait I recognise more of this sound .. It's .. It's the first song .. but BACKWARDS....

This is so amazing ... All I can do is considerate on the song now ... It's actually becoming more happy .. as it becomes happy.. the red fades away.

.. I have to tell people of this experience.  This get me thinking ... Going back .. if that wasn't back.. where was it.. was that my lounge?

 .


I'm trying to figure out consciousness.. and how I can be so far away from my body ... It's not even about distance.. It's about feeling.

I'm a little worried that I will never get home .. but then I remember I trust the music .. I must tell other people of this experience.

That seams very .. very important .. other people must know ... that seams like my only ticket home.

 .


But for now I am further away then ever.

 .


Patterns start appearing around me.. In sync with the song.  It's like .. I'm inside a spaceship... It's very dark and cold I can hardly make anything out.

&gt;I have a body.. my body .. It's here with me .. for the first time. 

I'm lying down ... Same position I would be on the bean bag ... I can't move.

There's figures moving around beside me..

 .


I look down ... I'm half dissected.  Theres blood and tissue hanging out everwhere.

&gt;&gt;The song lets me know everything is okay.

From my shoulders down I completely open.  There is machines above me with hundreds of points... It's like they are working on me .. operating on me.

It feels like they are enhancing me. 

 .


I just lye there.

 .


When I look up I start seeing information.. I'm looking at what seams to be a holigram that goes are far as I can see ...

almost like a map.. almost like stars... 

 .


I can make it out ..

It's Hexes ... like DNA .. It's all around me at the moment.  But it's split up... As I get close to one it looks like hundreds of tiny capsules.  I must figure this out.

I look back down ... now I am in one of these capsules .. floating around.. I get closer and closer to these hexes ... until I match up with one...  I slot in .. perfectly.

These capsules .. They have the presents of people!  I cant see in they are just white ... Infact I can't even see my body again.

 .


Then something strange happens .. I leave my capsule and start floating past others ... the one immidiatly above me I reconize ... It's [Friends/flatmates name here]!

I float past more and more and .. I can hear talking and thoughts on the inside ... I can even see people moving inside some of them .. like a TV.

&gt;&gt;But wait ... I look back and I can see my capsule and .. I start to forget ... I start to forget who I am.

 .


As I relies this all the hexes start moving again ... my capsule is long gone.

I still have the same persona... But if I try to remember any details about myself... I struggle.

&gt;The music tells me this is okay.

 .


As I float around absorbing the beauty of the building blocks of life

 .


The music changes again .. back to factory sounds ... but it gets very quite..

&gt;I'm back in the same place as before...  What would be described as hell.

Still not afraid.

 .


I can now tell I am slipping away ... That I may never come back.. That maybe the music doesn't have me after all.

Red ... fire... etc.

 .


The prominate creature approaches me again .. but this time seams like he is communicating..

&gt;&gt;""This is it.  Your free. You can go.""

I can't tell if his motives are pure.  But it honestly feels like I could break free ... and I would be gone from this life forever.

&gt;The song is very very quite now .. and for the first time .. I don't think I could take my headphones off .. even if I really needed too.

.
 

The gravity of my options.

I considered my options.

 .


""No.

I must tell people of this experience... It is too important.. Everybody must know... Everybody must experience it.""

 .


##So here I am.  Spreading the tale of my journey.  What happened next isn't really that important.  The music comes back.. Gets louder... The spaceship comes back and give me my pod and I come back to earth .. my earth.  And I spend until this point right now thinking about this experience constantly

It was my spring break this week, but the world around it was just to damn interesting and we wound up for the first thirty minutes of the trip sitting next to the aquarium in a small patch of sand, not knowing how to handle ourselves. After about thirty minutes, I was getting anxious so we decided to walk around the city. Mind you during this time we decided barefoot was the way to go so we wound up walking around Charleston ( a pretty rich, very beautiful historic place if you have never been) without shoes. I felt so connected to the earth and the people around me simply by feeling the earth under my feet. As we walked around, my anxiety faded away and was replaced with a sense of energy, happiness, I felt as if I could read them very well and sense their immediate thoughts about me when I talked to them. After a couple of hours, and beautiful people made me feel as if I was in paradise. We wound up meeting back up with our friends and walking to a pier to stare at the water. We could see the water move from schools of fish being chased by this dolphin. It was surreal to say the least. The acid wore off

what I learned---

we are all equal

I am more grateful than ever for all I have in my life. My parents are great and I felt a strong connection to my mom even though she was miles away. 

I want to help people with my life. I'm studying engineering and my goal is to work on sustainable energy so we don't have to destroy the environment in order to live well. 

material possessions are nice, and neighbors are all we ever have in life, and they should be cherished. 

all life is holy. from a rat to a human

life is complicated, but I believe there is more to this reality than what we see. I believe there is something deeper, as if the entire fabric of the universe is ordered into one single being which some call god. 

all of these thoughts were running through my head the entire day, and felt terrible that many people grow up without that luxury.

I'm still relatively new to psychedelics but my last two trips (one on LSD, language, and love. I feel that I'm foraying into new territory that is starting to alienate me socially and I find this a little troubling. I'm posting this to r/LSD to hear your guys' thoughts on where/how far the rabbit hole has taken you. Should be quite interesting and I hope to spark some deep thoughts here so don't be afraid to type away! Below I will share some things I've learned and how they have put me into this troubled state I'm in.

It will help you to know that I'm a huge fan of Terence McKenna, I want to say. That is why as intelligent species humans have developed language. Language is there to connect our minds, allowing us to share thoughts, share emotions, and innovate. Terence describes this as a form of telepathy and I totally agree. Mark Pesce said, ""We are linguistic creatures first and foremost...(language) is how we are."" I now see that LOVE naturally falls in with connection/language. Love is a powerful word indeed. I'm still trying to have a deeper understanding of love but I'm sure that if/when I do, it will extremely difficult to translate to words anyway (as it already is

Bleh

- the eschaton (the end)
- existence of aliens (What's all this Pleiadian stuff?)
- Government conspiracy (Chemtrails
- connections to the Christianity (I'm agnostic/atheist)

As you can see, but no one ever accepts that this can happen in their lifetime. I see the logic of the eschaton, I think. Most people describe the event as a singularity. And if you think about the evolution of humans and technology, you will see that everything is becoming more and more connected, especially since the invention of the Internet. Marc Pesce said this phenomenon will bring about a ""global awareness"" or ""self-realization"" or something. So it all kinda makes sense, although I don't think we're quite there yet.

But let me wrap this up. As you can see, mind you lol). Sometimes I feel the need to vomit all my thoughts onto someone's mind but I know most of my friends wouldn't last 1 minute in a conversation or would just think I'm a crazy hippy. I love the psychedelic experience but I'm suddenly a little bit frightened again. I basically feel that with psychedelics I'm traveling a shamanic path. And I guess I'm a little scared of where and how far this path will take me. However, I have 5 dried grams of psilocybe cubensis in my desk drawer...

It was effing awesome! 

**12:40:** So, but we felt pretty safe and ready, and we weren't going to think about it. If we felt like crossing the street, well, we'd cross the street by ourselves. If not, the room was fine.

We took it and went for a walk, as well as other outdoor areas full of trees.  I wasn't nearly as confused as last time, even though I was tripping just as hard, so I managed to be a good guide. We walked back to her apartment.

We had bought a rainbow pinwheel, we spent almost a half hour trying to make the pinwheel spin, placing it in different spots on the ground outside, and going back inside to look at it through the bedroom window. I knew it had started.

She wanted to eat a cookie, and her eyes widened. ""…wow."" It tasted so different.

**13:30**: It was hitting us hard about 45min later. Things started breathing and moving

I decided we had to go outside, bright, and shiny, and the half mile walk seemed to take so much longer than normal. All I wanted was to sit down and enjoy the feeling i was trying to hold down so hard. I tried to talk about commonplace things to keep myself and my friend down to earth until we reached a safe spot. A few cars and trucks drove by- the people's faces seemed to be judging us and almost turning into monsters out of the corner of my eye, but i knew it was all in my mind. We walked and walked, through the quiet sidewalk under branches and canopies of trees, around palm trees, fountains, until we reached the beach. Things were slightly more purple and magenta

The beach was the most amazing visual experience. There were a handful of people we quickly walked away from

Wow.

We kept talking about how we saw those ""timelapses of clouds rolling by really fast from the movies"" in real life. I can't explain it more perfectly than that. I had never seen the outdoors while peaking

The beach was also a little scary. I was keeping my cool, fish, leaves fall, and fish jump out of the water.  I wanted to keep pointing every single thing I saw to her, but each of us was listening to different music and appreciating different things, sharing something every now and then. Everything was extremely intense, every sound, every voice echoed, rolling cloud moved beautifully to the music and shimmered with life. Dragonflies zoomed past and around us
My friend thought it was super intense

**15:30:** Finally

...Oh. and the roommates parents came to a surprise visit. We heard their voices

I laid out watercolors, but my favorite medium is charcoal, so I wasn't as into it as she was. It was hard to keep focused or even produce what my mind wanted to on the paper since I don't practice with paint much. I used charcoal on my first time and lost myself into it, just like my friend was doing with watercolors.

Meditating was amazing, but on acid the connection with the inside of oneself and the awareness of the outside is so much easier to feel and stronger. I felt instantly in deep sleep but completely aware of everything, in complete stillness, feeling the music through me and in the visuals. I sometimes have a lot of trouble with self-consciousnes and insecurity depending on what's going on with my life, and once again while tripping I realize that I don't need to ever feel that way.  I wanted my friend to meditate, but I realized she couldn't sit still. I think it was because of the roommate's parents being in the house, although they were in and out and obviously didn't care about whatever we were doing. She kept checking her phone, and doing all sorts of different things

We ate lots of fruit, causing a beautiful, yellowish strobe light effect in the cool blue lighting in the room. I put my hands in the air and looked at them interact with the things above, far and below, in and out of focus. I closed them, waved them, moved them, and clothing didn't make a lot of sense. My friend kept on painting.

I also played the guitar. All I could remember was ""the House of the Rising Sun, not much. My friend kept asking why the songs ""weren't playing right"" out of her phone or her computer- I am pretty sure they were just fine, but they did sound really odd.

Ok, so you will have to excuse any weirdness and strange grammatical phantoms that may appear from time to time. WooOooOo! 

I saw
(and I've been doing this shit for over 15 years). This was some brutal shit. Trust me.


Lets set the picture a bit. I recently made a friend who I sometimes make music with. Dylan (or whatever). I sometimes used to spend time at his place and jamming and just doing guy fun stuff. A new ""friend"" I guess. He seemed pretty cool. We like similar music. That's always good.;

So I live with my GF (who is fucking amazing, I just need you to understand how well loved she is and a bit of a local hero). Spends her life helping the community, genuinely, and massively respected by ""jail folk"" (who my GF helps, she's a lawyer / social worker / all around local hero). She's a fucking wonderful human being. She makes others feel good. She brings good into the world. 

 She's also not to be fucked with. Oh dear god no. 

Anyways my friend came around and we all decided to trip at ours (which brings me to my story finally):

While we're were tripping, in her house as well, just being a bit of a self absorbed twat really. He is not someone who makes people feel nice, he always says mean things to bring you down. A negative person. He spat inside on two separate occasions (classy too), So yeah, while on acid, it becomes quite apparent that this guy is a total fucking cunt.  A massive 100% cock-up-his-own-arse wanker of the highest calliber. Doesnt understand the true meaning of LSD at all. Thinks he does which makes it even worse.  Ive been through some crazy times in my life, being mean to people is FUN right!? Especially in their house.). A very unpleasant man indeed. My GF and I are VETERANS at tripping and we see through people very easily. (dealing with jail folk will teach you that).

Imagine being around friends who bring warmth and love and positive vibes. This is how I see my friends and what I want to fill my life with.  This guys presence was dead. Pure ice. No love. No warmth. Not only that

I mean surely you guys can already tell. What a fucking tool. 100% fail. 

But...It gets better.

Of course I was blissfully unaware of this silent and highly complex dominance mind game going on between my friend and my GF until my GF just casually smirked at him and said :

And this was were I almost wept of pride:

""You claim that you want to be our friend yet you have behaved  so incredibly offensive towards me and my home. You SPAT when I asked you a question earlier. You constantly peck at people who are feeling good to make them feel as sad as you feel inside. And im sorry if this puts a damperner on things, are what us civilized people have the misfortune of calling a ""cunt"". (the way she precisely and slowly mouthed out that word was almost as if she were making love to it). 

There was about 10 seconds of ""dead air"" as we call it in the business"". I was on the edge of my seat. Very Tense! He then started putting his shoes on and looked in my GFs eyes

There were no words. The  look of venom I saw in my GFs eyes in that moment was truly Frightening. I've know her for 5 years

She looked him dead in the eyes and very subtly flicked her head towards the front door. Not a word.

He raised his hands. Got his shoes and left quietly.

That shit was so incredibly and randomly arrousing I can't explain it. I dunno

She just chucked a scumbag out of my house with not so much as a subtle flick of her head. 

He may be wandering the streets right now without shoes on with a head full of acid and to be honest

So yeah

You sure do learn a lot from people when you trip with them.

Somewhere around midnight last night I decided to see how I could handle five hits of blotter (my previous best was three and personally I felt ready to take it further). I had previously taken acid about nine or ten times

Anyway

What happened to me during this trip is very difficult for me to explain, it seemed like. I know that sounds insane, but I vividly remember seeing and rewinding the action of my hand petting my cat. I also saw faint traces of what could have been various religious imagery. Pictures of clouds seemed to have ""Satan"" written in them. A collection of markings on the wall resembled the sefirot. The skin on my arms seemed to develop transparent and shadowy tattoos that resembled branches of trees and I felt a strong sensation that some beings were embracing me from both sides of my body. I am not religious, so it was surprising to experience all of this.

When I didn't know what I was, possibly every living thing. Though there was also a slight notion that we are much, much more insignificant than most people think. As if our universe were just a button on a million-button jacket in a giant overstocked warehouse. And, yeah, there were some mystical themes to my trip.

As soon as I started coming up, that somehow sustain each other. I guess the latter and former ideas somewhat connect, but I don't know.

Acid Report
12:11AM- acid taken
1:03AM- currently laying on the tramp. Listening to D.A.N.C.E. by Justice. I'm feeling really good. Body not really functioning. 
1:45AM- in the thick of it now. Just found out John Doe took 3 tabs. He is convulsing on the trampoline. May need help
2:04AM- people drove all the way out here to come support me after I graduated high school. That's a pretty big deal. Life has changed forever. I won't have to see the same people everyday
3:11AM- still tripping balls. Everyone is on separate journey
3:25AM- this night is one for the ages. A journey embarked that's so epic
I can see from like 5 different points of view. It's interesting to be observing this happening while being immersed in it. Is this what hunter s Thompson felt like?
4:12AM- still tripping. Feels like its been forever but it hasn't. Sun rises in 1 or so hours
(That should be intriguing) where did Patrick Star go? Oh wait
Maggie May has some demons that need addressing. She has a lot of soul searching to do. She needs to realize that nobody hates her. We're just worried about her and want the best for her. 
Personal thought: I don't like talking on acid. I enjoy my inner monologue.

Bottom line: the only absolute I deal in is the absolute that nothing is absolute. 

I hear motorcycles racing

........
.........
............

4:35AM- it's only been like 30 mins but I can see a total difference. We're back in control

Or not... The grass is moving beautifully

4:43AM- this has been an eye opening experience for me. I've realized sooooo much about who I am and who I should be. If you don't have anything nice to say
5:02AM- we are all the exact same. We're humans and we need to work together to survive.
Also
We were convinced someone was missing the whole time

Patrick just kept talking about niggah shit. Huh?

5:24AM- we're no where near as tripped out as we were
5:28AM-I just want it to be over

5:38AM- ten mins until the sun rises!!! I'm so excited to see something beautiful!

Here it is unedited








""Yep can't formulate 1 solo idea to share 

seeing things wayyyy to clearly to be able to communicate what I'm thinking beyond it being something you have to feel and not anything that could be represented through words or descriptions. it would be a waste of time to even try to put this all together in a coherent manner in anyway. I don't even know if what im typing is being thought of or if what Im thinking is not a present state. there are no opinions. opinions of things are dumb. To have opinions is…. i'm over opinions. Uncertainty! UNFUCKINGCERTAINTY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. Im so certain of it! Its really not fair to think things other than what us currently presented to you at this very moment. Alex posted this crazy trippy thing of Facebook hop nope nope nile. Leaving this place and going to have an open mind about everything. Approach every new experience like I'm thinking right now. With fresh vibrant eyes. you really need to have a lot of time on your hands to be able to just stop and think don't you? hope its not too late for me. I know its not. only getting older but need to take your time. speed dial rotator. if you look really close at anything it instantly becomes very interesting and creative. Same goes for if you zoom out and look at systems and how they work. things that are bigger than you. which is pretty much everything. The temporary nature of this tripped out amazing daydream colourful feeling state and mindset I'm in

over think it and edit it. every decision you make is a very specific EDIT to what you want people to think of you. but the most important things are the things you feel. Love is what it is i guess. that thing everyone can't stop thinking about for some reason. its something you need to feel and sometimes that doesn't translate well into circumstances and really getting to know people properly. its a real shame things are so superficial almost all the time. i don't feel like i could speak these ideas out of my head. they probably just wouldn't come out right. goes from daylight to total nighttime darkness soo fast. I feel like i need to stare in someones eyes for a few minutes sometimes. really a thing you only do with people you love. probably have only stared a few people in the eyes in my entire life. All people that i love i guess. LOVE not Love'd love is a kind of crazy thing that doesn't have a past tense really. it shouldn't if your doing something right maybe. why are things so hard sometimes and why do i waste time thinking about anything. we all just over think everything. it hilarious. our world is just made up of 7 billion people who over think everything and we don't even realize how good we have it because we spend so much time focusing on what is annoying even though there are a lot of things that are annoying. Such a free flow of ideas unlike anything. you just have to catch as many short insights as you can. its tough to decide whether you should try to bring these back with you or just try to soak it in in hopes that the feeling stays with you forever and it can become your outlook on your whole life. Im getting very anxious that this text file isn't saved.

thats the word. buzzing in your ear to live up to responsibilities and fulfill obligations. k gonna save. As if i spend so much fucking time looking into a fucking metal box of electricity. its fucking absurd. i've probably lost half my life to this metal box. but its also done sooooo many good things for me that its almost worth it. maybe it is. i think I'm typing the words before i even actually process them right now

 I'm always 2 words ahead it seems like. Fuck spelling things right. We need to leave that behind if we want to seek a better future. Basically you need to submit to commerce or you will be outcast from society. I think i can almost definitely say i have no real attachment to material items. I have done without and I have done with and i don't think i need them. Comfort is a different story. Think I'm ready to give that up for a while. I think you can live in the moment more if you do. Hahahahahah just thought about my student loans. oh wait thats just an imaginary number that means nothing oh yeah forgot about that. It is absurd. in this state I can't think of any way in which anybody could intentionally harm another person for any reason. WHY DOES our society operate of the backs of exploited people. the exploited majority. its truly impossible to properly communicate any of these ideas in words. its almost like you just have to look into someones eyes and think about it and maybe that feeling will transfer to them. feeling. feeling. and short term if you just un-filter freeform expression. that's how you can get pure ideas. GO EDIT THIS LATER. fuck it for now

I'll just spew out whatever i can possibly get out now even if its illegible who cares. The words are starting to form funny structures and patterns. The shapes of the paragraphs have a personality to them. If you zoom out and look at it I think thats what good creativity is. expressing an idea where the ego is taken out of an experience. Or in the opposite to were its very very involved superficial and not timeless and can be beautiful  with shitty imperfections. its truly the thing that makes life worth living to its fullest. to seek out as many new experiences and imperfections and details and narrow-minded half opinions that you thought you once had. imagine a language where past or future tense didn't exist? its would be a positive world if that language was put into use. Everything EVERYTHING. at the exact same time. over and over again. repetitive and mantra-istic octaves zooming out geometric shapes and imperfections. these thoughts are just orbiting my head. without any control. Oh man i can't even imagine talking to someone that is strightminded right now. would definitely think I'm crazy. we are told that what is truly sane is crazy. I don't know if i should share this with people or not. i feel like i should but i don't know. who cares what people think. you just have to do whatever. it really takes strong people to be really honest.I really appreciate honesty in people. more than anything right now really. Ha i think Devin is talking to his mom on the phone right now. wonder if thats going weird for him or not. LSD is unbelievably inspiring and thought provoking like nothing else in this entire man made bucket of dirt we live in. Just looking at which words got randomly capitalized in this text document really speaks a lot



even tho it probably shouldn't. are those my most important thoughts maybe? I GUESS. Yeah all the capitalized words seem important. its pretty subconscious i guess. theres a lot going on in the background that we have actually no understanding of. Its crazy how fragile things are. like the tiniest bit of water could destroy this computer. the elements

are what we SHOUD FEAR. THE ELEMENTS. THERE ITS CAPiTOLIZED. Noone ever really says my name very often, its going to microwave my balls and give me cancer. like Duncan. That guy has taught me a lot in podcast form. Has really had an indoctrination effect on me. but in a good way. to be indoctrinated in good ideas is good. Is it? indoctrinarian is not ever good is it. its almost like we have to use this dirty tricks against the system and use them for good. Its crazy how there is always a THEY. THEY. 



IT TAKES TALKING TO YOUR HWHOLE FAMILY ON SPEAKERPHONE TO REALIZE your still fucked add can't coordinate these words into a sentence thats half good. I just want someone to love me before i die i guess. thats about it

1368420513.0,1e87i8,My Daytrip in Central Park,mattneskie,21,2,10," Reflecting on my trip, it was November 17th, I had dropped two tabs of LSD with Taylor on the bus to New York City. It all seemed like a dream

I was surrounded by vibrant orange, fat from getting ready to hibernate for the winter. There was a lily pond surrounded by a large, towering boulder. While walking down to the benches, we all passed squirrels that climbed the fence and looked curiously at us, as I looked just as curiously back to them, because of my current state. We reached the benches and I proceeded to pull out the blunt I had rolled earlier that morning. I casually lit it up as a few people passed. Strangely, they didn’t seem too bothered by the smell of it like I had assumed. As I took my first drag, and the water reflected the shade of green from the foliage around the base of it. Taylor and I were just astonished by the peacefulness of it all. Never have I experienced that much serenity. I was pretty much content just doing that the whole day; it was so beautiful. Then, and mother in a pair of jeans with a suit jacket over. 

First, him smiling and looking happy to be there. The mother stood back filming the moment happen. Then, the daughter stopped in front of a bench where a squirrel was looking for nuts. The father then said, “Do squirrels wear mittens?” “No!” giggled the daughter. He then asked the same question about birds; more laughter ensued by all three of them this time. She then passed us, galloping, which we all thought was adorable beyond belief. She then stopped up ahead to the other hill, looking at another creature in the piles of leaves on the ground. She then resumed her galloping, “Okay

The whole time, the fact that it just seemed so perfect and sweet. It made me realize that I want to be happy and loving when I grow up, and I want a family like that. I want to be a happy father and a good husband with a happy family who lives in a decent city with a great life. I want to have something like that.

I am a writer who dabbles a little in philosophy

Drugs I’ve tried: cannabis, and Adderall. I  did have one negative experience with cannabis. It caused me to once have a brief “flash” of panic that I was able to talk myself out of. For a few days thereafter I suffered from increased anxiety—more the result of me going “I have never had this experience, why me?” and fearing it would happen again—which I rationalized into oblivion after about a week. I eased myself back into cannabis and now have no trouble with it, or Adderall or caffeine for that matter.  

I had sufficiently built up my confidence until I read of the 16 year old girl who suffered a meltdown while on the drug (http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/19y59f/hey_guys_i_really_need_advice_on_legal_troubles/). I have also heard of negative trips, and I have never been suicidal, but then again LSD is said to be one of the most powerful substances known.  I guess I just want to give it its true respect, and start with half a tab on my day off. I think I know all of the ground rules: don’t trip in the dark, don’t trip alone, have good music available, etc. But should I go so far as to remove my firearms (I live in the Midwest USA) from my residence as well? Any chance of me mistaking a gun for a lollipop? Would having my partner take me to the park be a good idea? How well will I know my surroundings? Will I still recognize my neighborhood as such

That said, it will probably be wild, at times scary, and at times fun, but relatively harmless.

1352735164.0,132dzn,Hello r/LSD. This is my LSD story.,kronaa,21,3,18,"I was thinking how to make this as short as possible

The whole thing that got me here was [This.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/130xkt/2_frightening_drawings_that_my_friend_did_on_an/c6zu0hv)
I can now see that my way of taking acid is ofc not the *only way*.

To make long story short, and when his parents saw him he almost ended up in hospital because he was really out of control (scared!). We were in town. It was dark. We was scared and not ready for a really strong trip we took. 2nd friend also went home 2hrs later and left me alone in the middle of the town. I menaged to get home safe and without any problems, but because of what happend with the whole trip and 2 of my friends i could not relax even when i got home, and I live alone. The paranoia just overwhelmed all of us. It felt really bad,like we did something really wrong. I was feeling guilty for providing acid to my friends. I turned on ALL the light in house, and to be really honest, coulden't find anything good in this trip at that point. Everything in house was scary, when it was really clear I am not stable enough to focus and enjoy my trip. It was more like my trip was enjoying *me.* To conclude-nobody died

So here goes trip no. 2.

I re-connected with my old friend that was out of town for a long time. When he got back in town, and what do you know.. He was already tripping for 2 years regularly at that point. By himslef. In the mountains. Its clear that, at this point, i felt really good when i was with him, as he really is good, understanding honest man. He was not pushing me into it at all - it was my idea because all the time I felt there is much more in acid that i got to know. So one day, we packed our bags, chocolate, whatever happens he will be there for me to help me. When acid kicked in, I took my shirt off and just layed there in my shorts on the grass and i felt like I FINNALY understand ""how it all works"". I had some visual distorsions

We are still tripping to this day, ever, had a bad trip since then. Thats was almost 6 years ago. To this day, he is still my best friend and my best LSD companion. It changed me so much, its for a completely different topic. I look at things different, i respect things and people so much more now. It really opens your eyes, in a way that i thought was impossible.

So what exactly is the point of this story? Well its rather simple-I really think when you are stepping in a world of acid, accept it and not be scared of it-it may be rather difficult if you are with wrong people, wrong environment and wrong approach.

**TL;DR:** My first trip was really bad, some may feel a different situation is perfect for them.. But i found that nature in all of its glory will give you the best trip of all times. Respect it.",,False,,t5_2qhvj,False,,

Ok basically, K, Mcat... you name it. THIS WAS A BAD IDEA!

We woke up the next day feeling like death and decided to drop acid as soon as we woke so we had the whole day to trip. We had two tabs each, like we were being reunited for the first time in years. It was awesome! 

We then walked back to the cottage discussing how crazy it was getting and what had happened in our own minds so far. Once we were there we sat on the grass laughing for a while until i asked what time it was

This is where shit started to get really intense. Me and one of my friends went on a long walk up the road from the cottage. It was at this point that we felt like we had known each other for decades and that what was happening was meant to be and almost dejavu like. Once we reached to top of the road we were faced with a massive field that had a huge mountain at the end of it. The sun was behind this mountain and the colours on the field were just beautiful. It was here that i peaked!

I watched the world end and recreate itself in front of me with my friend. The feelings were inexplicable and what i saw was also. I still struggle to put it into words even after a year of discussion but basically i felt like the universe had started a new cycle and i was reliving history again and again and again. I then went into a crazy loop where i would just wander the cottage and the fields around it repeating the words MIND and TIME. These two words had an inexplicable meaning to me and i felt like i had to remember them  to  stay alive (not in a bad way) in a very positive way. 

The next few hours are just a blur and i don't really know what happened. It got to the stage were i was totally in control of the drug and its effects. I could literally pick up an object and morph it into anything i wanted to a certain degree. This was awesome and i spent a lot of time playing with it. I experienced a lot of different visuals round about this time as well. A few of my friends had vines growing up there faces, Then once i blinked they were back to normal. Again this sounds horrible but i had become so used to it that it didn't scare me anymore. I WAS FUCKING LOVING IT! 

The trip ended after about 14 hours and i peaked for about 4 or 5 of this. It was seriously the best day of my life and although this post is insanely long i have still missed out sooooo much. I experienced many common things such as surfaces breathing etc

I recently droppped acid for the first time and it was a life changing experience unlike any other. It was going fine throughout the build up and peak and I was feeling great for some time after the peak as well. During this time I had made ridiculous statements about life and such all the time and felt like I had everything figured out as pink floyd's ""time"" roared through the halls. But alas

That was when it hit me, it's not something we will experience anyway because our brains doesn't function anymore.

This is of course just speculations evn though everything isn't just taken from nowhere. I think one [video!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIJHJzDQcRM&amp;feature=share) that I recently saw had the biggest influence for this ""theory"".

Last summer I took what I think to be a weak / small dose

Just to give a little context of my life:

I've smoked weed, but also because it seemed to have stripped everything I liked about myself: being enthusiastic, analytical, curious. I like my incessant drive to improve myself. 
Smoking those joints every day stripped all of those. I kept thinking about the smoking, about being apathetic, about being bored and not wanting to do anything all day. 

This anxiety was compounded by my health issues. Sometimes it was paralyzing anxiety. Not quite panic attack

About my health, so each time I tried to get off it, I got my digestive cramps back and that, together with the tobacco withdrawal symptoms, kept making me relapse.

So recently, and to try stay off weed (most of my friends smoke, so I decided to make conscious decisions about if I should smoke it, not just give into peer pressure, or to my impulses. And to smoke it rarely). I have smoked weed 3 times since then (pipe), and each time I didn't enjoy the fact that I couldn't quite focus when I was stoned. It reminded my of the anxiety.

Also, part lack of growth. I've started reading again, exercising. I began meditating, and reading a lot about this.

I feel better, but I'm more mindful about them. I still have a long road ahead, and the realisation that I need to pace myself has helped. 

Anyway

The first discouraging read I found was this: http://www.messagefrommasters.com/Therapy/LSD-an-Help-in-Meditation.htm

The second is this: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/kbm70/has_anyone_had_lsd_induced_problems/

What happened afterwards was the single most mind bending/ amazing experience I've ever had!

 As I kept inhaling the balloon, the piece of wood, or whatever it is that hits the bell, got  higher the more I inhaled and exhaled into the balloon.. and I suddenly had the wonderful/awful realization that If it got to the top, and the bell rang, then ""something"" would happen, me being the adventurous type, and rode it to the top.

 I never actually remember hearing the bell ring, i was actually shooting upwards away from the campsite, and I could see myself lay on my back with my feet sticking out the tent, as well as my group of friends also sat around the campsite, I then realised that I could either choose to go back down, or shoot on up the way and see where I was going.. but either myself, or another entity, then There would be no coming back.. I didn't really know what to do and was pretty damn scared, and they, and I at some point apparently just fell onto my back in my tent

 I have since experienced Out of Body Experiences while being completely sober, and the feeling of an out of body experience scare me sometimes.. I often wonder if in fact, that exact combination of chemicals in my brain at the time, opened me up to that sort of an experience in sober life? And whether or not the experience I had, might have actually been a point in my life where I could have died.. but I somehow made it back? 

Just wondering if anyone here has any thoughts on this? Or similar experiences? Sorry for the wall of text :)

Went to a festival, did nitrous, had crazy out of body/ near death experience,  that ended up being extremely similar to later OBE experiences in sober life!  ",,False,,False,t3_15n30j

At about 3 hours in, I saw insane brightly colored spiraling geometric fractals that looked to be a thousand miles across. Her room resembled a living, breathing, dormant biomass that was constantly changing from a geometric plane to a very organic and psychedelic space.
Heres where things get interesting. We lay next to eachother, and could tell that something was about to happen. I got the urge out of no where, and decided to tell her 'telepathy is real' . She looks at me sort of oddly, smiles, and puts her head back down. I dont exactly know what the first things we communicated were, but I remember knowing exactly what she was thinking without talking to her, and I could clearly communicate messages to her by melding my conscience with hers
After a while of basking in disbelief and attempting to get our minds to realize that what happened was indeed real, looked her in the eye, and told her I love her too. She was almost completely astonished and bewildered at my ability to read her mental message. We continued to do this back and forth for roughly 4 hours, each message being more complex and unbelievable than the last.. Although I cannot quite remember many of the other ways we tested out our new.. 'ability' for lack of a better term. It was a beautiful experience to say the least, I never ever would have thought something like that would be possible. Its simply incredible.
It was her first time ever doing a psychedelic

So my friends and I have planned to drop acid all together for a while now, for you non Canadians, we decided to venture out into a big forest/creek in our area. I personally dropped 3 tabs, while my other friends dropped 1 or 2. We dropped on the way to the forest, so as soon as we got off the trails into the actual forest, we were already feeling the first effects. While aimlessly walking and staring at things, we stumbled upon a rope swing, with a 10m drop on the other side. We all took turns going around the tree with the swing and it was easily one of the highlights of the trip. After, we just sounded like tone deaf pigs. This was also around the point when I began seriously peaking. All the trees and bushes became wrapped in a very colourful pattern which resembled symbols and runes. I tried to find pictures to exemplify what I saw, and ended up sitting on a log. I put my headphones on and listened to Sigur Ros' - ""Glosoli"" 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz8iEJeh26E

While listening to the song
Without even paying much attention, towards the build up of the song, I was able to conclude that I'm very content with who and where I am. As the song climaxed after the buildup, I felt as if i was overtaken by intense happiness and joy, unlike any I've ever felt before. As I looked up to the sky, I felt so grateful for everything in my life and became truly amazed of the beauty of music and nature. I seriously don't remember when was the last time I was that happy and content with everything. After spending 4 hours aimlessly walking around and getting lost at every turn, we decided to leave the forest. Since it was already getting dark, I decided to turn my head around and see if all my friends were still with us. As I turned my head back, became slightly less colourful and vibrant. This similar twitch kept occurring a few times for the next 30 minutes, before we all decided to go home. 

Overall it was my most fun and interesting Canada Day thus far

1370100911.0,1fgtph,"First trip, wow.",lucydthrowaway,20,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/1fgtph/first_trip_wow/

I thought I was going on a pretty typical camping trip with a few friends (names obviously changed): Michelle, ex-boyfriend high school senior. Ricky had a nice old camper way up in the woods, so secluded it was only accessible by a 10-15 minute Wrangler ride. The first few hours were pretty uneventful; watched Justin get super drunk, went fishing and cooked catfish over the open flame, danced half-naked in the dark, fun stuff.

After it was good and dark, haven't done that in a while! He and I passed the joint back and forth, and Michelle took a couple hits as well, but it's not really her thing. Pretty soon, we put out the fire and moved into the camper to chill. Justin took up residence on one mattress and promptly passed out, while the other three of us squeezed onto the other and waited to feel the buzz. For me, it never actually came (I suspect he had some bunk stuff). And then, and grabbed a tab from him with enthusiasm, ""You'll be fine, considering I'm 90 pounds and tend to be a lightweight when it comes to anything.

Tab goes in my mouth and it tastes a little acidic (no pun intended), waiting for it to kick in. I kind of forgot I even did it.

A little while later, *look*!"" Both of them sat up and noticed it, too. I touched my face and noted that it felt super weird, and kind of numb. I quickly started feeling a little...off. My stomach was numb, but I could feel that telltale nauseous feeling, but there's nothing I hate in the world more than throwing up, so I tried to fight off the feeling. Ricky found the brown paper bag that was our garbage bag, and handed it to me. I clutched onto it and held it up to my face

Then, the door was open and I was on my hands and knees, puking like I was exorcising a demon. Suddenly, there were hands rubbing my back and holding my hair back. At this point, my entire body was numb. When you throw up, it's the most awful feeling in the entire world and you feel that burning in every cell of your body for hours. I felt nothing. I simply saw the puke come out. Suddenly, how the fuck did I get there?! Did I just teleport?! The feeling of time shifting around like that is indescribable with English words. It gave me a sort of sick vertigo that felt ominous. When I snapped back into reality, instilling a terror in me. ""Is that blood?"" seemed like the right thing to ask. Ricky insisted it wasn't, I was suddenly on the mattress again.

This tripped me out hard and apparently I kept asking the same thing over and over again, the trip was *on*. For all of us. (Except Justin, who was still passed out.) We sat in a circle staring at all of our hands and laughing at them. In less time than a split second, the three of us turned into beams of color, and traveled across the universe for thousands of years, and then came to rest in the camper. I felt an intense bond with them that ran incredibly deep after that moment, and tried to explain what had just happened

That feeling when you're about to fall asleep and jerk back awake? I seemed to feel that every couple of minutes. The walls dripped and air flowed with color. I would watch this with amazement, existing in the place where my body was at that point in time. I couldn't feel *anything*. At this point, because I felt like I was far from physical, I had no control over my voice. My voice and thoughts were two very separate things. I observed myself talking like I was a separate being, though I hardly knew I was saying anything. I just kept rambling on. From this point on, I probably could have written some song lyrics better than the Beatles.

Justin hears this commotion and sits up a bit, in fact, done that. I was *so* excited that he was here now, and awake! He could join in our journey! I replied, ""JUSTIN! Justin! We did LSDdddddd..."" and that's all I could consciously control before it turned into some dribble like ""Oh god and it's like I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming and then I'm over there and then here and then I'm dreaming over there again and I'm dreaming but I'm not dreaming because I'm here but I'm not here because I'm dreaming and hi Justin, is this real? Am I dreaming this? Or is this dreaming me? Help, I love you."" He stared at me blankly before bursting into laughter.

He talked to us for a while and got caught up with what had happened. Michelle looked like a crack addict on withdrawal and was shaking and couldn't speak full words. She would pull at her neck and scream ""There's so much... SKIIIN!"", then as long as that bottle of vodka existed in front of me, then I could drink the entire thing without consciously doing it, and I would die. ""JUSTIN PUT THAT AWAY RIGHT NOW. PLEASE. I DON'T WANNA DIE, PLEASE DON'T LET ME DIE..."" he tried to talk me through it but I wasn't that logical obviously. Soon, though, the best thought ever hit my illogical brain - Justin isn't tripping, I completely relaxed and let the acid have its way with me

We had Ricky's phone playing on shuffle, making them sound like they were chewed up, digested, and spat back out in my face. Eminem played, and I could see the song when I closed my eyes.

I came down off the peak after that, just trying to look out for everyone. Everything was funny, but I had no real control over my laugh and it came out odd every time. It was an effortless and beautiful laugh, though, and I felt that euphoric feeling in my head like it was disconnected from the actual laugh. Everything was beautiful and I loved everything and everyone. I tried to explain to everyone how the everything was interconnected and there are no coincidences; how we are the in the Universe but the Universe is also inside of us; how everything will always be okay in the end. They all wrote it off as babbling, but I felt like it was all of dire importance that I tell everyone these things.

Justin and Ricky decided to interview me to see what I would say
""Who is the president of the United States?""
""Barack Obama.""
""Good! Who was the president before Barack Obama?""
""William Schaffer. ... ... Wait. Who's William Schaffer?"" (I still have no idea.)
""hehe lol haha""
""ASK ME ANYTHING I AM YOUR ORACLE""
""Okay. What do I need to do in life?""
""Justin...come on. I'm not your oracle just because I did LSD. You need to find that inside yourself!""

...etc. It was fun to play around with my logic. :P 

After that, as I was starting to come down but she was still struggling to really even talk. We all decided she shouldn't do it again. Six hours later, she was still unable to come back into reality. However, after a bit of sleep, she told me the next day that it was the most incredible experience of her life. I think we were all changed by the experience significantly.

That was long, I definitely wasn't quite prepared for the way LSD just shot me like a cannon out of my entire existence. I can only imagine what a full tab or more will do to me, but it definitely wasn't my last time.

I have a question I would love to ask of other users

I have been enjoying LSD for 28 years and when I was a teenager we always tripped on Friday night and go out and party. 

When I was in my twenties and thirties I would trip at concerts and festivals or at home.

Now I am in my forties I trip for spiritual reasons. I meditate and try to induce altered states of consciousness.  

Now that I am older I feel compelled to trip with purpose and not just to get fucked up. I kinda feel like I have to have a special occasion to take the acid and just party with friends or go out to do something

Oneof my favorite activities while trippin: Video games! Either stand up arcade style or Team Fortress or BF2 they are awesome. Not to mention how well I play when I am on LSD. For those who game I ended one BF2 round 189/3 and I was rushing the other team the whole round.

If my wife is willing sex is unbelievable. Walking around in nature and cloud watching. The sky and nature become their own screen saver when you are trippin.

Thanks to a trip that I experienced 3 days ago, amanita, psilocybin, DXM, MDMA, etc… We had all tripped multiple times together with no issues, but for some reason things took a horribly negative turn this night. 

	My two friends (who I will call N and D) decided to come up from our hometown to stay in my new apartment in Asheville for the night and reminisce. Not long ago someone had given me a new acid connection and claimed that it was very very strong. I remembered that N and D both had mentioned wanting to try LSD so I called them up and set the plan in motion. We decided on a 10 strip which was the low low price of 60 dollars. Around 9 o' clock we left to pick up the strip. I walked into the house and paid the man. I was then presented with 10 sour patch kids which had just been prepared with LSD a few minutes ago. I knew that it was going to be intense

	The apartment was empty

T+30 10:30. Definitely beginning to feel it. We were all shaking, it was over and he was totally fine. We all laid on my bed and talked about our time in high school. Overall the trip was already more intense than anything that I had experienced before. 

T+1:00 11:00. The bedroom was nice

T+2:00 12:00. Something is wrong with N. He is constantly getting up and sitting down, hoping that N will get over this hump and start enjoying the trip again. 

T+2:30 12:30. I look over at N and realize that he is masturbating on my couch. Something was NOT right. He had this smile on his face that just screamed ""Nothing is wrong

T+3:00 1:00. All night long N would make advances on D and I and randomly masturbate. His pants just seemed to keep coming off. At one point he even jumped up and grabbed my crotch. I had to physically push him away from me and tell him that what he was doing was not right. This is the point that he ""broke"". Right after all this he began to repeat the same things over and over with no real meaning. he said things like ""It was such a great time"" ""It was the worst dream ever"" ""So whats up? Where are we going?"" ""Its all word"" and he would just repeat those things over and over in different orders. 

T+4:00 2:00. N is starting to make remarks like ""A is going to kill himself!"" at the top of his lungs. During this time he also said things like ""I've just got to go see my mom

T+5:00 3:00. Goddamn it he is smoking in my apt and ashing everywhere. D hides his cigarettes. N starts to mumble that he isn't gay over and over. He makes multiple homosexual slurs

T+6:00 4:00. N still has no clue that he has done anything. The remarks that someone is going to kill themselves became much more intense at this point. Eventually he starts to mumble that we are all one person and starts to hold his breath. Not good. He eventually starts breathing again and pees his pants all over my couch. While tripping

T+7:00 5:00. N is obviously tired and trying to go to sleep (Which he had been talking about doing all night) on our couch. He keeps trying to lie on his face

T+7:15 5:15. N wakes up and looks horrified. He is back in reality but still tripping a little bit. He asks us what happened last night and we tell him. He is obviously shocked at it. He goes back to sleep and D and I try to explain what happened to each other. 

Aftermath: I saw a broken human that night and it has forever changed how I view LSD. If any of my roommates had come home early my friend would be in a hospital without a doubt. LSD can be an amazingly enlightening experience, I had to physically restrain my best friend from molesting me and killing himself. That is nothing that a human should have to experience while experiencing the most intense trip of his life. That is all. Peace",,False,,t5_2qhvj,False,,

They'll be an image I'm looking at, or a rug, or something, and my brain will find reference ""points"", some sort of intersection or outcropping, and from that point will spring a flowing Mandelbrot set, but the set won't be solitary

I tripped with my girlfriend. We took a tab at about 3PM, took in the architecture and the nature, and had a blast feeding the koi fish and touching them. As the peak was coming, we went to the restaurant within the gardens and had *the best goddammned cup of tea ever*. As it was getting dark and we were peaking, we went to the Planetary (a small sort of space museum thing). We got there at 7 PM and attended the Planetary's show. That was INTENSE. They sit you in a circular auditorium beneath the dome and project a pseudo-3D documentary of the roof of the dome itself. AMAZING STUFF. We were both clutching hands and marvelling at how intense the documentary was. Seeing the stars, nebulae and other celstial bodies projected on a huge dome above us really blew our minds.

This time, and none of us felt or saw the same sort of things as the first time (which was the first for all of us).  As we were coming down, one of us had the idea to smoke some marijuana.  I had never smoked before, and as such was fairly nervous (although I had thought I had completely sobered up from the LSD).  We all went down to someone else's room to smoke, and I only took one hit, but everything went downhill from there.  

I didn't really feel bad yet, only slightly at first but stronger than ever soon enough.  My first reaction was to warn my friends what was going on, and that even if we felt sober the acid was still in our bodies.  I could not express this in words, however, no matter how hard I tried, and everyone else just acted normal.  Huge pains started searing through my body, however

The walk upstairs was one of the strangest and scariest moments of my life.  Ever step I took, in a similar fashion to strong bright colors one expects to see on LSD, if that makes any sense.  It was at this point that I first realized that I was experiencing a bad trip.  Everything around me seemed to speed up, and I felt like I was hugging on to my friend for dear life.  The strangest part is, in actuality I was walking fairly normally, when I felt like I was going insane.  I occasionally had ""dark"" thoughts, and felt very cold.  It is extremely hard for me to describe exactly what I felt; just that it was probably the worst experience in my life.  Once we finally reached the room, but I was still freaking out for at least 3 more hours.  I felt like I was acting extremely strangely and had no idea and no control over what was going on with my body.  I repeatedly asked whether or not my friends thought I was crazy and if I was acting strangely

When a sober friend I called to come help me finally came and talked to me, you are fine.  When I knew that inside my body I felt absolutely horrible and my mind was racing and thinking indescribable things, this is not what you want to hear.  I knew I was acting very strangely, but no one would agree with me.  When my sober friend talked to me and agreed with others that to an outsider I may seem fine but drugs were fucking with my mind, all I did was try and outlast the drug until I could be sober again.

Even though I understood that my feeling of craziness was self-induced

I am writing this post for two reasons.  First of all, LSD is a drug that fucks with your mind.  You must be in a good mental state if you want to have a good trip.  If you are nervous at all, DO NOT use the drug.  It will not end well.  I fucking knew perfectly well that I was acting completely insane, and there was absolutely nothing I could do about it.  It is not a fun feeling.

Second of all, much as like one cannot describe certain good aspects of LSD to someone unless they too have taken it.  I know I had a bad trip, and it was the worst experience of my life.  It is really fucking scary to know that my brain is capable of doing such things that I never would have expected from someone not in a mental institution.  I really would like to talk to someone who had a similar experience, as I wonder how this will change my life in the future and whether or not there will be any permanent damage.

My understanding is this means that all the crazy hallucinatory stuff happens from you losing perception of external sensory, why the TV shows and movies? Wouldn't that lessen the trip? Sounds boring to me!

One time I was browsing this forum called DreamViews.com. Maybe you've heard of it if you're a lucid dreamer. There was this guy who talked about how one day he decided to try something new with lucid dreaming. He decided to become lucid, all the people who gave it a try came back supporting his findings) Why? Because once he decided to sit down and quiet himself, he left the closedminded, boring normalcy of the first person perspective and of being grounded in this body. 

A trip is all about getting outside of your head, maybe I'm naive and thinking of all psychedelics as the same and if that's the case go ahead and tell me that.

But first, hence wanting to do it again after every time. The fourth time around though, I had the mysteries of the universe unravel before my own eyes, clearer than I could have ever expected it. It changed my worldview and answered most of my questions. In no specific order, here are my revelations that I managed to write down:

The human mind does have its limitations and we have trouble comprehending several concepts: infinity, there was no beginning, simple as that. I don't think the mind IS the universe but that it simply evolved enough to be able to perceive and comprehend some of it around us. The potential for human knowledge is finite due to our mental limitations, therefore there are questions that will never be answered and I'm fine with it. Such as how can anything exist? What exactly happens at the singularity? I believe the universe is NOT fully deterministic because freedom of choice exists and because at microscopic scale true randomness exists. It also became evident that there is another ""force"" in nature that drives all things that are conscious and is essential to their existence. Some call it God, I choose to call it ""love"". It comes into play where intelligent life begins. We have but one life to live, so better make the most out of it. The purpose of life boils down to pure, unconditional love: spreading it and creating life yourself. Giving yourself completely to another person. I had the strongest awareness of the hivemind and a strong sense that somewhere out there someone was reaching out for me like I was reaching out for them, perfectly complimenting each other

Quick background info: 
I don't smoke much (well, which was just once.

Time of smoking after dosing:

- 1st trip: +4 hours (1 1/2 tabs)

- 2nd trip: +6-7 hours (1 tab)

- 3rd trip: +8-9 hours (half a tab)

As you can see my dosages aren't very high

The period of time before I smoke there is not much happening at all. On my 2nd trip I noticed the clouds ""breathing"" a bit and moving wisp-ily. After smoking...HOLY BALLS. On my 3rd trip I just had a very slight generic uplifted

1343381350.0,x8nzh,Finally experienced the bad trip.,Jackadope,24,6,13,"I took a hit of liquid (this being the strongest acid i've ever come across)

I have never once experienced anything less than amazing with LSD, and no one had any trouble.  I experienced many disturbing visual and aural hallucinations.  Once peaking I was finding it difficult to see clearly, and in a last ditch effort to control myself I began looking for a stash of benzos.  Medicine cabinet being empty, I began to get sick.  Sick from the migraine and sick with fear.  I was staring down the barrel of insanity and lucy was about to pull the trigger.

A mixture of terrible anxiety and nausea caused me to vomit several times, and laid down in bed to wait.  I felt neurotic, sickly, and was very afraid of the acid.  The walls that typically breathe and dance bulged and throbbed.  Hawkwind sounded horrible and abrasive.  I did my best not to fight it but I kept finding myself pacing around the room. By the time she arrived I could no longer tell the difference between my eyes being open or closed.  The geometric patterns and lights were all I could see.  

She turned out the lights and laid next to me in bed.  We have tripped together and I found her to be incredibly comforting. She fell asleep and I continued to trip.  This lasted from 3am until the brightness of the mid-morning sun finally crept into my cave.  I as a person became irrelevant, I began to realize the importance of the event.  Of course the LSD had nothing to with the negativity I experienced. And to become more aware of internal anger and anxiety, and the power it has over my life is very important.

The greatest fear I have yet known was sitting on the edge of my bed trying to light a cigarette.  At the same time I was sitting in a chair next to the bedroom door, two different parts represented physically and not able to work together was terrifying.  I knew I had to figure out which of us was real, because when the trip was over one of us was going to disappear.  I feel like the separation of persons may have occurred by mixing two types of LSD though I know no science to back this up.  Several times throughout the night I found myself watching what I was doing across the room.  I enjoy meditation while on LSD, focusing on the experience makes it more powerful and insightful.  Yet this time everything I tried to ignore became more powerful.  I couldn't embrace it because it felt wrong, dark and dangerous.  And this cycle led me further into a temporary psychosis.  It is very possible that in an attempt to dose directly from the vial I took a larger dose than I meant to.

TLDR?  Took two hits, good experience.

I was planning on using it tomorrow night, however, live alone in a studio apartment. Some details to help

* The place is relatively small
* It is very clean and organized
* I have access to a computer with 2 screens
* I have a 28"" LCD TV hooked up to Netflix via my XBOX
* I have a small sofa that I can sit
* I have a twin size bed that faces both the TV and computer monitors
* I plan on getting some Hawaiian BBQ to save for my acid munchies later that night

Does it seem like I will have a good trip based on the situation above? I did not have any weird experiences last night that caused me to panic or anything

I now realize how much bad acid I have had in my life. All the tabs that taste bitter; all the poorly drawn prints; all the uncomfortably wavey trips I've had

I went to a festival and as usual all sorts of drug dealers came around selling their goods. There were subtle but noticeable signs that their acid was bunk (2c's or something of the sort) -- some had shifty eyes and poor rapport that made it clear that profits were their only motive. Some were even honest and told us their tabs were not LSD.

I uncharacteristically showed some restraint and held out. Then a young guy came around, in his own way, let us know it was family acid. He had an earnest tone about him that was obviously not bullshit.

The come up was smooth as can be. All I could do was smile for hours

I can't describe it any other way than pure love. I grew so much closer to the people I was with and I already have strong nostalgic sentiments about the trip.

Well the shtuff really kicked in strong right as we came across some rednecks with chainsaws and axes cutting a bunch of firewood (illegally). We started to get a little paranoid

Then things started to get realllllly weird. We were all having a case of ""word soup."" I have only read about this occuring from crazy huge doses of L or from legitimate mental disorders.

We got back to the car like 6 hours after dropping

Finally we made it out okay and I was fine with the experience after it was gone. I knew bad trips were a thing and I still learned from the journey and had a great time before and after things went sour.

Fast forward a month and a half... I drop again with one of those friends and another friend. Again

Then my friend (the one from the time before) says something's bugging him and gets a little scared. That was all it took to start my downward spiral and soon we were both having a bad trip again

Both times

Now it's been several months, I get scared of having another bad trip. And I know that if I had no fear of a bad trip, I probably wouldn't have one, but I still can't shake it. (Fear of going into a bad trip was the sole reason I had a bad trip the second time).

I watched as he took one tab of LSD and observed him for about four hours, as it takes around two hours for the drug to settle in. After a little bit of convincing, he gave me a tab. Without hesitation I threw it in my mouth and sucked on it as instructed for about 7 minutes before swallowing it. I didn't feel anything for about an hour and a half and I grew impatient. My friend took another tab, and offered me another as well. About five minutes after taking the second tab I stopped playing the impossible game, and glanced up at my ceiling, where my eyes stayed locked for about twenty minutes while I played the impossible game on my ceiling. After telling myself that this was impossible, I looked around. My room seemed smaller, and textures popped. I had a glued-together-puzzle on my wall

Considering the stage of my life at the time, I had lost one my favorite aunts, and for about two weeks before this I was contemplating suicide. About forty minutes after playing with the puzzle, I was leaning, almost laying back in my computer chair. I set a water bottle on my head, because I was enjoying the coolness from it. After a few moments I had an out of body experience, where I stood over my body, but I decided that I needed to let the drug do what it was meant to do, by my family and friends. And lastly I realized that I was only going to be as happy as I made myself

After that night, I no longer take all the things in this world for granted. LSD has close to made me a hippie, I look around the world and see beautiful things, great things, that almost everyone in the world just sees past, takes for granted. Almost every night I sit outside and look at the sky, thinking about life, and I feel that it is a much better way. 

For those that are contemplating doing LSD, DMT, or any other psychedelic drug there is only so much advice to be given. 

First of all

Secondly, I don't suggest doing it at home in your room with your mom in the room over, until you build somewhat of a tolerance to the drug, and you can control yourself well enough to act like you are not tripping. (yes that is very easily possible) An example of a safe environment would be your friend-who-lives-alone-house, or your friends house with their parents gone. If you are highly worried about your first experience, I suggest a baby sitter, someone who has tripped enough to be alright whilst tripping

Third, it will only make you panic. Don't do it. Also, don't try to sleep, it won't work. (""it's a bit hard to sleep with these walls melting"" -First time user friend) I've only ever seen one person able to sleep while tripping, and it was because of the extremely large 
quantity of marijuana he smoked so he could sleep. 

Though there is only so much advice to be given

After the first time I decided that no other drug would ever compare to how great my first LSD trip was. I however since then have tried a few. I have smoked marijuana and JWH which is a chemical that gives the same high as marijuana

I have also tried mushrooms far more times than once, so you won't be seeing things that are not there. (for example, sorry, but you won't be talking to smurfs while on shrooms) All of my experiences have led me to conclude that shrooms simply enhance textures, and colors. Shrooms also give you a body high, that makes you feel.. somewhat like you are made of jelly. Also, your emotions are enhanced. For example if you watch movies or shows, for example

I have also tried DOI, and once it starts it gets more and more intense for about 12 hours. Once at 12 hours it levels out, and stays at that intensity for anywhere from another 8 hours, to another 18 hours, as it lasts anywhere from 20-30 hours. DMT on the other hand is a naturally occurring chemical in your brain. It is released when you sleep, when you die, and when you are born. It is the chemical that causes you to dream, and what helps you learn when you are first born. When you smoke DMT, that I recommend watching if you are interested

As for LSD and Acid trips, and many emotions. Such as love, and peace. It has given me a whole new outlook on religion, friendship, and family. And I can honestly say that I no longer take things for granted. Things that people see and just look past. Things like the sky, weather, trees and flowers, couples, and other forms of entertainment. 


TL;DR = During an LSD trip I realized that I was being foolish and didn't want too commit suicide. From psychedelic drugs I have a new outlook on many things in the world

So

For me, was to simply say ""I'm just as confused as you are!"". Obviously, saying this would only be appropriate if the person he was spectating actually had any ill intent what so ever as far as getting us in any sort of trouble was concerned. It occurred to me that my friend was probably just bugging and that it was probably just a person going to and from there car from their house to get something, and that a complete stranger in the dark shouting ""I'M JUST AS CONFUSED AS YOU ARE!!!"" at 3AM would probably be a huge ""wtf"" moment for someone who just forgot to bring in left over take out from his car.

My first trip

The second happened slightly later in the day. I was on the grass looking at this one patch of dirt were there was some dead grass. I put my hand on it because it looked like it was breathing and when I picked my hand back up, grass growing out of the dirt and getting greener before my eyes, and I saw that same grass die and become a regular patch of dirt. It was at that moment that I felt like I had just traveled forward in time and even though I didn't actually see anything significant, I had a lot of incredible revelations because of that experience.

Another example happened on my second trip. I was on this path in the woods and I was tired from walking so I sat down on the ground. I put my hands on the dirt and shut my eyes. I listened to all the sounds around me, squirrels running around, and I felt like I was able to control the sounds somehow. In my head I was imagining something like a turntable and I could adjust the volume of each individual sound. No clue how long I sat there doing that but at some point it felt like it was too much so I got up and kept walking.

We Droped the Shiva imaged  blotter around 4:30-5:30 in the afternoon in my friends driveway and made our way to the beach. A quick fffffttttt of a bowl and oh how the sun was coming through the trees. So much green! We got to the beach and Lake Michigan had some nice small white caps that day. We began throwing a frisbee around and went for a quick swim. I remember looking around and I started feeling very sluggish

I looked at my phone to get a sense of time, why is this number so significant? Oh well""

And that is the last thing I remember being ""normal""

The sun was starting to set and my friends decided to go for a swim but I stayed on the beach seeing as it was a bit chilly. I began to worry about them because the waves looked like they had grown to a massive size

We left the beach and went back to my friends house

Fast forward to my friends wanting to get some beer. I tagged along for a nice car ride to the local Mini Mart. My buddy who was driving and not tripping looked back at us and said ""Ok just get what you need and get out"" So we went in and I looked at everything up and down the isles, I thought I was going to be sick. We noticed some girls in the car next to us saw us laughing and we just kept laughing harder.

We made it back to my friends house safe and sound! Score

We ended up smoking some bowls outside and just watching the clouds turn into vampire skulls and halos around the moon

everything started out fine and dandy. i dropped with someone i'm very close with, but i'm kind of introverted and shy, so i felt awkward tripping in his presence.

i started withdrawing myself from my two friends, but i felt like i was trying to grasp thin air. as if i was a ghost, and could just put my arm through my body without feeling anything. i tried to cuddle with my friend, but he also felt like a ghost to me. i couldn't hold on to him. imagine cuddling with a hologram when you want nothing more than the comfort of another person's warmth and touch. frustrating and scary as hell.

i felt dead inside. completely empty and emotionless. if i knew what dying felt like

i also saw my friend turn into a faun-like creature (think ""pan's labyrinth""), and in my mind, he was evil and everything he said was a lie. i saw a lot of tortured, screaming faces in the walls and floors, and felt evil entities and just... bad thoughts. 

i cried for days afterwards, and had an amazing, beautiful trip. i guess i just didn't feel comfortable, which manifested into a living nightmare.

1330446058.0,q9tgz,Trip report. Tripped acid for first time yesterday.,Apokalips,18,4,49,"I was doing some live updating yesterday but I decided to do a trip report after I've tripped my balls off.

Man

I went back to my friends house for a little bit, everything was making me laugh. My peak began after we ate in his car and began to drive around. We were listening to The Dark Side of The Moon by The Flaming Lips and it was absolutely wonderful. I cried a little bit and was feeling really amazing energies. I remember passing 2 churches with signs out front that said ""It only gets better"" and ""be kind, be wise, and be humble"". Seeing those made me feel really good about life and the trip, and it excited me for the next hit I was planning on taking...

When we got back to my place is when everything changed. For a few hours before I had this odd feeling in my head, (smoked almost a gram withing a few hours) which I didnt think would be a big deal. I took my second hit and just sat in my room with music playing. I felt like.. nothing. Didn't want to move, and couldn't really talk, just sitting and staring.

My headache was getting so much worse so I took a shower, only almost if that makes sense. My breathing was holding me back, like I would be going further and further and then forget I had to breathe, and it would reset all over again when I took a breath.

I feel like I a wasted a hit, but all in all I still had a great time. Just upset I couldn't go further. I had mild visuals, but it was not as intense as shrooms ever was. I saw a couple ""waves"" in reality and colors were slightly better but that was it.

Anyway sorry if this was long. I'm going for a run and then I'm gonna try to meditate. I would like to thank all you for helping me out yesterday

1317952667.0,l3oir,My Adventure to the Beyond and Back,captain56,16,1,17,"To preface this, the importance of friends

I had dropped acid twice before, let’s call them Fred and George.

This time we had gotten it from a new source.  We planned to take it a Fred and George’s apartment
By the time it was my turn I was feeling the acid very strongly.  The shower they had was amazing, warm, and embracing.  And although part of my mind still recognized that there was a world outside, there was another part that said this wonderful water world was more real.  My thought recursed inwards again and again, as the enclosed shower became almost a sensory deprivation box where all that existed were my thoughts.  After hours (read 15 mins) I worked up the courage to leave this world behind, and reenter the world of other minds.  Putting on my clothes was very difficult.  When I exited I found that my friends were feeling it very strongly as well.

This is where my memory starts to become a little hazy.  But suffice to say it soon became clear that it was affecting me much more than everyone else and even they were caught off guard by how strong the acid was, and was not entirely convinced that they existed if they were not present.  

This folds into the next idea that became lodged in my head.  Taken from the mindset from when I was the lone mind in the water world, making us whole.  

This is where reality really started breaking down for me.  It was not an external break down, I came to realize the absurdity reality and of my existence.  I wake up, go to classes, eat, do some activities, go to sleep, and repeat.  This was taken for granted as normal, more than anything else it did, fall asleep


The next hours were a blur; I remember moving to another house, being in a grocery store, interacting with strange people.

My friends fill me in on details and slowly I learn that these dreams were not dreams

This is where I have to say how awesome my friends were.  Even though Fred and George were also both tripping hard
As I was coming back down into reality we went back to my place to end this adventure of a day by watching Mad Max.

Although parts were terrifying, and more importantly 2. Be with people that you truly trust.

I have since taken a half tab of acid, it seems as if the gates to hell had already been opened by my previous journey and appear as if they may remain open forever.  The amount was small but I felt myself returning to that state of existential angst.  I was able to consciously pull myself out of it, after a long harrowing period of time(read 20 mins).  In this period I made many notes to myself never to take acid again.  After I came mostly down from the small dose I actually watched Being John Malcovich for the first time with a roommate, which needless to say was a very interesting time to watch that movie.

TLDR: So the long and short of it; I accidentally took too much acid, and the experience is one I certainly do not regret now. (I am actually studying currently for my PhD in a cognitive science related field).

1373978684.0,1ierd2,"Intense nausea, vomiting, ego death on 300ug",whymejerseycow,14,16

July 13th was my fourth time dropping acid. The three times before would have never prepared me for what I was about to experience that night.

My first time dropping was in April. I had bought three tabs of 200ug/tab ""white"" acid from my friend, but since it was my first time and I was alone, I slowly segued into a bit of a bad trip which my brother helped me out of. It was good overall.

My second time was four days after that, and it was an excellent trip, a great night.

A while after that my friend bought a batch of 150ug/tab ""yellow"" Gandalf acid from jerseycow on the SR. I bought two tabs and decided to drop with my girlfriend near the end of June, but I was very wrong. We had a great time when it hit, we were both totally relaxed and happy- but when I peaked I start feeling really hot, my heart rate jumped, I started sweating beads, I vomited everything out of my system and emptied my bowels. I felt as if my body was being wringed and it was a horrible, nightmarish trip but I slowly got out of it and was able to walk outside and have a great time after I relaxed and had some water. Although this was my girlfriend's first time ever dropping, and even though the guy who gave her the acid was vomiting from ingesting it, or just a result of anxiety (girlfriend and all) or dehydration since the day was very hot.

A couple weeks pass and my friend only has 4 tabs left. He proposes that I spend the night at his place and drop two tabs along with him. Since I was able to handle 400ug before and because I felt as if I could definitely handle myself now after learning from the bad experience I had with my girlfriend

We got up and he told me that we had to go outside at least one point during the trip. I wholeheartedly agreed (in my head, and I could tell that he was having a bit of trouble figuring out where things were. I myself had total short term memory loss at that point. I could not remember why I got up, I could not remember where were going, how much time had passed, and I kept asking the same questions over and over again. This was definitely because of the weed. He was having massive difficulty communicating with me due to the ambiguous nature of my questions combined with his current high. I finally got a bit of a grasp of what was going on and was able to go outside, into his back yard along with him. I remember it being VERY hot and quite dark. I was wearing a tank top and pajama pants over boxer briefs. It was around 80 fahrenheit (27 celsius) outside. He had a jungle gym and I just climbed up the jungle gym, sat on a platform, feeling very nauseous. The short term memory loss proceeded to hit me VERY hard again and this time the visuals went crazy. Everything shrunk and expanded rapidly and there were fractals EVERYWHERE and I had trouble remembering who my friend was. He approached me and with an oscillating voice said ""Yeah, trying to understand what was going on. The room was expanding and flashing and I was hearing voices and my teeth felt like they were going to break, and I had only eaten three Oreos and half a bottle of water since I got to his place... I distinctly recall seeing the two tabs I dropped among bits and chunks of Oreos in his sink. At this point I am freaking out

Then

I felt as if I was being born again. I had no sense of self, delirious among the black vomit which surrounded me, I try latching onto his conversation in an attempt to hold onto reality; for the white tiles on the floor and all auditory stimuli were being blended together into an amalgam of beautiful yet terrifying kaleidoscopic cornucopia of fractals.

*That was the longest fucking phone call in history*.

When they finally come over I am lying on his dining room floor, including my father. They try speaking to me, and I have difficulty reciprocating. I kept asking the same questions, and I was reduced to a childlike state of fear and unknowing. I wanted to know what we were doing, I asked over and over again- and they assured me that they're just cleaning things up and I have to calm down and drink water. I thought they were speaking a different language. I lied back down and my body was wringed out over and over again for what seemed like months. I get back up after what was actually close to half an hour and empty my bowels in the now-clean bathroom. I get somewhat cleaned up and I go into my friend's air-conditioned room, turn the lights off, turned his star-projector on, put my headphones in, and I come back out

My friend is 6' tall (183cm) and weighs around 140lbs (63.5kg). My girlfriend is 5'11"" (180cm) and weighs 117lbs (53kg). I am 5'4"" (163cm) and 107lbs (48.5kg). Another friend of mine who is 5'7"" (170cm) and 160lbs (72.5kg) had a great experience on the same acid, et al. may have been a result of differing body weights. I am very, very skinny and have close to 7 pounds (3.2kg) of fat in my body, as well as a BMI of 18. Would this be the cause of my previous experiences? Or, if anyone here is familiar with jerseycow's product (which I'm sure many are) would the nausea, sweating, vomiting, but I would just like to hear your thoughts and experiences. Thanks,,

I have a couple questions. Hoping for some insight. A group of 4 of us are going for an LSD trip in June. 2 of us (my boyfriend and I) have had very trriiipppy trips before (I've experienced LSD about 4 times before...and my bf even more...we never knew what the doses were though). 

My sister (Sue) has tried it twice with us but it wasn't very strong and my other sister (Karry) pretty much never tried it before.

We have 150ug blotters. I need to know how much you think each of us should be taking? 

My bf and I

My sister (Sue)

And my inexperienced sister (Karry) should take 1 or...? (she has a paranoid, but we still want to be cautious)...more info on Karry: She doesn't like the way weed makes her feel. Says it amplifies her anxiety/panic attacks...so if she ever smokes, she only takes a few pulls. She is fine with Alcohol. Has no experience with other substances. 

I don't want my sisters to have a lesser experience. I would love for us all to be on the same level more or less and to have the time of our lives...but how do we figure out the right doses for each of us? 

Can you take one now and then if it's not strong enough

Any advice would be sooo appreciated! Thanks guys! 

P.S. No real names were used. :P

EDIT:
Oh yes! **One more question.** My bf and I bought extra so we were wondering...it's been 2 years since we had any...and we want the trip in June to be special. Though we were thinking of trying half or 1 hit each in the coming weekend...would it build our resistance up and require us to take more in the June trip than we would have if we just waited til June? Is it advisable to take LSD a few weeks apart? What do you think?

1346903129.0,zfkpv,A Fascinating Trip,HoboWithADildo,14,2,2,"I bought two tabs of sunshine LSD on Monday and went to my best friend J's apartment to trip with him. My other friend A was there as well. I planned on taking 1 and a half tabs while J took a half (it was his first trip and he's usually a light weight on any drug so it seemed fitting). We dropped them at about 7:30 that night and we started to really feel the effects at around 8:30. A never really considered taking LSD until I was offered a good deal on two more tabs for $5 each, goofy face looked really sinister and trippy. It was a pretty mindblowing movie to watch on acid. The screen was moving a lot as well

Later, music, and art compiled into these videos. We were laughing and freaking out the whole time, and one video had a creepy looking girl pop out at the end which scared the fuck out of us and I screamed ""Fuck the asshole that made this video!"" but we ended up laughing anyway. I was relieved that it didn't ruin my trip. 

After about a half hour of trippy videos, mankind and the universe is. Laying down in the grass staring up at the stars was a sight like I've never seen before. My mind was so blown that I had to remind myself to blink because I couldn't pull myself away from the sky's beauty. It looked like there were thousands of stars dancing, twinkling, and changing colours. Airplanes flying by looked like shooting stars. Looking back down at the grass was amazing too because the texture of it looked so fancy and surreal. There was a bridge nearby where I could see lots of car lights flashing by and leaving behind tremors. The lake was also magnificent. I realized that the outdoors is where I should have spent most of my trip. I could describe it as being an alien visiting Earth for the first time. A was also fascinated by it all and he's never been much of a nature person as far as I know, but I'm sure he is now. LSD really awakens an appreciation of nature, art, and music. That trip helped me remember that the world is an awesome place and that I want to experience it as long as possible. This trip also helped me decide more on what I want to do for a living. I want to do something that will show people my visions

A and I were pretty frustrated that J didn't want to come walk with us because he was missing out on so much. But maybe someday he will trip again and realize how much he was missing out on instead of watching the same movie twice in one night. A left at about 3 that morning and had school in a few hours so I wonder how that turned out for him. I feel like being in a setting like that would be make me anxious or scared but A didn't seem to consider anything bad happening. He saw acid as the greatest thing in the world when I was talking to him

Later that night

Before I knew it, or wherever else. I went out to my car to sit and listen to the radio for a while. Some Ed Sheeran was playing which relaxed me a bit as I looked out of the frosted windshield. Fractal looking lights and drops of water were covered all over it. It was a pretty beautiful morning. The trip was really settling down, or so I thought. I felt fit to drive so I head for Walmart/McDonald's to get a frappe. My perception was a bit off and lights still looked pretty bright but I just took things slow and paid super close attention to the cars in front of me. 

Walking around WalMart was pretty weird. Everything felt off. Kind of like living in the Matrix. I looked at all these people going about their everyday lives and thought about how crazy it was that I was probably the only person in the store tripping on acid. I even felt like people were talking to me, I looked at my phone to see that letters and numbers were still pretty wavy. I felt badass that I made it home in that state of mind, but next time I'm avoiding driving until I know for sure that I'm sober. I wouldn't recommend driving on acid. I pet my dogs for a bit and took some melatonin to fall asleep faster since I was still wired but fried. I took a three hour nap and woke up feeling kind of rested, then I made a sandwich since I hadn't eaten in almost 24 hours. My trip was pretty much over at that point, which I was glad because I really just wanted to eat and sleep at this point, as beautiful as all the visuals were.

To make sure that I wasn't freaked out, I picked up the syringe, took the top off and looked at it plainly.  Still no freak out.  Just to make sure, I volunteered to give our dog the insulin shot.

This is one of the strangest tricks my brain has ever pulled on me.  I almost couldn't believe it.  It's been a little over 2 weeks now, the ""freak out!"" sort of feeling I used to have is replaced by a methodical sort of calmness.  I don't understand it.

Now, I did heavily alter my brain chemistry with synthetic drugs.  But its been over 2 weeks now, and frankly, my anxiety towards needles is %99 gone.  I am cured.

I used to think of myself as someone who has really strong visions

When you trip on lsd you also experience sensations eliciting other sensations, these connections are involuntary-- you jump from one to another against your will (hence 'looping'). However, like in a *lucid* dream, you're aware of what's going on and you get to basically control your immediate actions (although you can't really plan what will come after that) and you get to have *some* influence on the story. But it really feels like being in a dream-- your brain goes into the same mode when you're dreaming, where you subconsiously know that you're the only person here really experiencing it. In a dream you take eveything that happens to be part of some overarching story about you, because even in a non-lucid dream part of you knows that it really is all about you. 

When you trip on LSD your brain goes into dream mode and partly thinks you're in REM (the lightest phase of sleep), wait, everyone else is experiencing this world too?!

I'm fairly experienced with LSD and thought I'd share my opinion on the differences (and hope to hear yours!)

I took a 1.2mg tab

I would equate it with one hit of good acid.

I found the come-up quite pleasant, but it wasn't uncomfortable like acid can be. For me with acid sometimes I have trouble making the transition into the acid head-space.

I didn't really feel like there was a definite peak

Visually, but I didn't get much breathing or swirling like I would with acid.

My friend

Mentally my head was quite clear. I felt silly and happy but not crazy like acid can be.

My friend and I listened to music and we noted how we could really get into it and listen to all the different parts but weren't emotionally overwhelmed. We could listen to jarring or discordant music without feeling overly identified with it.

I think LSD is much more euphoric.

""Spiritually"" LSD is superior

Also I seemed to come down quite suddenly - within about 30 minutes the visuals went from fairly strong to almost nothing. With LSD I'd still be seeing breathing/swirling for ages. Which can be good or bad.

As I came down I noticed body tension and jaw clenching

Although I'd planned to sleep at my friend's place I drove the 10 minutes home - which I'd never consider after LSD. [I don't recommend this

I got to sleep fairly easily on only .5mg xanax. On acid for me that's almost impossible

The reason I'm making this post is to let people know about my experience of dosing while taking noopept a potent nootropic. Recently when I've been dosing I've been getting a good body high, very little visuals, open eyed and closed. So I ordered 5 mg of noopept after reading reviews online and others experiences.

So I ordered some noopept from a site. I started taking about 10-20mg of it daily about 5 days before I planned on tripping. After about 3 days on just noopept, I took my morning helping of noopept, went to work, and came home and had dinner. After dinner I took about 10-20mg more of noopept about an hour prior to dosing. At about 10 pm I popped 4 tabs of ""meh"" quality tabs (stuff I had laid myself at about 50-80 mics each). 

After about 15 minutes,  when it took me about 2 hours of watching AD and Alice in W. to roll a single dutch into a blunt. There were times where I was at the point of crying from laughter from the smallest things, and an amazing overall perception of the world as it is, and the nature of humans and nature itself.

Overall, I laid in bed and had the best CEV for about 2 hours while listening to music. From what I understand, the noopept allowed the receptors in my brain to be flooded with the lsd.

i kept getting into thought loops and everything seemed to happen frame by frame. thankfully, the ink would stretch on my hand and my fingers looked crazy.

I then walk down my street to my friends house because i was taking care of his dogs for the weekend. The walk down was magnificent. i watched people's driveways flow and form waves like at the end of the acid scene in that woodstock movie. flowers seemed to explode and i couldnt stop smiling.

once i get in his house

He was going to smoke weed and i really missed when i was able to but cant due to drug testing. so i was clean for 2.5 months. i realized i had a four day weekend and could most likely get clean by the end of it so i said why not.

I take a 1 mid sized rip, everything melting together. it was mind blowing. his house melted into the trees and had the branches curl into it.

i wanted to go inside but stay outside

from here

i went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror.  that was incredible and is where i learned about alot about myself. you can take 2 paths going in there. the happy path, where you learn flaws about yourself. i took both at different times and found lessons that i wanna keep private. also watching your face morph and change was sick. we watched a bunch of cartoons like danny phantom, adventure time, sesame street etc and that all seems to be made for acid. it was perfect.

i went home around 2pm and put my music on shuffle while i watched tv. i didnt know how to change the channel and that show general hospital was on. the lyrics in the music fit perfect with the mouths moving and was hilarious.

1 year ago (December 9th) I dropped acid for the first time. I made pretty much every mistake i could have made (college the next day, had done no research into the drug whatsoever) needless to say at about 3am the trip went bad, and after turning out the lights and 'trying to go to sleep' my memories from there on were pretty much 5 hours of paralysing fear, thought loops, and body tremors.
This is extremely unlike me as i am usually quite smart with drugs
Up until this point i had tried alcohol, and MDMA, with good experiences all round.

Anyway i felt kind of odd after the trip, had a bad trip, and 17 years later they are still dealing with the effects of it, anxious to this day. 
At this point i fucking lost it, unable to stop thinking about what had happened, and whether or not i had permanently ruined my mind. 
Here i am a year later, and i still get waves of anxiety whenever the memory pops up. 

Mainly i would like to ask you whether my weed smoking habit plays a large part in this, in fact it was something i classed as benefitting me. It was something i wrestled with, decided whether i needed to stop or not, because i do not want to say goodbye to Mary Jane forever. yet i can see that had i just abstained from the start, this may have passed a long time ago. It has been the main factor in a few flashbacks and relapses into anxiety, and i would like to ask ever-wise reddit if now, a year later, and start over.
Weirdly enough, as is expected..

This spring i was tripping at a music festival and hanging out around the fire there was a girl selling jewelry she made. I was feeling pretty good so i took a look and although i don't ever wear jewelry i saw a pretty cool ring made from a piece of sterling silverware. It was a man's size and she only wanted 5 bucks for it so i figured what the hell. I ended up wearing that and another ring i bought for my girlfriend the whole night

Another time my girlfriend and I are tripping on Halloween, probably a block down we heard some cats playing the Beatles, not blasting it but we could hear it from their open window so we said to ourselves ""Those guys must be cool, lets see if they want to party"" so we walked up the stairs and knocked on the door. We basically told the dude who answered we heard some groovy music and would they like to hang out.  It turned out THEY were all on acid too! We ended up smoking ganja and apparently weirding them the fuck out for like 3 hours, but it was a blast. 

If i think of any more; and I swear every time there's SOMETHING; I;ll definitely post.

I was stuck in a cycle. My boyfriend would ask me ""Don't you remember you just did this?"" I would get up drink water go to the bathroom look in my bag for random things get more water go to the bathroom etc.. But I couldn't remember doing any of it immediately after doing it . 

My boyfriend asked me where something was (like my emergency xanax) and I would hand him a water bottle and was convinced it was whatever he was looking for. 

I had been going in and out of reality but in one moment I was holding my stomach and in the matter of seconds I felt my body go through an entire 9 month pregnancy and have birth. However the next thing I knew it was me who had been born. 

My boyfriend would ask me questions such as do you want the light off? do you want the music low? and I would reply yes which seems extremely normal except the entire time I was thinking that I had been almost dissociated and seeing my own process of my conscious mind making decisions and even though he was literally turning the light off or music low in my mind it was me all along. 

There were other times where everything would blur and all I can see is my boyfriends face come in and out. sometimes he would be telling me it was OK and I was fine and other times he was crying. However

I couldn't tell my boyfriend what day it was even. My boyfriend told me after this he thought that the next day he would have to tell everyone something terrible had happened to me and he was ready to take care of me for the rest of my life. He said I was acting like I was preparing to die. Honestly that's exactly what I was doing.

here to share my first LSD experience - new years 2011/2012. I know it's a long way back but it is still imprinted in my brain minute after minute and up to date has still been the most amazing trip I experienced so far :)

I was in the mountains in Austria so everywhere around me where loads of snow and we spent the beginning of the night at a classical Austrian cottage. I dropped half a blotter cause I was a bit nervous and didn't want to risk too much. Blotter was tasteless so I was first confused but my friend calmed me saying that this was normal for proper LSD. After an hour I still felt nothing so my suspicion kept rising that it was just a piece of paper. I took the other half and went on chatting with the other people. Maybe half an our later I feel like my brain is shifting up a gear. Vision on my periphery got slightly blurred (Or I was actually first time really aware about peripheral vision)

I started enjoying the surrounding. As people where drunk around I felt really safe that nobody would recognize and joined in into the dancing. It was very strange as I felt like sometimes I'd be dancing in the middle of the whole crowd with everyone around me and then suddenly I would be outside that circle. Very very strange. The LSD by that time kicked in very hard and I think I was not fully aware of myself and rather went with the flow.

At midnight for some reason an ex-affair called me after not hearing from her for one year. I went into a separated room and crazily enough picked up the phone. I don't fully recall the conversation but that doesn't matter. The phone would have a tin canny mechanical sound and even my voice would be very muffled. It felt like the movie calls you hear in cinemas at times. The funny thing was I started to see that the light was moving in waves and emitted very warm and vibrant colours. This small room had also a small mountain diorama behind me and I felt like I was hearing animals (maybe it was the people mixing in from the other room) Well I turned and saw this fairy tale diorama with dwarfs

I really don't know how I finished the call but ultimately I went outside and I saw the most beautiful thing. The night was dark and a bit of snow was falling - clear sharp crystals. The mountains looked like wrapped in very dense fluffy cotton and on everything lay this white heavenly gloom. We met outside with my friend and some other girls and decided to continue the journey - he recommended a shift of place. From this moment I was riding on the wave of LSD - my brain shifted another gear up but this time I felt I was under full control. You know when you drive first time a new car and you first are a bit careful with shifting. At some point you get a feel for the car - and I got the feel for LSD. Time to hit the pedal to the metal I took another half blotter.

The cottage was on a ski slope with an adjacent sleight trail into the village. We had small classical wooden sleighs prepared. We took each a girl in front of us and went down the track. It was crazy

Arriving in the village I felt already like a day had passed - my time perception was completely fucked up. Seconds became minutes and minutes became several minutes. Not speaking bout hours. Walking down the street I was amazed by the tyre tracks of cars printed into the snow. They had such a perfect shape and icy reflection. Looking back at the mountain we just went down I saw the whole track moving in wave forms with the lights slowly swinging back and forth. We came into a bar where people would stand around a log of would. They would have steel nails prepared on the log and try to hit them with the thin end of a claw hammer. After observing the scene and enjoying the sound of the hammer hitting the wood and metal the people invited us to join. I took the hammer

Next I went to the toilet and I felt as if the room would be out of some weird early 90s music video with crazy colours

As we reached the hotel I felt I was back to myself and only the visuals prevailed. To come back to the car analogy

During 7 am I decided to go to sleep as for the morning the program called for a 1 hour walk to another cottage at the afternoon. Well what can I say? I haven't slept a minute. Upon closing the eyes I would have images of deeply coloured fractals and kaleidoscopic patterns. Visuals didn't stop in the end until I went to bed during the next evening. In the afternoon I was actually for a few moments scared I might have done some permanent changes to my brain.

Looking back despite some difficult moments I like to recall that trip very much. It showed me the many facets of LSD there are and I got to understand why it is called a trip. I really felt that I left for another world and once in a while a light would have its gloomy wavy features like a nice greeting from this other reality.

Btw. some recommendations for first timers ... don't use on yourself any strong perfume or deodorant. As your senses increase so does your capacity to smell and these substance tend to stick on you. Really annoying when you smell cologne no.5 or which ever you use

1360373173.0,1862i5,Easing back into LSD after a bad trip (x-post from /r/drugs),FiigNag,15,2,10,"When I was sixteen during the summer of 2011 I had an awful trip on two hits of acid that kinda ruined most drugs for me. I wrote about it at length on this subreddit a while ago but I'm too lazy to find it. Long story short: started out fantastic, got naked, or some other mental illness. I still fear this even though I have been told by medical professionals that I do not have either. Although I do experience depression from time to time

So I swore off psychedelics for a while until March of last year when I thought I was ready and took two hits of acid by myself. The trip went smoothly until I had a thought and visuals that reminded me of the initial bad trip when I was 16 and started to panic a bit. I alleviated the panic by taking a tablet of lorazepam but I felt terrible about ""aborting"" the trip and not being able to work through it. I told myself I wasn't ever going to take acid again and I was left with general anxiety for a couple months after that. Weed would make me anxious and remind me of the bad trip and any other drug experiences I had (cannabis

Since then I've started to analyze these experiences every day in depth and identify certain issues and insecurities I needed to work on. I've also started to see a therapist and experiment successfully with yoga and meditation. Over the past year I've undergone a rapid restructuring of my ego and my view of the world and the universe (some might call this ""growing up""). I experience derealization and depression on and off but I've learned to accept it as just another perspective of reality. Originally I had thought I had had psychotic episode with the initial experience but after researching all that I can

I haven't taken any drugs other than cannabis since July of last year up until last week. While I still experience some anxiety from it, my plan is to buy three hits and take one. If I enjoy myself on one then I'll take the other two at a later date, possibly in conjunction with a small dose of MDMA I have stashed somewhere. I feel that one tab will be enough to get me re-acquainted with the psychedelic experience but still allow me to have enough contact with reality to recognize that I'm tripping if things happen to go south. I expect to run into anxiety and even panic but I plan to just work through it and any other issues I may have reminding myself that acid will not kill me and that I'm just experiencing ego-loss (possibly while reading excerpts from The Psychedelic Experience by Timothy Leary). I also plan to meditate and perform yoga sometime during the experience. However, my main fear is that my plans will go out the window at the slightest feeling of panic and I'll be in the same situation I was in last time, undoing all progress I have made over the past year and a half. So I come to you guys for a second opinion.

1358441380.0,16rbx0,Integrating my fear during an acid trip - need advice,fearofreality,14,4,16,"Hello fellow psychonauts.  I come to you seeking advice for my future trips.  I am fairly inexperienced in the psychedelic world as I have only tripped twice on acid before and a few times on salvia.  My last trip on acid involved two tabs.  Reality was mostly intact

As night came, I decided to look at myself in the mirror.  I had done this plenty of times before in the day with no difficulty.  While I saw my face almost “age” in a sense, I really didn’t see morphing of anything.  This changed at night.  My face began to subtly twist so that my mouth spiraled into a circular void.  My eyes were similar, almost giving the appearance that I was a demon.  This scared me.  I began feeling anxious as I was faced with the reality that I was out of control.  I saw my boyfriend’s face appear darker around his eyes.  Although I knew I had taken acid and it was temporary, the fear was prominent.  I began feeling the familiar anxiety of a panic attack.  My rational brain told myself all the things you’re supposed to, yes it’s a drug, that wasn’t real, etc.  However, what if I start seeing his face melt

I believe that it is all a based on a few simple things: a fear of the unknown and a lack of control.  If I start to hallucinate, will it be a self-fulfilling prophecy where I do not want to see/think of dark things, but that mere desire will send me into those thoughts?  Or perhaps it goes beyond that and it’s just a simple fear of losing control and facing the unknown.  What a bizarre thing to be afraid of though considering one is never in control of the unknown, especially in your day to day life.

So the question comes to this, I felt like I simply do not like reality distortion in that way and tripping is not for me.  But I believe I do.  I certainly enjoy the other aspects of tripping.  For the majority of the day I felt very euphoric and had a great time with my boyfriend who was not tripping but simply high on cannabis.  How can I confront that fear and anxiety?  During my experience, I couldn’t simply talk myself out of it.  However being tired of tripping took away my energy and I just attempted to avoid the waves and watch TV, instead of redirecting my thoughts into a acid-worthy activity.

Thanks for reading if you made it through this.  It was therapeutic to type it all out.

Edit - I know most of you are going to tell me to go the safe route and just take 1. But I'm willing to push my limits this time. Do you still think the risk is worth it?

Final Edit - I ended up taking 3. For about an hour I was struggling with reality. My vision was easily getting blurred by everything trying to split.

1374445680.0,1irvrq,Trip report: A Night That Changed Everything.,UnicornMania,14,5,6,"Sometimes things happen that you never want to think about again due to denial of what you witnessed.
Sometimes you witness something so impactful that you can not help but accept it into your mind eventually.
Which is why I am finally deciding to put into words my experience from 3 months ago.
This was my third trip, and I needed to find out what that was.
So I took the leap

The main issue was my environment. I was in a comfortable enough setting, and way too many people who I did not really know. I was in a strange depressive funk at the time and my mind was definitely thinking differently due to the excessive amount of weed I had been smoking and how much I had been sulking for the past 6 months. I was ""living in my head.""
Only later did I realize how little I actually knew what that meant.

At first things are going well
Later I found out after this I started talking to one of the randoms at my house about God and spirituality

God and religion were definitely 2 things really eating at me and bugging me beforehand, and soon I was stuck in a loop where I kept questioning my existence and what was happening, I was freaking out, I literally felt my soul was leaving my body and I had no control over it, and I couldn't accept that, I just couldn't accept losing my sense of self. I wasn't ready to know I existed as anything more than just me. 
Eventually I lost it, God does not exist!""
And that scared the fuck out of me
and thats where I really lost it.

I felt my entire life didn't happen, and I eventually snapped out. It was like snapping out of one brain into another one if that makes sense, but the brain I had now snapped into was so much more capable than the one before, and in this new ""brain"", I existed infinitely, I had completely lost that feeling that I exist. That one thing that when you close your eyes and really zone out that is always there. It was just gone. 
I felt I had lived my life up until that point as a teenage girl (Im a guy)

After this freak out, and I laid back, and went into my mind. 
I found out I was literally inside of my head, because what is real life, but what our minds can perceive? Then I realized I was actually apart of something much bigger than myself, and as a human being I could not understand why, and it reaffirmed my faith in a God. ""There is something bigger than me, just accept it, and be grateful that you are blessed to be apart of this something.""

I realized heaven might as well be a place in the mind, and there was a moment where I stopped freaking out for a little bit and went somewhere that made me feel content, and I could have stayed there forever, but then something told me  ""you haven't lived your life yet you will get here when you die, this is just a peak behind to keep you going"". It sure as hell did keep me going

I honestly did not even cover a quarter of what I experienced

We are capable of more than we know.

God.

Small square of
the skin of trees
under his naive tongue
he laughed his anxiety
in to madness.

Maybe
that in order
to see God
he would have to die
he wouldn't
have been so

Reality dripped away
like the sky's tears
from his Jeep's

Caught between devouring light

the lives and deaths

Feeling
the end near and
having spent himself

he'd soon
be gone.

With a final lament --

he let go.
An eye remeniscent

of Eternity;
he died and became
one
with the Universe.

LSD let me feel like I was the captain of the ship for once. I didn't get wrapped up in my own head for hours on end and it was MUCH easier to handle than a mushroom trip.

I'm glad I finally took the plunge because it really is an amazing drug. Sex feels oh so good on it and watching my room look like a salvador dali painting for six hours was a blast!

Background:

I've been experimenting with LSD for about 9 months now. I've had about 20 trips ranging from 150 to 700 micrograms. I've been steadily upping my dose over the summer

My solo trip ritual was about the same

I took the dose about noon and within half an hour I was on the ground looking at my fingertip and contemplating how remarkable the day was as I slowly slipped into the trip without even knowing it. I had a revelation that was so absurd (but true) about myself that I began to laugh. The laugh felt like it lasted ages, thinking it might calm me down. On my way back up the trip kicked in hard, and as I made my way up the stairs I could feel my head inflating and the entire world bent around me as I walked. Before I could reach the top of the stairs I had forgotten everything about myself, where I was, what I was doing except that I was on acid and that I realized 'oh, so this is what a bad trip is like.'  'Oh, now I understand.' A rather terrifying moment was when I realized that I thought I was dying and I thought, Okay."" As if I didn't even care.

I was so panicked. One of the things I thought about was taking a picture of myself to check whether I appeared to be in distress, I turned on my computer and sent a few panicked messages to a friend online -- the chat window still open from earlier in the morning. I instantly thought he was going to call the police, an ambulance, and I would be in trouble. Reading the logs back, it was clear he had no intention. I had, in my paranoid state, read back my own words thinking they were his. 

I spent the next hour or so peaking, put on some music, and calmed down. 

Here's an excerpt from the chat log: http://pastebin.com/5wFbhjUB

It's somewhat funny to read, rewarding, and healing it is still a powerful drug. I'm going to spend a while without tripping to decompress and think about this last trip. I've left some of the insights that I need to think about out of this post because I'm not sure just what they all mean, and it would be a tantamount to a lie to share them just now.

I told my friend and asked him to count with me and he ended up having the same effect, minus the flashbacks. We chalked it up to just tripping hard and shrugged it off.

I recently tripped with one of my best friends

Tony has always had a bit of an arrogance problem.  I know him well enoough to know that he isn't a shallow person--but you have to know him for quite a while to realize this because in his day to day life he is pretty full of himself.  I've see him send mean text messages just to burn bridges with girls where things haven't gone quite right.  I've heard him say things that made me question his character.  Recently out of the Navy and skating through life on his GI bill, it was my oppinion (and that of some fello psychnauts) that he could benefit from some introspection.

I mentioned that I had tried acid recently and he was curious about it.  He wanted to trip with me.  I'd never push a psychadelic on somebody--you either want to or you don't and peer pressure shouldn't factor into it.  I must confess I may have been a bit too encouraging.

We went camping.  I had told him that he shouldn't get stoned... that he should wait to see how he handles the acid and then consider smoking.  In typical Tony fashion

My good friend James and myself had decided that four hits was the number for us.  We had all talked about three for Tony and liked that number, at about 10,000 feet, on acid, is not exactly the smartest survival choice, and somebody had joked about ""we could die out here.""  The joke then became: if anybody is going to die today, it's going to be of happiness.  This will turn out to be ironic later.

James and I took our four.  Tony took three and half an hour later decided that he wanted to be at the same level as we were, I thought what the hell.

The first three hours were absolutely amazing.  I could go on for pages about it.  Suffice it to say

After a small hike we came back to camp and Tony was babbling on.  He is a loudmouth anyway, but usually they have a concept of who they are, who you are, where they are.  The words coming out of his mouth were pure nonesense.  I would make him look at me and say ""Tony, who am I?""  And he would say ""All that fire, with the eyes above, and we totally made it here.  We got here guys

It did not seem to me like the sort of thing you come down from or sleep off.  He had lost his mind.  His shoes began to melt by the fire, and at one point hugged him.  During our hug he did this hip/ass caress thing.  I'm sure it wasn't a homosexuality issue--not that I'd have a problem if it was, I'm just quite sure about Tony.  He wasn't aware that who he was hugging was male.  Several times I had to physically *make* him sit down to prevent him from wandering off in the woods.  

James and I were so glad that he wasn't violent--because if he had been we would have had to tie him up.  We were suddenly camping with somebody who belonged in a mental asylum.  He seemed to have his wits about him well enough to not sit on the fire, and I control all of this, as we did it, we are here to watch it all burn but it is ours so it's ok, just keep the ground at bay.""

EDIT: we were only going to call his mom if he didn't come out of it after a couple of days.  He lives with her and she'd be wondering why he didn't come home--or why he was unable to tie his shoes.

This went on for three hours before he started addressing us as people again.  He'd come in and out.  As we came down Tony came back to us.  At eight hours post-dose we had him back fully

Since then he has been more introspective, he was elated through the whole trip.  Basically, instead of peaking, he died of happiness.  He wants to trip again with us, though probably won't get high beforehand an wants to just to two or three.
  
  I've read about how LSD can bring out latent psychosis in people, so maybe that's all that happened.  He has no memory of the time when we should have been peaking (his behavior kind of killed it for us) but looks back on it fondly.

For example

* If I begin to have a thought loop

* Communicating is incredibly difficult

* There is an almost palpable group energy. While this can be wonderful in happy moments, which can build up to cause the infamous

* ""Resonance Cascade"". From the corner of his eye, causing a great deal of discomfort for all involved and pulling the group further and further into the realm of primal fear that is a true bad trip. This epic example of trip-bleeding and mass failure of group synergy at exactly the wrong time has put the kibosh on acid for many a fledgling psychonaut. Even for the seasoned few, it can *really* ruin your day and possibly the rest of the week. This is why I personally consider it to be by far the worst thing one can encounter on a trip (that can be directly attributed to acid, that is).

On the other hand

* Thought loops happen quite frequently, the only way I could detect it myself is by listening to my incredibly frazzled and jumpy inner voice and trying to look for a pattern. *However*, when I happened to fall into one during a facebook-chat, it became glaringly obvious. The chat box became rife with ""I still don't see how that applies to what I said before,"" and I grew nervous.

* Without communication

* Without people, but you've got no outside help and it takes such a long while that you may just forget what was happening. You're literally immune to what I consider to be the worst possible thing that can happen on on acid trip.

Some important points:
- It was one week ago now and I still have no signs of the cops. The girls neither.  
- They said to them that it's gonna take one month for the urine test. Seems bullshit to me
- The girls didn't mention the name of the substance. They just said ""he gave me a tiny paper I put in my mouth""

Since my trip I have had a lot of fun, lazy, never really left my house, or did much of anything. All of that has changed.

One thing I'm unsure about is that I've grown apart from my friend who made sure I didn't do anything stupid whilst tripping. He was my best friend before

After I dropped, I hated to be alone, and I didn't know if I was glad that I felt different or not. Now the days are flying by again, I don't see anything wrong with the way people look at me, I spend time alone with out batting an eye, and I don't feel different; I feel like me.

I can rationalize how differently I should think, and actually doing it aren't happening. I think ultimately, and truthfully, I feel as though I will never genuinely be happy unless I have some form of experience. No matter how good it gets for me, I also find something to drag it down.

1361055789.0,18ntih,Acid trip ends abruptly only half-way through? ,Deepari,12,2,13,"   Yesterday my friend and I took some acid

   From my experience it was pretty strong; I dont know the amount in micrograms, like ""holograms"" floating around the air that I could push around by waving my arms. 

   My friend started hallucinating after an hour

   Then after around 5 hours right around my peak she tells me she felt completely sober. All effects seemed to fade away within an hour. I continued tripping for around another 6 hours before I could fall asleep. Judging from what she was describing
 
   The next day

  I'm still puzzled as to why her trip lasted only 5 hours

  The only physical difference I could think of is that shes heavier than me and she drinks ALOT of water. I've known a few dozen people that have tripped

  It also couldn't have been uneven doses in the blotter paper because I saw for myself the sheet where it was cut from; both our squares were near each other in the same corner.

 She mentioned that before she's taken shrooms before

**TLDR;** Friend and I take nearly identical doses; she has a trip that was intense but lasted only 5 hours. I have a full 12 hour trip. Any idea what happened? ",,t5_2qhvj,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/18ntih/acid_trip_ends_abruptly_only_halfway_through/

Every time I take a hallucinogen and start to peak, but then every time I peak, I say to myself I shouldn't trip again. So, I usually tend to freak out a little bit during my peaks. Only on a couple of occasions have I actually **freaked** out in which I needed the assistance of others, but in every peak I get scared and my heart races and I get awkward and I need to leave where I'm at. I usually trip in pretty comfortable environments too, so that isn't the cause. I just get very introverted and the thoughts I get are often very scary and pessimistic and paranoid. After the peak though, I have a phenomenal time, and now whenever I drop LSD

I love tripping, so that stuff doesn't much play a factor. I think it really is just an internal thing within me that causes me to bad trip, but that isn't to say I don't think I can change that.

For a school assignment my topic is LSD. Its not an extremely in depth assignment just plenty of general information and facts about the drug such as;The short term effects of using this drug , past or present (if any), Laws concerning the control of this drug ect. The reason I came here to ask is that hopefully you guys would know the places with the best information and correct facts cause I got into an argument with my teacher who was saying LSD is a dangerous drug and will just completely mess you up no matter what even if you have a good trip and that there is no medical uses for it according to her. This annoyed me cause I know she is not entirely correct so I chose LSD to hopefully open my teachers eyes with some correct information and facts that I can reference and possibly prove her wrong. I myself have never taken LSD but it is something I wish to experience atleast once.

Once we get to the club we realised how packed its going to be and I am a little nervous. so its 10:30pm and I drop my tab, she is an amazing dj! at 11:30 I'm starting to come up quickly from the tab so i drop my cap of molly about 0.1 grams. standing infront of the sound booth just dancing a little to Minx going to the bar and back to get water for my brother and I. 

Finally at 12:30 am Madeon arrives and busts out some heavy tunes! By this time I am overwhealmed by the euphoria music is sounding amazing and my molly and lsd are peaking perfectly in sync

This is his [**opening**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNzWPwDeYW8&amp;hd=1), by now he is half way through his set and its 1:00 and I'm still peaking hard! when he decides to drop [**the island remix**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-13agoYwLuw&amp;hd=1), and [**que vuex-tu**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_YKMXJ4sIA&amp;hd=1) After this I stop recording songs to enjoy my self a little until he plays his last song and I thought I must capture this beauty first hand! he does his little launch pad set up and give his master piece [**Pop culture**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIfsU-A5wcs&amp;hd=1)! At 1:30 am it is now very hot inside and as you can see very packed. I think without the mdma I would have freaked by now. I've been chewing some gum to cope with the teeth grinding.

Minx comes back on for 20 minutes as Avicii is a little late, to keep me going through the rest of the night. Avicii is amazing as usual I ask my brother how he is feeling and he tells me ""Dude this night is the best night I have ever gone out to!"" he has been clubbing and raving for 8 years fyi. 

Then about half way through Avicii's set 2:40 I start peaking off my other pill
This is perfect timing as he drops one of my favourite songs and mash up of the two songs my brother had at his wedding ceremony

Avicii goes onto play another hour after this pumping out so many great songs with flawless mixing! One of Aviciis Last songs was this awesome mash up! I wasnt able to record it but i found somone else who did on youtube that night [**Avicii - Levels That I Used To Know**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2zKNmKBGWg&amp;hd=1) After Avcii's set finishes for some reason I start peaking again, and then we headed to macca's.

Last night was my year's formal afterparty

As you can probably tell

I approached them this morning and asked them when their next show was

Today I watched [Diggnation #0333](http://revision3.com/diggnation/googlemaps) and they talked about Steve Jobs and LSD. Glenn McElhose noted that LSD isn't as bad as people make it out to be and said that there have been no deaths or addiction to it. 

There is so much propaganda on cannabis that I'm actually not inclined to listen to any statistics. The negative stigma on drugs also doesn't help when you see footage of people doing stupid things while on it.

TL;TR I would like to hear from the users of LSD:

* What are you experiences with it?
* Are there any precautions you should take?
* How do you tell the difference between a dodgy batch of LSD or not?

That's all the questions I can think of.

Basically I felt completely detached from all reality, what my purpose was, what year it was were all gone. I couldn't comprehend other people, or people in general. Society as a whole seemed to be some strange fantasy. Anytime I tried to think about anything, I was bombarded with confusion and anxiety. I was lost in my mind, and I began to think of myself as insane. I thought I had gone permanently insane and would be this way forever (whatever forever was anyway).

Along with this, DC on the national mall admiring the monuments with my friends). I felt that no matter what I did, I couldn't manage to get somewhere were I was comfortable, or where I belonged. It turned out to be one of the most fearful experiences of my life. I found myself curled up in a ball on a park bench when the trip started to subside. All I remember of this portion (being curled up on the bench) is thinking that death was imminent, and that my insanity completely overcame me.

Anyway, so when I did, I only ate 1 g, and didnt feel much. I haven't done it since.

I have heard from my friends (the definition of seasoned drug users) that acid is a lot more mellow and in control. The analogy one of them used was ""You do acid. Shrooms do you."" Judging by that I feel like I'd be much better off doing Acid if I would have a tendancy to bring negative feelings and anxiety into the trip. I've also heard that you should always keep some benzo's on hand when tripping because taking them will end the trip/erase bad thoughts. Maybe even

1374861182.0,1j3z27,Will I ever be able to trip again?,brainbuttz420,14,5,26,A few months ago I dropped acid for the first time. I had done psilocybin mushrooms before and always had a great time but for some reason my LSD trip went differently. After feeling the effects only 20 minutes after taking the tabs I grew more and more anxious. As the effects intensified I began to entirely loose my sense of reality. During my trip I actually began to harm myself and a few of my sober friends ended up calling 911 (being sent to the hospital may have not been the best thing in the end as it was quite frightening). The cognitive side of my trip was actually quite enlightening and perspective changing but the fact that my reality entirely fell apart makes me very nervous to ever try psychedelics again. I later found out that the tabs I ingested were each 100ug (I took 2) which may have been why I had such an intense experience. I would like to trip again (at a lower dose of course) but I am very nervous of having a similar experience. What do you guys think? ,t5_2qhvj,True

An old roommate of mine from college (we're both 21 now) happens to be back in town and we're going to take LSD for the first time together. We lived together freshman year so we trust the shit out of each other I'd say.

We both have smoked quite a bit in the past but have never done any hallucinogens though have contemplated for a while. Long story short he finally came across some from a friend (he says it is reliable) and we are ready to take it. I've read tons of resources over the past year or so and feel like I know most of what to expect. 

Unfortunately

Should we just take the whole tabs at one time or should we split them up by about an hour? Any of your other thoughts or wisdom is welcome! We have a great number of vinyls including Abbey Road and Revolver. :)
