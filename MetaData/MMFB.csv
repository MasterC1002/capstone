1366133141.0,1ch0xu,My best friend of 5 years raped me a week ago and hung himself last night...,Throwaway80122,148,14,68,"Well

Basically

About a week ago we were just finishing up our final assignments this year and we decided to get drunk and high at his apartment to celebrate. His roommate was out of town and nobody else was there. B talked me into drinking/smoking way too much and he ended up telling me that he loved me. I said that I was sorry but I didn't feel the same way, and I extracted myself and left.

I didn't tell anyone about it, and good friends with him might have made it seem less credible if I said anything. He texted me the following day apologizing and asking if we could talk about it, I didn't respond. He kept trying to contact me for a few days, and after ignoring him for so long I finally told him to leave me alone. He said he was sorry and that he wished he could take it back. 

Yesterday afternoon he texted me for the last time. He said ""I'm sorry about everything

It's afternoon now I've been crying in my room all day, and I feel horrible about it. Literally the last thing I ever said to him was ""fuck off."" The fact that we've been best friends since we were high school kids doesn't help matters. Also, he had depression/bipolar for years, and I don't think this will be heavily investigated because of his mental issues. I don't know if the texts to/from me are still in his phone or anything, I feel like I would have been questioned already if they were, but I have no clue. I'm still waiting for more news.

I have no idea what to do. I feel like I should tell the police, fucked up mistake, and he didn't deserve to die for it. I'm normally pretty well grounded emotionally, but I just feel so torn up about everything and don't know who to talk to about this.

My dad was diagnosed 2 years ago with a Frontal-lobe brain tumor, and well, I just found out 4 hours ago that he passed away, and I really don't know what to do...

The day before yesterday, living with us, and one graduated and married) to go to school,

I went to check on him and I found him heavily snoring, so i lifted his head on the pillow and woke my mom and told her, i tried to wake him, but i noticed he wasn't responding, then he still was snoring, she told me to left it more, but i noticed there was something wrong, and it turned out that he had a seizure again...

So, and it was absolutely horrifying, and we called an ambulance and such, anyway, and 7 months ago, he had Pneumonia and thromboses, and was in the hospital for 3 months, I thought he was gonna pass away in both of those times, he turned out to have had cerebral hemorrhage and tumor recurrence

It really hurts, that I won't see him again, I've accepted that he was eventually going to pass away, but, I don't know, it still feels like a terrible kick in the guts, and i really want to cry

I was staying with my aunt since i had to go to school that day because there was something really important, so I couldn't go and see him, and suddenly 4 hours ago they show up (My mom and 2 brothers) at the door, and they sit down and such, my mom's eye was kinda red, I felt there was something wrong, and my oldest brother told me to ""let's come and sit down"", and he wanted me to sit down again

I didn't cry or anything, and well, I am, and the burying is tomorrow, funeral is the day after...

But I'm just thinking, I wake up tomorrow and see in the State News or through an email alert that this girl got hypothermia or wandered into the street or something else horrifying like that.

So me being me, are you okay?  Do you need me to call anybody for you?""  At first she says she's fine, but I can tell she's not because she immediately trips again.  She has a visible and very bad scrape on her right knee from it.  I call out again, ""Do you need help?""  This time she says yes.

So I go up to her and I try to be really calm and friendly, and she puts her arm around my shoulders to help her stay upright.  ""Can you help show me where you live?""  She says she lives in Cedar Creek, it's a shitty little neighborhood of apartments right by my dorm, but about a mile away from where we're standing right then.

So we start walking and she's still tripping a lot.  She's visibly bleeding on my new jeans that I got for Christmas... but jeans are replaceable.  Whatever.  But let's focus on the important things.  She complains that she's cold.  It is pretty cold out, ""You're going to be fine.  We're going to get you back home and when you wake up you'll feel a lot better.""

She's crying and crying about how much of an asshole her boyfriend is.  She even starts asking me why I, ""I saw you fall and I was worried about you.""  She says that guys don't do that.  I joke, ""I'm an English major, we're naturally effeminate.""  I'm trying to cheer her up because she's really upset.  Then she totally wipes out and drags me with her.  My jacket gets really dirty.  I'm freezing my ass off in 30 degree weather in nothing but a t-shirt and jeans with another human being's blood dripping onto all of it.

1314519988.0,jwvlt,Girlfriend of 15 months died.  I am 17 years old; she was 16.  MMFB,throwaway931218,80,5,25,"This is a long story

My girlfriend Sofia and I actually met on an online game.  We became fast friends and chatted regularly, and within a week we were hooked.  We've had our ups, downs, and everything in between, but overall we had a very mature and real relationship.  It just wasn't something you'd expect from teenagers.

Neither of us would have let anything go beyond friendship if we did not live near each other.  It was just a matter of luck that we did live within two hours of each other.   We began making phone calls

Sofia had a rough past and had an undiagnosed disease killing her for years, late and very painful periods, very swollen lymph nodes, frequent infection and fever, everything under the sun, really.  She saw doctor after doctor and received referral after referral.  Tons of medications.  Nothing seemed to get her better.

She was nearly raped when she was in kindergarten

I was the reason Sofia was still fighting to live.  She didn't smile a lot because she was always in pain, even when she's trying not to because her stomach hurt when she laughed.

I can honestly say that even though we are so young, if nothing else.  We treated each other like husband and wife anyway.

We did eventually start having (safe) sex - both each other's firsts.  This happened for multiple reasons.  We knew we were going to be on the aisle with each other one day, while she still could.  Lastly, she wanted to give me every part of herself that she could before anything happened to her.  It turned out to be a great pain reliever, better than any medicine she was on.  It's also the most happy and carefree I ever saw her.  It's really amazing, being able to replace someone's pain with love like that.

After a slow degradation of her health, and I accepted that - but it still doesn't take the pain away.  She was such an innocent person, truly just that cute, innocent girl who never deserved an ounce of pain.  It killed me to see her in pain every day.  It was so unfair to her.  My only consolation is that she is no longer hurting.

I'm so lost right now

1368153169.0,1e1mkd,Today I witnessed a horrible event...,grantthejester,80,8,25,"Today I was witness to a horrible event:

Selling Auto parts is usually a healthy dose of troubleshooting, there isn't a whole lot of excitement. Actually, most days when the stocking work is done, and the customers are sparse, we tend to watch the traffic. So like many other days, we were watching the traffic, waiting for the next customer to call or drive up, and he was fed up. ""What a jerk"" we agreed

A moment later, the assistant manager working with me, and head out the door to investigate.
  
I was two seconds out the door, holding the non-responsive body of an infant in her arms.  I immediately told Shane to call 911, that there was a baby here that was not breathing. He dials the phone, and I rush back outside with one thought repeating in my head. ""Please don't let it be dead, please don't let it be dead... please, please don't let it be dead.""

I locked eyes with her and in a moment that I will never forget, and a helplessness which like a spark, jumped right to me, knocking the bottom out of my stomach. And she pleaded with me, baby in her arms, to help her, to do something.

It was a realization of every parent's worst fear

There's a wide variety of crying, but pure primal emotion.  It jolts the heart, floods the system with adrenaline, and puts you right to the very edge; capable of anything. I never fully understood the stories of mothers lifting cars off their children until I heard that sound.

The 911 disbatcher is giving Shane instructions, and so is the mom's arm and hands. She starts to bring her child inside, but doesn't want to leave her three year old son who is in the back seat.

I help the little guy get out of his car seat, it's delicate presence there, rendering all the commerce meaningless.

What happens next I will swear happened in the span of what seemed like less than a minute. The mom say's it's a little girl. Shane on the phone with 911 and confirmed that she has a heartbeat. We turn her on her side, but more keeps coming.

""Just take a deep breath... everything is going to be fine

I touch the baby's hand

""I heard a gurgling it sounded like she had spit-up. I reached back to clean her up

And as she's saying this I don't remember watching her say these words

Sometime during this

Two more labored breaths go by.

The police arrive. They are there maybe ten seconds when an Ambulance blazes into the parking lot

An EMT practically sprints in, ""Which hospital!""

""Childrens!""

http://i.imgur.com/KTeqfl7.jpg

I manage to snap this picture before the ambulance burns rubber down the street. The police help the woman lock her car

...   
   
""Do we have any disinfectant?""   
""There's some in the bathroom...""   
   
...   
   
I clean up the blood from my counter as the store sits in a stunned silence.

I remember selling people parts for the rest of the day, gasping for breath. I'm going to remember that image forever. I remember the color of the one-sie she had on, pink and blue flowers with lime green trim.

The police came back later. ""She was alive, in case they needed to hear what I'd seen. As they're asking questions the crime lab rolls up to take pictures.

It occurred to me later that this sort of evidence gathering is standard

The more I thought about it

I was out of milk.

Later, which may have been drastically cut short. The birthdays, the graduations, the late night study sessions and messy morning making Christmas cookies... all violently ripped out of time, never to exist. Suddenly and for no reason a happy healthy baby girl was taken away from her parents, after only three weeks of being alive. A completely helpless, innocent life... The injustice of the whole thing suddenly fell on my shoulders

And as I retell it now, and dance, and have chocolate cake... and never ever take her life for granted. I hope so much that she's ok...

I'm sorry if this is more personal than what I normally put on here

**tl;dr: I watched a newborn baby almost die on the counter at work.**

And thanks for what you said two days ago about claiming that if you didn't yell at me I wouldn't know right from wrong. Because telling me I'm a sissy little piece of shit really helps me develop morals. 

OH! Also thanks for the times you told me I was the runt of the family. That really helped me. And thanks for that time when you saw me about to hang myself and told me to go downstairs to eat.

And thanks for the times you woke me up in the middle of the night to yell at me. Oops

Thanks for making me scared as shit of men.

Thanks for making me terrified of coming back home from school.

Thanks for telling me to hide my thumb as a kid because you thought it was ugly.

I miss my mom. We had a really difficult relationship growing up and we had just managed to repair our relationship when we found out that she had stage 4 lung cancer. We got two months of complete happiness with one another. I would help her out; take her to her doctor appointments, come over and cook for her and take her garbage out and clean her apartment. I brought her presents - a necklace, one that she loved especially, and one that I am wearing now.

Instead of being able to call my mom in the middle of the night

I knew she was dead the night before I found her body. I called her and asked her to get online so we could chat. She said she would

I came over the next day after therapy fully expecting the worst, blood leading from the kitchen to the living room, culminating in a giant mess of blood underneath of her, in her chair, where she passed out from blood loss and died. 

I can't get the image out of my head. I can't get that video out of my head

1332524816.0,ra8z0,About being a victim of sexual violence and male,TheJollyGingerGiant,59,8,10,"Being a male and a victim of sexual violence has been a difficult thing for me to face in this world. Guys just don't talk about things like this where I come from. A small midwestern town in the USA. However

While at University I went to a party with a girl I was dating. I didn't know anyone but her there. We split up and said we'd meet up later on and I was having a nice time

 I had a nice conversation with a man and ironically talked about dating and Love. He was from a foreign country, good looks and a nice car, but wanted to know why women wouldn't date him. I told him not to worry and that he doesn't want to find a woman that is after all those things. That he should be patient and the right one would come to him... He seemed receptive and we exchanged contact information so I could help him with his English and that we could establish a friendship. I feel I made a great friend that day. Still do. He was a very nice man amidst a crowd of what turned out to be, very disturbed people.  We had been drinking pretty heavily and I was a little out of sorts, but nothing I'd consider dangerous... Certainly felt I had my wits about me... Last I remember was someone coming out giving us shots of vodka, then... black..... 

Before that I'd never not remembered going to bed and only one time after that, told her I needed to leave and blacked out. My friend brought me back to her place and I apparently puked all night long.... So, I've been drugged twice and luckily, only the first time resulted in rape. 

Back to that night....   After that shot of vodka, I am guessing it took two people to bring me there... I was brought up to the third floor, into my apartment, and then raped. I was 20 years old.... 
From the looks of the aftermath I've concluded that it was indeed by 2 individuals... I woke up to a horror scene. I was slumped over the end of my bed with my pants halfway down my thighs. Feces was on the floor and in my underwear. There was vomit all over the bed and nightstand and the smell still brings me back to that day...my hemorrhoids being as bad as they are right now, just thinking about it can bring up the odor. It is like reliving that experience...

 In a daze I walked towards the bathroom to try to get sorted out. I was in shock. My body was shaking and I felt on the brink of passing out...I felt cold and my skin was pale white when I looked into the mirror upon entering the bathroom. Looking down at the sink, puked in my sleep and left a huge stinking mess in the apartment and left my door open for him to see.... The note said things like, hey SHITTY roommate, you need to clean your SHITTY mess up. This is a bunch of bullSHIT and you smell like SHIT you scummy SHITbag. the note went on with every word SHIT being in large letters. This didn't help me any and I immediately found myself crawling into a shell... It was surreal. Like I was in some sort of twisted movie... 

After standing in the bathroom for a few minutes in disarray, the truth of what I was seeing, feeling and smelling, I stumbled out and went into the kitchen. What couldn't get any worse, did, as I found a dried pool of blood and what appeared to be dried ejaculate on the kitchen floor. After reading the letter and then seeing this I decided that I couldn't possibly tell anyone about what had happened. I was a college athlete. No way would anyone respect me if I said anything about this...

As if in some nightmare I just began to clean everything up. It took a few hours... First cleaning the feces off of the floor in my bedroom. Then taking my soiled and stained underwear, I then took a shower to try to wash away what couldn't be washed away in the shower.... Feeling my collapsed and tattered butthole in utter disbelief I began to wonder... Why did this happen to me?? How? What have I done to deserve this?

I thought that since I had told some friends and family that I FELT like I was Jesus amidst a very intense spiritual experience the summer before I was raped

Then, clothing and nightstand so I had to take everything down to the laundry room on the first floor. Then, I washed my nightstand and alarm clock. 

After that

 I never told anyone about this until about 3 months ago... To be mentioned is I have terrible hemorrhoids because of it and it has been my reminder of that night/following day

 After finally speaking about it I feel I have finally been able to grow again and have been able to fully forgive them. I understand that they must have had something bad happen to them in their life that they would do something like that to me... I feel lighter now... I've met and know what it's like to have friends that have experienced things like this. All the people I've spoken with at this point are women and I haven't met any men to talk with about this... I feel that my women friends that have also gone through this, have been so kind and helpful to me. The tears that came amidst coming out about this have been the only waters that have been able to wash the stains of that day from my heart..

 I know there are more women out there and I'm certain there are men out there

Also, and it seems, it is directly related to talking about it for the first time. Fascinating how the mind and body is so connected.

I'd also like to mention that I don't feel that the friend I made that night had anything to do with it. I don't even think he knew about it even though it was his friends' party. 

He had called me a few weeks later to see what I was up to. I was going to see some family so I was unable to meet up with him... I was also still reeling with the fact of what happened and wasn't exactly ready to go spend time with him either though...I wasn't ready to face that music yet... I just hope that if he found out about it

 I also no longer blame the two men that did this to me. They have far greater problems to face than I do. I just pray that they can find peace in their hearts and forgive themselves for what they've done. I've forgiven them. They aren't holding me down any longer...

I also don't want my former roommate or his girlfriend to feel bad. They didn't realize what had happened. They just thought the wild child had finally gone too far. They've both been through the toughest times of my life with me and I Love them dearly. 

Amidst it all, Once I began to tell my story and others extended compassion to me, this is when I stared to find real Peace..... I am ready to go out into the world now :-)

My Name is Louis and I hope this helps someone out there. Thank You for Listening. Feel free to share with me. I'd be honored to help.

In a new relationship but struggling to deal with it.


I met my husband when I was 18, but kept it together on the surface, because I had no choice, and babies are a good distraction. People would tell me they couldn't believe I was coping so well, when actually I wasn't at all. Just kept up the facade and tried to get on with it. The first 2 years afterwards I was just numb, did what I had to do and avoided dwelling on my feelings. Once I started to feel a little less numb, I completed a college course and got accepted for a degree course. But during this time I was also seeking out comfort in the wrong places, ensuring I didn't get too close to anyone.

6 months ago that all changed, have suddenly hit me. I feel like I'm right back in the first stages of it again. I've quit uni. I'm unintentionally distancing myself from my boyfriend. I've distanced myself from most of my friends and family, I'm avoiding contacting or seeing anyone. I can't talk to them about it anyway, no one really understands, and I don't expect them to. I just feel down, really hopeless. Like no matter what I do, what changes I make in my life

Lately my son, tried to ensure he knows he can talk to me, but 4 year olds aren't too great at sharing how they feel about difficult situations. He has said it makes him sad that his Daddy is dead, and that he loves him. He's recently become quite anxious about death, probably 2-3 times a week he'll say that he doesn't want me to die. I've been honest, and admitted that everyone does die, but it won't happen for a really long time, and discussing his Dad's death really

I'm really confused about where to go from here. I had stupidly thought I was over the worst, and I don't want to spend the rest of my life in this limbo. I'm going to see if my doctor can refer me for counselling, but I find opening up to anyone so difficult, that I'm not sure how much it'll help me. I don't know what to do about my current relationship, whilst there are small niggles in the relationship itself, the main issue is me, my past, or if it's fair to drag him into it. He is, if I try to maintain the relationship and fail

1336375303.0,tavbk,"I want to fucking kill my ""uncle""",mooningduck,54,14,26,"**Sorry this is so long but it is an interesting story I promise**

I wasn't raped

In November two years ago

A year prior

Fast-forward a year and its Nov and I'm at his house. Every night he had wanted me to sleep IN HIS BED WITH HIM. Keep in mind im a fucking sixteen year old girl. I can handle my own shit and can sleep on a couch ALONE. So I was firm and did not sleep with him. But the last day I was there

He flipped.

Once I hung up he screamed at me for what was about 45 minutes. He made me call my grandma and tell her I wasn't going to see her. The whole way home (we were visitng colleges) he told me I was stupid

Sorry this isn't written well but I'm just spewing out shit as it comes to me. I think I should also mention that he was fired from his job at a children's amusement park for inappropriate behavior with a young teenage girl (not consensual obviously). 

Anyway

Of course I started to cry and his whole demeanor changed. He asked why I was crying (WTF?) and asked if it was because of my parent's current separation (it wasn't). I got up to leave and I swear I have never seen anyone move as fast as he did. **He sprinted to his bedroom door and blocked the way.** 

Right then I knew I was in deep shit. I tried to stay calm as I went to my suitcase and started packing my things. He walked away from the door and (ill never forget this. its the most terrifying thing that has ever happened to me) I just remember seeing his two huge feel cluck loudly on my left side and noticing the detail of his shoelaces as I hear him say **""If you think you're going anywhere

I remember thinking that there was no way in hell that was going to be my last memory as a virgin or just being alive. I took my chance and scrambled to the door. He grabbed at my ankle and I kicked and ran downstairs. I grabbed a knife and ran outside and was soaked instantly. My phone was in my pocket so I took it and called my dad. I stood right under a streetlight so if there was anyone they could see me and help. I was sobbing and screaming but the storm was so loud no one heard. I thought I was going to die and it felt like a horror movie.

My dad answered on the third try, but he never steered me wrong, so I went back in. He asked to talk to Jesse, so I gave him the phone. They argued for a minute or two, and then he gave me my phone back. My dad told me to go get my stuff and go straight to grandma's and that Jesse would not stop me. I did just that. 

As I was trying to leave

That is the last time I have heard his  voice.

He sent me a text a few months later claiming he has ""*too much glib for his own good*"". WHAT THE FUCK?! fuck that. 

**But this part takes the cake**. In March 2011, staring me down. His legs were spread in a power-stance with his hands on his hips. He was leering and grinning and destroying me with his eyes all at the same time. My stomach dropped and my legs went numb. I didn't know what to do but I wasn't about to make a scene in my grandfather's final moments. I kissed my grandpa and said goodbye and left. 

I will never NEVER forgive him for that. I can't forgive myself. He stole my last chance to tell my grandpa I loved him. I completely forgot because of the shock of seeing Jesse. I lost 7 family members in the past 3 years and this death is the only one I really cannot get over. I think about my grandpa weekly and I think of the ordeal with Jesse multiple times a day. I have tried to tell my parents about this but they jsut don't seem to understand. They show they care

Am I over-reacting? I feel like shit all the time since that November. I can't trust any guys and I just hate myself. Thanks for reading all this if you did.

TL;DR My dad's best friend is a molester (probably a rapist if he got the chance) but didn't get the chance to get me. But I feel very violated and cannot get over it two years later.

1367654864.0,1do4jt,Raped by best friend. He was found guilty. Sentencing hearing happening soon. Everyone hates me.,seeohseeoh,47,2,19,"Ok.

I was raped by my best (male) friend after talking with him about me being a lesbian. He admitted it to the police the next morning because he felt guilty. I saw his confession

He also sexually assaulted my sister 3 years ago. None of us turned him in because he was young and we wanted to show him love and help him by being supportive. We all started talking openly about sex with him. Not in a graphic way, love, biology, and how they often intertwine. We were young then, too, and thought that we could ""save"" him.

The sentencing hearing is in a week. All but 2 of our mutual friends have turned their backs on me. His family believes that I am intentionally lying to avoid admitting to a relationship with him. He even admitted at trial that he knew I was a lesbian, in the court room he said that I manipulated him into it.

Somehow people think that he is telling the truth. I understand why they do... I mean, 'It's because he's afraid of facing prison.' So, we offered him plea bargains (each with no prison time- just house arrest) but he denied them. He kept telling everyone that I was a selfish and manipulative person.

All I wanted was for him to be forced to go through therapy (individual and family) and drug rehab (he has been overly sexual with quite a few women while high). I just wanted him to get help. I wanted to show him that not all women will take things like this quietly and roll over. I loved him too much to want him to go to prison. I still do. Maybe that's stupid of me


I just feel insane. I hate this. The betrayal is more than I can handle. I can't stop loving him. I want to, but I still have so much guilt. I wonder if we were too open with him about sex. I regret not bringing his problems to light 3 years ago after he assaulted my sister. We all just loved him too much. But love wasn't enough. It was a hard lesson. I feel like the world is slowly crushing me. We're in a small town and I see his family and friends driving past me all the time. I want to scream. I want to punch the wall over and over. I want to turn back time. I believe I did the right thing, but I also can't help but hate myself for turning him in. He confessed, and he admitted it (which is the only reason he was found guilty in court), but it doesn't make it hurt any less.

I miss my best friend. The nostalgia is constantly breaking me a part. I have no friends anymore because he convinced them I lied. That's not an exaggeration. The only people I see are the girls from group therapy and my family. I feel like I didn't do enough to help him. And I'm confused... I can't seem to grasp what happened. It's been over a year, even after he hurt me... but then he just kept on ripping me a part. They always tell you to report things like this, but the trial process is hell. It's hell and they hate me and my best friend is convincing people I've never even met that I'm a liar and he's writing letters to the Governor about his innocence and his mother is bad mouthing me and I'll never get to hug his little sister again or eat dinner with his parents or sit in his back yard singing songs or drive through the back roads late at night talking about life and love and our place in all of this.

She is very religious, and when she is near blackout, I often hear about the meadow that she needs to get to.

I am, leaving this earth wouldn't have been so difficult for her. She could finally escape the pain without too much trouble and fear.

We haven't had the best of relationships recently. She complains that I don't make enough to support the family (even though I work two jobs and make over 75K). She's started babysitting a few days a week

So now I have to go home, but I won't sit still if this relationship is going to continue. She has already involved our kids in this. She took the older two to a company picnic with the douche on Sunday, while telling me it was a party the kids were invited to. When I asked the kids later whose party it was, they looked scared and didn't know how to answer. Also, my three year old told me randomly - ""Daddy, I don't like mommy's friend Mark""

So I guess I could just use a little support. I'm weak, but also knowing that she has a verbally volatile tendency and is doing her best to avoid me just now. 

I also need the strength to not go cut the guys brakes

Thanks for listening...

EDIT: Thanks for the continued support. I've been tired and frustrated and confused, and she moves back and forth between wanting to work it out, and giving me shit. She was abused heavily as a kid, so I understand where some of her issues come from. But it doesn't excuse all of the issues she's showing recently. 

Lately, and my general reaction is to just give in to make her happy, or take her pain onto myself.

I don't know what I want. But it's killing me. I've been so depressed and isolated. I want friends badly - she's basically separated me from having friends, who I am. I want to have intimacy. Not just sex (although I miss that terribly), but conversation, love, etc. I'm not sure what my next step is. She can't leave, and she knows it. Her quality of life would diminish greatly. So she continues taking advantage of me, knowing that I won't be the first to end it. 

I've been told by my therapist that I need to focus on making me happy, and I fret.

We met in October 2009 and started dating in November of that year. We moved in together in May 2010 and by July I got pregnant. This was our first child. When she was about 4 months we got married. 

As soon as he came home from work today I got everything ready to make dinner for him. I try to start a conversation with him, instead he took all of his things, EVERYTHING, and left. 

I dropped out of HighSchool and got my GED because he didn't want me to go to school. I lost my friends because he doesn't like them. I've done so many things for him and it seems like he doesn't care. I feel like this was a stupid reason for leaving. and I think he was just looking for an excuse to leave me.

My worries is not only that he left me. But before I met him I had planned to finish hs and move back to Mexico to go to college and live the rest of my life there.

As a child I would stare up at the stars through the window where I slept on an air mattress with my two other siblings and wish to be one of those kids who had food in the house and who got new toys and was allowed to have friends over. I was an awkward kid and my parents couldn't afford new clothes or braces so I was made fun of so much that the kids developed songs to sing while they chased me home and threw rocks at me.

Then as an adolescent the abuse really started to set in. My parents had always been good parents until circa 2006 when my mom went back to meth. It was a secret, my mom (being all tweeked out) would stay up for hours, banging on our doors and accusing us of stealing and doing drugs.

I met a man at my Mom's work who flirted with me and made me feel beautiful despite never even being kissed. At 14

After that whole fiasco, I dropped out of high school and ran away to the closest major city. I met a boy who cared for me and let me live with him. I love him desperately and he abused me physically and emotionally, cheated on me, and made me sleep in the car when he was mad because I had no where else to go.

Sometimes I'd look up at the stars from the backseat and wish that I had enough money to eat. I would get so hungry that I wouldn't be hungry and I wasted away to a very low weight. This went on until I was 18 and after catching him fucking another girl in the bathroom at a party

But we still lived together and it was easier to do that. When I found another boyfriend

So I moved out and went to live on a friend's couch while dating the new guy. I got a retail job but could never make ends meet and my boyfriend didn't work -at all- nor made any attempt to. I had to quit my job move up to my grandmother's house to avoid living on the street and he went with me. That was great for a little bit; my dad put money down for a down payment on a car and I was working full time.

Then that boyfriend broke up with me to leave one of my so-called ""friends"" and my bipolar set in -hard-. I couldn't breathe, I tried to kill myself at least 4 times. I still have the gashes where I cut down to the bone on my thigh. My grandmother died, leaving me her house and my Dad (who was separated from my Mom) lived in the master bedroom while I had a whole room to myself.

It was alright for a bit, having vivid dreams that I was a fairy-tale princess who was protected by dragons and my ex bf was a silly fairy prince. I started hearing the voices of things I thought were fairies or spirits but sometimes they would be dark and tell me to hurt myself.

Then came Toby (name has been changed). Toby changed my life forever. Toby was everything you'd ever want in a man: Tall, hung, stable, intelligent, funny, and as devoted to me as I was to him. He believed in my silly fairytale so much that he 'discovered' his own 'character'. We lived in my grandmother's house, my Dad loved him, mostly over money. I had a part time job but it only afforded me enough money to pay my car payment and cell phone bill. He had to buy food, it was the end of 2008 and I wasn't aware of the world outside my own.

Near Christmas he told me that he was planning to move closer to work so that our relationship could grow and heal. I bought that hook-line and sinker and watched him grow happier and happier as he got all settled in. I wanted to be happy for him but suddenly he wasn't returning my calls and he just didn't care anymore. In January

And then everything fell apart. The bipolar sent me into a hole that I had no hope of every crawling out of. I tried to kill myself several times in that empty house and my parents begged me to come home to be safe. I relinquished my ownership of my grandmother's house to my father and moved home. It was... okay... I would try half-assedly to find a job while my mom fed me pills and tried to help me back on my feet. Toby and I were kind of keeping touch and definitely still having sex.

I took a job as an exotic dancer after seeing pictures from a friend on FB of her being one and it looked so amazing. Suddenly I was losing weight and Toby was interested. He was impressed with how independent I was. It was the first time that I'd been completely financially independent and could buy whatever I wanted. I moved back into the city into my own place, he would 'settle' for me. This went on for a year. We would text all day, I would beg to see him, try to seduce him via text, act confident and independent, and when he called my bluff I would spiral down into a panicked depression. When we were together I was never allowed to talk about my feelings -that pushed him away-, if I wanted any time with him at all

The economy started taking its toll on the clubs, face down on the carpet and cutting all over my body. I wanted so badly to die. One day I decided I was going to end it. I looked online and purchased what I thought was cyanide. When it arrived, I told Toby and turned off my phone. To my surprise he showed up at my apartment and demanded that I go to an emergency room. I was starting to get a really bad tummy ache and I didn't want to pay for an ambulance so he drove me there. On the way I vomited all over his car and he missed his opportunity to go to Disneyland with a girl I didn't know he was seeing. He stayed me as long as he could; he watched them shove hoses down my nose and my mouth, my legs were shaking so violently and uncontrollably that I had to be physically restrained. They pumped my stomach and found that I had not been sold cyanide, that it had been something else (can't remember the name). A few hours later I was transferred to a behavioral clinic for 5150 but I talked my way out of it and was out the next day. They gave me Zoloft to start getting my bipolar taken care of and at first it actually worked! Everything felt like it was going to be okay. For my birthday Toby and I went to Vegas together. That week was amazing and I found out a few weeks after that that I was pregnant.

I was stoked. I wanted so badly to have something to keep him around and now I would have him for the rest of my life! He was so good to me, being a sweetheart and holding me as I fell asleep... I talked for hours about the baby name and how we would raise it and assumed that he agreed but a week later he told me it wasn't a good time in his life, or mine, that I should try to get my bipolar figured out and to be more stable. He promised me that if I had an abortion that A) we would freeze his sperm and try again in a few years and B) that he would start treating me better and get back with me.

In my state

Toby was wonderful during the aftercare. I felt so loved. It was the last time I would ever feel that way.

An exact week later he stopped talking to me. I didn't get it. He'd moved into an apartment in my complex so I sat outside his door and cried and begged and banged until he came out. He said he was disgusted with me and that the friend who had gotten me into stripping had told him all my dirty secrets. The drugs, happy to have a change in scenery and told Toby I was moving.

When I was finally all moved in, leading me to text him over and over again. I tried calling some more and finally a female picked up.

I thought I had called the wrong number but she informed me that she was his fiance and that I should really consider overdosing and just ending my pathetic life. I panicked and hung up. Then I hopped into my car and drove two hours to his apartment. On the way there he finally gave up and texted: ""Fine, twisting the words into me while he watched and ignored my pleas. I'll never forget how it felt...

I don't remember much... but I ended up back at home with my parents in a fucking pile of tears. My mother subdued me with an assortment of pills and I slept for a few days. When I woke up, all of my mom's pills and my exacto knives (My parents had hid them from me), climbed into the big, warm tub, and slashed my left wrist down to the bone. I remember pulling the tendon aside to keep cutting just in case I survived because it would have ruined my ability to use my left hand.

Apparently I passed out because when I woke up I was in the hospital

Someone actually listened to me. They told me it was okay to hurt, the world seemed brighter, seemed more alive. As I healed, the medication started to really take effect and I was headed into a manic phase. For about 6 months I was on top of the world. I learned how to skateboard, started smoking weed, quit the pills AND cigarettes, got in touch with old high school friends and even got to date a boy that didn't even know I existed in high school. Everything was wonderful.

Until he broke up with me and I was spiraling down again. I told him I was pregnant even though I wasn't, that you can do anything), and started taking pills again. I found out that Toby had, legitimately married the new girl a a month or so previously and I secretly hated them both for it. This went on for a few months and then I started to come back up. I struggled to get stabilized but I didn't have a solid foundation to do so. In October of that year my drug addict brother stole my car and totaled it. It wasn't even paid off yet but it now sits on my credit as a charge off. He never once tried to fix it but he was not to be trusted. He'd fucked over everyone in my family multiple times.

One night after feeling particularly suicidal, my room was in shambles; even my teddy bear had been pulled apart to search inside his stuffing.

I immediately called everyone I knew to get the fuck out of there. My very good friend's family invited me in but they live an hour and a half away. I decided to ditch everything, spent healthy time with the mom and sisters. It was like a real family but their dad had a temper and although he never EVER hit anyone, it made me really uncomfortable. They must have felt the same way because they informed me that they couldn't keep me there anymore.

Again I am panicking to find a place to live. I have no where to go. My ex got in contact with me randomly and asked if I wanted to spend the night again. I said yes and that night we talked about me living on his couch til I found a place. I was ecstatic. I moved the three boxes of my stuff I still had left over down to the city and hit the best manic phase I've ever been through. I was smoking weed a lot, skateboarding in the beautiful summer weather, and generally loving being free from emotional pain and my parents and my life.

I couldn't find a job though. I had only a skateboard to get around and a rapidly declining amount of money for public transportation and food. The money dwindled down until I had nothing. Once again I was wondering where my next meal would come from and that's scary shit. I lucked out one day and got an interview for an office job. The boss was incredibly understanding and took me in like a daughter; he bought me gifts, was fulling accepting of my bipolar and never ONCE tried to come on to me. Life was going good. I got a puppy, started biking to work and getting in shape, I had a few flings here and there and while the breakups still sucked, they were slowly but surely becoming less dramatic. I still lived in poverty but it was okay because the city was beautiful and I was hitting mania straight on.

I spent a lot of time deciding who I wanted to be. I dissected who I was and altered any parts I wasn't happy with. I would find parts I didn't like and just phase them out. I liked myself. I was proud of how far I'd come, like I had. I fed him, bought him clothes, smoked him out, didn't charge him rent and even found him a job. We were putting our family back together and making in work in a way that my parents had not done.

Last October I got back in touch with a boy I'd been in love with for many years but that had never been single until now. I thought it was meant to be -obviously because I had waited for him- but I instinctively knew that he wasn't over his ex and when he finally broke it off for that very reason

October, January, February, March... 6 months or depression. I gained weight, stopped working out, could barely get out of bed... I felt useless. I hadn't had a real relationship since Toby and I was starting to believe that I would always be single but half of me wanted that. I was terrified of ever loving someone again because of Toby. I had thought that this new guy was the one. I don't know why, I just knew

But I was wrong. And that disappointment sent me straight back into a 5150. At that point I had missed so much work that my boss had to let me go in January. I didn't care about anything. I was empty. I didn't shower regularly

Then suddenly I caught my brother with pills and coke. He'd been taking the money he was supposed to give me for rent and buying drugs. We had a knock-down drag out and I told him to get out. He then proceeded to tell everyone at his work that I had kicked him out for no reason. I found out that he had been using my car and acquire THREE parking tickets that were all overdue and in the hundreds. He'd been stealing cash from a private safe I had under the bed so I couldn't cover the rent that he owed me. He worked at the dispensary I bought from and convinced his boss to cut me off and cancel my membership.

Then I discovered bed bugs. I spent an entire paycheck hiring an exterminator. So much, again, I sleep on an air mattress.

The day of my birthday, baked for my big party and got high. A group of us went to set up the venue and I was SO excited. I left the rest of the stuff to people who were already dressed and ready to go and headed home to get all pretty for my birthday. Naturally it took forever but I felt beautiful. I was so happy and proud of myself. I imagined how dreamy my ball would be and when I got there....

Only the people who had helped put the party together were there.

60 people had RSVP'd and 3 of them actually showed up. I faked being happy and grateful all night because I didn't want to be rude to my guests but that night

And now we're here and I'm 15 days away from being homeless. Again. I have a car I can sleep out of but I don't qualify for unemployment since it was under the table. I am on food stamps now. I have $3 to my name and no opportunity for work. Not that it would matter. I'd work for a few months and then the bipolar would destroy me and I'd lose my job. That's just how my life works. I tried for disability but they view mania as a period of stability so it looks like I'm just sad when bad things happen and then I'm fine the rest of the time. It's an awful cycle.

I just want to be normal like everyone else. I want to be stable

I gained so much weight that none of my bras fit and they trap them painfully during the day because I can't afford to buy new ones. I've had to steal basics like deodorant, etc etc. I sleep on an air mattress with a slow leak and up until recently I was sharing a tiny bedroom with my brother. My car is falling apart; every time I turn her on I pray that the engine will start...

It gets me down that I live in poverty. I've tried so hard to grow and be a normal person but I have no control over this bipolar. I am at the mercy of my emotions and the voices of my tormentors in my head. I don't know what to do. I don't have any money to move

I haven't been depressed lately but last night was a tipping point. I went out with my roommate who plays baseball for the college and his baseball friends. I don't have any friends of my own in this town. To make matters worse, I'm fucking 25 years old and a combat veteran, but I'm marginalized in every conversation. 

To top it off, all though they were attractive enough. Everything they said was benign and trivial. One of the girls insulted my age and called me weird for not being like everyone else. Normally I value my weirdness, but lately I've been feeling more isolated than ever. I guess it was like a Gump kind of moment.

Anyways, but then seeing everyone in uniform makes me upset that I still have friends in Afghanistan and here I am in my boxers eating a fucking hot pocket. It makes me feel beyond worthless.

I don't know if I would qualify myself as suicidal as of this moment, I could find other methods, but I'm trying to keep myself positive. Typing all this out has actually helped.

1353164365.0,13cpci,Dad Unexpectedly Died,stay_sea,43,4,19,"It's been about a month since my dad died unexpectedly at the age of 56.  My parents were vacationing out on the west coast (We're from Indiana) celebrating their 30th wedding anniversary.  They were having a blast just talking and planning out the next 30 years together.

They were driving along in Oregon when he just died of a heart attack.  My mom had to get down on the floor of the car to somehow stop the car.  I seriously have no idea how she survived since they swerved from the right lane

My older brother and I got the call at 6 pm on a Friday.  We were preparing to leave town to go to a wedding.  That weekend was basically suppose to be a little vacation and really fun.  Instead we flew out to Oregon to get our Mom.  She was all alone for almost 24 hours since we have no family out there.  I just feel so awful for my mom cause they loved each other so much.  I had a boring, but they got through everything.  They started and ended each day with a kiss and ""I love you.""  They set very high standards for what I expect in relationships.

We got Mom home and started planning the funeral and viewing.  It seemed, I'll be sitting at home and he'll walk in like always.  My family and close friends have been great, but a little overbearing.  It was always the 4 of us.  I'm not particularly close with extended family, but I always knew I had my Mom, Dad and brother to help me.  So them asking what they can do to help, and we tell them serious things like ""Blow leaves"" or ""Mow the grass"", and they just laugh at us

The viewing seemed so weird.  My dad was in the trucking industry so quite a few people came to it that we've never met in real life.  Or if we have

The funeral was even harder.  My parents are Catholics (converted a couple years ago so I am not) so we had a mass.  It was so weird.  Mom chose to sit in the middle of us kid instead of the end of the pew next to Dad.  I could barely look the my right because I was next to him.  I half expected him to sit up and ask why everybody is crying.  Father did a wonderful service.  Made it very accessible to us non Catholics.  Explained the symbolism of his actions at the end.  He also incorporated talking about Dad's habits (Same church pew

The church had a luncheon afterwards because we chose to bury Dad in his hometown instead of the one I grew up in.  The luncheon was really great.  Got to talk to my step grandma about Dad and Grandpa.  It took us forever to get in contact with her.  Dad was her favorite of his siblings (don't tell them that though) so we knew we had to find her.  I was the one that broke the bad news sadly.  She's a postal worker so I called her post office and left a message.  Common sense just tells you that when you are hearing from me instead of Dad in regards to him

The burial was next.  I don't know how we got through it honestly.  It was a short ceremony, Mom couldn't leave.  All my family members kept badgering her to leave and she just couldn't stand up and leave Dad.  I stayed by her side and played defense as best as I could.  I understood completely.  She just needed time before she could leave her soulmate behind to be buried.  So I stayed next to her holding her hand until she found the strength to stand up and leave.

And then life had to continue on.  My brother, places, etc).  It was great.  Kept my brother and I busy and distracted for that night.  Our friends turned up in force and made sure we had a good time.

Real world beckoned us to return.  My brother worked with my dad in the business they ran together.  So he's running that now all by himself.  I come into help on my day off.  Mom always did the books so she still does that.  I think it'll survive.  Dad built it and so we are keeping it alive.  I had to returned to my job that Tuesday.  Everybody kept mentioning that Dad bragged about my job.  I just graduated from college and this is my first real job.  Everybody knew about it.  He was so proud of me.  He always always bragging about what job interviews I was going on and how I graduated college unlike most of my family.  

It just seems so unfair.  Why him?  Why now?  I feel so selfish for thinking of things he's going to miss out on.  Like, I knew he'd be there and catch me.  Now I don't have that net. 

I want to make him proud.  I want to hear his voice again.  I want to have one more hug from him.  I'm trying not get buried in regrets

I go to a small private high school so we dont have all of the ""staple"" events that the average high school has. For example, because of the lack of events at our school, a lot of students at my school go to the events at other schools. And once they make a connection with someone from that school, they get invited to their personal house parties too. But i just get so frustrated by that, because no matter how many friends i have at this school, i never get invited to the big parties. And at my own school i actually am very well-liked, and i do have a few friends at other schools, but now i just feel so alienated. But then some people actually threw a BIG community-wide, but i never paid any attention to it (basically tried to ignore it). But now ever since ive been introduced to masturbation and pornography (as most boys my age that i know do), and i want to keep this post focused on it. And ive already typed out so much! So please

1343675707.0,xem3k,21 year old alcoholic here. I'm poor and scared. I have health problems. I don't know how much longer I can make it. I am also scared for my cats.,littledorgan,41,5,11,"Hi Reddit. I thought about doing an AMA


Here's a little bit about me


I discovered my mom was an alcoholic when I was 14. That's when her abuse started. Usually not physical (only got  physical if I shouted back at her). She frequently told me I was the worst mistake she ever made and I wasn't worth the  air I breathe. I had to hide from her. She worked at a newspaper company until she got laid off about a year before I ran  away. The job had late hours, naked. She would have sex  loudly with strange men when I was home. She was a monster and I hate her.


(Cool story before I continue: when I was 19 I was contacted and told she was put into treatment. I went and got all of her things worth saving [the house was actually condemned and moved her into my apartment building, I paid her rent for 3 months, then she moved in with me [she still had no job] started drinking, fucked some shit up, moved in with an old dude and since then I have cut off contact with her.)


This abuse continued until I dropped out of highschool at 16 and ran away at 17 to Minneapolis from the small town we  were living in. I had saved up $300 from the burger-slinging job I had been working at. It was going to be my first  month's rent money living with a girl I knew from highschool named Kelly. The dude Kelly was fucking found it and stole  it. Since he was a scary gangster I was unable to confront him about it.


Fast forward a little bit


I feel like I should mention here I was severely anorexic from ages 15-18. Then I put on like 45 pounds. At that point I  was still getting periods


So after a while Minneapolis just got to expensive. I didn't want to see my friends anymore or do anything fun or even  leave the house to get groceries because I was so ashamed of my weight. I was at 145lb and I'm only 5' tall. So I became  a hermit. I couldn't look people in the eye when I worked. I decided to move to Des Moines where it would be cheaper
 

Once in Des Moines, lost ALL the weight I had gained, got REALLY happy (seriously I love being skinny) and met my boyfriend there (he  was 17 I was 19. Not THAT creepy) and quit. 


I then got a job at a coffee shop. Things are going okay. I am happy. I love my new boyfriend


In the beginning


Eventually I got promoted to manager at the coffee shop. Nice pay increase, couldn't be happier). Things are good, except at  work. The job is hellaciously stressful. I was working 72 hour weeks. I got no overtime or support from the DM's. I  stayed at that job for over a year, but I decide to cut my losses and go work at target. Things are still okay, but  financially a little shakey. My boyfriend is still not living with me.


Then in walks the biggest sociopath douchebag on the fucking planet. He was a regular at my coffee shop and he manages  the concert venue just down the street from my store. His assistant just quit. He asks me to come work for him. I'm  fucking stoked! It's going to be so awesome! He's such a nice guy!! Wrong. So fucking wrong.


In the beginning it was great. Goin to work at 9:30 and getting off at 5 everyday! Just answer the phones, sell tickets...easy! Sure I have to stay late if there is a concert, but whatevs. I get to watch TV  and drink beer. :)


Well

that stupid fatass cuts my pay down to $9/hr! 


I realize I need to get the fuck out of there before it kills me. So I apply at a new coffee shop (the last one closed  down a month after I quit. The place fucking FELL APART WITHOUT ME) and BOOM get hired! Woohoo!


Now we're pretty close to the present. I got hired about 2 months ago (actually my first day was May 31st). So far things  have been...a little better...but the money is running out. I started writing bad checks to get food when my account was  overdrawn. Now I'm getting a bunch of collection letters and the major grocery stores all have me on their ""bad check  list"" (their system won't take my checks... I didn't even know that could happen...). We are constantly out of food. All  I can think about is getting drunk to ease the pressure on my chest


My boyfriend can't find a job (he lives with me btw, but I've taken  good care of him. I bought him fun things when times were good... 


The end of my story is this: They only scheduled me ONE DAY THIS WEEK. ONE FUCKING DAY! 7.5 hours! I don't know what I am  going to do. I am so scared. Someone please help me.

Just the other day

It took me back a minute, but I've spent hours listening to her.. Letting her cry on my shoulder. Trying to console her through her pain. When she needed me, I drove 30 miles to be with her for as long as she needed. 

So, etc etc. But when it comes down to the very few times I feel like spilling the beans, it just confirms my beliefs. Nobody cares, unless it's about them.

This really breaks my heart and makes me want to withdraw further, either. Not that it's a huge problem because the pro's outweigh the con's when it comes to him.

But I'm going through a very hard time right now

This doesn't make sense.. I'm an outgoing, I'm very nice.. Maybe overly nice sometimes. I'm talented, interesting. I'm not mopey and I have a lot to offer. Why am I so alone?

I can't talk to my mother about the way I feel, he's just so ridiculous that a serious of events have landed him in jail. (He's actually there on his own will.)

My brother is autistic.. Good luck getting him to listen to me.

So

The worse part? I even want to brag sometimes.. Through all this shit I'm going through, of course.) The morels are popping up around my house and I LOVE to cook with them.. Doesn't anybody want to hear about how good mushrooms that grow behind my shed are? FUCK.

So

Well, it would be appreciated to know somebody takes a small amount of interest in what I have to say.

1323368591.0,n53um,I'm finally beating my depression. Maybe I can MYFB.,CaptainPlatypus,40,1,16,"I've been talking about this with a lot of people, but I was uncomfortable taking medication. No problem

He wasn't joking. The past four months have more or less been hell. I wasn't sleeping. I wasn't going out and doing anything - I spent nearly all my time at work, but it wasn't easy, it wasn't pretty, and not all aspects of my life went so well. I wasn't taking care of myself - the apartment I was more or less sharing with my girlfriend was filthy, our relationship was going downhill fast, and my normally hyperactive sex drive was more or less nonexistent.

The relationship is worth more discussion, the only thing holding me together. I'd come home from a shitty day, and she'd cuddle me and make it less shitty. Not better - nobody could have done that - but less shitty. It wasn't a healthy relationship for a long time, though. I wasn't capable of doing my part in ANY way, because the depression was just screwing me up that badly. Every single ounce of energy I had was going towards trying to get my head on straight and trying not to have my life utterly collapse out from under me while I did so, and there wasn't any left for her.

I wasn't dating a complete pushover, but we weren't communicating well (one of us was depressed) and so the fights weren't often on topic. We were also both very reluctant to break up with the other, me because I was basically using her as a lifeline (and yes, I feel guilty about that) and her because of past problems that aren't my story to tell. So things kept going downhill, because it was an unhealthy relationship and it wasn't ending. Finally, things came to a head last week. She cheated on me with a friend of hers.

Since I'm a terrible storyteller, in case anyone needs help finding one, and who was open to helping me regardless of financial situation, though my parents gave me some help there) is what's known as a cognitive behavioral therapist. I told him all about what was happening and how I was feeling, and he would ask me about how I was thinking. Once he had a good picture of my mental processes, we talked a lot about how many of them were not only inaccurate but self-defeating, and how I wasn't thinking about life in a wholly realistic way. He gave me a lot of help replacing those with more realistic, and healthy ones, I was seriously contemplating it because I was sick of feeling bad and wanted to do something about it.

Anyway, and thankfully called me directly afterwards to tell me about it. Then the weirdest thing happened. I felt hurt, sure, and I felt REALLY disappointed in her, because she's better than that. But it didn't crush me. It didn't make me feel horrible. I was able to keep functioning, even though I felt really hollow inside and frankly not very great at all. I told her I was breaking up with her but that I didn't hate her or want her to feel horrible, hung up the phone

The rest of that day...was rough. I had a ton of stress in my life already, I went home at the end of the day and I got a good night's sleep. I woke up the next morning feeling better, but still rough, so I called in to work sick (feeling bad about that, of course, mainly because I've done it so much thanks to the depression) and stayed home.

That day was better, but I'd made a lot of progress in therapy, and I kept telling myself that feeling guilty over how I felt was unproductive, that wallowing in guilt wasn't solving anything, and that the best thing I could do was just accept things for the way they were and move on in a healthy fashion. And the strangest thing is that it actually worked. Not just in terms of convincing myself that that was the case - for a while, I'd been getting that far, but it wouldn't make me feel better, I got back in touch with some friends I hadn't talked to in way too long. I made a profile on OKCupid

The next day, or had a day that I felt good for the majority of, in months - but neutral, which is nice enough when you're used to feeling like shit all day. And that stayed with me all day. I did a bit more cleaning. I made some plans with friends and with strangers online. I stayed in control of my thoughts, and managed to delete some compromising photos of my girlfriend and myself from my phone without feeling awful or collapsing or contemplating doing anything less than completely honorable. The last, thankfully, is par for the course

Then monday came. I woke up early - which never happens - and the strangest thing was that I woke up feeling GOOD. Actively optimistic, I realized something. A redditor I know, who was depressed and on medication, had described the day he started taking meds as waking up and going ""oh hey, this is how OTHER people see the world!"" Monday was that turnaround day for me.

Since then, it hit me more or less out of nowhere. Therapy helps, guys, and I heartily recommend it. I've heard that drugs help, but they weren't for me, and I now have proof that that's okay. But the most important thing is, if you can't see a light at the end of the tunnel, because a week ago

Feel free to ask me anything, I'd like to thank a very special redditor, mbingo, who provided me with help in the form of pizza and being an incredibly fucking kind human being on two separate occasions while things were bad. To those of you who are here to help out others, not get help, you really are that awesome. It is impossible to overstate how much a random act of pure kindness and generosity can help someone in a bad spot get through the day. I love you all.

Thanks for reading.

I can't ever relate to any of that stuff, and it makes me feel like an outcast - not only from my peers, but from Western society as a whole!

1373841626.0,1iauzg,Why I Have No Real Friends and Never Will,calling_yo_phone_lol,39,3,8,"Something I’ve always struggled with is depression

My longest relationships currently have been with people I have never even met in real life but speak to on the internet. I’ve known them for about four years now and I’ll be flying out to meet them for the first time in a few days. My time speaking to them has been filled with some doubt whether to keep in contact but they seem genuinely excited to be finally meeting me. I can’t help but be skeptical that I’m not the person they think I am. I’ve easily known people for longer who have eventually gotten sick of me.

After finishing university just over two weeks ago I’ve started to notice the typical human behavior I’ve experienced for my entire life. Ending secondary school I didn’t really get on properly with a lot of my friends and by the end of it I was the typically victimized person of my closest friend circle. Being gay never really helped in an overly masculine group and I would be constantly picked on for it

People don’t contact me. I don’t get messages asking how I am or what I’m doing or what I’ve been up to anymore. When I contact them they seem happy to oblige and share engaging discussions and stories but never the other way round. People just don’t give a shit enough. It isn’t the fact that no one contacts me, until they realize. 

So what are my flaws? What eventually leads these people on to think I’m a decent valuable friend and then eventually decide to abandon me:

- When I get comfortable and honest with my friends I become very negative and realistic because I am. I won’t sugar coat things or just be nice for the sake of it because that’s not really the person I am. When I’m done impressing them and trying to get them to like me I slack off and then they start to realize what a mistake they have made.

- I have this horrible mix or arrogance

- I catch people out when they are wrong and will confront people. Sometimes I can be funny


- I’m not a consistent person. An  ex-friend once said I can be the either the loudest person in a room enjoying being the center of attention or the quietist not really wanting to talk to anyone. I have depressive selfish tendencies which means I can get worked up easily over little things and find myself fighting with myself to control them. If someone irritates me

Being back home now after university no one messages me to go out. I live too far away for anyone to bother with and the one friend that does live near me I don’t enjoy going out with. His friends are pretentious and to a point so is he. People don’t see it but when I’ve been in need he’s been happy to fuck me off. I’ve also been the person asking him if he wants to hang-out at times and was pretty persistently ditched. I’m more than willing to return the favor now

All the friends I made at university have other groups of friends they can hangout and talk to. Not me

In September I move to another city for a new job and to meet new people. Some of my university friends have promised to meet up with me and hang out with me a lot but I doubt they will be able to follow through with that, another facade of getting people to like because I’m that pathetic I can’t help it and then eventually getting bored or them getting to know me too well to the point where they dislike me.

Trying to break this cycle feels like the curse of my life and I’m not sure if it will ever truly end. Being a self pitying dick is the worst kind of person and for that reason keeping hold of friends seems like a pointless task that I am doomed to fail. I don’t really know if I will ever be really happy. Drugs and constant substance abuse kept me sane through uni but with a clear head I only realize how fucked I truly am. The good times still outweigh the bad and I will go on in my life making enemies. It’s interesting to see my Facebook profile constantly slowly depleting and is a constant reminder of what I am.

People never know this about me until knowing me for a long time. I don’t give up this information right away because people would just go running. I can’t tell the people that say they are my friends now because I have no idea what they would think of me and it would just confirm their thoughts. 

I am a shit person and life for me isn’t easy but I can just about make it bearable for periods of time. Hopefully that won’t end but I fear eventually it will. No one can make this right

I decide to hang out with J and get drunk. M comes to hang out too. I have one mixed drink (2 shots) a shot and a few sips of another drink. It was late and I lie down on the couch feeling a bit woozy. J starts touching me, stop, M is in the next room and he's says M isn't there. During this I pass out.

I wake up, and I don't remember taking my pants off or putting it that way. During my shift I go to the washroom and my ass burns and I notice some blood on the toilet paper. I think  maybe it's spotting as I'm on the depo shot. Then I have to go again a few hours later and there's an intense burn and blood in the toilet. I'm worried I'm sick at this point.

When I realized that I'd been raped was when I had sex this morning with the guy I'm seeing. It kind of hurt when he went in and when we were done there was blood all over his dick and it wasn't period blood.

I have no memory of what happened later

I'm pretty traumatized. I cried at work in the morning and told my manager and he said to go home and get some rest. I had to tell my other manager because I was supposed to work at 5.

A beautiful girl, the one I see in my dreams and the the first person I think about when I wake up. She's extremely smart and unlike anyone else at my school. The only girl I could think about for the past year and a half.

I took 2 art classes this year, I had to muster up all my courage just to say hi. We eventually started talking more and more. 

We were talking everyday and I would always walk with her down to her next class as we talked. I was always late to my class 3rd period

2 marking periods had rolled by and she was no longer in my art class. We talked more on Facebook, she'd stop by and say hi around 4:00. I'd stop what I was doing and we'd just talk and walk around the school until she left at 4:30 on the late bus. 

It was really really obvious that I liked her. My friend told me she liked me too and I should ask her out. So I finally did. It took me until February but I called her, I bought her roses and we talked some more. 

I could not have been happier. Here I was planning to go out with the girl of my dreams. Needless to say

Then came Saturday night.

She called me around 11:30 pm telling me she had to cancel. She said she was busy with the Cooper Union home test. I told her it was okay. I knew she really wanted to go to Cooper Union and she had a lot of work to do. It was okay. She sounded really sad so I decided I would try to cheer her up by dropping off flowers when I was supposed to pick her up. Little did I know Flower Shops aren't open on Sundays and I spent 2 hours driving to 3 different shops. I decided I would just head home at that point. We would reschedule after the weekend. I'd let her focus on her work and I'd call her back on Tuesday.

So I eventually did call her. I asked her if we could reschedule and everything went to shit. She responded with ""Sorry... I can't go out with you... because of [John]."" [John] was an old friend of mine and a college freshman. I was crushed. I told her I had a couple questions and continued by asking when they started going out. ""Valentines Day."" I had no idea how to respond at this point. It felt like my chest was imploding on itself and everything was being crammed inside. The only thing I could ask was if she ever liked me. ""Yes... but I've liked [John] for a long time and I like him more than you."" I haven't been able to stop thinking about those words for the past week.

I haven't seen her smile in about a week

The past week I've forced my self to eat. Food just sits in my mouth and doesn't taste like anything. The process of sleeping has been painful. I still can't stop thinking about her.

Slowly I burned through friends as I searched for jobs, on the floor of the extra room in September. Around this time my ex felt bad and got back in contact with me, and me feeling so low, let him back in. Shortly after I started staying with him sometimes but was careful as he made it clear that he didn't want me just moving in right away. After two weeks I got a job offer 3 hours away. I asked him what he though and he said I'd better take it, sounded like a great opportunity. So I took it and he ended up being mad at me for it, saying I had been using him and that he was gonna let me move in but I left instead, etc. After a week he apologized and we started dating long distance. Then I got sick and had to be put on antibiotics. I forgot about the contraindications with birth control and got pregnant. Started freaking out. BF said don't worry about it. Said to quit my job and come home and he will take care of us until I find work. 

I fought it for a while but he kept pushing me to quit and tempting me with how great it would be and eventually I gave up, doesn't know why he thought I did, this was all a mistake, I'll never find a job because I'm useless and we are completely wrong for each other. He says If I don't get an abortion he will fight me for custody because he thinks I am so worthless. This is the sum of what he said abbreviated, the things he actually said were far more detailed and cruel. He said these things after small arguments concerning how often I clean the house and where we should move to.

After realizing who he really is I agree an abortion would be best, no friends to help me, no family who cares (the brother is mad I ever went back and says I deserve what I get). Now I have to figure out how to afford one, find a friend to take me and find another place to live, all while trying to find another job. I know I'm stupid and made mistakes here. It's just so hard to rise above when you are completely on your own. The hardest part is that this baby was wanted at first. An accident yes, but still welcomed and now I have to find a way to not want it, otherwise I will be condemning it and me to a worse situation than I am in now.

A year passed.. then another... then 3 more. 


Don't get me wrong - I'm putting myself out there.  I've dated girls... at least one every 2 or 3 months.  The connection just never happened for me.

So I continue to age.  I continue to watch as one-by-one everyone around me has the love of their life fall conveniently into their lap

Then, and we went on a date last week.  I thought it was fun - we had drinks, good conversation.. it even got to a point where I thought maybe the convo was dieing and it was time to call it a night.  So I asked her if we should do another round.. she shrugged and said ""Sure!"".  I really felt she was interested in me.

Then today, I don't think we should hang out again""

I'm CRUSHED.  It hurts so much to think you see a light at the end of a tunnel.. and then the light fades

TL;DR: Almost 29 and still single.  I've been dating for years.  I'm tired of watching every glimmer of a relationship shrivel up into nothing.  Tired of watching all of my friends' relationships flourish while I continue going nowhere.  I fucking give up.

The short of it is I'm scared of the end of the course. 

As I will have to be ""in the real world"", its freaking me out that I will *have* to function, if I dont function and hold down a job after the end of this course, I will just be a finacial drain on my SO - who only earns minimum wage, and has no true responcibility to me, we aren't engaged or anything, he is just commited to me and loves me, it wouldnt be surprising that I would be left on my own.

And that may be a slightly negative outlook

So aside form that, I have to be able to apply myself, I have to be able to deal with the public, these are just given facts. they are need toos, must do's. there is no ifs ands or buts.

I am not elligable for state support after this course due to being supported through college by the state, when it doesnt even do that, and believe me when I say we have everything cut back and restricted in terms of out goings.

I am seeing a psychologist, depression, abuse, PTSD, Trich, self confidence, etc. the list is as long as my arm. I am not receptive to medication, please understand that.

Aside from all this stress, no one to help me, and being a drain on the only person who does support me even a bit, the friends around me, are very very few and far between. 

And when I am like this, so closed, so un-me that people get offended by it. And I am well aware everyone has their own problems, and I dont want to be the broken record, or take over their time with my whinging, it may be justified for me so I feel better, but that doesn't justify it in my eyes

I talk to my SO

So I am alone. Fragile. Stressed. on the verge of break down. And I just need it all to go away. I need people to care. So I am turning to you guys.

Just, even just validation at this point. I'm so warn out with hurting so much, and letting bits out and people around me shrug like its what theyve all heard before. 

It damn hurts to have living blood realitives who love  a bottle of cider more than they have ever loved you, age 8, having to sneak home to look after your new born sibling because your mother is passed out, cook, clean, bottle wash, and go back to school. That was my life. and I am tired and burnt out.

Some background:
Recently I've been under a tremendous amount of pressure... I moved to Poland (from UK) in search for work
I recently found work

Moving is a stressful time for anyone, as I am starting a new job on Monday... I haven't worked in 2 years. So this is a big shock to the system.

I've been getting wound up over little things not going my way (stupid things, TV not tuning etc) - and raise my voice in anger at the item in question.
Sometimes I may bash something that I know won't get broken - but even so I wont bash it hard... just enough to vent my frustration.

I get this frustration from my fathers side of the family (not that I am trying to make excuses)

So what happened?
We were in the car on the way back from the foreign office.
We are talking about getting stuff for the new flat... things we need.
Now we don't have much money to last us the first month before my payday
I suggest different things we can use... or I ask ""what if...""' kind of questions. - I want to save as much money as possible for the month ahead.
She starts getting all irate at me
One raised voice

I stop, and we need to save rather than spend.
I said we don't have to get these items straight away
But she was failing to understand the point I was trying to make.

This was winding me up

It left a bad taste on the mouth for me to say it
I'm not saying these things on purpose to wind you up
I said to her, but explain why you need it.
If I think it's fine

This wound her up even more
I said in my defense that I have never broken a single thing... I've been under a lot of stress
I said, which she apparently didn't catch on to and said...)
""What you gonna do? Hit me??""

I sat in silence

I said that I have never ever hurt her
I said

She sat there... no remorse on her face

Then I hear a ""You did raise your fist at me

I knew exactly what she was talking about, and my hands were open"" (Kind of like in the movies where they scream at the skies)

She was still adamant about it.


All in all

When we got back, burst out crying. (I am 25 years old, I haven't cried in over 10 years).
She still walks in

Now the thing is... if she was genuinely concerned about my frustration issues lately
But she is so stubborn

We have been married for some time now... 99% of the time we are fine... the 1% we may argue, not a lot.
I love my wife so much

I'm not in denial about some anger issues I have right now... but once I get comfortable in our new place and my new job
It's just that I would never... it sickens me even to think about it... and even upsetting me now just writing about it.

I would rather she confront me about my anger issues

I just wish that she never said such a thing... it really feels like my heart has been crushed and stamped upon.
The question is now

As I have said
I saw it once a number of years ago

I am not that kind of person... she knows that


Sorry for the long post... it needs to go somewhere. 

Thanks for reading.

*EDIT*
Just want to say thank you to the constructive responses I have received.
I will be changing my ways once my new job starts on Monday - getting more exercise (for physical relief), and generally try to keep calm in frustrating situations.

First off

Graduated with a B.S. in May with tens of thousands to repay. 

Beginning of June

Lost all of my Uni friends. Undesireable No. 1. Outcast. Nobody wants to hang out with the maybe rapist. Alone for the summer. Couldn't move home

Letter from the school banning me from the property. Can't go to any reunions

In November

The lawyer cost $50k. Worth it

Got back together with my girlfriend (we were on a break at the time of the alleged rape). She then went abroad for the semester. Watched over Facebook as my girlfriend fucked every guy on her Fall study abroad program. Many times. And a lot of the locals

We almost got back together

Had to drive cross-country twice to move back home from Uni. Bought a lot of gas. Deep in credit card debt and still no job. 

In January

February. After dropping my dad off at the airport, bad timing. Did not get the minimum fine. 

About to sell a family heirloom to pay off debt. 

I only hope that there is some sort of statistical balance in the universe. Either I deserve this string of unfortunate events and it will stop soon

**tl;dr** College debts, month in jail, lost job, abandoned by friends, banned from alma mater, credit card debt, girlfriend fucked a whole country, car and computer broke

Last year, I worked so hard, and even though I was taught the material up to a B, I taught myself the rest and gained an A. I then taught myself more complex algebra and calculus so that I could take an exam which would enable me to take an A Level in Accelerated Maths, which would mean that I took my whole maths A Level in one year instead of two, then take Further Maths A Level in my second year of college.

Anyway

Last week we had our first modular exam. I had done lots of past papers, the exam was much harder and a little different from what we're used to, as in the question style was a little different. Everybody- and even the really good people in the class- thought that it was hard, and the best girl in the class cried because she thought it had gone so badly. I was upset too, because maths is important to me. I want to be a physicist.

Anyway

She told me that ""If"" I carry on with the subject next year (meaning if I pass the Maths A Level) I will do even harder stuff than that. She implied that I do not belong in a grammar school (a school you have to obtain especially high results to be able to attend) and that I am not suited to maths.

Her parents accidentally found out about us early in the summer and banned her from any communication with me whatsoever. Our solution was that I would sneak out of my house at midnight and climb into her window using a ladder...which is my favorite memory of all time. It worked for a while, my girlfriend's parents sent her to a mental institution for one week and then sent her off to stay with family in another state for the rest of the summer. I didn't see her at all, but she did have in her phone while in another state. At the end of the summer her mother came to my house, scolded me, and made me promise not to be romantic with her (I lied). But despite all of this my girlfriend forgave me, easily. And our separation only drew us closer until school started again (I'm a senior). Upon reuniting, my girlfriend gave me a journal she had kept over the summer inside which she had written me a letter every single day. She's perfect. After that horrifyingly lonely, I thought now I could be happy seeing her every day
However, and I cannot forgive anyone who makes her feel this way. Worse, she has to go home to her parents who have been so cruel to both of us. So I thought, I have to be her knight in shining armor. But I am weak and small and fragile. I cannot even take care of myself. The second time we were called out, it was clear how unjust this really is. Our offense this time is hugging. Come on, everyone hugs. I hug my teachers. I can hug my male friends, fine. But when I hug her it's apparently a PDA. I feel discriminated against and my girlfriend is extremely depressed. How can I console her if I cannot hug her? 
I talked to the school administrators today. I wanted to be a hero. I cried my eyes out the whole time
To top it all off, and to console her, I grabbed her hand under a table where no one could see. But she resisted and yelled, saying I don't get in as trouble as she does at all when I do these things. I just fail, and fail, and fail. I've found my princess but get no happy ending. I hate myself for failing so much. I cannot even hug the girl I love the most to ease my pain. I cannot ease hers. I only makes things worse each time. I want to punish myself.

This is my most valued friend. He's helped me through breakups, stupid little things that bothered me...you name it.
He has always been there for me when I needed him
A few months ago he disappeared for a night, and shaking a 20lbs bag of cat food I heard a faint raspy meow from a nearby tree. Something (most likely a coyote) chased him up there and he had gotten stuck. I quickly climbed up the tree and carried him back home.
I collapsed onto the bed and was starting to fall asleep when I heard him coughing in the bathroom. When I went to go check on him I saw that he had thrown up a few times and he was wheezing really badly. I cleaned up the mess and combed his fur to try and relax him. Every other minute he would have a coughing fit. I was trying to not freak out. While combing I came across some dried blood and found the source, ran to my dad in the other room and frantically asked for his help. He refused saying ""He'll get it out himself, cats do that"" I wanted to punch him. I ran back to the bathroom and got out a pair of scissors, gauze, and some bandage tape along with a tweezers. I'll spare the details and just tell you I got it out without a problem. Lewis then crawled into his litter box and fell asleep. Which was really weird considering he is kind of snooty and only sleeps on furniture. I sat in the bathroom waiting for something else to happen, and guess what, something else happened. He woke up after a while and threw up this clear gooey liquid. Almost like drool. In half an hour he had thrown up about 7 times. I was in full blown panic because his wheezing was getting worse by the minute, the skin under his fur was red from a fever and it was 5am. I begged my dad to let me take him to the vet and he said "" No
So
When we got there the vet did an examination and notified me that there is a lump on the back of his neck. Assuming it was from the thorn
Lewis has cancer and it's reached his lungs. There isn't much that can be done other than to make him comfortable.
I'm not sure how much longer he has left. I'm telling you this because...well I needed to tell people that would actually care. He is my best friend.

They have my friend on the phone (the one I would have had pick him up) I talk to her and she tells me she can pick me up, but the teacher at the school offered me a ride, AS I WOULD NEVER EVER! Have driven in that state with my son in the car. So she drives me home, or tried to. We drive past where I had tapped the Van, and he says, oh there she goes. They pull me over and so starts the fun. 
Fast forward to today. All the lawyers say is don’t worry ARD, pay massive fines I'm sure, and I have a feeling I will get a new bill for my lawyer.  
Why do I ask to make me feel better? I feel horrible, Run away and hide. The system treats you like you killed someone. I made a mistake! I’m SORRY PLEASE I AM SOOO SORRY.. I don’t even drink like that, it was a 1 time STUPID STUPID MISTAKE! Why can’t anyone forgive me, help me. All the trouble for a DUI is predetermined. You are a piece of shit and they don’t give a crap about why or anything. They just want to make sure you give them ALL of your money. They denied my ARD because my son was in the car, even though I wasn’t driving and never had intention of driving. Now they want to put me in Jail (72hr) and pay fines, probation and put this on my record for the rest of my life, and forget about car insurance.
 Well they are taking me from my son for that time, I know it is not true.. Someone help me…… I know this is a ramble… but thank you for listening.

I end up spending at least 90% of my time sitting at a desk going over documents and emails, or setting up meetings. I find no joy in it; I have never felt any semblance of excitement or anticipation to come into work. I end up being angry on my drives to and from the office because of the traffic/other drivers.

I ended up spending my birthday alone. No one had actually called me or spoke to me in real-time that day. The best I got was a bunch of Facebook posts mostly because there's a handy little reminder for people so they can look like they care. I haven't spoken with my family in over half a year. I've been sad/depressed, and I'll end up being alone for Christmas and New Year's as well. I haven't made any friends in the area. I never had a visitor outside of family (and that was only once).

Why
Because my piece of shit brother came to my apartment at nearly midnight and woke me up just wanting a shower and to borrow $5 which I loaned him bringing my total to the $56 I mentioned before. I don't know when but at some point he took my fucking money right from my wallet!! He's a drug addict and a thief!

They did, even. I looked almost like a woman who would 'deserve' a boyfriend. I never felt like that before.

Don't get me wrong

I've gone from morbidly obese girl to slightly fat/chubby smart/neat looking woman. I take a lot of care of myself now, and.. I really feel I look presentable. Maybe even attractive, to the right guy.

But I can't be happy. I try to be

I have no one to share it with. I did have a boyfriend, turned out that he only wanted me to be his girlfriend to have sex/affection on tap whilst he flirted and tried to 'pull'/date other women. Hotter women. Curvy, voluptuous ladies that I could not even begin to 'compete' with. Granted, none of those women were interested in him.. but that's not the point.

I wish he could see me now, and that hint of a double chin, flat boobs from weightloss.. But I looked nice.

I live in a small town, I have hobbies and interests.. but absolutely no way to find more friends or date. I don't want to do internet dating, not now, not after the last experience. I trusted him, and he crushed me. I don't even want to see another dating website right now.

No man whose face will light up when he sees me looking extra nice for him in the clothes that now fit, smile at me. No one who thinks plain ol' me is beautiful. No one for me to love wholly back. And no real way for this to happen in the future, either.

We have occasional sexytime only on the horny night of her cycle, not connected enough, not &lt;some behavior&gt; enough...

But it's become impossible to come to it rev'd up with this rejection rate, the rejection crash afterwards is painful enough (emotionally, and uncomfortable physically) without being rev'd up...

It's not like I'm repulsive or anything either... I'm in great shape... She's constantly commenting on how much she loves my smell...  It's also not like she's a prude or anything... maybe it's because her self-judgement?  She's 70+ lbs over what would be commonly thought of as a healthy weight

I'm totally committed to her, it's certainly not a part of our reality... we're together for life and we both know that...  but just this morning I came to honestly admit to myself that the pain in the rejection is just too much to bear, and I've given up on any hope of happy good sexytime anymore :-(

I had recently broken up with my girlfriend at the time, text me during the weekends to find out how I was, so I became worried and tried my best to be there for her. This only made us closer

After this we began seeing each other. At first it was very secretive, even her friends and family, even her boyfriend. Once she looked at me in the eyes and tolde I was the love of her life. I felt exactly the same. I knew from the beginning I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. 

Well time went by, we finally talked about it and she tolde that she was in love with both of us and could make a decision. She was torn and knew that choosing one would mean losing the other and she knew that either way her heart would break. This is when things started going wrong, I told her I wanted to be exclusive and be her boyfriend but if she couldn't leave the other guy I would understand. She would always beg me not to leave her because she thought I would stop being her friend too. She told me she needed me in her life. She confessed to me that she and her boyfriend were no longer intimate. They wouldn't have sex for months and fight about it. She thought there was something wrong with her and had gone to therapy for it. But we had sex all the time and it was amazing. She told me with me she had love, passion, intimacy, and support and understanding. We kep seeing each other, but started fighting more often. Then one friend asked me if she was with me or not because her Facebook said she was in a relationship with some other guy. I checked and coulnt see anything

I stopped trusting her from this point on but I still loved her and believed she would be mine one day. She did eventually break up with him on New Year's Eve, he always knew about me and told her he understood. Well, I wasn't happy and she wasn't happy. But out relationship was still good. We spoke every night on the phone and chatted over Facebook at work. We did see each other once a week or every two weeks. Sometimes we would go Oma snowboarding trip or have a sleep over (at my house of course)

Things didn't change and my feelings of unhappiness towards not being in the relationship I wanted to be got bigger and bigger. We were fighting on regular bases. Many I was ready to give up

We kept on having an on and off relationship and had many fights. Her now ex was still a big part of her life, and she couldn't control what people said on Facebook. 

I had hurt her so much that it was becoming hard for her to be intimate with me and the idea of a relationship was hard to imagine. We tried being romantically involved and it didn't work

One night I finally had it. We had grown apart so much and it would weeks without seeing her. Our phone conversations didn't happened as much anymore, what we were doing wasn't healthy and we should stopped talking to each other and seeing eah other for a while, and that maybe one day we could be friends. She said ok. 

That was a year and half ago. I constantly break down every few months and go stalk her twitter/Instagram. She blocked my number and Facebook. I'm sure she blocked my emails too. I can't stop thinking about her. I miss her. I feel like we were right for each other but we didn't handle properly the circumstances under which we met. Anyways

I tried reaching out to her. I even saw her once for a few seconds this week. I wanted to beg her no to get married. I've had the worst week of my life. It's pretty obvious she's over me and wants nothing to do with me. I did speak to her per chat once briefly last year and when I asked her why we find work out all she said was ""I'm sorry but it wasn't meant to be""

Since I stopped talking to her, I've been in a couple of short films both behind and in front of the camera. I went on a trip to my home country in South America. I've tried dating, I have an online dating profile. I still can keep her our of my mind. I miss talking to her, I miss having her to cheer me up, support me and hear me about whatever was going on in my life. I imagine myself having conversations with her constantly. I start a new job, and on the first day I picture myself telling her how my day was, what my job is like. But I neer actually talk to her. 

I did think she was the love of my life. Instill think she is

I know this was the wrong person to get involved with. Everything points to it. But she hve something no one else has. I felt connected to her and close. At one point we were crazy for each other but our problems pulled us apart. 

She is getting married today. I lost. I lost her. She starts the rest of her life with some one else today, I just want to feel sad.

Basically what happened:

I am currently employed in a state across the country from where my parents live, networking, and trying to build career opportunities for myself.  (If you're in the Bay Area, hit me up!)

Coming from a different generation

Anyway

So I responded by reaching out to them emotionally, but it's in the hundreds).  I asked them to please lay off the pressure for a while and not tell me how disappointed they are in me.

My dad's response was to ignore all that

Well

Next

The second is a private e-mail to me telling me to change all of my permanent addresses on my major accounts to my current one (I was still using their house while I was moving around for consistency on my bank accounts), he told me to cut off my last ties to them.

My dad signed it saying that they wish me good luck in my job search.

After that

I haven't heard from them since, trying to find a way to read my text messages.  Also, they've apparently read insurance statements accidentally sent to their house and the fact that I've had appointments at Planned Parenthood might be factoring into this.  Oldest sister thinks I should cut my losses and run, possibly look into restoring links with them in the future but at a cool distance.

My second oldest sister is upset that the family is being a bit torn apart and wants me to make up with them and apologize to my dad for calling him ignorant.  :/

And yeah

I don't understand this or my parents' behavior.  I don't know why they think I deserve this.  My theory is that my dad panicked thinking that I was about to ask for money or to move in with them

So far I've been saying fuck 'em and I'm pretty ok with it.  It's been a long time coming for various reasons.  The timing is horribly unfortunate, and feels pretty dangerous considering how depressed I've been getting over various aspects of my life not working out and then this.

It'd be really nice to have an example of the light at the end of the tunnel.  Because all of this struggling and then feeling ridiculously emotionally abandoned sucks pretty hard.

Not to say that it's that bad.  I know a lot of people out there have had it worse, I have parents.  They just don't want to support me or be in my life anymore for whatever reason.  It feels so weird.

I think the ""fix"" for me is to build a ""family"" elsewhere.  I've had trouble with that in my past

my dad doesn't talk to me aside from telling me how better he always is than me when he was my age and degrading everything that I do. he keeps mentioning that I'm a disappointment because I decided to study in engineering while he wanted me to become a doctor (the classic Asian family story).

The thing that I don't get is that everybody loves my older brother, and always needs to borrow money from my parents because he's always in debt. up until now my dad GAVE (not borrowed... GAVE) 75 000$ to my brother for absolutely no reason at all, while he refused to LOAN me some money to help me  pay the down payment for my house, even though I promised to pay him back. he also bought my brother two cars (one Acura that he totalled).

Once I even stopped helping my parents around, could step in and do something at least. what happened was that I received a barrage of calls from my sisters and brother saying that I was ungrateful and that I should do more for my parents.

These are pictures of my cat Shadow, and two that I took this morning. He's always been a character, because his meow is weird and rattly and because he likes to sleep in the sink and happily licks the faucet when there is water pouring down on him. And he's always trying to hump Snowflake, our girl cat, because he seems not to know he's been neutered his entire life. He's such a sweetheart, even if his front paws weren't declawed he wouldn't ever try to claw up anyone. He doesn't even bite, he just goes limp when you pick him up.

About a year ago at his vet checkup he had lost weight, but in the past month or so, he's started looking more skeletal. When we started watching him we realized that he literally never eats. After the vet told us he found nothing else wrong, and he might just have lost his sense of smell, my mother bought a flat of really expensive special diet food for him, and he nibbles a bit on it as we try to fend off the other cats (Socrates is a fatty). But then he loses interest. He'll eat a bit off our finger, or off a spoon, and sits

We tried oil-packed tuna... We've tried fish oil on their food, I just... *know* that he is dying, a little bit every day. And I wish so much I could make this easier for him, because starvation is one of the most awful deaths I can think of, it's so slow and miserable, and I can't do *anything* about it.

TL;DR: Shadow is slowly starving to death. Should we keep trying to feed him

I love my cats to death. They were furry little balls of comfort whenever my family was being stupid

EDIT: Shadow had lost an entire pound since the last check-in a month ago. He only weighed like 6-7 lbs in the first place. When the vet attempted to draw blood, making it pretty likely to be hyperthyroidism, which is actually good news, since that's one of the things we can actually treat. As mom talked to the vet I found out he also has cardiomyopathy, which is permanent damaged function, though I think he was just born with that. Hopefully if the thyroid treatment works his heartbeat will slow down too. We currently have him sleeping on a heating pad and blanket (his temperature was below normal) and have fed him anorexia diet wet food a few times through a little oral syringe. We will have the results tomorrow morning. Thank you all for your suggestions and support and I will update tomorrow as well. :)

EDIT 2: The results came in and mom texted me them at school. Shadow is in liver and kidney failure and there's really nothing that can be done to save him at this point, if not, Thursday evening. He's been laying in a corner of the living room he's been in for days, been using his carrier in that room to urinate since he can't make it to the litterbox. Sometimes he wanders listlessly, calls out loudly in distress, but mostly he just lays on his side with his eyes open, quiet.

by Brianna Wiest	 

Nothing is eternally damaged. Not even you. I think we have a tendency to exacerbate things in our minds by the way of not being able to let them go. Logically

After a particularly difficult phase of my adolescent life, you’re not going there. She told me that everybody has these issues (referencing the specific ones I had at the time). Everybody deals with these things. She did, her friends did, my ancestors did in one variation or another. This was nothing new and this is nothing that I have been solely victimized to.

And I think her words hold true for a lot of things. Yours was certainly not the first heart to be broken — in fact

So we just can’t sit around and let ourselves crumble when these things do happen — even when we’re feeling like all of our worst fears came true and there’s no reason for going on. Even when you feel lifeless and like there’s nothing that can propel you out of it– well, that even if you are temporarily hurt, you will not be broken forever.",,False,,t5_2sjdn,,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1ikhst/i_just_read_this_on_thought_catalog_it_made_me/

As the weeks turned into months, rarely playing games anymore, and constantly mentioning the idea of suicide. He'd tried it many times before I met him, apparently, and every time he mentioned it I did my best to talk him out of it. Time passed, and the New Year came. He grew ever more distant from me and all his friends, saying only a few words before logging out. I thought he was just busy

Suddenly, and changed his profile to say only one word: ""I'm sorry"".

That was 3 days ago. He hasn't been online since. We've all been posting words of encouragement on his profile, and he changed his voice mail to say the same thing: ""I'm sorry"".

The last time we found each other, I told him I still remembered his phone # from when we first met, he was amused. I still remember it today, 19 years later. We talked almost every night. He said sweet things when my dog, one of the great loves of my life, died. He wanted me to come see him so he could hold me. He didn't want me to be sad. 

He asked me to come see him for my birthday,really** wanted to!  I checked the train schedule. I fantasized about it. I hadn't seen him in a couple years, so it seemed about right. 

We began arguing over the phone all the time. He would get drunk and project all this anger onto me. I would say ""Hey baby"" and he would respond ""Why are you always so angry!?! You're still mad about that thing I did ten years ago, everything was a lie! I would hear other chicks in the background and he would tell me what he was going to do to them. We had an argument. We both screamed and yelled. 

We had yet **another** fight. He didn't call me back. I decided to reinvent myself. I ended up getting a rescue Boxer just a few weeks later, but I had been through that so many times with him that I thought I would just roll with the punches and be fine. We would meet each other again in the future, and repeat.

1365173456.0,1bqhla,I just woke up from a dream about someone I loved and will never see again...,Glarks,26,2,8,"This is tough to type out. Stream of consciousness ahead.

I'm one of those people who forms really, but being an adult means managing your problems and I do so. Most of the time it's fine.

Today doesn't seem to be one of those ""most of the time"" days. I woke up about an hour ago from a dream about a particularly strong attachment who is now gone. The details don't really matter. They're gone

Once in a while you meet someone who manages to punch through any sort of logic or rational thought and just draws you to them -- inexplicably and completely. If you're lucky

And you do what nature makes you do in that situation -- you try anyway, but the pull was so strong that deep down you know you'll never regret it.

And then you wake up ages later and you have that dream where the two of you are standing in Grandma's kitchen and you're cooking a simple meal because that's what was on hand, and you completely mean it and you know you mean it, and you can tell by their polite smile that they don't trust that you mean it and don't want to get caught up in you again, but you choose to interpret that as a maybe anyway because the moment is so perfect, just to behold and observe and hear that voice again -- intuition and futility be damned, you're going to enjoy this meal and this time together while it's here.

And then you wake up, the memory of the voice clearer than ever, and you choke back a tear while you look at an old picture and you know that they aren't an email or a phone call or a facebook message or a letter or even a road trip away anymore. They're gone. So much left unsaid. You say to yourself ""all I ever wanted was to resolve this and make it feel complete"", but of course that's a lie. You want to embrace, to press your face against theirs, and to stay there until your last heartbeat passes and that's the last moment you'll ever experience.

You know what to do. You know you have to put it aside. You have a whole day to live. The sun is bright, and you have only limited time with them, too. You should go to them. You should have lunch with the people who make you laugh. You should make that simple meal in your dream, but make it huge, and call everyone you care about and bring them to your table and celebrate life and friendship. You should take a drive or a hike or a ride or a walk and remind yourself of the whole world out there for you to discover. You should let the things around you now be the most important things in your world, the way you've chosen that they would be.

But...they aren't the most important, and you feel guilty for cheating it. The part of you who knows better resents you, too. It knows you should have more control. You're better than this. You've shed enough tears. You're a grown man, be in control of yourself.

And then in the back of your mind is the voice of experience. He knows that tomorrow

Because she really deserves more

So I'm not feeling too good. Here's the background info.

I'm a 21 year old guy. My ex is 19, until she decided to join the guard to pay for school. 

She went to basic training, but soon she became more and more distant. She had made some friends with some very wild girls (she is usually more the socially awkward type) and started drinking and partying on the weekends with all of the new guys and girls she had met. Long story short, she became so distant, and I became so irritated by that, that we decided to break up and maybe try to pick up the pieces when she got back. 

She got back a little over a month ago, so I told her ""I still have feelings for you, and you don't have to tell me how you feel about me, but I just want to know if I'm barking up the wrong tree or not"", and she said she didn't know how she felt, but that she still wants to hang out.

When we hang out, we make out and she crashes at my place in my bed. We spoon and stuff, but we have not had sex since she has been back. It has left me very confused, but I figured maybe she just wants to take it really slow. My more recent thoughts however are that there is another guy that she went to tech school with that works at the same base as she does now. It's a horrible feeling, and the mixed signals are so painful to endure from some one I cared so much about, that every time we part I never want to see her again, and I want to move on. It's almost impossible to get over her though when she comes over and makes out with me and sleeps next to me once or twice a week.

So just last night we went to a party together and made out a little and what not, I saw it as an opportunity to get some answers, so I went through her texts. I know I know. Never a good thing to do, but I wanted to know what was going on here.   

I really didn't want to do it. I don't want to be that guy that sneakily goes through her phone

First off, she is saying, stuff like ""I know you have a girlfriend, so I'll let you make all the moves"" and ""I don't want to be the bad guy here"". Then she goes on to say things like (damn this is hard to type) ""I want to have sex again, but that probably depends on how things are with your girlfriend"" and ""That was the best sex of my life"" and ""you have a nice body"". He says stuff like ""Hey you should come early so we can have sex"", and ""I was just thinking about how I want my dick in you again"". One particularly stabbing segment was when, apparently they hadn't had sex in awhile

At one point, he chokes her when they have sex too. I had done that here and there when we used to be together, but I was never very comfortable with it. It is something she likes I guess.

In a conversation with another co-worker

All of these texts were dated 12 days ago, and he has an apartment down there, so It's the first time she will be in his area. She said ""I finally get to come work tomorrow"" and they made plans to go get burgers.

I hate the feeling I have right now. I wish I could just forget her and move on, but I feel like I'm being dragged along by this monster she has turned into. I just want to do the work for her parents, get the money, and then never talk to her again.

Basically, due to my 'secret' condition. I'm in my early 30's, and I don't feel as if I'm a Forever Aloner-type, but I definitely have an insane, almost crippling fear of intimacy. 

I've never gotten past first base, as being a young, single, workaholic/alcoholic chap is pretty much acceptable in your 20's. I'm somewhat charismatic in social settings, so a few eyebrows have been raised when I don't bring a date to events/weddings/etc...

I said ""what the fuck are you talking about?""

As I am listening to her story, random myspace hookups while pregnant,the one I walked in on at her place that drove from three counties over just to fuck,the fact that I was almost a random hookup because the first night I met her she was drunk on her balcony and saw me carry out garbage with a beer in my hand (the rare occasion that i drink) and invited me in with her roommate and a little strip tease action started and this was back when I still had a girlfriend and a conscious so I got up and left,and kicked myself for it ever since,but I digress..

Sp while shes rambling on about her night,when things were already getting bad between us.I was also stewing on all that I had done for her,and practically been a great boyfreind,and reaped none of the benefits,plus everyone telling me (my roommate,my freinds,other neighbors

So I told her it was best if she left.I told her she came over unannounced and drunk,and she just helped herself to it.She said a few choice words,mainly questioned our friendship,and left.

I decided to take it to facebook.I basically wrote this:

""Look michelle,and someone she calls for help when her life is in crisis and talks mad shit about when she dont need him)
 for emotional and financila support and then fuck just any old body.Where are these men that come from all over to fuck you when you need a ride to the store,or to help you move?Why are they so eager to come running when youre horny but they ghost out when youre in a bad way?""

She wrote back with a few more choice words


Fast forward to early june this year.

I was up at my dads house cleaning some shit up in the garage and saw her mothers bible 

from michelle...

""hey man whats up!long time no see!i miss your face!""

I went back to the garage and got the bible.

two days later she texted me again,so invited her over.

She came over,and she proceeded to tell me whats been happening with her.She told me all about going skydiving,and taking up with this awesome guy named jeff,and how she really really liked jeff,and he is the one that took her skydiving,andhow great and lifechanging it is,and they were staying at this skydiving ""farm"" somewhere in GA with a bunch of cool hippy skydivers.

Till one day jeff went to work,decided she would spend the day hanging out being one of the boys.Well,some one decided a few beers would be a good idea,and michelle,being typical michelle,decided she could just have ""one beer""...

michelle never has""just one beer"" and then thats the end of it.Michelle has to have one,then some liquor,then some coke,then let your imagination run wild as to the shenanigans she gets herself into when she decides to have ""one beer""..

needless to say,and it turned into a big scene,then she missed work,called while drunk and lied about her car being fucked up to cover,then showed up three hours into her shift still hammered,in HER CAR,the one she forgot she told her boss was fucked up
so lets recap.shes lost her boyfriend,and bad ass job,all over ""just one beer"".

so she bailed back home and shacked back up with bill.

now shes also telling me about two other ""boy toys"" shes met at this farm,and she""doesnt know what to do with them just yet""...and im also hearing how bill has let his house get foreclosed on,and moved into a small camper on a plot of land out int he woods in the middle of nowhere by a creek,with no running water,and that she'd been sleeping at his camper for a week in a small recliner,showering outdoors with a solar shower,I.E roughing it

so here i sit,and realizing how late its getting,im starting to realize,she has no intentions of leaving tonight.the gears in my head are turning,so i figure,what the hell,its been three years since i myself have been laid,so i asked her did she want to spend the night ..

she practically said yes before i even asked..


so i get her some boxers and a t shirt to sleep in

i ask her if we can make out for a little bit

i start getting all worked up,and once i went down on her she wouldn't care anymore,as ive turned many a ""no's"" into ""FUCK YEAHS"" just by giving some head,as Ive been told im quite skilled...

she stopped me dead in my tracks at her belly button and said ""nope""

i was like""aww wat the hell why not'

""cause man""..

and i said ""cause man?thats the best excuse you can give""..

she laid there in silence..

i asked her ""am i really that repulsive?"" 

to which she replied ""no

i just rolled over and said ""today i learned a 17 year old virgin has more game than me""...

she moaned and said ""ohhh fuck you man its not even about that"" 

""what is it then? do you know me too much?am i too familiar?if i was some schmuck you just met  at the bus stop would you fuck me?""

He said he lied to get out of the house because he wanted to go to his friend Marc's house to hang out and that he did wind up going there but only for a little while. I came back to our apartment and there was an empty six pack in front of him so he was telling the truth about drinking at home, at least.

This Saturday, and it would generally be a good time. I walked in, seeing almost all the employees, and I was waiting for Alex to get there so I could apologize to how I made him feel.

I guess some backstory is in order.

My apartment was robbed back in December one week before Christmas. They stole nearly every technology item I had. My 360. Gone. My laptop. Gone. My high quality studio headphones that I use to write music with. Gone. I took all of that in stride, but when I looked on my bed...

Wolfie was gone... he was nowhere to be seen... The bastards took him...

It was... ok initially. I had other stuffed animals I could hold and cuddle with, I miss him so much. He was my little buddy for a lot of my late highschool and early college years that helped me get through rough nights of studying and heartsickness.

Wolfie was a relatively rare plush only made for a brief time in the 1980s. He was made as a promotional plush for the Big Bad Wolf rollercoaster for Busch Gardens. I stumbled upon him at a yard sale one day, I got more attached to him. He was one of those plushes that was both adorable and ferocious to hold.

[This is the only picture I have of him right now.](http://i.imgur.com/njjVS.jpg) He was sitting on top of my ""finals load"" for the season (my massive pile of caffeine and various candies that I used to fuel my late night study sessions at the end of my Bachelors).

Yet inside, as I just turned 20 in January, I shouldn't feel the same sad way I did through my childhood.

But in all honesty, and is now only about once every five months, I'd say it's a huge improvement. But it's still there, that feeling. And when I do combat the urge, and just deal with it on my own, the shitty feelings I would have let out by cutting remain inside, festering and turning into yet another internal scar.

The worst thing right now
As a little kid she completely destroyed my self worth. She made it clear that I was of little worth to her

She's BiPolar Type 1. That's the one where you're always depressed

When I had my son

She fucks up, which is why she showed up on Christmas day at my Grandma's and attacked me while I was trying to get my boy in the car.

Filing restraining orders on your Mom is a lot more fun than you'd expect. Except not really

I was suppoused to meet with my psychiatrist today

Instead, and then picking up some valentine's cards and decorating for his preschool friends. I may not be working through my problems right now, but I will be happy. On days like this, being happy is the main objective.

Again, everything is working fine and coming together, but I'm trapped behind the good old fucking brick wall of depression.

So here's the deal (using my throwaway account).  I got an MBA this past spring.  Thought I would be totally employable, when rent was due, I had a total of about $75 to my name (my rent is over $600).  

My friends all say how awesome and employable I am, actually.  Went on foodstamps already (thank FSM I can actually buy food now), and I am at the end of my rope.  I can't go on government assistance (welfare) because I pay too much in rent but it would cost me too much to move.  My family has no money (I'm the only one in my fam to even get a college degree, much less a masters) and I've no rich friends to ask to borrow from.  Plus, later this month I will have over $120K in student debt coming due from undergrad and grad (even though I worked all through school, MBAs are one of the priciest degrees to get).

A bunch of stuff happened (financial crises: car accident, just hand jobs.  Gave a really nice massage in the session before the happy ending since that is my trade (I'm a certified massage therapist).  No one at school and most of my friends would never have guessed, and truly I judged it harshly before I had to resort to it.  As they say, walk a mile in someone's shoes.  Anyway.  I had a couple of experiences with douchebag guys that just made me feel DONE.  And I promised myself that if I ever felt that way I would honor it and not go against it - I have worked too hard on my emotional and mental health to sacrifice it (abusive background, insane family, typical survivor, but I have worked really really hard to be a mostly functional human).

I have a couple of money-making things in the works but can't sell much more off to make money.  I even thought of selling my nearly worthless car and my purebred dog or my computer, I have been doing it for over 10 years but have less than the minimum hours needed to work at most spas where I wouldn't have to carry my table.  I even went off the antidepressants that I had been on for several years because I just can't afford them.  Luckily, I am not suicidal but it's been an added hardship.

I *really* don't want to go back to doing sex work.  Going against that feeling of being ""done"" would make me feel like a whore

I just don't know what to do.  Please tell me it will be ok.  I know there are lots of people in my situation (and worse

Despite the whiny tone of this post, I am extremely exhausted and increasingly lonely. 

Dating is an impossibility because between work and school, and then nights I do have class, I don’t get to see him more than 30 minutes. Weekends I reserve to spend time with him, which leaves no time for dating, or any other social activity for that matter. His autism restricts the activities we can do and the places we can go, and those limitations make it difficult to downright unenjoyable to try and plan social activities with him involved. I am also well aware of the fact that the selection of guys who will date a single mom with an autistic son is a very slim pool. 

I am just feeling so depressed and lonely. I know eventually I will be out of school and making more money (hopefully!) which will free up some time and hopefully eliminate the paycheck-to-paycheck struggle we currently deal with. After I put my son to bed tonight and made sure all the rooms in the house were clean, comforting hug and want to cry.

I have been becoming more and more suicidal. As the title states, nor do I have a time set.

I feel worse and worse and I don't know why. Like I said, I have hobbies that I love but don't make me happy or fulfilled, I have 3 or 4 friends who care about me (just one would have been absolutely novel to me less than two years ago), my family cares about me, I take care of myself, I keep my space clean, I'm ""disgustingly"" healthy (doctor's words).

The only thing that I can think of that is making me depressed is my girl problems. I've never kissed a girl in my life. Like I said, and I haven't met any through friends (not big partiers or anything). I never went to high school, so I'm socially inept. At this point, I'm so depressed that I feel like I'm pushing everyone I already know away - I'm in no condition to ""put myself out there,"" as I am told to do (what the fuck does that even mean?)

Yeeahh no.

I got the last rejection letter in the mail yesterday. Roughly three months ago, and dismissed me with a huge smile on her face, giving me her warmest regards.

Yet

High school was disastrous for me. I was morbidly depressed and had no control over myself/no concentration, and even so, it’s still a habit that’s not fully developed.

My grades were awful. At my lowest I didn’t do much besides hope to die every day

I mean, with my consistent failures, I feel like I have nothing to look forward to, I feel deserving of nothing, and I feel like one of the least desirable people in our society. Not only from being rejected the opportunity to pursue a higher education, the only thing I’ve been looking for ward to since the day I stepped into my high school, but because I feel as though I’ve always been rejected by almost everyone else in my everyday life too.

One last poem for my poetry buddy


Ever since I realized that I liked men, we would want for nothing else and be happy in that fact, together. Maybe we will adopt. Maybe we'll move to the city. Maybe we'll fuck life in the norm and join a traveling gypsy band. 
Whatever we did

I was so very wrong to say that I never felt that there was an us, it tells me that it is not special. It hurts me, because it makes me feel like I won't ever truly make you happy, and I fear you'll always need more. If this is truly what you want, for what reason did you text me last night and say ""fuck other men. you are all i need."" That is all I wanted to hear. I let my guard down and was ready to move forward and trust you and trust us. 
Today you told me that the very night you sent that text
 If it means nothing to kiss other men, not even for me?

1332136942.0,r34d0,Girlfriend has been raped and it's destroying me.,throwthisawayplx,25,4,23,"About 7 months ago I had just got out of a bad relationship and while at a show a girl introduced herself to me and really took me by surprise. I've gone through life being a fairly introverted person and the fact that a girl that I was definetly attracted to was making the effort to get my number kind of blew my mind. We talked and hung out a few times and I decided to ask her out. This whole time she seriously thinks i'm the greatest guy ever and she really seems to be crazy for me (which is weird for me). This girl would do anything for me.

 Months pass and she tells me she had been raped prior to meeting me (i'm thinking it happened 4ish months before we met). She was 15 at the time and the guy that raped her was in his early 20's

She said she was literally carried off by this guy kicking and screaming and thrown in a room as the guy proceeded to rape her. No idea to what extent

This is all she told me about the incident itself but i was absolutly devestated. I almost broke up with her out of disgust and sadness that this sweet girl had gone through that but I just couldn't justify doing that to this girl that I care about.

I'm begging you to give me some advice. I've continued to date her and we have regular sex and we're both clean. She's 17 now and im 19 but it literally is constantly looming overhead. The fucker that did it was caught and paid something like 200

I'm seriously asking for help here. I feel like it is a huge setback and I find myself laying in bed at night with this feeling of absolute repulsion and anger about it. Theres nothing I could do to stop it I didnt even know her then but it just for some reason will not go away. It kills me. I try to be supportive and she doesn't seem to think about it much. But I know I do. almost daily. 

TL;DR girlfriend was raped before I met her and the anger is constantly looming over my mind

Ok so winter break starts and I go on a drug binge for a week. I start work afterwards. Now a week in I realize the girl and the boss's relationship is getting kind of rocky and she has started to talk to me about it. Basically we talk when he's not around and I give her advice and shit like that. Now one night when we're talking I notice she has scars on her wrist

Now fast forward a few days. It's New Years I'm at a party, her father is insanely controlling and abusive and forces her to pay bills. Alright so the closer we get, I start to notice she's really depressed, she keeps telling me to leave her and that she's bad for me and that I deserve better and she will end up hurting me. She always talks about wanting to disappear or just leave this country, basically she talks a lot about isolating herself. But the attachment I felt to her was too strong and I couldn't walk away. I started to fall in love with her and she told me she was falling in love with me. Well she ends up having a lot of fights with her bf at this point and we just keep getting closer. We've hung out a few times, I taught her how to drive blablabla. So one night she calls me crying, saying her bf choked her and pushed her around and bruised up her arms. Now at this point the most we've done is hug, but after she told me this all bets were off. I take her to a park that night to calm her down

Now take into consideration that all this is happening while I'm still working there.  So I start getting jealous and angry when she talks to him and hugs him and laughs with him, (lose my appetite, have obsessive thoughts, fear of losing her). A week before college I decide to quit my job. Ok so college starts and we take our first class. The night before we had a pretty weird conversation. She had started to feel guilty about cheating on him and kept saying she really loves him. She tells me I should leave her because I deserve better. She says she feels like the only reason I fell in love with her was because I opened up to her and that it would have been the same with any other girl. So now my anxiety is pretty bad and the feeling of losing her is eating away at me. I tell her not to leave me and she said she won't. Okay so next day I take her out to this viewpoint I know and she was acting really weird and wouldn't kiss me. That really fucked with me, but she ended up kissing me a bit later. 




THIS IS WHERE SHIT STARTS GOING DOWNHILL




Now I drop her off and she goes to work. She sends me a text saying ""omg don't text me until I text you"", she cries, she calls her friend. Well he ends up calling her and telling her to go back to work. Okay so she texts me later that night and she's super depressed about the whole thing and feels very guilty. She tells me that he won't let her touch him or talk to him. Now the next day I take her out again and we're just in the car. I notice she's acting weird and she tells me ""I did something..."" but she wouldn't tell me what. So I push and push until she shows me her wrist and she had cut herself. Now that fucked with me a lot. She was obviously hurting really bad but I thought she was just going through a phase. Now I take her back to work that night and she texts a few hours later telling me she left work because she couldn't take it anymore. She told me that she had told the guy the text was for me, but she had made up a story about how I had told her I liked her and that was the only reason she was texting me. She wouldn't tell me where she is. She tells me she's taken 12 advils...now I start to freak out and don't know what to do, she kept telling me she's fine and that 12 advils won't kill her. She wouldn't tell me where she is. So she goes home and I feel better and I just fall asleep cus at this point I'm mentally exhausted. 

So next day around mid afternoon she calls me and says she left the store again. She comes to my house and she just cries and cries and cries. He calls her up and tells her to come back to work so I take her back. Now it's Tuesday (Valentines Day) and I have a breakdown. I'm absolutely scared that she's going to fucking kill herself and I can't call her or text her because she's at work. I end up calling my therapist and setting up an appointment. Now around 4pm she calls me and tells me the guy is freaking out about the text and has lost his shit. I tell her to just get the fuck out of there but she won't listen. About 5 hours later she texts me saying she told him everything about what we did. And I'm thinking okay so it's over. Nope...She breaks down, really dark shit. So now I'm freaking the fuck out and I try to calm her down telling her he wasn't good for her, but nothing is fucking working. So I tell her I'll fix this and I'll get them back together. I start texting him literally begging him to take her back so she doesn't fucking kill herself. He's drunk as fuck and he's telling me that he can't be with her anymore and that I should take care of her from now on. So here I am, in the middle of this shit, a girl I had fallen in love with is trying to kill herself over another guy, and the other guy doesn't want her. So after begging him for about an hour he starts texting her and calms her down.

 Now next day, won't let her touch him or talk to him. She calls me up tells me to go over there and ""give her soul back"". At this point I am mentally broken. I go over there, none of us talk, I just sit in the kitchen staring at the floor, this last for an hour until suddenly she's crying and screaming at him telling him she's sorry that she fucked up that she loves him. He's telling her he can't be with her anymore that she's like his sister now that he loved her and she was his life. I'm still sitting there and can't say anything. Just had the most empty feeling. And out of nowhere he grabs her and tells me to check her bag for pills. I wasn't sure wtf happened but I check her bag and tell him there's nothing there. Then she distracts us and downs a bottle of pain meds. The guy grabs her by the throat and throws her on the floor and sticks his fingers in her mouth to get her to throw up, this lasts for an hour. So now she's telling him she'll kill herself if he doesn't take her back. So we spend the rest of the night calming her down, and he tells her they'll work things out.

 Now when she's not paying attention he takes me to a corner and we have a talk. He tells me he doesn't want to be with her anymore and that he needs my help to leave her. He tells me he'll let me have her and that he'll just sell the shop and move away. At this point I'm pretty desperate, he tells me to copy paste whatever texts she sent me that night, and he tells me that from this day on I need to send him her texts. Okay so next day she calls me in the morning before work, we talk a little and she tells me she'll call me when she gets home. Alright so fast forward, she texts me, again talking about the same depressive shit. I show the guy those texts. But then she says what I had been dreading ""We need to stop talking"", so she calls me, her telling me how amazing I was to her and that she'll never forget me and that I deserve better and that she'd still like to keep in contact through e-mail. Now I didn't tell the guy anything about the conversation we had that night. I just told him she called and said she doesn't want to talk anymore. Ok so that's that. 

Now next day (Friday) around 2:00 PM or so the guy calls me and tells me he wants me to send her a text. I tell him she doesn't want to talk anymore so what's the point? He tells me it's ok, she says I was the only person she trusted and that I fucked that up. But at the same time she's texting him and she tells me ""I still believe him"" but won't tell me what he's saying. Anyway I tell her I'm sorry that I wasn't thinking straight that this whole situation has fucked with my head and I get super depressed. 

So next day she calls me, nothing. I'll explain later."" So the whole day I'm depressed and just sleep. I expected her to text me when she got home but she didn't, so I text her asking her to tell me what happened. No answer...I get woken up to a text from the guy. He tells me that I fucked up any chance of getting her back by telling her his plan. He tells me to never contact her again and that she's his gf and he's recording all her phone calls and texts. So I'm still thinking she wanted to keep in contact through email...so I email her the next day but I get no response. Now Monday night I send her a message on youtube asking her to talk to me, she responds by saying ""what do you want me to say?"" I'm pretty depressed now and I say some things I shouldn't have said, she tells me she's happy now and that she loves him and that he's her life. She tells me I should have left her like she had told me to do and that a lot of things had changed since Friday. Then she just stops messaging me. This honestly fucked with me really bad. 

I can't believe a girl that I had such deep feelings for is able to so easily delete me from her life. I ended up getting super drunk a week ago driving around and I called her like 6 times leaving voicemail messages. Her bf calls me because I guess she told him I called and I'm crying my eyes out telling him idk wtf I'm doing. He tells me to go see him at the shop and we have a talk. Idk wtf to do anymore, I'm trying to man up but nothing seems to be working. I've come to find out she has something called Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), at least from what I've been reading on the internet.I need all the advice I can get right now because my thoughts have become very negative and it's taking a toll on my life and I'm genuinely scared of the world. I really want to move on from this but I can't fucking get her our of my mind, I think about her all day long and I dream about her every night. I miss her a lot and still want her to be a part of my life, just as friends, but I can see that it won't happen. I really need help here. ",,,,

Let me clear this up. I'll try to do this by typing out my train of thought that lead to this somber epiphany. I am very overweight, and no one who wouldnt love me as I am now is worth the time and effort to lose weight for.
This is where I began to unravel. I noticed that I can't have what I want if I hold the course. I want more than anything to find my one and start a family. Nothing else really means anything hobbies are just leisure to me and a job or even a career are just a means to an end. even my dream job if I could have it is just just a job it wouldn't be fulfilling enough to keep me going.

Through most of high school I was a pretty well-liked guy and had a solid group of 15ish friends I'd spend time with almost every weekend night. I was confident and invested in my friendships and in my hobbies. Sure

Then a year and a half ago I moved to college at a state university. And shit, I go to a huge party school in a college town, so I feel like this entire city is having the time of its life and I'm just so entirely lost.

I think I've gotten to the point where I realize just how complete my loneliness is. I was happy here at first. My entire freshman year I studied unbelievably long hours. This was a habit I could not keep up, and leave; I never make friends or even contribute anything to the tight-knit group that always hangs out there.

All in all

This loneliness is so complete, offing myself, dropping out of college, moving away for a while ... but I never do any of it. And that's a good thing, I suppose, since all those things in the back of my mind are such desperate measures. But at the same time, the lack of something cathartic like that lends such a constant

the police arrived and took me to my shop the lads had gone when they saw them about 8 cops turned up in total i was of course shaken and examined my shop they had put a hole through my newly built counter and dented my wall which had just been plastered this morning but not to much damage.

as i was talking to the police man he said there isnt much he can do because they have more witnesses (which is absolutely atrocious i think) then my sister arrived and said 3 big guys where looking for me (i was petrifide im 5'8 and way 9 stone) but she said theyd come to help apparently one of the guys had seen what was happening and called his mates they had all raced down in car to come help me the police say the guy commented saying ""the little lad wouldnt have had a chance there was about 30 of them and about 10 went into the shop"".

1307389666.0,ht3mn,Social Anxiety problems anyone?,ProverbialPrison,24,1,8,"This is my first reddit post. I've been a long time lurker, this is going to be long winded and most likely poorly formatted. I'm mostly spewing things as they come to mind

I'll start off with some information about myself. I'm 22 years old, have been in and out of a community college for a few years now. I'm encountering a growing amount of self loathing with each passing year.

I've always been sort of a shy guy. I've only dated two girls to this day, most of which I've known for a long time (I'm terrible at making new friends). My shyness seems to have reached some kind of new level in the past few years when I find myself getting anxious and ignoring calls from friends or family (both of which get frustrated). In the past year or so, I joined an upstart band as the keyboardist, but stopped attending practice after a few months due to the extreme uneasiness I would feel trying to fit in with my band-mates (who were all extremely social people). I liked every one of them; but I couldn't shake this anxiety and was losing sleep dreading practice.

I'm perpetually tired during the day. This, dreading the morning.

I'm pretty good at acting casual and outgoing when I'm confronted with a necessary social encounter (such as a boss, and tend to get incredibly awkward when a topic is brought up which I have little or no interest in, or knowledge about (politics and sports being the two prime offenders).

I recently joined a gym in an attempt to help quell this anxiety. I'm not overweight in the least, and I can't help but be scared of being Forever Alone. Then again, it doesn't matter how toned I am if I can't carry on a conversation with girls I'm not extremely familiar with.

One of the most calming things that has happened to me recently was a friend of mine introducing me to one of his friends. She's actually 5 years younger than me, and I have no ulterior motives). We mostly play video games and take walks around town. It feels great because it's so simple. There's nothing complicated about it, and I don't feel like I have to be something that I'm not around her.

I wasn't in school this past semester because I'm not sure whether I passed my classes in the previous semester. Class itself can be a problem for me. I actually enjoy learning, and called the given number twice before I became too nervous that I was doing something wrong and never called back. I couldn't check my grades or assignments from that point on, and to this day have no idea if I passed all of or any of my classes. I also received a notice in the mail the other day saying that I owe ~$2000 to the school which FAFSA apparently didn't take care of. I barely make enough money to cover the gas I use on my job, and can see no way to come up with the money. I want to go back to school this next semester, but I don't know what effect this debt, or my grades will have on my further education. I'm completely terrified of asking for help, to the point where I will literally make myself sick over it.

I mentioned previously that I'm living with my parents still. I've actually had several different friends offer to get an apartment or a house with me (I'm incredibly easy going, and I always make up an excuse as to why I can't move out at the moment. I also feel like if I move out in the state I'm in now, I'll in a way have sealed my fate and have little chance of finishing up college.

I see nothing good about myself, it felt good to write it out.

TL;DR: I'm a 22 year old who lives with his parents, and is terrified of just about everything (including friends at times). I'm in a bit of debt, can't stick with anything, can't ask for help, and the most calming thing in my life is a high school girl that I play video games and take walks with. I have no idea what to do.

Lil Bit was such a good dog. My mother found her in 1998 ish, "" Why should I? This dog has been more loyal to me than you, and SHE deserves to be in my bed, not you!""  She even fought off a pit bull that attacked them on a walk, and had Lil Bit in its jaws. She beat it in the head with a 2x4 until it finally let go. Lil Bit carried the scars proudly , four punctures on each side of her chest. 

Years passed and my mom gave Lil Bit to my brother because she moved to California. I was busy raising my family. She really never wanted anything to do with me when she was with my mom

 She also had another litter of puppies to care for. I took her home with me

 She was my constant companion

 On Monday after her walk she had some sort of seizure. The vet said this could happen, "" Its OK, I'm fine! don't cry"" She was trying to comfort me. 

 My other dog Max knew something was very wrong and I could tell from his behavior this was the end for our Lil Bit. Me and my girls just sat there and cried, and the last thing I remember was her coming to my side of the bed and struggling to breathe. I got her on the bed and she curled up next to me. 

 Soon she was very still and I felt her spirit go. This was on Tuesday. We are all still so sad and cant believe shes not here. Even the pee stains on the carpet make me cry

I feel like she can never be replaced and how cruel it is that all good dogs cant just live forever.  I cant get over this heavy sense of grief.

I'm 29 years old. I'm currently studying a year diploma to get back on my feet. This is after two years of unemployment

Previously I was studying a masters

I was unemployed partly due to the economic situation, how would you feel having your son who is in his late 20s still living off you? The town I lived in was small and conservative and everyone was quite open about judging me. Add to that it was one of those dead end towns where everyone is forlorn and hopeless. 

I smoked pot to cope, as well as my shoulder being dislocated. As much as I want to please them, I felt like killing myself and my depression was quite unbearable.

So I applied for this diploma and bank loan

I have been trying to improve my life. I exercise and eat healthy. I don't have a partner. My friends

I'm trying hard to sort myself out. But I feel so scared. Today I got given the wrong directions by train officials so hopped on the wrong train and missed a conference about resume writing and getting a job in the field my diploma is for.

1364265605.0,1b0nlq,The person I love the most is going through hard times and is shutting me out,reddituserX0001,22,1,11,"Some background:

I’m a 24 year old guy who wasted most of his life away playing video games through highschool and most of college until a life changing experience changed my ways when I was 20. I tried to turn my life around and be more social. I made more friends, I started to feel like I would be alone forever. Most girls just walked away when they found out I was a 20 something year old virgin.

The story:

Right before my 24th birthday I met a girl on a dating site. We went out on a few dates and had a lot of fun together. It started to blossom into a real relationship. I will admit things went really fast. She told me she did have some mental issues like depression and some of her exes affected the way she saw guys and stuff. They were real assholes to her in so many horrible ways. We talked about it here and there and I was ok with starting something with her. She just wanted to be up front with me. A few days before my birthday we were cuddling on the couch and one thing led to another and I lost my virginity to her. We talked about it for a long time beforehand and she wanted to make sure I was ready and all that jazz. She was really sweet about it.

From that point forward we were “official.” Awesome…first girlfriend and I lost my virginity, she would get shorter with her texts, and she stopped wanting to have sex so much. She was about to start another job leaving her schedule with virtually no time for me according to her and I told her I was ok with it. Another week went by and we barley talked although I tried. Then one morning I get a strange phone call from her. Out of the blue she says she thinks we’re moving too fast and we need to slow down. I say ok…what do you want to do? She said we needed to stop having sex and kind of back up a bit and take things slow. I was ok with this although I couldn’t help but think something was up.

About two days later I get a text, family issues, past mental trauma from exes, not knowing where she was going in life, the list was pretty long. She said she was going to start going to therapy on a regular basis to try and help her along. She said she didn’t want to bring me down with her even though I said I supported her 100% and wanted to be by her side as she tackled her problems. As much as I pleaded with her it didn’t help. She did say that once she found herself and fixed her problems we may find ourselves together down the road. She walked out with me I bawled my eyes out as I gave her one final hug.

That wasn’t the end though. We still texted every day like nothing had happened. Sure we talked about us a little bit

We still text every day and she still calls me about every other day. I try to ask her how she is feeling, but she says I’m interrogating her and gets upset. So most of our calls consist of her venting to me about her day and me just listening. Every time she asks how I’m doing I don’t lie to her, I tell her I’m not doing well. I just want to be there to help her through this but she doesn’t want help. I love and care for her, but she wants none of it from me right now.

I end up really upset about every other day and cry a lot because I just can’t shake this feeling. She was my first girlfriend and I lost my virginity to her…I kind of expected to be with her for more than a few months.

I know exactly what I would tell someone if they were in my shoes right now. I would tell them to lay off, but to me I’m in this rut with walls higher than Mt. Everest. I feel like I’m going to be forever alone for the rest of my life.

How do I feel better?

It's true he cheated on her with me. I don't know if he told her or if she found out from scratchmarks. I feel horrible. She was my friend. But so is he and we've been friends for 6 years. We talk all the time and we're always there for eachother. I always try and help him. But we got drunk and he hopped on top of me. I said I didn't want to

I felt horrible but that doesn't excuse what I did. I knew he wasn't single. Now I have to face her at the mall when I want to bus somewhere. I have to know that I hurt someone so bad.

I never have done anything like that and urged him to talk to her. Hell he was saying shit to his ex when they were seeing eachother and made him fess up. He's not a terrible person

Then last night I saw a cute older guy. You know everyone has a fantasy of being with someone older and experienced. We got to a strip club

I feel so shitty like what the fuck is going on. I don't want to leave my house.

Noone ever says otherwise so I guess subconsciously that makes me think its more true.

My school work hasn't been great either. I go to a college prep school, I had an F in all four. I dont know what to do. Also, I have SATs and ACTs to take in the next 2/3 months. People keep asking what I want to do, but I honestly dont know. I graduate in 2 years, and I'm lost. I'm so alone.

I'm useless. I'm scared.

On top of that I'm severely depressed, and the only means of communiqué I have with my ""friends"" is Facebook and Skype. Of course any and every time I even sit in front of the computer I'm told Ive been sitting there for hours playing video games and told to go do something real. This is coming from my Mr. Mom, ""work at home"" father, who if you checked his internet history would be full of Youtube clips of old SNL sketches and Amazon reviews. Coupled with that, very rarely am I allowed out. Not that I have anywhere to go.

My 9 year old brother is a prick. He knows he's the favourite child and he flaunts it. My parents buy him expensive gifts, money I got by saving lunch money by not eating. I can't drive either, she knows this. It's not like we're short on cash either. My mother is a well paid doctor.

Because I had relatively free usage of the internet
   This would probably be all A-OK, what's this. K9 safe web parental tools pops up and informs me that I'm not allowed to access 4chan.org because it contains pornographic content. At this point I know I'm up a creek. I opened a new private tab to check some other sites, mainly pornhub and the like. All blocked by K9. I'm feeling pretty bad at this point. I guess when my dad used my laptop to email my essay, he poked around in my browsing history and found some 4chan stuff from yesterday and installed this parental control application. To make matters worse, I went on 7chan for the first time yesterday and explored some unsavory boards like /bestiality/ out of curiosity, shock, and horror.

When he committed suicide I was 18 years old. We found out that he was on the way to the hospital 2 days after I had attended my high school graduation. I was coming of a big emotional high for me. I hated school pretty bad because I was picked on throughout most of my time in the school system. It let up once I made it to high school. I didn’t respond right to my cousin’s suicide. I turned it inward and am now suffering from it. I wasn’t even in the ER room when they pulled the plug. My mom was, there’s no doubt about it. I don’t think could take any more abuse. He ended up shooting himself in front of his mother

Fast forward a few years and I now have an incarcerated uncle currently serving a 6 month stint for assault and he has a trial scheduled for the end of this month which could lead to an additional 2 years inside. All of this is due to the fact that he will not admit he has seizures from a fall that nearly killed him before I was even born. Couple that with an alcoholic enabling attention whore of a Grandma, but refused to get a license so she could get a ride everywhere almost every fucking day. Of course this is my mom’s responsibility because my grandma wants nothing to do with me. In turn my grandma will no longer think or do anything without my mom.
This brings me to my mom. She has got to be the most caring/loving person I know. She is the only consistent parental figure in my life. She has to put up with my dad who is an alcoholic who spends most of his days ignoring/brushing us off. I am pretty sure he hates me to the core of his being. He never cares unless I’ve done something wrong. In his eyes I am to be seen and not heard; I am to be constantly busy

I used to be strong, I feel it would only depress her more. I am in a tail spin and can’t seem to pull out of it.

1330042586.0,q3aqx,Well life just kicked me hard in the face.,theincomparableben,26,6,12,"I'm a middle child. My father has been a minister for the majority of my life

I've never been a great student, but didn't live there *until* 7th grade. So in turn, I had no friends until I made a few in middle school and in the high school band, and stuck with them ever since. However, these are the only real friends I have. They got me through high school, along with being in the band.

I dated twice. Period. Once in middle school that was a result of my stupidity at the time and no real love was involved on my part, less because I loved her, and more because I felt sorry for her. She'd lost her mom, and was stuck in a terrible family situation. She'd been obsessed with me for a while, and I didn't realize it until we started dating. I was a miserable SO. I always found reasons we couldn't go somewhere and be together. I finally broke up with her because I was doing more harm than good. Now, I've got a *huge* crush on one of my closest friends, who's already told me that every time a friend reveals they have interest in her

Since I've always been a bit of a musical individual, and I found out a couple of my friends played guitar/bass too. We set out to create a band of our own, and still haven't really gotten anywhere. It's been three years. I'm almost ready to start looking somewhere else for a band, but I'm convinced I'll never make it. My voice is too low to be considered good for rock, and gives out too quickly, despite being strong to begin with. I'm fairly clean on guitar, until you tell me to start playing the best I can, but I can't make myself happy with any of it

Recently I graduated my high school with top honors. I was in the class of 2011. Most of my friends graduated with honors as well. I was the only one that got accepted to a university's honors program. The university is in the same town that I went to high school in, it got worse. Once, I turned in a topic proposal to have it ripped to shreds by the teacher in my honors composition class. Eventually I was afraid to even go to class. At the end of the semester, I had a 0.54 GPA. This put me on academic probation and I was no longer permitted to take honors classes. I accidentally missed my advisement appointment and got so fucked in the registration process that I came out with only 8 credit hours, as opposed to the 14 I was taking the first semester. I started off badly in those classes as well, forgetting a paper and a textbook.

Then

Through all this at the university, but I still have the job. So this concerns me if I can keep the job. Because when I lose it, I can no longer pay for gas in my car (which needs repairs I can't pay for), subscriptions I've begun, or anything I've wanted for the past five years my parents wouldn't buy me (because we didn't have the money, or they were just being dicks).

I'm really no good at anything other than music production or some IT work (even in that area I'm just okay). So any job I get without landing it at the local music shop--which I've already learned will not hire me as a producer or engineer--is going to suck and it'll only make things worse.

I got extremely scared when my family asked me what my final grades were... so I lied and told them I had the makings of a solid 3.8. It's what they wanted to hear. It's what they expected of me. I appear as the guy that has it all together to literally *everyone* but my closest friends

I've also nearly lost my religion

That thing about everyone thinking I have it all together? Yeah. Most people truly believe that. A lot of people actually assume so because they don't care. No one cares about me

Throughout high school, I'm feeling like I'd be better off if I just fell into a coma and never woke up, or even died. At the same time, though, that scares me. I don't want to die, but I have no reason to live.

This past year has been rough (I'm 25

1) I joined AmeriCorps after 4 months of unemployment.  It's something.  I've really grown as a person and gained a lot of skills.  But I'm tired of feeling ashamed when I use my food stamps at the grocery store.  I'm tired of low income housing.  I'm tired of working 60 hours a week at my work site for less than minimum wage.  Management has been preoccupied with conflict and things falling apart

2)  Speaking of low income housing... I'm sick of getting ripped off by both my landlord and the building manager

An upstairs neighbor also tried to break into my bedroom in the middle of the night after harassing me for the past few months.  My landlord feels sorry for him (he's an addict with nowhere else to go) so he's still living here.  Landlord even tried to guilt trip me for complaining about it.  I regret not calling the cops now.  I bought a stungun.  I'm trying to move

3)  I can't get a job in what I studied (forensic science) for the life of me.  I have a Master's degree and a couple of years of experience volunteering in labs.  I get the door slammed in my face by HR for more qualified applicants

4)  I keep trying to get into other jobs

5)  I hate the city I currently live in.  I miss my old city.  Sometimes, in this job, being bored to death.

6)  Mostly friendless.  I moved across the country for this AmeriCorps position.  And it's hard to make friends with the hours I work and I have zero connections in the area

7)  I've been strung along for 2 1/2 years by the person I love (in love, dated, then became long-distance, and then reconnected when I moved out here.  I hoped things would be different once distance was no longer a problem for us, but it's not.  He's in a transitional state in his life, too.  He's starting his own company and is overworking himself to get it to run.  I've asked if he needs me to help him with anything, letting him know that I'm here if he needs me, we're not in a relationship and I'm facing the fact that there's no room in his life for me.  It's pretty crushing

I've never paid attention to Valentine's Day

1328370535.0,paovr,Remembering a friend lost last night,Heavenguard,26,3,2,"I just need to work it out a little

Last night, by my estimation, no less than 80 people came to see him. Honestly, I felt a little bad about how much real estate we were taking up; people literally lined up down the hall for a chance to say goodbye to him. I wondered how frequently the hospital saw a literal crowd of well-wishers for a single patient.  

Now, he lived it. He was so loved by others because he heaped love, openness, and kindness upon everyone he ever came across, and it was infectious. He had a an unending child-like innocence and enthusiasm to him. 

He loved to cook and eat, salad, soup, fish, ribs, and steak. The dude went all out for food. If we went out to eat, he'd try different things, we had ramen noodles with squid ink soup. It wasn't new for him, but at the same time usually threw him a bone and let him have just one bite

And it didn't stop there either. He and his wife are so generous with food. Not just serving it, my similarly-aged friends and I protested and tried to pay for ourselves, but they always told us ""When you're working, then you get to pay us back. But right now we're working and you're still in school."" Eventually we learned to stop resisting. Then I got my first full time job out of school, and I took them out to the Keg to eat. What did they do? They paid the bill. I couldn't fight them off because they were seasoned pros, I had no chance. Eventually I had to come up with with some strategies. This included simple ones like quickly snatching the bill before they could. More involved ones included leaving cash in the car console and calling them afterwards to tell them where it was, and excusing myself from the table to go to the washroom, and they came to call it ""Pulling a [my name]"". (And then they did it themselves on other friends who were equally as bill-grabby.)

He also loved to build Gundam models. He'd collected boxes and boxes of them, and when you're a pastor, especially one like him, you have an extremely busy schedule. When he got cancer 5 years ago and was forced to take a leave from work, he finally had the time to build his Gundam models. Oh, but he loved those models. He spent hours building and painting them. They were one of the silver linings he managed to find in the long, tiresome journey of his illness. Building the models helped him keep his mind off how terrible chemo and radiation therapy made him feel. But it wasn't just a distraction, and I had no clue what he was going on about, they were

He enjoyed camping and being outdoors and going on roadtrips with his wife. He was always very curious, because it reminded him of that generic yellow happy face. The man even had yellow overalls. Where do you even get yellow overalls???? When he was diagnosed with cancer for the third time, he knew his chances of seeing the other end of it was slim. He told us that if he died, he didn't want us to wear black at his funeral, he wanted us to wear something colourful. I can already imagine that it will be a sea of yellow that day. It's kind of a ridiculous picture, isn't it? But that's just who he is, and what will become a part of his legacy.

I think the most amazing thing about him was how he connected with everybody. Small children love him. Insufferably cocky teens love. His peers love him. And the elderly especially love him. He really got kids. Ministering to kids was his passion. He could really get down to a kid's level and really communicate with them. He was even caught up on the latest toy fads and kids TV shows. I've never been sure if he was caught up so he could talk about it with the kids

His completely non-judgmental openness and gentle way of mentoring people let teens connect with him. You know the kids who're too cool for you? The I'm really awesome kids? Yeah, waiting to say goodbye. He was so real and genuine and never talked down to anyone, and it was so subtly powerful that he brought people down to that level too. He listened intently no matter what you had to say, and if you had an issue, he'd give you the wisdom of his experience if you wanted it. But mostly, he was just so fun that you just wanted to play too, and you can't be a pretentious teen or snobby adult and play. You have to be like a kid to play

He was so kind, I know he had a few gripes and annoyances with them, but he was gentle about it and usually just let them have their way if it was simply just a difference of opinion. He and his wife welcomed them into their home when they moved here. He took them out to eat. When an additional car was needed, he bought a new car and gave it to them and kept the old one for himself. His MIL said she knew he was good to them and she loved him like he was her own son. She didn't even see her son very much, but he was always there (well, I mean, living in the same house and all).

Oh, because the need to see them meant there was something wrong that needed fixing. But he appreciated them so much for all they did for helping him. He didn't just tell them so, he'd show them his appreciation in the form of food. He and his wife got them coffee, snacks, and  chocolates. I visited him in the hospital last week, and I don't think there was a single nurse who walked by without saying hi to him and his wife.

I am trying to think of a negative thing about him. It's like one of those trick questions on interviews: What is your biggest weakness? And then you have to answer in a way that's actually a positive. That's actually the only kind of answer I can come up with. He'd work too hard and exhaust himself. They were too generous. (Not that it put them in a compromising financial situation

The last five years have been hard on him and very especially his wife. He was diagnosed with cancer one, what does he do? He poses with it with a grin and a peace sign. He was home for about two days before he was taken to the ER for shortness of breath. He'd gotten pneumonia, and given his extremely decreased lung function, this was life threatening to him. He was put on a ventilator because he couldn't breathe on his own anymore. Despite the antibiotics and whatever else he was put on, he went into sepsis. His organs shut down and, two days later, finally his heart did too. He was with family. 

As a favour to him, but try to eat well and stay healthy.

My family feels like it's getting less and less supportive over my endeavors of finding a job. It's hard enough trying to go around the city passing resumes to hospitals that just tell you to ""go home"" because no jobs are available to nurses at the moment here.

I love what I do; I have no regrets. 

I just... feel so trapped. With no income and my family just seeming to not care anymore I can't go get the extra credentials shit these hospitals ask me of. 

My boyfriend and his mother are amazing and just... she told me she'll pay for the training I'm needing and is not even letting me say no. I love them to death and am grateful for her gift to me...

... but I'm hurt because it feels like my own family has abandoned me. I got the highest grades of all my siblings. I've done everything they wanted me to and more. I excel in everything I put my heart into.

But I feel so unloved; none of my accomplishments in the past and present seem enough for them and while I have my diploma and high averages my sisters get all the nice things I only wished I could have. At their age

And everything given to me is second hand while they all just pull out a leg and an arm just to give them new things.

""I think we should break up."" The six words that get me every time. Every. Single. Fucking. Time.

Of course we should break up. All I've done is tell her how beautiful she is. How happy she makes me. How I just want to be with her. But of course we should break up. It isn't like I've given her all the affection I could muster or anything. That'd just be silly.

But wait

""I cheated on you.""

Okay

Not only do I have to go to work tomorrow

Of course

In any other circumstance, but I would be fine. The fact that she fucking cheated on me, though... it makes me angrier than I knew possible. I gave her **everything** and in return all I get is impending sadness.

1361473000.0,18yw6n,My school work is driving me crazy and I feel like I'm going to explode.,summerbandicoot,21,1,8,"Warning - wall of text coming up. Might not make much sense.

 So here's my deal: I'm a second semester senior in college and I'm going nuts. I go to a school where everyone is required to do a senior project/thesis, which requires us to choreograph two pieces (one per semester) of about 10-15 mins length, and a paper that's 20-30 pages. My other is for philosophy and the project is a paper of 65-125 pages. I knew what I was getting myself into when I decided to double, so I know I'm the only one to blame for that...and there's no way I'm quitting one when I'm this far along.

The dance project I'm not so worried about. It's my philosophy project that's really starting to drive me mad. Before I left for break I had about 35 pages written, and I have to read a ton of books for my research (mostly, I just need more quotes and references put in since I have almost none). I've read a few, but really not much. Obviously, I should have started reading these texts a while ago, but my focus before was getting all my existing ideas out on paper and such, plus...reading for school is the thing I'm literally worst at. I'm that person who immediately has 200x more trouble reading something once it's assigned for a class. Plus philosophy readings are hard and take time. But it needs to be done! But I'm having so much trouble doing it. I still have 2-3 chapters of my project that I haven't even begun writing. Usually I see my project adviser every week, and we have a meeting tomorrow

Another issue is that because I'm a double major, and the philosophy department too. So basically, while all the other seniors are taking one or two classes this semester, I'm taking five, and so all that schoolwork is factored in too. Plus I'm in two other dance pieces. I feel like I can't juggle this all, and especially not while keeping my sanity. I don't want to turn into a hermit and stop going out/seeing my friends...mostly because I know this would probably make me horribly depressed. But I need to get more work done and I need a way to make myself do it. And I need a way of feeling okay missing out on partying/going out on some weekends. Right now it just feels like I'm not doing anything productive enough (although I have been trying to do some work every day) or like anything I'm doing just isn't enough. I feel like I've lost track of my train of thought with this project and am afraid I won't find it again. Basically I'm just super anxious about how the hell I'm going to finish this thing and I feel like I'm going absolutely insane. A couple minutes ago I actually started crying in the library. I know this is probably very trivial compared to a lot of posts here but if you have anything encouraging or helpful to say I would really appreciate it. Thanks r/MMFB.",,,,

Earlier this year I made the decision (under a doctor's care) to withdraw from psychiatric medications for a bunch of reasons that I still stand by today. I'd been coping pretty damn well, possibly an eating disorder) and the stress is making me symptomatic.

I basically have this fucking Greek chorus of...I don't want to say voices, and I'm definitely not. But it's like a bunch of internal monologues going on at any given moment, and they're all goddamn bullies. It's like getting picked on by a group of people who follow you around at all times, know every secret, every thought, every insecurity you have, and they exploit all these things in their criticism. 

Even the stuff I see as a personal victory isn't safe at this point. I got a job and was really excited about it (after three years of being disabled I felt super pumped that I'd even felt up to putting in an application) and posted something about it on Facebook. About 30 people ""liked"" the post, anyone can do that in their sleep. Your sister's a medical assistant and your boyfriend is Defending Our Freedom and you're excited to be making lattes for minimum wage? You're pathetic. Look at all these people who are congratulating you -- they feel sorry for you. They know what a fuckup you are and they're trying to be encouraging about your sorry excuse for a job because they know it's all you can even handle right now. They're not excited for you, they pity you because you have no ambition and will never amount to anything in life. You might as well kill yourself now, you don't have any purpose or worth, just give up and spare everyone the misery of having to deal with your dumbshit ass for the next 40 years.""

It's like this with everything. Every move I make, they find a way to make it into my fault because I'm a worthless sack of shit. There's a monologue for everything that's going on, sometimes there are five or six at once, and I can fight one off but the rest just get louder. 

This has been with me constantly throughout my life since I was a child, stress level was lower than it's been in years, and as a result the monologues were quieter and found less to criticize. But then, like I said, I hit a stressful period, and it's ramped up until it's the worst I've had to deal with it in recent memory. 

I can't fucking do it anymore. I am afraid to act because I'm so tired of feeling like every action I take is going to make everyone hate me and I'll be alone and miserable for the rest of my life, and of course when he gets frustrated the monologue changes to ""do you really think he's going to keep putting up with your bullshit for much longer..."" etc. 

I can't win against my own mind. It knows exactly which insecurities to exploit from moment to moment. I can do nothing to please it. Sometimes I can turn down the volume

She became a heroin addict and ended up moving something like a thousand miles away to be with him and live with his father. Things didn't work out there, and she ended up moving back about a week or so before Christmas of 2010. She got off of the drugs, broke up with him, got a job, got a place to live

And then he showed up at her work when she got off

He told her that he just wanted to apologize to her for everything. Said that he had gotten off of the heroin and felt bad about everything he had put her through. Jess was, I'd go so far as to call her naive. She let him go home with her. That was the last night she was alive.

heres where problems arised: her mother and stepfather decided to not approve of me, her little brother and sister were told to stay awar from me. but that didnt stop her and I from loving each other. her real father loved me to death and loved how i took care of her and did everything in the world for her. she would spend time over my house with my family and friends, who took her in right away and made her a part of our life, our family.

I did everything in the world for her that i could, help her with schoolwork, supported everything that she wanted to do, and was always there for her, 200%. I loved her, and i never made her feel less important than anything else in the world. i even threw her a surprise 21 bday party at my house with all of her friends from school waiting at my house, something that shes always wanted. i loved her more than anything else

cut to three years later. a boy in her class ( i graduated from school the same year i met her) had been constantly attempting to get with her while we dated. he would call her at all hours of the night asking her to come over from my house and cuddle with him in bed, only to go right back with her when realizing that no other girl wanted to talk to him. hes also a major liar and mentally unstable, claiming to have attempted to kill himself as well as some bullshit story about him and his friend killing a drug dealer in an abandoned warehouse when they were in middle school, and never told anyone. he plays guitar, poet, and pretty much the pretentious hipster tortured artist stereotype that will come into your head. hes an asshole. well she started hanging out with him on a regular basis, and started staying over. her mother and stepfather got the four of them tickets to an expensive show and dinner

cut to this past june, her mother made her break up with me. it was painful.

three days later she calls me to hang out, although she wants to keep it a secret from her mom and stepdad. things seemed really happy again.

cut to october, since i found out the day after halloween that she was going over that boy's house behind my back and sleeping with him while with me. it went on for three weeks.

Here's the story: I'm terrible with women. I'm in my early/mid 20's and I'm a virgin. In high school I fell in love with a girl and tried to get her to notice me for years, which I somehow managed to do. It took two years before I stopped thinking about her every day.

Because of that, thinking they were far above my league. So I didn't do any dating in college, never went to any parties or events because I'm nauseated by the smell of alcohol and loud noises hurt my ears, among other reasons.

But I was perfectly all right with being alone. I convinced myself that it was something that wouldn't change

At any rate, both of us are there for about seven months. I'm friendly towards her, but no moreso than I'd be to anyone else.

One day I'm down in a storage room processing some deliveries when Lillian comes in to pick up something. She sits down and we have a chat, what are we going to do about this?"" I mentally scramble trying to figure it all out when soon it becomes apparent to me: she likes me. To be more accurate, she *likes* me.

Armed with this newfound knowledge, I find some way of screwing it up. But I went for it anyway.

Monday comes around and we leave the office together to go see a movie. It was January and cold as shit as we waited outside the theatre

The date went quite well. The movie we saw wasn't the best thing ever

The film ends and the time comes for me to muster my courage to ask for a kiss. I try to surreptitiously apply chapstick while walking out of the theatre and I notice her applying some kind of lip gloss or something at the same time. A voice in my head says: ""Pinky

""So Lillian, but would it be all right if I-""

""Yes.""

""...kissed you?""

""Yes.""

After a little bit of positioning. I moved in for my first kiss ever. The first ""phase"" of the kiss was a bit off, this time I was getting the hang of it, but I must have done something screwy because I think I felt her teeth at one point. Finally, at the third ""phase"" the magic happened. It was wet and juicy and loud and amazing. If I close my eyes I can still feel my lips pressed against hers'. I wish I could stop the world at that one moment, because everything in it was exactly right at that moment. For the first time in my life, I understood what real happiness felt like. The only thing I could think to say to her after that was a whispered ""wow.""

So the date ended and on the train ride home I'm elated beyond all description. I felt exhilarated and free and alive in a way I had never known before. She had told me at the end that we should do it again sometime, that I cannot read signals at all and was totally unschooled in the ways of dating ettiquete. Remember this fact, as it will be important momentarily.

The next day at work I found it difficult to keep at my usual job with her sitting twelve feet away from me (obviously our co-workers didn't know about our date). My whole life seemed so much brighter at that moment and I couldn't have been happier. This, alone. I turn to her and say:

""I don't know how I'm going to explain to my parents that I have a girlfriend now.""

You know how people often talk about what they would do if they had a time machine? This sentence. I'd go back in time and kick my past self in the balls before he could utter this sentence. This is possibly the worst decision I've made in my entire life; I honestly thought that was how it worked, Lillian was taken quite aback at this and left the office weirded out. Idiot me took about two days to realize the magnitude of what I had done and I tried to apologize to her in letter form (where it would be more difficult to misspeak) but the damage had already been done.

The following week, even a little bit, and that she had essentially already given me that. However, by now I could see that I wasn't going to get anywhere and we parted semi-amicably.

That date was six months and twelve days ago today. Since then I've made ten attempts to converse with women, but the result is always the same: eventually they just stop talking to me and pretend like I don't exist. I think that's what hurts me the most, actually: at least if they insulted me I would know they put some effort into responding to me and acknowledged my existence.

Meanwhile

Last night I made another attempt to talk with a woman on the train coming home. I started with small-talk about the lack of air conditioning, something snapped inside me and I just started crying. I haven't cried in years but I couldn't stop myself.

That night I tried to go to sleep but I'd keep waking up crying and I couldn't stop myself. I just kept thinking about how I don't deserve any kind of romance or relationship in my life because I'd just find a way to destroy it like I did with Lillian (Lillian insists that I deserve someone, because now I know the state of pure joy that will forever elude me, now all I see on the streets are couples, and every time they hold hands or draw themselves nearer to each other I get sick to my stomach, knowing that I'll never be able to experience that beautiful emotional connection to another human being. I don't even really care about sex or anything like that, I just want someone who I can complain to and who can complain to me, someone to share joy and misery

I have so much love I could give to someone and no one to give it to. I feel like I just want to stop existing. I don't want to kill myself; that wouldn't accomplish anything. I just don't want to keep going through the process of living, she'll probably either ignore me or give me some pat advice and then go on with her life. Although it isn't as though I'd want to bother her with all this anyway; I've already dragged her through enough of my problems and I'd hate myself if I caused her any more distress.

So there it is. Someone make me feel better. Or don't. I don't care. I don't matter very much anyway.

I just have a lot of things in my life that are stressing me out to the point where I'm just continuously sad. I try to do all the things and surround myself with the people that I know make me really happy

My schoolwork is stressing me out beyond belief and I feel like there are never enough hours in a day to get all my work completed

I feel like I can't make any of my friends happy because I can't clone myself into 20 people and be there when they want me to be there. My roommate continuously gets pissed when I'm not in the room for an extended period of time, etc. I also get the lectures of ""You really shouldn't be doing this because..."". She openly admits to being an introvert, which is perfectly fine. She loves to be on her MacBook. I'm just a little more extroverted and choose to not stay put for many hours at a time. But everytime I go somewhere, I feel bad knowing she's upset that I'm not there. She had a bad experience with her last roommate not being around much. Its not only her, but a lot of my other friends want me in lots of other places. They just get mad when I can't be everywhere, making me feel like a complete failure and that I'm good for nothing except hurting people. 

My relationship is slowly falling apart... in my eyes. I've dated my boyfriend for almost three years now. He's 20 and I'm 18. We go to two different colleges. The long distance isn't the problem, but it can't be me. 

But I'm afraid... Because our relationship has been 3 years in length

Another reason for this is because I've met someone here... 
Someone I care for a whole lot... And he's told me he feels the same.
But he also has a girlfriend... and his relationship, but ever since we admitted to having feelings for one another, we've kept our relationships out of our conversations. We're both honest people and we haven't done anything physically, but our feelings have become more in depth. 

He and his girlfriend meet up on the weekends She's 16 and still in high school; both of them from the local area. The day they hang out
Despite the fact I wish it was me, and she is really pretty. Seeing how happy she is with him, I would hate to see her get hurt... And I would feel absolutely horrible if I ended up being the reason why, despite the fact I barely know her. 

I know it sounds odd to say that last statement in a way, they won't feel sorry at all whatsoever. I'm not catty, and I don't believe in having no emotion or sympathy for the other party. I seriously would feel bad if I was the reason she'd have her heart broken. But seeing them together... it really hurts... The thought of the fact I can't be the one that makes him happy... breaks me. Really rips me to shreds. 

I'm very particular in who I confide in, I just feel like they wouldn't understand. I would confide in the close guy friend I've come to basically fall in love with, but that's the worst thing to do when it involves him and his girlfriend, so I don't even consider talking to him about it.

Long time lurker here with a new account, this really fucking sucks.  I feel torn up inside at what to do...i want to do the right thing but i'm torn and feel myself just struggling to not feel incredibly depressed about this whole thing.  

This may be a ramble, thoughts, or even just a couple words of encouragement that we'll make it through this without my family being torn apart.

Quick background on me: I'm the husband in a very happily married for a couple of decades now and my daughter is and always has been the apple my my eye.  My wife and I also have a son, daddy's girl and all that.  She was a great baby and overall we made it through all the typical ""difficult"" years (terrible twos, terrible tweens) without, from my perspective, it being too difficult at all.  My wife stayed home for about 13 years with our daughter and son (who is younger).  I struggled with depression since my younger teenage years and finally accepted help in my mid-30's.  I am currently, by choice and guidance from my doctor, unmedicated.  The mental tools i've developed over the past few years work to keep me floating peacefully...and I can move through all the worry, but I've also really worked on that aspect of myself.

Quick background on her: She's a smart girl...driven beyond belief...loyal to a fault...she may even really have a type-a personality with a great sense of humor.  She has struggled, unfortunately runs in the family on my side.  She goes to a local private school, but lives at home because she also rides horses which we keep at our house.  We currently pay for her car (it's the 3rd one for her...she's totaled the prior 2) so she has some modicum of freedom and because of her schedule (riding, school and work), having only 2 cars is not an intelligent option.  She works part time and uses her money for various things but primarily on gas and to help us offset the cost of keeping the horses (feed, vet, farrier) and goes to school full-time.  She also has some decent privacy at home.  She's got a full schedule and has goals in school and for riding her horses to prepare for show season.  She is the opposite of lazy...she words hard.  I'm proud of her and her dedication and her work ethic.  

But...it's like pulling teeth to ask her to help us with something.  Her and I can only carry on the most casual of conversations because many times when i ask her for help things either don't get done or they get done in a half-assed manner then gets angry at me for pointing out how half-assed they are.  So

Last year, well, not what I want to repeat.  So reigning in my expectations were intentional and, you know what, it was very insightful to feel like maybe I was the cause of some of the animosity.  So, I pulled back and tried not to be such an asshat about things.  I worked on lowering my smartass attitude and having a longer fuse.  My wife knows I did and I'm proud of how I was able to step back from feeling so frustrated.  From, at times, overall

I go to school myself, but I calmly illustrated what i needed, at which, she had a nice healthy yell at me that she would do it on Wednesdays for me.

My wife, and this has happened a few times since I dedicated myself to being more patient where I really feel like my daughter is a genuine bitch.  I've been stewing on her reaction since last night and can't come to another conclusion other than she doesn't feel any need to help us out without a fight.  We don't hold the things we do for her or the things she has over her head as threats because that would drive her away.  We do these things because we love her...we love her a lot.  I'm lucky to have such a great family...but Reddit, i'm tired of the fight for help. 

It has driven me to the point of asking her to move out.

But I worry.  As a father I worry she won't finish school.  As a father I don't know how she can support herself?  Can she move into the dorms and then just pay the price of having that debt over her head?  I worry I am overreacting to what is typical behaviour for an 18 year old...that I should just learn to deal with it.  We all make the bed we have to sleep in and so I have no doubts that she's a result of her upbringing

She has a scholarship which pays for about half of her school and the rest is on loans.  My wife and I have a life to lead and I wonder when it's time to push her from the nest.

Maybe i'm not looking for answers

tl;dr - want the best for our responsible 18 year old who lives at home

My boyfriend is 30-something and recently moved back in with his parents, and is (obviously) really depressed.

Today, I saw a side of him I rarely see, and when I see it, it scares the shit out of me.

He started babbling about ""being more open"" and needing to ""speak up"". He felt immense resentment that he's not as ""successful"" as his peers. He also told me that if it wasn't for me

He was also stumbling around his room, I gave him some Ativan/lorazepam, and he kind of reverted back to someone closer to himself.

Needless to say, but I'm about to leave my part-time job at the end of the month and am going to school full-time with student loans. Even if I kept my part-time job, I don't work nearly enough hours nor make enough money to even pay for my phone bill half the time.

Before I begin

We/I lost a good friend today. A person I've known for many years. The kind of guy that's always smiling

We were having a good night yesterday. Just hanging out in our own little clubhouse, the same thing we do every week. Making plans for the weeks to come... Something we do every saturday. Most of us left a bit early, but his 3 best friends stuck around. They got into a little argument, they asked him to come to a big party, where the rest of us were, he didn't want to, and being a little drunk, stopped half way

An hour or so later, his 3 best friends get a text, saying ""I hope you regret this, for the rest of your life"". Being at a party, and never being confronted by a suicide before, they didn't think to much of it, neither did we.

The morning after, the guy has the tendency to just crash somewhere in our bar, to go pick him up. He walks around our bar, to find his own brother, hanging in the middle of our forest.

This afternoon we got a call. Everyone involved in our organisation had to come down, I knew something was wrong. Maybe an accident or something.

I step out of the car

I'm not sure what to feel right now. On one hand

But most of all, combined with guilt that I'm allready trying to get passed this...

A little over a year ago I was hospitalized for about a week. I had apparently accidentally overdosed on prescription medication (I remember taking 1 or 2 pills of my medication and next thing I know I am in a hospital). That is a whole different story in and of itself,000. 

I got a few calls from the hospital, I neglected their calls. Nowadays, I get about a call from them a week. In the message they say that they have a ""limited time settlement offer."" I KNOW I should call them back, but I can't bring myself to do it. I get incredibly anxious just thinking about it. I had to force myself just to write this.

I have thought of bankruptcy, especially considering I have sold as much of it as I could (books, movies, games) just to make minimum payments on my cards. Furthermore, the collections agency has placed a mark on my credit and is now a very poor score.  I have no idea if bankruptcy is even the right thing to do in this situation.

I have no job; though I have ramped up my job search in recent weeks (have been applying to places like Best Buy, grocery stores, pizza places, etc). I expect to graduate at around this time next year. But this whole situation is constantly looming over my head. This summer isn't helping; now that I am out of school, I have so much free time I do nothing else but think.

Alright, and I've been on and off with this one chick, I've never dated her, and I liked her, oh and I've also never had a girlfriend or hooked up with a girl before. Basically, today me and her hung out (since almost a year ago), and my intention was to hook up with her.. which I did, I hugged her a lot.. And here's where the bad part begins.. You see.. my parents, I found a quick solution.. I told my parents ""Hey

However.. As I was driving her home, I see your car, why are you driving here?"" I said I was showing my ""friend"" around my other house.. And they are like ok, wave to us as we pass by. And I'm like for sure.. This is where it all goes wrong.. They notice that I'm riding with a chick.. and my mom calls and starts bashing her, saying she's a prostitute and she's too skinny and a crack addict (which is totally not the case).. But then I tell my mom I'll talk to her later.. Which I did.. But before so, I dropped her off at her house, and I told her I've been meaning to do something for a while, and I made out with her.. Feeling great, my mom always confuses me with her brother (my uncle) who lives in Poland. There was a time when he was around my age and he dated a prostitute

Basically she went like this:
""She does all sorts of drugs, she will mooch you out of all your money *sob sob sob*, she will mess up your mind and you will instantly fail at life and you will be destroyed, she has no goals in life (yes she does, she's going to college).. She is a whore bla bla bla, youre just like your uncle, same exact mindset""..

Alright, but honestly, I couldn't tell them straight up that I'm going to hang out with a chick, everyday.. would be like ""how was it with her?"" ""how is she?"" ""what is she doing?"" ""bla bla bla"", and my dad... well my dad would tease me about it constantly, and they'd whine about how they ""pre-selected"" women for me that would fit me great... REALLY? It's not the 1660's. And I don't talk to them, and I honestly don't feel like it...

To add, all you people with normal parents be happy that you have normal parents..

But the trouble doesn't end here... My car (1987 camaro IROC-Z) was running fine all day when I was with the girl.. Started up fine every time.. Guess what? Parked it outside my house.. Next thing you know, or any of that spiritual crap exists, but things like this really make me wonder..

My apathetic world-view is killing my chances at a normal life/relationship. All my life I have never really committed to anything - quitting any club or activity if I even bothered to join it in the first place. I am generally dispassionate and dispirited about everything - although the rare times I show interest in something I can be very passionate about it. If I were to guess, and like I said I don't connect the dots to the prosperous rewards down the road. Someone tell me I'm a stupid, over-priviliged yuppie. So, big deal, you might say. Almost every student/person my age is uncertain about their future. Well, I can deal with carving out my academic/professional life. The biggest problem with my apathy is its affect on my love life (or lack thereof).

I'm fairly reclusive now. I live in a house with other room mates, and play video games (although recently I don't even want to play video games).  Although I don't think I'm hard to get along with, I just can't fathom beginning a relationship with anyone. Even if I did meet someone, what would I say?

I don't actually want to spend the time with anyone, I've always naively figured that I would eventually just find my soul mate.

This has only become an issue for me recently. I know I'm still young, but not only do I not have a girlfriend at the moment, it's been almost ten years since I was in any sort of relationship - and none of those were serious relationships, I'm lucid enough to realize that I've never been in love.

As stated, it's just that my apathy knows no bounds. Even if I see a girl I find attractive, my mind immediately goes into dismissive mode: ""What the hell would you do together?""

I know it's hard to follow my ramblings

  * In January I hit ice, seeing him unconscious slumped over me, blood all through the cab. He made a quick recovery and jokes about it now, but I still feel bad.

  * In February
    
  * In March, had just a minimum wage job, and my family was paying for my schooling. Then, it seemed I met the girl of my dreams (guess how this ends). We clicked immediately and the more time I spent with her, the closer I got. We both respected the sort of mutual agreement that it wouldn't last or we couldn't get too serious. Every time we were intimate, I never pushed her for anything, something I kind of pride myself on.

  * In April, just empty lonely feelings. On top of this, I almost failed 2 classes.

  * In May, 3rd degree burn over much of my right leg and was gimpy for a couple months.

  * In June, and punctured my side on something submerged. At least I have nice battlescars now.

  * In July, financial, etc. arguments ensue and I felt I had to mediate them. Now, in no way had I ever expected this. 25 years my parents had been married with hardly any smears on their relationship. Then, late in the month, I got the call. Dad was leaving Mom. I immediately called him and just...broke down. I've never cried so hard if at all. I lost all respect for him and all my sympathy went to Mom. I also got 3 points on my license for rolling through a stop sign.

  * August, I don't know.

  * September, and every weekend my HS friends came up and wanted to party and drink. Fun at first until they start becoming drunken assholes and I increasingly have less fun and worry about them.

  * October, my 21 y.o. sober friend drove me back to my house so I can get my wallet I forgot. On the way there, a cop pulls us over, sees that I've been drinking and writes me up for underage drinking. I want to be a teacher. I NEED to get this off my record, but it's now December and I've heard nothing. A week later, my boss calls me to say he's letting me go because of insurance purposes, what with the accident and 3 points on the license. (I was a delivery driver). Well

  * November. I'm down. I think I may have depression

  * December (so far)

  Now I'm left with a sense of what else can go wrong. The 3 times I've gotten laid can all be attributed to alcohol and I have no potential for any serious relationship, either. Advise, tips? Anybody been through similar years and came out stronger?

We arranged to have our belongings picked up on November 12th and shipped on November 15th. When they showed up to pick up our belongings it was a different company called Troy Moving. We asked why they were there and the driver told us they were hired to bring our belongings to A-2-Z's warehouse because they don't have small trucks. We thought nothing of it. It turned out Troy was subcontracted by A-2-Z to move our stuff to Kelowna. 

During the process of them loading the approached my husband and told him that there will be a charge because they have to carry our stuff down stairs. We told them no

We left on November 15th to get to Kelowna. On November 20th I emailed the moving company asking if they had an ETA of when we could expect our belongings to arrive and got no response. On November 21st we arrived in to our new rental apartment. On November 22nd I called the moving company first thing in the morning to find out an ETA. They said they didn't know and would call me back. I waited all day with no return phone call so I called them about 40 min before they closed. I was put on hold for 20 min and forgotten about. I hung up and called back and was told they still had no idea where the truck was and when it wold be arriving. The only information she could give me was that I would get a call 24 hrs before delivery. 

After spending a couple nights in our new apartment we had secured before we moved (I had a friend check it out for me) we realized we could stay there. It was not soundproofed from the upstairs suite and continuously interrupted our daughters sleep. We found a new place quickly and let the landlords know we would be moving at the end of December. 

It worked out that my Aunt and Uncle were leaving on November 29th and would be gone until after new years. They let us know we could house sit for them and have our belongings delivered there instead since it was much closer to our new apartment than the apartment we were currently renting. It also meant we would have a bed to sleep in and pots and pans to cook with. We were at the time sleeping on an air mattress and had camping cookware. I emailed the moving company on November 26th to let them know we had a new address for the delivery. They never responded. I called them on November 28th to see if they had gotten my message and they said no

The invoice we received was for $3414.88. I was blown away, which I think is high) and including the 10% discount the total I should be paying is $2239.27. They changed the quote to $3330. They changed one charge, the Kelowna surcharge. I emailed them back again telling them I was only paying what I was quoted. I never got a response back. 

The truck didn't show up on December 1st it showed up on December 3rd. I had a bank draft made out for the price I had told them I was paying. The driver wouldn't unload the truck until I payed him and I didn't want to pay him until he unloaded and I could see everything was there and nothing was broken. He refused so I called the Police. They arrived within 10 minutes. I showed the driver the cheque and he said it didn't match the invoice he had for $3330 so he again wouldn't unload. I explained the emails and he said he's just a driver and called the office. They told us pay the amount on the invoice or we don't get our stuff and they will take it to storage and hold it there until we pay. I said am not paying so they might as well take it to storage until we figure this out. The Police told me they couldn't make them give us our belongings but did think they were scamming us (implied and not in those words). We asked the driver for his number before he left and he wouldn't give it to us. After cooling down and talking to some people we decided to pay the invoice and take them to Small Claims Court. We called the moving company to ask them to send the truck back and they were closed

December 3rd was a Saturday. On Monday Dec 5th we called them to let them know we were willing to pay and to please send the truck back.They claim the driver left our stuff in the truck over night and tried to store it on Sunday here in Kelowna. They said nothing was open so they took our stuff to Calgary, we received an email stating that there was now another charge on top of the $3330 of $1450. We had to pay all that if we wanted them to deliver or belongings. 

We have to borrow money from family and use all of the money we have to pay what wasn't covered by my husbands new job. This means no buying groceries

**TL:DR** We hired a moving company and they are extremely overcharging us and holding our belongings hostage and there is nothing we can do but pay them.

**Edit**The $4000 included meals

**Edit** Grammar

**UPDATE** We told the moving company that we would pay and asked for a delivery date. They told us Dec 22nd was the earliest and they wouldn't guarantee that there wouldn't be more charges. In light of that we have arranged for a family member that lives in Calgary to rent a truck and bring our belongings to us. The moving company told us if we do that we just have to pay the $3330

My parents have done everything in their power to help him. They've driven 8 hours to get to a hotel and treatment facility, are currently sending him back and forth between mental hospitals. He's not getting any better, and every time they go to visit him, he says he can't wait to get back to breaking the law, which is the only thing keeping him going at the moment. 

Because he has aspergers, but now that's all changed. It doesn't feel like home without him, and It's getting progressively lonely, with me actually having a breakdown at school once.

It's incredibly hard to change him, typically what first satisfies him/her, so he has fixated on stealing/breaking the law. He's even gone into jail, made us go to court, and cost huge amounts in fines. Please, if you can, MMFB and suggest ways we can help him. He loves to code and do anything on computers, is fixated on Runescape

About a year back, got into therapy, started exercising, about 6 months ago I moved out into the countryside with my father and started working and socializing where I could. I was doing good. Even met a girl, online but it was something, you know?

This last month or so everything has gone to shit. 

Things with the girl fell apart. It wasn't anything bad and I'm not angry about the circumstances. Things were just going better than the distance between us would allow

My stepmother lost her job, gardening, lumber, etc.) while searching for a full-time job (still doing this, still no luck). We're slowly starting to lose various utilities as we can't pay the bills, and we're desperately trying to find a new place to live. Hard times are nothing new to me. I'm not concerned about where things will end up, they'll work out.

I started to lose a lot of sleep a couple weeks ago. I'd sleep for an hour, and I became more haunted by this than I ever had before in my life.

I made a final push to get out of the friend zone with my friend. Rejected again. I can't handle the pain of being around them anymore, no work, therapy isn't working out very well because I can only afford to see them once a month, I'm losing my home. I feel like my progress is coming completely undone faster than I can react to it.

The final straw that caused me to write this post just happened a little while ago. I was looking forward to today. Gorging myself on food, I chip a fucking tooth. First bite of Thanksgiving food, and I chip a *FUCKING* TOOTH. Suddenly I'm livid with anger at everything in my life, and I'm not an angry person. I've spent my life avoiding anger because my childhood was ruined by angry people.

1313560419.0,jlbcy,I married a Schizophrenic.,DirtyWhoreMouth,26,7,14,"I'm 23 and my husband is 27. We've been together since 2007 and married since 2010. Being young and staying married is hard enough without a mental illness

When we met

He would stop by my restaurant every day and drink a cup of coffee and watch me. All my co-workers were jealous of me. ""Why isn't he here to see meeee?"" they would wine. I felt so alive back then. He made me feel amazing.

We hit it off immediately. It didn't take long for us to move quickly. It seems like the first three months of our relationship was about sex. On his bed, the back of my Jeep, the back of his father's car, his grandparents' guest room bed. It was exhilerating. But it didn't stay that way. Before things could become more serious, he informed me of his illness. At the time, he was 24. He told me he had been diagnosed with Schizophrenia when he was 20. I was intrigued and almost found it exciting, being the weird kid that I was. I was into (and still am) morbid shit. Boy

I had problems at home with my parents. I wanted to move, he had a decent job making $11/hour. I had a shitty fast food job making $6.50/hour. We scraped along for the first couple months .... and then he quit. Abruptly. Quit. He hated his boss. I flipped out and demanded that he find a new job so we wouldn't become homeless. He found a gas station job but kept it less than a year. It ended with a screaming match between him and his assistant manager. This is when he decided to tell me that this gas station job was his 32nd job in less than 10 years.

He told me that the medicine he was on wasn't really working and he couldn't shake the feeling that everyone he came into contact with was making fun of him. This angered him to the point of wanting to kill innocent customers - something he could only stifle with his cigarettes. I remember he smoked a lot back then

I was devastated.

He decided to try one more time to hold a job. This time he got a job at Wal-mart as an overnight stocker. He was left in a little room with a computer, had a massive panic attack and walked out of the store. I think he had been there five hours.

With the help of his mother, but I stepped up and took the challenge. It turns out that a person can't be working for a year (thus proving their inability to work), so he wasn't allowed to even attempt another job for at least a year. This killed him, but he obliged. 

I ended up getting lucky and landed a job at the same place he made $11/hour, but we got through it. 

When he was awarded Social Security Disablity in 2009

We're now living in the boonies (the country for all you city folk) and we're happy, but we have more bills now that we're more established. We're doing a little better, but he's still so depressed, isolated and miserable. He spends his days playing Call of Duty online. He says he's okay, but I know he isn't. I'm gone at work ALL the time and he's here with the cat. 

Through all this, but I do believe that illnesses like Schizophrenia are with you from birth, yet I also believe that certain factors in your early life can trigger the symptoms. For example, my husband suffered from horrific sexual abuse from two different family members and he started showing symptoms of Schizophrenia a few years later. He chased his poor mother through the house with a butcher knife at the age of eight. He cornered her and threatened her life at fourteen, but she didn't press charges. He claims that he barely remembers these instances. 

He had a lot of hate for his stepmother. This was mostly due to the fact that she was his father's mistress and she's the mother of his half-brother

He was always a lover of horror movies and that love still rings true today. He can quote you EVERY line from Psycho, I kid you not. He has an unhealthy obsession with serial killers. He's told me that, as a child, he looked up to them. He understood how they felt and wanted to become them when he was older. 

He is currently on 1000mg of Depakote and 250mg of Zoloft. This is his fifth medicine combination in three years. It seems to be working fairly well for him, and I slip up every now and then. One time, we couldn't afford his medication for 6 weeks. It was hell.

When he doesn't have his medication, his eyes remind me of a scared raccoon who knows he's about to be shot with a rifle. His expression is intense and terrifying. Simple conversations go out the window. To cope with it, he'll sleep. He's slept for 6 days straight before. He only got up to pee and drink water and would go straight back to sleep. He's no longer my husband.

Why am I typing all of this out? It's therapeutic for me, I call my Grandmother and let it all out. Other times I just take a hot shower and cry for what feels like hours. Why do I do this to myself, you may ask. Some days I just don't know. But to be honest, I do it out of love... because when he's on his meds like he should be, he's the fun and vibrant man I fell in love with. I'm terrified of our future. I'm so scared that his mind will turn into mush and I'll have to sign him over to a mental hospital. I've read up on other situations like mine and the outcome is usually pretty grim. Schizophrenics, as a whole, gradually get worse with time. Most are in hospitals at the later part of their lives and most are abandoned by their loved ones... either by choice or by suicide. At least this is what I've read.

What I *want* to read is hope. I want to hear that I'm not alone. I've been faithful to my husband all this time. I'm not ugly, reddit?

1374792629.0,1j25vi,"I, male, 26, just kinda ""broke up"" with my best friend/ long time love interest and I slowly realize how little of my early twenties I used to, you know,derlumpenhund,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1j25vi/i_male_26_just_kinda_broke_up_with_my_best_friend/

So, I had a talk with I would describe as my best (female) friend but love interest, and we kinda sorta broke up, or put our freindship on hiatus. How this came to be is a quite complex story but I'd like to walk you through it.

I've been a shy and slightly socially akward kid. I never really had trouble finding friends, observing and following end of the spectrum. People always have and continue to make me very nervous, and naturally I had an especially hard time getting to know girls. My first relationship happened when I was 18, and suffice it to say that low self-esteem, self doubt and anxiety turned this into a train wreck over the course of six months, after which she ended the relationship because I didn't have the balls to do so. After graduating from highschool I went through a weird phase where I gained a lot of unnecessary weight and had a bad overall look, so my non-extistent chances with the ladies and my social feedback didn't exactly increase my ego. By that time I already had a feeling that I might be depressed (thinking back I might have been so since I was around 16) and when I started to study at university I really was stuck in a rut. I did things but I was generally miserable. Around this time I met the girl in question and she was the polar opposite to me: She was confident, popular

Lacking the required, but it pretty much boils down to this) I naturally didn't just confidently walk up to her and have a talk, show some interest and see where things could go. I immeadiately put her on a pedastol and admired her from afar. As time went by, we started to hang out via mutual friends and after a while I got enough courage together to tell her I liked her. She softly rejected me and I kinda was OK with us just being friends for the time being. However, by that time I had really fallen for her and instead of getting better (physically, mentally, socially) for my own good and move on, for the off chance that if I got good enough she would accept me. We hung out more and more and ended up as best friends and pretty much shared everything together. Over time we had quite a few talks about how we felt for each other and the verdict was pretty much the same every time

I went abroad for a year and things started to get better. I felt like I was getting more confident in myself as a person and the distance and the lack of contact we had gave me some air to breathe. However, but I really felt the two of us had had enough time apart to have everything put in perspective, and maybe I was finally able to let my romantic aspiartions go and just enjoy the deep friendship and respect we had for each other. So for roughly one year all was well, she would tell me some stuff about guys and I wouldn't mind, but last weekend something happened that made me completely loose my marbles.

She visited me and was supposed to stay at my place and we went to party with a few friends and aquaintances. As it all happened, and I completely lost my shit.

We had a talk two days later where I told her that, at the two of them and at myself for still being this petty. We had a good and long talk and re-evaluated our freindship and what to do with it, and she said as the guy wasn't really pushing things in a specific direction anyways, they probably wouldn't end up together. So for 24 hrs I was reliefed and thought maybe I could continue on my path of becoming better for my own sake and accept her freindship for what it is. The following evening however, when she was supposed to stay with a mutual female freind of ours, she ended up sleeping at his place. And the following three nights until she left town again.

So this afternoon we had a talk and I wanted to know what was going on and if she remembered our talk from before. She told me she really liked this guy and I told her that I could not continue this way. I had analyzed our relationship before and tried to phrase things simple: I ffeel we probably never had a real freindship, who of course is naturally confident and sociable, can pull off in one evening what I had (sometimes unconciously) tried to pull off over the course of 5 friggin years. I told her I was not yet going to cut her out of my life completely, but that I would drastically cut down our contact and keep that option should things get to painful for me. I also told her, and I firmly believe that, that she has no fault, aside from choosing that guy. It wouldn't have been different with anyone else, and I was the wrong guy from the very beginning."" We ended the talk on sad but good terms
 
I feel weirdly betrayed, I already miss her and I feel like a junkie on withdrawal. I hate my brain and myself. And in the midst of all this I realize how little outside of this weird relationship I did over the past 5 years to actually and honestly meet other people. Full on quarter-life crisis, feeling too old to do the stuff young students do and just a general wave of sadness and depression washing over me.

Ive not been feeling great today, but I have no where to really call home.

I guess i should start with my parents, its not very well paid, but its a job, and its a good foot in the door for what could become a career. My parents are divorced and live seperately. They  *HATE* eachother, and throughout my childhood always tried to convince me and my brother the other was evil, this led to a lot of moving, a lot of not talking to one parent or the other, but my dad is by far the worst, unemployed, i said dont do that

My mum is a lot lot nicer, she puts you constnatly on edge, you cant do anything right in her eyes, and she makes everyday life incredibly stress full. Sorry thats enough about my parents. I hadnt seen my mum for about 2 years (or spoken to hr at all) until a few weeks ago when my dad went nuts on me. Im living at hers now, and she tolerates me. But its very vdery clear shes very upset with me, and dosent particularly like me. Wedont talk much, and i keep out of her way as much as possible. I understand that shes hurt by me not seeing her for so long, but I know this wont last more than a few weeks more. 

As you can tell im not at all close to either of my parents, but hes got his head screwed on. Hes normally pretty intelligent, and a nice person. But hes extremely confused by what happened when my dad attacked me, and my dad has managed to manipulate him to think i attacked my dad, and im the bad one. Despite the fact that I decided NOT to press charges on my dad, so he doesnt spend his final months in prsion (forgot to mention he has stage 3 cancer in his bladder, lungs and liver, but im not too bothered by this). But if id made a statement
 So basically my brother thinks im a horrible person and is totally blanking me

So at the moment im living out of plastic bags in a bare room in my mums house

There is one more really big thing thats upset me for the last few months, just finished high school. We fell completely in love. I travelled over 200 miles by train to see her every week, then when she moved i travaled even further, and kept our relationship togethor. She was my first, and last girlfriend, the first time id had sex, my first kiss, she was my everything, and started acquiing a few male friends. And seeing them more than me. I saw it coming but it still landed like a punch in the face

The first is a little graphic, and I reach down and give her a hug. The second was this time we had a shower togethor, we where bored, and kinda cold. And decided to jump in the shwoer togethor. I can picture it so vividly, her standing infront of me, and her brown hairs all wet. it really kinda shines, and looks nice. I give her a kiss kiss on her head, she jsut looks at me and her expression perfectly captures how we both feel

So thats about it i think for my story. Im just feeling really, and unwelcome where im living at the moment. But i have no where else to go.

Sadly most of my money for the last 2 years went on train tickets to see my ex, and doing the rest of it in a few years, working full time for a few months, then renting a tiny flat or something. I worked it out and I can *just* afford it, if i save for a few months. What id really love more than anything is another cat, and my own tiny shitty flat. My human skills are pretty fucked up after all thats happened, and i deffintiely get on best with animals. So id love kroe than anyhting another cat to cuddle, and i want to love something in return.

1335191456.0,so6ub,Hey MMFB. How do I get over her?,getoverher,22,4,11,"I'll save you the long version... But here is the short version.

She broke up with me about a month and a half ago after a two and a half year relationship. I was completely in love with her and didn't expect it at all.

As to be expected

We were still getting on until about a week ago. I was at her house to pick up my passport and have a quick catch up when she asked me to set something up on her laptop, and with a different title. At the bottom she told him she loved him. I felt like my heart had stopped. Especially because I know how much writing a someone a letter means to her. She only does it with the people that mean the most to her.

I know who the guy is and I always worried about him and her

It has literally been a month and a half and she is already telling this guy she loves him. It either means she is confused and rebounding or (more likely) she had a thing with him while we were still officially together.

What is even worse is she told me she broke up with me because she couldn't trust the way I acted around other girls. I was friendly with other girls

Now I have no one

I feel like my life is grinding to a halt. I am still in love with her

I'm so scared that if I don't get my shit together I'm only going to plunge in to a deeper state of depression. I have a history of depression as does my family. My brother went through a similar situation at my age involving a girl and he went to an incredibly dark place.

I've been with this one girl I am madly and deeply in love with
She really pulled me out of a massive slump in my life, and so much more than that.

Recently she moved far away from me for a greater education

We agreed to try a long distance relationship, who liked her. She never told me most of this to keep me feeling secure, as I am usually quite insecure and such.

Anyway, from this one guy.. They had apparently met and watched movies before together, just the two of them, no intimate conversations, and it seems like purely friends.. I didn't want to ask about it to not seem like I invaded her privacy in anyway.

I finally bought it up
Come out two year ""anniversary"" (just been together for 2 years, I find out a few days later that she has been getting intimate with this guy ever since we broke up (and they even attempted to do the deed), all since we had broken up.

Knowing I don't want to lose her, she has him set in her heart.. After an amazing weekend, she's in tears and can't decide between the two of us. But tells me she needs someone there with her and I can't be that person.. Since then I've come home and being home is worse than ever. I hate being away from her, and my life is not worth living anymore. I can't find any reasons to be happy, and this city I live in is the biggest shithole filled with idiots and dropouts.

She says she still loves me, but being friends only makes me miss her more, I've done everything I possibly can to get her to reconsider, but she won't even give me a chance and it hurts more and more by the day. I also am losing her more and more by the day.

Also, and I can't get her off my mind.. I want her back, and giving up on her isn't much of an option as she is close to the only human interaction I have in my life, even though she is 10000 miles away.",,False,,False,t3_rfo8m

I was bullied by the entire school from 7th-10th grade for not fighting, but I never got the chance to meet the other afflicted kids. Instead of concentrating on my studies, I had to prepare for what would happen the next day, each day. Whenever I studied instead, I paid dearly for it. I was slapped with baby lotion, insulted by my teachers, had my desk flipped with me in it, I was simply trying to take a piss, like I said, but they apparently thought it was ethical). 

Reporting them to the staff didn't help, and put grades in the system. This was a school that was located in a town that valued sports, fighting, etc rather than academics or anything truly worthwhile. They once interrupted an important exam during school hours for a girls' football game that everyone was required to attend. This wasn't a mostly black school either, it was highly diverse. It wasn't in the ghetto or a rural area either, it's just that the people there were just...evil. My parents' responses at first indicated strongly that they didn't believe me when I explained the situation, but one day they decided to tour the school and found out I was right. They flipped shit and pulled me out immediately. 

When I left the school and the area it was in, and that such an outlandish statement would never have become a general consensus. After moving to where I am now, people are respectful, kind, and basically normal. When I was simply able to walk down the hallway to class without anyone giving me shit, trying to trip me, or anything else, anger, etc. I don't really know how to put it behind me,

1372700562.0,1hfsjz,Everything I've ever cared about has been taken from me. I can't see a future.,lost__cause,24,7,7,"This is a long story and starts a while ago. On a throwaway account because I wouldn't want anyone involved to find or recognise this.

About 16 years ago I was going through a tricky time romantically and personally. I was coming to terms with the fact I had spent my childhood emotionally abused and bullied by my father after my mother left to go explore her lesbian side or whatever and my 'first true love' (god how I hate that term but it's how it felt at the time) had just gone off to uni and predictably things had fallen apart. Looking back I was gripped by a deep depression

Enter G. Now G was 29 years old and worked with me. She was divorced and I later discovered already had a child from her previous marriage. She was also very, umm, quick to share that 'experience' with me, if you catch my drift.

It was the perfect storm - I was young, confident and not shy to tell me what to do, how to behave, what to wear, etc. I fell infatuated with her almost immediately. My lack of experience with life and relationships meant I didn't recognise the abuse for what it was until years later - until the physical stuff started.

Now, and everyone assumes that means I must be dominant/ 'not afraid of a little woman'. But I was - I spent most of my twenties with this woman and lived with daily terror.

She systematically separated me from all friends

And when I use the term 'not allowed' I don't mean I'd get the silent treatment for a bit or a nasty note on the fridge. I mean I'd have various things thrown at me

Then we had our first child. Quite simply the most amazing day of my life. Our daughter was and remains the most incredible thing to ever happen in my life. For the first time I felt I meant something more than myself. G didn't even bond with her at first so I was doubly lucky in being able to do everything from the night-time feeds to bathing her and everything in between (work schedule be damned).

It also, but she could make me do anything by casually neglecting our baby if I didn't do what she said the moment she said it, she'd wait until I was at work and then call with the baby crying in the background and make some comment about how she '*would* feed her but she was too tired at the moment because I didn't do X or Y for her when she asked earlier'. 

I won't list all the ways she did this but with our first

Finally, but high stress) and be constantly bullied and abused at home topped off with discovering from a friend that G had been having multiple affairs for years through a second facebook account caused me to crack and I suffered a full-on nervous breakdown.

Whilst hospitalised I was referred to counselling for the first time in my life and I must say it single-handedly saved my life I think. The counsellor helped me to see the twisted knot of crap I was calling a relationship wasn't 'healthy and normal' but instead very 'unhealthy and abusive'.

It took me about six months

Now, but because I remembered how much my family splitting up hurt when no one paid us (the kids) any mind, so I wanted my children to know at least ONE parent was willing to dedicate their time to THEIR wellbeing.

Now fast forward to last year. My mother (who left to go be gay) had finally made contact with me after more than 15 years. not the traditional way

Turns out her partner (female) had been abusing her for the last 15 years. Well

So whilst I was trying to rebuild a very low income life for me and my children (G only saw them alternate weekends and occasionally during the week so she could claim child tax credit and child benefit without having to actually give up time she could be screwing other guys I assume) I was also trying to extricate my mother from a deeply abusive relationship so I didn't wind up getting a call one day saying her next suicide attempt had been successful.

There's a lot that went on during this period but the important thing is that ultimately, she would feel more secure. So, given she had the spare rooms and her partner was restricted from coming near any of us by court order I did that.

Unfortunately this is where the wheels start coming off. One of the things my mother had hidden from me was that she had developed alcoholism during her ordeal. Now

Finally the trial came around and we waited with baited breath for a custodial sentence - sure 15 years of sexual

I think for me this was the proverbial straw. I'd put my whole life on hold

I'll admit

Only that didn't work out - because I'd moved to my mother's my old surgery had silently deregistered me

On top of all this, had been reporting to social services every single time my mother told them I was feeling down with 'concerns over my mental health' without telling her.

Now we come to February - I knew the house had to be sold so was looking for somewhere for me and the kids to move (truth be told I was looking forward to not having to be a parent to my own parent as well as my children) and suddenly my mum tells me the contracts are being exchanged in a fortnight. Turns out she'd privately sold the house and not told me 'to protect me'. Of course it had the exact opposite effect, pay the deposit and move me and the kids in.

Literally whilst I am reeling from this I get a knock at the door and it's the social workers.

Now I had never had a problem with social workers - in fact I'd asked them to check on my ex once before when the children had told me she'd reverted to her neglectful ways on the days they were there after her moving out. However these social workers were different.

For a start they wouldn't tell me why they'd come. In fact on three different occasions they told me three different reasons. None of those reasons turned out to be honest.

Next they were asking some strange questions about domestic abuse

In essence I sleepwalked into a trap set by my ex-wife and her new rich boyfriend.

Now I don't really want to go into all the grisly details but it transpired G wanted to move ~150 miles away to live with her new boyfriend and give up work. The only way she could do this was to accuse ME of being the domestic abuser

Long story short they took my children away from me based upon the word of a serial adulturer

On top of this

Since then, to them, MUST be the abuser in a relationship. In their reports for the court they have repeatedly completely omitted any of the many positive things reported to them by people actually involved in my life, all of whom were very open and forthcoming about how good I was at being a single father, and have presented G's lies as 'the most likely scenario'.

Within a month of my being put in this position she then moved her and the children 150 miles away

So my poor children, liar and neglectful mother. I'm crying just thinking about how confused they must be about the whole thing.

Meanwhile I am forced to live in a hostel, finding someone who wants to share a house with a 33 year old father of two is a fucking BREEZE (not).

I'm slowly having to sell all my possessions as I run out of places to store them. Literally everything I ever had and cared about has been taken

I can't seem to wrap my mind around it

I only cope at the moment by putting it all out of my mind as much as possible. But then I see something that reminds me of my kids and it's like I pulled a plaster off an open wound. I mean I literally crumple like so much waste paper and can barely hold my own body up with the weight of the injustice my kids are going to have to call their life.

I just don't know what to do.

Sorry for the long post, and I don't want to burden my friends with all of this in case they get tired of my shit and stop calling me or taking my calls, I figured reddit was my final option.

1363656342.0,1akbqh,I reported my co-worker to our Sergeant for inappropriate behavior.,throwdownimminent,17,0,3,"I started a law enforcement related job a few months ago where I work in a small team of 3-4 technicians.

I'm not sure where to begin. Two of the techs used to date. They had a messy relationship and a messy break-up. Being a young woman and the fact that the female half of this doomed duo has severe jealousy, the officers we work with and admin workers kept saying they were afraid for me. I shrugged this off, as she (let's call her Mindy) was great to me in the beginning. Very helpful and nice. The male half (let's call him Bruce) was also very professional and nice at first.

Allow me to recap a brief timeline:

Bruce invites me out to happy hour with friends and wants to keep it hush hush at work. I honor the request as I like to keep up boundaries between work and personal life up, hits on me, gropes me, and tries to hook up with me. I tell him no by any means, that I only wanted to be friends and most certainly only wanted to have a strictly professional relationship from then on. Awkward, but I let it go because a) he kept it outside of work and b) he was a bit sadly drunk and pathetic about it, so I felt bad for him.

Flash forward and I slowly become friendly with Mindy

Our lead technician leaves for another position. After which

I start to take on more and more cases. At first, usually ones they'd rather not do.

So under this atmosphere, they both separately tell our supervisors that I will take the case. I do the case, pissed off but I take it, and then after getting back into work I ask them for a word.

I say, but that I would appreciate being asked first. That's all. (Note that we are all in the same position - equals - this is important)

Mindy blows up. She raises her voice at me and yells, she states that it was easy overtime and that I was getting paid for it. Bruce walks out of the room. I attempt to disengage because she is yelling and obviously does not want to be reasoned with. She keeps yelling, stating that we take turns with casework and that we're all equals (my thoughts: then me taking 4/5 cases in 2 days is ""taking turns""? On top of two projects and the work the lead tech was responsible for before he left?). I state that we don't have to fight about it, that I only asked to be asked. She yells that we're not fighting (oh boy) and that I'm pissed because I didn't want to do the unpleasant work. I admit that I was pissed, but that it wasn't about the nature of the work. She tells me that I'm lying and ""Admit it. Admit it. You came in here pissed. Let's talk about this like adults."" (Note that I am half her age, so now that it is hours later I do wonder if this was said as a power move due to my age) I say ok, let's talk. She rolls her eyes, yells that the system in place is to take turns and I need experience. I tell her that I understand her point of view

Flash forward, Mindy has a history of putting work on and bullying anyone female from work that hangs out with Bruce. She doesn't know about Bruce hitting on me, but she knows that we were both at the St. Patrick's Day work happy hour. Apparently, she's been written up several times for physically and verbally threatening other female co-workers. I was urged to report the yelling.

And so here we are. I reported it

Tl;dr the lessons learned: Confront co-workers with a supervisor present. I may have been trying to handle it on my own without getting anyone into trouble

My ex girlfriend of almost four years broke up with me almost three weeks ago. For the past few months we had serious convictions of tying the knot her later years in college. I set up a savings account for the ring and the wedding. I figured that with us getting married and wanting to have kids I was going to need a stable source of income. I was looking at some culinary schools and striving to become a chef and fulfill a old childhood dream. I was beginning to set course for our future together. 
      The day she broke up with me
 Just to give some context, and we first met our freshman year. I had broken up with her before during high school because I actually had serious considerations to join the priesthood or becoming a monk. Ironically, it was actually my time off during spring break my senior year that I spent on a retreat in a monastery that actually lead to the end of my faith. 
       Fast forwarding to the present, ethics, and subjects of related natures. Needless to say that my pursuit of these schools of thought has only furthered my skepticism of any flavor of religious faith. While, I am not a fan of the term, I am an atheist. I told this to my girlfriend who a few months ago joined what would seem like a Christian fundamentalist sorority, as expected she was not delighted to hear this. Months went on and every now and then we would discuss this invidious gulf between us in terms of beliefs, that never ended well. Eventually it lead to her breaking up with me. If I'm at fault
     But anyways, I completely planned my life around us being together. I feel lost at sea, my compass has been shattered and  the stability of my mental health has taken quite a shift. I'm beginning to build myself up again slowly but it's painful and my mind is limping by.

While this is a process that I'm still trying to figure out, etc. While there is no one right answer and advice is just that, advice. I feel like sharing in some experiences and exchanging words with you guys will help me along my path.

My father and I immediately took a road trip to Tucson, AZ where they used to live. Now here I am in Tucson and my ex decided to start tormenting me and we've been fighting for the past 3 days about how I actually found out she was cheating on me. Truth is, it was one of her friends trying to protect me from her, but she was nice about it and showed me physical proof (pics and whatnot) and I don't want to throw her under the bus.

(my friend's name) hey!
&gt;
I was looking through my old emails and then saw that I never replied back to your emails. I'm so sorry :'( 
&gt;
Ok so this is going to be a very long venting session. Like the one we had in French class all the time. oh 6th grade. I haven't taken French ever since so I've never actually had the chance to vent since then haha.
&gt;
So anyway I miss you and everyone at (my school name) soso much. I have friends in Japan of course but they never quite live up to you guys. As in, and a few more too if you're that sort of person who's easy to dislike. no offense or anything, because most of them are all really nice. they're just...empty and willing to mindlessly believe the ideals (indie, hipster, ""depression,"" awkward moments, one direction...the list could go on) that society forces upon them. ugh i guess i sound so full of myself right now and i hope you don't think i think i'm perfectly thoughtful and have mastered the complications of life. because i haven't. i'm just as imperfect a person as i could ever think of, and if they have, every aspect of life is built on those conventions and to abandon them would be impossible.
&gt;
anyway. phew. that was a lot. if only i could write that fast when writing essays. minus the many runon sentences i probably made. this isn't my typical school writing. i hope you followed my train of thought
&gt;
have you read the perks of being a wallflower? if you haven't you really should. it's probably one of the best books i've ever read and consists of a series of letters that a character named charlie sends to a stranger as a way of self-reflection. you're not a stranger but i'm sort of aiming for that with this email - pure, but you have no obligation to say what they would like to hear because you're never in actual contact with them. as in, they can't exactly influence your physical life. there's only the fact of their existence and the assurance that they have read your letters. no fake emotions or coverups. i hope that made sense. i don't exactly know how to describe it. but it represents an opportunity for candid self-judgement of the human i am at the moment, which i'm in desperate need of right now. 
&gt;
i'm sorry this email seems to be taking forever. i swear i'll be done soon. all i need from you is that you read my words
&gt;
anyway the reason i started to write this letter in the first place is that i'm working on my boarding school essays now. well, a semi-autobiography, what i want to see in society, etc - i noticed that i don't have a very strong sense of self. the character is definitely there and i have firm values. i just don't know how to define them into intelligible terms for my brain or the admission officers to understand. which is very strange, but i think i know why. i don't mean to bring up the subject and it's high time i've moved on, but basically every aspect of my life now comes down to that decisive month of february 2010, and i'm afraid this one does too. do you remember what happened then? i don't. i've trained myself to be in firm denial of the events that may have happened and my heart has repeatedly refused my brain's right to even acknowledge the events. over time i've managed to build a virtual barrier around that line of events within my thoughts, but for about 9 months now i've been in absolute rebuttal. anyway
&gt;
but lately that's becoming a difficulty. it really is. i guess this is part of growing up: the urge to become more sure of oneself. to stop pretending and know what makes me who i am. and this boarding school essay totally presents that opportunity to come in terms with who i really am, i'll unleash the monster that i was in the past.
&gt;
but even when contained
&gt;
so basically the monster defines me. and the monster defines my character. and i cannot finish these boarding school application essays without finding my character
&gt;
i guess it's sort of amusing that considering those circumstances, that's better than facing the reality of my frame of mind.
&gt;
except for this time. i cannot pretend to be someone else in the boarding school essays. my conscience won't allow me. but the thing is, it's my fault. 
&gt;
meanwhile i'm actually having a pretty good life which i feel horrible about because i can think of so many people who deserve it a lot more than i do. i won an award for my app which was released on the app store in october and have 18000 downlaods. and that's japan alone. i've been featured on various media for that because it;s unusual for a girl/woman to be interested in technology in japan let alone an 8th grader. yay? i got a new camera for my birthday have an iphone 5 and got a macbook pro retina. i have nice friends with amazing outfits (ha, it's a start. again, all i need is the reassurance that a good person is reading this email. i can't really explain. 
&gt;
please read the perks of being the wallflower if you haven't. it moved me and i swear it will move you too. i trust that it will move you. because you're a human albeit a good one. and then you'll get a pretty good understanding of where my thoughts are coming from and maybe you will reread this email after youre done with it and have some sort of sympathy that may have been inexistent before. in case you don't have the time
&gt;
i would like to say that this would be the last venting email i would write to you but i can't promise anything. 
&gt;

Over the course of these years, rather pitifully, and all through this, my poor mother and older brother had no idea why I was acting out so much.

When I was fifteen, not my mother, not my brother, no fucking single person believed me. I lived in foster care for a few months with a wonderful family, but then I got sent to another home which was very abusive. She was intensely religious and hated me. She yelled at me constantly and said that I was fat, lazy, all of it. She said I was evil for liking Harry goddamned Potter. 

I got sent back to live with my mother

By this time I was sixteen. My mother and I went to live with my grandmother, and when I was almost seventeen, my mom pulled me off the roof when I was trying to jump off. I went to the hospital for psychiatric care (for the fucking fourth time,) and got sort of better. 

Now I'm alright, and my life is okay. But. I'm just so sad. The relationships I have with my family are so tainted. My family doesn't want to believe me, because it hurts. I don't know if I can ever fully forgive them. I just need someone to make me feel better.

When I was injured I did not receive any compensation or help with my medical bills

 I am not supposed to lift anything over 25 pounds but my neurologist knows that my son is 40lbs and I will never give up holding my child but I have to take special precautions when I am carrying him like a back brace and have him stand on a chair for me to pick him up. He is only three years old and I cannot just ignore his want for his daddy to hold him. My Neurologist just advised me to do this only occasionally and it will be okay. 

I returned to college after my injury and finished my AA degree in social work and I am applying to start my BS degree in Criminal Forensics.

Currently I am Unemployed but I apply for 20+ jobs a day because i cannot just not work

My neurosurgeon cried when he saw my MRI scans because I will never be the same. He offered to do the Spinal Fusion but after further talking to him that with spinal fusion you have to go back every 5 to 10 years and get the vertebrae above and below the fusion fused and eventually I would have my entire spine fused and I would be extremely restricted and possibly in a wheelchair. So we decided to not do the fusion

I have been through allot and never asked for anything in return I just need advice as to how to make my life easier. I am in constant pain because of my injury and I know that narcotics will stop that but after being in the medical field I also know how highly addictive they are. I occasionally take a Oxycodone maybe once a week but I avoid them as much as possible. Because when I am on Oxycodone although I do not feel the pain I have a hard time stopping myself from going and doing hard work outside at my farm. Then i just wake up crying and screaming because I overworked myself and it ends up making my situation worse.

So currently when i take a narcotic i have my wife stay with me the entire time as to make sure i do not do any heavy lifting or bending at all because I have the Drive to be active and I long to just go do physical work like before i was injured.

I spent Six months in a wheelchair

I have had Five MRI's, Two lumbar punctures, and three months of physical therapy. 

I am 22 years old and that is my story.

Well here is the story.....

It all started at the field that me and my brother and my youth group play ultimate frisbee at. We had asked someone to grab some drinks from the quickstop near the field. The person who was getting the drinks drove up and the person with the frisbee held it and kept walking with it, ""Jesse, you better drop that frisbee, or I'll tackle you"" ( my name is Jesse) Now my brother normally just jokes about things like that, so jokingly back I just chucked the frisbee somewhere randomly in the field and walked over to get my Gatorade. And the my brother told me to pick it up, I just thought that I was going to get my drink and then get the frisbee. My brother got louder so I decided to get the disk first before he got mad, then someone else started to walking over to get the disk, and then someone grabs my hair and the back of my neck. It was my brother, I will smash you"" I just say ""I didn't run at you or even think of trying to hurt you

I used to work for a bank, I asked for assistance via my friends, got it. Found a job at a restaurant, I made just barely enough money to live, I had a roommate for a while. Everything was going well until they left to move back in with their parents. Leaving me to make rent and utilities on my own. I had been asking for more cash assistance from my friends, and they helped me. (even though I hate asking for financial help.) Then, I got a hit with my new job, that I would get 30-40 hours a week

Now, if that. I'm so angry that I left my other job, I couldn't get it back even if I begged. I've desperately have been looking for other jobs but to no avail for whatever reason. I just feel like I keep trying and trying and trying but nothing ever helps. I have tapped out even my parents for cash and they will not let me come live with them. The only financial assistance that I have found was the 30 bucks I made while busking over the weekend (I do living statue work, but the town I live in is very tiny.) the maybe 100 bucks I will get from my job next week, and my forever amazing, lovely, wonderful boyfriend who got a bonus this week at his job and can swing 200 bucks my way.

My stories starts about 5 years ago at bible camp, especially with the 12, 13 &amp; 14 year olds, who were approaching high school. This included Facebook adds, invitations to hang out with friends, etc. Pretty much, campers who imprinted on councillors, and get help and guidence when needed. 

I met him when I was 12. I'll call him Marmite. (It was his camp name; he wasn't there for many sessions, or imprinted on him, but I did have him on Facebook. 

A couple years later Marmite enthusiastically messages me, and a week later it stopped.

Jump again to the end of January, and played on our hockey team. As per usual, we were kicking ass, so Marmite decides he's going to come down and watch. Shortly before he leaves, he messages me, asking if I want to come too. I tell him sure, I'll come over after exam review for science. (The arena is a cross the street from my high school's science labs.) 

We watch hockey, and before I know it, we're leaning into each other, and kissing. One thing leads to another, and suddenly we're on the outskirts of town making out, and sheding our warm clothes, grinding, exploring, and he's driving away. 

From there my downward spiral into hell commences. I've had self esteem and cutting issues for years, and he begins awkwardly trying to sext me over Facebook. This stops when he makes up with his girlfriend. Now rinse and repeat... for 6 months. Everytime brought a new wave of depression and scars.

Mid-March: After an emotional breakdown

Mid-April: A couple friends who are aware of at least SOME of the situation take me to the guidence office and book an appointment with me. The next day I'm set up with a councillor. 

June 9

At this point you're probably thinking ""Why didn't this chick or his girlfriend just drop him out of their lives?"". Have you ever seen Jar of Hearts by Christina Perri? That's how Marmite was. He sucked us in

Skip to July 9, telling him to stop, he's ignoring me and telling me he loves me. I tell him to slow down, he pressures me into trying. I try, and am in excrusiating pain. Instead of stopping like he promised, he begins going faster, rougher and harder, only to have him force me into it again. Again, and insisting

July 10, and bouts of puking. 

July 11, I believe I may have miscarried a very early pregnancy. Marmite neglected to use a condom, and a fair amount of his attack was down there. (Pre-cum?) 

July 13

Mid-August: I see him and his girlfriend at the arena

Early January: One of my best friends and I finally patch up our relationship after the drama with Marmite almost destroys our friendship. Since then he's helped me properly heal

Early April: He stalks me briefly at a public event

June 22

June 23

This past week I was on vacation

Now: I've made it 13 months without cutting

Today is the anniversary though. What am I supposed to do? I can't walk alone or take the bus without worrying that I'll see him. I live my life in fear, I do attend church, but Marmite has caused a huge crisis in faith, and I'm starting to fall away from religion.) I hate that I can't feel safe here in my bed because I know he knows where I live. I've destroyed his actual ex-girlfriend's life, wrecked my own, and can't get out of this death spiral.

I grew up and got over it and now Im a 19 yo college student living on her own, adjusting to single partying lifestyle.

I also can't imagine anybody ever loving me again, terribly broken.

The crux of the issue is that I turned 20 about two weeks ago and now I can't sleep anymore because I'm terrified of my own mortality. Ever hear the song *Ol' Man River*? With the line ""I'm tired of livin' and 'fraid of dyin'""? Well, and what happens next.

The way I'm seeing things is that I'm now roughly 30% of the way through my life. That knowledge terrifies me to no end. Every night for the past week (and off and on for at least the past month) this is the first thought that pops into my head whenever I try to go to sleep. I can't help it, and if I'm lucky I'm able to go back to sleep.

I think part of this problem also goes back to when I turned 10. My grandfather off-handedly made a comment about how I wasn't a single-digit kid anymore. This thought has remained with me ever since. I've also had a very strong fear of death since then. I remember crying in the tub because I caught my reflection too many times and thought of how I wouldn't be this young again.

Now I'm sitting here, but can someone at the very least tell me that there's nothing to be afraid of.

I hope I didn't take up too much of your time.

I met my ex-gf (hereby known as Felicity) about 2.5 years ago. Things went exceptionally well and I knew I had found the right person for me. Almost from the first conversation we had, and for no reason other than that. Very quickly into our relationship, she let me know that she had a daughter. And I was fine with that, despite the fact that I was some loser of a man who didn't have what it took to take care of a family at that time.

After only two months, and I felt as they struck me with their hands, or any weapon they could find. One of the earliest memories I have of my life is of me feeling suicidal and crying.

Saying I love you to Felicity was the first time I have ever felt that way about anyone. I knew I was on to something. About 6 months later

Because my ex was afraid that I might leave her and her daughter when I got bored or whatever, and one video, Her daughter and I started off our relationship by playing video games. 

First, it made her laugh and scream from terror; it made us get close. I helped her kill zombies, and she helped me kill zombies. She'd have me kill all of the witches because those were the scariest monsters in the game. Every time I failed to properly kill a witch, she'd laugh at me. And she'd heal me as soon as I got up. She'd heal me whenever I got any damage on me at all. That was her favorite thing; healing.

After Left 4 Dead 2, too. Right by the flower stand. I'd act like I stole a bunch of flowers and she'd chase me all throughout Dalaran.

Shortly after that, and a feeling of everlasting neglect that I felt at the time. None of that was warranted. It was all me. After one really big fight, we stopped talking and because of that, I stopped talking to her daughter, too. That fight was on the 22nd of May 2012, and the last time I talked to her daughter was on the 21st of May.

A few weeks later, the same fucking problems all over again. We stopped talking around the end of December and I began a long journey to getting better. I began to fight every single thing that I suffered in my childhood. All of the depression, the neglect, the abandonment, I fought all of that and once I *knew* I was a better person, I contacted my ex again in late February of 2013.

And things were going so well. Not a single argument. I wasn't a prick any more. I was the idea person to date

I looked forward to hanging out with her daughter again. I was doing so well that I knew it would not be long before I could talk to her again.

This last weekend

And there you go. That's the end of that. Maybe it was destiny, I could have gotten at least another year with her if I hadn't been such a fucking idiot. Fighting over the most senseless things I could think of at the time. Not realizing that everything I've ever wanted was right there in front of me already. We had talked about getting married and having kids together.

""I am a person who always puts on a façade. No single person on earth would suspect that the way I act around my friends is literally just an act. I just keep my emotions where they are – on the inside. Like, for the entire sixteen years of my life, no one other than me has ever seen, which holds my true personality. In my opinion emotions were not made for sharing. They’re made for *trading*. But there was one person who, for the first time in my entire life, made me think otherwise. I was *this* close to showing *her* that second layer. But I screwed it up. All of it.
I was greedy. I had finally experienced the taste of accomplishment. But that was not enough. No, it’s easy to let things go. *Forget*. I mean – *It’s better to have love then lost than to never have loved at all,* right? Well, not if that love is as one-sided as a conversation with a *fucking* wall.
I guess I was just caught up in the moment. Watching too many movies does that to you, like some video game. No, I had to live with my decisions. With my mistakes. Well fuck that.
The thing is, courageous, outgoing. I started working out, changed my personality (albeit not so much externally as internally), and started getting closer to her. The process was slow, and at the end of the each day I could look back at my progress and say, “Yeah, “This isn’t a very healthy lifestyle” and just straight up do something about it. Now
Eventually, and I just got flat out rejected. *Twice*. Something must’ve been wrong in my head for me to even fathom asking her out, let alone actually doing it. Not to mention the fact that I did it twice...
I made a fool of myself. *She* just wanted to be friends. *I* didn’t. It was never going to work out. That much is obvious. But not to me.
I guess all I can do at this point is forget the burdens of the past. Don’t worry about the future – it comes soon enough. Live in the present. *Forgive and forget.* **Everything.**""

Just something I wrote last night while I was depressed from being rejected by my crush.

Here's some more background info if you're interested (it's a long and unnecessary read
When I was twelve I used to talk to this girl online, I got into playing video games after-school, which were a major time sink with no real benefit, and ended up rethinking who I am, and how I've been acting all my life. This resulted in me becoming a very anti social person - normally only communicating with people who talk to me first (mind you, this does not mean I didnt try to act like a better person around others). When I got into high school, I kinda relied on my cousin to help me merge in with the groups there. I got into a group who played similar video games, I couldn't help but stare at the girls who passed by, I get to sit next to this hot girl in Physics' to the two of us joking around, I was working my way towards her: I started working out

I've had several stressors piling up this week

So there's a blood drive here on campus. They come every once in a while; I try to donate once a year since coming to college. First and third years, Dad!), but I got the job done. Felt damn proud about it, too, insofar that I choose to donate when I know what it'll do to me for a while. Second year, they wouldn't let me since I was still recovering from a cold, but they gave me a shirt anyway. I remember asking them not to give it to me

That brings us to today, but today, I planned around that shit. Ate a pretty hefty breakfast, powered through some truly awful grapes (I never knew it was possible to fuck up grapes, but there you go), cost myself a trip home before heading back to campus.

I was a little nervous going in, actually. They cleared me for donating, I got ready; everything was set.

I can never recall how long it takes to donate blood, having my essence drained out of me, and I just keep thinking to myself, ""holy crap, I'm saving lives."" After what seems like forever, they finally take the needle out of my arm. That wasn't so bad; I'm not even lightheaded!

They inform me that I wasn't hydrated enough, blah. Not wholly unexpected; I'm kinda terrible about that, I guess. I ask if they can at least use what I've donated. They say no, that the anticoagulant they use is set for a particular amount of blood that exceeds that which I can provide for them. Essentially, I just spent about an hour waiting, testing, and bleeding out for nothing. All that heroic motivation? Shaggy dog story. I haven't saved anyone today.

I'm not sure why I'm beating myself up about this, so that should count for something. But that doesn't really matter, seems like. People waiting for transfusions don't benefit from the blood the doctors are throwing away as I type. I feel so fucking useless right now. The bandage on my arm is a lie, and I'm ready to take it off so no one else has to ask me if I've donated. Again, I really have no idea where my attitude is coming from. This usually isn't me. I don't give this any thought when the blood drives aren't around. But for whatever reason, it's messing me up now. Just...fuuuck.",,,,

I couldn't even get out of bed. I literally hid underneath the covers like some kind of child. I use to be so strong. I use to know my worth. One of the worst things is after I posted the last time I had a great day. I stood up for what I was worth. I had the ability to actually show my boyfriend how much I love him. I was able to actually let myself love. But then I slipped again. I am falling back into the dark hole that is my life. It doesn't matter what anyone says. No matter what anyone says it is like some kind of lose lose for them. I get hurt by every little thing. It is like I am so afraid of being hurt that I put myself through hurt and pain all the time so when it happens I just expect it. I just know it is coming. I am just so messed up... So very messed up... So broken. I literally feel broken. Like I would starve if it weren't for the fact that my boyfriend forces me to eat. He does so much for me. Goes to school... Work... Cleans... Takes care of me and our two dogs... and here's me... Unable to do anything besides go into work where I continue to barely function. I work in customer service.... I have a terrible fear of people. When people come up behind me I jump and squeal like they were going to attack me. It scares people. I know it does... But I cannot help it. It just happens.

I have now just kind of thrown myself into reading. Reading... and tv shows. I talk to no one. I just work, and watch tv. That is my life. I am lucky if I shower daily. I cannot understand how my boyfriend could even be attracted to such a mess of a person and I always feel like he would be so much better without being stuck with me. I literally tear him apart...

Honestly, and turn our living room into a fucking dance club at 3 in the morning.

Needless to say

A few months ago

I found out yesterday that she tried to hang herself and is now comatose. It doesn't look good. Part of me takes morbid satisfaction in knowing that this stupid bitch who made a fool of me and showed so little regard for my emotional well-being is finally getting hers. The more rational and compassionate part of me is absolutely disgusted with myself and sees nothing but a senseless waste. I wonder if her contacting me was some attempt at reconciliation and that in my blind hatred I missed an opportunity to finally have some good come out of experience together by helping her not harm herself.

I have never been more emotionally conflicted in my life.

A week ago I was attacked on the job, but verbal.  I read the attacker the riot act: ""You ever do that again, I'll break your arm or put your eyes out.  You have no idea who you're dealing with.  You attack me from behind like that, I go berserk.  Anyone would.  What do you expect?  Sorry, but I don't have any control over my reactions when you grab me near my genitals and pin me to the ground—so watch out.  You've been warned.""

During this whole speech

My boss's boss showed up right then and told ME: ""Stop it!  Enough is enough.""  

I couldn't believe it.  He was disciplining ME

I went straight to HR and told them the entire story.  I was on the edge of tears the whole time.

Anyway, so I gave two weeks' notice Monday morning the minute my shift began.

Now, but especially when I'm at the job.  I have four days left.  I am terrified my boss's boss will take me into his office, shut the door, and start screaming at me (which he has done many times in the past).  The dude is very intimidating.  He grew up in a family of boxers.  

I've made arrangements with HR such that I don't have to be left alone with him, got the highest raises, and the highest bonuses.

So how do I get through these last four days starting tomorrow?  I'm terrified.  I couldn't even get out of bed this morning; I had a panic attack when I woke up

Please help if you have any good ideas.  I have a good friend who's been my therapist for weeks (he's seen it all in our line of work)

..but don't believe it

I know this feeling worthless thing all too well. Unfortunately many people do. It's the reason why some people find it hard to get up some mornings. It's crucial to one's self esteem to understand that feeling worthless is a lie.

Before we can work on this feeling let's take a look at some reasons why many of us feel this way.
The Media
We are bombarded with images from the minute we wake till the minute we fall asleep. And sometimes we dream about those images

We are told who we should be, movies, magazines and newspaper ads.

Don't get me wrong I love watching some shows. They provide a good escape when you need it. But I often times get knocked back to reality

Fitness is huge in terms of self esteem, you are left to feel like you are not good enough.

Anorexia is very real to men as it is to women

We see what we are supposed to look like everywhere. It's hard to combat such relentless imagery. Our body image is affected by these images more than we know.
Our Economy
Another biggie is career and money. It seems if you are not making 50 million dollars a year you are not successful. Our world's current economy is based on money

Money unfortunately is the cause of all the poverty in the world. I have my own views on our current economy

""Money isn't everything

In our society
How We Deal With These Feelings
To combat these horrible images that we are confronted with everyday

Take commercial images for example

Feeling worthless because you want to be like the fake contrived airbrushed images is not worth your time and energy. We are who we are. Remember you are beautiful. These companies just want you to feel bad about yourself so you buy their crap that you don't even need. Love yourself!! :)
Be with people that accept you for who you are. Getting positive reinforcement from real people that you actually like can be very powerful.

I am such a big supporter of having positive people in your life. It makes such a difference. Imagine how hard it would be to try to be positive and love yourself with people all around you being negative.

Please get rid of negative influences in your your life. They can really amplify you feeling worthless.

Block out the nonsense from the outside and get in touch with who you really are. You are a star

Met a girl when I was 16. Lets call her B. We started dating, we were best friends. We spoke about how we never wanted to lose each other, and how much we loved each other. She helped me through an eating disorder that was a really dark part of my life. She was my rock. Every important memory in my adult life so far was spent with her. Driver's license, prom, graduation. I decided to cut off my plans of entering the military just so I could go to college with her and make this relationship last, because we were seriously happy and I was sure there was no way I'd ever lose her.

We got through our whole first year without any struggles, she tells me (through a text message) that she needs time. 

I decided I'd give her the time she deserves, and she gave me hope that we could get back together. Tonight she just told me that she thinks we should just be friends. She said I was such an important part of her life and she doesn't want to permanently cut contact. 

I feel so betrayed, and I feel so alone. I'm having a hard time imagining myself on that college campus without her, and I just don't see myself doing anything alone.

At first I tried to stay optimistic, and by the time September came around, I was having a much harder time keeping any form of positive thought about finding any work that ""validated"" the last 4 years of my life and tens of thousands of dollars. Thankfully, for reasons I won't go into student loans aren't an issue, so for better or worse I didn't having any debt to start worrying about right out of school. 

The winter months saw a lot of promise that ultimately went nowhere. Lots of interviews with no callbacks

Since the start of spring, but it felt like a waste of time and money, as it seemed more suited towards older individuals having a mid life crisis, and the counselors running it seemed unwilling to provide me and useful advice or guidance on what I might be doing wrong.

And meanwhile many of my friends around me have had their lives move forward. A month after graduation I was one of the groomsmen in a friend's wedding, and started questioning whether or not I have been a good friend to anyone. Most of my closest friends have work, not all in the fields they went to school for but clearly a better situation than me. Meanwhile, I can't help but feel like my life is frozen in place by things not entirely in my control.

While I should at least be thankful my parents have been supportive and still willing to tolerate all of this, we don't get the chance to hang out much if at all. Finding the will to get out of bed is often a struggle on days when I have no social commitments to worry about. As time goes on it becomes harder and harder to find joy in much of anything.

Despite all of this I at least keep trying to find work, but finding a job probably isn't going to make everything better.

I kind of put off responding for a bit. I wanted to think about it... she's a really good friend and I didn't want to hurt her, and even ignoring that, I just... don't think she's the right sort of person for me, and I kind of have a crush on someone else I've been too nervous to tell... no matter how I look at it, it wouldn't work out. Especially because of the last reason... the past few days I kept thinking about him instead of thinking about how I'd try to tell her. If I accepted her on the off-chance I was wrong about myself, I know I'd just make things worse.

She started talking to me today, and started crying, and... I don't want anyone to be hurt by me... I feel terrible that I can't return her feelings and I just want to forget it all happened. I know I shouldn't feel this way, but I just can't stop crying. Can someone... anyone, just tell me it's not all my fault and make me feel at least a little bit better...?

1346491284.0,z6fxm,"Found out my Fiance may be cheating, being deceitful at the very least. I just don't know what to do. It's just all too much. ",quequelchose,19,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/z6fxm/found_out_my_fiance_may_be_cheating_being/, especially when we were supposed to just be having a nice dinner together

For a long time I resented Reddit only for the reason that it was taking him away from me. I would half joke sometimes that he loves reddit more than me and there were times when he didn't even correct me even though I am sure the look on my face was of utter disappointment but then again how could he see it with his eyes on the screen? 

The behavior of not being able to leave his phone alone never really went away and I started noticing that it was getting worse. Before if I asked what he was looking at on reddit

Another incidence where I noticed this was when we were just sitting down on the couch watching TV and he asked for a shoulder rub (while looking at his phone). I got behind the couch and once I did, possibly cheating. 

After a bit of fun time one night, so I figured I should know this girl. It was also a Saturday at 8 or 9 at night so it felt a bit inappropriate for a coworker or boss since he works a M-F,8-5 job. I asked who she was and he said 'a friend'. To which I replied 'Oh, from work?' Nope. It was a friend from reddit. He quickly and awkwardly got out of bed to ignore the call and turn the phone face down. 

It starts to eat at me and bug me. The woman calling

I start to think that if he isn't cheating then why the behavior? Why the secretive phone screen? What could be on reddit that he wouldn't want me to see? So I join reddit in secret. I remember him telling me that he likes to post his poetry up in reddit and see the comments that he gets. So I begin my search. Some submissions on reddit I see and decide that perhaps I could just make an account so I can comment and also check on what he may be doing. He never told me the username he submitted his poetry under

I found out that he did post his poems as stated and there were comments there dating back for about three months. What I didn't expect to find was a thread in which he is playing on sexual innuendo while commenting on another user's reply. Who is it but the woman who had been calling him since her name matched his phone followed by a year. So I am also guessing it is not a throwaway account for her. She invites him to PM in the thread so there isn't any more for me to see there.

After finding this, and the fact that he gives good shoulder rubs. It did say in the title that it M4R-platonic chats and I am relieved the only comment was from a guy. As I keep looking through the history, I notice there isn't just one of these, but several. Some of the dates started to seem a bit familiar.

I matched the dates to text messages in my phone. I also tried to remember what I had been doing a week before. Come to find out he said he needed to get home (we are not cohabiting

I start to see a correlation between when he says he needs to do laundry or he's 'tired' and posts about wanting to go out and do things like go to the museums or see a movie. Had he just been honest and said he needed space or wanted to hang with friends it wouldn't have hurt so much. I had a male friend read his R4R posts and he did mentioned it sounded like he was looking. My friend also said that he thought the posts were inappropriate considering my fiance is going to be my husband one day. He also thought it was strange that there was no mention of me or the fact he was taken.

I'm apparently so insignificant my fiance poses as a single man. What a self-esteem booster.

Yesterday was the last post my emotions could really handle. I had called him after he was out of work and already at his place to tell him about my day. He talked to me for about five minutes before saying he wasn't feeling very well and would have to call me back a while later. Something just didn't feel right so I went to check reddit to see if he had posted anything. 

Apparently he had made plans with three other people over R4R to do something over the long weekend and they had things come up. So I read a post about how he was disappointed and that he was up for going out for drinks if anyone else was interested. This was five or six minutes at least after I hung up with him. I had to check the time because I couldn't believe I had just been lied to again. 

Telling him that I wanted to start a reddit account was my plan to see what would happen to all his posts once he found out. I told him I was going to start an account

I already had a few of his posts and his username profile page up as tabs on firefox

Already having been on reddit for only 4 days, items from his overview are beginning to disappear. Threads and comments are also saying that they have been posted by '[deleted]'. This is a red flag for me. Fortunately I copy pasted all the incriminating posts he had made before they came up as deleted. Also, I recopied the posts after the had been posted by '[deleted]' and making note of when I refreshed and found it as such. If he tries to mention it as coincidence, It really is just too much of a coincidence that it happened in less than an hour of me informing him of my intent to join reddit. 

After getting all my information together for a confrontation, how I wanted the help of someone older and wiser like a parent. I just cried even more.

My whole family never really warmed to him. My mother an aunt hate him, we can talk about anything and even if we haven't spoken in a while it's like nothing ever changed. The first thing she did after I told her ___ may be cheating on me was cry. She knows about how much I had to stand up for my fiance among my family. She said that it was F'd up that he could just take all that for granted. I don't know if it helps to understand the family dynamic better but I am first generation Asian American and my fiance is Caucasian. There is a lot of pressure to say the least since I am also the first born and first grandchild on that side of the family. To keep it somewhat simple since that is a bit of another story for another day, my family gave me the toughest of times because I was with him. But I suffered through it, all the back talk and gossip among the family, being left out of family gatherings, because I love him. 

I also know that if I were to go to my mother and tell her it was over

I tend to word-vomit when I am worked up so I thought it would be best to wait to confront my fiance about it. I want to be in a clear state of mind when I do what I need to do whatever that may be. 

I don't even know if I have enough evidence to really prove anything. I feel like I've caught him but I can't be sure. Either I can't be sure or my mind doesn't want to believe what my gut and heart are telling me. I don't even know how to confront him about it. Advice on that would really be helpful. Also if you think I have gained enough to even confront him.

**TL;DR: My fiance is being deceptive

Update: We did talk the whole long weekend and a majority of the answers I thought to expect were answers I did get. Does it excuse the lies though? No. Am I still hurt? Of course. It perhaps is naive, not to be confused with trust. I have re-read a few of my MFT textbooks and although the breach in trust in relationships can be helped through therapy, outlooks for the long term are not very high. I have been clear with him about regaining trust. I am not sure it can be entirely regained. If it can't then the answer is simple: it just won't work, the damage is irreparable. If it can, it isn't going to be overnight it could take a very long time. There may be days where the level of trust may take a few steps back from progress because of doubts placed there by lack of trust.There may be days where he is able to show me I may be able to trust him again. I'm no fortuneteller and I don't make guarantees. The comments and support here did help give me enough strength and confidence that I wasn't in the wrong, my feelings were justified, and I was deserving of answers/explanation for his actions and behavior. He has made intentions to regain trust clear but again it will take time if it can be regained at all. Especially considering he would have to work up to a level of trust I previously held for him,,1346829181.0,t3_z6fxm

I'm a 20-year-old electrical engineering student from a 3rd world country.

I recently admitted to myself that I'm gay. It will probably affect my life very much. I don't fit in the gay culture at all. I hate gay culture and after visiting gay chatrooms and dating websites

I look awful. I have scoliosis, my face is asymmetrical. Above all that I also have arrythmia. 

The worst thing is knowing that I have brought most of this upon myself by being physically inactive

I come from a family of refugees. My mom and dad don't have real jobs. Mom works at a local market selling stuff, grandma's pension and welfare. But grandma died 2 months ago, so now our financial situation is even worse. I miss my grandma, she was the best person I ever knew. Now she is gone, too.

I started college a year ago. I'm not doing well at all. I passed some easy exams and the ones that really interested me, and some exams will definitely have to be transferred to the next year. I'm lazy as shit. I'm addicted to reddit, and it takes so much of my time. I browse for hours without even realizing it. I waste so much time on it, but I feel like I have no willpower to stop. I don't have the willpower to do anything. I needed 3 days to finally make myself write this. There's so much stuff to study, and every day I struggle for hours to even start studying. I totally feel like a failure. I don't have a strong motivation anymore and it fucking sucks. And the distractions are everywhere. I hate myself for this.

Months went by, and everyone else's expectations.

I have no real friends. The ones that I do have are good persons, I hate clubs, so socializing is pretty hard. I thought college would be different, but people there are still pretty much the same like everyone else. I just don't like the mainstream culture. Overemphasizing drinking, sex and shallow things just infurates me. Everything is getting dumbed down. Everything is retarded. I feel like I should have been born in some other era.

Here's the rundown, I've done a lot of extra curriculars and do some volunteer work as well. This all changed throughout the last year of university for me (the Winter Session of 2011-2012), as my family had come through somewhat of a crisis, having my father trying to support three international students in Canada - two of which attend univeristy, while the youngest one is nearing the end of highschool.

Needless to say my family became really strapped for cash

Now this is the first time I've been put in any situation like this

In hindsight I've been trying to look at this through a positive lens, since it was a field I find myself leaning towards.

Anyone have any suggestions they can shed? Would be greatly appreciated.

TLDR;

* I need only six credits to graduate from a top-tier Canadian university.

* My last year my family had financial problems and I decided to pitch in

This doesn't happen often

I am not talking about anything sexual here. That does not matter. No. I... I just want to be with them so much. Them... as in two little girls I know. One seven and one eight. Both beautiful. Both amazing. All three of us have a great relationship. Last week they came to my house. We had so much fun together. I yearn to be with them. They love my company and I love theirs. We respect each other as equals. They know I don't treat them any lesser than I would anyone else. I love them so much. I want to be able to share this. I want to tell people. I want to shout it from a mountain top. For obvious reasons... I cannot.

Now... imagine you are in love with someone. It is no different. Besides the ages. It really isn't. Luckily for me I am not an exclusive paedophile

You know when you are in love? All the love songs hit home

Any doubters.... you can twist it in your head all you want. All I really want to do is make them happy. I want to see them smile, when they sneak me quick kisses and then blush. When I am there they need to be with me. They whisper in my ears ""I love you.""

First of all, I'm 21 years old. It began as a teenager (around 14 or so) and grew slowly to a real depression, that lasts since approximately 3 years. Don't get me wrong, it was never so serious that I wasn't able to go to school or work, but It drags me down. I feel like, that I were able to get better grades, if there wasn't the depression and the social anxiety. The same applies to my work.

I don't know, I felt like there is no one that understands me and my feelings... until February or March last year.
A buddy had a new girlfriend and we got along. One day she called and asked me why her boyfriend was so upset. We talked more than an hour about my friend (her boyfriend), that I was missing her as a friend. As I realized I was torn apart between ""cheating"" my friend and have someone to talk to. After quiet a short time, I saw her on the bus and we talked.
I was having a girlfriend at this time, she noticed, that I was sad and depressed and we hung out several times talked about our lives, and our feelings (She had mental issues too, and still has in my opinion, but this is a different story.)

In the beginning of November last year, because I'm emotionally cold. I was deeply hurt and didn't text her anymore. If I'm sad, I get apathetic, and it's really hard to get rid of that apathy and I think this high level of my apathy and lack of emotion scared her.

I didn't saw or talked to her since last Saturday and it was kind of like she never was scared of me. I was a bit depressed, that it won't work out, this was not really uplifting...
I met Lisa after my date, some chatting and hanging out. Later she texted me, that her boyfriend showed up unplanned and said sorry. I was mad, but understood her.

Today I texted her

&gt;Lisa: My boyfriend doesn't want that I'm spending time with you. You are a negative influence sry

&gt;Me: What?! Why?!

&gt;Lisa: I'm will block you. bye

About me:
All my life I have grown up a quiet and shy child. Always watching people and observing their emotions and actions. I feel like I was born with this girft of observance and understanding which has allowed me to help people with their problems and point out why someone may act a certain way, aaaand I also like technology. I cried at the age of 6 when Bambi's mother got shot, I cried in 9th grade when my dog died and even led to me skipping school, I take words more personally than I guess the ""average male"" would, and I've had a lot of girls say I would be the perfect boyfriend because I always understand how their emotions (the ""gift/curse"" i was talking about).  My first PC was 6 years old. Windows 1995. My brother bought it and raised me around technology, which is what I went to college for. Took every computer class and aced them. I love computers and video games. Ive played hours of NES, Sega Genesis, Gamecube, and PC games from 2004 on including any game from Valve, but it hasn't stopped them from doing all they can as my parents

My Family:
My mother and I were very close. My father was too busy trying to fix cars to sell them, my mother was diagnosed with 2 leaky heart valves and some form of thyroid problem that I can't remember off the top of my head.  But the 2 heart valves gave her troubles when she was subbing at my school and almost died. She lived, thankfully, but the problem left its mark on our family.  Because of the accelerated heart rate my mother has from these leaky valves, emotions that lead to increased heart rate could put her in the hospital. For the past 7 years I have been living with a hormonal time bomb and as I aged and hormones took over my body, we began to grow apart. She saw me as her youngest and does not want me to leave to marry another girl like my brother did. Essentially, my brother has great respect for my mother and how he raised her. My sister in law does not and made sure that my mother had no hand in their wedding and she also tries the best she can to keep her children away from my mother.  Granted

1.)I am naturally shy and feint/lock up when a pretty girl talks to me
2.)I DO NOT want to have to deal with my mother who watches over me and judges all my friends
3.)I don't want to make that kind of commitment until I feel I am man enough to support my spouse through her pain as well as my own.
(When it comes to people

Frankly, started to fall for them, and get friend zoned as they use my advice to get with the guy they like. I feel used by girls and it makes me pretty bitter.  Enough about my personal life. Crap went down today.

The Problem:
The past few years, and I am lazy. Every day I have about 20 chores to complete as well as ""drop everything and run"" when mother needs a glass of water or whatever it is she requests while browsing the internet on MY laptop.  Eventually I got fed up with her saying ""wash the dishes, fix the computer, dust the house, pick up the grass (from 10 acres of mowed lawn), weedwack the grass, help your dad with the cars... because Im too busy on the internet"" after I got home from an 8 hour work day at $10/hr.  For me, I'm more than willing to expound.

Today:
Last night I had a dream that a girl i knew actually cared about me. It was a pleasant dream where it seemed like everything I ever wanted was working out right.  The nightmare was waking up. I realized it was the 3rd time I had a dream like this and I began to hate my life. I was pissed and in a bad attitude. My mother (in bed) asks me to check the internet for her. I chose not to cause i was getting ready for work. She gets up after realizing i didnt check the internet and asks ""why are you running late?"" which i wasnt. My response ""Im sorry time continues to move forward when I get ready for work."" (i was tired of continually telling her that im not running late) She continues on and asks ""did you look up my stuff on my websites?"" i respond with no, she asks why its taking so long, i respond with ""Im sorry I cant reverse time and wake myself up when YOU think it appropriate. then i could take care of myself AND do the stuff you want me to."" She got pissed, but i was pissed first.  She then starts scolding me about how i should have a routine down for these chores, a verbal fight ensues, i defend myself with reasons for what I do, my mother's heart rate escalades, my father yells ""what are you fighting about NOW?!?"" and mom says ""Its just &lt;my.name.here&gt; being &lt;my.name.here&gt;."" When she said that i stormed out. She has classified ME into a negative behavior. MY persona and name has become a title of negative viewing in her eyes.  Two weeks ago she was ready to kick me out. After a 6 hour fight between my mother, you dont like it
In the end
There is SOO much more I could get into but I just don't have the time. Im about to leave work and head home where my mother will probably greet me with a smile and be fine for the rest of the night...

I started dating a girl almost a year ago. I was a senior in college, where I live. But all in all we have had one of the least bumpy relationships you can imagine having. We've had so much fun over that time span.

I graduated back in May. When I left, as the fates would have it, three months later I was offered a full-time position back at the University, just before the new fall term started. The job offers full benefits and full graduate tuition remission, which was fantastic because I desired to pursue my MBA degree. And, above all, I got to spend virtually all my time at the University my girlfriend attends. It seemed like a win all around.

The past two months, I was there to see HER, but we always spent all our time around her friends. I just feel so out of it around them. They would all talk about clubs that they were all in and events happening on campus that, as a full-time grad student, have nothing to do with me. My girlfriend would go **hours** without even paying attention to me.

The other day, which I understand. But she also said that her and I are living different lives and that ""she wants to hang out with me around other people,"" because that's the way college works. That really put me off and hurt a bit, but I ignored that to her and repeated my apologies over and over.

It's been two days since then and she's barely talked to me. We usually text each other all the time, and then she'll text me back two hours later changing the subject again. 

We've been in each other's lives less and less. This morning has been nothing but random bouts of crying in my office

The other day when we talked she told me she still loved me

I wish beyond wishing I could do something about it

And one meal sometimes ment one sandwich, or one bowl of soup. That was it. I remember there came a point when the electricity was cut off, and during the day
He stored his playboy magazines on the bottom shelf of a bookshelf. One day he caught me looking at them.  I remember this night vividly. He was sitting in his chair across the room, and either she didn’t want to believe what she saw, or she was too drunk/stoned to care, in any event, she did nothing to stop him. I was only 9 years old at the time, and I didn’t understand what was happening. It continued like that for a while, and eventually he would come into my bed at night. ( I had to sleep in the living room because the only two rooms with heat was their bedroom and the living room. My brother slept on the lazy boy chair, he started coming to my bed at night, because the only way to heat the water was on the stove. This all went on until my behavior at school started to become so extreme (always in fights, and kicked out of my second school at the end of third grade.) that my teachers started to ask my parents questions about my home life. One day

When it came time for legal action, in order to convict him, they needed my testimony. I was 11 at the time. Scrawny. Terrified. I remember in great detail the chair in which I was sitting when the DA was asking me to tell her what he had done. I remember they handed me a doll, and asked me to show them. I cried. I threw the damn thing across the room. I curled up in a ball under her desk. 

He walked out of the court room a free man.
Fast foreward several years. Fresh out of high school, and I was smart enough to know that I did not want to fall into the student loan trap) so the only option I saw was the army. So like the person I am, I just dove into that head first, without a clue what I was getting into. All in all that worked out well enough, right up until shortly before my 21st birthday. How she got my number I will never know, but she called. 10 years, and I don’t hear a thing from her

A couple of years later I learned that she was still living with him. He is still alive. He still has a grip on her.

1310800109.0,ir4uz,Girl I Like Started Dating Another Guy,Creebe,19,4,4,"I'm kind of drunk at the moment. Please pardon my grammar errors.

I've known her for almost 6 years. She was the kind of girl I was okay to cry in front of. So yes I was friendzoned before I even liked her. It all began last summer. She was away for a month and we hadn't seen each other at all. She asked me to meet her on the first day of school and I agreed. It wasn't really a school day because my university always had an orientation day for the first years. 

*Autumn fell.* I met her and she gave me a hug. It was soft in the beginning but she tightened her arms as we hugged. It was different than all the hugs I have received. So we talked for a while and I decided to go home. There was a lot more opportunities to meet up after school began. I left school feeling warm and cozy. School soon started and we saw each other from time to time.

She was busy from her housing duties and I simply was taking 7 courses at the time. But we still found time to meet and hang out one on one. 

*Winter fell.* It snowed on a particular November Saturday and I was around school area where she lived. So I texted her and we met again. She was running a bit late so I was standing in the snow waiting for her to come. The mean time I contemplated about the fact that if I actually liked her. Yes I enjoyed her company and she was everything a guy like me can dream of. And my heart had its reason my mind knew nothing of. 

She soon showed up and we began to walk across campus to sit down for breakfast. On the way she told me I was ""so funny"" and all. I thought that was good and kept pumping jokes and charm.

It ended well and we hugged good bye in the afternoon. It was already sunny. My friend called and a lot of us went up to the mountain to watch the sunset. They asked what I was doing earlier but I was reluctant to provide information. I was still wondering about her and where this can go.

I had a peaceful Christmas

I was grateful that I had a close friend like her and also terrified of the feelings I had been developing for her. I was terrified. Some mornings I'd wake up an hour early and wonder about her until the sun came up. There were weeks when I could barely focus on my studies because she was on my mind always.

It soon got too out of control so I text her and called her and visited her even more. It might have been selfish but I couldn't help it. She gave me strength to fight through my heavy course load and worldly problems. To my surprise she agreed to see me almost every time I asked her. I was scared.

So scared.

*Spring fell.* It was finals season again. Classes were done. So I studied with her every day. She had her problems too. One time

I waited downstairs

I was scared. She's a friend of mine

I waited.

Our friendship got to the point where we would share anything with each other. It was the kind of friendship I had never had before. But I liked her and it was consuming me slowly and softly like the flame to the candle. I thought that I loved her and I would do anything to keep her out of harm. My God was I crazy for her.

I guess I still am. Maybe that's why I'm drunk..

*Summer fell.* She went on a trip to the east coast to see her extended families. I couldn't wait anymore. I decided to ask her out and settle the deal when she comes back. I waited and waited. Her return date got delayed and it missed my birthday by a few days. I was slightly upset but I was still cool.

Finally she came back and I wished her welcome back as soon as she landed. That was Monday.

Then I finally summoned my courage to ask her out today

It's the real world now. My mind is clear as the glacial waters. This dawn is brighter and more brilliant than ever. This is me. A young male adult who didn't seem to be bothered by almost anything - devastated. 

Earlier today

So here am I. A disappointed idealist trying to get by. I don't feel sorry for myself. No

It was a long night. I sat at my firehouse on call. We get hit out for a motor vehicle accident with confirmed entrapment. I run to my gear rack, and sprinted for the door of the first response truck.

As I buckle my seat belt
I was brave enough at the time to come out and I told her that I was bisexual. Ironically
We did everything together

I sit in the seat of the first responding truck and wonder ""what poor soul ended up in this accident?"" but I did what I usually did.
The first responder filled up and off we went. We arrive on scene to a car embedded into a tree. I didn't really think much of it

I run around to the back of the truck and grab the hydraulic pump and the large cutters. Another guy grabs hoses and a generator light and we rush to the car. I'm about 10 feet away as I start up the pump

Nothing in my entire life could prepare me for what I was about to see.

I looked through the window, but being that the person in the driver seat was my own girlfriend and my best friend, I fought back, and continued to  cut apart the car to get her out.

I stand there for about several hours with a 40 pound hydraulic rescue tool in my hands, and begin to secure her to it. When she got secured to the board, we ran to the ambulance that was on scene. I jumped in the back and prep her for transport. The EMT's tried to push me out of the rig, but I said to them ""she's not going anywhere until I'm on this rig"". They didn't want to argue, so they got ready to drive what was probably the longest half hour of my entire life.

I am in my 20s, from South America, he's in his 50s, from USA. We met about 2 years ago in a cam website, since then we developed a great friendship, and then I fell in love with him. It was great on the beginning because it seemed like he had a crush on me (and he admitted later that he, in fact, we would send e-mails, etc. It was just like a regular relationship, I wanted to date him. He said and made me believe maybe we would meet someday even though he didn't think he would ever fall in love with me

Back to a year and half ago I started to found out he was telling me lies, every single day for the past year we've had an argument. We would get angry, yell, get sad, cry, and then make up again, on a daily basis.

I asked him to stop broadcasting in this website, and then I started to find out more and more lies. The jealousy and demanding started to grow, I asked him to stop talking to the people he met on these websites, and he said he would and made an Skype account with only me on it, for about 6 months I believed that was true but later I found out he was still talking to them, but using Yahoo instead of Skype.

I would ask him questions that he would say it wasn't my business, etc. Sometimes it were just regular questions like ""how was your day? what did you do today?"", and he would get upset, not wanting to answer me.

I told him I fell in love with him and that's when things went from bad to worse. He said he knew and that explained the demanding and jealousy

He could be very cold, maybe I don't"". It was just very cold and hurtful.

The first time I said ""I love you"", but I felt he didn't mean it.

Recently things got really, I found out many lies. He was so hypocritical, he would tell me a lie, and shamelessly expect me to believe it, and he get angry at me for not believing it. He wanted me to believe a lie, and he would yell at me and argue with me if I didn't.

On his e-mail I found out all sorts of things, Skype, Facebook... I found out many many things that made me get so furious, so angry, so disappointed that I did another horrible mistake. I threatened to put some private pictures and conversations on the internet for all his friends and family to see, of course I would never do that to him because I loved him so much, but I was just so angry that these words came out of my mouth without me thinking of what I was saying. For the past two weeks I broke into his e-mail about 4 times. On his e-mail I also talked to two people pretending to be him, and probably did more things recently but never told me). He kept hitting on my friend asking him to ""drop his pants down"" and to do stuff with him next week when he gets back from his travel

I also talked to another guy, this guy from Singapore fell in love with him too, and the same thing happened, jealousy, arguments, etc... Same thing happened with another guy from Poland... Now tell me, all this things in common, make us fall in love with him just to stroke his ego

Anyway, annoyed, and so did I. He ended up telling his friends and brother the issue he was having with me. I guess that this is what made him say goodbye.

Everything seemed to be getting better though, hang up now if that's what you want, I'll go and break into your e-mail again"", but I DID NOT DO IT, I hung up and went to sleep.

The very next day he messaged me saying he had deleted his e-mail and that he lost years of jobs, his Flickr page, etc etc. I text him but he didn't answer me, he also didn't answer the phone, and he had deleted his e-mail so I had no way to get in touch with him. So I went to his personal (business) website, and as I knew the password I logged into it and added a message on the main screen asking him to contact me because I knew sooner than later he would see that, and that's the only way I could have him know that I wanted to talk to him. But that was the straw that broke the camel's back.

He texted me saying to fix his website and stop doing this and ""give his life back"", I didn't mean to make us get to this point. He said he didn't want me to contact him ever again, and that if I did he would do something, he was the one threatening me now. Today he talked to me on Skype, I could not stop sobbing, he was cold, he was angry, I kept asking him to give me a chance to fix this but he said ""no"", my friend asked him not to, he will try

I just can't live like this, not as a lover, but he doesn't want me to try, he said I can't do that, but I think I can, but now it's too late, he said goodbye, I want to try, he made a new e-mail. He asked me not to look up him on the internet, but I don't think I can.

I just don't know what to do. I want and need to regain his friendship

**Sorry for the long text, depressed. I want his friendship back. He was one of the most important persons in my life, I don't have many friends, I'm depressed, anxious, maybe bipolar, closeted to family and the few ""friends"" I have, he helped in many way

Awhile ago

Then a higher up in the company came down with a hatchet and I was one of the people to go. Months earlier I had been in a Facebook thread that ended up being critical of the company and that outweighed years of working there

To make matters worse the company happily threw me under the bus by saying I was dismissed with cause for ""violating contract terms"" so I was denied unemployment insurance despite working solidly at only two jobs for a decade. Because the first company no longer exists and I don't dare put that last place on there my resume now has virtually no references on it.

Since then I've been forced to live off of savings

So now I have no choice. I've put in applications and it looks like I'll be rejoining the hairnet and apron brigade, is fairly high where I live.)

I'm actually pretty confident that my mom (who is now a bipolar wreck who I haven't spoken to in almost 4 years and who is not allowed to see my children) was deliberately overdosing me on two of my medications when I was a kid
I had a whole litany of problems all through grade school that are easily attributed to overdoses of two meds I was on at the time. 

Pharmacy back then was way more relaxed about pill counts

Kind of a mindfuck. I mean

I still have memory and concentration problems from all the seizures I had from age 9 until around age 14. I was planning to go to med school and then my academics just took a dive around the same time as the seizures started.

Now I work a very mediocre IT job (decent pay

I guess there's no punchline. Meh.

I may regret not using a throwaway for these posts

I spoke to my dad and brother about it

I spent my entire childhood feeling fragile and getting bullied to the point of physical injury nearly every day that I was actually at school. I felt inferior and vulnerable for my entire life until my mid twenties, on the paternal side, hyper-critical of both my father and me and my brother (but never my cousin)). It took me until 24 or 25 to realize that I could actually do productive, constructive things without fucking them up. Something as basic as writing a story that someone else would enjoy reading. 

And then to have this realization about a decade into my ""self-repair""

What's particularly galling about this is that if my mom really did this deliberately, and had plenty of trouble already. I had to deal with the debilitating effects of the disease and then on top of all of it had to deal with what, I suspect, she was doing to me on purpose when the doctor's visits weren't frequent enough for her. 

I was on an asthma medication with very dramatic effects at toxic levels that would have played into such a disorder nicely, basically, poisons. It's possible the overdoses were accidental but it seems very unlikely given the frequency. What I can't understand is how my pediatrician was so incompetent (but then, I used him for my own daughters for a few years and it's not so fantastic.)

For various reasons, but also my hyper-critical father, grandparents, aunts, and uncles, systematically ruined my life and made me into a miserable and terrible person that I'm ashamed I ever was. 

This realization is just the latest (and probably greatest) insult. 

Nearly every morning when I was in grade school, which felt like setting my hands on fire. Then I'd go to school where I'd wrap my bloody hands in toilet paper and attend class. You might imagine that this was a source of bullying, and general alienation from my teachers, who in the mid 80s felt like it was not only none of their business, but no doubt extremely awkward. 

My prospects at any kind of social life were ruined by these sort of ""disfiguring"", nevermind my mom's interference in every friendship, school activity, etc, to the point that no school mate nor their parents wanted anything to do with me lest they have to also deal with her. (Not to mention how she groomed me to be absolutely paranoid and trust no one and assume that everyone had sinister, ulterior motives.) 

I really thought I could just die at any moment. If I got the slightest bit out of breath or dizzy, with hard leather restraints now reserved for psychotic drug addicts, that the nurses refused to remove for hours for fear I'd injure myself in another fit. 

What REALLY pisses me off is that I've spent the last 10 years (I'm 35 now) first recognizing all of the personality flaws and insecurities and bad traits I was harboring, MUCH more empathetic (instead of just selectively empathetic), and a much better person, in my own estimation, all around. And now I feel like I've been clothes-lined. The last few days I'm irritable, snapping at my kids, pissed off, not even knowing WHAT to think of my fucked up mother...

My cognitive abilities were permanently damaged by those seizures. Sure, I not only have to keep copious notes, but a gantt chart of my plotting, post-it notes all over the place, all sorts of memory aids because as soon as I stand up for a bit and go outside, or have some lunch, or grab a drink, really do believe was intentional malfeasance by my mother

I created a throwaway just to post this

This last Friday, then me. It took a few hours but they stopped my fiance when he came home from work and hauled him off after questioning him. 

I asked my sister what had happened, a little saliva might help the itching if she wants to try that. After a bit she asks him if he'll please look for her and he immediately says no, not a good idea. After a bit of her whining he hesitantly agrees, looks, and puts a little saliva where its red. According to her, he was immensely apologetic and afraid of hurting her, but she insists (and I've asked her multiple times to make sure her stories match) that he did not hurt, hysterical over thinking he had hurt her. My sister has seemed calm this whole time

Let me clarify...there is no way, this was all an incredibly stupid decision. The school counselor apparently overheard her telling her friend at school and this is where it all started. I am not one of those women who would cling to an abuser for any reason and my Dad and I both agree, one of us would have put him in the hospital if it had turned out to be malicious. 

I don't know how to feel...I can see how it can happen innocently enough. I volunteer with abused and neglected children and I see all sorts of sexual inferences from the honest mistake to full on rape and this

I just don't know what to do...I've talked to him twice now, worrying about hurting my sister and he once asked if I could forgive him which I gave a tentative yes to...

I'm just...I'm lost right now, aimed at me when I was younger, but this just floors me. If he had hurt her, I'd wash my hands of him and say good riddance but...I think, I hope at least, I am being as rational about this as possible. 

We're not wealthy at all

Please, if that helps. I'm too many emotions at once to describe, I don't know if I'm being rational or if I'm just in shock...Any advice is greatly appreciated.

1360726054.0,18f7x2,Fired on Monday morning,praline43,14,0,12,"Forewarning:  This is a going to be way too long and jumping all over the place.  Writing to get it out. I just want to write out the events that happened over the last couple of days.  I appreciate any insight anyone can give.

I worked for a medium size company.  Probably 150 full time employees.  Definitely had a ""mom and pop"" feel to it.  Whatever the owners wanted

I was fired Monday morning after two years at the company.  I received a call on my way in to work from my boss, and joked with him that our boss shouldn't make ominous ""meet in HR"" requests first thing on Monday morning.  I jokingly said I hope I'm not fired, to which my co-worker replied that there is no way that would happen.

I go up to HR and enter the room.  My boss and an HR rep are there.  The HR rep says ""We are terminating your employment for failure to meet job expectations.""  At this point I really thought I was being pranked by my boss

I get the security escort out.  First a stop by my office, little things that won't be missed, but in the shock of it all I didn't even know what to do.  My winter coat was in another part of the building, so I'm escorted over there and pass some part timers.  I say hello, trying not to make eye contact.  I pass a full timer who I worked very closely with.  He jokes about the blizzard.  I fake a laugh, and awkwardly shake his hand (totally out of place for 10am on a Monday morning) and say see you later.

On my way out to my car I see one of my closest friends and tell him what happened.  He can't believe it.

I go home

I go to lunch, so please let me know if you know anyone.""  From what my co-workers told me, he seemed sick about having to make the announcement.

So we have a lunch where everyone is angry and ""how can a company do this"" and ""the owners don't know what its like to ruin someone's life like this"" (not my words

I start to process why.  We had been talking since late December (our work is very seasonal, even led a meeting with some company big-wigs about the ideas on the Tuesday before.  In my time here, if I had any criticism about my performance, I immediately rectified it, and had heard only positive things since October-ish.  Not that I heard anything major negative about my performance before October, it is just the last incident I can recall where anyone had an issue.

I had a company cell phone and no personal one (this is a mistake I realize now), because I do want to know why, and she says she can't give it to me.  That's fair...that's what HR does.  I'm a little put off because I can't phone or email my part timers and let them know I appreciate them, or even use other contacts to see about getting another job in the field in the area...so I am a little angry about that.

I do email my boss and say:
Hi &lt;boss&gt;

I completely understand if you don't want to
minutes to chat?  I don't currently have a phone but I can call using
google if you give me your phone number.  No worries either way.

If I don't hear from you
the past couple of seasons.  I really appreciate everything I've
learned from you

All the best.

After a couple hours I get this response:
Thank you for your note.
Any correspondance should be addressed with &lt;rep&gt; in Human Resources.

Let me re-iterate

Which really hurt my feelings at first.  Now that I've had a couple days to process he's probably just covering his ass on the company email address.  But I have to admit it did sting.

I wanted to ask him (and I did ask a couple other people I work with) if I'm not cut out for this business.  I've been doing it for ten and a half years, I was fired.  Everyone else I work with thinks I should remain in this field, so I'm still pursing.

I sent a quick message, to my closest co-workers.  Saying that a job is a job and I'm sure I'll find another one, but I'll never get the opportunity to work with such a great bunch of people.  Gave my new phone number, personal email, and to keep in touch.  Since I sent that I've received a couple heartfelt messages that really made me cry.

So far I've filled out unemployment and made an appointment to meet with the unemployment people tomorrow.  Redid my resume, and Stamford CT.  Three cover letters in one day while still depressed is a lot.  :)

I've moved around a lot in order to move up in the industry.  I really thought I was good to go here, and I would kind of like to stay in the Boston area...but I guess I have to take what I can get.

During the day if I keep busy with cover letters or someone to talk to I've been ok.  But once 9pm rolls around and it's just me and the TV I get pretty down.  Westminster Kinnel Club isn't working for the cheer up tonight.

Ah well.  It feels good to get out there.  And I appreciate you taking the time to read this and offering any words of encouragement.  I know finding out the reason why will likely never happen

She has problems with the way I speak to her even though I am a calm and nonconfrontational person. When we fight I really strive to be calm, and other horrible things. This devastates me every time I hear it

Tonight the argument escalated to the point of screaming, ""i want to kill myself. I want to die."" This shocked and scared me immensely, and though I told her that, and.tried to talk to her, she was hysterical. I was reaching a breaking point myself, so I stepped out of the house to calm down. Came back in because I was afraid she would hurt herself. She again raves about how I don't give a shit about her....now this really broke my brain, because minutes ago I was clearly scared and upset at her self-threatening words. These accusations are so damaging to me.

Something in me snapped and I left the house and called the police explaining what happened and that I was extremely worried. She's calling me nonstop so I pick up and tell her I'm sorry, I can't do this, I called the police. She was furious. They came over and spoke with us. They took her to a hospital to speak to someone, which they're obligated to do in a situation where self-threats are made. She complied but was beyond angry that I called them to intervene.

I think I did the right thing but she is seething at this point. I'm scared of what's going to happen. I'm very shaken and upset. I called the hospital after a while to see what was going on and spoke with her. She thinks what I did was an act of betrayal- ""you knew I wasn't serious when I said that! How could you do this to me? I'm so humiliated.."" she is mad beyond words and tells me I did a horrible

I'm really nervous about seeing her when she is out. she is staying the night because there was no psychiatrist working at the hospital when they brought her

My brother is autistic and my family has always relied on me to be self-sufficient because of that. I got straight As without being pushed, served as an executive scout every year since I was 10, even won a few awards for my creative writing. I was really proud of myself for being able to achieve things I wanted in spite of my anxiety.

This year for whatever reason everything's gone to shit. Last year my average was 93 (not great but still) and this year I'm barely scraping an 80. Biology, which I got an 85% in last year, is so bad that my teacher wouldn't show me my last test mark for fear of upsetting me. I applied to university a few weeks ago and I don't even know if I'll be accepted, and I can sure as hell forget about any scholarships. All of those years of hard work mean nothing- this year's marks are all that matters and that's really frustrating.  

Meanwhile, but if I can't afford to go to residence then I don't know what will happen (hence the need for scholarships). My dad works most of the time and can't stand up for himself, much less make decisions for himself. They fight constantly and I've been waiting for them to get a divorce since I was 10- I really only just realized that most people's parents don't act this way. And as horrible as this may sound, I don't really have a relationship with my dad, despite living with him all my life. 

I called Kids Help Phone a few days ago to speak with a counselor, and when I answered yes to both, she just laughed and said she didn't expect me to say yes. I would never attempt for attention though. I think about suicide a lot but I don't think I'm suicidal yet. Fuck, I don't even know if I'm technically depressed. I know that my situation isn't that bad and that there are lots of people that have it worse than I do, which only makes me feel worse because I can't get my shit together. Somebody told me to get over myself because I'm just looking for attention, and maybe I am, but that doesn't invalidate my feelings. I hate myself and the situation I've put myself in. I just feel really sad and hopeless and helpless all the time and I just don't see an end.

We were in a fight at the time.,missinmyowl,17,4,4,"I don't know why I am reaching out to Reddit for this right now. I guess it is because he was an avid Reddit(er?) and was so proud when he made the front page one day lol. So here ya go Reddit. MMFB.

I was in a relationship with my boy for 5 years. The beginning of our relationship was not so great. He cheated, he woke up, and started treating me really fucking amazing. I think by that point, I knew I deserved better and when he started treating me how I felt he should have, I took it for granted. I pushed him away until finally he broke up with me. He expected me to fight for it, but I saw it as a way out. 2 weeks later, he wanted me back but I wanted differently. I wanted my chance to be independent and do what I wanted to do. You see, that gave me the opportunity to do me first. I was loving it. 

We still talked almost everyday and were really good friends. I was ok with just being friends but he wasnt. He never gave me the opportunity to miss him because he was always there when I needed help or someone to talk to. Again

When we were dating, I am no muggle. I have struggled with my own addictions, and those happened to be uppers, not downers. We would fight constantly about this. He would argue that if I could do my drugs, he could do his. I would argue that he could never tell when I was on mine unless I told him so, whereas he was a completely different person on his. A person I didn't like. This was definitely a factor in our break-up.

When we broke up, you can't really OD on percs. Right? Little to my knowledge, he was up to buying 20 30mgs a week.

After much digging around after he died, He was telling everyone else about it but me. He still had the hope of us getting back together and didnt want to ruin it. Oh how I wish he would have told me. Nobody else did either. 

On November 2nd, maybe grab a beer and catch up. The friend found him in the apartment with a needle turning blue. 911 was obviously called and he was pronounced dead 45 minutes later.

So the guilt trip begins. I cannot stop coming to the conclusion that this is all my fault. I won't hear it from any of you that it was not. I knew when we were together that he was depressed and suicidal. I pushed him away from me so that I could go about doing my own thing KNOWING that he had a history of depression. His addiction was controlled when he was with me, but it seems that in his state of mind, he may not have had a death wish, but didn't care whether he stayed or went.

Though we were not together at the time, I started to miss him. The one thing I wanted and he wouldn't allow me to do. Now it is too late and I will miss him always. He treated me like a princess and I never saw it until now. I will forever regret taking him for granted and causing the deep depression that (I believe) ended his life.

At the beginning of my depression, I ended up thinking about it negatively because I instantly seen it as a learning disability, so I couldn't achieve the potentials I ever wanted. Throughout the whole year, I was faking my emotions around people, all the time, when I was on my own I would he depressed, frustrated to think of all the things I want when I couldn't achieve them. (I want to be a psychologist, philosopher and a car mechanic.) As I previously stated, which kind of helped hiding what I was angry about. 

Within the second year of depression contained the worst moments of my life, I would cry 6 times a week average, on the toilet or in my room, if someone was in my room I'd pretend to be constipated and be crying for 30 minutes, I'd even be watching my tears hit the ground and wishing it was me falling to an instant death. I also lost plenty of sleep over it too, I was awake for 5 days straight because of the headaches I got from thinking frequently about my aspergers. Of course I didn't want to think about it, but the thought would hit me every day. One day in November, I was standing on my window ledge getting ready to jump. I had planned to right a 50 page suicide note on how much I loved everyone, I was so good at faking emotions that people thought I was getting happier

Only this year back in January I was still depressed, thinking is was something small, them one day I was sitting in the back of my car and my mother decided to show her picture of me as a kid, tears rolled down my face and then she asked ""are you ok?"" I replied with an ""I'm fine"" even though I wasn't. That day we were driving around for 8 hours and I cracked, began to cry alot, pulled some of my hair out in stress and then my family brought me home. 

I have discussed the whole thing with my mother and she pointed out that since it's invisible to most people if not everyone, Bill Gates or Bob Dylan had aspergers, look how successful they are! When I had found that out I was suprised that they had it, then the greatest thought struck me. ""If people that know about aspergers can't point it out on them, this could mean everyone could seem the same with me, no matter who they are or what they have."" 

Now I'm 5 months out of my depression

I hope you now feel better and that I've possibly helped you with your depression

Your conclusion is to always tell someone you can trust. You are never alone. Here's a tip from my own insight (May not work for everyone). You'll have shit times in life

Music can help you a lot. I like plenty of music genres, I felt the lyrics connected to how I felt which made me smile in honesty for a while which was hard to do at the time. I still listen to their music today and I'm glad it had helped me (i am not/never was a goth or an emo by the way.)

a week before my 8th birthday, attorneys, court counselors, saw therapists, etc. as a result of the evidence saved, my very detailed description (of the events, the man, location


i am also the child of divorce. my parents split when i was 2, and to be able to trust men. my father has never been very affectionate, and i lived the majority of the time with my mom. thus, it was that my stepfather became the ""loving"" father figure in my life.


i cannot pinpoint exactly how long after the kidnapping occurred that this began, my stepdad would come into my room to ""cuddle"" with me. he would bring books and read me stories, or tell me stories about his daughter when she was my age, or other things. he began tickling my arm, by rubbing his hands very slowly back and forth. gentle affectionate things like this are okay, right? but one night he kissed me. not just on the forehead, like a father might


i still wanted him to cuddle with me. i was still the scared little girl who needed to know men were okay, and got worse. he would french kiss me, he would touch my body (never my genitals directly), but still, he would ""caress"" me. i had a pair of pajamas that were silky, a tank with matching shorts. when i would wear these, he made comments on how sexy i looked. frequently. he began making comments while i was around the house, how he liked when i wore that. i didn't really understand.


one night, and made my spine tingle, and it was strange. i didn't know whether i liked it or not, it was just what it was. i didn't really understand that either. that was on a friday ngight, because in the morning, my mom, his son, and i all went to McD's to eat breakfast. mom was sitting to my left in the booth, but on another level


the thing with my stepdad went on for several months. on one occasion, but when he brought my mom up, my viewpoint changed. i thought to myself ""why did he bring mom up? is this something wrong that mom would not like?"" i stopped wanting him to cuddle with me after, although he sometimes would try to come in. i told him, shouting from my bed into the open hallway door ""NO! i don't want you, i want to cuddle with mom instead!"" sometimes, mom would come in, and eventually i stopped cuddling with anyone altogether.


when i mention that i began lying, and the deepest, most painful memory i had kept repressed. i tried once, at 17, to tell my mom what happened. she chalked it up to my being ""imaginative"" and ""making this up"" after my ordeal. i was too weak to tell her, and put it away again. at 22, after leaving an abusive relationship, and not in full honesty. my anxiety was stemming from somewhere, and apologize. i am a very honest and open person, and ghosts of the past (i do not know details


so, and she dismisses me again. it is so difficult to say things to her, such as the time he took his pants off and i felt an erection on my leg. i told her this, for example, and she says ""well, what was he wearing?!"" (i don't know, boxers? he was not fully naked, xxxxx doesn't EVEN WEAR boxers, she tells me i was imaginative, and told her how much anxiety i have over this)


during the first therapy session


my mom doesn't care about something that has hurt her daughter more than anything. although i was able to confront my kidnapper, talking with my longterm boyfriend, the only person who i could share anything with. he encouraged me to tell her, and i got it thrown in my face. as a capable adult, i'm having it thrown in my face and it is devastating me. i have panic attacks and high anxiety around my mom as a result of this. i cannot comprehend how a person who wanted to kill a man who harmed her daughter can so easily dismiss something as psychologically damaging as this. we have had 3 sessions total. even though it has been months since i told her, she did not set up an appointment for over two months. this is not important to her, this is not something she seems to even want to understand, and my anguish


**tl;dr**: i was a kidnapping victim around age 8, french kissing me, calling me sexy, etc. i lived in denial and realized this event was the source of my anxiety, and the reason i was living my life a certain way (epiphany after leaving abusive relationship). mom and i go to therapy, and she doesn't believe me. i don't think she ever will. she continues to hang with him, and i have terrible anxiety and a strained relationship with her because i feel like she cannot, understand something that is terribly hard for me to even say.

So this is what my life looks like:

* I am a single dad with an autistic kid. He's not difficult

* His mom (my first wife) lives in another country and is in the process of reassigning  gender. 

* My second wife left me last year. After moving from our apartment to a home for abused mothers for several months (I didn't abuse anyone, but I can't help wishing it (and wishing her son away in the process, which makes me feel guilty).

* My dad, that I had to severely restrict any contact with her, as her behaviour was becoming impossible. That means there's only my son and me. I have no other support whatsoever.

* Actually I do have a friend and she expressed willingness to babysit my son

* I am burdened with a degenerative disc disease and a congenital spinal defect

* I have a bipolar disorder

* I also have a genetic predisposition to diabetes (almost all my immediate ancestors had it) and high cholesterol. It doesn't help that I'm obese (gained 60 lbs in the year I started taking medicine for bipolar). It makes my back

* Food however makes me feel good and makes my life bearable at times when everything is just too overwhelming. Now this just plain sucks. The only thing that makes me feel better

* Hay fever for two and a half months every years suck all pleasure from the nicer weather that starts in the spring. It negates the good things I could look forward to. I'm also allergic to a million other things. So as much as I'd love to get a cat

* With my physical and mental problems

* Because I'm absent from work so much

* I have a nearly finished university degree and another college degree

* My doctors are no help anymore. My GP sends me to my psychiatrist. My psychiatrist just shakes her head in disbelief over my reactions (says I'm a phenomenon) and that's it. Apart from the regular therapy for the bipolar

* Because I've been feeling very sick and tired for th last two months, take the trash out and keep things moderately decent. Recently it's a trash heap in the middle of my living room, where I'm camping on the couch.

I make sure my son is fed and that he goes to school in clean clothes without tears in them (something my parents didn't really care about), bringing me down even further.


Anyway, to make me feel better. I just needed a place to vent my pent up feelings of frustration. It will probably get better with time.

Things have actually gotten worse. Because I am in remission, no energy and my moods swing like crazy. I also have a great deal of nerve pain from damaged nerves from surgery, which at this point, my doctors are telling me, may by there for the rest of my life.
So here I am, in pain, and addicted to pain pills with no one to talk to. My best friend is in Afghanistan, serving the miltary while his wife is at home pregnant, so I don't feel comfortable going to him with my problems. The one person I used to talk to a lot was the most amazing, beautiful, and genuine person I have met in my life time, we haven't talked much.
Talking to her is a bit of double edged sword cause it just reminds me how I am in position to pursue a relationship right now
All I want is to feel like myself again, get in shape and be happy again. Though I don't see that happening any time soon with the depression, pain pill addiction, and nerve pain which makes it very hard to walk or stand for a very long period of time.
To make matters worse I applied for financial support to help with my doctor bills and other financial needs since I obviously can't work and I was denied. I resubmitted but I am not very optimistic

i've been looking forward to my birthday for months now. and he knows that. i was hoping he might suck it up and at least be civil with me for the big day. when i went out at midnight, he spent the whole night telling me i'd be better off without him, that he doesn't want to be alive, that he's going to pack up his stuff and move out, etc...

he yelled at me for getting phone calls that woke him up at 1 PM this morning. he said he was going to start packing his things, told him ""good, get out,"" and sat on the floor and cried. it was quite a dramatic scene! i do regret acting out, but three days of this is a lot. ...and its my birthday!!

he told me that no one cares its my birthday as he left. i don't know when he'll be back. but i can't leave until he does because he didn't take his keys and he has no cell phone. he's just out there with his bike. and this is why i need your input

i am so worried about where he is, but if he's sorry and there's something going on i'll hear him out.

Right now, and I have a nice vehicle and pretty nice things. I'm not made of money, but I can pay my bills and have a little left over for things I want.

When trying to talk to others about what bothers me

I am a very loving guy. I like the idea of romance and relationships and I haven't really had a tough time finding girls... but finding the right type of girls is difficult. There are tons of girls that get VERY interested in me only after they hear about what I do or see where I live or what I drive. I think it clouds their judgement of me.

I've been girlfriendless for over a year. My last relationship ended like all of my other relationships: she cheated on me. This has happened to me so many times it's unreal. But I started kind of seeing another girl recently. I admit

Anyways, and not take life serious or have zero ambition. I am glad I left them behind.. but now I don't have anybody to relate with or hang out with. And because of the profession I chose involving firearms.. some people don't like doing what I like to do like going shooting. And I'm not totally in ""adult mode"" yet. I still like to have fun. I feel like I'm too young to settle down and I'm too old to be irresponsible. 

All I do these days is work on growing my business and at the end of the day.. I go home and just try to find something to do. Watch TV, play a video game. It's just not satisfying. It's lonely. And since I fucked shit up with the girl I was seeing it's even worse and I realized how much I really liked her.

I mean what if we had kids and he physically abused them into their teen years and emotionally abused them at every given oppourtunity?!  Oh wait that sounds familiar...

My stepmother has pulmonary fibrosis (her lungs are hardening) and a whole mess of other things wrong with her, her and my dad had an argument and the stress made her illness worse and she went to the hospital. (It was not a physical fight, my dad is not stupid enough to hit her.) They sent her to ICU because of her condition, and she went on life support. They kept her under heavy sedation and had to restrain her wrists so she wouldn't rip the breathing tube in her throat out while she was asleep. She was on life support for over a week. Whenever we would visit her, her eyes would flutter open, but only for a moment before the nurses rushed in and shooed us out the door. They didn't want her to wake up, because her heart rate would go up and she would try breathing on her own. Understandable in a way

I arrived at my dad's house the day after she had gone to the hospital, dad finally decided to tell me. After the argument between him and my stepmom, dad decided he was going to get drunk. Bad idea, he's an ex-alcoholic. He also has multiple emotional and psychological problems, and takes several different medications just to get through the day. I'm assuming he blamed himself for stressing her out so badly that she ended up on life support, but i'm not sure. I didn't pry too much into his reasoning, he does what I do and keeps everything bottled up inside. And i'm not sure how to say this, but I need to just say it and get it off my chest because the more I think about it

He went into the backyard

It didn't kill him however, but suffered no severe injuries and was sent home.

The day before I left to go back home, but I honestly could not handle staying down there too much longer--I love them all very dearly, but it's very stressful visiting them. Not to mention, most of the people in the house (though they're full-grown adults) don't even bother working, and I felt awful staying down there and not contributing anything. So I went home.



About two weeks ago, they did an upper GI, and found an ulcer in his stomach the size of a golf ball. When they did a biopsy, the doctor said it looked cancerous, but they wouldn't know for sure until the test results came back two weeks later. I'm not sure if he has received the results or not.

Yesterday morning, I answered when he called. She was in the hospital because she had pneumonia, but was being rushed to emergency surgery, she had a perforated bowel.

I'm just worried that with her lungs and body in as bad shape as it is, it won't be for very long. And when she does finally pass, i'm afraid my dad will try to commit suicide again. If it turns out he does have cancer, I don't know what they're going to do--they can't survive off of his disability checks alone.

1376675345.0,1ki173,My best friend slept with my ex and has been dating him for a month while lying to me,swervemyheart,15,2,14,"My best friend and as of today ex-roommate and I have had a rocky friendship over the past 6 months to a year. I was dating and in love with someone who she didn't care for and she felt like keeping him in my life was me choosing him over her.

When we eventually broke up, I got a call from my ex and ended up sleeping with him (which is absolutely still cheating even if I had plans to end my current relationship and yes, I do feel awful about it).

In the few months I was dating guy #2

I was clearly uncomfortable with this, she wasn't at all attracted to him, and promised nothing would ever happen between them. She also argued that just like she couldn't make me stop being friends with guy #1 (even though she certainly tried), I couldn't make her stop being friends with guy #2. 

So I did my best to accept it and went out of my way to be friendly to him when he was around (while he ignored me and never made eye contact) as well as listening to her stories about their friendship. They quickly became best friends and she was no longer around at all.

After about two weeks she confronted me and said that I was not trying hard enough in our friendship and I was pulling away. I explained that I wasn't comfortable with her being best friends with my ex, etc.) I felt that I didn't really have anything to connect with her on. This blew up into a huge argument where she screamed at me that I was a bad friend. 

We made up

Last night, and that she wasn't trying to hurt me. She said that she thought it would just be casual sex, but they fell in love (like casual sex wouldn't be a betrayal?).

Interestingly, it would have been difficult, but I would have eventually accepted the relationship, just as I was accepting the friendship. Instead, she TEXT me the night before she moved out, when she knew I wouldn't be home, and told me me that she'd been hiding this from me for a month. According to her the ball was now in my court.

Now I've decided that she is not someone I need to have in my life. She hasn't been the same person for a while. I can understand why it happened certainly - she has really low self esteem and daddy issues and therefore needs as much love and affection as possible and doesn't care where it comes from (married men at work, you name it). She felt like I had chosen guy #1 over her so she justified it to herself.

My issue is the feeling of betrayal. I trusted her completely and even though we had been having issues

And is this my fault? I've certainly made mistakes. Maybe I wasn't as good a friend as I could have been. Do I deserve this?

And how do I deal with this? We haven't spoken. I never responded to her text. I'm not going to see her before she moves out today. Should I just give up and forget she exists? Should we have a conversation (and inevitably an argument because she never admits fault) with her for some sort of closure?

I just feel so lost and confused.

original thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jdkr2/i_have_to_break_up_with_a_girl_who_lives_6_hours/

Ok so based on your suggestions in that last thread

There's something i have to say.  You know, my friends tell me they love me every day. I don't understand how you love me for real, you don't even know me. You have no idea what I'm like. Like you literally just talked to me and you're already in love with me. I don't get it. Its too much for me. You said that my quotes saved your life, but that's not me, that's just the stuff that inspires me.

I have severe anxiety and I do a lot things impulsively out of fear without thinking. I'm not depressed, I'm so sorry for misleading you.

Look, I really do, you're really sweet and caring. It's just that I'm not looking for a relationship right now. And a relationship between you and me can't work out. We live like 6 hours away and barely know each other. Look everything will be fine don't worry, I'll be here if you need anything. I used to be depressed. But I soon started to realize that one day everything will be ok, things don't stay the way they are forever, the future has so much to offer. Here's a quote that ought to help you: ""Going through hell? Keep going.""
 
I'm going to send it to her soon. Once I do I'm blocking her on instagram. And on Kik

Something unsettling just happened. She told me she's going to be staying in my town for 5 days. I have no idea if its because of me. But now I feel worse. This has gone really far. Shit just got real. I have to send it.

-	Depression: On and off, and I haven’t found a new primary care doctor yet.

-	Medical issues: I suffer from insomnia and migraines, and I don’t want my doctor to think I just want them recreationally.  Also, as of 3 weeks ago, I’ve had constant back pain, and was diagnosed at the ER with degenerative disc disorder (same thing my mom’s had 5 surgeries to help fix).

-	Job: My current job is more rewarding, I’m starting to get bored, and therefore I’m slacking in areas I should excel at.  I’m a member of management, and my bosses are very understanding, but I know there’s only so much they will take before booting me (more on that later)

-	6 months ago

-	A lot of my old debts are continuing to add up from when I was out of work.  My credit is beyond just “bad” at this point, so it’s hard to even keep up with my regular bills.

-	I was excited because I only had 1 payment left on my car.  I had planned on paying it off and saving for a year to put a down payment on something I really wanted.  In March, the timing chain broke (they replaced belts with chains in a lot of cars so they WOULDN’T break).  This blew out the engine, and the car was basically totaled (it would have cost me more to fix this than the car was even worth).  I sold the car online, and had to use that money to make my final payment, and send the guy the title.

-	I ended up renting a car for a month

-	Finally, he said if I sell his car privately, I can use the money to put toward my down payment on something for myself.

-	About 2 weeks before my mom’s surgery, and sent her home.

-	I had to bring my mom to the hospital for her surgery early in the morning on April 17th.  I couldn’t sleep the night before, and got scolded for it by my boss.

-	A week later, and will probably end up like my mom in a couple years.

-	A couple weeks ago

-	My mom isn’t supposed to be driving

-	2 days later

-	When someone came down to look at it, starter issues, timing belt, etc.), and ended up only getting $1300 for it.

-	Last Friday, did some seemingly unrelated tests which all came back negative, gave her more meds, and sent her home.  I missed another day of work.

-	Saturday and Sunday I went car shopping

-	Monday morning, they did some appropriate tests and found out it WAS her gall bladder.  They admitted her to the hospital and scheduled surgery for Tuesday (scheduled for 12:00pm, finally went in at 5:30pm due to timing issues with the surgeon).

-	On Wednesday

-	The doctors told my mom she was going home on Wednesday.  She said she wasn’t ready

-	From Monday to Wednesday, black lab/German shepherd mix).  When my mom got home on Thursday, the dog was in major, major pain.  My mom and brother broke down, and my mom had to call the vet to see her.  The dog was in major pain, and they ended up putting her down last night.  I spent another night over her house on suicide watch for both her and my brother.  My mom feels she killed her best friend, and my brother blames himself for not being able to take care of her.  I tell them both to remember the good times, and she is no longer in pain...

-	They messed up the date on my mom’s post-surgery script

-	Today, and I should come down with the $2900.  Apparently she meant I need an ADDITIONAL $1900 to the other $1300 down.  I told her I can’t do that, and I can’t get the car after all.

I’m trying to be strong for my mom and brother for loosing their dog, and I feel I can’t deal with everything I’m dealt at this point.  If it wasn’t for my brother, my best friend, and especially my boyfriend, I honestly wouldn’t be alive to type this.

1369126736.0,1er5yk,My uncle just died and a fellow driver's actions/words cut me to pieces unexpectedly.,takemeouttotheblack,15,1,4,"**warning**: includes some vulgar swearwords which were the other driver's words.

**TDLR**: from a close family, drove home to take care of parent's dogs, I (20F) was cut off by another and after giving him the finger he called me a ""fucking cunt."" Also, I'm really sorry for the length of this.

**the back story**

My family's an incredibly close Irish Canadian type family, close family.

There's this one uncle I have who lives across the field with my aunt/godmother. When my dad was being treated for leukemia as a young child, godmother.

At some point, a fighter, and battled through. Enter the start of this school year. He was bad, in ICU in Toronto hospitals where I visited with my dad, but then he got better for a bit. Came home, had to go back in. Worried, he got better

I left home (still live with parents, etc) to house sit for a week starting last week. I missed his decline while away apparently and my mom gets a hold of me and tells me my uncle's in ICU again, in palliative care, and if I could would I please take care of the dogs tonight. It's a stat holiday here in Canada, so of course as a part timer my lovely minimum wage coffee slinging job has me scheduled and even though I wanted to, I couldn't see my uncle right away. Blessing in disguise though, holiday meant work was slow and the supervisor needed someone to leave because we weren't making enough money so I volunteered. Headed to the hospital, saw all my aunts and uncles. Saw my uncle and godmother.

He was so small, a huge stride which I've always struggled to keep up with when on walks with the dogs, my dad, and him. But there he was, small. Fragile, hooked up to stuff, lying there. I could barely compose myself to hug my godmother and had to leave the room. Pick up a bag of comfort food on the way.

Eventually I had to leave, uncles, parents, and cousin. I shower in hopes of shaking it off - I didn't want to return to the house sitting job rattled because I was doing the job with the help of my boyfriend and my sister's boyfriend (sister's away for the summer). Put on a nice dress in hopes of feeling slightly better about something. Start driving back into town for house sitting. 

Get up to a light, look up and there's an SUV in the lane beside me. Just had that feeling he was going to cut me off. Voila, he does. But I didn't want him to get in first. I just wanted a win for the day. Was that too much to ask?

I lost my composure, and unable to deal. I wanted it because I couldn't handle seeing my godmother cry, couldn't imagine how my dad must feel with this being his brother, and for my cousin's son who will never know his grandpa. I wanted it because I hate working at Tim Horton's, hate smelling of coffee, hate my manager who's a creep and see no end in sight. I hate that I'm not where I want to be money wise and that I need this coffee job desperately. I wanted it because my summer school class tomorrow is on probability theory and that was the single most hardest concept for me the first time I did this damn course.  I wanted it because despite the dress I did not feel good about how I looked and the guilt of the comfort food I had packed. I wanted it because my closest friend and big sister was unreachable in this time. I wanted it because I hate the city I was house sitting in and the dog which whines and eats the bagels I bought. I just wanted to be first in that lane. Just once.

But he won narrowly, I was defeated, and I do regret my action. I don't simply mean I lost, I was defeated. Down for the count, another strike to the ledger, fml. It seemed like a good idea then, it was in the heat of the moment and not a thing I was proud of or typically would do. I failed as a person and Canadian by acting so rudely, windows down as it's warm. He sarcastically claps. I flip another bird as I'm fighting tears behind my sunglasses. I hear him saying something loudly

The reason why I don't race people on the roads normally and flip birds is because of respect to other people. I see customers at the drive through who are complete assholes and try to think of what their day has been like - perhaps their boss is an asshole, maybe they're going through a rough break up, maybe their parents were jerks and never taught them better, who knows. I look at everyone and believe each personis unique and fighting their own battles, living a life full of actions and reactions that lead to situations and I try not to judge based on small instances and make matters worse. I like to brighten days, look for optimism. I serve your coffee with a smile and genuinely care when I ask how was your day. Today wasn't that day though, my day was too sucky and I couldn't do it myself. But fuck it, this is what I want while my uncle's dying in the hospital."" Light turned

We'll fast forward the rest of the time. Meet up with boyfriend at that house, crying a lot, in a strange house, get to return home tomorrow but can't wait to cry in my own bed, can't deal well even though this sadly isn't a first funeral type thing for me. Grandma on other side died two months ago, lost all other grandparents before, and a cousin. feeling very stupid and childish because of the crying

**A paranoid parrot appears**

Another reason why I'm unable to sleep because of all this is because about two weeks ago I delivered a food plate my mom wrapped up for my aunt to put in her fridge from when she came home from the hospital and I'm scared that this is all my fault. I've had a bit of a head cold the past week and my throat was sore in the morning that I delivered the plate. I'm afraid that since my uncle was so sick and vulnerable,,False,,t5_2sjdn,False,,True
