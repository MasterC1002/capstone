I've lurked here a bit, as well as age, gender, and total score. I was partially curious whether including a gun/knife might give a boost to peoples' scores.

I only analyzed posts in the last 14 days, etc). Total sample was 114 submissions. Here's a few results!

Posters over the past two weeks have been 89.5% male and 10.5% female.

* 14.9% carry guns
* 71.1% carry knives
* 35.1% carry multitools (which have knives)
* 79.2% carry either a knife or multitool or both.

On average


On average

Stray observations:

* People with nice cameras / non-blurry pictures do far better.
* Age and karma are correlated (older posters do better).
* There's a 14 year old kid around here who carries three knives on him.

Discuss.

EDIT: This post now has more than the average 42.19 karma. And I did it without knives,False,self,t5_2reni,1374213314.0,,,t3_1ilrc0

The guy was okay, illuminate things as a few more of us got the vehicle back onto it's wheels, and perhaps most importantly, to direct traffic and to signal other cars to slow the hell down and not hit the immobilized SUV in the middle of the pitch-black road (as they came flying around the corner 50 yards ahead).

I realized that this whole thing would have been significantly more dangerous and difficult without such a simple tool as a AAA flashlight and just wanted to share.

1368546992.0,1ebjed,How my EDC Leatherman saved my Parent's House,braveally,212,44,44,"Just a story about my Leatherman and how it saved my ass. I just shared it on their site and figured I would here as well since it was a critical part of my daily EDC and what I consider to be the very reason why I still continue the practice.

Some years back
Funny thing about this yard door was that it locked whenever closed and can only be opened from the inside. You would not believe the shock on my face when I heard the locking slam of the door behind me
Not only were we the only ones there
The only thing I had was my trusty Leatherman Charge Ti. I was looking for any entry point into the house and noticed the aging burglar bars on the dining room window. I whipped out my Leatherman and went to the plier tool and started successfully unscrewing the closest bolt to me. The smoke alarm started to go off at this point and I could see the smoke moving into the dining area. Once I got the first bolt out there was enough room to pry the bars back and get in through the window. We keep the dining room windows unlocked because we have the bars in place and we never use them. Great
By this point my friend was nearly in tears thinking he would be partially responsible for burning my parent's house. After I handled everything in the house (including putting my keys and phone in my pockets) I opened the backyard door to let my friend back in. The awe on his face at  the ability of this pocket tool to get us out such an intense situation is a look I will always remember. I just smiled, now they know the importance of being ready for everything.

1347607817.0,zv8d8,EDC for our Vehicles.,plethoraofpinatas,131,17,78,"We are always talking about our pocket EDC. What would you add to your car/truck EDC to make it the best setup? Call it a EDC-V of sorts perhaps.

Here's some ideas:

* bottled water

* stable food - beef jerky, etc.

* cash - pay for tow, etc.

* first aid kit

* [12 volt air compressor](http://www.amazon.com/Slime-COMP02-12-Volt-Tire-Inflator/dp/B000ENQRD2)

* [tow strap](http://www.amazon.com/Polyester-Strap-Rope-Hooks-10000lb/dp/B0055WP48Q) - especially in snow country.

* duct tape - cures most everything but buy quality brands only (3M

* [jumper cables](http://www.amazon.com/Coleman-Cable-08660-Heavy-Duty-Glo-Watt/dp/B00002243Y) - long

* [mechanics wire](http://www.amazon.com/StovePipe-Mechanics-Wire-BLACK-Misc/dp/B000FPCEMM) - a spool of this can tie up any exhaust

* maps - state maps of the places you go AND a [state topo guide for your state](http://www.amazon.com/Oregon-Atlas-Gazetteer-Delorme/dp/0899333478/ ) - the details in them are unbelievable and available at the bigger gas stations

* flashlight - Here's a [highly recommend one](http://www.amazon.com/Fenix-Flashlights-E21-Flashlight/dp/B0041NE8TG/) that would work very well for an emergency vehicle light and is affordable. Plus it will run AA batteries. Buy the Energizer lithium variety and they can sit in the trunk for ten years and be ready to work without exploding and turning to goo. They also run longer. Feel free to ask /r/flashlight for help - we take requests.

* [tool bag](http://www.amazon.com/Stanley-STST70574-12-Inch-Soft-Sided/dp/B00775COIW/) - filled with common tools: ratchet set, small 10"" - 12"" pry bar, pliers, screwdriver w/ extensive changeable tip kit, wire stripper, black tape, lightweight work gloves (jersey gloves), allen wrench set in metric and SAE

* [spare fuse kit](http://www.amazon.com/Grip-150-Auto-Fuse-Set/dp/B001A567ME/) - a set of assorted mini's and regular. A kit like this will save lots of money compared to buying only one when you need it at ten times the price. Plus more real life karma for being able to help others because you have the selection.

* [spare key in magnetic lock box](http://www.amazon.com/Lucky-Line-91201-Extra-Magnetic/dp/B000MVFLCY/) hidden under car - much cheaper than a locksmith's $80 slim jim job.

* [roll of blue shop towels](http://www.amazon.com/Kimberly-Clark-Scott-Towels-75130/dp/B000TRQHXS) - like regular paper towels on 'roids. You'll use them a lot.

* [waterless hand cleaner](http://www.amazon.com/Sunshine-42150-Simple-Green-Cleaner/dp/B001DENLNK) - because having filthy

* [wool blanket](http://www.amazon.com/Israeli-Wool-Blanket-Military-Surplus/dp/B004X6DHNY/) - army surplus type

* [self standing long burn candle in container](http://www.amazon.com/Hour-Plus-Emergency-Candle-Clear/dp/B0002I1TCI/) - for cold weather country and used with the blanket

* car cell phone charger - with everything going to mini-usb there is really no excuse not to have a backup. Cell phones save lives. If not

* jug of kitty litter - cold weather country again, or oil spill to get it out of your way.

This will all fit in a small Rubbermaid type container and relive you of worry so you can drive and know you are covered for the majority of typical problems. You are also ready to be the hero for those that did not prepare and that's a great feeling when it happens. Even if your mechanical skills are not that great

Other tips for the best car EDC?

.

Edit - submitted good ideas:

* tarp - to wrap a body in

* knife - the original tool

* small shovel

* any old cell phone - 911 will work in the US even without a service plan

* change of clothes - in case you unexpectedly overnight somewhere or mess yourself up

* spare warm coat, insulated boots - for cold weather areas, bright colored hat/coat helps visibility

* small garbage bags - to clean out the vehicle or as puke bags for passengers - and many other uses",self,t5_2reni,1359001683.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/EDC/comments/zv8d8/edc_for_our_vehicles/

I want to relate the issue to a more commonly discussed topic here, only watched videos/read articles online? We would probably call them an idiot, and a danger to themselves and the general public. It is generally well known that any tool, (not just guns) can be extremely dangerous when misused. However for some reason this logic does not seem to extend to medical equipment/first aid procedures for some people in /r/EDC.

I wanted to highlight two recent examples that typify this problem. 

1. The [medical kit](http://www.reddit.com/r/EDC/comments/ulcpn/as_promised_my_edc_med_kit/) of a bank employee in Chicago (I mention profession and location to emphasize that they are not in a remote area

1. The [medical portion](http://www.reddit.com/r/EDC/comments/usj0g/my_edc_bag_23muk/) of the EDC of an IT professional in the UK (also likely not far from a professional ambulance service). Again this person is packing serious first aid gear, and has no training[^1](http://www.reddit.com/r/EDC/comments/usj0g/my_edc_bag_23muk/c4y9u88).

It is absolutely admirable that people want provide aid to people in need, the result can actually cause harm to someone, instead of helping them.

You may also think that causing inadvertent harm while attempting to provide first aid, but certain states in the US (I'm not familiar with laws outside of the US) only afford protection to healthcare professionals like doctors, nurses, EMTs, etc. This includes, for example, [Alabama](http://www.heartsafeam.com/files/Alabama_Good_Samaritan_Act.pdf), you can still end up as the target of a lawsuit,00.html)

Before anyone who lives in an urban environment adds things like QuikClot, please please please pick up a few pairs of gloves and a CPR (to protect yourself from disease), the supplies for a basic bandage, and take a damn first aid course so you can do things like assess vital signs (pulse/respiration/skin condition/cap refill/level of consciousness). This will let you provide useful information to 911/the real EMTs when they arrive.

For first aid/first responder courses check out the [Red Cross](http://www.redcross.org/portal/site/en/menuitem.d8aaecf214c576bf971e4cfe43181aa0/?vgnextoid=58d51a53f1c37110VgnVCM1000003481a10aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=default) or its respective websites in your country of residence.

Just a few quick things about guns/knives:

* Yes

* Read the FAQ on the right and learn about why we carry these tools before asking us why.

* People often post images with 2 or 3 guns/knives

* If you have any questions about this, across many governments and all have different norms that we grew up with. For example, a person in Texas has a more gun-friendly mentality than someone who grew up in So-Cal.

Knives are tools. Do people look at kitchen knives and go ""Why do you have knives in your kitchen!?!? Is it really that dangerous of a place that you need knives!?"" No

People also carry guns. So what? They like to be prepared. They may never use them, IS a case of self defense. Most likely (and I really hope so...) these people are permitted to carry concealed, and have the proper training to do so. 

Personally, or what they're used for? No, not unless I tell you, and a picture of my EDC can't do that very easily. I break down an average of 50+ boxes a day for my job. I live in a state that allows open carry of firearms, and people out here DO exercise that right. My fiancee owns horses and we're looking at getting into some ranch property, where you better damn well have a knife on you for chores.

- read the FAQ for why people carry guns and knives. It's been asked numerous times in many different ways

- We come from different countries, so it's out of the norm for me to see someone carrying a Metro card or something that's needed in a big city.

- We don't always post phones or keys or wallet because these are fairly damn standard. We like to show off new or unique items that we have.

- Read the rules please. If you have a question

- Please post your EDC! Give us some background, and a list of what the items are in the picture. If you feel that something is unique to your carry, like a special silver coin, explain the significance to you, and why you carry it.

* Cold Steel AK-47. Excellent EDC knife for very hard use. I've been thumping on this thing for about 6 months now
* Under the knife is my EDC notebook. A [Sokkia Level Book](http://www.engineersupply.com/sokkia-level-book-815255.aspx). I've noticed that a lot of folks carry a small notebook. [These level books](http://www.engineersupply.com/field-books.aspx?gclid=CPSq7K3Oz7YCFWNlMgodVggAjw) are about $10, aside from developing a small curve, the binding is still together and everything in it is still legible, despite being soaked numerous times. Here is the inside of the book: http://imgur.com/Xmu07Hg, and here is what's written on the last page http://imgur.com/rd3roSJ

As many of you all have seen

As we have stated before, to the student in Sweden, in order to share ideas and interesting tidbits about lives around the world.  /r/edc is now about arguing about politics and religion, things we thought this subreddit could escape from.

Effective immediately, but we now feel it would be best to transition this subreddit to be dedicated to the Electric Daisy Carnival.

Thank you for the years of submissions, and feedback.  We hope that the new /r/edc provides the friendly atmosphere that reddit users look for, and unifies users not on what they carry on a daily basis... but on the [**dance floor...**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u-vmk9iapQ).

Thank you again
