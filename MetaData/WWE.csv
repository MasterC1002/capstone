1370806840.0,1fzwsg,How I would book Punk upon return.,OtherOtie,116,15,60,"Punk no-shows Payback

The next night on Raw, and using his music for his own advantage. Heyman was never Punk's manager like Brock and now Curtis, he was his associate, and his friend. But he's disrespected their friendship by making this about himself. 

Heyman apologizes to Punk

Over the next few weeks, teaming with Curtis Axel against Jericho and Triple H one night on Raw. Axel intentionally causes Punk to take the fall, and Heyman has to hold Punk back from hurting Axel.

Next week, but Punk says this isn't about Heyman, it's about teaching Axel a lesson. Heyman assures Punk that he's making the wrong decision, but Punk won't have any of it. 

It's Punk vs. Axel in the main event of Raw. The match is back and forth, occasionally pleading with the two not to hurt each other and that they should be on the same page. Punk hits the GTS on Axel and goes for the cover, but Heyman breaks it up and causes a DQ for Punk. 

Punk and Heyman argue, but he tells Heyman it's over, and his ""services"" are no longer required. Punk says he'll always be a Paul Heyman guy, but not like this.

Punk walks out on Heyman. It cuts to backstage, Axel hits him from behind. Paul Heyman is at his side: ""GET HIM AXEL! GET HIM!"" Axel completely incapacitates Punk, and the show fades to black with Axel and Heyman standing over him.

Next week, and Curtis Axel is going to show him how big a mistake Punk has truly made. At Money in the Bank, CM Punk will face Curtis Axel in a down and dirty street fight. 

It's Money in the Bank, and Punk is about to put Axel to sleep in the middle of the mat. Heyman runs in and delivers a low blow to Punk, letting Axel go for the pin. Punk kicks out and knocks Axel out with a kick to the head. Punk runs after Heyman and catches him in the GTS, when suddenly...

[BROCK LESNAR! IT'S BROCK LESNAR!](http://youtu.be/YToXwtyqmjM)

Piss runs down Punk's leg. He drops Heyman from the GTS and arms himself with a kendo stick. Lesnar roars on the stage and marches down to the ring. Punk is swinging the stick, and the ref pins... 1... 2... 3!

Curtis Axel has pinned CM Punk.

Heyman

So, they've created a perfect character.  Think about it: A self-aware company man, adored by children and more superficial fans, and despised by the more cynical and ""old-school"" fans.  He is face and heel wrapped up in one shtick.  Just by playing the same character he has for 10 years, he generates more heat AND more pop than any other superstar.

By keeping Cena as he is, even if they turn heel, will still be cheered and loved by a significant chunk of the audience, simply because they're not Cena.  So the tickets are sold to the shows through Cena, and the rest of us are kept happy by giving us matches involving CM Punk, Daniel Bryan, Kane, and many others.  Besides

Two former WWE writers have told PWTorch what they think Vince McMahon will do with Jack Swagger now that he's made headlines for a DUI and pot possession arrest.

Former WWE creative team member Court Bauer (@courtbauer) tells me this afternoon he wouldn't trust Jack Swagger again.

""Irresponsible and immature, stupid move by Swagger. This is RVD allll over again. I remember that situation quite clear and what the options and sentiment were as a result. WWE has 3 options: 1- Stay the course; 2- Reboot + replace Swagger; 3- Abort angle.

""I'm curious to see which way they go. I think they can salvage this and find an even better talent to build this around. I've heard Vince LOVES the concept and has been more focussed on this than 80 percent of the WWE creative since it started. He's going to likely opt for option 1 or 2. I am DYING to see what goes down.""

Another ex-WWE writer who opted to remain anonymous chimed in via email with similar thoughts. He wrote:

""That's so unfortunate. It's a good thing Zeb Coulter was getting all the heat anyways. I don't know what they do. Either keep his spot if they don't like other options or somehow they get them to wrestle sooner and put someone else in the role at Mania. Orton? Henry? Regardless it's more fuel for anyone opposed to pushing him.""

Bauer concurs that having Swagger wrestle sooner than WrestleMania would be the way to get him the World Title shot he earned by winning the Elimination Chamber

I suggested perhaps Chris Hero get brought in to replace Swagger

Bauer said: ""Hero is a good option. Bray Wyatt or Luke Harper might be more 'authentic.' Harper still isn't ready for the bright lights and Bray may not fit the criteria for the super push. Hero might be able to adjust and project that type of persona. The hillbilly beard certainly helps.

""If this was up to me, Rodriguez… maybe send out Rey &amp; Sin Cara and more of the same. They cut a promo saying 'Wrestler X' is the man behind the movement and this was all a trap. They then finally take this from being a straight-laced political stance to a dialed up wrestling warped POV on an issue and make it something controversial (instead of just a relatively sterile political perspective).

""They go for the jugular and get some real (cheap) Tennessee heat on this bad boy and Del Rio suffers a big injury. The next week Del Rio demands a fight with the new guy and the new guy refuses unless he has it at WM - the #1 media market so he can spread his message and he wants the belt. Del Rio accepts and they build him as a fighting champion - even when severely injured going into WM. That sets up a plausible finish that keeps Del Rio on good footing despite losing at WM. You could still insert Swagger as a Mr. Hughes/Diesel heater where he doesn't have to talk and can get physical and yet be completely disposable down the road.""

The other ex-writer says: ""Developmental would be the way to go if it didn't involve a World Title or WrestleMania. No way Vince gives a fresh guy that spot. They may just go forward with it and deal with his consequences after Mania and have Zeb recruit someone else who can 'get the job done'.""

In our PWTorch website and app poll, but he's on probation."" The rest - 57 percent - want him to be demoted or fired, but are split on whether to do it right away or wait until after WrestleMania. Second place was ""Demote him or fire him post-WM29"" with 34 percent, followed by ""Fire him now"" in third place at 23 percent. ",,False,self,False,t3_18xhee

1) About how skinny he is
2) How he is a ratings killer
3) How I'm just on his bandwagon because he breaks kayfabe.

I was big into WWF when I was a kid.  Hulk Hogan, Crush, Bret Hart, Shawn Micheals, the list could go on forever.  I took a break in my early teens but was pulled back in during the attitude era and I started watching some WcW as well.  Great characters and a lot of fun.

Now, I have a couple questions.

1. Why is Cena always referred to as the most ""polarizing superstar""? and has he actually won that many titles? I have done some reading on him out of the ring and he seems like a real stand up guy.  Why do people boo him and chant ""you can't wrestle"".

2. CM Punk is supposed to be a heel now right? but

3. Why are there two heavy weight belts and which is the top belt? what CM Punk has?

4. What happened to the Tag division? Prime time players have a good character and Kane and Brian could be great

5.  Are they trying to be more safe? seems like a lot of the finishers and big moves don't look as dangerous anymore.

6.  Is it worth it to check out the other wrestling companies? Are they all under the WWE banner now?

7.  Finally

I realize that is a lot to answer

Edit: Thanks to everyone who took the time to answer my many questions.  I feel much more informed now.  I wasn't aware of a lot of what people mentioned,,False,self,t5_2rau9,1347978292.0,,True

1363417943.0,1aeeul,20-1: Why CM Punk Should Beat Taker (Warning: Long),MajoraOfTime,25,10,18,"It is official. At Wrestlemania 29, I don’t think it is quite so obvious and in fact

CM Punk has been on a roll as the biggest heel in WWE today and yet seemed to be falling off the map after two losses to the Rock and a loss to John Cena on Raw. That all changed when Punk came out the following week and gained his Mania match with a fatal four way win over three former world champions. The next week, but should this be the case? After all Punk has just come off of three big “comeuppances” after his unheard of 434 days as WWE champion came to an end. Why follow up such epic success with such epic failure? Allowing Punk to end the Streak will instantly give him massive heat and solidify his spot as one of WWE’s greatest heels. His momentum will be restored and he will be able to ride this newfound accomplishment into an infinite number of possible storylines.  

In the course of explaining why Punk deserves to end it, JR has correctly been able to select the winners of every match in the past few PPV events. Whether this is JR spoiling the results of the PPVs or just guessing how WWE creative would predictably go, one thing is for sure: he knows what he is talking about. When asked about whether or not the Streak should end, JR said this:
So
Call it a no-brainer that Punk would gain immense intrigue and heat should he end the Streak, Punk has already solidified his Hall of Fame spot, but JR is not wrong in his assumption that Punk would be made an even bigger deal than he already is. Factor in JR’s words with the fact that it was reported about a month ago that Taker was “less than 50%” in regards to health and that if he had missed this year, “next year’s event would have been based around his retirement.” If a match against another 40 year old legend in Triple H, which featured Taker on the ground being beaten with a chair for a large portion of its contest, kept Taker at less than 50% for this long, imagine what a physical bout against CM Punk (one that would most likely feature many big wrestling spots) would do to him. As long as we are talking about reports, as these words were said by the “Straight Edge Superstar” back in September. What changed his mind? Could the seemingly “predictable” outcome have changed? Not to mention the fact that the late, in my opinion

Of course, he has stated his intentions of early retirement, he is a heel and heels don’t win big matches clean, he’s small, etc. Not to mention the fact that Punk is WWE’s number two guy (borderline number one, but heels aren’t number one guys) and won’t really have any major backlash from losing to a guy that even Triple H and Shawn Michaels couldn’t beat. Speaking of which, HBK is often brought up as an excuse for why *insert wrestler here* shouldn’t end the Streak. I constantly hear the excuse “If Shawn couldn’t do it, Shawn Michaels was on his way out both times that he faced Taker. Remember, he would’ve just straight up retired after ending the Streak and just like that, his career will still continue for a few more years at least

Another common argument I hear for keeping the Streak intact is because Taker vs. Cena is still a viable dream match at Wrestlemania. Well, though not well enough to really sell the feud (why not make  a big deal out of the fact that he finally defeated CM Punk in what was arguably the best match of his career to add to Cena’s explanation for why he can defeat the Rock? I digress). Given that Cena will inevitably defeat the Rock at this year’s Mania, what would be a viable story for his match against Taker next year? Cena can’t really “overcome” anything and using that tired storyline will most likely be met with groans and eye rolls from the “smart” crowd and lackluster cheers from the casual crowd. Having Taker challenge Cena could be a nice touch, but still won’t help define the rest of the story (which will devolve into the former). A Cena heel turn would make sense here, but seems like a “great white buffalo” that will never be. That leaves the outcome of a Cena-Taker match to one of two scenarios: Cena wins and shakes hands with Taker at the end of the night; or Taker wins and disappears, Streak intact. Neither one of those options seem ideal. What would Cena do after ending the Streak? Mention it once the night after while the commentators periodically remind us of the travesty that WWE created? What about if Taker wins? Same scenario. It goes nowhere. Having Punk end the Streak can help Punk ride a wave of momentum and will add to his impressive resume. Conquering Taker at Wrestlemania could open up a nice encounter between Cena and Punk the year after each man accomplishes the biggest obstacles of their careers; Cena defeating the Rock and Punk ending Taker’s Streak. A great main event for the title at Wrestlemania XXX could take place and Cena and Punk could solidify their feud as one of the greatest ever (as most great WWE feuds have been validated by a Wrestlemania main event).  

Of course, when Floyd “Money” Mayweather fights, do you watch to see him extend his winning streak, or to see if he loses? This is the drama of winning streaks. The longer the streak continues, the more danger it comes under, as momentum is sure to falter eventually. For those that wish to see a winning streak continue, the drama and tension of a challenge to that streak comes from the validity of the challenger. If it seems the streak could end, when you watch a streak be challenged, a large portion of UFC viewers must have believed Bonnar was a real threat to Silva’s title reign.  

That, Undertaker has never lost at Wrestlemania. Though stars and legends have come and gone, the Undertaker and his impressive Streak have been around during every era of WWE’s modern period. The day is slowly creeping up that the Undertaker will call it quits and retire. Like it or not, one day, the Streak will end, whether Undertaker just stops performing or if someone finally adds that first loss to his Wrestlemania record. Many argue that the Streak is just as part of Undertaker’s legacy as Paul Bearer, the urn, and the American Bad Ass angles. To those people I say; of course it is. In fact, Undertaker’s Streak will always be a part of his legacy. 20-0 is a record that will never be touched in the history of WWE and even if it becomes 20-1, the WWE’s biggest heel and hyperbolic “Best in the World

A rogue referee killed his chance, picked off by Cena. Lost again from the Shield. Then, what surprised us all. His loss at Wrestlemania. His loss at extreme rules.

This did not bode well with Ryback. Poor booking has left him down again

No, if we could turn this around, who could of Ryback feuded with from the start, or at least after Payback?

.

.

.


4-Brock Lesnar

Ryback and Brock Lesnar are similar in size and strength

Although Lesnar and Goldberg didn’t have a great match or feud with one another

Instead

Ryback is an up-and-coming WWE Superstar who, or in 2014. Brock Lesnar needs to stop wrestling other part-time wrestlers and begin to challenge current top Superstars in WWE.

Ryback as World champion would be a great fit for Brock Lesnar in 2013. You can almost see it. Ryback wins the MITB. The years second biggest event, or even someone else, but it doesn't matter, because Lesnar is competing against them.

Ryback storms down the ramp, Lesnar comes from behind, picks Ryback off his feet and delivers an F-5, setting them up for a feud and keeping Lesnar in the spot light until Wrestlemania 30, where some speculate he may face The Rock.

.

.

.

3-Sheamus

Another WWE Superstar with similar size and strength as Ryback is the former WWE and World Heavyweight champion

Sheamus has been impressive in the past with the moves he has been able to pull off on someone like Big Show

Right now

Sheamus has had difficulty rising to be the next top babyface in WWE due to his corny jokes and becoming the next silly John Cena.

A feud with Ryback could help Sheamus become popular once again with WWE fans

.

.

.

2-Daniel Bryan

Although not being the same size as Ryback, or most skilled asset at the moment. Rybacks match with Bryan was one of his best, and shows that Daniel Bryan can carry anyone though a match, and make it good.

Daniel Bryans speed could merge well with Rybacks strength. Even though it may not be a title feud

While Ryback is still green, and a title contender in the future.

.

.

.

1-Wade Barrett

Even though barrett is a good heel

For Ryback

For Barrett

Yes

It wouldn't hurt Ryback's character to do the job. Doing so would only show how well he can lose. After all

This could be a very interesting feud, Barrett could benefit from a push more than Ryback, as he is arguably the most talented of the two.

Not many so Cena although we hate him could?should be a 1 seed in the Era. Also if we as a whole hate the PG Era instead we can have a miscellaneous Region that has Mangers and other personality's from the WWE In general.

**Who is in Brock Lesnar's sights?**

After Brock Lesnar defeated Triple H at SummerSlam

**How will the Chairman Respond to Lesnar's attack?**

Certainly

With a roster of Superstars at his command, Mr. McMahon is certain to find a way to even the score.

**Is Heyman on borrowed time?**

After an incriminating video left Paul Heyman squirming about his ties to The Shield and Brad Maddox, an admitted liar, may have found a way to hide his ties to The Shield and Maddox for months, but how could he possibly talk his way out of his latest predicament with The Boss? Perhaps his upcoming appearance on ""Miz TV"" will shed some light on recent events.

**What will the Shield do next?**

With Lesnar and Heyman on The Chairman’s least favorite list, Punk was to be stripped of his title. When the black-clad group seemingly jumped The Rock, Mr. McMahon was ready to take action … until Rock demanded the match not end that way. 

When The Shield first surfaced in WWE

**Will CM Punk stick with Heyman?**

Say what you want about CM Punk, accomplish. Even WWE Champion The Rock gave The Second City Saint props for such a lengthy reign. But now that the cat is out of the bag so to speak about Heyman’s dealings with The Shield and Brad Maddox, will Punk stick with Heyman? If Punk wants to reclaim the WWE Title from The Rock at Elimination Chamber ), will he start to distance himself from Heyman … or completely cut off all ties? Punk’s next move ought to be interesting.

1353631159.0,13n7g6,How WWE could make The Miz a huge star.,BananaSheet,19,4,14,"As most of you probably know, cementing his faceturn. I've always thought that Miz would make a great face. On the mic he's one of the very best in the company, original moves.

The Miz really is the perfect underdog story. He started out as a reality TV contestant, he didn't let go of his dream. He kept on working his way up, constantly getting better and better, despite all his critics. Today he is a former WWE Champion, Intercontinental Champion, and one of the few Triple Crown winners in the company. If this isn't the perfect ""follow your dreams""-story I don't know what is. Needless to say, Miz has got everything he needs to make it as a top babyface, catchphrases

WWE TLC is coming up and The Big Show, the former Champion, who lost to Big Show at Survivor Series in a controversial way. On an episode of Smackdown, Sheamus will come out and ask for a rematch, but before he can get an answer he is interrupted... By Wade Barrett. Barrett tells Sheamus that if anyone deserves a title shot it's him. This brings out another man, Randy Orton. Orton thinks that he's been out of the title picture for way too long, and that it now is his time to shine. Suddenly ""AWESOME!"" is heard throughout the arena and The Miz comes out. Miz says that out of all the guys in the ring

Miz wins this Fatal Fourway. He pins Wade Barrett after the Big Show had interfered and viciously attacked everyone but him. The following weeks Big Show will explain that the only reason he let Miz go was because he knew that out of those four men, and that he simply picked the opponnent that required the less effort.

TLC comes around and Big Show defends his title against The Miz in a TLC match. The previous weeks more and more pressure has been building on The Miz. Will he be able to do the impossible, ladders and chairs, before easily climbing up the ladder and retaining his title. Miz will be so badly beaten that he will be out with injuries for the rest of the year.

Then, who was denied his rematch last month, is again back in the title picture and will try to win back the World Heavyweight Championship in a Last Man Standing match. After putting on an amazing fight though, he ends up not victorious. The Big Show is still champion.

Then the Royal Rumble match is up. This match will feature a lot of big names, with only a couple of entrants left. Then, at the 29 mark, something unbelievable happens. A sudden voice yelling ""AWESOME!"" is heard throughout the arena and out comes Miz, looking to be back at 100%. Miz will then go on to eliminate the rest of the competitiors in the ring, before finally turning to the ramp for the final entrant. That entrant is Sheamus.

Sheamus, before Sheamus eventually gets Miz on the apron(similar to him and Jericho from last year). Sheamus will go for the Brogue Kick and Miz will duck in the last second, causing Sheamus to trip over the top rope and down to the floor. That is it, and The Miz has won the Royal Rumble. He will get a free Championship Match of his choosing at Wrestlemania, and Miz, without a doubt, chooses The World heavyweight Championship.

The weeks go by as The Big Show keeps embarassing The Miz. He shows footage from their match at TLC, let alone in the biggest wrestling company in the world. Eventually Big Show will go on to Elimination Chamber, where he will defend his title against Randy Orton, Sheamus, Wade Barrett, Kofi Kingston and Dolph Ziggler. Big Show will win this match, truly proving his dominance and showing that he will never lose that championship. Then, The Miz will come out on the ramp

Miz, and he has worked his ass off for years and years to get to where he is today. ""At Wrestlemania 29 it is you and me, big man!"" Miz will say, before announcing that nothing will stand in his way. He will become World Heavyweight Champion. He will fulfill his boyhood dream and there is nothing Big Show can do to stop it.

The following weeks leading up to Wrestlemania the rivalry between Miz and Show will continue to heat up

At Wrestlemania The Big Show and The Miz will have an amazing back-and-forth bout, before performing a top rope Scull Crushing Finale on him and pinning him. The pin will be a successful one and Miz will be the new World Heavyweight Champion, after winning the biggest match of his life.

The Miz, lifts the championship up in the air and gets an eroptous roar from the crowd. Right at this moment Dolph Ziggler suddenly appears from behind, hits Miz in the back of the head with the Money in The Bank briefcase, drags him to the ring and cashes in his contract.

Miz will eventually get to his feet and Dolph will hit him with the Zig Zag. 1, Miz will get to the ropes, forcing the break. Dolph will look absolutely infuriated, but as Miz struggles to get to his feet Dolph jumps up and delivers a second Zig Zag, finally earning him the pinfall.

This will spark the start of a new feud between The Miz and Dolph Ziggler, and keeps on coming back, even after suffering several serious injuries. It will lead to monster heat for both Big Show and Dolph Ziggler and the WWE will have created a new megastar in The Miz.

1365438771.0,1bxby3,My take on Wrestlemania XXIX,petenuts,17,2,22,"***Wade Barret vs The Miz*** 

Match was pretty good

***Orton/Big Show/Sheamus vs The Shield***  

This was pretty predictable

***Mark Henry vs Ryback***

What was the point of having Henry beat Ryback? At this point his ""feed me more"" catchphrase is pretty much dead. Apparently Henry was too big of a meal for him.

***Ziggler/Big E vs Hell No***

Why the hell is Ziggler jobbing again? Mr. Money in the bank shouldn't really be losing clean matches after matches

***Fandango vs Jericho***

It was pretty obvious that Jericho carried Fandango through this

***ADR vs Swagger***

I predicted Swagger getting the win but was shocked at ADR retaining. Not sure how this will go on since WWE hyped up Swagger's ""America"" so hard the past few weeks with promos. I was also certain that Swagger would attack ADR after his loss ending up with Ziggler strolling down the ramp and cashing in

***The Undertaker vs CM Punk***

This was by far the best match of the card. Taker pulls it off again and CM Punks shows that he is indeed ""the best in the world"". Despite having huge shoes to fill

***HHH vs Lesnar***

Despite coming out covered in semen, you could see him bleeding out the nose after the match: how painful. It was awesome seeing both of them locking Kimura's on each other and you could see it on Lesnar's face how bad it was; great acting! The crowd however, seems to be sapped of energy due to the match before with Taker and Punk. It was also interesting to see how willing HHH was to put his body on the line, despite being rich as fuck. 

***Cena vs The Rock***

""Once in a Lifetime: The rematch"" it should be named. It can't get anymore predictable than this. Rock has to film a movie -&gt; drops title to super cena. ""The champ is here"", can the Rock Bottom even be considered a finisher anymore?

What we know since Royal Rumble:

* CM Punk vs The Rock at Elimination Chamber for the title.
* The Rock (or possibly but not likely Punk) vs Cena at WM for the title.

(Non Title Storyline)

* On Raw
* On Smackdown
* Heyman is seemingly behind The Shield and/or who they attack.
* Bork came back for a little WM action.

So what role do you think The Shield, CM Punk, Heyman, Bork or even Taker have for WM?

Will we see Taker vs Punk or Taker vs Bork? [Maybe  Bork is involved with Rock &amp; Cena?](http://cdn1.sbnation.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/6773443/wrestlemania_29_poster.0_standard_352.0.jpg).

WWE is well known for foreshadowing the future so my prediction is that John Cena will have another first. A more controversial first. I believe John Cena will be the first superstar to cash in money in the bank and not become WWE champion. The dirt sheets have been hyping the new WWE championship title that is supposed to debut on the 1000th raw. The spinner belt represents John Cena more than anything else. Some how cena could be screwed out of his match we have seen that before. And CM Punk will usher in a solidified spot at the top possibly losing to big show in a feud where the underdog punk is on a quest to regain his WWE title. The screw job would then set up the next Cena fued with who ever causes him to lose his contracted bout. Maybe even by the hand of his last wrestlemania opponent the Rock. Just my thoughts,self,
