-------------

This post is aimed to look at a few questions that some people may be asking themselves.  One of the things a famous children's rights expert told me once that has stuck with me since is that (almost) everyone needs a niche

a) make an impact and

b) get an actual job where you earn actual money AND do what you actually like

For most large non-profits, experience (intern or job).  That's why, when looking for internships, you should be very sure you like that sector because it's very likely going to influence the next 3-5 years of your working life - *at least*.

As I'm still studying at the moment, very motivating as in Austria studies can take a long time (you make your own timetable and basically have 5 years to do a bachelor without paying school fees, so people often don't feel pressured to finish. Me included).

Having said that: I'm interested in your niche. What is your specialisation? Are you a social entrepreneur providing innovative solutions to expensive problems?  What does your work entail?

I'd be interested to get a little discussion going in a subreddit that often seems to be merely a platform for bloggers and new nonprofits advertising their sites.

When I arrived, laying on her stomach on the floor, desperately digging with her fingers under the door. When she noticed me, she told me she'd put the wrong grant under the door, and now she couldn't get it back, because it was lost among all the others.

Understand, they never answer the phone, and rarely return voicemail. Last year, they never even sent us a response on our grant. I've tried to call/email probably 25 times since I started this job, just to get confirmation that we were rejected, and never reached anyone.

So, after ten minutes, red-faced and looking like tears were on the way, she gave up and moved aside. I gently slid mine under the door to one side, hoping not to make her situation worse by pushing hers deeper into the office, and gave her my best advice considering the situation -- slide the correct one under the door, and just try to call them as soon as possible tomorrow. I left then, back on her hands and knees

I've never seen such desperation in someone's face, if she's going to get fired, if this was her last chance. I'll never know any of that. I do know this, though: I'll never forget that lady as long as I live, and that haunted look in her eyes, like she had nothing left.",,self,,

A beautiful, W3C compliant and you will have the ability to update it when you like. I will give you a few different designs to choose from once I have understood what you want and other sites you like the feel of.

I will also gift the chosen charity a domain for one year (if they don't already own one) and if they like I can setup all their email accounts

Ideally I want a charity that knows what they want as I don't have time to go too deep into the conceptualisation stages. If you know what you want on your site and you know what sites you like the look of

List details of your charity here. I will select a winner and I will be biased towards a charity that is aligned with my personal values ;)

I have worked for a very small non-profit (4 full time employees) for 8+ years.  We work with children and reach the lives of almost 500 kids each year.  I like what I do but sometimes feel unsupported.  

I personally run all of our intramural sports leagues and am ultimately responsible for the success of them.  I do many other things as well for my organization

Basically I'm writing this because I am irritated with the rest of the professional staff.  I am constantly one of the only people cleaning up our center at the end of the day (50 or so kids in our building daily and we don't have a custodial budget).  This is not my primary job but I do what I can to help out.  

In the 1.5 years I've been in my position running our sports leagues the rest of the professional staff have come to 3 of my events (I should mention that for 10 months of the year I typically have games Monday through Thursday every week).  One person came to watch a couple of volleyball games.  Another came to watch one volleyball game (we run 3-4 a night) and the only other time any of the professional staff have come to anything I do

Basically the brainstorming sessions I’ve had with folks so far interested in helping have been productive. A lot of people have described how they envision Weedit.Org operating. Now it’s time to begin the real work developing the bylaws

I’d like to have something in place for the organization by the end of November. Then later on we can file for tax exempt status with the IRS

The main goals of the organization will be educating the general public regarding cannabis cultures (non-stereotypical) and the general safety of cannabis. We should spread these ideas using traditional and modern social media organizing into local branches and ‘microbranches’ in a Reddit sort of way. This movement was empowered by the community power of Reddit. I’d like the organization to be spread wide and far yet also be local and accessible. I think we can leverage the power of the Trees community and the Internet to really make a difference for the campaigns to re-legalize cannabis in Washington State in 2011 and California

I am a 21 year old who is taking a year off volunteering in a hospital in Vietnam prior to med school. I have spent the last 2 months working in the local ICU and literally seen patients die every single day or going home to die around loved ones. 

The most shocking part about it is that a good portion of those patients died or went home to die because they did not have enough money to pay for medications. I see their families borrowing money
It cost on average $100/day to be treated in the ICU

Right now, to start a 501(c)(3) non profit organization takes at least a year. How do I raise money until then? How do I show people it is a legitimate cause and not a scam? I am also thinking that I can have my family matching whatever I collect (probably need to figure out what their limit is). I also realize that giving money away might not be as efficient as micro-lending or investing in education, but people are dying because they don't have enough to pay their bills.

I'm in charge of finding corporate funding for a philanthropy, but there's almost TOO much potential. I don't know how or where to start, and I've been writing my ass off for the past three or four months and still nothing. I haven't given up or anything, but with every rejection that rolls in it seems more and more impossible to get funding from anyone.

I know that grant writing is all about patience and perseverance, and the other was a one-time donation, so now I'm just really scared. On top of that, the holidays are making it hard for me to make headway with the companies. 

I guess it's more that I'm afraid of letting everyone down than us needing it - it'll be a setback but we won't have to close our doors. But this organization is really

So I'm looking to anyone out there that has any experience in the field. I already went through the huge databases and handpicked grants that sounded like they suited us. I've called countless businesses and foundations, it suddenly seems wildly inefficient and I have second thoughts.

Literally ANY input is helpful at this point. Like I said, but if you need more specifics just ask.

I built 5mf with the idea of creating a platform for doing product-based fundraising

But after talking with several NPs in my area

So instead of t-shirts or coffee mugs, say $30. You could add any number of other ""items"" that correlated to your organization, and donors would then pick their items and quantity, and complete the ""checkout"" process.  

So instead of handing over money via a vanilla PayPal donation form, to the donation process. 

My big question now is what to call these virtual products. I want to quickly communicate this notion to NP leaders without having to write two paragraphs

Hello

According to the U.S. Department of Justice,000 children internationally.

Human trafficking, anywhere, and at any time. I was once one of these children.  Like so many other victims my abusers were never arrested for their crimes.  I felt as if no one loved me or cared about what happened to me.

It has taken me many years to come to terms with the horrendous abuse I experienced as a child. Now

Every day

With your help

The Wayne Foundation's vision is for a world without child slavery. Our mission is to provide young women who have fallen victim to commercial sexual exploitation and domestic trafficking with a means of leaving the sex industry for good. The Wayne Foundation is committed to fighting human trafficking

It is our intent to stop commercial sex exploitation within the United States through direct victim assistance

**Where you come in**

Every cent of profit made from this bundle will go directly to The Wayne Foundation to help them accomplish this mission. Not only will you get some great RPG and board game products

You can listen to an amazing interview with Jamie Walton, with Kevin's help, decided to start the Wayne Foundation. Here's part one and part two.
