To the mom who's breastfeeding: Way to go! It really is an amazing gift to give your baby

To the mom who's formula feeding: Isn't science amazing? To think there was a time when a baby with a mother who couldn't produce enough would suffer

To the cloth diapering mom: Fluffy bums are the cutest

To the disposable diapering mom: Damn those things hold a lot

To the mom who stays home: I can imagine it isn't easy doing what you do

To the mom who works: It's wonderful that you're sticking to your career

To the mom who had to feed her kids from the drive thru all week because you're too worn out to cook or go grocery shopping: You're feeding your kids

To the mom who gave her kids a homecooked breakfast lunch and dinner for the past week: Excellent! Good nutrition is important

To the mom with the kids who are sitting quietly and using their manners in the fancy restaurant: Kudos

To the mom with the toddler having a meltdown in the cereal aisle: they always seem to pick the most embarrassing places to lose their minds don't they? We've all been through it. You're a good mom.

It feels right. I follow my instincts. I love having her snuggled next to me. I never worry if she's breathing, barely wakes me up. And tonight as she lay next to me nursing, I held her little hand, feeling the smooth skin and tiny fingers. This is my daughter. I made her. She came from me. I love her more than life itself and I'm going to cherish these moments. She won't be a baby forever. Someday she will be in her own room. Someday she won't live in my house. Someday she may be cuddled next to her little one. And I will miss her, but I will be proud of her. But tonight she is all mine, and I'm so thankful I am her world.

That's not who I am. 

I am not lithe. My body is comfy. It's warm and soft

There are wrinkles on it
My hands are rough and strong.
These are all good things.

I was giving Ainslie her nightly bath and winding down from the day with her. She loves being in her tub and just relaxing in the warm water. I only ever fill her little tub up with an inch or two of water

She put her face in the water and pulled it back out more quickly than I could react. Her mouth was closed the whole time and for a split second I thought she was okay. She must have breathed in the water through her nose because within seconds she turned red and started flailing her arms and legs.

Luckily, she spit out the water and started to cry. From the moment she inhaled the water to when she spit it out, only about 45 seconds had passed. It was honestly the scariest 45 seconds of my life.

I cried so hard and held her extra close for the rest of the night. I can't even tell you how many times I checked on her while she was sleeping last night. If I hadn't been right there

Remember to always bring everything you need into the bathroom with you. Once the baby is in the bath, but you can't bring your baby back if the worst were to happen. The phone and the doorbell are also not important when your baby is in the bath, that person can wait. I hope none of you ever have to experience what I did last night.",,False,,t5_2u06v,,http://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/18731p/this_may_come_off_as_a_little_psay/

I have never seen a happier baby in my life than my son has been the last few days: he suddenly discovered cooing and babbling and just smiles at me all day long. He's even been going down for naps in his swing awake without a sound (WHAT? WHO IS THIS BABY!?). We haven't mastered the putting-down-awake-in-crib-at-night yet, which is easy to deal with because it's predictable. 

I just wanted to give a happy update because I've read a few posts in the last week or so from people with babies about my son's age expressing similar exasperation and I just wanted to share a ""Holy wow, but it's just such a huge difference that even though he was up 6 times last night, I don't even care.

While we are always (usually?) happy for these ladies

With my daughter I was able to get into a normalish size soon after, I gained 5 pounds while breastfeeding (and this was eating insanely well!) Since stopping the breastfeeding I've been able to find a diet that works with my body and ever so slowly I'm seeing little bits of ""normal"" again.

Don't lose hope. Not everyone recovers overnight, and that is okay. I'll probably be still fighting with weight in another 6 months. Give yourself permission to love your body. You're so fantastically crafty you made a person. Celebrate that no matter what you look like. Take pictures with your baby where your chin has its own chin because you're smooshing those cheeks with kisses. Take the awkward video where your arm looks bigger than your baby and you can absolutely see your tummy. Even if you don't like how you look now, you might and probably will eventually look different, and if nothing else you can look back and say ""look how far I've come!"" And if you don't ever change, at least you won't kick yourself ten years from now for not having captured these wonderful memories.

I'll stop being sappy now. I just wanted to share my happiness and a dose of encouragement with you all. Thank you for all the awesome stories and pictures you post! Keep the smiles coming :)

I stumble into the nursery and both my breasts are engorged and slightly leaky.  I walk over to my baby and he is on his back grinning and he begins kicking his arms and legs because he is so happy to see me.

I pick him up and take him over to the mattress in the corner of his room.  He nurses vigorously and drains my breast in about 5 minutes.  We stop only once to burp

I love her. She's a great kid. Way better than the typical 15yo. The 'problem' is that when she's with us, she's really stuck to me. She saves shows for me to watch so we can see them together. She wants to talk about her week at school. She wants to go anywhere I go. Etc. 
So, I've found myself dreading the weekend. My SO is home as well. They all want my attention. They all make more mess. And I'm tired. However, I always really make an effort. I don't want my stepdaughter to resent her sister. I do love her. And I feel like as a parent, I just need to suck it up and deal.

But I'm serious! The porn industry can spend millions of dollars manufacturing a [rubber vagina](http://www.amazon.com/Fleshlight-Vibro-Touch-Pussy-Masturbator/dp/B009P5NA6M/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1359303997&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=fleshlight) but my baby has to make do with with this rinky-dink plastic bullshit? Don't companies know that the only thing people spend more money on than porn is their children?

I would really pay out of the nose for a pacifier that would calm my baby down the way my boob does. Maybe throw some expressed breastmilk in that bitch so I can actually get some sleep. 

Maybe if we tell perverts that they can buy two and titty-bang them manufacturers would get on this faster.

I had a 12 month maternity leave

I had a nasty difficult labor and an emergency C-section.  My husband stepped up on baby's very first day

Our baby was seriously fussy, and just walk.  He would let me sleep until baby needed feeding, then would send me back to bed.  When we figured out that I had to cut dairy, beef, gluten, nuts, soy, he quit eating those things in solidarity.  He learned how to cook things I could eat.  He spent hours reading labels in grocery stores with me to figure out what might be okay.  He let me whine endlessly about how tough it was to not have milk chocolate.  

Now that I'm back to work, diapering, nap-inducing, and supervising of our son while I'm gone, and 50% (or more) of all of the above when I'm home.  He gets out of bed as soon as the baby cries, and takes him to a different room to soothe him back to sleep, unless he's hungry.  If baby needs to eat, then takes him back to his crib.  

The one thing I do 100% of is baths.  Oh, except when baby needs to eat.  On a day-to-day basis, my husband sneaks in his video game time during naps, but not normally until after he's done the dishes, cleaned the kitchen, run a load of laundry, and figured out what will be for supper.  The house is not immaculate or anything

Oh, and Hubby's been doing all of the chores this week because I've been sick with a cold.  Normally, he does mornings and I do evenings.

Let me start by saying that my husband loves our son and tries to be a good dad. Now...

I feel like my husband hates me

Things were great between us at the hospital, among other minor offenses). He also decreed that he should not (and would not) get up with the baby during the night (I ebf so he would have just been changing diapers anyways) because he was the only one who worked and needed his sleep. Ok, I can see that I guess... so I've been the only one to get up during the night ever since our second night home. Anytime I ever speak of being tired he says things like ""I don't know why, it's not like you do anything but sit around and eat all day."" He tells me all the time that he feels like it is my job to take care of our son and all of the household chores because I don't work during the day and 'it's not that hard to watch a baby and get stuff done at the same time.' He grills me about what chores I did during the day, and when I haven't been productive enough he gets irritated. When he comes home he plays with the baby a little, talks at me about his day at work (not really to me, as he doesn't give me a chance to respond) for about an hour, eats, he'll usually just follow me around demanding to have ""his son"" until I hand him to him. He's also made it a point to tell me that if I divorce him I would never get rid of him because he wont leave me alone until he has his son. I haven't even spoken of divorce since he brought it up when I was pregnant

He also reminds me almost daily that we are pathetically broke because we live on one income. He spends all of his spare time either with his friend or window shopping for motorcycles/parts online, am still driving the same car I had 13 years ago (with no complaint until now... a 2 door 96 toyota is a bit small for a family car). I would also like to say that while we don't have a lot of extra cash, we are always able to cover our living expenses just fine.

In addition to this he also seems to hate sharing with me. I only work 5 hours a week from home right now because I have had trouble finding a job that will pay for childcare and gas with any money left over, saying that he has to make sure the bills are paid before he can just give me money. Yes, I have had to learn to be VERY good at stretching a dollar. I've cut out almost all driving -- only leaving the house to go to the store or to appointments. I only shop at discount food stores. I haven't bought clothes since before I got pregnant (at 30lbs heavier than I used to be I'm literally stuffing myself into my old clothes), I've stopped wearing make up since I can't afford to replace it, and I never ask him to give me money for anything recreational. I even turned down going on vacation with my family because he didn't think it was fair that I would use my meager earnings on just myself. Yet anytime I ask him for grocery money he lectures me about how he can't afford to give me money, always reminding me the HE is the only one who is earning income. And he repeatedly brings up that I'm at home all day long and therefore must be eating up all the food all day.

There are other things too -- like that we haven't slept together since before I had the baby (maybe tmi?). He's really grabby and will slap my ass or throw me down on the bed during the day, right. I've just been up all night with the baby, but sure honey! He also told me last weekend that ""I know frank will always be my friend, but you may not always be my wife. That's why I'm trying to make him a priority."" Wtf? Shouldn't that be the other way around? Then tonight he said (not for the first time) that if it weren't for me he could make the week's worth of food that I buy stretch for a month. I know I'm a little heavier than I was, but geez. For the record, I don't eat all day. I have a bowl of cereal for breakfast, and usually fruit and a handful of peanuts for lunch, but that's it.

I just don't know what to do. I'm not sure what I've done to make him think I'm such a lazy, do his laundry, cook dinner every night, and take good care of our son. I have tried to express that I think it would be more cost effective for me to be a stay at home mom for now, and that I want to take care of our baby, not have someone else do it. I don't think it makes me lazy or a bad person that I want to be with my baby, but I just can't get my husband to understand. I'm so tired of constantly being reminded of how much I suck, but when it comes to me it's another story. I try not to let it get to me

Not sure what I'm expecting anyone to do or say... I just needed to get it off my chest. Hopefully I can gain some perspective from this. Anyone else experience something like this? Will it get better? Am I just not seeing what I'm doing wrong?

tl;dr My husband used to like me

Truncus Arteriosus. A normal heart has two arteries; the aorta which brings blood from the heart to the body, there is only one artery attached to the heart, the aorta, and there are two pulmonary branches stemming from the aorta, giving it the appearance of a tree. In addition to this, my daughter's bottom ventricles or chambers are not connected, which causes a large hole. 

This is congenital. So at the moment her heart started developing, it should have been glaringly obvious.

My baby will have open heart surgery this week. She will have a scar for the rest of her life. I can't even think about the risk of the surgery because she just HAS to make it. I'm scared

I changed her out of her sleeper, a pink owl footie that is in heavy rotation on account of it's miraculous fit. I put her in a new sleeper, an act of optimism that she would head back to sleep after the stimulation of being hosed off and mama's bleak cries of ""holy shit, that's a lot of shit!"" 

Now unfortunately this new sleeper fits her for length, which is, admittedly, hilarious to watch, but frustrating for the baby and has led to distress calls being piped throughout the house as she rolls around with her feet trapped. 

I used to solve this by putting a pair of socks on over the feet of the sleeper

Queue the sleep-deprived Macgyvering that has brought me here to share with you ladies - I cut the ankle bands off a pair of socks that no longer fit the length of her foot and slipped the bands up over her feet around the ankles to hold the sleeper feet in place - no bulk

Now maybe I am a.) just a total idiot for not figuring something like this out earlier and b.) thinking it's worth sharing or c.) it's 5am and fuck if I know what I am doing and I will look at her sad little ankle bands at a more civilized hour and wonder what the hell I was thinking.

But recently she has discovered how to pull up and it's back to being hellish to get her to sleep. It's like she dreads bedtime now and will start flipping out right after her bath. Last night she started screaming as soon as I sat her down on the floor still wrapped up in her towel. It took 20 minutes to wrestle her diaper and PJs on to her. She was red-faced and just screaming angrily with all her might. I tried everything to calm her down and nothing was working. So I gave in and nursed her and she almost immediately fell asleep in my arms. I put her down in her crib

She started crying and I left the room. Within a few minutes, I'm listening to the guitar and it's just awful. Not only is the neighbour being noisy, but they can't even play the guitar! As I continue to mentally ridicule my neighbour's lack of musical talent, I realise that the noise is actually coming from inside my apartment.

I was wondering if there's any other women creeping around here who gave their baby up for adoption. I had my daughter on June 9th (which coincided with a particularly terrible wildfire in the hills behind my town) and her parents took her home on the 10th from the hospital. They were present for her birth (well, and she is so beautiful. I can't even begin to say how proud I am of her, and of how well she and her parents are all doing together. They are a happy little family and she's getting love from all sides of the situation. There has been some lingering emotional aftermath for me (What kind of terrible woman gives her child away??) But I'm comfortable with my decision and am trying not to beat myself up over it too much, I know it was the right thing to do.

We've flown economy

Been through Geneva, Washington-Dulles, Raleigh-Durham, Greensboro, and Tampa airports with baby. Edit: most intense part was 5 flights in 4 days, including 1 trans-Atlantic flight.

Some of my tips include:

- bring your boppy on board

- check how much more expensive business class is. Sometimes it is outrageous

- ask at the gate if there is a free seat for your car seat

- bring changes of clothes for you and several for baby

- bring more diapers and food than you need (we had a flight canceled and an overnight where we weren't sure to get our checked luggage although we did in the end)

- bring some dish soap to wash up spoons and such once baby is old enough.  I brought mine in a spare bottle and ""milked"" the bottle since I didn't have a spare squeeze bottle.  It leaked a little

""It will change your life

""I know, no more spontaneous vacations.""

But that is not what I meant at all. I look at my daughter

I want to tell her that the physical wounds of child bearing will heal

I consider warning her that she will never again read a newspaper without asking

That when she sees pictures of starving children

I look at her carefully manicured nails and stylish suit and think that no matter how sophisticated she is

I feel that I should warn her that no matter how many years she has invested in her career
baby's sweet smell. She will have to use every ounce of discipline to keep from running home

I want my daughter to know that every day decisions will no longer be routine. That a five year old boy's desire to go to the men's room rather than the women's at McDonald's will become a major dilemma. That right there
children

However decisive she may be at the office

Looking at my attractive daughter

That her life, but will also begin to hope for more years, not to accomplish her own dreams, but to watch her child accomplish theirs.

I want her to know that a cesarean scar or shiny stretch marks will become badges of honor.

My daughter's relationship with her husband will change

I wish she could understand how much more you can love a man who is careful to powder the baby or who never hesitates to play with his child.

I think she should know that she will fall in love with him again for reasons she would now find very unromantic.

I wish my daughter could sense the bond she will feel with women throughout history who have tried to stop war

I want to describe to my daughter the exhilaration of seeing your child learn to ride a bike.

I want to capture for her the belly laugh of a baby who is touching the soft fur of a dog or cat for the first time.

I want her to taste the joy that is so real it actually hurts.

My daughter's quizzical look makes me realize that tears have formed in my eyes. ""You'll never regret it, and for me, and for all the mere mortal women who stumble their way into this most wonderful of callings.
Please share this with a Mom that you know or all of your girlfriends who may someday be Moms. May you always have in your arms the one who is in your heart.""

Last Monday I woke up from my nap to find Zahara burning hot and lethargic.  I took her temp which was 101 and we immediately took her to the hospital.

I can't even describe how panicked I was as the world around me moved at snails pace as I held my little lifeless child.  Everything seemed to take forever.

We had to watch everything.  My mom and I recorded times and medicines that were given to her, they refused to give her meds when she SHOULD have gotten meds.  

They had equipment to regulate how much antibiotics were going into her IV but after punching a bunch of random buttons the nurse said ""it's not working"" and we used a manual drip.  I was thankful for this

The mosquitos were awful.  We were all covered in bites and had to ask 5 times for mosquito nets in which they just replied ""they're coming soon"".  If I have to hear ""soon"" to question again in my life I will lose it.

Day after day she seemed to get better.  Her white blood cell count was high indicating she had some kind of infection.  The last night I started having violent shakes/chills.  It really scared me and there seemed to be no doctors anywhere.  We had spent all our cash on the deposit to admit Zahara to the ward and the private room so I couldn't go to urgent care.

I got up and walked to Urgent care hoping to find someone that will at least look at my incision to see if it is infected thus giving me the shakes/chills/fever.

I was pretty much laughed at by the nurse and as I was walking out in tears a woman in her early 20's asked me what's wrong.  I explained my baby is admitted in the ward

The next day my doctor had me tested for malaria

Upon thinking about how bad my experience was, to seeing your child sick and to not know what questions to ask or what you should be doing.  I plan on talking with our non profit board about comforting/providing food/toys to parents and children at the government hospitals.  That little conversation and kindness that doctor showed me for FREE was what I needed to calm my nerves down.

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/3idIi) are some pictures from the hospital.  The nets are on both of our beds

You can also see the IV med machine standing by completely useless next to her bed.  It is amazing how much equipment they are not trained on or works

On a sad note

I'm so thankful my mom is here.  I don't think I could have handled the issues with the nurses and the meds on my own.  

Anyway

I thought about how I couldn't handle this life now that the circumstances have changed then I watched [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWHJ6-YhSYQ) video and it reminded me why I'm here.  Even if you are not religious in anyway it should help provide a little empathy to where I'm coming from.

What a road ladies :)

i'm a new mom and i always knew i would breastfeed. it was literally one of the only things i absolutely had my heart set on regarding my son's infant-hood. i, **""no matter how hard it might be, we'll get through it.""** fast forward 7 weeks into my son's life and i am now only pumping and supplementing with ~ 8 ounces of formula a day (due to supply and baby tummy issues). 

my baby is a ferocious eater and has a tongue-tie. once he had his first bottle around 3 weeks he went on a full boob strike, i threw in the towel. 

the point of this story is so many times during the past month i have cried - to my husband, while feeding him with a bottle. a large reason for this is the loss of something that was so important to me, but another part has to do with me feeling like a failure. and i've slowly come to understand how wrong this is! 

such a huge emphasis is placed on the importance of breastfeeding in our culture currently, ""it might be hard, but you CAN do it"". and though i get that these statements are meant to be encouraging (and may help the majority of the time) in cases like mine they only make a mother feel shittier. and that sucks. 

so if you know someone struggling with BFing at all, formula feeding or mixing it up!

I am late to the game here and there were too many comments to read through them all but was filled in on how nasty things got.

Here's the deal ladies and gents.. this community was created for /r/babybump mama's to continue on together after pregnancy and share our continued support

I see less and less of the mama's I was pregnant with and more unknowns (bound to happy as more ladies pop and join us).  But I also see more and more of this need to be aggressive and rude.  Of course we can only do so much to keep the peace and can't control what you say or do but

STOP WITH THE HATE ON HERE!!  If you don't like something or have nothing kind to say

**T - is it true?**
**H - is it helpful?**
**I - is it inspiring?**
**N - is it necessary?**
**K - is it kind?**

If you cannot follow these 5 simple things to reply to any post on here than you shouldn't be replying to it.  Simple as that.

Thank you and carry on with the happy and cute babies and rants and question threads and all the other great things about this sub but leave your drama and nasty words behind.  :)",,t5_2u06v,False,labor,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1341kx/this_community_used_to_be_about_support/

I went to work at 2 yesterday. Left kiddo here with the MIL and BIL (15): SO would be home at 430 to take over. He said he was going to make them dinner, I discover that I'm working a turnaround. Meaning I'm working until 11pm, and need to be back at work at 9am the next (this) morning. I text SO this.

I get home at 1115 and another friend is in my living room. Baby's asleep. I shove food in my face, one more time, guess who gets to wake up? I'm running on 4 hours of sleep and I have to go to work in 3 hours. Zero chance of a nap. As it stands, baby is pretty much whining nonstop. Won't chew, won't sleep, won't eat. Just crying. I don't know when I'm going to freaking get a shower. All three men are sleeping and offering zero assistance.

And, a stove where all four burners are occupied by dirty pots and pans, an overflowing trash can, food debris on the floor, and even more used dishes/cutting boards/crap on every single counter. I have no room to make breakfast or do anything in there. In 9 hours, they managed to take an out-of-a-magazine kitchen and transform it into that of a bachelor who hasn't cleaned in a week. 

I'm fucking done. I'm ready to just set the baby in bed next to my SO, I have to put off *basic essentials* like using the bathroom, taking a shower, or eating, because he's too fucking occupied getting his 10 hours of sleep or hanging with the bros. Oh, sure, when I get ultra-pissed off he notices, I don't get an ounce of help. I left this place clean,,False

Overreacting?",Munchees,54,9,40,"So my father was visiting today and pretty much berated me on my ""mommy issues"". IE- I was vocally adamant that I did NOT want my stepmother to take Adrienne to Walmart, I want my daughter to get SIDS and die

After the verbal spew-fest, and I was uncomfortable with the idea until I spoke to Adrienne's pediatrician about it. After conferring with the pediatrician, I was told to not allow spinal adjustments until at least 6 months if I was adamant about it. If I wasn't, she recommended not getting her adjusted until she started school. I told my grandfather that I appreciated his offer, but would pass until a later time.

My stepmom, obviously, because baby chiropractors do NOT adjust this way. And I feel as if she overstepped some serious boundaries. This is my child, and my call. If they want to adjust infants, I suggest they have more children.

The conversation with my father ended up in an argument and me asking him to leave. I have yet to approach my stepmother on this

Outside perspectives

EDIT: Thanks you all for your responses. It's nice to know it's not just the hormones raging. I have called my stepmom, regardless of my feelings on the matter. Until further notice, she is welcome to come visit Adrienne with SO or I present, as is my father, but I will not be leaving them alone with her. My parents are unhappy, but I'm sticking to my guns. I could get over the WalMart thing, but this is just another level of stepping on toes. They have to accept that I'm the parent here,,1353130324.0,t3_13brom

I gave birth to my beautiful son 13 days ago

The first week my SO's mom was here

My mom has been nothing but annoying as all hell. She works full time and constantly complains to me about how ""unfair it is that she's only seen HER baby (my son) four times so far."" Now we have no car, she brought us groceries, took us shopping. None of those things happened. It's just frustrating and annoying to hear about her constant lies about my family to make herself the center of attention to look good when in reality she hasn't done ANYTHING.

Whatever, but she insists on re doing everything, which would be helpful if she didn't ask my questions every ten minutes. She now wants to re-arrange the baby's room. NO NO NO NO NO. That is MY project and I spent a lot of time and work on his room. And I love it. But she insists. She wants to change him and it's no help because I constantly have to do it. She doesn't wipe underneath his balls (she had three girls) and last time put the diaper on super loose and he pooped and it went out of his diaper and all over his clothes and blanket. 

On top of all of this me and my fiance are sick

Between breastfeeding every two hours, my stitches hurt, dealing with all of the people that want to see my baby and do things their way and not listening to me, my SO not helping as much (it's now 1:30 and he's still sleeping but I shouldn't complain because he has been great), and my baby only wanting to be held by me, I feel like I'm loosing it here. 

Jeremy's usually totally fine. But he'll only fall asleep in my arms and he screams and screams and only gets soothed if I hold him. This turns our feedings into 90 minute long sessions of him crying everytime I put him down and then pooping his diaper the second I put him down

I'm exhausted. I'm tired. I feel like crap. And people keep telling me I can't do this, and I do not think it was a mistake. I do know what I'm doing, I love him more than anything, I'm just tired right now. I'm still doing everything right and trying my hardest I'm just stressed and tired.

As you know if you read my previous post

My friend Heidi that is here trying to adopt an abandoned child lost all her cash that we had stored away for her in our room.  

I feel so vulnerable.  Cashion said not to worry because we are protected better at night with a guard and a busy road near by but I still feel sick to my stomach.  I feel like I can't get a break from anxiety, to our dog being poisoned, to a thief breaking in and stealing our money.  I guess it could have been worse, they didn't take the computers or my camera or my mom's iphone that was near by.  

Heidi is on her way back from the orphanage.  I feel knots brewing knowing how many bumps she has had along the way and to have this problem on top of it. 

I don't want to post anything on facebook and freak out my family or hers (her mom is on my facebook and gets worried easy).  But I had to let it out.  Cashion isn't very comforting because this is a part of life to him.  He grew up with the constant threat of thieves.  I guess I just need to him to say WHAT THE HELL and freak out once and a while.  Maybe that isn't any better.

The fact that we had everything locked and someone still got in is making me feel the most scared.  I have a daughter now.  This is most definitely my ""shit just got real"" moment here and it feels awful.

I don't know if I can do this guys.  I'm praying for strength and to be thankful no one was home and no one got hurt.

BTW last night our guard had to stay home with his pregnant wife.  Instead of going without a guard I begged Cashion to bring someone else so our guard's brother came all night last night instead.  

I also wonder how many thieves Hope (our guard dog) kept away that we don't even know about.  Everyone was afraid of her bark even though she wouldn't hurt a fly.  I miss her already.  She would have scared away the thieves today for sure if she was still alive.

I normally don't panic in situations like these but since I've had Zahara I've become a changed woman.  I don't know if it is the hormones or being a new mom or both but I want the hell out of here sometimes.

1353422066.0,13id2h,Graduated early.  (Long post! You've been warned.),what_a_classy_broad,46,5,22,"I kinda wanna start out just saying this:  It feels so weird posting here.  Like I shouldn't be yet.. probably because I actually shouldn't.  A few days ago

I woke up this past Saturday morning with some dull cramping.  Thought for the first hour or so I just needed to poop in the worst way possible and maybe things were more backed up than I'd anticipated.  I spent a couple hours going about my business and trying to get it to stop in all the usual ways (drink a ton of water, fly to the moon and back on a magic sea turtle.. you know).  None of that worked.  If anything, it felt like things were getting worse.

So, bless her, called me back in less than five and told me to go ahead and come up to the hospital.  I do exactly that, all the while with the expectation that she's going to take one look at me and tell me to call her if I haven't pooped by the end of the week.  Worried as I was that something might be wrong, having this baby was still the furthest possibility from my mind.  

By the time I get to the hospital, et cetera... but the monitors aren't picking up any contractions at all.  The nurse can't feel any manually, and no one believes a word I'm saying.  I must have heard ""She thinks she's contracting,"" at least fifty times that day.  It's at this point that they go ahead and give me something to stop contractions just in case and start talking infections leading to a pretty short decision to start me on antibiotics. 

By 5:00

6:30 rolls around and I'm finally carted off to hospital #2 via ambulance.  The EMTs were probably the nicest, even in so much pain that I can hardly breathe through a contraction and am speaking in tiny two word bursts... that smell made me ravenously hungry.  

8:00pm - they've moved me to yet another room, but I've hardly noticed.  The doctors are still talking possible infection and keep telling me my water must have broken days or even weeks beforehand.  

This leads to my mother giving them the biggest bitch fit ever

Cue my water breaking and the foulest smell I've ever experienced.  Take that, oh fuck, oh my sweet baby jebus.. my water just broke.  

The doctor checks my cervix again and I've gone from the same half centimeter dilated that I'd been all day... to full on ready to go

The doctor lady is about halfway through telling me I can push if I feel like I need to when I start.  I didn't even make it through one push before the baby came flying out of me like a human cannonball

I'm not real sure what's going on with ME at this point, and everything blinked out of existence for at least two minutes.  All I could do was lay there in that gnarly mess and be relieved that it didn't hurt anymore.  

Fast forward a few days - I'm doing absolutely fine.  I came home from the hospital yesterday afternoon and I'm hardly even bleeding anymore.  

Charlotte River, she can already cry and all the NICU nurses keep telling me how well she's doing and that their biggest problem so far has been figuring out how to keep the oddly sized CPAP mask on her face.. and that getting an IV in her is every bit as hard as getting one into her mother.

This is something that keeps us at odds. He feels it's OK to sleep in on the weekends, but so what?? He gets his evenings and the whole weekend to relax. I hardly EVER get a break. I have to beg him to take the baby while I shower! It's so unfair. I'm so mad I feel like my insides are boiling. 

And to make matters worse, he'll want sexy times. And if I try to nap, he'll complain. Because what he wants is apparently more important than what I want. I hear stories of SO's that help out during the night even though they have to work, and SO's that draw candle-lit baths for their tired ladies. I believe these men to be a myth.

My name is Melissa, so emotional, or so happy in my entire life. Although no one here knows me, beyondthebump has been there with me through so much. Those sleepless first nights when I was searching for ways to just make him sleep. Those moments when I felt like a failure of a mother, when all I did when he cried was crying along with him. When I realized I suffered from some pretty terrible postpartum depression, and then when I realized that doesn’t make me a horrible mother. When Milo smiled his first real smile and I cried...again. So many moments that I will forever remember and would do anything to re-live, over and over again...the photos and videos are never enough. I want to thank you all for being there when I was at my lowest, many of you reassured me that it gets better, and wonder to yourself “when did things get so.. Great?” because WHOA...[this baby](http://imgur.com/vMGfC) is my favorite anything.

I went for my consultation to see a postpartum physiotherapist today. My son is 10 months old and was delivered with forceps and episiotomy. That is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to my issues peri &amp; postpartum. I've been enduring painful intercourse with my husband for the past five months. I've been to my gynocologist 3 times. We use lube. I use estrogen cream. I was losing hope that sex would ever be something to look forward to again. 

This physiotherapist gives me hope. She works with desensitizing the nerves while also teaching you exercises to work with the muscles and scar tissue. She works on bathroom urgency if that's an issue for you. She specializes in all this stuff I felt my gynocologist should have been able to help me with.
