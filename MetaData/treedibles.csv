I am a biochemistry student

Unfortunately, and being high and feeling chest pain of any sort is never fun.

Instead of giving up

Even though only ~30% of the THC is processed by our bodies


So here are the **essential tools and the ones I use:**

* [Coconut Oil](http://www.amazon.com/Nutiva-Certified-Organic-Virgin-Coconut/dp/B000GAT6NG): Coconut oil is the best choice for our cannabis edibles for several reasons. The first is that it consists of 100% saturated fat, which takes energy.

I use the Nutiva brand mostly because it is by far the highest quality that I have been able to afford. I used to use a brand from wal-mart

* [Crock Pot](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Crock-Pot-4-Quart-Slow-Cooker-Black/14922959) and Oven/Freezer Safe Tall Dish: This allows for consistent low heat

* [Soy Lecithin](http://www.amazon.com/WillPowder-Soy-Lecithin-Powder-16-Ounce/dp/B00250UC92): Soy lecithin is an emulsifier that increases the bio-availability of the final oil

* [Coffee Grinder](http://www.amazon.com/Proctor-Silex-E160BY-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B00006IUX5/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1364962223&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=coffee+grinder) and Small Brush: Our goal is to grind the cannabis as finely as possible such that it nearly becomes a kief-like powder so that most of it literally dissolves into our oil. You'll need a brush to minimize waste

* Aluminum Foil
* Of course

**Procedure:**

**1. Decarboxylation**

First we must decarboxylate our cannabis. In raw cannabis, but it takes a tremendously long amount of time.

It is a misconception that decarboxylation is unnecessary due to the heat provided once the cannabis is actually in the oil. Unfortunately, ensuring that most of our THCa will be converted by the end of the process.

In order to do this

Place it in the ~225F oven for 20-25 minutes

**2. Grinding**
Example Picture: [Before and After Grinding](http://imgur.com/a/CCIv2#0)

Your goal is to grind the cannabis as finely as possible. We grind after decarboxylating to ensure an even finer consistency. **I strongly recommend taking your time with this step.** It really pays off to focus on minimizing waste. There will be kief on the cover of the coffee grinder, remember that 2% is multiplied by 4-5x due to the nature of 11-Hydroxy-THC.

In the example picture

**3. Adding Lecithin and Oil**

After grinding

As for the oil, it takes 1/3 cup oil. Out of my half ounce of cannabis, I can make 2 7g batches of muffins, so I will add 2/3 cup oil, and use 1/3 in each batch.

**4. Processing**

Place your dish inside of the crockpot on low for 3 hours. Keep in mind that crock pots take a good ~20-25 minutes to actually get truly hot

After 3 hours

To understand why **freezing is important**

After freezing

Heat inside the slow cooker for another 3 hours. I start the 3 hour countdown once the oil has liquidified again

Follow this by another 2 hour freeze. Afterwards

[Final Oil](http://imgur.com/bZjbsxN)

It should be **black enough to reflect the rim of the dish**

While straining out the plant matter

Be extremely careful with this oil as it is very potent. 

Smaller doses are also possible. I can use an eighth of cannabis and make a personal batch of potent edibles that will last me for 24 days.

Basically

**Items Needed**

* large pot to put water in
* water
* stove
* weed (quality/quantity up to you
* butter or oil
* glass mason jar
* coffee grinder (optional)
* shit to strain with (also optional)

**Method**

* fill your pot with water (I try to fill it up so much that my mason jar will be floating so it doesn't come into contact with the bottom of the pan)
* boil it
* put your weed in the coffee grinder
* or get your marijuana into small pieces some other way
* put weed + butter or oil into mason jar
* throw that shit in hot water and let it ride
* you may want to shake it from time to time
* when you can't wait any longer (shoot for at least 30 minutes, that shit is hot)
* once cool enough to touch

And that's it. No more waiting for your butter/water mixture to separate, and there's little to no smell while cooking! I;ve also used this method to infuse a glass jar of organic peanut butter with weed and make space peanut butter. Try it with all types/amounts of weed into whatever fatty substance you want, find something that works for you! I think my next experiment will be putting weed into heavy whipping cream, then whipping it to put on pie or something, but it may be a while before I try.

Enjoy!

1365382516.0,1bvxtr,The Ultimate Marijuana Tincture,MarmaladeMatt,68,8,22,"This is a project I've been working on for some time. I was inspired by the lack of consistency found in marijuana tincture and green dragon recipes all over the web (including those in the sidebar). After long hours of research and much trial and error I finally feel confident enough in my knowledge to write up this recipe. If you're looking for qualifications I can't provide many

**The Ultimate Marijuana Tincture**

**Step 1: Gathering the Supplies**

You're going to need the following items:

 * 1 ounce of high quality Buds 
 * A bottle of high-proof
 * Mason jar - 8 oz. or larger 
 * Access to an oven with stove top and vent hood 
 * Baking sheet and aluminum foil
 * Kitchen thermometer (must read up to 225°F accurately) 
 * Coffee Grinder (preferred) or herb grinder
 * Cooking Pot
 * Cheese Cloth or fine metal strainer

Substitutes: 

 * Other high-proof (150+) alcohols will work
 * The mason jar is my go to
 * Forgoing the thermometer is not recommended
 * In place of a grinder one can use a cup and scissors

Before I continue I would like to note that using an oven is a necessary step in this recipe

**Step 2: Decarboxylation**

Decarboxylation (decarb.) is a chemical process by which a carboxyl group is removed from a molecule. In this case we are decarbing THCA (tetrahydrocannabinolic acid) into THC. This is accomplished by the removal of a carbon group from the THC molecule through exposure to heat

There is talk of another chemical process in some tincture recipes I've seen that is called isomerization. In theory

The Process:

 * Begin by preheating your oven to 225°F 
 * Next
 * Take the baking sheet and wrap aluminum foil over it
 * When the oven has preheated
 * As the weed cooks you'll begin to notice a distinct smell of vaped marijuana, not THC
 * Near the end of cooking the weed will be slightly browner than before and have a crispy texture
 * Remove the aluminum foil

**Step 3: Mixing up the Potion**

This is the most crucial phase of the recipe. Failure here will mean failure on the whole. 

- Take the empty mason jar and
- Fill the jar up with alcohol until the weed is completely submerged
- Seal the jar and shake for a couple minutes to agitate the solution

Done!

**Step 4: Collecting all the Goodies**

At this point we have a more or less finished marijuana tincture. Congrats! However

- Place the mason jar gently inside the cooking pot and fill the pot with water until the water is level with the alcohol solution in the jar
- Remove the mason jar from the water
- Bring the pot of water to a roiling boil
- As soon as the water has stopped boiling place the mason jar back into the pot
- While the pot is still under the vent hood watch the solution carefully and gently stir
- The alcohol solution will reach a slight boil momentarily as the water cools to below 175°F
- Once the alcohol stops boiling you can stop stirring and set the entire set up

Personally I use a kitchen thermometer to measure the heat of the solution throughout this entire process (mine doubles as a stirring stick) and try to add more boiling water in small amounts to keep the temperature as close to 170°F as possible for up to an hour. The above steps are designed to keep you safe and get the job done without needing to use a thermometer. The choice is yours. 

There are many viable variations to the above steps

At this point you can strain the solution and remove any solids from the mixture. Drape some cheese cloth over a separate container and dump the mixture into the cloth

**Storage and Dosage**

Once the above solution has cooled down to about room temperature (if it's slightly warm and you can't wait any longer then no worries) you can return the lid to the mason jar and reseal it. The solution should be stored between 70-85°F in a dark place (the spice cabinet works great) to prevent any loss of potency over time. The solution should keep for a year or more if stored properly

You're best off figuring out the proper dosages for yourself as everyone metabolizes things differently, a shot glass full will send you to space. Take care, this is a very potent tincture.

1361772684.0,196ga2,How to make Cannabutter Smell Free,ColeChuk,47,7,27,"Hey ents!

I see alot of interest in a solid method of cooking cannabutter in a jar of some sorts in order to keep the smell down

At the bottom of this guide, let me know. If I post something that I say I am unsure of and you know it's correct, also let me know!


**BEGINNING OF GUIDE* (General Information, Techniques)

So basically, which is not ideal at all. I cannot guarantee that your jar will not explode when you make butter, however if you follow some of the tips in this guide it like help reduce the chance of it happening. I have never had this happen to me, but I cannot guarantee that it will not happen to you. However, I have came up with some preventative measures to keep this from happening so that you can cook some pretty badass butter without the smell. 

Also, and overheat the cannabinoids causing them to vaporize. If you could care less about the smell, or would like the smell use a pot for every step where I say to use a jar and you will have yourself some mighty fine, easy to make and instantly ready to use cannabutter.

Alright
First off

* Butter and weed


* A mason jar 

A note on the jar: Jar size is pretty important here. You want a jar that has a capacity of about twice the space that the butter and weed will take up. Also be sure to use a mason jar

* Cheesecloth or ~~Pantyhose~~ Clean Pantyhose (to strain the weed from the butter)

Cheesecloth can be bought at most grocery stores. It is usually with the cooking gadgets.

* Rubber Gloves (the jar will be a bit hot

* Rubber Band (to tighten the cheesecloth around the jar)


Lets talk quantities. You should be using about 1 ounce of average grade cannabis for every 1 pound of butter. So if you are using shake, but if you are lucky enough to, maybe use 3/4 of an ounce of cannabis for every 1 pound of butter. 


Lots of recipes for cookies/brownies etc call for 1/2 cup of butter

Also keep in mind here that if you actually feel like enjoying a full cookie/brownie and you dont have a high tolerance

Next tidbit of info that you should know is the importance of decarbing your weed before you mix it with the butter and start cooking it. Decarbing is done by using heat of about 215F to turn the THCa into THC, making your butter even more strong.

The reason why I chose 215F, it prevents possible vaporization of any cannabinoids. Also, this keeps the pressure in the jar under control. Using the information from [this](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/543218-Specific-boiling-points-and-roles-of-cannabinoids) thread, we can see that the lowest point of vaporization of a cannabinoid is ~246F. This means we have plenty of cushion to prevent vaporization. Also note the THC content graph a ways down the page. If we were to imagine that the graph continued for more time, this shows that at ~223F it would take about 2 hours to reach a maximum THC absorption.


**IMPORTANT**: Since we are heating the jar and it is completely sealed, as it will have a lower chance of having microscopic cracks that could initiate a blowout.

**Decarbing** 
To decarb your trees, super! If not, a grinder, credit card, or scissors should suffice. PROTIP: While grinding, preheat your oven to 215F.

One it is as fine as you can get it, and shake it occasionally. At the 10 minute point, it might be a good idea to open up the jar slowly and ""burp"" it (let out any pressure that may have built up). Also, to keep smell down, you can take your jar outside to burp it. I would highly suggest to NOT do this if it is cold outside, being that the quick temperature transition could lead to your jar to break/explode. Once you burp it, put it back in for the remaining time. Once the 20 mins is up

**Cooking Process**

Next step would be to take your butter and melt it. I did it by chopping up my butter into smaller pieces, and I checked on it about halfway through and the butter had boiled all over the place in my microwave, and was annoying to clean up.


So now your cannabis is decarbed and your butter is melted. Now all you have to do is put the butter into the jar with your decarbed cannabis

While it is cooking, however, when I opened it after the 3 hours of cooking, there was quite a bit of pressure released when i opened the jar and it caused the butter to froth up from the rapidly escaping air and some of it spilled out. So I would suggest to just burp it every time you shake it (lol). If you are super concerned about a blowout, you *could* screw on the lid of the jar while the jar is in the oven, which would mean that the air inside would expand less then room temperature air. However, the chance you burn yourself by doing this might not be worth the preventative measure that this prevents.

So now your butter is done cooking, as well as your elastic band. This is what you should you should set up, except in this picture I don't have the elastic around the jar to secure the cheesecloth. Also, don't use a dryer sheet like I did in this picture. http://imgur.com/8Cbqev2

So basically just slowly pour the butter into the the ""strainer"" and let the butter drip through. Once you have it all poured through


**BOOM**

You are done. You have the nectar of the ents. Go ahead and mix this in with anything that calls for butter. Many people use a store bought premade mix that you just add butter to


That's it! If you have any questions

I actually haven't tried any of my cookies since I am on a break because I have job interviews



Edit: Formatting

Feb 25 2013: I was just doing some research about the dangers of exploding mason jars. It appears that when people can fruits or whatever in jars

Feb 26 2013: Included explanation of cooking temperature

Another thought I had was that when cooking

Also changed my suggestion to take it outside to burp it


April 13th 2013: Was doing some thinking the other day. I thought that if you were to completely fill the jar with butter

Also does anyone now how I can space out the paragraphs more so it is less of a text wall?

I am very happy to be able to bring you this adventure

I was excited to be at the 30th anniversary of the fabled 1967 Summer Of Love, and I certainly had no inkling of my future self as Old Hippie.

I wrote most of this up the same night it happened (except the last paragraph), but it was password-protected to keep it out of the prying eyes of search engines (they had those too!). So only my closest friends — less than a dozen people — have ever read this before today.

After I started writing as Old Hippie, although I knew I had saved it. Finally, I discovered it in a ZIPped archive that I had made last century, and knew I had to share it with you. Today.

Notes:

* My sons were 3 and 8 at the time.
* I’ve left everything exactly as it was in the 1997 original, which made it very hard to read. However, [I have preserved that background here for posterity](http://askoldhippie.com/).
* I know you’ll want the recipe. I haven’t tried it yet
* My biggest surprise was that the Summer Of Love website is still up and running and looking great!

Nugs and hugs forever
Old Hippie

P.S. Dedicated to D.T. and all good daddies everywhere.

*I'll tell you exactly what I did. You know; for science!* 

* 8g medium grade weed

* 1/2 cup + 2 Tbs sunflower oil (the extra 2 Tbs is to make up for volume lost through the process; the final result will be aprox. 1/2 cup of canna-oil)

1) Weed &amp; oil were mixed in a pan.

2) The mixture was kept on very low heat (about a 2 on a dial that goes to 10). Didn't even bring it to the point of simmering; just got it really hot.

3) Left it like this for about 2.5-3 hours. The weed had a thoroughly vaped appearance at the end; it was dark brown/blackish. 

4) The hot mixture was poured into a glass container and covered.

5) The weed-oil mixture was allowed to sit for 3 days at room temperature. It was stirred once each day. 

6) The weed was then strained from the oil using cheese cloth (cheese cloth works great because you can really squeeze out every last drop of oil-be sure to use a few layers of cheese cloth when straining to ensure your finely ground weed can't get through the holes). The used weed was discarded.

7) The oil was used to make 2 boxes of [Betty Crocker Frosted Brownie](http://www.bettycrocker.com/products/brownies-and-dessert-bars/products/betty-crocker-frosted-brownie) which was baked in two equal sized pans (1 box per pan). Each pan was cut into 8 pieces so each brownie contained 0.5g worth of weed. Read on to learn about the importance of eating only half of one of these brownies

WARNING: THESE ARE *VERY* POTENT!!!

**RESULTS/CAUTIONARY TALE**

I baked these brownies for a friend's new year's eve party. As a daily toker I have a pretty high tolerance and every time I bake brownies

Of the 6 people who ate the brownies at 11pm, and a guy who used to smoke as much as us. We reached a solid [8] and had a great time. The others? 

First one down was an occasional smoker who at first explained to us that he felt like Sulley from Monsters Inc.; it was like he could feel soft fur extending from his skin and gently waving as he moved. But by 12:30am he sat silent

The second one down was also an occasional smoker. She was less descriptive of her high but she ended up throwing up and going to sleep by 2am. 

I felt really really bad about the third guy. He pretty much never smoked and he did not want to reach the [10] that he got. Just after midnight he pulled me aside and I realized just how high he was. You see kids, he hid it well from them, but internally he panicked. He described how he kept thinking in loops that  kept leading him back to how not high his friends were and what they would think if they knew what was going on in his head. His girlfriend was in the room and he tried to communicate this to her...telepathically. Funny enough, she figured out something was up and sent him to bed. Unfortunately he was too high to sleep and just kept panicking. After his sober friends left, he came back to the party to inform us between raucous laughter and panicked tears just how high he was and just how high he didn't want to be. He woke up still stoned out of his head the next day and had to call in sick to work. It's been 24 hours and I still haven't heard if he ever came down.

**TL;DR:** My less experienced friends got much higher than they wanted; one went comatose (not literally) and was still high for most of the next day

**The Moral?**

1321498997.0,mf7rg,OK fuckers lets make some goddamn green dragon (liquid trees),emr1028,33,3,17,"Ok

Things you will need:

Either vaporized trees

High proof alcohol. You should probably have a minimum of 70% alcohol. Make sure this is the type of alcohol that is safe to drink

Coffee filters

A double boiler system

An extra jar or cup or really a glass container of any sort


1. Ok so first thing is first. THC will not do anything to get you high if it hasn't been heat activated through a process known as decarboxylation. If you are using pre-vaped weed, grind that shit up and throw it in an oven at 315F for about 5 minutes. You don't want it to get hotter, because you don't want to vaporize the mind altering chemicals.

2. Take either your cooked or vape weed

3. Obvious if the top of your double boiler is alcohol and trees

4. Boil down the alcohol until it's maybe 1/4 or so of what you started with. The amount that you boil it down to now is irrelevant

5. Strain out the alcohol using your coffee filters into the separate container. You want to leave as much plant matter in the original container as possible

6. Pour more high proof alcohol into the top part of the double boiler (the container with all of your plant matter) and repeat step 4.

7. Pour out the alcohol and filter it with a coffee filter into the same container as step #5. This time though

8. Take the container with all of your alcohol sludge gunk stuff

9. Boil it until you have a concentration that you are happy with. 

Congratulations

1375651704.0,1jp8j0,Bongserpent's Guide to Decarboxylation (xpost from r/trees),Bongserpent,38,7,7,"Nobody read this on trees so I figured it belongs here.

Decarboxylation is a big word and in layman's terms it means heating up your bud to the point and for the duration that the maximum amount of THC acid is converted to psychoactive THC. The practical importance of this is to increase potency of the bud you will be cooking or making essential oil extracts with. Decarboxylating doesn't do a whole lot for smoking
http://michiganmedicalmarijuana.org/topic/35900-the-importance-of-decarboxylation-in-edible-making/

My favorite way to decarboxylate is to use my oven. Putting your dope in the oven at the precise temperature and time allows the THCA to convert without vaporizing anything.

The first step is to get your dope.

http://i.imgur.com/y38QVPm.jpg

I use fresh bud straight off the plant. (Week 7 flower of an 8 week cycle so they're just about ready anyway) You can do this with dry bud as well

I like to fashion myself a little tinfoil boat with a hat to put my dope into. I don't know if there are alternatives to using foil but it works pretty well for me. Notice that I don't cut my buds up beforehand. I'm not sure if it matters though

(x-post from /trees),highaboveme,27,2,10,"My girlfrient and I made a batch of canndy using the [recipe that has been posted multiple times here](http://www.reddit.com/r/treedibles/comments/r3wwe/our_attempt_at_making_the_canndy_recipe_xpost/)

After reading a few of the other reviews we decided to use 5g of trees (instead of 3.5g

Against the advice of the original poster we used a gas stove which we understand is VERY DANGEROUS when working with 190 proof alcohol.  Whenever I was stirring or adding the jar to the flame my girlfrient was standing eight feet away with a fire extinguisher

When we got to the second part everything seemed to be going fine, no trees had been added yet.  As for the heating/boiling times of the sugar mix this is what we experienced:


+0'00"" Start

+15'00"" Hit 250-degrees; added four drops of coloring.

+19'30"" Hit 300-degrees; removed from heat.



When we added our extract/flavor mixture I was wearing eye protection (sunglasses) per the instructions to protect against splattering.  I poured the extract/flavor mixture into the cooked sugar mix but it did not splatter so I removed the sunglasses.  AS SOON as I started stirring it started splattering

It didn't smell badly of trees or anything, along with every other fan in the apartment running full blast.  No harm done, it was just uncomfortable while I was stirring.	

When we were at Hobby Lobby buying the oils (the only place we could find them other than on Amazon.com or LorAnn's website) they were out of stock on hard candy molds.  The ones Hobby Lobby and other craft stores sell for making chocolate lolipops and candies specifically says ""DO NOT USE FOR HARD CANDY MAKING.""  Instead, we picked up four of the small ice cube trays that make 0.50"" x 0.50"" x 0.50"" ice cubes.  We sprayed these down with Pam before starting the boil, and once we had everything mixed we poured the mix into the trays.  As you can see from the picture below we overestimated the amount of molds we would need.

After pouring I left them in front of an open window for two hours

I wrapped up the candy in foil wrappers that we also bought at Hobby Lobby in doses of 1s, and a couple 4s, (as you can see from the picture it made about 80 pieces.)  While wrapping I ate broken chunks amounting to about 3+ pieces of canndy.  Forty-five minutes later I was starting to feel it.  After ninety minutes I was passed out asleep.  

I later ate two and the high was much nicer.  Nice body high and slight head buzz.  However, and cannot be crunched down on in your mouth like a Jolly Rancher.  As they are sucked on they turn into an almost taffy-like consistency.  

If I make this recipe again I will probably use 1.5 Tbsp or even 2.0 Tbsp of the recommended Tart &amp; Sour mix (1.0 Tbsp is the recommended amount) in an attempt to better mask the tree flavor.  Although these taste better than any other edible I have had you definitely know what you are eating.

I'll be using a bastardization of Mrs. Bliss' tincture recipe as a reference. (actual recipe can be found [here](http://www.blissedibles.com/blog/3))

I have a light chemistry background and am currently in an undergraduate Biochem program

The major inconsistencies I found between claims of different recipes are:

* Use of Decarboxylated Buds vs. Buds with the carboxyl group attached (THC vs THCA) 
* Cooking Temperatures and Times (If heating is even involved) 
* Validity of Ethanol as a solvent
* Potency and Purity of final product 

My research has led me to conclude the following bits of information: 

* Decarboxylization occurs at 222° F 
* THC will bond to organic solvents between 325°-355° F
* THC boils at 355° F and above
* Pure THC has a flash point of ~300° F but will not boil in normal atmospheric conditions until higher temps
* THCA readily bonds to polar solvents
* THC/THCA/CBA are all hydrophobic and will not bond with water when heated

This being a tincture

* It has both polar and non-polar ends
* It has a low combustion temperature when heated
* Ethanol will boil at 173.1° F 

Knowing the above I've come to create a tincture recipe that I will post below in the comments. My main goal is to discuss the above information and find inaccuracies in my research,False,self,t5_2t3z8,1342133818.0,,,t3_wgr7a

1374379521.0,1iqfm2,Results of first attempt at OldHippie's canna caps recipe,trees_thaway_72013,25,3,5,"**Background**: Up until recently

**Ingredients**:
8g of Blueberry

Store-brand organic coconut oil

A bit of powdered soy lecithin

**Procedure**:
I'm not going to repeat the obvious from the recipes mentioned above

Decarbed in a preheated mason jar in the oven. (Preheat oven and jar, screw ring on partway.) This contained the odor pretty effectively; I wouldn't have wanted anyone to walk into my apartment while I was doing it, but my HEPA filter unit cleaned the air up pretty quickly.

I did the oil extraction in a different mason jar inside a crock pot. The thermal conductivity was pretty poor; it took a long time for the mason jar to reach the goal temperature. (I have a temperature gun that I used for measurement.) While I'm a bit skeptical of EdibleOnly's claim regarding cell wall breaking through freezing

In the end, added more oil, and then separated it out again. The oil produced this time was much more diluted but still far from clear. I ended up with enough oil for about 40 capsules, meaning each had the equivalent of about 0.2g worth, give or take.

The filling was a bit sloppy; I'll do better next time.

**Results**:

I took one. No effect for two hours

While walking down the stairs I blinked and

I ended up having mild auditory hallucinations, constantly unsure whether I'd actually said something or merely imagined saying it, while waiting what felt like an hour for her to reply to each thing I said. Meanwhile, I experienced something reminiscent of the ""eternal waking"" scene from an early issue of Sandman: I'd fall partway asleep for a second or two, start dreaming something, then wake up and immediately fall into another one, repeating over and over. It sucked

**To do**:
Break up the capsules and dilute. By 3-4x or so. This is going to be a pain in the neck.

**Lessons learned**:
I didn't do the typical newbie mistake of taking another one when the first one didn't work immediately

1367507649.0,1djz15,My First Experience... Cosmic Caramels! Thank you reddit!,pizzadare,23,1,14,"Hello All!  This week I just finished up my first ""bake"" for edibles.  This was not only my first experience making edibles, skip to the bottom of this post.  If you're interested in an in-depth review of my process

So I chose to make ""Cosmic Caramels"" as I believe they are called.  The reason being that I'm going to a huge 2 day rock concert festival this weekend and I wanted to be covert as possible.  I needed something that may keep in my pocket, we will be working with local police officers to ensure public safety.""  Which I am guessing means, we're gonna be busting people for weed.  Well, I can't have that.  

So after some research I choose to follow [this method](http://www.420magazine.com/forums/cannabis-edibles/37701-cannabutter-7-easy-steps.html) for my weed butter.  

I also was using fresh nuggetry

And my final goal was to make treats using [this recipe](http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-soft-chewy-caramel-candies-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-180832) for my caramels.  


So I began by seeking out a quarter of kind(or is it kine?) bud.  I paid 110 for right at 8 grams of [bud](http://imgur.com/XKqF6jc.jpg)    

I popped the bud into a coffee grinder and pumped the button about 3-4 times to grind it up [quite nicely](http://imgur.com/gyGp5o6.jpg)
Notice the scale says 7 now.  It had been jumping from 7-8 both before and after grinding it.  If I had included the bag it came in

Next put your bud [on some tin foil](http://imgur.com/jOe4q7r.jpg).  I was almost out of tin foil as you can see.  I bought some more before the end of this.  I then preheated my oven to [230^o](http://imgur.com/r9sHPPx.jpg) and left it in there for 30 minutes.   Once every 10 minutes

Once it was done


Now I was done for the day unfortunately.  I had a small window of kitchen time usage for this sort of thing.  So I took this opportunity to [practice](http://i.imgur.com/PLixpof.jpg) the caramel recipe.  I did two practice runs and still had trouble getting it just right in the final result.  I really suggest you try a few times unless you're already good at candies or caramels.  

Fast forward to day 2 and I start making my butter.  I feel like this is the area I second guessed myself the most on.  I just felt like I was going to ruin 100 bucks worth of awesome bud.    

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/t2hWvJG.jpg) was the first thing I second guessed.  The recipe says boil the water.. THEN add the butter.  I just put the butter in.  This freaked me out for a while because I had added my butter and water at the same time and boiled it.  I eventually added a tablespoon more of butter to make myself feel better. (it probably didn't matter) After the butter melted


[This](http://i.imgur.com/8cwLtiA.jpg) is what it looked like after I added my bud.  I worried alot about whether or not it should bubble at all.  I adjusted my temperature a lot between having tiny little bubbles appearing steady

This mix had to sit on the stove for 3 hours.  I stirred it every 30 minutes.  Now is a good time to [pause for the cause](http://imgur.com/AqLRDpw.jpg).  Afterwards I got kind of artsy with my picture taking of some [scented candles](http://imgur.com/LXXolKe.jpg) and [air freshener](http://imgur.com/n2nz0Nx.jpg).  You most definitely want to make sure you have both of these when decarbing or cooking weed.  Otherwise your home will stink for a day or two.  (I like glade candles and spray)  

Now is a good time to [prep your container](http://imgur.com/j39OK2B.jpg) for when the butter finishes.  The recipe calls for 4 layers of cheese cloth rubber banded to the top of some Tupperware.  I was also almost out of cheese cloth... so I used this skiny one.   

[This](http://imgur.com/bz9LvtL.jpg) is what my butter mixture looked like when it was done...  Kinda gross.  You will then [filter this through your cheese cloth](http://imgur.com/EZBXoCy.jpg) making sure to thoroughly squeeze the juice out of the cheese cloth.  There will be alot in there.  [This](http://imgur.com/ozc4AJ2.jpg) was what it looked like once I was done pouring it.      

Once I was done with that, I hope I didn't just go through all this trouble to just throw 100 bucks away.""  But you must remain vigilant!  I also took this time to [enjoy a brew and lick the spoon clean](http://imgur.com/lXy3rqd.jpg).  The butter has to sit in the fridge overnight to settle.  So my day in the kitchen was done.  

[This](http://imgur.com/OscYDdi.jpg) is what I found waiting for me in the morning.  Being that my containers were so cheap and I have about 30 of them

So... now that the butter is made

[First](http://imgur.com/2Ku0uzP.jpg) I had to prep the mold pan by lining it with either wax paper or tin foil.  I ended up using tin foil because the wax paper seemed to melt when I poured the caramels in it.  Also

[Second](http://imgur.com/iFSbLHQ.jpg) combine your butter, helping it set later on during the cooling phase.  So rather than a quarter tsp of salt, i used a little less than a half.  When it's done, it should look like [this](http://imgur.com/kJ6Il60.jpg).  (If you're using regular butter, this mix will be white.  Once the butter's melted, just set that to the side to add to the sugar later.   

[Third](http://imgur.com/eTEMoY0.jpg) mix your sugar

[Fourth](http://imgur.com/jajQGG3.jpg) you cook the syrup.  After a certain temperature


[Fifth](http://imgur.com/zO5PQTo.jpg) You will whisk in your butter cream mix into the sugar syrup mix.  Then heat it up kind of slowly to 250 degrees.  This whole process(from step 1 of the caramel until now) probably only took about 10 minutes with a good stove.  

[Sixth](http://imgur.com/5c8KUkd.jpg) empty your caramel mix into a pan.  I noticed mine has a lot of little bubbles in it.  Those little bubbles later looked like little cannabutter bubbles. I'm not sure what's up with that.  I suppose maybe that happens when you have funny colored butter and heat the caramel to hard rock.  


Once you are done

Also, I found myself at about a [4.5](http://imgur.com/YYDQsFH.jpg).  I was so happy!  I didn't fuck up!    

After the caramels cool

The final part is optional, so I had to get a little brush out and brush them off before wrapping them up.  And it took me about an hour to wrap every single candy up in wax paper.    

**THE FINAL PRODUCT!**   

I ended up with [68 pieces of candy!](http://imgur.com/LKyWYyl.jpg)  

[Here is a close up of an individual candy.](http://imgur.com/fExvc2m.jpg)  

And [This](http://imgur.com/crFjFFs.jpg) is how I am storing them until time for the show.  I put 20 in each large grocery bag and kept 8 out to gauge tollerance.  

What I've found is the 2 will get me to about the same as my 3 spoonfulls did.  About a 4.5.. My girlfriend says she was definitely at a 5.  But she does weigh about 120 pounds less than I do.  (I'm a big guy)  I would expect 3 to take me to a 6 and maybe 4 could get me to a 7 or 8.  I have not fully tested yet

I did some quick cost justification.  It was 110 for the bud

Recipe:
-tea bags
-1g bud
-1/2cup milk
-1tbsp butter
-hot water
-honey

-Open a tea bag and put ground bud into bag and reseal. Stapling it closed works well.
-Heat up milk and butter in the microwave until the butter is completely liquid. We did it on a lower power and stirred it a couple times over a period of about 2 minutes.
-Soak weed tea bag in the milk/butter mixture and then microwave. We did it for about a minute on a lowish power. Use your best judgement.
-Add 1/2cup hot(boiling) water to weed tea bag and milk/butter mixture and let steep for 15min.
-Brew 1/2cup regular tea stronger than normal.
-Mix regular tea with the weed/milk/butter mixture.
-I started with 1/2cup of regular tea and added 1/2cup of the weed/milk/butter/water mixture then brewed about another cup of regular tea and mixed it in since I wanted a more tea like taste.
-Add honey to taste.

I left the tea bags in my cup in hopes of getting the most from them. It's been about an hour since I started drinking the tea and I'm at a [4] and I'd say I have a decent tolerance built up. It gives you a nice body high. I doubt this is the most efficient way to do this

So I followed the post here by [loonybinjones](http://i.imgur.com/TnVHR.jpg)

I've never made hard candy before

First

I used about 7 g of ABV
I used Golden Grain instead of Everclear (Coke/Pepsi difference)
I couldn't find the flavorings he used so I just used a flavor extract(alcohol based
I went the cheap route and got the plastic candy molds, plus they were harder to pour.
I didn't have tea bags or cheese cloth
I bought a more expensive thermometer that's mounted on metal and clips to the side of the pan. This was a major hassle, the thermometer is mounted to high. This is a fairly small recipe, and towards the end the thermometer wasn't always fully submerged. I've cooked sugar down before so I recognized the stages. 

The only thing I think, and was getting a more accurate temperature reading. When it got to 300 I added the liquid in 3 batches,(On/Off heat) and when that was done, It was almost too thick to work with, even after heating. I think that you should add the liquid around 275 in batches, then work up to 300, that would prevent so much seizing up at the end

That being said

The second one, it just to strong, go with cakes or extracts.

The strength? Ehh, and there was a definite body high when I got out. Ate another on the way to work(it was dead tonight, and my last night), and I was good all night[6](high tolerance). Very hungry(which is OK, I work in kitchens), great mood, bouncy and pretty fun.

Well

Sidenote: For easier clean up(all the syrup not in molds, fill with water to the near top and simmer/boil for a little while, bout 5, 10 minutes. It will soften all the candy.

The most important thing would be that it's safe to make and consume. So I thought of the following recipe and was wondering if there's anyone with experience to comment.

- Decarboxylate 0.5 gram of cannabis
- Add it (ground up) to half a liter of vodka
- Leave the mixture in a dark place for a month
- After a month filter out any non-liquid material
- Cook out the alcohol of the vodka at 90 degrees celcius (194 Fahrenheit)

The theory is that you make standard cannabis infused vodka but cook out the alcohol. 0.5 liters of vodka would yield 0.3L of non-alcoholic vodka given that vodka contains 40% of alcohol.

* Crumble with fingers into jar with 60ml of Bacardi 151
* Simmer in water bath for 20 minutes at 75c / 167f
* Pour through Chux
* Done!

To take I use a dropper to put 1-3ml into a shot glass

* 1ml puts me at a [2] for a few hours
* 2ml puts me at a [5] for a few hours
* 3ml puts me at a [8] for 5+ hours

This is how I've been doing it:

**Ingredients:**

- 2 Tablespoons of ABV ground into a fine powder.

- 3 Tablespoons Peanut Butter (as fatty and natural as you can get it).

- 2 Tablespoons of Nutella (optional for taste but I strongly recommend it).

- Whole Milk (Whole Chocolate Milk if you prefer)

**Steps:**

1. Put all ABV

2. Put the bowl in the microwave for 2 minutes on 70% power.

3. Let it cool off for a while. Otherwise the shake will taste all gross and warm.

4. Put it in the blender with Whole Milk. Remember that you want as much fat as you can get so I have used Chocolate Milk as well.

5. Pour it out into a glass and enjoy!

Before I start I just want to point out I made my shake with Chocolate Milk

I'm new to the sub but have been doing brownies for about 10 years.  I was surprised to not see anything about the double boiler method on the sidebar.  There is a link that says double boiler

So I did my research a long time ago and at the time decided the double boiler method was best combination of simple and fast.  

Here is what I do.  Chop up 3.5-7+g trees really fine (started with chef's knife, then make brownies like normal, though I substitute both oil and water for the butter.

Anyways, but you'd have to be very diligent to not burn the butter.

I didn't do any research, I had that ""uh-oh"" feeling. A quick search was said thats it's 100 mg of infused CO2 extracted hash oil (100% Sativa) and at max, ***only half*** should be ingested at once. And even that was for a really heavy high.

1372073250.0,1gyoa3,Double Boiler Method of Cannabutter. (suggestions/help please),EntBaker,13,3,4,"Ok to start off I have made Cannabutter a few times using a double boiler method.  A real double boiler method as in pan in the bottom filled with water (boiling) with another pan fit snug above it to make all the heat from the bottom go to the top.  I have then cooked the butter at a temperature of 250 +- 5 degrees Fahrenheit for 4 hours on the first attempt.  It came out good but not THAT strong as what i hear it can be.  The second time I have made cannabutter I used the double boiler method again and cooked it at 250 +-5 degrees Fahrenheit this time for a total of 10 hours.

The first time was a lot lower of a time due to the fact that it was the first time making some type of cannabutter and i wanted to make sure i had a good first batch so i didnt want to push it too far

The second method did come out a lot better but it still didnt seem strong enough.  For the first time i used 1/2 of weed with 2 bricks of butter and the second time i used stems (didnt weigh them out) and 1/2 of weed with 2 bricks of butter.  I did put the stems in the butter for an hour before adding the weed on the second time.

Both times the finished product (pot apple cinnamon bread from scratch and pot pumpkin bread from scratch) came out good and i was able to get the taste for the apple cinnamon bread the way i want but it didn't seem that strong.  The pumpkin bread came out bad because i didnt realize how weak the pumpkin flavor from a pumpkin is :/

ok so the suggestion/help section...

  Is butter the best lipid solvent or would an oil work better/worse? (if better which oil would you suggest that wont alter the overall flavor of the canna-lipid. 

  Using the link for the [boiling points and more in depth isolation](http://forum.grasscity.com/apprentice-tokers/1055642-scientific-brownie-boiling-points-oils.html) from the side bar i got to the [boiling points of the chemical compounds](http://www.stonerforums.com/threads/specific-boiling-point-and-role-of-cannabinoids.4853/) and saw that i am way off on the temperature for cooking
&gt;Butter is used for sautéing and frying

This is why I am trying to see if there would be a better solvent to use such as an oil which would allow me to have it go to a higher temperature because of the unsaturated lipids not being able to bunch up nicely like the saturated lipids such as is in butter.

Any other suggestions as to how i can make my cannabutter stronger using the double boiling method (i find it to be the safest method to keep the temperature in check and consistent) is much appreciated.  I have seen the other methods and i dont like them.

Also i am someone who understands chemistry and am a chemist in training (well in school for Chemistry) which is why i dont like the links on the side because I was looking for a method that would give temperatures with it and if my next batch (to be done sometime this week most likely) comes out well I will write up my process in a way that will help others.

Thanks for the help i know you guys will give.  :)  Also sorry for the wall of text but i figured it would be the best way to get help would be to explain everything i have done so that way you might be able to spot an error in either my method or my thinking.",self,t5_2t3z8,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/treedibles/comments/1gyoa3/double_boiler_method_of_cannabutter/

My aim is to achieve a dosage that will help with severe pain (period pains

Have not tested yet but will post test results later on today.

----------------------

My log so far; 

AVB Tincture

Required
* Glass Jar
* Thermos 
* 3 teaspoons AVB
* 2 shot glass vodka (Smirnoff 38% used would have used higher but didn't have any)

Placed ingredients into glass jar and shook
Placed jar into a thermos with boiling water half an inch below lid of jar
Left jar sealed in thermos for 8 hours
Removed jar from thermos and shook aggressively
Left jar in back of dark cupboard for 5 hours
Retrieved sample dropper labeled X1

---------------

I will then place the jar back into the thermos with boiling water as before and leave for 12 hours hopefully doing a water change at least once and then test this batch too.

Edit1: tested x1 and as I expected it did not work. I will leave the dropper lid off so it can evaporate and become more concentrated. Not expecting much from this one due to it not sitting longer.

Hello folks! For a few weeks smoking is a no-go for me, my greatest achievement being not-ruined hamburgers, and my most common ""dish"" a bowl of rice cereal. As such, I decided to take it slow, and start with the quintessential starting point for aspiring edibles connoisseurs: firecrackers. Unfortunately I've had a less than satisfactory experience.

The first time

1. Prep: Slather two saltine crackers with a quarter centimeter of non-organic peanut butter each. 
2. Sprinkle/mix .4 evenly between them. 
3. Sandwich them both with an additional cracker each. 
4. Cover with aluminum foil (enough to wrap twice).
5. Preheat oven to 250°F.
6. Bake for ten minutes; let cool for one minute
7. Eat!

The crackers surprisingly didn't taste bad

Figuring I probably just did it wrong

1. Prep: Slather two saltine crackers with a **half** centimeter of non-organic peanut butter each.
2. Sprinkle/mix **1.0** evenly between them.
3. Sandwich them both with an additional cracker each.
4. Cover with aluminum foil (**enough to wrap once completely**).
5. Preheat oven to **295**°F.
6. Bake for ten minutes; let cool for **eleven hours**.
7. Go to work. 

When I came home from work, so I tossed the crackers (still in foil) back in for twenty minutes at **345**°F and let them cool for ten minutes, then ate them.

It's now been three hours and if I'm high at all, the amount I put in would normally be enough to shoot me to a [6] or [7] if I smoked it, so I'd figure firecrackers would send me even higher than that. Since I'm not there it makes me kind of suspicious that the very small 'buzz' I do feel is just the placebo effect.

What did I do wrong? Have I wasted a gram and a half? If it matters, I ate on an empty stomach; this time I ate about two hours after having a small lunch.

I'm trying to come up with a recipe for peanut butter cups/balls to give to my boyfriend for valentines day =)

I've never made edibles before so I'm going into this with no idea at all.

Anyway this is what I've come up with roughly:

1. Mix in a quarter cup of crushed graham crackers

2. Melt 1/8 c butter in low heat and add ground up cannabis

3. Combine butter and PB mixture

4. Melt a bar of semi sweet chocolate

5. Coat balls with melted chocolate.

6. Place on wax paper. Chill until it hardens.

expected yield is only about 4 balls because i don't know how long its shelf life is. I am not sure how long I could keep it in the fridge for

My questions are:

    
* How much cannabis should i use? Would 1 heaping teaspoon be enough?

* Should my butter be salted/unsalted? Will it matter?

* Will it be better to mix the cannabis with the butter or with the chocolate in a double boiler?

* Do I have correct ratio on ingredients?

* Exactly how long should I be cooking the weed for?

I really hope i will be doing it right

thanks guys!!

First

Next

Now I will do cold extraction. I will grind up the weed, I will pour MCT oil into the bottle. Coconut oil works very well because it has 60% medium chain tryglycerides, but using 100% MCT oil should yield the best extraction. Also, you can't cold extract with coconut oil well because it is solid at room temperature, and a liquid solution will ensure the most contact. I will then leave this MCT/cannabis solution in the bottle for three days somewhere, shaking occasionally. Finally, I will strain the cannabis using a cheesecloth and see how potent the oil is.

The second method I will use is heat-applied extraction. I will mainly utilize EdibleOnly's recipe http://www.reddit.com/r/treedibles/comments/1bkhsv/my_cannabis_oil_process_long_and_extensive_with/

I don't think I could actually take the 24 hours the book suggests to make cannabutter so my question is when I grind up my hash and mix it into my recipes is that all that is necessary to make them a successful edible?

So I followed the post here by [loonybinjones](http://i.imgur.com/TnVHR.jpg)

I've never made hard candy before

First

I used about 7 g of ABV
I used Golden Grain instead of Everclear (Coke/Pepsi difference)
I couldn't find the flavorings he used so I just used a flavor extract(alcohol based
I went the cheap route and got the plastic candy molds, plus they were harder to pour.
I didn't have tea bags or cheese cloth
I bought a more expensive thermometer that's mounted on metal and clips to the side of the pan. This was a major hassle, the thermometer is mounted to high. This is a fairly small recipe, and towards the end the thermometer wasn't always fully submerged. I've cooked sugar down before so I recognized the stages. 

The only thing I think, and was getting a more accurate temperature reading. When it got to 300 I added the liquid in 3 batches,(On/Off heat) and when that was done, It was almost too thick to work with, even after heating. I think that you should add the liquid around 275 in batches, then work up to 300, that would prevent so much seizing up at the end

That being said

The second one, it just to strong, go with cakes or extracts.

The strength? Ehh, and there was a definite body high when I got out. Ate another on the way to work(it was dead tonight, and my last night), and I was good all night[6](high tolerance). Very hungry(which is OK, I work in kitchens), great mood, bouncy and pretty fun.

Well

Sidenote: For easier clean up(all the syrup not in molds, fill with water to the near top and simmer/boil for a little while, bout 5, 10 minutes. It will soften all the candy.

1324398932.0,njze6,"Typed this up for r/asktrees. How to make special oil, or, how vegan ents make edibles.",PCsNBaseball,2,0, man. Most of the vegan butters have too low of a fat content to absorb the THC very well

1. Grind up your bud and spread it over the bottom of a smallish

2. Cover the bud with your favorite cooking oil (I liked olive or peanut). You don't need a lot; just enough to completely cover the bud. 

3. Here's the crucial part: you want to get the oil hot enough to reach a LOW simmer (not boil), though you'll have to see what your own stove does. The trick is to try and get it to stay RIGHT at the point where little bubbles begin to rise without it boiling.

4. Let simmer like that for a couple hours

5. AFTER LETTING IT COOL (found that out the hard way lol), but tend to absorb a little bit of the oil.

6. Mix that weedy green oil into any recipe requiring cooking oil. You can find some vegan brownie/muffin mixes that only require oil and water; no eggs. Another way to go is use an egg replacement: one banana and 1/4 cup of applesauce both equal one egg

Ingredients:
1 box cake mix (Your choice of flavor)
1 box instant pudding mix (Once again
1 stick of butter
1 ~ 2 cups of milk

That's it! 4 items! Two can be stored at any temperature for any length of time. The Cake mix acts as flour for the cookies

Process:
Set oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
Melt butter.
Mix cake mix and pudding mix in a bowl.
Add butter and stir.
Add milk until mixture is of a batter consistency and not powder or runny. It will be VERY thick at this point that is perfect.
Put about a tablespoon amounts on cookie sheets.
Bake for 10 minutes on a lower rack
Let cool and enjoy!

It takes some practice to figure out the timing and temp for the cookies as my original recipe had neither and I still mess around. 15 minutes on a single cooking rack should be long enough
