I play Rift for 2 Years and me and my friend always had to buy Gamecards from onlineshops with paysafecard because Rift is not supporting ELV ( The most popular online payment method in germany) and neither Paysafecard. You have to know that maybe 10% of Germans own a Credit Card so its not a Option for us and many people dont have or dont  want to use Paypal. Me and all of my friends that started playing now Have no option to support you and buy something in the Shop.

Please help us giving you Money trion and add a ELV or atleast Paysafecard option. Even before Rift went F2P many friends didnt Sub because there was no ELV

“MMOs are all about playing with your friends no matter which server they’re on, Executive Producer. “RIFT is both a game and a service, and adding free server transfers is just one more way we can make this the best possible MMO experience available.”

I started checking the value of dollars versus euros to find out how much Europeans were losing when I noticed that the amount of credits €10 bought was higher than that which $10 would buy. I was in game at the time so I thought maybe me being a patron was giving me more credits. But it wasn't. So I did the math and it turns out Trion is pretty fucking fantastic when it comes to pricing.

If you buy the small pack in the US, it'll cost you 0,6707 cents per credit.

I just thought I would share this. I'm so proud of Trion and the momentary loss of faith in them has come back tenfold. Most companies (that I've noticed) usually screw over the Europeans by quite a bit. I'm proud to be a patron and I spent €10 on some credits to celebrate their achievements!

1300852919.0,g9gcb,A Beginner's Guide to Macros,alyeong,51,12,33,"**What are they?** Macros are a tool enabled in many video games that let you string commands together to a custom button.

**Why use them?**  Generally they allow for some optimal customization.  This works well in a game like Rift which does not allow add-ons but has a ton of abilities to let you make some shortcuts to save on keybinds or help with healing targeting.  
    
**Where do I find this option?** In Rift
     
**How do I write a macro?** Macros are fairly simple in concept.  The most basic of them is ""cast [Ability Name]"".  So if I wanted to write a macro to cast Healing Breath
    
&gt;cast Healing Breath
     
Each line of a macro is separated by a line break.  So with multiple commands to chain them you would write:
    
&gt;cast Healing Breath
    
&gt;cast Healing Grace
     
**So I can chain my entire rotation to one button?  Neato Burrito!** Not exactly.  You can not chain multiple abilities to one button press.  Nor can you chain a rotation exactly.  What you can do is set a priority list by cooldown.  Basically in the macro above, it will move to the next spell on the list, Healing Grace.  It will ONLY cast Healing Grace if Healing Breath is on cooldown.  
     
**How does this work for Reactive abilities or follow ups?**: Pretty much the same way. 
     
&gt;cast Rising Waterfall

&gt;cast Power Strike
 
This will attempt to cast Rising Waterfall first.  When you start a fight you won't be able to since RW is a reactive ability.  So it will cast Power Strike.  The next time you press the button
 
&gt;cast Path of the Wind

&gt;cast Power Strike
    
Because Path of the Wind has no restrictions
    
&gt;cast Power Strike

&gt;cast Path of the Wind
    
This however
    
**So...about targets?** You are able to also customize targeting with macros.  There are a variety of things but they use an ""@"" modifier to indicate it is a target.  
    
&gt;cast @self Healing Breath
    
If you macro it
    
&gt;@lasttarget [Your Last Target]

&gt;@mouseover [The target your cursor is over.  Great for healing]

&gt;@focus [Your focus target]
    
**Is there anything else I can do with them?** Lots!  But this is a beginner's guide.  Macros can do a lot of things, marks.  There are some guides on the official forum if you get more curious.

1372134200.0,1h0o1w,Why you should buy Patron Passes from the store rather than subscribing.,noremac13,41,6,71,"So for those that don't know there are 2 ways of getting Patron status.  You can either subscribe for $14.99 a month (larger packages bring monthly cost down) or you can buy the vouchers in the store for credits.

Now in my personal situation I was going to get a 3 month subscription for $38.97 but I noticed you get much more for your money if you buy credits and use the credits to buy Patron vouchers.  Instead I bought $50 in credits and got 3 30 day Patron vouchers.

Now why is this better?

* Subscribing only gives you 7000 Loyalty per month
* Being a Patron will give you a 10% discount on buying more Patron vouchers.  You can buy 1 month at a time and still get 10% off but with subscribing you need to buy at least 3 months to get a discount.
* Patron subscriptions come with no credits

So what does spending the extra $11.03 buy you?

* 2020 ""bonus"" credits every 3 months
* 8640 extra loyalty per month (over **double**)
* When you spend the other 2020 credits that gives you another 8080 loyalty points for a total of **34000 bonus loyalty over the 3 month period**.",self,t5_2s4an,False,riftbanter,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/1h0o1w/why_you_should_buy_patron_passes_from_the_store/

A few nights ago, at level 44 or thereabouts. I've been active more in the wee morning hours lately, and a few nights ago was no exception. Town was dead, aside from two guardians standing around, not looking terribly active, or interested in me. I get myself prepped, good to go, and make my first pull.

The instant I charge in

Whatever. I have thick skin. I can shrug this off. I had my soulwalk up, some people need to 2v1 to feel good about themselves.

Eventually I get my chunk of quests done and head back to town. As I'm leaving to head on to the next quest hub, but I'm just ready to put the whole thing behind me and be done with it. So I tromp off on my turtle and don't even give him a glance.

Ten feet out of town, though. I'm stunlocked but he's taking me on alone, and I'm not the squishiest class in the game. 

GlacialShieldGlacialShieldGlacialShieldcomeoncomeonGlacialShieldGlacialShield*ohyeah*. I've got control back and still have a good chunk of health left, and my soul combo gives me three shield spells that can absorb for 600-700 each, all on 30 second CDs. Whack Whack Whack. I'm getting hits off and my health is slowly climbing back up, and his is going in the only direction a warrior's can: down. It's close, I'm seeing grey, but he drops at the last second. 

I'm not going to lie. That felt good. My heart was racing, and says, simply, ""again.""

What was he thinking? That I got lucky? He got the drop on me and I still brought him down in 1v1. So now he wants to fight with me knowing he's coming? Sure. Why not. 

I don't say a word. I just stand there. Wait for him to make his move. He charges and gets the stunlock on me again before my shield goes up

Respawns. Drinks. ""again.""

Seriously? Okay. Come at me. 

Whack whack whack whack. What's that sound? Oh, he's changed to a tank spec? This'll be fun. whack heal shield whack heal shield. It takes a pretty long time, and I had to actually regen my mana back, but sure enough, he goes down, leaving me with a sliver of health.

Of course

Pops out from stealth from behind me

I pop back up on the far side of town. The Guardians are talking.

""We couldn't let someone like him live. Defiants aren't supposed to be that strong.""

Maybe I'm supposed to take that as a compliment

Thick skin. Centering breath. They're just dicks. Nothing new. So I speak up, ""I may have been born in a tube, but I wasn't born yesterday.""

1376388464.0,1k9pz7,Infinity stone to-do list with bonuses,Frothy_Semenbeard,37,5,24,"/u/Linclin posted some info on ways to get a lot of infinity stones a day ago. I have been working on some notes on the subject and figured I'd share what I've put together as a list of things to do to get the most infinity stones each day.

There are 5 Ashora dailies

Then you have 5 Dendrome onslaughts and 3 PvP (Dendrome or Steppes) daily quests that also can be done by yourself. These also net 180 infinity stones each. You can also do the 'close 3 hunt rifts' daily which gets you 350 infinity stones with an extra 90 stones for closing 3 of them.

Lastly

For content requiring groups/raids, 'defend 3 strongholds' (300 stones + 360 for defending 3), the 'kill 25 opposing faction players' daily (270 stones), and 4 Dendrome Group dailies (180 stones each.) From what I've seen of the pvp one, folks seem to just take turns spawn camping for the 25 kills.

So

* 1) Stronghold Assault 300+360 for defending 3 of them
* 2) Great Hunt Rifts 450+90 for closing 3 of them
* 3) Daily Raid Rift 450
* 4) Hunt Rifts 350+90 for closing 3 of them
* 5) PvP 25 Killer 270
* 6) Dendrome Daily 180
* 7) Dendrome Daily 180
* 8) Dendrome Daily 180
* 9) Dendrome Daily 180
* 10) Dendrome Daily 180
* 11) Dendrome Daily 180
* 12) Ashora Daily 180
* 13) Ashora Daily 180
* 14) Ashora Daily 180
* 15) Ashora Daily 180
* 16) Ashora Daily 180
* 17) Steppes Daily 180
* 18) Steppes Daily 180
* 19) Steppes Daily 180
* 20) Steppes Daily 180
* 21) Steppes Daily 180
* 22) Steppes Daily 180
* 23) Dendrome Onslaught Daily 180
* 24) Dendrome Onslaught Daily 180
* 25) Dendrome Onslaught Daily 180
* 26) Dendrome Onslaught Daily 180
* 27) Dendrome Group Daily 180
* 28) Dendrome Group Daily 180
* 29) Dendrome Group Daily 180
* 30) Dendrome Group Daily 180
* 31) Hero's Rise Chronicle 180 (doesn't count as a daily)
* 32) Queen's Gambit Chronicle 180 (doesn't count as a daily)

If you do absolutely everything here, DRR calls in crossevents/raids, etc. as they pop up.

From what I've seen

* F2P: no bonus
* Guild perk 'Cache Finder': +5% bonus
* Patron bonus: +15% bonus
* Lesser Token Tablet (from Store): +15% bonus
* Patron's Token Buff (daily refresh): +40% bonus
* Token Tablet (from Store): +40% bonus
* Greater Token Tablet (from Store): +80% bonus
* Orange tier loyalty perk Treasure Map: +10% bonus

~~I think with the exception of the tablets and the patron's token buff

Edit: /u/Seatin has told me that they do not stack. Seatin also mentioned that you can make even more by running around Mathosia while mentored down to get infinity stones from those zone events. 

I would say that you can expect anywhere from 3000 to 10000+ infinity stones a day depending on your bonuses and how much extra stuff you can do.",self,t5_2s4an,1376418779.0,riftleveling,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/1k9pz7/infinity_stone_todo_list_with_bonuses/

**How To:**

The custom tags are all done through the custom style sheets that sub-reddits can use
If you use the Chrome browser you can right-click someones username and hit Inspect Element to get their ID

If we were adding me as a Guardian right now

    .lastuserid:before, .id-t2_49de1:before {
      content:"""";background-position:-20px 0;
    }

Since the faction tag is at the start of the username, so they use the :after attribute. If you need to add a new server to the list, you can just copy/paste one of the existing ones and remove all the old usernames.",,False,self,t5_2s4an,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/fqrik/faction_server_tags/
1375833662.0,1jujo5,Update! Rift framerate and Lag issues fixed!,Sadtimesahead,40,8,37,"Recently I made a post about Rift running like crap on my computer. I scoured the internet and and managed to fix all my issues and the game runs like a champ now. Thank you for the few people who pointed me in the right direction and with that I was able to solve my issues. For people who might be having the same issues I'll post what I did to fix it since allot of people are having the same problems.


Disable Desktop Composition and Aero 
Note: This tweak works to improve performance with every game and only works in Windows 7/Vista if the default Aero theme is active. 
If you open Windows task manager and navigate to the “processes” tab you will notice there is a process constantly running called “dwm.exe”


By default the Windows theme uses extra RAM to make all menu windows and taskbar styles look better. This option can be slimmed down
In order to turn these features off you simply need to right click on the executable or shortcut in question


-Disable Visual Themes 


-Disable Desktop Composition 


After selecting both boxes make sure to hit the “apply” button to save your changes. You will notice that whenever Rift is now started the bottom taskbar will lose transparency and look less “attractive”. Of course after the game is closed the visual style of the taskbar and all menu bars will return to normal. 


By default my “dwm.exe” process uses 40,944K or 2MB resource use. While this may not seem like a lot, it stands to reason that every bit of free memory helps system performance- especially in builds that have less total RAM installed. 


This will not harm your system in any way and can actually be disabled at any time by working backwards (unchecking the same boxes in the executable properties). 


Tweak Particle Settings


You can easily tweak the cut-off values for the game’s various particle effects by modifying the game’s configuration file. Simply update the values below in your Rift.cfg file


VfxCullDistance = 256
VFXLimit = 7500
LightingComplexity = 10.000000


Enable ""Prefer Maximum Performance"" (NVIDIA Only)
NVIDIA cards have a dynamic downclocking core so it uses less electricity and causes less heat. Occasionally in games your GPU may get ""stuck"" at a lower clock speed than what it should be at thus resulting in bad performance. By turning on ""Prefer Maximum Performance"" your GPU will more easily use more power to run at the speed it is supposed to with very little demand on the GPU. So in essence you should not see random downclocking with your GPU while playing games.


Here's how to do it:
Right click on your desktop and click ""NVIDIA Control Panel""
Click on ""Manage 3D settings"" on the left hand side of the page
Under ""Global Settings"" tab look for ""Power Management Mode"".
Most likely it will be set to ""Adaptive"" click that and change it to ""Prefer Maximum Performance"".


Run RIFT in DirectX9 mode
Depending on the age of your video card you could gain some performance by running Rift in DirectX9 mode instead of the built in DirectX11 mode it is set to run at. *NOTE* Running in DirectX9 mode will cause a little drop in graphics quality *NOTE*


In order to set Rift to run in DX9 mode do the following:
Right Click on your Rift shortcut
Add -dx9 at the end of the filepath
It should look something like: ""C:\Games\Rift\riftpatchlive.exe"" -dx9

What you need to have mastered:
Single Target DPS Vs AOE DPS - Certain bosses in Greenscale have more adds in them then others. You may be asked to switch from a boss nuking roll to an AOE roll to help out the off tanks. I suggest rogues have a specific single target DPS role (melee or ranged) and have a ranged AOE roll as well (31 ranger hybrid of some sorts.) Mages should come prepared with a Stormcaller build and be proficient with it along with their normal single target DPS role.

DPS vs Support - You may be asked to play an off role. Rogues should ALWAYS have a full 51 point Bard spec and/or Tank spec on hand

Raid Awareness - All the bosses in Greenscale have One-Shot moves besides their enrage timers (except Duke

Don't pad the meters. It doesn't matter if you are pulling 1200DPS on Hylas if the raid keeps wiping. Be prepared to sacrifice DPS for group utility.

Let me start off by saying, even buying all of the expansions when they went on sale.
I have NEVER had an MMO pull me in like Rift has. It's just a quality game and that's all there is to it. I played Aion at release and even after it went F2P and it couldnt match up to the level of polish i feel in Rift. I've played WoW, I don't feel the ""payment pressure"".

With Rift it's different, and excited to see how big the world is. Just seeing how the game has set off since it's migration to F2P, I can only see the game getting better from here. 

I have a few things I would change, which in all honesty isn't a lot to ask of a quality game. 

Rift has really won me over

If you're an MMO lover and you're on the fence about this game

To conclude, add me on Shatterbone! I'm always on!

I just came back for the free week and it's amazing to me how well Rift encourages _casual_ grouping

As you level, the Rifts and events subtly nudge you towards grouping.

At level cap, of course (and lots of them). Before I quit the game I was in a hardcore raiding guild so I didn't completely realize how much Trion accomplished on the casual grouping side. 

In other MMOs there's basically zero reason to group for casual content. When I logged into my 50 this weekend, maybe experiment with the balance changes a bit.

Nope. Within 15 minutes I was doing a rift raid daily (new to me). And it actually dropped barter items I needed! Then after that I got roped into a crafting rift group (new to me)

It's actually such a simple design, and sidesteps the incentive problem because the rewards for casual groups are in different slots than the hardcore group content. So all play styles participate. AND, the rewards are typically non-parasitic (more people = more eternal planar dusts per crafting lure).

I quit because I thought I didn't have enough time for multiplayer content. I'm resubscribing. ",self,t5_2s4an,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/jxpul/rift_best_casual_raidgroup_mmo/

Our one and only real chance of having a solid reddit startup on rift is coming up

We'll need a Guardian guild and a Defiant guild as likely we won't have consensus on that matter. 

We absolutely should host both guilds on the same server. A quick Google search brings up that there will be new server names on launch which means there'll be a small coordination hiccup until those names are released.

As for server-type: given the nature of the game I would recommend a PvP typeset. Possibly a RP-PvP typset to accommodate players of all types.

As we wait for those server names to be released

**EDIT**: Naming should probably be dead simple e.g. &lt;Reddit Guardians&gt; and &lt;Reddit Defiants&gt; (since we cannot both be &lt;reddit&gt; on the same server!)

**EDIT2**: [kuzc00 points out](http://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/fpr2p/we_have_three_days_to_figure_out_our_reddit_guild/c1hqb1g) that referencing reddit in a guildname might not fly on RP-PVP servers. I'll do my best to confirm whether or not this is okay before launch. **Update**: Some initial feedback from the official Rift forums says that Reddit in the guild name won't be a problem on an RP-PVP server.

I have also gone ahead and created [/r/redditdefiants](http://reddit.com/r/redditdefiants) for discussion on our defiant faction

**Link to the spec:**
http://rift.magelo.com/en/soultree#l8g/DkGBiBhlkl8/n8

**Video Guide:**
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLLyPNJguQI

**Buffs:**

* Armor of Devotion
* Fury of the Fae
* Vegence of the Winter Storm
* Subtlety
* Aid of the Forest

**Macro's:**

**Single Target:**


 #show Fervent Strike

suppressmacrofailures

cast [notactive] Spirit of Asphodel

cast Fae Mimicry

cast Essence Strike

cast Combined Effort

cast Resounding Blow

cast Massive Blow

cast Fervent Strike

cast Trickster's Bolt

**AOE:**


 #show Wild Strike

suppressmacrofailures

cast [notactive] Spirit of Upheaval

cast Wild Strike

**Pets:**

* Single target DPS: Satyr Destroyer
* AOE: Greater Faerie Seer WITH toggled ability fae dispersion on
* Soloing: Greater Satyr Protector

**Single Target Rotation:**
Eruption of Life -&gt; Crushing Force -&gt; Spam Macro x4 -&gt; Vex -&gt; Then continue to spam your macro while reapplying both Crushing Force and Vex whenever they fall off.

Your eruption of of life will be continually refreshed by essence strike provided you stick to the same target

**AOE Rotation:**
Wild strike forever. However it can be an all around dps increase to use the ST macro 4 times when you have Fae Mimicry off cooldown


**Utility:**

*Interrupts/Silences:*

* Notion Theft: Interrupt
* Grim Silence: Interrupts the target and silences it for 5 seconds

*Movement:*

* Fae Step: Teleports to the Enemy and gives you a 50% speed increase for 5 seconds
* Ride the Lightning: Charges toward the Enemy

*Other*

* Slumber, 30 second CD, on the GCD


**Protips:**

* Druid is going to burn your mana like crazy
* You can take Spirit of Unheavel and Spirit of Asphodel out of your macro's and manually toggle them which in certain scenario's can lead to a possible dps increase.


It is as easy as that!

Hey Reddit RIFT community

First and foremost, so I am by no means a WoW fan boy. I actually play Rift and really enjoy it. (Lvl  Warrior Pally/Reaver)


That being said I find the WoW bashing reflects poorly on the Rift/Reddit community and it makes us look immature and incapable of being rational human beings (or a rational HiveMind?). Be doing this it will also help strength our community and make us less off putting to the curious WoW players out there. As such I would like to request that the gross WoW bashing,** but the constant 
&gt;""People who play WoW are stupid"" or ""Blizzard doesn't know what they are doing


really should stop.     

Yes is the power player in the genre

Of Course

Fast forward to now, no matter what game I have been playing, wow, swtor, me3, just anything really. I was browsing /r/rift for some random reason since it's one of my subbed reddits and said fuck it, and started playing again.

Let me start by saying dam there is alot of new content now, I wanted to play Rift.

So when I got the game I had made the decision to be Defiant (bear in mind that I thought this was a big decision because it was a big deal in WoW... well to me it was) I made a Bahmi warrior and I began my journey

So skip ahead about a week or so and i'm in Scarlet Gorge and my friends who had also bought Rift are now a little bit ahead of me. So hopefully everyone knows about the fire rift that almost constantly appears in the camp in Scarlet Gorge

Well I grabbed my daily for it and saw that it was giving an award to destroy the Rift

So the next thing I know im in the rift and we are completely surrounded by monsters everywhere. The Bahmi (who happened to be a tank) was taking on about 3-4 guys while me and my pet were helping out as best as we could. We were getting absolutely swarmed by people and we had just finished wave 1 (already I was tired from all the fighting). So as wave 2 approached we kind of strayed off behind a rock and thought of a game-plan. He charged an elite demon that was amongst the crowd and I followed in after him. 

He was getting hit pretty hard and was about the die

At this moment I was inspired, but what I wanted to bring up, is that this game is much different from WoW, because all of the veterans that are transferring over seem to be so much nicer and the general community is much more respectable. 

I respect Trion so much for making such an amazing game

Couple things I want to address before I move into the content is that these items I am establishing are simply guidelines. They are by no means mandatory

One of the biggest differences between SL dungeons and old world dungeons in the current format is that almost every dungeon in SL has some kind of soft wipe mechanic.  What this means is if you don't move/hid or interrupt when you need to

First off

**#1 crafted blues

**#2 Farming empyreal sourcestones from carnages to buy tanking greens from the adventure vendor in Tempest Bay.**

**#3 Dungeon drops (catch 22) since you need to be geared in the first place to farm for the drop.**

There are some world rare drops that have tanking stats

You may be wondering why they designed it this difficult for tanking gear in the first place. Well

**DEFILER soul from cleric/NECROMANCER soul from MAGE is an exception to this rule since they can provide a 30% damage reduction from links!**

So let me get to the point

**Exodus of the Storm Queen -15K**

**Storm Breaker Protocol - 20K**

**Unhollowed Boneforge - 25K**

**Golem Foundry - 30K**

**Archive of Flesh - 30K**

**Empyrean Core - 35K**

**Tower of the Shattered -35K**


**You can deviate from this by about 2K HP depending on how geared your healer is and if you are running support**

So as you can see

you will not be able to get these HP numbers without runing your gear!

**Gleaming Adamant Rune

On the bright side, your rings and your neck peice, sometimes your ranged slot is hard to fill with a tanking item if it does not drop.  On these occasions fill it with the highest level DPS item you have, **Endurance&gt;ALL** stat wise if your not running a tanking item.

Now that we have talked about gear
This is going to be very general as this is not a guide for specific tank classes. If you have questions regarding specific tank classes feel free to ask, and rogue tank so can address anything specific that you want to know.  

But you want to make sure you have your basic damage mitigation abilities on cool down and always up.  Your big ""oh crap"" shields and self heals you want to save during phases where the healer needs time to catch-up and you anticipate a big hit.  Remember

Remember, and interrupt most of all.  Also, if you are getting low on health and out of cool downs to use, kite the boss if the healer is behind!  Sometimes delaying one or two auto attacks from the boss can make the difference between life and death.

I hope this helps those who are tank aspirant seeking to do good in their roles!  Tanks are lacking in queue and hopefully this will go someways in assisting those interested!

Once again, feel free to post and ask.

**EDIT: Hey guys/gals! I'm thinking of doing another clinic similar to this one except for maybe alittle more detail with some more specifics.  What are you interested in? DPS? class specific play? raiding? PVP healing? Let me know in your comments and I'll see if I can accomodate,False,self,t5_2s4an,1376594787.0,riftpve,,t3_1kf6t5

A number of players have helpfully [listed the coordinates](http://rift.junkiesnation.com/2013/07/25/summerfest-2013-storm-legion-new-content-guide/)

I decided to look at how to tweak the Addon TomTom [[via Curse](http://www.curse.com/addons/rift/tomtom)] [[via RiftUI](http://www.riftui.com/downloads/info353-TomTom.html)].

In version 2.2

    \RIFT\Interface\Addons\TomTom\Tomtom_Summerfest.lua    

So what I decided to start doing is converting coordinates that I find on the forums and add them to this file.

    { --Morban

        locations = {

I am not to new MMO's and know that 60 is when the game just starts and the grind is just starting.

My question is:  After hitting 60 I felt a little lost on what I should be doing at this point.  

I was hoping that some of the more experienced players could shed some in depth light on what I should be accomplishing daily in game now that I am 60.

Rep grinds - what ones?  For what items?

Raid rifts?

Are there daily raids/dungeons?  Where can these be picked up?

Random que for SL experts or classic experts?  Which one?

Any and all information on what I should be or what YOU do every day in game to help min/max for late game 10/20 man raids/mounts/ect.

2) Find yourselves trapped in a valley with armies of undead abominations pouring down upon you. Call upon the power of the Vigil to bolster your resolve and single-handedly butcher wave after wave until at last you and your friend are overwhelmed and killed. Watch in awe as a tide of planar beings washes over the valley and slaughters the friendly NPCs

3) Respawn and try to retake a smaller outpost instead. Be attacked on the road by a pair of cowardly Defiant hoping for easy kills. Look on helplessly as your friend succumbs

4) Charge to the contested area where dozens of undead lie in wait. Expend a planar charge to shoot a flare into the sky

5) Realize that all of this happened in the space of about fifteen minutes.

Pros:

*friendly and not so friendly competition between Guardian and Defiant Reddit guilds.

*easier to advertise stuff for trade here on reddit

*form interguild raid groups for times when your regular group cant/doesnt run. 

*could arrange pvp battles between groups (not sure how possible it would be in warfrons with the current setup)

*other benefits I havnt thought of.

Cons:

*really doesnt offer that much use.

*too much to coordinate

*the arguements for this arnt really all that good

*this wouldn't last that long since as more people join the sub-reddit the will already be on another sever

*something else entirely

Clearly there would still have to be two servers PvE and PvP

Thoughts?

I suppose there would be four servers: 

*North American PvP

*North American PvE

*EU PvP

*EU PvE

Now you're asking, watching streams is actually really helpful. You have immediate interaction between the broadcaster, who usually has great knowledge of the game and can explain to you easily, and you also have other viewers who are willing to help you learn. While watching and asking questions, you're also learning mechanics of whatever the streamer is doing. Things like Expert Dungeons or Raids, you watch and learn the fights, as well as other things.

I think there's an untapped resource the Rift Community isn't using

After I found [this thread's comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/uiglk/just_resubbed/)

I'm level 11 right now, there were two problems: participation, and travel.

One of the first Rifts may have been a mandatory primary quest dealie, but not a single player in sight, so I had to solo them.
Is this just because I'm in the very early levels?  Does this improve later on?  Are the Rifts worth visiting at the higher (or maxed) levels?

Secondly is travel.  I asked the /4 (Level 1-29) chat a simply innocuous question: 

*""Getting around is tough. At what level can I use a mount?""* 

I was met with some responses

*""You can mount at level 1.""*

Well

*""Well

*""Level 1""*

It almost turned into an Abbott &amp; Costello skit before someone finally informed me:

*""You need 2p50g""*

I'm still really new to this game

*""Is that 250 gold or 2500 gold""*

*""2p50g""*

Ugh. 

So I proceed with my questing
[Here's what was inside](http://i.imgur.com/EPVLn.png)

Sure, one guy healing the damage taker and everyone else maxing out their DPS but more a focus of everyone using all their abilities at their maximum potential to help the group as a whole to win whatever content they're trying to do, be it PVP or PVE. The main tank is getting whacked too hard? stun/squirrelize/kite one of the mobs away from him to give him a chance to recover. The main healer just got killed? hope that one of your teammates have a backup healing ability. A saboteur is stacking charges on an ally? remove the charges with a debuff.
With the Parser gaining more and more popularity i'm afraid this is just gonna end like WoW where players are only judged solely by the amount of DPS/HPS they can pull out and discredit those who sacrifice HPS/DPS for support abilities that make whatever content the group is trying to beat (such as interrupting spellcasting, shielding key members, etc) much easier and the content getting run smoothier.

And please. Oh please I beg you, Mages can do a very potent healing job and Clerics can do a superb tanking job.

The system has a pretty rigid conclusion of which trees do what.  If you mouse-over the soul icon you will see the classification whether the tree is considered a soul for Healing, or Support.  Now it doesn't matter whether your support tree is giving you the ability to heal, or whether your tank tree is giving you damage increases, the only thing that matters is the base soul classification.

It boils down to this

For example the mage tree Chloromancer is labeled as a Healing soul.  However

Now if you have 2 Defensive souls and you are splitting points in them

It would be nice to have a list of what all the trees are ACTUALLY classified as.  The trouble is I believe the queue takes multiple roles into account when determining your elegibility

MY BUILDS:
In an expert dungeon, or heal as chloromancer.
My builds are centered around damage

First off is my damage build (Necro/Lock/Dominator):
http://rift.zam.com/en/stc.html?t=1zwvs.xtczVdkds.cfRhkVqxk
I chose this build because it competes for the highest damage


My healing build (Chloro/Lock/Dominator):
http://rift.zam.com/en/stc.html?t=1zRvs.xdIuaVczoo.beohzVqxo
Unconventionally


WARLOCK:
If paired with Necromancer

Maximizing DoT and AoE damage revolves around timing. DoT’s deal initial damage and tick every 2 seconds. If a DoT is recast immediately after a tick, and then cast Devouring Shadows. Immediately after the first tick (2 seconds from initial cast), recast a new Devouring Shadows. If done effectively, you will double the damage of your devouring shadows by having it tick twice every two seconds.

Opportunity - This ability does not increase damage or damage per second. While it is great in PvP and may increase spike damage shorty, is longer than a 1.5second cast.
In short

Lingering Pain - This ability is a huge damage increase. Instead of refreshing Life Leech by recasting it and dealing no damage

Neddra’s Torture - Effect works on pre-existing DoT’s on the target. It does not have to be cast prior to DoT’s.

Draining Bolt deals more damage than Void Bolt and can be cast while moving. It’s worth getting - but not for the heal.

Neddra’s Grasp is not worth casting in most fights because enemies do not use abilities fast enough. It is only used in conjunction with Dark Touch and Radiate Death for AoE damage.

Shadow Life - Jargon aside

Radiate Death - This can be used as a quick way to refresh both Neddra’s Touch and Dark Touch by casting only one spell. It can be used on bosses if the boss is spawning additional enemies.

Both Dark Power and Improved Warlock Armor count as 10% flat damage increases.


NECROMANCER:
Symbiote is worthless. It causes your pet to heal you for an extra ~35 health per hit when Essence Link is active. It does not affect the heal reduction on Essence Link.

Soul Purge has a higher Damage per second than Void Bolt, heals you and your pet, and I believe counts as a DoT for Neddra’s Influence talent damage buff. Use it!

Skeletal Zealot is the highest damage pet. Unless the boss is going to kill it with aoe

You can name your pets by clicking their names in the portrait.

Necrosis greatly affects pet damage. Keep it up at all times. Use Looming Demise in conjunction with normal rotation on bosses.

CHLOROMANCER:
The highest healing rotation is to cast Nature’s touch
Natures Touch → Vile Spores + Ruin
Natures Touch → Vile Spores + Radiant Spores
Natures Touch --&gt; Vile spores + Withering Vines
If you always cast Radiant Spores after Ruin

If the tank needs an immediate heal and Nature’s Touch is almost done casting

Using Choke (warlock silence) on spellcaster enemies during a pull can be very helpful for your tank.

When casting Bloom and the mana bar drops by about 10%

Always buff Lifegiving Veil as your last buff. Dispels work on a “first on, always dispel a chloromancer in pvp, because unless they have read this, Lifegiving Veil will usually come off first. I recommend recasting it in PvP once you have allies buffs on you so it is less likely to be purged.

Natural Conversion does not take away the damage of the spell being cast but heals it up afterwards.

Destructive Growth is useless. It is a small area 10% damage boost for 12 seconds every two minutes on a spell dependent on charge. Use the spell more strategically for it’s heal and place the two talent points elsewhere.
Unless in a raid environment (and even then)

Sacrifice Life: Damage triggers Circle of Life’s effect (Increased critical strike chance of Bloom and Flourish).

Call of Spring affects all heals

Lifegiving Veil does proc greater essences and trinkets that heal over time or shield allies. The epic quality essences paired with superior (blue) quality essences stack

If you are afflicted by a reduced cast time debuff (rogues

Many people do not pick up Essence Surge despite getting 32 points in Chloromancer

If Stream of Reclamation or Corrosion are cast while Entropic Veil is active

Almost every other boss in an instance debuffs the tank with a dispellable DoT. Work it into your rotation after a Nature’s Touch cast and greatly reduce healing required. Note: some bosses cast more than one debuff. Find out which is dispellable and watch several impossible bosses become farmable.

I've been concentrating on running 56-60 dungeons to get gear for experts. It is going very slow but I'll pick up a piece a run usually thanks to the cache. 


I crafted what items I can that I knew would be worth it. 


I ran around closing rifts to pick up some new lesser planar essences that I still needed to update from lvl 50. 


I know there must be gear to get with Infinity Stones. I am picking them up all over the place with the daily quests I run into in the lvl 60 zones. I haven't figured out where to spend them yet. Any idea where these can be spent and for what? 


Any others that I missed? 



**EDIT:** Based on some of the guides posted I went ahead and started looking at my gear and what was available in the AH.

*So we all know by now Rift went free to play. With it came the ushering in of the games Rex Store. Rex Exchange better known as Rex to the community. REX is an item that can be purchased with real money

*Credits are what the store actually uses as currency. Rex which you can buy turns into 1250 credits. Credits you can buy directly if you wish but can't be traded like Rex can in the auction house. So say if you want the entry level cheapest credits 5 dollars will get you 750 credits.If you would like to go for a bit more the next level is 20 dollars for 3250. 

*The prices for the items in the store seem right on point. A few things make you say dafuq why is this that expensive? But in all a good job was done on pricing. Now at first glance looking at everything with a wide eye. I was like wow they put every damn thing into the store. And I was like mg! When I see an item say ""Chance at relic"" I'll address that right now.

*The one and only thing I don't like in this store. Is the fact you can even have a chance at a relic. Some things should be sacred in games. Legendaries even at chance should never be purchased in my opinion. You take the luster and achievement off of them by doing that. Granted the relics suck I think they shouldn't even be called that. It's just my opinion however. And I know it's just a business move to generate sales.

*That aside this is the most in depth

*The sheer number of armors and looks at your fingertips is a nice touch. Makes it close to impossible beyond you're one lazy sob. To never look just like the next person standing next to you. Close to 200+ armor sets you can buy via the Rex/Credit system. Means Rift probably has the most deep armor customization on the market.

*Trade Skills on the store pretty much almost every mat is up there. Doesn't mean you should go crazy it's still better for you to farm it. But just in case you're struggling to farm a certain thing. Or just don't want to run all over the zone for one item. You can use this as a quick fix.

*As far as the mounts pets and Dimensions. You can preview everything so you will never have a noob purchase. The preview everything was big for me because you couldn't always do that before. In all I think this store was extremely well made and should do well for the game. Let it out what you think. Also let Trion know if you found any imbalances or bugs.

I was so enthralled with this that I even asked questions myself (and I definitely will pay it forward), text-based MUDs because you normally get laughed at, called a ""fag"" or get no answer at all.

1370539096.0,1fsvsh,Some Experiences From a Returning RIFT Player,Riizu,20,3,15,"Hey /r/Rift!

First off

I thought it'd be nice to return the favor and include some things I had learned since returning about two weeks ago. I'll keep it in simple bullet point format

* Souls - If your coming back

* Abilities - Trion has added a wonderful sorting system to abilities. When you open your spellbook (p) you'll see things like ""Charge Consumers""

* Leveling - Ultimately, grinding, PvP, Instant Adventures, or Crafting, explore all your options.

* End-game - Currently, but one thing I have noticed is that I don't feel in a rush to reach end-game. I'd like to be there, but questing has been incredibly fulfilling, and things like zone invasions are just as exciting as ever (case in point, a Stillmoor invasion that took close to an hour to complete and involved a giant robot, abombination-zombie, and lots of deaths).

* Cairns and Puzzles - In case you haven't heard of these, rare-quality or higher piece of gear, experience, and usually a title. Cairns on the other hand are caches hidden around the world with gear. Once all have been found, you will also receive an achievement. Use these as ways to supplement your leveling gear, as well as break up your questing.

* Zone quests - For the most part, their will be something more elaborate, but keep an eye out for the story quests (characterized by a yellow background). I recently completed the Unseen questline, and it was incredibly rewarding watching a story unfold from level 10 to level 50. Also, Iron Pine Peaks presented a strong level of frustration for a completionist like myself. About 10 quests keep me from the finished achievement, and they seem to be impossible to find, or are designed to appear as you gain levels later on (I returned at 50 to find a couple that would prep the story for Storm Legion).

* Zone Progression - For those who are unaware

* Mentor Levels - Mentoring is an excellent system for helping new players as well as completing under-level content while still receiving relevant experience. Right-click on your player portrait and select ""Set Mentor Level."" Zones are often gated though

* Instant Adventures - Press (.) and you can queue up for instant adventures at any time. They will port you to the relevant location, and rewards.

* Channel 4, 1-29 chat is INCREDIBLY full with new players, but it suffers from Barrens chat syndrome. I won't go into this too much, just know it isn't representative of the entire community, and can easily be removed (/leave 4). I started to see an improved experience immediately in Level 30-49, though the occasional troll would show up if people seemed to be having too good of a time.

* Random dungeons/Warfronts/Etc - RIFT does have a LFG system for finding groups for dungeons, or instant adventures. The daily randoms for warfronts and dungeons should be of particular importance though, as you will receive a gear bag afterwards with vastly improved rewards.

* Storm Legion at 48 - Come level 48, this is a crashed ship that you will receive a notice for as well) you can get storm legion costume gear and further breadcrumbs for storm legion.

1306860703.0,hoc2n,Should the developers change the way augments show up on items?,comfort_eagle,20,2,12,"(I posted this on the official forums

Currently the only changes augments make on how an item appears is the name (ex: ""Blessed"" Faith-Forged Helm is the name given when saintstone is added to Faith-Forged Helm)

It is difficult to tell, and how powerful the augment is. Any rarity level of saintstone added to a crafted item changes the name to ""Blessed __,"" whether the augment is green or epic. 

You can tell how much the stats have been increased by comparing the item to one that is augmented. Normally this consists of searching a database site like rift.zam and doing some subtraction. However, it is an unnecessary hassle to find out which exact augment is used. 

A simple solution will be to make augments appear just like runes. For example

Using an epic augment would appear similarly

This change would make it much easier to see how much an augment affects an item, save for a stat difference (which may not be apparent unless you have another item to compare it to), it is almost worthless to add an epic augment to a crafted item, if you intend on selling it. 

Another suggested change: Augments should no longer change the name of an item. Right-clicking an item from your bag to search for it in the auction house will only return results crafted with the same type of augment, database sites end up with cluttered results, as shown [here.](http://rift.zam.com/en/search.html?q=faith-forged+helm) Another (far from gamebreaking, but worth mentioning) downside is the game ends up with items with names like ""Rugged The Wall.""

Clerics, a lot of people have been trying it out and coming by for spec advice.  What I'll give, here, is a brief spec progression up until level 31 along with some tips.  I don't have the particular motivation to get into great detail (right now), but, if you have any questions or suggestions for other specs, comment away!  I'll reply.

Brief summary to help explain the choices - Inquisitor will be our main tree.  Soul Drain is an extremely effective AoE skill.  When combined with Fanaticism and followed up with Circle of Oblivion, comes from what to do before you unlock CoO.)  The problem here is that Soul Drain has a 10 second cooldown, which means we have no spamable AoE - Cabalist to the rescue!

Combining these two trees gives us solid AoE for small groups (3-5).  Now, bring some nice DPS enhancement.  

__________________________

Anyway

&gt;-Level 10: http://rift.zam.com/en/stc.html?t=00jdo..VLz.c (still stuck with single target killing here

.

&gt;-Level 16 (15 is still rather dull): http://rift.zam.com/en/stc.html?t=00jdo..qxkb.V0z
Things are getting fun now.  Vex will heal you.  Soul Drain and Obliterate will destroy AoE packs.

From this point

-Vex 3 mobs (melee

-Soul Drain

-Decay (Ima chargin mah lazer)

-Obliterate

-Bound Fate


Then use instants to finish anything that may be left standing.  Shouldn't be much.

Now, buffs, instant damage.

At 31

I would
&gt;http://rift.zam.com/en/stc.html?t=00jdo.V0x.yxkbMx0az

Now, the 3rd tree becomes highly preferential.  Here are my top 3 picks for the 3rd tree:

1.  Purifier for the shield
2.  Justicar for passive survivability
3.  Cabalist for additional AoE/DoT DPS

Pick one.  Keep spending points in Inq and put the left overs into your third tree.

Rotation has changed, you spam CoO until Soul Drain can be used again.  Refresh Vex as necessary.

End-game AoEing build:
http://rift.zam.com/en/stc.html?t=00jdr.V0x.Exkigxzqz

Left over points go into 3rd tree of choice.

____________

A few tips:
-This build still allows for solid single target damage (needed while questing).  Rotation - Bolt of Depravity, Bolt of Judgement spam, with Depravity when Life and Death Concord procs.  Refresh DoTs if necessary.

-DoTs tick for their first tick of damage immediately upon application.

~~Hello Redditors and adventurers of Telara!~~

~~After some positive feedback in my previous post I have started the motion and brought back the Reddit Rift guild.
~~
~~**RiftIt** is the wonderful name chosen and at the moment the ~~charter is still in need of more signatures~~ The guild is now formed!!!!! **RiftIt** is now in motion!. 
~~
~~In the early stages, adventure, and friendship back into this amazingly under-rated gem of an MMO. A guild based around fun and experiencing all that this game has to offer, all while not being on your ass about raid times or what gear to wear and using this set of gear over that set.~~ 

~~I envision RiftIt to last long into the late stages of the game

~~RiftIt will be sure to cater to everyone's playstyles and needs for the philosophy of a happy player in a happy guild will lead to an amazing experience for one amazing game.~~

~~We accept everyone of all backgrounds, classes, levels, gear sets, play-styles, anything and everything! The only requirement is that you play Rift!~~ 

~~We are located on the scenic server of Wolfsbane US on the Defiant side.~~ 

~~If you wish to join or if you have any questions

~~I truly wish to see you all around~~


Edit 

~~**RiftIt** is now established!! The charter is signed and I'm slowly starting to grasp the power that is that of a Guild Leader hahaha. Going to make sure everything is going awesome and optimal and will see you all in game !~~ 

~~Oh yes and I forgot all along

1327625704.0,oyf1c,"Some suggestions for improving the /r/Rift community and experience, and increasing our membership",Dejime,18,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/oyf1c/some_suggestions_for_improving_the_rrift/

So I've been reading the threads of ""This subreddit is disproportionate to the amounts of players"" etc without a whole lot of discussion about how to do that

I respectfully disagree and have some proposals for both increasing the quality of content/discussion and the overall number of subscribers to /r/Rift. I'm going to make some proposals that I've come up with after a lot of thought and discussion with other Rift players in what they're looking for in a good community, probably not the ""normal"" subscriber, so maybe I'm looking for something different in a community. But I think this discussion needs to be had, even if the majority of /r/Rift ultimately ends up disagreeing with my assessment.

I think the major reason for the lack of meaningful content is a lack of controls/understanding in the community about what ""good content"" means. I think that high level content is ultimately best, even though most of the players in this sub may be casual. Other successful gaming subs are successful because even casual players feel like the content of the community makes them feel like they at least understand the game at a high level and could get to that level if they wanted to. Even if you're a casual player who has no interest in doing raids at a high level and just want to go through the content after it's exceptionally easy and you can breeze through it, content about the endgame gives you some level of insight into what the hardcore guilds/players do. It makes people be able to experience/understand parts of the game that they wouldn't otherwise see. This makes the community more valuable. Even players that aren't serious about this game can see and appreciate how high level content works. I am a member of sc2/LoL communities and while I'm probably an above-average player, I could never be a top level player, but I love seeing their explanations/theories/etc even though I could never really contribute to them or implement them. I think that high-level content interests even casual players (but maybe I'm wrong)

What would you think if you were an average level 50 player who logged onto /r/Rift for the first time? Would you stay? What would you think of the content? There's no reason to stay because it seems to be a lot of ""Should I get this game?"" or recruiting for ""Reddit Guild #237"". That might be really helpful for the individuals involved (the recruiting guilds or the player seeing assistance) but it's incredibly boring for the rest of us.

So what should be done about this? I have two types of proposals: Cleaning up/organizing repetitive/noninteresting content

First

Clearly there needs to be some ability for people to ask ""Hey, as the questions and answers change every so often as the game evolves and new content is added.  I think something similar could be done with ""What server should I join"" threads - just have a thread like that with general comments collected about some popular servers and where people should start.

I also think that recruitment on /r/Rift needs to be substantially changed and regulated. There are a ton of guilds that recruit on here and it's incredibly annoying, as the Rift Travel Shard forums are probably the places to go for that. At the very least I think that there need to be some controls, as I feel like this is the lowest level of content that contributes almost absolutely nothing to the community. 

Now about increasing the good content. How do I personally distinguish good content from neutral content from bad content? First, but little things like ""Did you know about the ""sell all grays"" button"" and little anecdotes in self posts I find to be borderline worthless. 

Neutral content is content that's cross-posted really widely around, but there would be no reason to be a part of the sub if neutral content was all that was here, as this neutral content is cross-posted on other community sites. 

Good content is the rest. It's content that is pretty high-level, and interesting to a majority of subscribers. As I argued earlier, content about the end-game (even just master mode dungeons, but especially raid content, content, from raid strategies to various build discussions to ""How to get the most out of this new patch's PvE changes/additions"" or whatever). It might give players something they can use or contribute to (new builds/suggestions on how to beat a boss they just can't/commentary about the current meta for certain classes, or whatever. 

So how do we get that content here? Admittedly those discussions are usually had on the official boards or more popular sites. That's obviously the difficult part. I haven't fully worked this out yet

Another suggestion for creating new, I enjoy watching other guilds raid to give suggestions, maybe learn a new strat or just enjoy the social interaction of the group. Periodically I see guilds say they're streaming, and that's great, but it's hard to find and often downvoted by people. I think it'd be a great idea to have a stream list topic that's listed in the sidebar, where a person who wants to watch a stream can click on the topic and see a list of streams, organized by time of general streaming or general content (E.g. Guild A, RoS/GSB, or whatever. I dunno how the community feels about streams but I feel like they're really interesting and it'd be fun to see other guilds and have a useful list to easily watch whenever we want. This is an easy way to ""create content"" and encourage people in the sub to see the ways that various guilds/players play.


***TLDR: There is too much bad content on this sub and not enough good content. I propose that to eliminate the bad content we come up with new restrictions on guild recruitment and have a single ""Should I get this game / Where should I roll / popular questions"" thread that is in the sidebar so that discussion doesn't get repeated several times a week. To create good content is less fleshed out, casual content, just running around, or whatever!

/r/Rift, and your own ideas! I want to see this community thrive like some of the other popular gaming communities around here, and I think serious modifications are needed to make this an interesting community that Rift players WANT to be a part of, because I just don't feel that way right now. Thanks for reading my massive wall of text. Please contribute to this thread, I'd love to see some real change come out of this, even if it isn't what I've outlined. I think this sub has to have a serious, frank discussion about what it wants and hopefully our combined heads can come up with some good ideas for improving the sub's content and subscribers!",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/oyf1c/some_suggestions_for_improving_the_rrift/

1296284345.0,fb81r,The defense of Scarred Mire. (AKA Why everyone should try RIFT),Shorvok,17,2,7,"First of all, on to the story.

I had played RIFT before in beta 2, I got much more interested in the game and I got a Paragon/Riftblade/Beastmaster mix to 13 (I can throw ice covered swords at people that light them on fire then watch as they are jumped by a pissed off tiger-thing). I had been questing in the actual world in Freemarch and I had participated in a few rifts and other things including assaults by the Guardians and destroying their footholds.

I had heard from a friend of mine over ventrilo who had gotten trapped in the Guardian's questing area that they were completely being taken over. There were multiple camps taken over by the forces of Regulos and he finally managed to get out of the mess by getting a GM to teleport him

About 20 minutes later a big message poped up saying the server was coming down in 30 minutes for an update. Right before, and not thought much of it because it was much higher level than me so I couldn't participate yet and the played seems to always win sooner or later.

Well this time apparently there weren't enough people participating in the even and they failed. Meridian fell and became a giant army spawner for Regulos. Armies poured out of the city and people started freaking out in the general chat. The first camps to fall were close to the city (keep in mind these camps are not just for these events or something

I was down questing at a place called Scarred Mire, just 8 players in a group and the NPCs of the camp against 20-30 mobs. The battle was intense, my pet died early on and I began to run out of endurance as the battle wore on. I slew 4 or 5 of the mobs, who were everything from armored void knights to skeletons that hurl fireballs. I happened to look around and noticed there were only 4 of us left, and most of the friendly NPCs were dead, but we were keeping them off the Wardstone (When a wardstone is destroyed the camp is either destroyed or transfers ownership to the faction that destroyed it). As I was just about to die I started getting healed by a Chloromancer that showed up, and a few more players joined the fight. I thought we might have a chance

I died shortly after we were reinforced, but just then the camp just to the northeast of us fell. Most of the mobs on the map that were fighting there started toward us, a force slightly smaller than the ones pouring into our area already. We were doomed.

To make it worse

We respawned and started trying to retake the came

We did lose the fight

It's not even that they will take over pre-designated areas or that they will do so much and stop then players can whittle them down. These things took over more and more and as they did they became more powerful. If the server hadn't went down they may have taken over the entire region

But that aside, but it was still probably the most fun I've had in an MMO since I played Everquest back before Luclin.

Since Rift went F2P it seems that a lot of new players (including myself) 
had quite a lot of questions regarding this game, like how the cash-shop works, 'what is loyalty and how much do I get for each purchase', 'What build is viable for my class' and 'what is the deal with these ""SL"" souls and how can I get them'. And i'm sure there are a lot of other questions like these people new to the game would like to know. Also I think the guide should just be on the basics/mechanics of the game because I think discovering new things is one of the best experiences in a MMO.

TL:DR Guide for new players stickied to this sub-reddit.


What do you guys think? I think the community (atleast on this subreddit) is great and I'm sure there are quite a lot of people who like to help new players out by making a guide.

I'd do this not only to placate the oceanic players themselves

They sit in the middle fighting while the enemy caps. The pick up the objectives and either run back to our spawn or stand in the middle fighting. As far I know there is no point to trying to get a good kill death ratio if your team is losing. The last match I was in someone was boasting about being the top of the dps chart. It didn't dawn on them that the enemy had capped all of our flags. They didn't budge from the hill. Obviously not even close enough to clear the flag area. 

This is a problem that most people have in warfronts. It seems that someone should take the initiative and try to train these people. I was thinking a short (very short) guide that someone can look at and figure out right away or maybe a 1 minute video. I know there are guides out there but really those are only useful to people serious about pvp and lets face it the bulk of the people out there right now are just testing the waters. If we want them to stay we have to actually make them useful.

1312296025.0,j6pyv,New to RIFT: my first thoughts,rbrumble,20,9,25,"Hi Reddit Rift community.  

I've been playing Rift for about a week now and I wanted to get some initial thoughts down to inform anyone considering checking this game out.  In a nutshell: try it!  It's one of the best games I have ever played

Musings from a former WOW player:

I'm another WOW refugee, I gave it up (again).  The way insta-que works now you can get from 10-cap without leaving your capital city.  Booorrrrrring....

Musings on Rift:

Graphics:

Compared with WOW, this would make a superior looking MMO.  Well, it was true, Rift makes WOW look like Warcraft compared with Warcraft 2.  The graphics are more realistic, with bigger models.  The detail on everything is impressive, from pets to clothing to spell effects.

Gameplay:

Again, the way quests are obtained and handed in, the satisfaction of levelling up is all a much more satisfying experience in Rift than it was for me with WOW.

World:

The world in Rift is much more interesting than WOW as exploration can be delayed by the appearance of one or more Rifts.  The additions to the game experience Rifts allow cannot be described.  Saturday night I was trying to get out of Sanctum to complete some quests, or help close the rift, than your world will fall.

Community:

Compared with WOW, and they always say hi and mentioned where saw each other last.  If I'm in trouble with a mob in Rift, and someone is near, they have always stopped to help.  In WOW, I was used to people walking/running past me while I died.  From the look of some of the guild names on my server (one of them is called the ""Ironforge"" something) there are more than a few WOW refugees on Faemist.  For those used to ""Barren's chat"" and all the DBaggery that goes on in world chat in WOW, I have seen none of this on Rift.  The player base appears to be more mature all-around.

PVP:

While I haven't done a ton of pvp in Rift, and I really need to spend more time with Rift to give a fair assessment of the pvp experience. 


These are MHO, they won't be disappointed.",,False,self,t5_2s4an,False,,
