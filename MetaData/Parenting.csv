1366465095.0,1cqncb,I read all the major books on baby sleep. Here is what I learned. (xpost beyondthebump),,1115,228,146,"A friend of mine

I went on amazon and bought all the top books on baby sleep and development. I read through them all

You shouldn’t sleep train at all, or before 4 months, but if you wait too late, your baby will never be able to sleep without you. College-aged children never need to be nursed, rocked, helped to sleep, so don’t worry about any bad habits. Nursing, singing, etc, stroller

Put the baby in a nursery, except that it can kill your baby, so never, ever do it. If your baby doesn't die, you will need to bedshare until college.  

Use the same cues as night: cut lights, but not too tightly. Put them on their back to sleep, but don't let them be on their backs too long or they will be developmentally delayed. Give them a pacifier to reduce SIDS. Be careful about pacifiers because they can cause nursing problems and stop your baby from sleeping soundly. If your baby sleeps too soundly, they’ll die of SIDS.  

Don’t let your baby sleep too long, even if they are waking up too early. If your baby wakes up too early, put them to bed later or cut out a nap. Don’t let them nap after 5 pm. Sleep begets sleep, so try to get your child to sleep as much as possible. Put the baby to bed awake but drowsy. Don't wake the baby if it fell asleep while nursing. 

You should start a routine and keep track of everything. Not just when they sleep and how long, and what you were doing before they slept. Have a set time per day that you put them to bed. Don’t watch the clock. Put them on a schedule. Scheduling will make your life impossible because they will constantly be thrown off of it and you will become a prisoner in your home. 

Using CIO will make them think they’ve been abandoned and will be eaten by a lion shortly. It also causes brain damage. Not getting enough sleep will cause behavior and mental problems, which is the most effective form. Extinction CIO is cruel beyond belief and the only thing that truly works because parents are a distraction. The Sleep Lady Shuffle and Ferber method are really CIO in disguise or Controlled Crying and so much better than Extinction. All three of these will prevent your child from ever bonding with you in a healthy way. Bedsharing and gentler forms of settling will cause your child to become too dependent on you.

Topping the baby off before bed will help prevent night wakings. When babies wake at night, your baby is manipulating you. Babies can’t manipulate. Babies older than six months can manipulate.

Sleep when the baby sleeps. Clean when the baby cleans. Don’t worry. Stress causes your baby stress and a stressed baby won't sleep.

So here is what happened:
Before I confronted him about his behavior, I know. I am not proud of how I did it however, I meant what I said. He left the house for a couple of hours after that. Did not speak to me for another two days until I confronted him. He told me that he had nothing to say to me since I believe that he gets some kind of joy from discipling our children. I told him that he had it all wrong. It was not JUST the discipline but how he treats them in general. I asked him why does he feel the need to treat his children like shit? He of course disagreed. Then I finally resulted to showing him my reddit post. Before reading it, he told me that ""people on reddit will agree with him because they are just as awesome as he is."" Needless to say, he was very shocked when he read the responses. He did not speak for a while and sat with his head in his hands. 

The next day, he did agree to looking for a therapist that he would feel comfortable with.

**I honestly believe that showing him what I posted on reddit and the responses I got back, to his kids. He did not want to be that father. He is not close to his father and he did not want that for his kids. Thank you guys so much for your honesty and helpful advice.

I made this account specifically because I just wanted to share an experience I had yesterday that really impressed me with the lengths a parent will go to for their child's happiness.

I'm currently in the Jersey City, I head back to the PATH train (or ""subway"" for any fellow out-of-towners haha) to begin the journey back to my hotel. 

As I'm awaiting the train's arrival, then out of nowhere about 100 bicycles and their riders in full riding apparel. Curiosity getting the better of me, I approach a girl nearby and ask what was going on. She informed me there was a big charity race of some kind that had been going on all day and they were now all heading home.

Curiosity satiated, nor did I see either of them holding on to a bike. I strike up a conversation with the father and ask if they were part of the race and if they had enjoyed it. The man just grinned and said that while they had watched the race all day, they weren't participants. I sort of stumbled for words at this point saying something along the lines of, ""Ah okay, I just assumed you guys were participants because of the helmets.""

Thinking our conversation at an end,

*""My son has suffered from a form of seizures all his life that cause him to sometimes lose consciousness. It can happen literally at any time. So since he was old enough to walk he's had to wear a special helmet to protect his head when he falls. He was fine with it until he first started school and some of the other kids were mean to him and poked fun. So I bought a bike we can both ride and usually take him to and from school with it. When the other kids try to poke fun

Life sometimes rarely seems to make sense and the loss of my son will always haunt me if i try to question it.

Last Thursday i received a frantic call from the wife that my son Dax was not breathing, even if he pulled through he would never be able to function as even a baby does. ""  However they did everything in there power to verify the horrible words of the doctor, less then 24 hours from then my sons kidneys were failing, completely dependent on a ventilator and blood pressure medicine. They gave us time to get family in to say our goodbyes and one final chance to hold our son in our arms.

Devastation would be the best way to put how we felt even with the support of multiple family members and our pastor we were struggling to even answer any questions let alone make one last final decision in our sons life.

We chose to allow the hospital through a program called life share take our sons heart for the valves in order to possibly give life to another in our darkest hour.

I never thought in my wildest dreams anything like this could happen to us, doing the things we cherish in life can never be quick enough but i promise you in a blink of a eye it can be too late. ",,False,self,t5_2qhn3,False,,

Don't read this if you can't be sad right now.,akrabu,621,119,188,"I have meant to share this with Reddit for a while. It is hard to type or think about even now but I feel like this is one of the things I have to do. It has been a month since we lost her. I can't explain how I feel about Reddit

Her name was Bloddueth. It is the name of the Welsh goddess of springtime and fertility. We are non-religious but we like Welsh names and thought it sounded pretty. She was the happiest and healthiest baby that ever lived. Well she was my cranky baby

I'm a stay-at-home-dad and Mommy was at work that day. She was really happy and really silly that evening. Blue, but kind of falling asleep while I had her on my lap playing with her. I texted my wife at work at 8ish to tell her that I felt bad keeping her awake because she is really sleepy, asking her if it would be cool if I put her to bed earlier than 9. Well I didn't wait for her response because I figured she would be okay with it. I had already put a lot of work into keeping her happy and awake so I just took her upstairs to her bed. We cosleep by default but Blue had a special toddler bed for naps because unlike my firstborn, she wouldn't sleep in my arms or in any room where people were doing things. So in a roundabout way she demanded her own sleep space. I took her up to her bed and she went to sleep the same way she always did when sleep was her decision. I set my phone alarm for 8:20 and when 8:20 came around I checked on her. She might have been dead at this point I am not sure. I just checked to make sure she was sleeping soundly and not squirming or fussing. She looked asleep at a glance so I set my phone for 8:40. I needed to set these alarms because she wouldn't necessarily cry out, but she had a fussy squirmy way of sleeping when she wasn't going to stay asleep that I needed to interrupt and fix so she could be sleeping when mommy came home from work. At 8:40 my other girl asked for a bath so I took her upstairs and started drawing a bath for her. I walked right by Blue to do this but when I came back to actually check on her something seemed off about the way she was sleeping. I took a step or two into the room and I knew before even touching her that she was dead. I tried and tried everything I could to bring her back. It took me I think 5 or 10 minutes to call 911 because time stopped and I just wanted my baby to be alive. I kept pumping on her chest and trying to get air into her lungs. I tried to make my phone work several times but I couldn't do it and I couldn't stop trying to keep blood going into my poor baby's brain. There was nothing wrong with her. She was just dead.

You never expect your child to just be dead for no damn good reason. But, don't talk to them. In fact, fuck those fucking scumbags! If your child unexpectedly dies I learned that the police will interrogate you and harass you. I'm not talking about the next day or anything. I'm talking about all fucking night long when you just want to be with your family. They won't let you in your house unless you sign their permission slip to investigate your house until 4 in the fucking morning. If you tell them to fuck off and go get a warrant, they will tape off your house as a crime scene until then and you are fucked even worse. They will try to convince you to pay out of your bleeding asshole for a polygraph test (interrogation) and they will generally turn your living hell into a waking nightmare. That's standard practice. We actually got off easy compared to some of the stories you can find. I just feel lucky that when CPS came, and they did, that they let my other baby stay with her parents, because we had a third-party supervisor (super-grandma came to stay with us.)

Anyways, IDK, maybe she inhaled some milk or some water at some previous time? We'll never know for sure. They tested the fluid and never really figured out what it was or what caused it.

The other thing you can never expect from losing a child is that everyone else wants to grieve too. They need you to be a part of it too. They can't be sad for the baby that they didn't lose, so so many people, but it still sucks. I had to give the news to so many people and watch them just die inside because for them, my beautiful baby just died regardless of how long I have been living with it. Also, everyone wants to help somehow. The only thing that would actually help is if your baby wasn't dead, and they all recognize the futility of trying to help and so do you. So it doesn't matter how utterly helpless you are, you have to pretend that there are things they can help with. 

After people stop trying too hard to save a day that is long gone, and then they abandon you. I get that too. Who the fuck wants to hang around people who are fucking sad to the extent that it wears off on you? Even if you pretend that you've moved on, it doesn't matter because they know you haven't. I can't handle my perpetual sadness so I avoid it as much as possible. But yeah no one else can handle the anxiety of hanging around with a person you expect to ball their eyes out any second either. I don't blame the plethora of people who care about us for avoiding us. I would be much more distant myself if this shit had never happened to us. 

Another thing life doesn't prepare you for is losing control of your emotions. Before losing my baby I was the master of my mood and my emotions were my bitch. Now I am either crazy fucking happy and desperate for human contact trying way too hard to pretend like nothing happened

There were some positive things. I don't want to talk about them because I hate the fuck out of those things because they never would have happened if my baby girl didn't die. 

I just want to hold her one more time, and don't fucking smell her hair, and kiss her head, or pat her on her cute little tushy again. Don't even look at your child if it's dead. You will never be able to forget that shit and you need to be able to remember the good stuff without all of that horrible getting in the way. You never hear anyone say, ""I wish I could remember how cold and lifeless my loved-one was."" 

I mostly wanted to type this up because I wanted to share some of the things that caught me by surprise

I know at least one person will read through all of my crap here. I'm sorry. I don't want anyone to feel bad but I just feel so fucking fucked right now and I have to talk about it with someone. I can't handle looking at any more empty dead eyes when I tell them that our wonderful girl is dead. My pain isn't unbearable

I lost track of what I was saying but one more awesome thing about Blue was that she was really strong. The day after she was born we figured out that she could hold on to my index fingers with her tiny hands and stand up. She was something to behold in a jumper.

There's a reason r/cutekids is a completely dead subreddits, at least a little.

Please can we open up a serious discussion on this

**[EDIT]** : 

Two great solutions have been put forward.


1- Create a bot that deletes every link pointing to imgur with a respectful suggestion to post them in /cutekids instead. Please see moderator /davidjayhawk's [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/161q0s/meta_all_right_folks_can_we_outright_ban_cute/c7s0auq)


2- Create a special day like Imagefest Friday (credit to u/miparasito for the idea) where such content is allowed and even encouraged. This could probably be enforced by a Bot though I actually have no idea.

Wooden. Puppet-like. Diagnosed with autism and given speech, but my oldest nearly died three years ago

The point of all this introduction? We've experienced, of anticipated grief, reached the moment where we've stopped sugar coating things for our eleven year old daughter and explained to her about death and what various people have to say about the afterlife. We've experienced the ""sure"" knowledge that our youngest will surely be disabled all her life and what the ramifications of that will be for her, for us, for her own children should she choose to have any.

In other words, mollified, terrified, and put through a wringer. And, sometimes in spectacular fashion, we've come out of the other end of the wringer and noticed that experts that tortured us with nightmare scenarios turned out to be wrong. That if you haven't done your own research, you can't rely on the advice of others who say they have. Maybe this is why my perspective on the nonsense that goes on at my children's schools seems to be so different from the other parents around me.

We live in a small town south of Hartford Connecticut, where twenty small children and six faculty members were shot to death by Adam Lanza. That shooting, I'm somewhat ashamed to say, affected me far more personally than any mass school shooting that preceded it. It was too close, for one thing. For another, I now have a small child of a similar, defenseless age. I can not and do not want ever to fathom what it must be like to hear from a frantic friend's phone call, or a town official, that your tiny child was one of the victims. I can think of no greater personal terror.

Nevertheless, I'm angered by what I find at my children's schools whenever I need to interact with the people there. Why? A couple of reasons, one of which is math. The other of which is the erosion of our communities and what used to be American culture.

Years ago when I would pick up my older daughter at elementary school, you'd hit the doorbell, present yourself to the camera, and after the school receptionist decided you were safe, the doors would buzz and you'd be let in.

In practice, probably around 2001, barely looks up at you half the time, and buzzes the door open. You, or someone else opens the door, and, around half the time, holding the door for one another. Multiply this process by ten if it's raining or snowing or bitterly cold. Do you know every parent of every child in your kids' school? Would you slam the door in the face of someone you didn't recognize? You may claim you would in the hypothetical

However, which is appropriate given the numbers, to likely-to-be-a-problem. It assigns every adult on the premises a higher-than-background level of presumed guilt. This is wrong. It's an erosion of community. If you think there is no profound psychological effect in being treated even superficially as a criminal or a prisoner, look up the Stanford Prison Experiment sometime.

A child raised to believe that a locked glass door on a school protects him from crazed shooters, or soon if things continue on the current trajectory, board a bus or a train. This despite the fact that the TSA has never caught a single terrorist, has never foiled a single plot, has never had a finding that led to a conviction of absolutely anyone. Quite the opposite, in fact. Every single internal audit that the TSA has ever conducted on themselves, they have failed. They have failed to detect simulated weapons and bombs and allowed them to pass checkpoints. Every time. Think about that for a moment. They have failed every test they've been given

Why do you allow your child's elementary school to be modeled as a junior prison? Checkpoints, man-traps at some schools even.

2.4 million people died in the United States in 2010. 16, all types of murder, using guns, poison, blunt objects, a push down the stairs, etc. Secondly, more than 3 times as many Americans died of the *flu* in that same time period. Only 0.6% of deaths in the US in 2010 were the result of homicide of any kind. That's less than one percent

Of those murders

Pour a swimming pool into a painter's bucket. Now pour the painter's bucket into a thimble. Now dump the thimble out on the ground. The moisture remaining in the thimble is a pretty good visual of the likelihood that your kid is going to be shot at school

To combat this non-threat, being absolutely quiet lest a hypothetical crazed mad man hear them.  In some districts, police officers roam the halls, banging on classroom doors and begging to be let in, to teach the students to remain hidden even under duress. Some have planned to go even farther and simulate the sounds of gunfire.

Do you think the maybe-subtle

When I went to school, my mom found me in class, never having even stopped at the office, when she needed to drop off my lunch, or some medication I'd forgotten, or to remind me that I needed to pick my brother up after school (no cell phones then, either). Nobody died as a result of this callous disregard for our safety

More people die from Alzheimer's Disease than from murder. More people die of diabetes. If it makes sense to lock your child's school in case of rampaging murderers

Then it hit me, ""holy shit, I just made a decision that will effect a human for the rest of its life and shes not even born yet"". I created a statistic. That week, she went into labor 3 months early. My beautiful little angel was born 2.4 pounds and could fit in my hand. Her face, changed my life in a flash. Im a father?!! I did not leave the hospital for 4 days, to never return.
    I was a father! But more than that, no matter what. I can love. I can be loved! Then the docs told me, she had some bleeding on the brain, Some ""development issues"" that could be permanent and a blood infection to boot. It wasnt looking good. Four days of Heaven stolen in one second.
     Three months later, that she had never in her 23 year career, seen a father so dedicated. I told her, ""Thanks, its the MOM in me!"". I was told my daughter could come home once she learned to take the bottle by herself. It would be a while but there was a light at the end of my tunnel. My amazing little girl took her very first bottle, the whole thing, by herself. PRIDE OVERWHELMED ME. I brought my little angel home that evening.
   In 2 weeks, I say thank you and pretend it's just my duty. When in fact, inside, another spark, ignites another flame and another reason to give these beautiful children another kiss and/or hug and thank them for saving my life. But more, for finally giving me something I succeeded at. For showing me that a father, is exactly what I was always meant to be.

School says all of the kids' anxiety went down and kids said they felt safer with the dads there.

Since, be playground monitors, door watching to make sure the doors are locked from the outside that should be, stuff like that.

We had a meeting at the school last night and apparently there are about 20 other schools nationwide doing essentially the same thing and our school is now implementing it as an official program. Dads can sign up for shifts and positions in the school on their days off and stuff. The school says that since this has started, no one's fighting in the halls, and when they sit with the kids that sit alone at lunch, other kids come and sit and the quiet kids are now participating in class way more.

I have offered to research the quantifiable and non-quantifiable benefits this is having and hope they take me up on it. Fathers

My son splits his time 50/50 between my house (me + my fiance) and his dad &amp; stepmom. My fiance and I sat him down last night and let him know that he wasn't in any trouble

He was very open and willing to talk. Went over the regular safe sex and internet things (like dangerous sites/unusual porn/etc). Turns out the kids at school had dared him to visit the sites and had been teasing him because he hadn't done it yet. 

This makes sense as he's still seemed fairly asexual to date. My fiance let him know that he could always come to one of us if he is curious about these internet sites or has kids teasing him/daring him to visit them

He also let my son know that when he's ready for ""material"" he'd help him find something suitable.

We also have a book on order he can read through on his own.

We have one two year old son named Roman and a nine month old daughter named Adelai. The appointment went on far longer than we had expected so I figured it would be best to waste some time with the kids. Food is always good. I walked the kids over to a Subway figuring I could grab a sammich and split it between the three of us. Our sammich was nearing completion when Roman grabbed his rear end and yelled

""It's alright

THE BATHROOM

I looked in vain for a clean place to put Adelai. The only option was the floor so I ripped off a few pieces of toilet paper and laid them on the floor. Perfect. I set her down and immediately turned my sights to Roman. 

""Let's do this!"" 

I pulled his shorts down and felt his butt to see if I could locate the rogue ""turd-le"". Confidence morphed into horror when my hand squished against his bottom. A quick glance only confirmed my suspicions. Diarhea. Why? I look back to see Adelai had started eating her toilet paper seat.

""Hey! Don't eat that!""

A six-toothed grin helped me realize that she wasn't planning on stopping. I then pulled Roman's Incredibles underwear down and plopped him on the toilet. He promptly started peeing and congratulating himself for using the potty. While Roman rejoiced at his own intelligence I scooped up Adelai and headed for the sink. 

""Roman

""Yeeeeeah."" Roman replied.

I filled the sink with hot water and hand soap and threw the underwear in. Making a claw out of my hand I started the wash cycle. My hand vigorously swooshed and swished the underwear in it's hot and soapy bath. Adelai was fascinated with the soapy mess and began to launch off of my hip into the ""washing machine"". I held tight and moved onto the rinse cycle.

""How's it coming back there

""Yeeeeeah."" Roman replied while staring at his feces-covered legs.

With the rinse cycle over I looked at the soaking wet underwear. Mr. Incredible had a brown goatee so I put them back in for more rinsing. After that rinse

""You done

""No. Still pooping. Not done.""

I entertained Adelai for a few minutes while I wondered if the ""artist"" was listening to any of this. Several minutes went by when I Roman let me know he was finished. I set Adelai back onto her paper seat by the door and I went to work cleaning Roman off. My eyes glance over my shoulder to an empty toilet paper throne. The girl was gone. She couldn't have gone far. My greatest fears are forming as I see two chubby legs behing the urinal partition.

""NOOOOOOOOO!""

It was too late. Behind the partition I find my nine-month old daughter with her lips firmly secured to the edge of the urinal. I yank her away and look at the urinal in discuss. There are yellow spots everywhere but where her mouth was fastened. There

""GYAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!""

I shook it free from her hand seconds before it reached her mouth. She was furious. I cleaned them both thoroughly in the washing machine/sink

""Cute kids.""

""Thanks

I smile and we enjoy our meal. Halfway through our meal together I was still smiling.

""I love both of you a lot.""

Roman growled in his monster voice

Adelai bit me which I considered a positive response.

I like being a dad because I used to go to Subway, eat, and leave. Nothing is that boring anymore. People tell me about how having kids ties you down. If having kids ties me down to a life where a simple snack at Subway turns into an excrement covered disaster, give me more kids. I love disasters. Twenty years from now I will have my kids and their friends laughing hysterically when I tell this story. Ten years from then I may be making my grand-kids laugh even harder while their mother blushes and rolls her eyes at the story she has heard ""hundreds of times."" I may have even made you laugh. I live for disasters like these and I hope you get to experience disasters like these too.

Don't give me solitude. Give me disasters.",self,t5_2qhn3,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yxnff/why_i_love_being_a_dad/

It got me to thinking of the things I used to do when I had toddlers in the house and I thought I'd share them here.  I hope someone finds them helpful.

* **Analog clocks are great for transitions.**  Even before my kids could tell time we made good use of the clock.  ""You can play until the big hand is at the bottom of the clock"".  Or ""Bedtime is when the big hand is at the top"".  Sometimes I'd put a post-it note on the clock face.  ""When the hand is on the yellow square, I got a lot more cooperation I think because it was like they were telling themselves it was time.

* **Take turns instead of Sharing**  My son was the one who gave me the most fits about sharing.  He hated to share.  But I found that he was much less adverse when I'd say he needed to take turns.  I think he thought sharing meant he had to give something up but take turns sounded like he'd get another chance.   

* **Give a specific number of things to put away when cleaning up** When we are not doing our usual chores and I want a quick tidy I still do this with my teens.  I tell my three kids, so we had to make a rule that smaller things needed to add up to the size of a loaf of bread to count.",,False,self,t5_2qhn3,False,,

It turns out all three of them were very easy infants. At the time I thought they were hard work. Hard but manageable. Crying. Pooping.  Sleeping. Pooping. Crying. Sleeping. Etc. 

They were tough but manageable. I never hit a point where I thought I would lose it. I think 10 or 15 minutes was the max any of them cried before they stopped. And when they went to sleep after their 10 minutes of crying

I thought it was tough. Tough but manageable. Particularly when the 3rd one came. ""Look at me. I'm managing two toddlers and an infant.""

Parents who complained about how hard their baby was - I'm ashamed to admit, you can do it with an infant. It's tough. Sure. But manageable.

Tonight my wife and I babysat my friends' infant. He's five months old. His mum and dad are friends of my wife and I

""Just deal with it

""He's gonna be a lot of work

My god. He screamed. For 4 hours. Huge desperate screams I've never heard in my life. His body would stiffen as he drew in his breath. His lungs would fill and he would relax slightly

My wife rocked him. And patted him. And laid him down and tried to let him sort himself out. We put on lullabies

I started to seriously worry. What if there is something really wrong with him? I could feel my stress building. And he kept screaming. Louder and louder

I called his mum. ""I think there's something seriously wrong with him. He's screaming in pain. I think he might be really sick.""

His mum could hear him through the phone.

""No. He sounds the same as every night. He screams like that for 5 or 6 hours a night. Usually

I had no idea. I would have snapped. Honestly, constant screaming every night - how do people not snap?

He fell asleep at about 10:00pm

She's got maybe an hour or two of sleep before that screaming starts again. I simply can't imagine that. Every day. Every night. Every day. Every night. Again and again and again.

I don't know how parents of difficult babies do it. All I can say is you are absolute heroes. I've told her to send him around whenever she needs a break. My wife and I can handle the occasional disrupted night. At least it might give our friend some time to recoup.

My oldest daughter (8) is over at her friend's house, her other cat got hit by a car just before Christmas last year. She was devastated. Her birthday was this past June, and her best friend (the one who's house she is at right now) had a cat who had just had kittens. So, she gave her one, the best of the litter. We've had him for 4 weeks (he was 12 weeks old on Saturday), but in that time we've all built such a bond with him. He was such an awesome cat. He greeted you at the door when you came home, he killed any fly that managed to make its way into the house, and he would come running to her if she walked into the room. My husband hates cats, sweetest

My youngest daughter, playing. I checked on her and she was fine, just watching tv and playing in her room. I went downstairs to clean the kitchen. I was down there for about 10 minutes when my daughter came up to me timidly and said ""I'm so sorry...he stopped breathing. His heart isn't working."" I knew before I asked who she was talking about and I bolted upstairs, asking her where he was. She told me the doll baby crib. :( (She had put him in there to try to make him better... ugh...) I grabbed him and he was limp. And here is where my horrible, horrible mom moment came in. I was so distraught and shocked I held him out to her and said ""WHAT DID YOU DO?! WHAT DID YOU DO?!?"" I'm sick just knowing I said that to her. He was dead. My husband walked in the door at that moment from work. I was crying and screaming (I swear, I've never pictured myself this way) and I thrust the cat into his arms and said ""FIX HIM! PLEEAASE!! FIX HIM!!"" He tried to calm me down and took the cat (doing CPR the whole way) to the animal hospital down the street. Before he left he yelled at me (rightly so) to go take care of our daughter, that she was scared.  The whole time I had been so upset about this cat that I had vilified her and let her alone screaming and crying in her room. I feel wretched. 

I went to her and I held her. I told her I forgive her. She kept apologizing. I asked her what had happened. She told me that she had put him under a bucket sat on it

We're not supposed to pick up my other daughter from her friend's until later this afternoon. I don't know what to tell her. I definitely do NOT want to tell her it was her sister's fault. I'm right in that, however small, and I don't think she'll ever be able to get over it. I'm afraid the youngest might say something, because she might want forgiveness from her sister. I'm hoping she doesn't. 

I...honestly, help. 

EDIT: Thank you so much for all of the kind words and thoughtful advice. You're all helping me more than I thought possible. I really appreciate this. 

**UPDATE- Talked to my oldest**: Thank you to all of you (parents and non-parents) for your advice, and I will be dealing with that guilt for the rest of my life. I'm not a bad mom. My daughter is not a serial killer. She's been alive for 4 years and 1 month. She does not understand death like any of us adults would. Of course she doesn't. Although, unfortunately, she does understand much more now. She and I have talked and she's expressed sorrow and shame and has asked for forgiveness. Such a horrible range of emotions that I wish she hadn't have had to experience at such a young age. But she did. And we're coping. I did not realize the kitten had gone upstairs. He typically stays downstairs. He had been playing with the dog in full view of me while I was cleaning the kitchen. He must have run upstairs and then everything happened within the 7-10 minutes that he had been up there. She's not a malicious child. She's always been sweet to him. I don't think she knew that she was killing him, she doesn't understand oxygen or that the lack of will kill a living being. I don't normally let them be alone together, because, yes, and for that I am more sorry than you could all even possibly understand. 

I'm very thankful for the understanding people in this world. And even for those who would set me straight. It was an accident, this wouldn't have happened. She is...quite honestly, an amazing child. She cried, she was incredibly distraught, but she cupped my face in her hands, wiped my tears as I wiped hers and she said ""Mommy, I'm so sorry you saw that and that you and daddy went through that."" I asked her if she was upset with her sister. I told her it's ok if she is, I'm not mad at her. She didn't know. I'm really, and an amazing big sister. 

Thank you to those who told me to tell the truth. If I hadn't, forgiving sister my youngest has.

First of all

Swim lessons are a great way for your child to become more comfortable in the water

In a class of 5-10 kids, the less 1-on-1 time your child will be receiving. 

Therefore

If it comes down to it, drowning has become somewhat of a spectacle. Movies and TV shows commonly portray drowning as a sort of dance one might do to prevent death. However drowning victims are going through a pre-determined set of motions in order to keep themselves alive. [**This is a drowning victim**](http://youtu.be/L0KTqPloUiU?t=27s). [This is not](http://youtu.be/Es4Esox8roo?t=3m32s).

Finally

Children: 
&gt;1) Check Airway: Raise chin and search mouth for objects

&gt;2) Check Breathing: Put ear up to mouth

&gt;3) Check Circulation: Place two fingers below jaw

If pulse but no breathing

If no pulse/breathing, full breaths that should make the chest rise.

I hope you learned something

And over the top of it all was Mozart at a kabillion decibels.

My daughter has strabismus (cross eyes) and she has been diagnosed very recently. It wasn't exactly easy to see that she has a problem since something she would look fine and other times not... So anyway, it started to show less and he mentioned many times that he was very happy that her eyes were fine. 

Fast forward to recently when she got her diagnosis, they simply said ""she'll look ugly and she will look sick."" That frustrated me and I told them how I was upset at them, how I am grateful she can see and that thanks to today's technology her eye sight problem has good chances of being cured and that I am very proud of her. I then left while my aunt was sobbing. 

I went with my daughter to pick up her glasses and she looks ADORABLE (as usual). So I took a picture and sent it to my sister. Eventually it got to my mom and she showed my aunt. Instead of saying ""oh she's cute"" or not say anything

I honestly don't know how to deal with that... I cannot believe their reaction. You know what REALLY bothers me? In the family, my mom and myself all wear glasses! 

How would you approach this situation/ would you even approach it? 

Update: After reading every single response (so far) I want to thank you all very much. I knew what my family thought was wrong and that it was stupid but it feels good to know that I am not over exaggerating and that it is really ridiculous. I still have no idea what to do. Luckily

Anyway, just get a good husband."" So I definitely don't want my daughter to be exposed to these comments and this way of thinking. 

You guys were a great help... Thank

I caught a glimpse of something out of the corner of my eye and when I turned I saw the same drawer I just closed slide back open slowly. Now we live in a very old house and its not uncommon to hear weird noises at night. My paranoia was kicking in but I shrugged it off as me being crazy and closed it once more. I took a step back and kept a close eye on it. I watched in horror as it again
 At this point I was getting pretty scared. I ran out of the kitchen and went to check on the kids in the living room. My youngest was nowhere to be found! I'm not one to really believe in ghosts but being alone with the kids at night in a big old house can make your imagination run wild. I called her name, it slowly closed by itself then started slamming open and shut, open and shut. I was about to cry until a little leg slid out of the cabinets underneath. My 2 year old emerges from the cabinet under the drawer. She just looked at me and smiled and ran off, back to the living room. Somehow she snuck in, climbed in the cabinet without me realizing, and was playing with the drawer from underneath. Boy, was I relived.

I work as a server at a Chili's and tonight I had a table with a dad and a little boy (no older than six years old) and he was so well behaved and it was a pleasure serving the two of them. The little boy ordered his own food, however, had three screaming kids (and I'm talking like a three, five, and ten year old) who were rude, disruptive, running down the isles

Since I am not legally allowed to ask the parents at the one table to start parenting and stop disrupting everyone else, I showed him a picture of my dog, and I felt like I did a really good thing because I remember when I was a kid, I was well-behaved and remember that the 'bad kids' always got the most attention because people were trying to shut them up. I just wanted to reward a good kid and a good dad.

Here's what happened in a Gertrude Hawk Chocolate store on Friday (this is my email to them):

*""Good morning.  I am writing to inform you of a very unfortunate incident that occurred in your Colonie Center (NY) store on Friday evening (August 2).  I have two small sons, my older son and I walked into the empty store and asked the clerk if there were any samples.  (My son loves routines and rituals.  Whenever we see one of your stores we HAVE TO do the following: ask for a sample, try it, then purchase a box of Smidgens or fruit slice jellies to use as positive behavior rewards for the boys).

I was asking after samples when my husband walked in with our younger son.  He (our 3 year old) was crying because he fell.

The employee asked, ""If I give you extra samples, will you get them out of here?""  

I assumed that she was having a bad day, when the clerk came over, said, ""Here!"", and shoved about a dozen chocolates hastily wrapped in a square of bubble wrap into my hands.  She then ordered us to leave the store - despite the fact that we had done nothing wrong, and both children were now quiet (the eldest having not been upset in the first place).

I smiled for the benefit of my children, and my husband and I left with our children.

It was humiliating.  

To compound the humiliation, because we weren't welcome in that store.""*

* Go to the [New](http://www.reddit.com/r/preteen_girls/new/) section everyday and downvote all submissions to oblivion. For this

* Feel free to post there and make their lives miserable. They say they have free speech

The usual mantra doesn't apply here because
When it received little publicity, brought it down.
Some subreddit were created after that, and so that Reddit management realizes that we don't want this content here.

This appears to be the first time he's done this. He's almost 11. We'd closed the door while he was doing homework because his younger brother was pestering him. What we're doing about it:

1. The computer is being moved to the common area. This was already on our agenda
2. An adult must be able to see what's on the screen whenever he uses it.
3. We're going to tell him that we're aware he used the computer for non-school purposes (at a time he was supposed to be doing homework) and that it was sexual in nature.
3. We're also going to explain why the internet is not a good source of information about sex. That most of what you find is not how two normal adults have sex and we want to make sure that he has good information.
4. Then we're going to let him know he can talk to us if he has questions

* I had to get a paternity test done for some administrative stuff
* I've been there with her since the day she was born
* The mother knows who the father is
* I've been the one paying for her daycare and pretty much everything except her food.
* Her mom is flat broke.  She lives with her parents
* I am an active duty Marine
* I'm 23

Edit:

* My name is on her birth certificate


Reddit, especially with a person like her mother.  I want to retain my legal rights to visitation and anything else, and it was suggested that I seek legal guardianship. I really can't go forward with seeking adoption, and there's no chance of just ignoring this like it never happened.  I'm going to be setting up an appointment with an attorney, but I need to know what else I should be doing right now.  My family mentioned the possibility of fraud on her mother's part for never mentioning the other potential father, and even though I don't want to seek any damages directly against her, I would like to know if this is something I should be discussing. My whole world is literally in shambles


I need some advice on who I should be talking to, but in the mean time I could really use any advice that you have for me.  I'm probably going to pass out for the night after this, but I will clarify anything as soon as I can!

We have a son who is in grade two right now. At the beginning of the school year
He then asked if he could go on playdates with some of his female school friends and again of course we didn't care.
About a month ago he asked us if we could buy him one of those poofy cupcake dresses (I don't know what it is called but it is usually colourful and looks poofy). He told us a girl at school had one and he liked it. I told him I wasn't sure
My wife said no that it was a bad idea because ""boys should wear jeans and play baseball"". I went out two weeks ago and bought him one. She was upset but seemed to get over it. We let him wear it around the house
Here is the problem now though. He wants to start wearing it to school and outside. I have no idea what to tell him. On one hand I know he is a young kid trying to figure out his sexuality
What do you guys suggest? have I enabled my son too far and now will I screw him up if I don't let him wear the dress?
Thanks reddit.
P.s. My wife and I are not homophobes or anything we just don't want our kid to get beat up.

EDIT; Sorry I was away I took my wife and boy out for a lunch date and then I had to do some cleaning.

I had a ton of experience babysitting my niece in high school. Five hours every weekday and knew I disliked babies but everyone told me it's different with your own because you love them.  It isn't that different. My daughter is mellow and an easy baby but I still wish I had never had a child. 

I don't know what to do. I can't have more but my husband would be devastated. I'm already doing my daughter a grave disservice by being her reluctant mom.

Update: I'm feeling better knowing that the baby stage isn't fun for a lot of people. My baby and I had the car today and went out and came home to a clean house. It was a big chunk of what I needed. I was letting the threat of waves of future babies overshadow the cute one I have now. It's a relief not to feel locked down to a new baby every 2 years. Not saying that parenthood is what I was made to do but I think I can lovingly raise her into a responsible adult.

**You're probably wondering why we've asked you all here**

Greetings parents of reddit!  Following a [recent post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/161q0s/meta_all_right_folks_can_we_outright_ban_cute/) our mod team has been having a lot of discussion

First a little background.  In general we've remained relatively hands-off and whiled away our time quietly removing spam submissions and enjoying the posts that the rest of you bring here.  /r/Parenting is, news articles, photos and blog posts related to having and raising children of any age.  We think of it as ""general interest parenting"" as opposed to other related subreddits that may highlight certain types of content more.  As such we've tried to make links to related subreddits prominent in our theme to help those who are interested in something more focused to learn about those resources.

So with a mostly laissez-faire moderation philosophy and a growing subreddit we've occasionally run into the same discussion that many other subreddits before us have encountered; ""Are certain types of posts beginning to overtake the content of the subreddit and driving out other types?""  In our case the most often-cited type of proliferating content is photos of your kids.  This post is neither intended to involve nor take a side in any debates about whether or not pictures of your kids are a good thing to share on reddit.  It's been obvious that some people like them and some people don't.  The fact that they are both popular and controversial is all the basis we need here.  This post is about moderation philosophy and the direction of the subreddit.

For those who ask the question of ""Why is moderation necessary at all?  Don't votes decide what is popular on reddit?"" we would point out a few things.  It's been pretty well established on reddit that there is a phenomenon (sometimes referred to as the ""fluff principle"") which essentially states that quickly evaluated and easy to digest content always has an unintended competitive advantage in the reddit voting system.  For more on this see the links at the end of the post.  Additionally there is always [Eternal September](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September) which is accounted for in the [reddit FAQ answer to ""Why do we need moderation?""](http://www.reddit.com/help/faq#WhydoesredditneedmoderationCantyoujustletthevotersdecide)

So given all of the above why hasn't anything been done previously moderation-wise about pictures of kids or image macros on /r/Parenting?  We've usually evaluated the state of things based on observations of the front page content of the subreddit (the top 25 post on /r/Parenting).  Typically the front page has reflected what we want to see: a mix of discussions, the image posts rarely occupy the majority of the front page, leaving ample space in the top 25 for some good articles and discussions as well.

But this is based on the assumption that everyone who reads /r/Parenting does so by directly visiting the subreddit, very little other than image posts make it from the front page of /r/Parenting to user's combined front page at reddit.com.  (This weekend being an exception because we temporarily enabled text-only mode due to some troll issues)

Therefore we have decided that it's time for a new policy for /r/Parenting to bring the mix of content here back to a better balance.

---

**Okay

We are instituting ""Wallet Photo Wednesdays"".  Beginning this week (starting Monday) image posts will only be allowed on Wednesdays.  On all other days image submissions will be automatically removed by /u/AutoModerator (many thanks to reddit grand wizard /u/Deimorz).  We will also have /u/AutoModerator leave a message in removed posts to inform submitters of the policy and other options (such as waiting for the image day

We will aim to open up image posting late on Tuesday US time and close it down again either late Wednesday or early Thursday.

---

**TL:DR There are a lot of pictures and not much else showing up on the reddit front page for people who subscribe to /r/Parenting.  We are going to automatically remove images that are posted all but one day out of the week (Wallet Photo Wednesdays!) to encourage other types of content to get more exposure.  On other days consider submitting image posts to /r/ParentingLite or /r/CuteKids.**

1349650104.0,113wj8,Neighbour's baby,Miffed_Kitty,392,187,484,"Hello Parents

I was hoping you could offer advice on a situation which is not improving.  Our upstairs neighbours had a baby this spring.  We live in an old building where sound carries clearly, the parents would leave the windows open so it sounded like the baby was in our bedroom.  We politely asked them to close the windows but it wasn't until the building Super told them of other complaints that they did so.  It is now fall, the baby is older and her cries are louder.  Last night, she SCREAMED for over an hour starting at 3am.  It sounded like she was being boiled alive.  I guess she has an ear infection or  something.  We were driven out of our bedroom and ended up sitting in the living room watching TV until it was over.  If this happens on a weeknight and we have to work in the morning, I will be more than angry.  
How can I approach the parents and ask them to improve the sound baffling in the baby's bedroom so we can get a good night's sleep?

Edit: So basically all of you parents think someone else's choice to have a child is perfectly fine in causing a major disruption in my life. The couple upstairs moved in this spring, I would be confronted about it in a second but due to the fact that it is a baby screaming/crying I'm just supposed to let it go? Fuck that. 

Edit edit:  Thank you to all the legitimate responders for your comments.  I realize my edit was jerky &amp; harsh and I'm sorry for it but will leave it there

Anyway

Now, who doesn't have a mental disability, but who is still very, VERY immature has apparently been covering for my sister so she can go out and have sex with random guys.  (I believe under the guise that they're going shopping or having sleepovers, etc.)  This has just recently come to light and it seems as though it may be a little too late.

Anyway, but she really doesn't realize the consequences of her actions.  She has low self-esteem due to her disability and excessive weight issues and I feel she has started compensating by offering her body to men for the attention she so desperately craves.  

While I thought we had moved past her little freak out when we first announced my pregnancy, but she certainly doesn't realize the consequences.  I also think the whole situation is propelled more by sexual gratification than actually trying to get pregnant.

So, pre-diabetes and back problems due to her weight.  She clearly cannot take care of herself physically and all the attempts my parents have made to rectify and/or modify her unhealthy behaviors have failed.  You could tell her 100 times why eating certain foods are bad and then help her make good choices, but she'll literally throw a tantrum like a three year old and sometimes get violent when she doesn't get her way.  

Okay, although I know none of this is my fault.  She's always been jealous of me because I'm ""perfect"" and no matter how much I try to reason with her that we're simply ""different,"" it doesn't get through.  I'm sad and upset for her.  I'm disgusted other guys and men would take advantage of someone disabled.  It's just a crapshoot at this point.  If anyone has any advice or opinions, I'm all ears.

TL;DR:  My sister is a mentally disabled minor (17) who may be pregnant.  I feel guilty because she's upset about my pregnancy and I'm at a loss for what to do if she is pregnant.  She cannot take care of herself

**EDIT**:  I just spoke with my sister.  Fortunately, she has also been referred to an outside clinic for HIV testing.  It's come to light that she's had sex with over 10+ guys/""men"" in the last few months.  My Mom and doctor are discussing long-term contraception for the future, but that obviously doesn't help with the STDs she's contracting and likely spreading.  My parents will be visiting this weekend and I am going to speak to them about arranging outside authorities to take over her care once she turns 18.  If they are unwilling to consider these options, I may very well get in contact with social services myself.  Any advice on this process is appreciated.  

**EDIT 2**:  Holy cow!  Thanks for all the support.  I'm trying to reply to as many as comments as possible

**FINAL UPDATE**:  I spoke with my parents earlier this morning and here's where we are.  I was able to look through her Facebook messages (after piecing some information together with my parents - btw, three other guys - although there is no evidence to support that specific claim) and he admits (he's obviously not very bright to post this out in the open on Facebook) he was trying to get her pregnant because he wants another child.  He's basically put the last nail in his coffin because he admits knowing her age, yet still made very specific and explicit plans to have sex with her...he even admits to the act itself!  This is sick and probably TMI, but there is physical evidence as well.  He apparently gave her his shirt...which he, um, masturbated into after they had sex the first time.  Anyway, I took screenshots of the entire conversation - over 225 messages long - off of his Facebook wall and will be sending it to the police once my Dad contacts them.  

Surprisingly, but that's what she needs.  As far as the contraception is concerned, my parents are seriously considering Mirena for its longevity.  We should know the results of her STD tests (herpes, HIV) by the end of the week.  She has started treatment for chlamydia.

I really want to thank everyone for their outpouring of support.  You have helped me through a very tough 24 hours and have given me lots to think about,False,self,t5_2qhn3,1361288466.0,,,t3_18rovd

However, lego’s etc.) because he has a hard time relating to them. In turn, I know my husband loves his children and will gladly take a bullet for them but sometimes I don’t know if his love is unconditional. He has VERY high expectations of them. I often remind him that they aren’t born with knowing how to express their emotions without crying. Or knowing that things are dangerous. Its our jobs as parents to teach them. He yells at them (like getting up in their face yelling) when all he has to do is explain so they can understand. They do not know how to react around him. I am afraid to say that they might fear him. Actually

Here are a few examples of some things he says:
“Honey
“Man

“Daddy
“No”
(toddler walks away crying)

“Dad can I...(cant even finish sentence)
“No. Nothing you have to do is important” (again

“Daddy

I just wanted to say thank you guys for all your help, and that I might need to find other employment if it continued. She finally saw my side, and agreed that I could put a schedule and discipline into place. She even agreed to continue whatever I put into place when I'm not there, which was a huge step. I drew out a daily schedule, and put it on the fridge at his level. 


When he gets off the bus, but when I come through that door, it's homework time, and he has the option of having a snack. From four to five, he has an hour of free time, which is spent outside (weather permitting). Five to five thirty, dinner. (I know it seems early, he has 5:30-6:30 for more free time. At 6:30, etc. That way


The schedule is working out great, etc) will give him one extra minute of indoor free time (and push bedtime back by one minute). Not following rules (running around the house, not turning off the Wii when I ask, ignoring people when they talk to him... etc.) will take five minutes of indoor free time (and put him to bed five minutes earlier). I also put into place a ""three strikes"" rule when we play the Wii. If he's shouting, or being violent with the equipment (he's competitive and gets frustrated easily), he gets two warnings, and the third time I shut off the TV, and put it on top of the fridge. 


The first day I input these rules, he ASKED me if the dishwasher needed emptying yesterday, and then proceeded to put away clean silverware without being asked. We lost a team game on the Wii yesterday, and he informed me that ""it's okay that we lost, 'cause we can do it again! Games are all about having fun, not winning!"" I was shocked, because this was a complete turn-around from last week!

At the beginning the breastfeeding was rough.  Hurt my wife a great deal.  She wanted to quit right away but I convinced her to stick with it as it would get better/easier.  Well I Was right and it did get much easier.  Now she's pumping more than enough to feed the baby

Last night she told me that she is done breast feeding because it is too stressful for her.  She also said she is going to stop breast feeding because ""she wants her boobs back"".

My response was : ""Ok I respect your decision

In order to back up her decision

Now I know this might get backlash but I feel like to stop breast feeding is a cop out. It's the ""easy way out"".  There has been some other instances where I have had to say to her ""Listen, or when she talks about getting her friends to come watch the kid so she can do her homework. 

We have different mentalities when it comes to raising the baby. For me, and I feel like maybe my wife is stuck in that mode still.

Anyways, makes me uneasy. Especially when there is really no life-threatening reason to stop breastfeeding. 

Am I just being overly controlling? Should I just blindly agree and backup my wife's decision without stating my opinion?

EDIT:  Just wanted to say thank you so much for all of the comments. I love hear everything from both sides of the coin on the issue. So many great perspectives brought up that I never thought of before. I am reading through all of the comments and plan to respond to every one. Thanks again. 

EDIT: Also just to clear a few matters up instead of repeating the same comments to questions posed: 

Night time feedings: I do get up and feed my daughter at night with the pumped milk store in the fridge.  My wife goes to bed around 9 or 10 with the baby, feed the baby, put her back to sleep, then get ready and go to work at around 7am when my wife comes back into the bedroom and continues sleeping until my daughter wakes again, often around 10am.  We worked out this situation weeks ago and it has been working GREAT for us.  

EDIT : Here is a picture of my daughter and I http://i.imgur.com/NPWe6.jpg
I would post one including my wife but I wouldn't want to do so without her permission

EDIT again: Talked to my wife today in the car on the way to a doctor appt. for my daughter.  Resolved a lot of what may have been misrepresented ideas last night.

I'm a single dad. I have 3 kids (Boys are 5yo, my ex and I had an argument after I asked her why she told someone I had a speech impediment. When she denied she ever said it, and I presented proof, she then told me to never contact her again and she will ensure that it would happen. The next day, I was served with an Intervention Order against her and my daughter. Claiming that I abused them both physically. I was not allowed to see my daughter during this time. 

A month later, I was wrong

A month after that, she did not express any concerns to the police about our boys living with me, and she still saw them every second weekend.

It's now 3 months since I've seen my daughter. Her mum has never given me her number, and while I've initiated court proceedings. It can take up to 15 months to get anywhere (Victoria, AUstralia).

I am so afraid that my daughter no longer knows who I am, which she has claimed previously. I'm scared the damage is done. When I do eventually get to see her again, be it next month or in 15 months, when she is nearly 3 years old, she will not see me as dad, just a stranger that all of a sudden she has to spend time with. 

All day today, their mum has also stopped seeing them also and they have been asking me why. I can't do anything but explain to them that mummy loves them but is currently very busy.

Here's a bit of background:

My wife and I already have a 2.5-year-old daughter who is perfectly healthy and generally awesome in every way.  We decided to get pregnant again and everything was going along fine (aside from the never-ending nausea for my poor wife) until she got a high MSAFP reading on a blood test.  We were concerned but my wife is always borderline for gestational diabetes

When we went in for a follow-up ultrasound, kicking, etc.  We thought that was a sign that everything was fine.  Obviously, that made it so much more painful when we learned the truth.

We went to a genetics counselor who told us that the baby exhibited the [lemon sign](http://radiology.rsna.org/content/228/1/206.full) and the [banana sign](http://radiopaedia.org/articles/banana_sign) which both pointed to spina bifida.  We discussed the options - continuing the pregnancy and seeing how the baby developed further

After grieving and discussing the options

The day between the first and second ultrasound was one of the longest of my life.  I was very hopeful that they would find nothing and we could have the baby but I always had the idea that would not be the case in the back of my mind.  In the second ultrasound

We continued with the termination the following day.  It was scheduled at Planned Parenthood because our insurance company does not have the staff for the procedure.  We were met by protestors who made the day that much more difficult.  Planned Parenthood was quick and effective but it was a cold

Anyway

I just ask that you hold back from judging me in the context of your personal morals or religion.  I can tell you that this is the most difficult decision I have ever made and it was not made quickly or without significant forethought.",self,t5_2qhn3,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1d0mtv/at_45_months_pregnant_my_wife_and_i_were_told/

I was a lifeguard for 4 seasons, where you would pick a kid up, and place them back on their feet.  Often, the parents would be very close by, unaware that their kids were in trouble, because they didn't recognize the signs. I don't blame the parents; they didn't have the training/experience to spot what was happening.

Contrary to what you see in movies, do not flail madly, they make hardly any commotion at all.  A young child (2-3 years old) can drown in mere inches of water.  A young child will essentially lie face down in the water while they're in serious distress. Kids that young are often not super-steady on their feet; it will never occur to them to simply stand up and save themselves.  

These kids are particularly vulnerable when there is something interesting either overhead (a blimp, and will be knocked down and into danger in seconds.

Hopefully this is useful to someone.

[Original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/puhhl/becoming_a_parent_has_ruined_my_life/)
  
Almost immediately after my previous posting
  
Previously
  
**My social life:** *just fine*. My wife was not into the idea of giving each other ""days off"", and, if I go out on a Saturday night, so long as I get back reasonably early on Sunday morning, my absence is hardly noticed. The key factor in this is that caring for the baby has gotten much less strenuous. I can go to a friends house for the night, and have confidence that my wife and child are having a fine time without me. 
  
**My sex life:** *revived*. Not long after my last post, but what I really missed was the intimacy. One problem, aside from the exhaustion, was that we'd both sort of withdrawn emotionally. We'd basically become co-workers, and we were both so stressed out and preoccupied, it was like we'd hardly seen each other. Eventually we put out brave faces aside and had sort of a postmortem on the first three months. Once we'd gotten some things off of our chests and emotionally reconnected, and ever since the two weeks were *almost* up

**My finances:** *improving*. I've still got my day job, but I'm pretty sure I'll be able to stay in the black.
  
**My health:** *eh, not being so stressed out, I'm not feeling quite so run down as before. 
  
**My career:** *improving*. I'm not breaking any productivity records
  
Some little things have helped, and he'll just sit there jabbering to himself. It's adorable. Also, he hasn't been going into ""inconsolable mode"" as often or as severely. There were times before where, no matter what you did, the best you could do was to get him to cry less hard, and futilely trying to console a child is just soul crushing. We'd get stuck in these epic struggles trying to get him to fall asleep, and after an hour or two of that, and it's a blast. We'll have half an hour of laughing and playing with the baby
  
Thanks again for all the advice and encouragement from before. I just wanted to let everyone know that things did indeed get better.
