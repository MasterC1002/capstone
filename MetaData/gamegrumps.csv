1374789287.0,1j21po,Thank You All.,egoraptor,3598,1401,619,"My view on creative content is that the work speaks for itself. If something is bad or good, and it becomes its own source of joy independent of the show as a result.

I am having an insanely good time with Danny. He demands of me so much and brings me to my limits. His incredible work ethic

I'm so grateful you all have accepted this ""New Grumps"" in spite of all the sudden change. I understand how frustrating it may have been to experience all the change at once and I'm truly sorry to have caused any grief. We are doing the best we can to continue to put on a good show, so that's what I wanted to do. The entire Grump team has been amazing in the past month and they've been working so hard to not only improve how the show is made, but also to create new things that we're super excited about. We've never worked so hard on the show before, and we don't intend to stop.

So... thank you guys for being so cool, and creative, and loving, and wonderful. You make working on Grumps a complete joy, and we honestly couldn't do it without you. 

As a PS... If you'll allow me to address a couple things directly while I have the stage

I want everyone to be assured that I'm always working. My personal life suffers from it sometimes, but as many have stated before, it's no excuse to be lazy when it demands relatively little time of me. New cartoons or shows on Egoraptor have been slow because I've been busting my balls since the release of ""Console vs PC"" working on a huge project that I'm aching to show everybody. I've never put so much into a single project in my life... it's huge. The one thing I'm superstitious about is announcing details about WIP projects, but I've trickled out a lot of hints about what it is over the past couple months. All of the hints are connected... they are part of one big massive project. I won't drop a date until I know for sure everything can get finished before then.

Thanks again,False,self,t5_2ulfu,False,,egoraptorspecial,t3_1j21po

Hey Everybody

   I just wanted to write you all a quick note to say Happy Grumpiversary (sp?) and share my appreciation for what you do.  When I came on board the show a month ago I knew it was going to be a wild ride.  What I was not prepared for was the outpouring of love and support from you guys

   All the emails and messages I've received from the fan base mean a lot to me (even if I can't manage to answer them all).  Jon is my friend as well as a unique talent

   Anyway, and have definitely lived up to the name ""Lovelies!""

Sincerely (totally!)

What confuses me is people seem to think that Arin being loud and abrasive is a new thing. Have you ever watched any of his interviews or shorts? There have always been moments where he seems to ""fly off the handle"" because he's passionate about something.

I think the reason so many people are up in arms lately is because a lot of us can relate more to Jon. He has a much more ""everyman"" kind of personality, its just debates between friends. If you have a really good friend, you can be loud and blunt about how you feel, because they'll know what you're saying and what you're not saying. And regardless, we have no right to judge their friendship. If Arin and Jon have problems, they'll talk about it. We don't need to judge and yell about something so stupid.

TL/DR: Shut up with the Arin drama already!

Edit: Obligatory ""Holy shit front page"" comment. I seriously didn't expect my little rant to do anything other than get buried. Anyways, I know I directed this at Reddit, but honestly I should have directed it at the fanbase in general. Still, there is a lot of overlap between sites, and I've seen plenty of snarky comments here and there.

When I said Jon was the ""everyman"" I meant it in the typical gamer nerd fashion: quiet, and he doesn't know why. Arin's very analytical, and often looks at the technical aspects of games beyond most people. I mean, just look at Sequelitis. Now that's not saying either one is ""better"" than the other at being a Grump.. They're just different. I relate more to Jon, and I have a friend who's very much like Arin. Guess what? Our discussions about games are almost identical to the Grumps.

&gt;I'm happy to announce that Egoraptor is currently very happy.

&gt;Today I will wrap up a long awaited production that has spanned nearly an entire year. Should it have taken that long? Hell no. But the production itself has been a personal journey. How personal could a 3 minute cartoon about video game monsters yelling at each other be? Very.

&gt;In the time from MAGFest to now I have reworked many aspects of the cartoon because they were lacking. I'm very very happy with it now. It will be ready today and once everything is double and triple checked

&gt;That's not entirely why I'm happy though. I'm happy because this journey has taught me a lot about what it means to be me. And what makes me, and it will be finished soon as well. I am cursed when I announce specifics so I will continue to refrain from it, but just know I am MAKING CARTOONS.

&gt;I hope you like what is in store for 2013. I am very excited to make you laugh!!",self,t5_2ulfu,False,,jontron,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/1c3b2i/egoraptor_im_happy_to_announce_that_egoraptor_is/

1370548972.0,1ftaie,"Some helpful tips for Jon and Arin playing Stretch Panic [Please Read This, Jon &amp; Arin] (WARNING: HUGE WALLS OF TEXT)",TurboSaxophonic,459,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/1ftaie/some_helpful_tips_for_jon_and_arin_playing/, one of which is actually *needed to beat it*. I'd like to pass along a few tips &amp; tricks to the grumps

 1. Abilities that the gosh-darn game never tells you about:

 -1a: The instant stretch-jump: Just grab onto any terrain and press R3 (click down the right analog stick or press whatever button it may be for you)

 -1b: The Scarf/Smart Bomb, and is needed to actually beat each boss. To do it, you need to grab onto a boss and then press L3 and R3 at the same time. This makes two mini-scarves appear and latch onto the enemy. Once they both attach (and not before), wiggle both sticks like mad and you'll do massive damage. Using this power properly and at the right time on a boss exorcises the demon (a floating head with wings that will follow you for the rest of the fight) from them and makes them return to being human when beaten, rather than just disappear. You MUST exorcise each sister to truly defeat them. Also, each boss has their own proper timing and location on them to attack with the Scarf/Smart Bomb, so you have to be careful with it.


 2. Boss strategies (O means the Grumps have gotten to this boss

 O-*Siren* (singing songstress) (long description since she seems to be big trouble for the Grumps): The fight that is the bane of the Grumps. Wait until she sings, and holding down on the right stick while hitting the grab button each time you pass one of the little buggers.) They won't get back on if you so much as grab them once, so just drop them once you have one and move on to the next. If you do it right, Siren gets pissed and starts flailing her arms around while closing the spinning sphere to transform. However, she isn't bright and manages to get her arms **slammed in the closing sphere-mouth**, inflicting massive damage and preventing her from transforming. Also, make sure to exorcise her as soon as the fight begins


 O-*Cinder* (giant-headed flame-belcher): This fight is pretty simple. When Cinder opens her big, just let go of it after yanking) to stun her. Not much to say with this one, you can exorcise her at any time in my experience, but try to do it when she's stunned for the best results.


 O-*Spinner* (whirlybird thing that flies around): This one is a bit easy


 O-*Miss Mecca* (giant robot): Piece of cake. Pull on her until the eye-meter fills and launch yourself into her to stun her (it's a bit hit-and-miss). Stretch her and let go for massive damage when stunned


 X-*Anne-Droid V2.1* (flying robo-lady on the moon): Hoo boy, she's a pain in the ass to keep an eye on due to the Super Mario Galaxy-style level. Also, the little TV-heads will try and zap you, ignore and avoid them if you can.


 X-*Fay Soff* (giant mutant Ms. Potato Head): This fight is fun, and if you slam into her again she'll take a ton of damage. Exorcise her when she's stunned (embarrassed), the usual.


 X-*Samantha* (dark Linda with a fish-head on a chain): Remember all the various Shadow Link fights from the Zelda series? This is Stretch Panic's silly version of that. Easy fight though. Samantha will attack with the fish-head, and then dodge it when she throws it at you. Once she does, the chain she holds the fish with will be grab-able, grab it and snap it to send her careening face first into a metal or flaming ball. This stuns her so badly she **spews chunks** for a couple of seconds, allowing you to stretch &amp; snap her directly, or exorcise her.


 X-*Jelly-Chan* (blob with a face): Probably the easiest fight in the game. Exorcise her when the fight starts


 X-*Cyan* (4-armed alien): Annoying fight, and you'll have to pull them off. Why do you care about these little guys? Because, if all of them fire on her at once with no downed troopers missing out, she'll glow white and become vulnerable to attack. Exorcise her when this happens, and stretch her and release to do huge damage at this time after the initial exorcism.


 X-*Mirage* (Egyptian queen): Easy fight all in all. Exorcise her right when the fight starts. Then just stick near the somewhat annoying to find water puddles and lead her to them when she does her sand tornado attack. She'll suck up the water and the tornado will turn to solid mud. Then just stretch &amp; snap her for massive damage.


 ^(Fun fact: Mirage uses the same ""DAMN IT"" sound clip as Siren if you attack her with a low damage attack while she is flying around and not attacking.)


 X-*Demonica* (serial killer trying to get inside to... *greet* you): Demonica makes Anne's fight look like Jelly's in terms of difficulty. This is the only boss you literally cannot directly see and fight, with a wonderful little cutscene to show you just how boned you truly are. The only way to tell where she's going is to listen to the sound of her walking or beating on a door, and watching her silhouette outside the windows. When she beats on a door or trapdoor, snap it back at her to hurt her. When she goes to the rainbow-y screen-door that you can see shadows through, **run to whichever one she is at and snap it FAST, or you will die!** If the rainbow-door you're looking at has a huge silhouette of a monster, snap it. If it's a silhouette of a hanging woman, some of the doors spit out minions


 ^(Fun fact: Demonica is the only boss that can instantly kill you if you fail to do something properly


 X-*Spirit* (final boss, as her name implies, a ghostly princess/dancer girl with demonic-looking gloves. You have to attack the gloves, as the rest of her body is untouchable. Exorcise her as fast as you can, which is easier said than done since the small target makes latching on with the mini-hands a pain in the ass. I recommend grinding for a ton of points in EX stages (get enough to do like 5-6 scarf bombs (25-30 points), as they're the most effective attack in the game), then entering the fight. Keep scarf-bombing her hands


Once you beat Spirit, the boss music is SO GOOD, and you just gotta hear it. Best of luck to you.

I seriously can't believe this sub has come this far. I remember creating this subreddit quickly before hopping onto CoD 4 with my friends. I expected to get about 100 active users at most on here but now,000 members! 13,000!!! It's just mind blowing for me to see this place blow up. Over the past 4 months we've received multiple shout outs from the grumps themselves, an AMA with the freaking editor of the show, the domain www.gamegrumps.com, a ton of user flair courtesy of /u/xandan and /u/slyphoria, an awesome bot that posts videos thanks to /u/AndrewNeo and some pimpin' CSS goodies like the header from /u/Steel_Ninja.

I'm extremely grateful to everyone for submitting

Thank you to all the mods for their time and effort over the past few months and for the (hopefully!) many more to come!

Thank you Barry for editing the show

And thank you Arin and Jon

I tried to do a giveaway on /r/gaming, Jon or GameGrumps, but this subreddit is still related to games.

ANYWAY

Over the years I've been collecting a lot of Steam games, some good, mostly indie, a few 'bigger' games.

Now I have heard about bots scanning posts for keys, or has a whole lot of upvotes (this is a selfpost I believe, so I don't get any of the karma myself, it's just for visibility), I will update this post with the announcement that within X amount of time, all the keys with their ""puzzle"", some more difficult then others, will be posted.

This is an example of what it would look like (the key actually works):

[EXAMPLE](http://i.imgur.com/OVb0l3K.png)

They will be posted as images

Almost forgot to say an important thing

EDIT: Since it turns out it's not that hard to get to the GameGrumps frontpage

EDIT 2: A hint of the games in the bundle: A humble Indie bundle or two, Razor 2, Commandos, and some bigger games like Just Cause 2, Hitman: Blood Money and Fallout 3

EDIT 3: Miscalculation in edit 1

EDIT 4: (These edits are getting out of hand lol), with [THIS ONE](http://i.imgur.com/pAcEhdf.png) it is a bit different, there are two hints/questions/clues/thingies. Just remember that they are always in order from top to bottom, as you can see with the corresponding numbers, there are two letters missing in the first word, and 1 in the second. That means that the first letter from the first word is first, then the second letter, this code should actually work too! I hope I explained it well enough.

EDIT 5: I just went through the list and placed a light blue dot above games that are Linux compatible and a purple dot above games that are Mac compatible. Not a whole lot are

EDIT 6: For the people that are still here

EDIT 7: RIGHT, 59 minutes to go.

EDIT 8: Reddit was down for me

EDIT 9: All keys must be gone by now. I hope everybody enjoys the games they got,False,self,t5_2ulfu,1365952109.0,,GreenLinkNES,t3_1at178

1372400477.0,1h8fgu,This is a serious time in Jon's life,DePorkchopSandwiches,354,64,39,"There's a couple points that I think haven't been addressed in all the discussion and rumors about Jon's departure.

No matter what is happening, uninspired, unfulfilled, or unable to focus, even it's just from something that's four hours a week.  Call it depression, creative block, whatever

There's a lot of focus on how it should have been handled better, a falling out and making up with Arin, loss of creative control, otherwise being pushed out.  'Why couldn't they have done the transition better or at least give us an update by now?'

No matter what

The other point I want to suggest and question I want to pose is why couldn't this be a much more serious time in Jon's life?  He prides himself on his transparency, it's serious enough to keep private.

What if it's something medical?  What if it's something going on in his family?  Or just as one example

As for it being sudden to us, so it seems like they would have had time to do it better.  But when a friend has a life changing event - a medical situation/ injury, a death in the family, you don't ask them to go into work, do you a favor, or especially get on camera and explain it unless they're 100% ready for it on their own.

I'm not trying to make excuses, and suspicions about their personal lives.  

He's still Jon.  Let's treat him like our buddy who needs our love and support right now.


tl;dr  Imagine all the things that would be too serious, then assume Jon is going through one of those right now.  He's our buddy.",,False,self,t5_2ulfu,False,,
