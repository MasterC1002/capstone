One thing that really gets my blood boiling is poor gameday etiquette. This is a really big game this weekend, please be nice and friendly to the visiting Tiger fans. Yes, some of them may try to start stuff with you. Be the better person. Be an Aggie.


We have not played LSU at Kyle Field for a very long time. For many visiting fans


Friendly banter about the teams


If someone starts something with you, make them look like the idiot. When you wear a Texas A&amp;M shirt, you are representing the school. Please don't make us look bad.


If you see fans wearing hats in the MSC or walking on the MSC grass *politely* inform them. 


Finally


Sorry if this sounded like a rant. After reading Facebook posts and flame wars

1336363354.0,tao6c,What Ags Really Are About: a (very) short history of aggie homophobia.,rljacobson,123,39,60,"Homophobia is an old and still-thriving tradition at Texas A&amp;M University, a student being [brutally disfigured by some homophobic cadet](http://www.houstonpress.com/2008-01-24/news/rotten-to-the-corps-a-question-of-justice-at-texas-a-m/) and the incident getting covered up by the aggie powers that be.

When the first group of students wanted to organize a group of support for GLBT aggies, as the group was then called, had to fight an eight year legal battle, going all the way to the Supreme Court of the United States, for official recognition any other student group could enjoy. Administrators, including the university president, are quoted in Battalion articles from the era defending the decision, university administrators were informed that they could no longer spend public funds to continue the legal battle to keep the gays off campus. But John Koldus and company couldn't let even a hint of tolerance into their aggie hearts, ""There are no gay aggies."" It stood for days as a testament to the aggie tradition of homophobia.

Was that really so long ago? Is it just the worst of a student body of 50

There are plenty of redass GLBT aggies who love this school and its (other) traditions. There are many GLBT ags who cherish their time here. And there are GLBT aggies and GLBT ally aggies who are trying their hardest to rid this campus of its long and strong tradition of bigotry. During the Gay Student Services battle, spoken from the mouth of your classmate? Will you just sit there?

1346595491.0,z8aoo,So.... I found a drunk guy sleeping in my car this morning in front of my house on College Main,AtomicKetchup,85,11,26,"As I groggily exited my house this morning to go to work I noticed  a cell phone on top of my car. Now I wasn't all that surprised considering that I live just behind an area packed with college bars (Northgate for all you Aggies out there)

A snore.

I turn around to see a guy passed out laying down across my backseat... In nothing but his *boxers*. Surprised, I even open the door for him, but he will not get out of my car on his own. Annoyed, I grab his shoes and his soaking wet clothes (still don't know why they were wet) and throw them on the ground next to the car. This seems to get the point across and he crawls out of my car while drunken mumbles escape his lips. 

At this point I think I'm free of the drunk, throw them outside the car, and politely but firmly ask him to close the door. But instead of complying, he sends a slew of annoyed mumbles my way and again places his things in my car. Getting closer to anger, I get out of my car, walk around to his side, throw his things out of the car again, I finally am able to get my car started and pull out of the drive way.

But after only driving a few blocks

*Reddit needs pictures*

I quickly turn around and zip back to my house so I can snap some shots from the road, but after no luck I drive as fast as I can to work so I can get paid to post my story reddit.

Lesson of the day: If you live near bars or a college campus

**TL;DR** Find cell phone on top of car. Find drunk man in car. After a battle he finally gets out. Run and tell Reddit

**Update:** I spoke to my neighbor after work and he said that the drunken man knocked on his door after I left, at which point they informed him that the cops were on their way. As soon as he heard the word ""cops"", he bolted, leaving behind his clothes and shoes still piled up on my drive way, his cell phone, and his wallet... which had **$800** in it. When the cops came my neighbors handed over the phone and wallet with all it's contents. My neighbors appear to be very decent men for not attempting to profit from this man's drunken escapade, but as for me... I've got my eye on quite a nice pair of Nikes sitting atop a dirty pile of clothes outside my front window.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/aggies/comments/z8aoo/so_i_found_a_drunk_guy_sleeping_in_my_car_this/

This leads to a good 10 minute conversation, saying that as long as I keep trying I'll make it.

I'll admit, and answer the occasional question he threw my way. Looking back, I really wish I'd done more than comment on his caulking job (which looked top notch, if anyone cares).

At the end, and then we parted ways, wishing each other the best in the hard times to come.

I guess the point of this post, and everyone will say howdy to you and just be generally nice. While I've been lucky enough to avoid any negativity, I will say that I have never felt so welcomed, and so much kind-spirited concern, as I did while speaking to Ernest.

This is a man who just spent the last few hours outside, I wouldn't have noticed if I hadn't stopped to talk to him. And yet, this man, with such a thankless job, encouraged me to complete my degree, despite the hardships I'll face, and almost seemed proud of me for working my hardest to get a degree. Me. A complete stranger whose name he didn't even know until we shook hands and parted ways.

Ernest isn't an Aggie, he is one of the few people I've met here that seem to truly embody the Spirit of Aggieland.

Can't say I'm a big fan of the phased development


Scope of Work


This project consists of a significant redevelopment of the Kyle Field Stadium on the campus of Texas A&amp;M University in College Station. The work is anticipated to be implemented in multiple phases, and site and new exterior enclosure improvements to all sides of Kyle Field. Following is more detailed information on specific modifications and additions that the project will include:


The demolition and replacement of the Netum Steed Conditioning Laboratory


Relocation of existing athletics and operations staff in the West side of stadium


Initial site utility work (chilled water, etc.)


West Side: demolition and replacement of the entire West stands including adding six rows of seating closer to the field, the West side of the stadium will have a grand indoor plaza that will allow for large indoor gatherings as well as a connection to the outside tailgating areas directly adjacent to the stadium. The upper seating decks will have bleacher seating serviced by an upper concourse with typical fan amenities (restrooms, concession stands, etc.). Finally, a new Media Level will be located at the top of the upper seating bowl to house the Press/Broadcast areas along with coaches and other associated booths.


South End Zone Lower Level: an area for press, computer operations, football locker room and recruiting room. The lower seating deck will have chair-back seating with access via a new concourse to the Bright Building Nutrition Center which will serve as a club on game days.


The playing field will be lowered approximately seven feet and moved approximately eighteen feet to the south. The relocation of the field will also improve sightline issues for the north end zone seats and allow for the addition of six rows of seating to be added on the east and north sides of the stadium.


South Side Upper Level: the addition of an upper seating deck and concourse. The seating capacity of this deck is approximately 12


East Side: to help address code and inadequate egress issues in the east stands


A final sequencing plan for all phases will be established in coordination with the A/E team,,False,self,t5_2qyds,1353429608.0,,True

I got a simple ice cream cone with amaretto and red velvet ice cream, got this raspberry sherbet. He was going nuts in the car saying how delicious it was. So we were all pretty satisfied with our experience there and vowed to stop by again.

The NCAA really has zero leverage in this instance. They won't have any physical evidence tying Johnny to any money. So they will have to rely on testimony.

Now how do they get the testimony? Well...they really can't compel it. Basically

So lets say that the broker decides to say that Nate told him that Johnny wanted money for his autograph. Well now what does that get them? Johnny/A&amp;M/everyone else will deny that this ever happened.

So now what can they do? Well they have to get ""Uncle Nate"" to admit that not only did he solicit money for Johnny

So when it's all said in done (barring other evidence we don't know about), then that Nate rolls over on Johnny as well...then MAYBE they have grounds for a suspension.

Edit: Source - best friend is an attorney who has researched and written extensively on the NCAA.

Edit 2: The NCAA will also be thinking about the ramifications of taking down JFF. If they target and suspend the most popular/exciting player in the nation (and the in SEC even more importantly) based on flimsy testimony and hearsay
