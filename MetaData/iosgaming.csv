[Here's my list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AtXD0HaWjNnCdGY1cnRnSGREem9MS2JDMDVTN2VnbEE&amp;single=true&amp;gid=0&amp;output=html). I was putting in pricing and platform data

In its current state

Feel free to PM me or comment below with questions about any of the games on the list or with recommendations for me to add to the list.

I don't have an iPad yet and I don't typically like racing games or first-person shooters

---

Some additional comments if you feel like reading further:

* I think the massive amount of Puzzle and Strategy games is representative of both the kinds of games that work best on touchscreen and the kind of games I personally enjoy most. I also really like Platformers
* The genres are really not fair. Some of these games are extremely hard to classify and two games in the same genre are often wildly different. ""Strategy"" for OLO and ""Puzzle"" for Little Inferno feel particularly misleading
* I'm always looking for games for my 19-month-old so if there are any great ones that your young ones enjoy, suck.

I've played about 600 iOS games over the past two years. If you want a recommendation

---

**Edit:** The list now includes 18 suggestions from you fine folks. Keep 'em coming. I will be heavily organizing the list over the next few days so it can become even more useful.

**Edit 2:** I've added about half of your suggestions

I'm going to release this soon as a shared Google spreadsheet instead of a published one so that you guys can copy

Will continue adding games and updating current ones. I think I'll also be adding an iTunes link for each game.",self,t5_2sc2s,1372920072.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/iosgaming/comments/1heueo/hundreds_of_ios_games_that_dont_suck/

1346722202.0,zb8qo,What iOS games do you think deserve more attention?,Wordshark,66,6,62,"I think it's time for this thread again.  What are your favorite obscure games?  What are some games that have never been featured in the app store (or were once featured but have since lapsed into obscurity)

I feel like I should get things started

geoSpark - This is a great skill/combo/whatever game by the same peeps that made geoDefense and geoSwarm.  Fans of geoDefense were pissed that it wasn't another TD

Space Ninja - This is the most advanced tilt/dodge game there is.  It's like a crazy hard danmaku, and it's tricky trying to figure out why everything happens the way it does.  You will die over and over and over, but when you finally beat a level you'll want to cheer.  Save your replays to watch in amazement at the crazy shit you somehow managed to pull off.  Everything about this game is quality, and the spot-on controls are actually what convinced me that tilt controls can work for hard games.

Puckerz! - Get this instead of Peggle.  Ignore the stupid name (I know it sounds like a Mega Warhead flavor from 1992)

BloodRunner - New-school 2D platformer.  It just gets harder and harder.  Super fun.

Panic Springs - It's like a lost Atari console game.  So fun.  As I write this

Vetica - Haha wow, bizarre vertical shooter.  Tons of different weapons, including asterisk cannons, bouncing tildes, and clouds of heat-seeking commas, mean you're sure to find something that you like.  A lot of originality and creativity went into this game, and it pays off.  This isn't just a gimmick

Spooky Hoofs - Another great game by Thomas Wagner

Time Ducks - Wow, and Flight Control, and Braid, and a slot machine.  This game will blow your mind.  It's rare to get this much innovation, complexity, and quality all in one package.

Corpse Craft - Mandatory for Edward Gorey fanatics (if you don't know who he was, or anyone else who marries gothic sensibilities with humor).  This genre-spanner joins Cartoon Wars-style two tower strategy, with Blowup!!-style match 3 controls for resource gathering, building units of Frankenstein monstrosities patched together from dead children, all done with fantastic Gorey-like visuals and between-levels poetry.

Perfect Cell - I have no idea how popular this game is, and the only non-evil people in the game are the dead scientists heaped in the background.  There are some great level designs later on, and the game mechanics are just fantastic--you can split into two (and later on, three) identical, controllable creatures, your health automatically refills, and if you hold still for just a couple of seconds you turn invisible--perfect for when guards under where you're floating.  Anything by Mobigame is going to give you a good time

About the game (from our website):

SUGU is mind puzzling multiplayer game based on symbols. You compete against friends or random players with the aim of making as many points as possible with the tiles at your disposal. The tactical aim of the game is to place the tiles on the board in a formation that will maximize the number of points. The player who first uses all of his or her tiles ends the game. The player with most points wins the game.

It would be REALLY awesome if you'll give it a chance. Any criticism

*EDIT: Thanks for the great suggestions. Is there a list like this on a website anywhere? Seems like it would make a great article if it was filled out with mini-reviews.*

*It seems there are loads of turn-based games. But what if you are in the room with someone and want the 2-player experience? There must be more actual 2-player games out there?!*



**Actual 2-Player**

* Fruit Ninja
* Doodle Jump
* Super Stickman Golf
* Krazy Kart Racing
* Call Of Duty: Zombies
* Asphalt 7
* Street Fighter
* [Zombieville 2](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/zombieville-usa-2/id454781476?mt=8)
* [Draw Race 2](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/drawrace-2/id433127774?mt=8)
* [Flight Control](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/flight-control/id306220440?mt=8) is fun to play with 2 players. Bluetooth and wifi support. The multiplayer mode is cooperative - you each have half an airfield and have to pass planes between screens to land the planes.
* [Autumn Dynasty](http://www.148apps.com/reviews/autumn-dynasty-review/) - real time strategy. Gorgeous and awesome stuff.


**Asynchronous/Play Against ""Ghost""**

* VS Racing 2
* Extreme Road Trip 2. Two-button racing/survival game that's F2P and has ghost psuedo multiplayer (you see your friends' most recent runs and their high score signs are in the background).

**Turn-Based**

* Words With Friends
* Word Feud
* Letterpress
* Draw Something
* Tichu
* SongPop - sort of like name that tune.
* [Zookeeper DX](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zookeeper-dx/id433596395?mt=8)
* [Disc Driving](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/disc-drivin/id402379680?mt=8) - *Disc Drivin’ is fun
* Spelltower. How am I the first one to mention Spelltower? Easily the best word game on iOS
* Carcassonne. I've got to agree with everyone else out there in that this game is amazing on iOS. I have the physical board game and rarely even use it because the iOS version is just so good.
* Outwitters. By the same folks who did Tilt To Live
* [Ascension](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ascension-chronicle-godslayer/id441838733?mt=8): Chronicle of the Godslayer. This game is brilliant on iOS and I recommend it for both solo and group play. The expansion packs are even better
* Hero Academy. Free-to-play strategy game (without annoying
* [Ticket to Ride Pocket](http://www.daysofwonder.com/online/en/t2r/pocket/) / [Ticket to Ride Europe Pocket](http://www.daysofwonder.com/online/en/t2r/europe-pocket/)   
* The Battle for Wesnoth
* [Lost Cities](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lost-cities/id465062454?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4)
* [Crazy Generals](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/crazy-generals/id571655295?mt=8)
* Hero Academy - turn based strategy / tactics. Loads of fun
* New World Colony - turned based strategy. Sort of plays like a board game
* BANG! - western themed card game. I know there's an iPad version


**MMORPG?** 

* [Minecraft](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id479516143)

**Leaderboard**

* Super Hexagon. Not strictly multiplayer

With all the drama over Sim City I have got an itch for playing some on my iPad. I am looking for recommendations on what is the best

The EA Sim City Deluxe for iPad looks like it might be the most complex offering but the recent reviews say it is broken. The other city sim games that are popular look a little too much like free to play time syncs then a premium city sim experience that I am seeking.

Games like Settlers and Civ Rev are not exactly what I am looking for but if you know of any games like Settlers that are maybe more based on development and economics than conquest I would certainly be interested.

Also, trade and combat but it looks pretty bug ridden at the moment. If anyone knows of something similar please mention it.

Nope.

* Multiplayer does not work
* Singleplayer sucks. (It's only fun in multiplayer)
* Audio is horrible
* Can't customize controls
* Lack of content makes it BORING and A WASTE OF *$6.99*

What a waste of money. 

Now

* Several Singleplayer mission modes
* Basic storyline
* Variety of zombies
* Variety of weapons
* Variety of class
* Co-Op mode for some missions 
* Survival mode which is also co-OP

Now this game has its flaws and the lack of players make the multiplayer aspect useless. But clearly it is a better game than CODBOZ

It is original, some love it and some just hate it.

I would like you to be the judge.

I hereby promise to have Don't Blink remain as free for download forever. It is my brain-child

FYI - I know there are some bugs, I would totally appreciate the details around the crash.  That will help me figure things out.  Thanks in advance.

There are items you can buy in the game to enhance your experience

Unfortunately

So

If you enjoy Mario Kart

Greetings, a video review site focusing on smartphone games. 

I want to be clear up front in saying this isn't a shill post. I have mod approval so long as the topic doesn't turn into blogspam city

In short: We want to foster a good relationship with relevant gaming communities and the developers who post in them. Thus far we've only looked at bigger-name titles (you can see our YouTube channel at www.youtube.com/neckbeardmobile if you're so inclined), I have you all to thank for a lot of our recent exposure... one of our KOTOR reviews was pretty well-received here, which kicked this whole idea off in the first place. Thank you very much for that! :) 

If you're a dev and you've got a game you'd like us to review

* A download code if the game isn't free-to-play
* An MP3 of your title screen music or some other music from your game for us to run in the background
* Written permission to monetize the review (or a note asking that we don't).

We understand that third point is especially hairy. If it helps explain, since they're not very nice to reviewers who monetize fair-use game footage if the developer complains. We ONLY monetize with permission, and your decision will have **ZERO** impact on the score we assign your title. We aren't dicks like that. We promise.

Our end goal is turn the stuff devs send us here into a kind of ""hidden gems found on Reddit"" feature. We posted a similar thread in /r/AndroidGaming that was VERY well-received (about ten dev requests so far)

That's pretty much all we've got. If you're not a dev but know of some good, please let us know. We're also always dying for feedback... if you see anything you 
don't like in any of our stuff feel free to drop us a line and let us know what we can do better. We promise not to flip our shit like that art class critique video that made the rounds a few weeks ago. That broad was crazy. 

Thanks again

Sincerely
Evan

Lightborne Lore's website: http://www.lightbornelore.com

The mechanic being tested is a simulation of cracking a combination lock.

It may sound odd

We've built a feedback form into the app with a few questions and a field for comments

EDIT: 11 testers already! Thank you so much! We'll be submitting a build in two hours

EDIT 2: Alright, you'll be part of Round Two.

EDIT 3: A few responses so far with great comments. Good or bad, but there are more mechanics to test (and eventually the full game). Keep an eye out for more opportunities!

EDIT 4: *Those of you in Round 1 who haven't sent feedback yet*: if you have the time

*For anyone interested in our development/prototyping process:* We'll be posting the results of our test (insight gained


**EDIT 5: The promised feedback!** Sorry it took so long to get back to you about this. We are prototyping multiple projects at once

With this prototype

* The popularity of the game's premise (based on the title of the post, our website content)
* Will knowledge of real combination locks transfer to this prototype? Is any explanation necessary?
* How long will people play? This was tracked in the app.

We asked the following questions in a post-app survey:


* How is it? (Frustrating, Fun)
* How is the level of challenge? (Too easy
* Would changing the combination length be an appropriate way to vary the difficulty? (Y/N)
* Would you play a story-based game that relied heavily on this mechanic? (No

We received a really positive response based on the post title. About 20 volunteers in just a few hours! Great validation of our core concept. However

Of those who responded to the survey, but we may not implement this. We WILL find a way to teach how to play, but I don't want to reduce any challenge into a ""listen for the click, rinse, repeat"" mechanic. I'm excited to test our next iteration!

6/8 testers said they would not play a story-based game that relied on the current mechanic

Several testers did not respond to the combination length question. If you can't figure out how to play the game

Finally

I guess this is just a little rant really... but it doesn't seem there are enough developers taking advantage of iCloud - Especially for games that are universal over iPad and iPhone.

I recently got an iPad, and enjoy it on my iPad... however, it is universal and so I can play it on my iPhone. Despite the screen real estate, I actually don't find it too bad to play on the iPhone - But this is regardless, it could be any game I'm talking about. But it would be nice to just play where I left off on the iPad, on the iPhone...

I just looked at the apps that are syncing things over iCloud on my iPhone, is Jetpack Joyride. I'm freakin' addicted to this game, but the scores and ranks aren't synced over iCloud, so I have a different top score and different rank on my iPhone and my iPad.

We at Broken Kings are working on releasing Castle Conflict 2, a second lane of attack with flying units, and the ability to customize any army of 8 units. We're hoping to go live with the first campaign in September.

I'm pretty stoked about this because we made the first version of this game three years ago, Game Center, etc... existed so now we get to take advantage of all that stuff + the stuff I've learned since + the beautiful art of Sean Dunkley to make it better than it ever was before.

At present we have 8 of the units implemented as well as the online multiplayer. [You can see some of our progress here](http://www.BrokenKings.com)

We are looking for a couple of things at this point:

1. We are looking for a couple of beta testers - not a lot - if you are interested

2. We are also [looking for some funding](http://www.indiegogo.com/cc2) - mostly to pay for our audio guy, you will get the first campaign map for free when the app comes out, $10 yields you every campaign map ever (however many that ends up being), $20 yields you an exclusive unit that will only be available to people who help crowdfund the game. Please note that the $5 and $10 reward do not currently specify that you get the campaign maps, and due to a bug with the IGG website I haven't been able to update these to specify this.

The limit I put on myself was to never evolve any symptoms.  In fact


2012: game starts on Brutal, I finally get cold resistance.

2025: I had infected everyone on the planet

2029: with only one symptom (cysts)

2035: first lethal symptom appears

2063: Still only 5% killed

2077: 18% killed

2094: 75% killed

2096: 99% killed

2097: The last human is killed in Greenland.


85 years!  I probably could have been a lot slower infecting everyone.  Maybe I'll do this again some day.

I am a bit finicky when talking about RPG games: I want them to have a bit of graphics as well (I know that this isn't as important as the gameplay and storyline but that's how I like them).

I'd like to find a turn-based strategy game for the iPad to occupy my brain for a bit.

What I am looking for:

- raster graphics (bouncy vector cutesy stuff I find annoying)
- medieval theme or something tasteful
- I don't want to be overwhelmed with stuff to buy/upgrade


Stuff I have liked so far:

[Warlords Classic HD](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/warlords-classic-hd/id532024361?mt=8) Beautiful remake of the original

[UniWar HD](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/uniwar-hd/id311456818?mt=8) Enjoyed the artwork

[HighbornHD](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/highborn-hd-lite/id389422026?mt=8) This is a very good game but tests my limits at times with the corniness

[Tank Battle:1944](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tank-battle-1944-lite/id514573436?mt=8) Good game

[Osmos HD](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/osmos-for-ipad/id379323382?mt=8) Ambient plus ethereal

[Heroes Blade](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/heroes-blade-lite/id399875831?mt=8) Beautiful game

[Flower Board](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flower-board-hd/id450677428?mt=8) Phenomenal

[Treasures of Montezuma](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/treasures-montezuma-hd-lite/id390141724?mt=8) Gem game but beautiful


Stuff I have not liked for whatever reason:

Izar-Origins

Palm Kingdoms Classic (sadly was only iPhone size and uninviting; did not want to invest in iPad v2)

Civilization Revolution (The ""sims"" graphics style I find very distracting)


On my list to try:

[Padd Trek](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/padd-trek/id412782761?mt=8)

[Metal Brigade](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/metal-brigade-tactics-lite/id413721712?mt=8)

[Battle for Wesnoth HD](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/battle-for-wesnoth-hd/id369563335?mt=8) Briefly played


Is there a better place I could post this? If so just let me know.

Thanks for any advice!
