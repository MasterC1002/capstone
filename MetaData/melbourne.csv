1370154579.0,1fiatd,Let's Legalize Airsoft in Victoria!,airsoft_victoria,309,121,177,"**What is Airsoft?**    
Airsoft is a recreational sport where competitors use replica firearms to hit each other with spherical

Gameplay of airsoft is varied, they fire pellets at each other, faking death when hit by pellets from the enemy team. Not only does airsoft encourage strong teamwork and mateship, but is physically challenging, something that could be useful for the most obese country in the world.

Airsoft guns are often gas or spring powered
Additionally

In order to break skin, injuries are rare except for eye injuries. When wearing adaquete safety gear (goggles and helmet), airsoft guns have almost no risk of injury. 



**Current Victorian Laws Regarding Airsoft:**    
According to a document hosted by Victoria Police which can be found [here](http://www.police.vic.gov.au/content.asp?a=internetBridgingPage&amp;Media_ID=78679)

This document states that airsoft rifles can achieve firing rates of 200 - 300 feet per second (60 - 90 metres per second). From research which can be found [here](http://files.webydo.com/150858/Non-Lethality%20confirmation%20of%20Airsoft%20Guns.pdf) which was published in *The ATFE Journal* volume 44 number 2 - spring 2012, machine guns, assault rifles and bolt action rifles, 
were tested, 
weighing 0.43 gr (6.63 grain). The muzzle velocity for each shot was measured and the penetration energy of each pellet 
was calculated. Not one shot reached a level of life threatening penetration energy or even a risk of superficial injury to 
the skin. It was determined that shooting Airsoft guns with plastic pellets is not lethal in any way.""

Additionally

These regulations made by the Victorian Police give no opportunity for airsoft to exist in Victoria. It is clear that airsoft is physically harmless and that airsoft firearm replicas are easy to discern from actual guns. The logic used by the Victorian Police to restrict airsoft guns in Victoria relies on the fact that there are no approved ranges in Victoria for airsoft players to use airsoft guns

There are a plethora of laser tag and paintball ranges in Victoria. If airsoft was legalized



**What should be done about airsoft in Victoria?**        
Airsoft is a sport with almost no reason to be illegal and a large fan base ready to play.

The Victorian Parliament holds the power to legalize airsoft within the state of Victoria. I believe that airsoft should be legalized

Although airsoft is a fun team sport

Additionally



**What can we do to legalize airsoft in Victoria?**    
The most important step to legalize airsoft in Victoria will be to work together. Co-ordination between groups such as /r/melbourne and the Australian Airsoft Council will be crucial.

Together, the bill will be signed by the governor of Victoria. 

[This page here](http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/assembly/petitions) helps to detail what will need to be done to create a petition. All signatures will need to be signed by hand and include a name and Australian address. 

Information in the petition will be crucial to this cause. If the lower house like the petition

Additionally



**Goals:**         
In the short term, a member of the lower house would need to be contacted, and the petition would need to be presented.



**What to do right now:**     
If you agree with this cause
1) Upvote this post for visibility    
2) Check back to /r/melbourne for update    
3) Suggest any corrections for this post    
4) Suggest anything that could be used to help the cause    

Thankyou for your time!

It's been great. Great friendly people. Awesome company and loads of gorgeous people to talk to and be friends with.

But let's cut to the chase.

I was down on Smith St. to do some discount shopping when the urge of a number two came up. The nearest public loo was the hi-tech one with an automatic door and music to sooth the wickedest stomach rumbles. I went in

To my horror, I don't know) and I've got no TP, no paper, and the bastard won't flush so I can at least wash my ass with shit water unless I leaned over far enough for the automatic hand wash and risk having shit all over my pants. Pressed for time, I had to do the one thing that I have done only once before in my whole life.

Off came one sock. With said sock I quickly wiped down and suddenly the 2 minute warning sound and light has started playing. Sock still in hand

Fuck that. I flipped it open and, washed my hands and just in time the door opens.

There was a queue of about 5 people waiting for their turn and I could tell they were disgusted that I took 10 minutes to relieve myself. I took this as a cue to NOT tell them about the malfunctioning TP dispenser as I waddled away with one sockless foot.

*[Sample URL](http://iphone.metlinkmelbourne.com.au/services/getTransportLineList.php?transportType=train&amp;1.50.20102011)* 

---

**getStopListFromTransportLine**

*values (req):* transportLine

*options:* transportLine: (the line name, bus, vline, nightrider

This provides a list of the stations/stops along a route. It also provides a ""location_id"" of the station/tram stop

For example

    {""location_name"":""Alamein "",""location_id"":""1002""},{""location_name"":""Ashburton "",""suburb"":""Ashburton"",""key_id"":""11"",""location_id"":""1010""}

*[Sample URL](http://iphone.metlinkmelbourne.com.au/services/getStopListFromTransportLine.php?transportLine=Alamein&amp;transportType=Train&amp;1.50.20102011)* 

---

**getClosestStopsFromLocation**

*values (req):* currLat

*options:* currLat &amp; currLon: a GPS co-ordinate || transportTypes: train, vline, nightrider

This is Metlink's geo-lookup feature. Feed it some GPS coordinates

*[Sample URL (Brunswick Station)](http://iphone.metlinkmelbourne.com.au/services/getClosestStopsFromLocation.php?currLat=-37.767718&amp;currLon=144.959591&amp;transportTypes=Train&amp;1.50.20102011)* 

---

**getDirectionsForLocationId**

*values(req):* locationID

*options:* locationID: the ID of the station. You can get the ID from getStopListFromTransportLine ||  transportTypes: train, vline, nightrider

This will tell you which ways the trains are running and on which line.

[*Sample URL*](http://iphone.metlinkmelbourne.com.au/services/getDirectionsForLocationId.php?locationID=1006&amp;transportType=Train&amp;1.50.20102011)

---

**getStopWithIdentifier**

*values(req):* locationID

*options:* locationID: the ID of the station. You can get the ID from getStopListFromTransportLine ||  transportTypes: train, vline, nightrider

This will tell you all about the ""location_id"". This includes GPS co-ordinates of the station/stop

[*Sample URL*](http://iphone.metlinkmelbourne.com.au/services/getStopWithIdentifier.php?locationID=1006&amp;transportType=Train&amp;1.50.20102011)

---

**getNextNumberOfTransportsForStops**

*values(req):* stopID, transportType

*options:* stopID: (not sure yet) || date: in YYYY-MM-DD format (eg, tram, bus, vline, nightrider

This seems to be the *train's* time table information. StopID doesn't seem to be the same as locationID. If you have the right StopID and time/date/transporttype it'll give you the next few services to run down the line.

[*Sample URL*](http://iphone.metlinkmelbourne.com.au/services/getNextNumberOfTransportsForStops.php?stopID=1029&amp;date=2012-04-22&amp;time=02%2018%20PM&amp;transportType=Train&amp;1.50.20102011)

---

**Note:** As you can see from the end of the sample URLs there's a value of 1.50.20102011

---

I have always loved this city more than any other in the world but these protesters have made me very angry. They are embarrassing and are trivialising an issue that for the US is incredibly serious.

We have it so good here. Our unemployment is low

Nobody seems to grasp exactly how localized the 'Occupy' protests really are. In the US corporations all but run sections of government, welfare is non-existent, the rich pay minimal tax through exploiting ridiculous loopholes, wages are actually sickening and the distribution of wealth is just awful.

Now that it's developed into violence (somebody mentioned to me the protesters are planning to storm Flinders Street Station today?) I think I'm just going to have to distance myself from identifying with the city I love until everyone gets educated on the issue. Right now this protest is just offensive.

He also didn't prepare ANY of the music tracks that had been requested by the bride herself
He was also requested to play ""smooth jazz"" while the guests dined. Instead he decided to played Enrique Inglesias and K-Ci and JoJo.

1371698368.0,1gpcse,An Open Letter to Metro Trains,greasypeace,174,58,109,"Sent to Metro trains:
I would like to relate to you a very upsetting and appalling event that transpired yesterday afternoon on the Parliament end of Platform One, the South Morang 4.16pm had been delayed. Not particularly surprised or concerned, I sat down in the seating area at the end of the platform, surrounded by 10 or so other passengers to await the train.

What transpired next is what my complaint relates to.

A man, which eventually progressed into him standing up and walking around and yelling out obscenities to no one in particular. 

Quickly this developed as he became fixated on one particular young man who wandered nearby and happened to catch his eye – he then approached him and started to verbally harass and abuse him. The young man eventually wandered away

He approached the bench seat that I was sitting on and violently kicked a newspaper between the legs of myself and the other person seated at the other end – when I jumped at the force, shouting at me that ‘It hadn’t touched me’ and the like. What followed can only be described as the worst verbal abuse I have even had to endure. I was called things like a ‘a fucking cunt’, a ‘bitch’ etc – the entire group of passengers who were nearby were called ‘filthy fucking skunks’ among other things. As soon as I felt safe to move I got up and walked away, to more swearing and abuse.

Eventually, that I would now be late for, however as I glanced at the aggressive man, I saw the four Metro employees talking to him, while he calmly talked back – one employee even smiled at something he said and patted him on the shoulder. 

Angry that this man would get away with being so disgustingly vulgar and abusive to YOUR passengers, not only to myself but also to the rest of the waiting commuters. Yet I was shocked by the fact that when I tried to talk to the employees I was basically shut down and told to move along. 

I got onto the train and had three other passengers come up to congratulate me on telling the Metro guys what had occurred – one man even told me that when he had observed the aggressive man shouting at me that he himself had gone to get the Metro employees – without him
My complaint is this – obviously

HOWEVER – Metro trains have a duty of care to ensure their passengers are safe from said nut jobs
Yesterday

I was very upset at being yelled at and called disgusting things for upwards of 10 minutes, everyone who was standing nearby were also afraid. And it took your employees 20 minutes and the request of another passenger to actually take action against the man.
And what action was that? To pat him of the shoulder and have a laugh with him? 
I don’t know what occurred after I got on the train – I don’t know if he was kicked out of the station or let go, yet an obviously disturbed and violent man is allowed to verbally assault your passengers for upwards of 15 – 20 minutes without any form of protection being offered by your staff. 

I am a 29 year old woman who has lived in Melbourne my whole life and have used public transport for all of my adult life, I am now fearful for my safety when catching your trains; this is simply unacceptable. 
Why should I pay a hefty price for transport and be scared at the same time

I am appalled at the service you provide.

- The housing market is cut-throat.  Want a nice apartment or flatshare?  Your ass better be monitoring Gumtree or other sites non-stop.  Things that show up are taken almost immediately so you better pick up the phone and CALL.  If you don't call
-  Every type of coffee is generally $3.50.  Not sure if there is a law about charging different prices for different brews but it seems to me that if I want an espresso
- Men wear short shorts
- Girls wear big shorts.  Oh the glorious 80s/early 90s high waisted shorts that make asses look huge....
- Women don't seem to give a shit about their hair.  I see all sort of uncombed/ratty female hair here.  Very different from Paris.
- I would describe fashion here as 'failed San Francisco hipster' or 'hipster lite'.  It seems you can generally wear what you want.  I see dressed down thong and t-shirt types alongside well dressed business types.  I like how you can do your own thing.
- Public transport is expensive.  The daily rate is great
- Eating out is expensive as hell.  Seriously
- Alcohol is stupid expensive. Not to beat a dead horse on this one
- There are many fit ladies here!  According to my girlfriend
- For as much sun as you get
- People who drive utes are generally assholes and drive like shit.
- If you're coming on a work and holiday visa and are trying to find a corporate job

Overall I love this city.  It feels like a great place to live.  People seem friendly, I'll explore these further.   I see a lot of complaints about transport here.  It seems good to me, but the iPhone apps for transport are well shit with recommending transfers.

Very interesting video. By the looks of it it appears that as she was walking home a man was following her and possibly speaking to her (sexual advances would be my guess). As you can see in the video she stops in front of the store, and he makes a hand gesture as if to say ""why not?"" or something to that effect. She then makes her final phone call to a family member. My guess would be that she felt intimidated by this man, and as a result got on the phone to scare him off. A male voice was heard in the background while she was on the phone, so he was likely still bothering her at this stage. Just the fact that she stopped in the doorway of the store suggests to me that she was feeling intimidated and scared.

&gt; HELP PROTECT THE ASTOR - A 'REEL' MELBOURNE ICON. We will be having a huge raucous launch party for THE FRIENDS OF THE ASTOR in June as we start to formulate ways to save the Astor. From 2015, have made no offer for us to extend a lease and are entertaining plans to turn the old dame into a private school performing arts centre and uniform shop. Melbourne could loose yet another iconic mainstay. We love the place and want to stay.

Melbourne is one of those places where there's heaps (HEAPS) of great places to find clothing

So here's a quick and easy map that I've used on some of my walking tours in the past

http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=212561331983691781867.00048503da0dc5b0d7209&amp;msa=0

In list form

**Suits**

**Godwin Charli** (~$800) for an excellent quality/well-fitted suit


**Harrolds** ($1300-$5000)  for fully-canvassed, don't remember) is made in the same factory/same fabrics as Dior shirts for about 1/3 the price, around $220 and will do some alterations for you for free so they fit like a dream. Can't speak more highly of this place, plus they give you drinks/whiskey/coffee/etc while you shop. Don't be scared just because it's a high-end place, the staff are amazing (ask for Julian if he's there) and there are quite a few reasonably-priced things there.

**Casual**

**Plane** (Manchester Lane) is by far my favourite place for casual stuff in Melbourne. Prices are ridiculously good for what you get ($15 for great quality/cuts in basic t-shirts, $80 casual shirts etc). Decent shoes and sunglasses and accessories too.

**Somewhere Store** (Royal Arcade) is a close second on my favourites, Cheap Monday, Tiger and other Swedish stuff. The owner, Gustaf, is a gentleman and a scholar. Heaps of jeans, chinos, shirts, jumpers

**Incu** (Flinders Lane) is another of my favourites. A streetwear-style store, sunglasses, accessories and whatnot as well. Absolutely love this store.

**Jeans**

**Nudie** (Lt. Collins St) make probably my favourite jeans in the world. Great cuts

**Acne** (GPO) again

**Somewhere Store** (Royal Arcade) and FAT (GPO) for Cheap Mondays ($90)

**Shoes**

**Luisa Uomo** (161 Collins St, worn it for a few months and then they fall apart? That's because the quality is crappy, the soles are glued on and the leather is cheap. Overpriced for what you get. Instead, get a good pair of hand-made shoes, high-quality construction and attention to detail that will last for years. Traditionally these shoes will cost $400-$1000+. Luisa Uomo is great because it's the discount store of Luisa (on Russell St) that sell European shoes like Armani, Church, Loakes etc. At the end of each season all the stock goes to Uomo and are discounted 50-80%. Stock changes constantly and it can be difficult to find things in your size, **BUY THEM**

**RM Williams** (Collins St) - The place to go if you want a pair of Chelsea Boots. They'll set you back ~$390

**Plane, obviously, and aren't formal (not that dress shoes can't be worn casually - right now I'm wearing black jeans with a pair of Loake brogues). Shoes in the $80-$200 range.

*Remember, ever get a square toe or a pointy toe. Round, almond, etc-shaped toes are classic and are really the only style that looks good*.

Source: http://www.yelp.com.au/biz/dr-follicles-barber-shop-fitzroy

**I have pasted it below**

*I'd like to share a story with you guys.

Once, in need of a haircut. Those of you whom have sojourned to Siam will probably know that the weather is quite often ""shit"" and ""hot"", so I felt the need to shed my lords of dogtown mane to cool the fuck down.

I was perspiring on the balcony of the seedy hostel that was my domicile at the time, sawat dee bro, let's get a haircut happening, and sat down.

Now, which is where your seedy sex tourist uncle goes on holiday. Anyway, the island is totally empty. Thai people give literally zero fucks. I'll write a list for you of the fucks that Thais give:

-
-
-
-
-Sanuk

As you can see

The barber shop I'm talking about here was a pretty good example of this Thai zeigeist. Zero effort in presentation, and shitty english. As I sat down and attempted to make what I wanted done with my hair understood by Aroon or Kasem or whatever my would-be hairdressers name was, I realised I was fucked.

Now, slower, and with more inflection. Guaranteed 100% to work (eventually) every time. After gesticulating and shouting for a good five minutes I felt that my point had made it across the lingual gap, and we were ready to begin the haircut.

My erstwhile barber then proceeded to whip out a pair of battered clippers and shear my head like a sheep. Fucking A. After the inital shock of losing almost a year's worth of hair I accepted my fate
""You wan nails done?"" He asked in shattered english. Why the fuck not? I was already bald
""You wan face done?"" Aroon/Kasem asked me again, I was.

After an eternity of sweaty torment my tonsorial jailer deemed it suitable to let me go and settle my bill. As I was reaching into my pocket for some grimy baht my coiffeur leaned conspiratorially toward me and leered ""You wan massage?"" with a wink.
""Not from you, the massages actually take place upstairs. Having come this far and not wanting to bitch out, I went for the optional massage. 

I'm sure some of you have seen the inside of a dodgy massage parlor. Those of you that haven't can just paint yourselves a picture with your imagination brush. The point here is that I went upstairs

It was the best damn haircut of my life.

Now that I've explained this story to you, most awful, terrible, haircut you can conceive of. Now that you can imagine this festering shit of a haircut, you can grasp the general idea of how my haircut at Dr Follicles was.

I hate seeing people waste money on clothes. Guys will spend $200 on a pair of glued-together shoes that only last 6 months, poorly made clothes with a tacky design.

Just thought I'd extend an invitation - if you ever have any questions about where to shop, just send me an email at info@agoodman.com.au or use the simple contact form on [our website](http://agoodman.com.au). Comes straight through to my mobile and I can help you out straight away.

**ALSO**, one of our favourite stores in Melbourne. Really great Swedish clothes, minimalistic designs, great for building up a base wardrobe. They're giving our clients 50% off. I don't get commission on anything you buy (ever!), but my business partner and I are being paid to be there and hang out. Especially good for overweight guys, they have some of the best pants for big guys that I've ever seen.

So even if you don't want to buy anything, we're always happy to give on-the-spot style advice and give you ideas on what to where/where to shop. If you would like to come, just shoot us an email (info@agoodman.com.au) with what time you're coming down as we're gonna be in and out all day.

Feel free to AMA here as well.

Last Saturday I bought a myki because they wouldn't sell metcards. 

Sunday arvo. I go to the bus stop near my house, and was fairly chuffed with myself, because I was reminding myself over and over cos I'm really not very good at that kind of stuff.

Then I hopped on the train

The gatekeeper opened the gate for me and asked me to go through and talk to ""those guys"", although I used it in Lilydale, so shouldn't it be able to know where I've come from?""

They took it off me, about an hour ago. 

""Yes.""

I owe Myki a massive debt.  Ever since I first got a car, I started to suffer from ""too many pies""-itis and my pant size grew.

Because I loathe the Myki system so much

So now, and we ride mountain bikes on weekends, and I'm getting exercise and everything!  And awesomely, I don't need to wait for Metro's delayed (or cancelled) and crowded trains, and I never need to swipe some stupid, defective bit of plastic or complain to the even more defective droolers at Myki support when they make an error.

So thank you, and I'd still be getting fatter.  You rock.

**Undercover Train Officers** - In Perth


**High haircuts** - All the ""cool kids"" (maybe 21 years old?) had them.  Like people put their fingers in a light socket then shaved the sides.

**Cute Birds** - At food places like McDonalds, their tweeting is becoming quite annoying.  The Minah Birds (?) were pretty by comparison to the Perth pigeons and brown doves, but the bastards pulled all my rubbish out of the wheelie bin and distributed it nicely through my yard.  Assholes.  

**Fancy Bus Stops** - The suburb I'm in has a bus stop with an LED sign showing the route and name of the stop.  There's even a little button that I'm assuming plays a recorded message of the arrival time.  In Perth

**Tiny Beer** - Some places don't sell pints.  WTF?

**No Fun** - There appears to be no toy shops or piss poor toy sections at Myers/David Jones.  Are there no children here?  Did an evil wizard take them all?

Motorcycles Everywhere - There's a lot more motorcycles here than in Perth,000 cheaper than Perth

**The Myki Cards for Trains** - In Perth we have a similar card, but I noticed this varies with time of day/week so it might be a data traffic issue.

**No natives** - I don't mean to sound racist (I'm not) but there are no aboriginals that I've seen.

I'm far away doing something I love - Bartending. 

Working downstairs@Bluestone is pretty quiet/relaxed

Located down the less trendy side of Flinder's Lane (corner of Flinder's Lane and Bond St)

People come downstairs for dinner (pizzas/tapas

I'm not promoting my workplace and I'm not begging for pity. I'd just like friends. Seriously. I need someone to sit at the bar on Chinese New Year while I work. I'm suppose have dinner with family but since I'm not, I win"" sorta thing.

So yes

If you have a date

If you're by yourself, I'll drink with you. No alcohol while I work. I drink cups of tea. No pinky finger extended. Yeah, that's how I roll.

Sad stories and bad days are acceptable but no crying. Drink up. I'll offer convalescence. 

If you're a hot chick

Yes

No

I'm not one of those *good-with-the-ladies* kinda bartenders. I don't know how to flirt and I instinctively ERMAHGERD in ALL my photos.

I'm a *beverage-nerd-with-tattoos-working-downstairs-of-a-fine-dining-place* kinda bartender. I can tell you about the tannins in your whiskey and the type of grain in your vodka. Traditionally, wines suck...or more precisely, I don't get it. 

If you drink whiskey and cola, it's cheaper.

My first Reddit post. Hopefully

Thanks guys/gals. Stay hydrated.

That said

I am an American. I left Australia from Cairns at about 5:30 AM last night, I had the absolute greatest moment of my life when I met a girl at a place called the Woolshed. Neither of us were really the type of people to go to clubs/bars and both happened to be there just killing some time. She approached me because she had seen me sitting alone for about 10 minutes prior to approaching me. We got to talking and she asked me if I danced. So we danced. Neither of us were really into the music or the dance scene and we ended up doing what I'm sure was a terrible dance to anyone watching but the cutest thing to me with us twirling each other around. 

Anyways, with her being the lead and doing most of the touching. I've never ever felt a connection like this with someone, certainly not so soon after meeting them. 

So we find her friend then go off on our own again and we just talk and talk. She has something to do early in the morning and I have a flight to catch in less than an hour. So the night comes to and end. She has me take out my phone and I use the inkpad app on it to let her type something in. She gives me her number, we share a long hug and then I get the courage to ask her if we could kiss. As soon as I asked she went in for it like she'd been waiting for me to mention it forever and we had a really great kissing scene straight out of a cheesy romance movie. We then hugged again and went outside where we met with her friends and she told me she wouldn't have access to her phone for about 5 weeks and I told her I'd e-mail her. 

So I walk back to my hostel happier than I've honestly ever been in my life. Everything was just so perfect

So, check my phone so I can copy down her info to paper and I see that I have lost EVERYTHING. When my phone was in my pocket the inkpad app was still open and I had written random letters and stuff everywhere and erased what she had typed. I'll be honest, I nearly cried. 

I'm back in the US now

So if anyone knows her or knows of her, let me know! Not only do I want to contact her again for my own desire to keep in touch with her, but I also don't want her to expect me to contact her and then think that I wasn't serious about her and had no intentions of keeping in touch when of course she never gets anything from me because I lost all of her information.

1355583499.0,14w91y,Attempted mugging near Seddon station; details inside.,Amyler,60,6,22,"I'm posting this to give people who may live in the area a warning about two kids/young men who attempted to mug me earlier this morning.

At about 12:15am this morning I got off the train at Seddon station to make my way home from a friends 21st. After getting off the train I began walking down Pentiland Parade

Halfway down to parade I could hear two people walking behind me. They were moving faster than I was, meaning I had no pockets and all my stuff was in a backpack. I called out to him that it was quarter past 12, since that was the time my train had pulled in.

At this they started walking faster, and now they had caught up with me. The two were obviously young, around 15-18. The boy who'd called out (Around 170cm, black) began walking beside me, and his friend (160cm-ish, white) directly behind. I was told to stop, but continued without acknowledging them. The taller one pushed me slightly, he took something from his own pocket; Because of my glasses and the dim light

The one behind me now had a hand on my bag; in response I swung an arm out from the strap and rested it under my other arm, because now I was home.

The kid behind me, and pulled. I laughed (nervous as hell, though not showing it) and told him it wasn't worth the hassle I'd give him, then asked if their parents knew what they were doing. The black kid then hit me across the back of the neck with his weapon, which I believe was a tennis ball or something wrapped in a sock. It hurt, but wasn't rock hard and was not sharp. At the same time, the other kid began pullling much harder on my bag.

I couldn't get the gate open, now beside his friend, swung at my face, though I lent back and it missed (I assume he wanted to knock my glasses off, or he had shitty aim). The other pulled on my bag once more, then they ran off, turning back onto Pentiland.

Now alone, but with big clunky boots and a long cape I was worried they would hear me and return. After a block or so I calmed down and looked behind me; no sign of 'em. While walking past Sabroso, I saw a small group of people leaving the club. I'd like to say I warned them about the kids, but I wasn't thinking clearly, and a pair went off towards Pentiland (I really hope they didn't encounter those kids, and seriously regret not warning them).

I'm home now, I really got out of it all okay, but I wanted to in part warn other locals about them, and also just talk myself through what had happened so I could work out what I did right/wrong. Thanks for reading this if you have. For reference, I am a 20 year old male who would be obviously identified as a nerd, and potentially an easy target (particularily considering the glasses and Syndrome costume.) 

tl;dr: 20 year old male was almost mugged by two young men aged between 15-18 near Seddon station. The muggers did not appear to have a deadly weapon, this does not mean they will again in the future.


I kinda want to mention what I think is important here. They asked for the time both to get me to slow down, offer them a best guess, and do not stop walking to do so. If they ask you to check, tell them you don't have something to check on. 

When they caught up to me, I did it because I felt threatened enough by their presence that I was worried I would be attacked for running. Calling for help may have been a bad idea, as those kinds of calls can be easily ignored, both by attackers and potential assistance. By calling for someone who I knew and was apparently nearby, they assumed they would have to fight for what they believed would be a very meagre reward. 

I am very glad I claimed to be near to both my home and my father, I feel awful for not warning other people in the area of a possible threat against them, allowing them to be prepared should they have encountered the boys. I also do feel somewhat bad for associating myself with a strangers home, and I intend to knock on their door at a resonable hour tomorrow and explain the sitaution, in case those boys decide to damage them home in relatation for my actions.

Sorry for the wall of text; I really just wanted to get this out of my head and spoken somewhere. Have a good night all,False,self,t5_2qkhb,False,,,t3_14w91y

Thanks to the lovely guy in a blue and white shirt

I had been out with my friends at the Retreat having a lovely time meeting crazy and colourful people of Brunswick.  A little after 1:00 am we left the Retreat

I got around the corner and some distance away from Sydney Rd when I heard a voice behind me:  ""girl on the bike!  Girl on the bike!  I've got your bag!""  I looked around and sure enough my shoulder bag was missing from the basket on the back of my bike.  A lovely 20-something guy was running after me carrying it.  Returning it

I was completely taken aback -- I didn't even realise something horrid had happened, I tried to express my thanks but I'm not even sure if words came out.  What an unexpected gift, such an act of kindness from a stranger.  I love Brunswick!

If you read this, definitely buy him a beer.  People like this are the reason I love Melbourne and Brunswick in particular!",,False,self,t5_2qkhb,False,,

So last week I took a sicky from work. I took a nap in the middle of the day

My daughter answered

Now, where he stepped into our kitchen, took a very cursory glance at our yard through the window, and then promptly left.

Now, but noted that he didn't offer to present any, although he wore a top with the council logo emblazoned on it. She also said that the white van he was driving was parked in such a way that she couldn't see if it was marked with the council logo either, but managed to get the rego.

When I woke up, explained the situation and asked if it was routine to send council workers over for a site visit in response to noise complaints. The operator at the other end was apparently irritated by my question, told me ""No"" and then promptly *hung up on me*.

I then called the cops and told them about what happened

So, but I'm uncertain as he did not attempt to survey the entire yard, even when he had a decent pretext to. Does this happen often with noise complaints? Is it unheard of for a council worker to conduct site visits for such complaints?

This year I'm booking out a room for us so there'll be no wandering around introducing yourself to strangers and hoping they're redditors

[Facebook Event](https://www.facebook.com/events/381518638566546/)

Softbelly is a funky enough little bar with plenty of space for all of us. Drinks are very reasonably priced and it's right in the heart of the CBD so everyone should be able to make it! I chose this venue mostly because it's free and it's only a $200 deposit that I'll get back as long as at least 40 of you show up. I'm confident we'll get 50-60 pretty quickly! There's a bit of room to over-flow in to the front room if a crazy amount of people show up

If you are not over 18, so gradually expose yourself to it. We suggest leaving your parents basement for a few minutes each day to build a tolerance.)

I'll update this post with more specifics (i.e. a map, but for now mark your calendars!

What's the difference between this party and every other party ever held? You're actually invited! Unfortunately, and prepare yourself for IRL convos. Members of the female gender will be in attendance, so if you encounter one, don't make any sudden movements, don't raise your voice above a whisper and above all else, DON'T PANIC. (Helpful hint: They like shiny things and equality)

Alternatively you could just skip this event, amirite?)

Almost blue / green? Three of us checked them before we were unanimous that they weren't real, at which point we held the money and called the police. 

As I said before, he legged it.
