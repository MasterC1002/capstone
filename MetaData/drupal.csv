I've been using Drupal as a CMS for some time now and have a very good understanding of it *as a user* but only basic development skills. I know the architecture but only developed some small ""toy"" modules.

My goal would be to get gigs on sites like odesk/freelancer.com etc... with the hope of landing some long-term projects through it. If you are from the first world the pay on these sites must not be very tempting but as someone who lives in South America I don't need 80K a year to live nicely. On the other hand, so that I can bid on more complicated projects than PSD to drupal theme.

The main reasons I'm considering this are:

1) Drupal is pretty popular
2) Drupal is pretty complicated which means there is less competition and you can charge a premium if you are an expert in it (again
3) I already know enough about Drupal to not have to start from scratch

I'm interested in hearing from drupal freelancers and people with more experience than me. Does this plan seem viable or are my assessments wrong?

I've  been asked to set up a webshop. I've done shops before with Joomla!/VirtueMart (also image preparation/data import etc.) but as I am currently exploring Drupal as my primary development system I would like to do it with drupal6/ubercart. Even though I am no Drupal wizard yet, Views, Panels, Imagecache/Lightbox etc. I am using Fusion for theming.

Also the shop would be very small (some sort of hand-crafted baby quilts)

Now my usual problem: how much should I charge for a Website with an empty Ubercart Shop but considering that I've got to do CI/graphics/proofreading/copy writing as well? Usually I get paid per hour (â¬50.- through â¬70.-) but as I've got to learn the system I'd rather charge a fixed price this time.

A little background on the project: The client had an old Drupal 6 site that was in dire need of an upgrade (looked like something straight out of the 90's). One of the hardest parts of the whole project was keep the 'new site' updated and current while minimizing downtime on the live site. 

I had to basically set up a 'middle man' site on my home PC, update that install to 7, then use Node Export to grab all the forum topics that changed during my initial database export (only about 4 months worth of posts). Comments I could get all in one shot with the table, but had to watch because some of my NID's changed from the live site to the new site. I learned the Drupal database structure inside and out because of all this :) I should have built an exporter, but I found it quicker to do it by hand. 

Another thing I love about this site is the video section. I set up Feeds to import their YouTube uploads

Still have to make some Views a little nicer (the article page is kind of dull, loads pretty slow)... The Hot Topic page needs a little love also, that was an afterthought that wasn't discussed in the original project, but I threw in last minute (the old Hot Topics was just that list from the site, didn't have any sponsor feeds, I want to make the feeds more like the homepage, import images

The whole architecture is so different from what I am used to that I'm finding it all a bit weird and even simple things seem to take a long time to accomplish.

Almost all of the documentation that I have found is either aimed at people who want to do all of their site building in the admin interface or people who are building everything from the ground up using custom modules.

In general I would like to use CCK custom content types

I'd really appreciate some pointers to docs or insight into how to create idiomatic Drupal from the perspective of someone that knows their way around code

Not only did I have to rebuild the site in D7, and direct exporting/importing of MySQL tables to get everything transferred. The most difficult part was getting the more obscure field types to transfer over, which is why I ended up using the Feeds module. An add-on to Feeds had proper mapping for an embedded video field, which I was unable to find for the Migrate module. I had first attempted to create my own mapping for the field, but was never able to get it to work properly.

There's an enormous amount of resources to help with a D6 to D7 migration, you may just have to do a bit of searching to find an example.

* There are a vast amount of security updates and bug fixes available. How do you estimate an update (with core &amp; module hacks)? (And explain the importance to the client?).

* Multilingual and 120+ modules makes a site significant more complex and adds to development time. How do explain that to a client?

I'm still not certain if this was disabled intentionally.  Then I noticed that Boost was disabled.  Clients typically hate static page caching because they don't understand it

It was at this point that my boss told me that ""they"" redid the site, and the biggest surprise was finding out that xcache was back at its default setting of 2x8MB which is completely insufficient for a Drupal site.

This site now takes 9.5s for first page load according to webpagetest.org, costs 2x to 3x as much to host, and is completely incapable of handling much traffic.  Should this client get some press the server is going to melt.

They wanted files password protected but wouldn't tell me why

They had *at least* 6 different salesforce forms all over the place

They wanted maps that included pins of all the nodes (sometimes upwards of 10k) which regularly crashed any browser

They wanted a ""fancy"" scrollbar on some pages, or they might decide that they wanted to page not to be limited in height.  The scrollbar is now gone (which is what I'd have done a long time ago if permitted).

It just makes me rage that I struggled with so many of these bad ideas, because they haven't asked us for anything in a while and I'm more than happy not to get requests from them.",,False,self,t5_2qhl5,False,,

- Don't have access to the current server

- I did manage to get the database out using 'Back Up and Migrate', but I knew that would happen). 

- Attempted to upgrade that install to 7, says the exact same thing (no help there). When I rerun update.php, it has 17 updates to do (forums, nodes and taxonomy are what's left), but immediately fails with the same error message. Site is non-functional now (on my home server). 

If I can't get the old site upgraded to 7, I can rebuild everything else by copy/paste. 

So

1. Can I build a Drupal 7 site and update the 6 database by hand? I'm fairly confident in my PHP and MySQL abilities

2. If that's not an option

3. Similar to option 2, upgrade home server to 7, transfer to 7 site on host. Install 6 again at home, get the 6 site working again, delete everything except forums, upgrade, transfer

Anybody have a good way to do this? They kind of outgrew their 6 install, I won't really care if I can't get anything else, that's easily done by hand. 

**EDIT: FIXED! Set max php timeout to unlimited and my max memory to 256MB and that did the trick. I think the initial timeout corrupted the database, THEN upgraded again without an issue. Thank you all for your comments! Now I'm going to try the site in both 7 and 6 and see which one would work best for the client.**",,False,self,t5_2qhl5,1345826139.0,,

Now, the team created a unordered list menu for external links in a block. Why wouldn't they have used the menu module, or a view? Or added this at the template level? The content itself may not need to change, but isn't this a development no-no?

2. My custom module runs which adds terms to the vocabularies (doing a taxonomy_import)

3. Other Features run

Now I am having a few issues... Firstly comes in number 2. For some reason I need to run drupal_flush_all_caches() before doing my Database query to get the correct vocabulary id to add the terms to

Secondly, then it works fine, but this doesn't allow me to control when additional terms get added, and maintaining those when term id's are used in views etc, as the IDs may change on the next site install...

Has anyone come across this before with the drupal_flush_all_caches() and strongarm?

It wouldn't make much of a difference, debug, and maintain your own module.  Do this enough and it gets prohibitively expensive.  I'm not talking about a couple custom tpl files or a hook here or there to do something straightforward, I'm talking about Rube Goldberg level contraptions.

As an example, so they need a way of getting that information there without having privacy issues.  The rational way to do it is to let the user *log in*, because that's what authentication is for!  You could use logintoboggin to sign them in on account creation then redirect them, or if you require admin approval just forward new users over to that page after you've approved and they log in the first time.

Either is an easy way of handling it and having a welcome page.  Instead the route chosen is to use cookies to store the UID of the user in the cookie, its going to require days of IRC spoon feeding to get the module to a point where it works if it ever does, and who knows what odd quirks or security holes will come with it.  I'm sure it will be glorious for all 5 people that see it though.

This might seem like making a big deal out of nothing, because they've hacked it up with a lot of custom code or won't do something simple like install views (I dont wanna use extra modules waaaaaaaa!).  Clients complain about the price, and people trying to build the sites complain because... they just don't fucking work at the end of the day when you apply this style of anti-pattern liberally.

I fully understand that some will feel ""if a client is paying, but at the same time arguing with clients (or random people in support) just isn't helpful.  At a certain point of absurdity, it would be like going into a restaurant and insisting that the chef shit on your plate, or telling someone at the honda dealership that you want a car with a propeller on it.

So I've seen the occasional ""help me build my website"" post and now I figured it's time to throw my name into the goblet of fire as well. Basically

The project I'm working on is a completely new website for a New York based non-profit working with impoverished musicians in India. The organization is very small and the director isn't tech-oriented, and often go months or years without a refresh. I figured that using Drupal would give her and her interns the ability to keep the website up to date with the minimum amount of tech knowledge needed. 

That being said, as I'm not looking to get too complicated. Going off the image as a guide, I want to build a site that has a user bar in the top right corner, a header, a navigation pane, a content pane and a footer. 

The user bar simply has to link to three separate pages - search, above the content pane (green). Finally, the footer at the bottom remains the same for each page. 

So, is there any advice you want to give a beginner before I get in way over my head?

I did some research and was impressed by Drupal.  ""sudo apt-get install drupal"" later, our site was live.  (I'm minimizing the effort it took to get this far, but you get the idea.)

So there was our Drupal 6 site with its basic Garland theme, but we had a website for the first time ever!  People were happy.  My legend grew. 

Here we are five years later

...until a few weeks ago.  I was notified that we needed a new site and that I was to write the RFP (Request For Proposal) that would go out to bid.  I was (finally) given some direction on what they wanted the site to do and look like.

So, traditional looking site, and one that was less of an ever-changing content page.

As I started putting the RFP together,  I was going to be the one administering it.  I further realized that whoever wins the bid will probably slap something together with RoR or Laravel or some other framework.  I've tried to learn those things, but they are confusing as hell, and I don't have the time or energy to start from scratch in trying to understand them.

So here I am, why should they care what powered it?  If I could pull off the site redesign without an RFP, my waning legend would return in full force!  (Full disclosure: no one really understands websites enough to care.  The whole ""legend"" thing is more self image than anything else.)  I dove into redesigning the site myself, sure that I could bend Drupal to the new vision of our site.

Alas, but upgrading a repository install with Drush breaks all kinds of shit.  I finally figured out how to do a site install with Drush, but it took various ""chown"" and file modification tricks to finally get the damn thing working.  Still, I got the test site working in the end.  If that were the only problem, I wouldn't be writing what is no longer a brief post right now.

What troubles me is trying to customize the site.  For example, but to finish off the pager involves editing what appears to be 352 css files.  (Actual count may be lower.)  So now I have a slideshow with a column of numbers below it, and apparently I'm just starting up the learning curve.

That's just one example.  Things like trying to get a horizontal menu bar with submenus have proven just as challenging

I recently finished college.  I turned down opportunities at conventional software dev jobs to enter the world of Drupal Development

I just found out my $25/hr salary as a contractor is far less than I thought it was due to federal income tax, so I figured the tax rate would be something like 15%.  It's actually 33%.  WTF.   This is pretty disheartening because I burdened myself with loans to go to a ""prestigious"" private school, and I was hoping to pay them off much much faster than a 30 year schedule.   The calculation looks like this:  gross income is $48000 per year.  After state and federal income taxes, my salary comes to $38000.  $38000 minus $5400 for self employment taxes = 32600!    Wow!  This my salary calculation for Oregon, where I hope to move (just in time for DrupalCon!)  I'm currently in Austin, Texas.  But jeez, that no state income tax sure sounds nice.

So

Here's my skillset:
* About 1.5 years casual Drupal experience (mainly working with admin interface, modules), and a few months of custom module dev (Created Android app that interacts with Drupal site)  Still, overall, on the front end of the learning curve.

1. runs Flash
2. requires lots of work and alterations to the site to update even a little bit
3. doesn't automatically sense the device you're accessing it from (as many CMS's can be configured to do) and therefore
4. doesn't automatically populate the viewer with new videos based on submission date (from a custom video content type
5. doesn't allow one to add vimeo-based videos in those submissions

I looked at WordPress and came away from that research with a big HELL NO!

Then, and produces REALLY elegant markup (for the most part).  I've been lurking here ever since.  I've also been thinking about going over to a Drupal meetup at MIT to ask some questions, but I don't want to sound like a fool with my newb questions.

The reason why I actually have to ask whether this is possible is I noticed that Drupal sites all have a pretty standard layout and I'd like mine to be much different.  I don't want ANY navigation text or drop down menus on my site.  The only text will be that of my blog, and resume (but I also want the entire site to be SE Optimized...).  I want all of the page section links to be in the right sidebar and I want them to just be icons as well as the navigation arrows for video, music, and photos.  I may need to have different sections with text to classify types of photos, music, or videos, but even that seems ugly to me (for example, there would be landscapes

Now

1. Is this feasible?
2. Is there a better CMS that would allow for such a thing more easily?  (I looked at Mediacore
3. How long will it be until Drupal 7's modules are up to the standard that I'm wishing for?

Also

4. device dependent layouts
5. slideshow implementations similar to my friend's site (with the ability to play nice with vimeo videos.  Preferably

Here is the impression that I get

* When you find that you're writing significant amounts of code that you might use again in other sites
* When the above is not the case
* even when the above is not the case

So, you could just add a few lines to template.php. If you want to expose the custom breadcrumb to the site manager through a form where he can select the breadcrumb delimiter, you will have to write at least custom breadcrumb code *and* code that uses the form API. Even in this case, without any database changes, a module might be a cleaner solution. Especially if you intend to re-use this code.

I hope the following question isn't too elementary. I""m very new to drupal and some searching / digging on the web hasn't yielded much results.

I recently installed Drupal for the first time and am trying to use it on a very content-heavy site of mine. My site will have 50-75 (possibly more pages) and another couple hundred articles (eventually).

My question is this: What is the best way to organize and manage this content within Drupal? I started adding content, all of the content is in one huge list and the options to filter it out don't help much because I really only have two basic content types (basic pages and articles - I don't really have a need for more from a layout perspective). I know that you can find/edit content by logging in and simply browsing the site, but is there any way to create a hierarchy of content so that it's a bit easier in the admin/backend?

So

Or

What's the best way to attack this? Seems like this should be at the heart of drupal

4. We're both new to Features and having been using this for our workflowâwe had to recently rebuild a lot of our Features to incorporate Strongarm and fix conflicts but it's all pretty much golden now. We're using Github for version control (also both new to using).
5. Website redesign overview: roughly 50 pages (not including blog posts from our assortment of blogs)

Our remaining timeline before soft launch is 3 weeks, cross-browser compatibility testing, and usability testing. We've been at it for about two months so far, but a lot of that time was spent spinning our wheels waiting for page tables from stakeholders and then converting that into a list of content types, taxonomy and establishing the info arch for each of those sections. Unfortunately for me (because this is one of my favorite parts of a redesign), I was told by my superior that information architecture was not my responsibility. However, the info arch was not completed and I am currently rushing to get it established so I can see the tokens for paths (pathauto) as well as which pages need to be created in Views.

I'm okay with providing more information if necessary and please

Thanks for taking the time to read.

TL;DR: Lots of stuff still yet to do in a big redesign project. Time is running out. What are acceptable timelines for when things should be accomplished? Being general is okay. Ask for more details and I shall provide.",self,t5_2qhl5,1371007257.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/drupal/comments/1g4f1j/how_long_should_it_really_take/

     * specific pattern:
     * - 404_fast_paths_exclude: A regular expression to match paths to exclude
     *   such as images generated by image styles
     *   If you need to add more paths
     * - 404_fast_paths: A regular expression to match paths that should return a
     *   simple 404 page
     *   any aliases ending in htm or html you can add '|s?html?' to the expression.
     * - 404_fast_html: The html to return for simple 404 pages.

The same is true for _all_ sites build on Drupal. So, search bar, etc, these can stay in the same place, I am talking about the ""center"" of the page has different layouts (images, etc...)

1. Do people use ""Basic page""  and hand code HTML/CSS directly into the ""Basic Page"" text area? (Does not seem this is the way to go)

2. Do people use  ""Basic Page"" and apply their own CSS? (If so

3.  Do people create a new Content Type and layout out fields for images

4. Do we create a lot of blocks and construct the page with a lot of ""blocks""?

**Edit 1**: It seems that there are 2 ways (without having to deal with extra modules) 

1.  Add my own template for each page

* Do we place the templates inside the current theme? if so
* Does it break Drupal's guideline to no edit basic themes?

2. Create a sub-theme (copy everything from Barthick  - in my case -- to the thems directory and change the templates there.)

* Should I copy ""everything"" or just enough for it to be  a sub-theme

I should preface this with ""I have no experience with Drupal""  :)

Looking for some advice here. I've been asked to resolve some issues with a business' Drupal installation. The person who did the initial setup had left the user registration page open. It looks like some bot was autocreating accounts and creating content with malicious links mixed among random placeholder text pointing to websites (""buy discount flip flops here!"" etc.). There were about 6500 extra accounts that had been made

Anyway

I haven't been able to find anything in the Drupal settings to fix this last issue. I have SSH/FTP access to the box and found leading and trailing strings to the code in question. You can see that [here.](http://i.imgur.com/PRqwtpF.png). I found that in [this file

I'm using Drupal 7 with Varnish. Recently I noticed that the login and sign up blocks are not working for anonymous users. When a user tries to login or create an account via the blocks the user is just redirected to the same page however the new accounts are being created and the user session is also created. Is worth mentioning that if the users tries this via sign in/sign up page they don't have any issues. The problem happens only when using the blocks.

I'm thinking the issue could be related to Varnish. I tried disabling the Varnish module but the issue is still there. Also I tried using the ESI module so that blocks will not be cached but that didn't do anything.

One big question on my mind is how we are going to handle the archives of the radio show on Linode. Up to now, limits us to 40GB, which we will outgrow eventually. The Live365 files ought to be smaller, as they are recorded at a much lower bit rate (but with better sound quality), but there are photos and music and all kinds of stuff going up all the time.

The POST would happen in AJAX and the response would be placed to contents on the same page (not sure how to do this with Drupal. i.e. hooks within the page content)

The posted data would be available for the users to re-edit/correct entries. but the entry can only be corrected/edited/deleted  by original poster. (not sure how to do this in Drupal either)

I came across some issues:

* A week or two after startup my project manager decided we did not want to make the website responsive. It would be to hard for the designers and become to costly. This made me feel like we used a to big theme for a normal website.
* The base design by the designers did not exactly fit the 960 grid. Due to my ignorance this made me abuse the grid system.

President of the institution apparently can't be bothered to have a user account on the website.   The President has requested ""can you just send me a URL that I can click before you publish the story"".

What I was hoping was...
If we anonymous goes to ""http://foo.com/node/123""  they would see ""Access Denied"" because its not published yet...

But if we send the VIP (who really is anyone... *sigh) :

Then they would be allowed to see the NODE even though its unpublished.

I am using Drupal 7 as webservice (using Services) for mobile app. It's great how fast it can be done with Drupal since there are so much things already done!

Currently project is in alpha stage

I wonder could I do development in some kind ""Debian"" way

* Have 'Unstable"" drupal site in alpha.myhost.com
* Prepare and regularly sync ""Testing"" site in beta.myhost.com for closed/open beta. It would be updated, it would help to test module/node/theme upgrades before releasing to wild public.
* ""Stable""

Could this scheme be reasonable enough? I am using Features module to make website more strictly.. ""defined""

How could I sync (diff?) alpha/beta/release websites with changing content types

Thank you!

I would like to use my client's new website to build myself a solid single page theme similar to the navigation of a site like this:

http://www.sweez.com.br/#inicio

My initial plan was to build a theme and maybe an accompanying module, and doing the same for future sites utilizing the theme.  


What I have so far:

1.  Drupal and many important modules including drupal commerce installed via drush

2.  Initialized a theme utilizing Matt Bank's Drupal 7 Starter Theme: http://goo.gl/tRkfd

3.  Compass for sass and Grunt for task optimizations

4.  Experience building a similar site



Here are my questions:

1.  I've looked around

2.  What is the best way to go about the sections of the single page site?  A custom content type that I loop through on the main page?  Each section will just have a name

3.  What is the best way to generate the items in the nav bar since they wont be ""Drupal Pages"" the way most themes display them?  If I went the route of a custom content type


Once those main sections are displayed and working
