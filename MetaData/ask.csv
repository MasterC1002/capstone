1323804406.0,nbbzv,I on a whim bought 160 acres of land in Canada. Ideas? ,Remerez,52,9,72,"I had the idea of buying land for years to grow apples and make hard cider so I don't have buyers remorse. I found a government auction that sells foreclosed land and the 160 acres were going for only $1

I can pay off the land but wouldn't be able to do much with it afterwards so I thought maybe make a [large fort](http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/united-states/Jamestown-fort.jpg) or treehouse from the nearby woods and try to amass a community of creative people. The area has no zoning so we are free to build or farm all the things.

the land is South of [Cochrane

I would only need around 30 acres to make all the cider I could ever want or sell and the fort would probably be 2.5 acres in all. so what do with rest of land???? 

I welcome ideas on what to do with the land



------------------------

EDIT: More info on the land:

*With Crown land bordering all sides

*The overall terrain is mostly flat with no irregularities except for a small low lying area in the southeast quadrant that may hold water particularly in the spring time (after any snow melts).

*Although trees have been harvested over the past few years

*A half mile north is the majestic Abitibi River with hundreds of fish filled bays and coves to explore. Ten miles west the river empties into large Lake Abitibi

To be clear, wiry hair. Almost like pubic hair. On both the stomach and nipples. (Oh God this is so embarrassing.)

Edit: mild typo corrections

Good afternoon! Or whatever time it is where you are. Sorry this is LONG! Any help is appreciated. Also

So, Texas, USA. I work (as does my domestic partner) at a veterinary office part time. I have two dogs and a cat. I spend a lot of time with animals. I applied for this kennel tech job in May to try to pull extra income to eventually go back to school/pay off my cc's. At first I thought I blew my interview by mentioning my SO (I'm gay) but later I received a call back and was hired. I didn't do anything except fill out a tax form when I was hired. I didn't sign any contracts. There were no printed rules or codes of conduct given to me at any point during my employment there. During my time working there I noticed a lot of unsafe procedures concerning the animals and every time I brought them up I was ignored or dismissed. This, of course, made me increasingly mad. Only a month after working there I started contemplating quitting. 

**Here is the review I wrote and the letter I got:** http://imgur.com/a/pnzam

**Here is more explanation:**

The last few days I worked there a lot of shit went down. I had a few disagreements with the younger male manager there - we were both in bad moods, very sick dog (on chronic soloxine (thyroid medication) and tramadol (pain meds)) was not only NOT given her AM medication during the morning shift as she should have been, she was left indoors in the kennel room, laying halfway out of a crate, with no a/c or water all afternoon (3pm to 7pm) while all the other dogs were out at play. (she ""snapped"" at the other kennel tech so they just didn't med or move her.) When they informed me about it and I went to get her she was not able to move or stand up on her own and was shaking, presumably in pain/discomfort. I carried her out into the office yard area and supported her back end to allow her to urinate and gave her her medications. The other staff informed me she hadn't been moving on her own or eating very much on her own at all. At that time I called the owner of the kennel and informed him I wasn't sure if she would live through the night and I thought she should be kept inside the office where the ""on site"" (younger male) manager lived and not with the other dogs in the loud kennel. Insert other convo/drama, but he informed me he had contacted the owner and the owner made arrangements for the dog's vet to come get her the next day and didn't think it was that big a deal but eventually conceded to letting her stay inside. I had the AM shift the next day. I stopped by my vet and picked up a can of a/d food for her ( [see here](http://www.hillspet.com/products/pd-feline-ad-caninefeline-critical-care-canned.html) ). When I got there I asked about her, but the manager didn't seem concerned, with a CONTAGIOUS FUNGAL INFECTION. She was out there one of the days I had my dog there. I was PISSED! I sent the owner of the kennel a VERY curt/angry text (almost all of our communication was via text)

I was fired that morning for ""personality differences"" and ""failure to adhere to instruction."" Personality differences? Definitely.. * When I asked for an example of how I disregarded instructions

Fast forward to writing the review and receiving the lawyer letter.

**Here is what I have that may be legally useful:**
I have text messages between the owner and I, and the (last) paystub he gave me that coincides with the dates.

I have text message logs with friends backing up my intention to resign as well as friends who would testify about my constant complaints about the safety procedures and desire to leave.

I have EXCELLENT previous/current employment references. This is the ONLY job I have ever been dismissed from.

I have probably up to three different veterinarians licensed to practice in Texas willing to write me letters to back up the conjecture in my review of the kennel.

**I do NOT have** official records of any of the things/pet check in sheets that went on in the kennel. I handled the animals

My mom is 57 years old, as she was pulling through an intersection, someone else was going on the road and T-Boned her.  When this happened it fucked up her neck, back, and brain. She has always suffered with depression / bi-polar, so some days she won't / can't even leave the house. I live ~400 miles from her, and my sister is &gt;1, she is on disability / unable to work. The constraints my mom deals with are as follows:

* Because of the car accident
* Because of the car accident, it overloads her and she can't process it.
* Because of the diabetes
* When she gets nervous
* She has terrible tremors in her hands / arms so working with small things is quite difficult (the Dr. thought she had Parkinson's however they found out it's just all of her medicines working against her. They can't take her off of them because they are for her depression  and a bunch of other things)
* She has a hard time hearing
* Her memory is not good anymore
* General depression

As a result of all this, and since she is always in her house she gets sad and depressed and doesn't want to leave house causing an endless cycle. So, now the million dollar question, what can my mom do?  Things she enjoys:

* Reading
* Drinking coffee
* Talking / being around people
* 'Making things'  She enjoys making things
* Being creative

My mom is a single parent and has been since I was 10 years old. She never dated or had many interactions with other males while I was growing up, Andrew. Soon after, they decided to get married and Andrew moved into my mom's place. 

The problem was that Andrew turned out to be a liar and a jobless leech. I don't really want to get into the details, yelled at her). But even through she kicked him out, he continued to call her OVER AND OVER again, leaving really NASTY messages, to the point where my mom had to get a new phone number. He also harassed her in person, knocking on our door at odd hours of the night and yelling loudly to our neighbors that my mother was a bad person.

When that happened

That led him to start harassing her at her WORK. My mom works as a waitress in a restaurant. One day, and a lot of other nasty things. The owner didn't want him to come again, so my mom got fired. She went to the police to complain, but they told her that her restraining order was only valid for her house, and did not expand to her workplace.

Last month, VERY LOUDLY, at all the waitresses, calling them ""whores"" and ""call girls"". The manager forced him out, and my mom had to explain the situation. Thankfully, the manager understood, but said that it couldn't happen again. So now, but now she is terrified that he is going to continue harassing her wherever she goes

Is there anything I or she can do to make him stop? Is there any way I can get him arrested? :( This has really been going on for far too long. I want to do something about it and make him leave her alone

Backstory:

So my wife of 1 year, or get into disagreements, we have a very healthy and active sex life, and truly enjoy spending time with each other. 

I was raised in a very 'traditional' home where my father made all the important decisions/purchases.  My mom, cooked all meals except for bbq, and took care of the flowers.  My dad would take care of car maintenance, yard work &amp; other 'traditional' male chores.  There was never any talk about sex, or drugs or anything of any consequence.  It was more of a 'you should know what we expect out of you.  We'll tell you when we're happy, but you'll know when we're not.'  My sister and I were raised with an 'academics &amp; athletics' come first mentality.  My wife was raised by more of a 'hippy' style of parenting.  Not to say her parents were all about free love and such, but they smoked weed and were a lot more open about life.


About 6 months ago, and we ended up having a three-some.  Now, not to say I'm a prude, but I've only been with 2 females(my wife, and my first serious girlfriend/fiance) prior to this.  Although this was a guys dream come true, I didn't actually have sex with the friend.  Mainly because it wasn't talked about prior, also because I knew she was kind of seeing another guy so I didn't want to intrude into their relationship it that fashion(come to find out that my wife completely didn't mind and was surprised that I didn't)  Don't get me wrong, just no insertion.  Since then


Jump to 2 Weeks ago:

My best friend's wife, but for the past 10 years, it's always been either a hug or a peck on the cheek.  So during her visit, she's dropping hints about Sister Wives and Big Love left and right.  At first, I didn't really catch on.  My innate reaction was ""I can barely handle dealing with one woman in this house, let alone two.  I would never be correct about anything if I had to deal with multiple wives.""  She laughed and took it how it was meant.  That night, the friend decides that she wants to watch tv in bed with my wife and I before lights out(not a problem, and we do that quite frequently with most of our friends).  So she makes sure she's in the middle and at this point, my bf's wife wants to go out on a 'date' with me.  Once again, just the two of us.  So we get back home


Where I'm running into problems:

So I'm completely split 50/50 on this matter.  Part of me thinks this is fantastic and wonderful.  The other part of me doesn't think I could handle someone else being inside my wife.  I mean, they're more than just friends.  They really are family.  They're also our kids godparents, and the types of people that you just want to have around.  Now my wife and I have had many conversations about this as well, and I just don't know.  I've been completely open about my issue in the matter, although my buddy doesn't have the same issue and gave me permission to f his wife while she was down here.  My wife doesn't have an issue with it, and neither does my buddies wife.  It's already been determined that everyone has to be fully on board for it to happen, so I'm not worried about peer pressure or anything like that.  But I do have some questions for those that have been in this situation before:

 - If you had concerns prior
 - What about social stigmas?  We have 2 boys that are 6 &amp; 3, especially if we ended up sharing a household together.

This past May I graduated from college with a BA in History and as it turns out its nearly impossible to find a ""real"" job. 

Throughout college I interned at several museums, I started working in retail at Nordstrom and after two months of ""first class"" customer service and commission based sales, I've found myself wishing I put my money, time and effort towards a more practical degree; a degree that is more of a vocation and allows me to adapt with the times. 

So after watching probably over 1000+ ITT Tech commercials on daytime television

1) Is ITT Tech a legitimate program that will be worth the time and money? Why or why not?

2) For someone who isn't great at Math (never taken pre/Calculus) what programs would I want to reconsider?

3) Is programming, computer repair, information systems/cyber security or any other tech related field in higher demand than the other(s)?

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated! Thanks!

I am thinking the end of the rope might be near and I ask Reddit for perspective, answers, and to at least listen to my story.",WelfareThrowaway,15,13

When I was around 13 or so, hard surfaces, and gravity don't do the body good. My dad got me chiropractic treatment for a few years which didn't seem to do anything to truly alleviate the pain. Sitting and standing too long was very hard for me. I'd be one of those kids constantly twisting in their chair cracking their backs and such. My dad never sought other medical advice other than chiro and who knows what else was really going internally. Whether chiro does a bit of good I know is a hotly debated topic and I won't get into that here. Let's just leave it with we at least made an attempt at treatment for the back problems stemming from the fall but whether or not it was the right decision, who knows.

About 15 years ago or so, aggravating the back problems probably ten fold. 

Ten years ago, or siting down for too long through the day, and some changes were going on mentally due to increasingly horrible sleep issues stemming from the pain by ways of having to wake up something like every 45 minutes to crack my back and change positions. I was never in REM sleep long enough that my brain needs (still happening to this very day). I was and still am a very tired, miserable person who ends up wading through a thick brain fog most days and who simply feels a lot like an idiot.  You know your brain isn't going full bore, you feel like you can't handle shit that day and all you can do is lay in bed and stare at the computer screen; reading, clicking buttons and engaging in as little mentally strenuous activity as possible. You hide from phone calls, picking a napkin up off the floor seems like the most difficult task in the world, but you get the gist.
 
The only way out from the pain other than the small amount of time I manage to sleep, it was still killing me with large amounts of back pain. This is when my social life really started to crash because going out anywhere required sitting and standing and it was just awful. No more concerts, no more long car drives, I severely cut back on everything. I definitely fell into a bad depression and luckily I still lived at home and my parents were tolerant of my life and I was living off them and really just being poor and scraping by and feeling like a piece of shit for multiple obvious reasons you can imagine someone in this case would have reason to feel like one

At that time, because there was no way I could suffer 40 hour work weeks dealing with that kind of pain, and I still can't... in fact no where close to 40. It took me a while to fight through the depression to even begin to find the motivation to go online and apply for welfare and disability to at least get some kind of meager cash coming my way to scrape by and take some burden off my family.. 

Now to fast forward and try not to bore people away from this. 

I have been seeing specialists for years for my back problems to try and find relief, injections... My actual diagnoses taken directly from my medical reports are as follows:

1: degenerative changes in L4-L5 and L5-S1. There is a broad right sided disc herniation at l5-s1 which causes effacement of the anterior epidural fat and posterior displacement of the right s1 nerve root. A broad based disc bulge is noted at l4-5 with annular tear which cuases a minimal impression on the adjacent thecal sac. 

2: there is a narrowing of the lateral recesses at L4-5 as well as the right lateral recess at L5-S1

3: Neural foraminal narrowing is noted at l4-5 and l5-s1 as described above

4: There is slight levoscoliosis of the lumbar spine. 

With those diagnoses

Lumbar Facet Syndrome

Lumbar herniated nucleus Pulposus

Lumbar radiculopathy (Sciatica)

Lumbar Degenrative Disc Disease (spondylosis)

Thoracic paraspinal dystonia

I don't know how it is in other states, you may as well need to have all four limbs removed. The reasons for court hearings to determine disability are to figure out if you are disabled **from being able to work a job that actually provides you enough money to live**. Because I cannot sit or stand too long without wanting to blow my brains out, and due to the fatigue and depression issues stemming from sleep issues which in turn stem from the well documented medical issues I have, you would think that it makes sense that someone in my shoes really can't live a normal life. I still have all of my limbs, i can still walk, I can still run, I can still see... but can i sit or stand or even walk around 8 hours a day without being in extreme pain? No. 

Yet according to the judge's decisions

About 8 months ago, tosses stuff into dumpsters, cleaned up,  ran to the convenient store when needed... This lasted one full week at least 8 hours a day. I did this because I was and am tired of living like this and wanted to see how my body reacts to this sort of thing nowadays. I can tell you the experience was not at all enjoyable. Even after standing up there for an hour, my entire back, hamstrings, and feet felt like they had been beaten. My friend was  my boss, something I know for a fact would never be tolerated on any ""real"" job. Even relaxing through was not enough to quell the pain. I was so stiff and sore from practically just doing what any normal person would describe as nothing out of the ordinary. This surprised me because it's not like I am completely non active. I try and get to the gym regularly, in severe back

So meanwhile I have yet another claim in for disability and I have been relying on food stamps and $200 cash assistance from the state. This cash is now effectively gone with the new budget that Governor Corbett passed. With $200 monthly I could at least scrape by, when I do that, I will most likely have my food stamps cut down to practically nothing, which means I have to really put myself through some rigors now just to be worse off than I was beforehand. See, if I work 15 hours a week, I'll end up with something like $85-$90 bucks after taxes working minimum wage, so something like $360 monthly which is just slightly under what I had to my name every month with food stamps and cash assistance combined. So really it boils down to me not even being able to subject myself to pain and bust my ass within my limits to get *ahead*

I really have no hope anymore that anything is ever going to get fixed in this body of mine, and I don't see my condition in either a bodily or environmental sense improving before that thread breaks. Having this meager chump change taken away from me now just puts more tension on that thread.  

I really have no clue what to do now. I'm writing this and putting it up publicly because I really would like to hear people's advice. I also want people to know that there are indeed people out there like me that are truly in dire straits and need help to get by. This $200 chump change was a life saver for many people. I want people to know while there may be people abusing the welfare system, that is, if they even have a shred of empathy to get to that point to begin with. Of that, I'm not too hopeful.

She genuinely enjoys all those activities, we're finding that it's kind of expected by society for her to hang out with the lady despite usually not having anything in common. She's rather play video games with me and our guy friend than talk to the girl about...well whatever it is they generally want to talk to her about. They share very few interests. We don't really know what to do about it. My wife's not a jerk, so she doesn't just leave the girl to be bored and watch, but you see the dilemma.


We're also finding that it's hard for her to make guy friends. It seems to be a trend that one of two things happen; the guy wants to be friends until he realizes she only wants to be friends and it will never be anything more


**TLDR; My wife wants to be friends with people who share her interests


**EDITED TO INCLUDE IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION**
A very valid question from itsrachellolz:
&gt;""Man's girl?"" Uh. It's pretentious to assume she's so dudely/unlike girls because she likes certain things. That's a turnoff for lots of girls: is to meet some rando chick and not be able to relate to her because the girl she meets is so above her as if she ""wouldn't understand her interests because she likes boy things."" I dunno if she exudes this air

She definitely doesn't. This is something she struggles with internally and talks to me about. She hangs out with other girls frequently, and tries her best to invest in any topic they might bring up. ""Man's woman"" is a term I'm using because it's an easy descriptor, and she would certainly NEVER say anything like that especially not around another girl.

But thinking like that leads me to asking myself how much mental pain and suffering must he have been in if hanging himself was the ""best"" option in his mind. Would I be strong enough to climb out of that hole? I know in my heart that it's unfair to make any judgements here

Hurting or not, no apology, no explanation. His wife and kids deserved, at the very least, something.

I cycle through these feelings of deep anger and empathy practically from
minute to minute.

Then I put myself in my sister-in-laws shoes. How would I feel if my partner did the same thing? The horror is unthinkable. How could I not blame myself in some way?

I've always believed in monogamy. But over the past few months I've been dating a lot and questioning why monogamy is so important. Before I became single I didn't really give it much thought. Being monogamous was just a social norm. We are all naturally attracted to more than one person and have compatibility with more than one person. Do you think it's possible to have a healthy open honest relationship? Is monogamy fed by our own insecurities and selfishness? 

I read an interesting note of one of my FB friends'. She quoted that monogamy is a biological affair. Primates (whom we evolved from) had larger hip bones which enable them to give birth at later developmental stages which meant less parental care was needed. They were polygamist. Since humans have smaller hip bones we give birth at earlier developmental stages and this helps induce the act of monogamy due to the extensive parental care needed to ensure our children survive.

Tonight, as mentioned above was to get out of the car and pull the winner off of the loser before any serious injury could be done, but I considered the possibility that the winner might be in a rage, as well as a better fighter than me, and start swinging at anyone who touched him in that situation. I asked my friend what I should do and she simply replied, ""get out and watch?"" I ended up calling the police, but I always feel like calling the cops makes me look bad or something.

&gt;Someone took my phone. A Samsung Galaxy S3. It's white. It's only worth a few hundred bucks to you or anyone else. If you unlock the screen you will see my home screen. In the picture stands a man. A man with a backpack and 2 other bags. That man you see, his coffin. See, that man you saw on the home screen. The one who looks so eager to head into a war zone to protect the country he loved and his family, he lost his life doing so. The only pictures I have of him are on that phone because my computer crashed after I transferred them. Tonight, I cried uncontrollably in the arms of a friend because tonight I felt as though I lost my husband once more. I know with time my memory will fade. I will have difficulty explaining his features to his children. Or why I think they look like him. One who never had the honor of meeting his father. I don't care about the phone. If you have it. Please just email me. I will respond and you will be able to send them to my email and you will never hear from me again. I only want the pictures nothing else. The reward money is 100%. If you can prove to me you have the phone and are willing to give it back. Proof required: My husbands Eye color hair color and shirt color in the skype photo of him. Along with the type of cover that was on the phone. 


&gt;UPDATE: 5-16-2013

&gt;I wanted to post an update to this ad because unfortunately I do not have time to respond to each heartfelt email I have recently received. Most emails are asking about my old computer. Unfortunately after a trip to Best Buy and being told the data I was after was not retrievable I saw no harm in throwing away the computer. I had previously backed up the photos on my phone. They were not backed up after the computer crashed. I apologize for that misunderstanding. For those asking the general area where the phone was lost we were at a get together near Warrenton Road and Cambridge (Route 1) more in the Stafford side. I sincerely appreciate all of those reaching out and trying to help. Please keep in mind I am raising 2 kiddos alone and with end of the year things and field trips etc and one becoming very busy as a new toddler I am unable to thank each one of you. Please know you walk with us in our hearts in a very special place. 

&gt;For the person who emailed me saying they believe they know who has the phone please email me back. 
For those concerned about the money it is from my husband's life insurance policy and I am not walking around with a large sum of money. When you've lost someone so dear to your heart you begin to realize what matters and what does not. For this reason I am keeping a certain level of anonymity to maintain the surest level of my family's safety as I possibly can. 

&gt;After posting this I took time to reflect and came to peace with things. I was in complete hysterics when I wrote this and apologize for anything that may have been misunderstood or misconstrued I do have older photos from my In laws they have been gracious enough to copy for myself and grandchildren. Along with photos from professional photo sessions and emailed to relatives. In that moment that night it felt like everything had been ripped away. 

&gt;Thank you so much for the servicemen and women who have reached out to donate to the reward and offer their services. The only thing I ask for you is to stay safe and to come home. I can not take anymore than the selfless love you are already showing this wonderful country. For the gentlemen who served with my husband thank you so much for your kind words. I was very touched so thank you.

I'm trying to protect our identities

I'll start off with the **TLDR**

**Name key:**

* Micah = my boyfriend

* Max = my boyfriend's son

* Terry = my boyfriend's exgirlfriend of 4 years

* Caroline = Terry's bestfriend

* Connor = Terry's oldest son


**Some background information:**
Micah and Terry are split up and have been for years. Micah and I have been together for around 2 years and living together the whole time. Micah and Terry have joint custody and Micah has physical custody

So.
Friday afternoon, Micah and I are shocked. What happened?! We knew that Terry's bestfriend, Caroline, and her children had been living with Terry off and on for the past few weeks while Caroline is between houses/husbands. (Caroline and Terry are very close, by the way. They are like sisters, aunts to each other's children). 

So, and of course is trying to think of any other possibility. Caroline's son, Connor, is what you'd call a n'erdowell. So in our minds it's entirely possible that he stole something, and since he's living with Terry she got caught up in possession of stolen property? Maybe they found drugs on him and he's saying he got them from Terry, or maybe he's got drugs in her apartment? We don't know. Micah and I drove out to her town's police station to pick Max up, all the while trying not to think the worst. 
We arrive, we leave and we get Max in a talking mood and keep him distracted and don't worry about telling him what's going on because we don't even know yet. We get home and keep him on what would be a normal routine for the most part and put him to bed. Micah gets a call from Caroline, and she lays it all out for us.

The night before, on top of Terry. Caroline says she went and knocked Connor off Terry and snatched up his phone. Caroline finds all these dirty text messages between Terry and Connor. Terry and Connor have been trading explicit pictures, and beyond that, they are ""in love"". Caroline said she sat outside for hours crying. This was her BEST friend, they went on vacation together, picked up each other's children from school, they were living together at the moment! How could Terry do this? She's twice Connor's age, but I can't imagine how she felt that night. All those questions spinning in her head
Caroline says the next morning (Friday) she and Connor go the police station to turn Terry in, they find all the correspondance between them. While Terry and my stepson (he's my stepson to me, even if it's not legally true) arrive at her apartment after picking him up from school, the police arrest (no handcuffs though) Terry and take her and Max to the police station.

Caroline told us that Connor told the police everything. They are in love, and they've locked the door. Terry had been paying to keep Connor's phone on (so they could continue their relationship) even when Caroline had cut it off because of his disrespectful attitude and poor behavior in school. 
Caroline told us she's been charged (forgive me if that isn't the right word, possession of child pornography, contributing to the deliquincy of a minor and some other things possibly.

So here is were we're at. This all happened yesterday. Terry's bond hearing is Monday and we don't know if she's going to be able to get the money together (we're afraid she will) to get out. What happens next? We have to find a therapist for Max to find out if he was a victim, we don't want him over there ever again. Can she file charges or bring Micah to court if he denies her visitation based on what happened? I thought, once upon a time, I read somewhere that a parent can file for emergency custody and avoid the legal consequences of denying visitation so long as there was a sound reason. Like you think the child will come into harm if you let them go with the other parent.

Will be Micah be able to go for full custody now, jail time if there's any, etc.
Our main concern is Max. He's very close to his mother and losing her will be so tough. We want to be able to explain to him in a way he'll understand what is happening, as well. We are so worried how this is going to affect him. :(

I'm just at a complete loss. Can anyone answer any of those questions? Does anyone have any advice? A similar situation? Sorry if it's written like a chimp

Both my friend and I are recent college graduates (25 years olds) and earlier this summer he broke the news that his wonderful fiance is pregnant with a very unexpected bundle of joy.

I thought it would be a touching sentiment if I surprised him with an account/bonds/stocks/wampum to already start helping him prepare for his kid's college tuition. I'd be really grateful if anyone could weigh in on these questions: 

1. What will the cost of textbooks be in 2031?! I sorta think everything will be digital (or society will have collapsed in on itself)

article here: 
http://www.hometownannapolis.com/news/nbh/2012/03/08-16/Westboro-Baptist-to-protest-at-Glen-Burnie-High.html

Previous post by Martiamae here: 
http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/qne61/westboro_baptist_found_out_my_principal_is_gay/

I assisted in organizing the counter-protest to WBC last year when they came to Meade High School and it became a really phenomenal event.  We baked cookies and made posters and everyone sang Queen in unison and we had almost 400 attendees.  

This year I'd like to actually do something productive (and not share a video about an African child-army leader a zillion times).

I'd like to set up a table and take donations for Glen Burnie High school as well as other LGBT charities/organizations. Then after the ""counter-protest"" make the donation in the name of the Westboro Baptist Church. 

The reason I need reddit is because I'd like your input on which charities/organizations are the best to donate to (yes I am asking for your help in researching) not because I'm lazy but because I trust you guys and other than a Facebook event there is not much more I can do to raise awareness. 

I will try to speak to the same guy that interviewed me from the newspaper last year and start there but other than that I need help in spreading the word so I can better organize this and actually fund some organizations that the WBC targets.  Of course

At the very least something good would come out of the situation.

Im learning nothing new and I feel like life is passing me by. General attitude amongst some employee's is ""How is this office still operating?""

I'm 29

I just lost my license for 6 months and this has put me over the top.  I have sketched out a tentative plan. Load all my shit into a uhaul and go back to my parents when the lease is done at the end of June.  A small town away from the chaotic day to day bullshit of the city.  I'll also setup an office in the basement of my grandparents and have a place to crash at either.  I have plenty of friends I can move in with if needed.

I'll spend July camping

Mid August I plan to fly to Europe for a month, I plan to spend part of it working on some Android apps and do some coding that I'd like to do if I had the time. 

Without getting into the details(I have a spreadsheet) I estimate that I'll have $25, worst case scenario is $15,000.

A lot of people tell me I shouldn't do it and I should be thankful I have a job.  It's actually gotten to me and I'm nervous about following through.  I hate the area I live in and it makes me depressed.  When I leave here

Have I thought this through enough?  Has anyone done anything like this?  Am I destined to fail?  I think I just need to make sure I'm not totally fucking up or overlooking something.

  My chest looks about that strange
 

  I've always been extremely self-conscious about my chest. I refuse to wear t-shirts in public unless forced (like for a job uniform--trying to work while constantly wondering if people can see my chest is pretty taxing every day.) I have worn hoodies and jackets over long-sleeved shirts outside on ninety degree days. 
 

  According to doctors
 

  I've looked into the surgery, and I don't think I can afford to leave my job for as long as it would take for me to recover. What I'm wondering is, is there anything else I can do to minimize the noticeability of my chest? Are there any prostheses for men with this condition? A lot of the less-invasive help out there seems to be more for women, who can sometimes mask the condition with breast implants or bra inserts.
 
  Anyway

They've been fighting all summer about various things. The start of all this was me forgetting to wash my hands before touching the fridge. My Dad decides to yell. So I just go over to the sink and he keeps going ect. This is semi-normal behaviour I replied with ""Don't give me the lecture"" and he goes upstairs and threatens to break something I own. This is the norm for his rants. As always

From there he's taken it as an opening to pretty much claim that my Mum has turned all 3 of us kids (23, but he gets angry and thinks he'll be right about everything or claim stupid things. It's been a problem for a while now. This summer has been the worst though. 

They cancelled and re-booked their holiday and now they've both said as soon as I go back to uni they're about to have a long talk about everything. In all honesty I think this more means my Dad yelling at my Mum for stuff she has or hasn't done. They're multiple stories which I won't go into unless reddit requires moar.

She has been the most selfless parent I could imagine, I've found out that she's been racking up debts to support us having as close to an 'average' life as possible (I guess technically we're in  'relative poverty'). Even things like school trips would put huge dents in her budgets... And I feel so guilty because for the first term of university my loan didn't come through and she had to support me (which hurt her finances especially because she no longer recieves child support for me). Today I found out she's even been using multiple 'quick loan' websites, the ones that cover you until your next payday but charge huge amounts of interest, to cover her monthly defecit.

To top it all off

It's absolutely heartbreaking, where I'm living of government grants (which only just covers things) And my older brother (who now earns more than her) is too much of a cunt to send her money and she would never ask him for any.

Below are the emails thus far:

**Scammer:** Hello! I'm Mr. Subhash Deshpande from Taiwan. Please can i have your attention?
Thanks
Mr. Subhash

**Me:** Sure
Just wondering where you got my email from tho lol

**Scammer:** Thank you very much for your respond. I am Mr. Subhash Deshpande an Indian nationality and an account officer with the International bank of Taipei (Now Bank SinoPac of Taipei) Taiwan. Let me give you a detailed description of what is in this transaction for us. In June 2003,500,000,000.00 TWD) for 18 calendar months, this is valued to Forty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars($44.5 Million USD) only in my branch. Upon maturity several notices were sent to him, even during the war (U.S and Iraqi war), Eight years ago (2004). Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later found out that Muhammad Al-Hakim and his family had been killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit his home at Mukaradeeb where his personal oil well was. 

http://www.iraqbodycount.org
http://www.iraqbodycount.net/ names.htm

After further investigation it was also discovered that Muhannad Al-Hakim did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So

Against this backdrop

WHAT IS TO BE DONE? 
I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary documents that will back you up as the next of kin to Muhammad Al-Hakim 

Full Name: 
Contact Address: 
Occupation:
 
After you have been made the next of kin

There is no risk involved at all in this matter as we are going to adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavour to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me

Finally after that I shall provide you with more details of this operation. Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.
 
Kind Regards

Most of these people are declaring that the only thing standing in the way of America's economy starting its pace again is more job creation. I don't understand their logic.

The way I see it

Most of the new jobs that are created thanks to the federal government are cheap temporary positions in building new infrastructure. I don't think this is going to help our economy in the long run. Those workers aren't going to have their jobs forever unless we keep pumping out stimulus packages

We are all aware of the burgeoning income disparity between the social classes but it feels like we aren't tackling the real problems. Plenty of jobs still exist in this country. The problem isn't a lack of work to go around but a lack of compensation. Flooding the market with  more jobs is going to help people make more money

This is really frustrating for me.

The issues arose when my first landlord sold to another property owner. The new owner's letter basically said, and they told me that they didn't get the deposits from the previous landlord, so they wouldn't be able to return them to any of the tenants. I called the previous landlord and he verified, and forwarded paperwork proving, that the new landlord was paid a large sum intended to cover the deposits for all the tenants in all the rentals.
They continue to maintain that they didn't receive the deposits and ""probably won't"" be returning them to anyone

I've had others issues with them... for example, and some other property of mine, and told me forwardly when asked that they did so), as well as not fixing issues in the apartment.

The newest issue is that they've decided to raise the rent. It's mid month, what should I do with this? Presumably my lease with the previous landlord means squat, and they never had us sign new ones, I believe under the vague suggestion that the previous lease was still in effect. I can't handle the extra 10%, some months I'm fine, to the point that I go ahead and save up enough to cover the next month or two, other months I make almost nothing (I'm a freelancer).

I share an office at work with a woman. This woman is nice. Too nice. Here’s the thing, she’s not offensive at all. But she’s one of the most boring people alive. She doesn’t joke about, doesn’t “turn off” from work (ie. tells you that she’s going home to do work, talks shop) she also tells you what she’s doing at all times just in case you were wondering. Which I never am. She tells horrifically boring stories, like how she couldn’t get parked in the supermarket car park because of a lorry so she turned round and went to a different shop. That one she literally just told me as I was typing this out.

There’s about eight of us who are working away from our homes, she joins the gym. I say I fancy a meal, she fancies a meal. I fancy not having a meal but just grab something at the supermarket or whatever for evening meal, she wants to do the same. I don’t mind, but god its like shooting Bambi’s mother again and again whenever you tell her that you just want to do something on your own tonight.

Over lunch we begin to discuss gay marriage which he says he is against for moral reasons. I told him that he had no right forcing others to subscribe to his personal morals legally. I added that gay marriage should be seen as a civil rights issue instead of a moral one because of the separation of church and state. 

His response was that if gay marriage is passed as a civil rights issue he could be sued or even jailed for refusing to marry a gay couple for personal religious issues. He said that he did not care if gay couples married but he felt that if he voted for it he would lose his freedom of religion to disagree with the choice the couple was making. 

This is not some distant paranoia he is feeling either. There are accounts of pastors being sued

Is it possible to maintain the civil eights of one group and also keep the constitutional freedoms of another?

I always tell myself it doesn't bother me if I piss people off.  You can't please everybody.  But it is starting to bother me.

It occurs to me that one way to know you're an asshole is if you don't care whether you piss people off.  Hm.

Anyway, ""Is it me?""

I usually feel I'm in the right and the pissed off person is in the wrong

So let me tell you what happened tonight and you tell me if I was being an asshole.  Maybe I'm just missing something.  Or maybe I have the wrong attitude about people or something.

This isn't a dramatic story.  In fact

I should say I'm a guy in his early 40s.  I'm fat and ugly and not usually very sociable.  I wasn't always this way.  I had my glory years, and staying healthy is too much damn work.

Anyway, behind her and ahead of me, but with no groceries.  The guy is holding a $20 bill.

As we stand there, teenage girls appear at the back of the line and call to the couple in front of me.  The two girls are each waving a pint of ice cream above their heads and saying something about can they join the couple ahead of me and buy it all together or something.  The two girls move past me and place their two pints of ice cream in front of my stuff and start talking to the couple.

Now

But then the guy kind of brushes them off saying he's just going to get change for his $20 and he doesn't want to ""join"" in their purchase or whatever they were suggesting.

So the two girls and the young woman (who is the other half of the couple in front of me) hand some money back and forth so the two girls have the money they need to buy their ice cream.

Then the guy is talking to the cashier getting his change for the twenty

Now, the girls just cut in front of me like I wasn't there (and one more woman who was behind me).

I say, although she never said anything that I know of).

Everybody is real quiet at this point.  I don't feel awkward

So, they've accepted that they don't belong in front of me, and now we can all get on with our lives.

They ring my stuff up quickly

In the parking lot, ""In a hurry to go eat?  Starving?  In a real hurry, are you?""

It's the woman

She says

I say

She says something else but I don't remember what it was.

I get in my car and start navigating through the parking lot only to find them pursing me.  All four of them in one car.  The woman is driving and flipping me off while motioning for me to roll down my window.  I see the two girls in the back seat laughing and flipping me off.  I smile and give them a thumbs up and turn away down a lane in the lot.

They follow me and cut me off at the other end of the parking lot.  They're shouting things but I can't hear

Now

To me

But I asked myself why I should stand there and do nothing when I was being rudely dismissed by inconsiderate people.  That's how I felt

I don't even think I would be asking myself this question if it didn't seem like things like this are always happening to me.

But maybe I just need to get over myself.  And maybe I don't see what is obvious to everyone else.  Maybe I'm getting agitated about things that others let slide.

But I don't feel like I'm the one who made it a big deal.  I just wasn't going to shrink in the face of rude behavior

I didn't say anything rude to anybody

And, ""Is it okay we cut in front of you?"" then everything would have been fine.  I would have said, ""No problem.""

But I still feel like an asshole.  Am I?

I'm 29, but I make enough for me to live comfortably for the moment. And that is very much the heart of my problem. I'm so comfortable that I don't really have very much drive to improve upon my situation. I'm content. 

I moved into my father's basement with the idea that I'd do volunteer work to improve my resume. My goal was to get a job teaching English overseas, I was very vocal in my hatred of the youth. 

I really just want to travel. Nothing makes me happier than the ground flying by beneath my feet. I would love a career that I could do from anywhere

I've also limited myself a bit with some bad life choices. My GPA was just good enough to graduate at a 2.0, which means it will never go away. Pilot was one of my dream jobs, but, as I understand it, I'll never get a pilot's license with a DUI on my record. 

My other dream jobs include; Doctor, or all around computer guru. If I were a doctor, I'd join Doctors without Boarders as soon as I graduated and without hesitation. I'd just want to hop from village to village and provide medical services whereever needed. If I were to get into a grad program I could turn my useless BA in Psychology into a somewhat useful Masters or PHD. I love academia, and all my friends that are in grad school tell me how much I would enjoy it. Although, I've never been anything more than a straight C student. What I think are the more realistic options are to try to break into journalism, or gather a host of certifications to become an IT guy. I'm just not sure where to get started with either of those. 

I have an insane amount of time on my hands during the week

So Reddit

Edit- Also note, I forgot to mention I get to surf reddit all day at work. Pretty sweet, huh?

Edit2- It's probably also important to note that I have money. I've got a trust fund that will come to full fruition on my next birthday. Last I checked I was worth somewhere between 100k and 200k in stocks and land. Pre 2008,False,,t5_2qhlj,1368327063.0,,,t3_1e5v5s

I will start with a little bit of a background story.  My fiance moved to Canada (Nova Scotia) in May 2012.  He is from the Philippines and moved to Canada for work.  He ended up working at the same place as I and also living in the same apartment building.  We fell in love around 2 months after he moved and we haven't been apart since.  In December

However

We have approximately 2 more months to get his work permit.  After that, because he is a valued employee.

My fiance and I started talking about different solutions to the problem and marriage came up.  We know we are going to get married eventually, because he will be a citizen of Canada.  However, we are wondering if this is the best course of action to take?  Will it help his chances of staying in Canada or will he have to go back to the Philippines anyways?

So

TLDR; My fiance's work permit has been rejected two times and we fear that he will not get it.  Therefore,,False,,t5_2qhlj,False,,True

Marcus retaliated by suing him under New Jersey's version of the Stored Communications Act. The jury voted in favor of Rogers, since he didn't actually actively go searching for the emails -- they were just there, in full view.

#2 - After thoroughly going through the whole apartment closing windows

#3 - I have deduced that the gnats are literally coming through the floorboards (wonder if the possible sewage stench had anything to do with it). There are parts of the hardwood that aren't completely sealed

#4 - I can't sleep. I'm still up. They're everywhere. I'm being constantly violated in my own home and I have nowhere to escape to.

- He may not have any self esteem or be socially awkward. (Im not sure because he is never down on himself nor acts like he is confident.)

My husband has been approached about possibly taking a position overseas. The money is fantastic

My ex-husband may pose a bit of a problem

As it stands he sees my children (8) for a brief stint during the summer

His involvement with them is abysmal at best

My husband (their stepfather)

Now

I have a feeling that this offering of money will make him more open to this idea



TLDR; Want to take kids overseas if my husband takes a new job; how do I get the ex to agree to it?? 

EDIT:  This was originally posted to get advice on how to get my ex-husband to agree to let me take my children overseas if an opportunity for a job pans out. I was never asking advice on whether or not this was the best decision for my children. I am the only one that can make that decision, or form a lawyer....in my head (and I admit that I may be wrong) if we agree to it between ourselves and he gives me written permission to take the children - there is no reason whatsoever to have lawyers become involved. There is no garnishment of his wages in place - he simply transfers the money from his bank account to mine on the 1st and 15th of the month.  He has skipped payments before (with my permission) and we certainly didn't need a lawyer to modify the support agreement those times.

Seems like this is a hot button issue for some of you

IF this job opportunity comes to fruition and IF we feel that this is the all around best decision that can be made...only then will this be pursued.

At this stage here is what has happened - my husband has been approached by his current employer with the possibility of a position overseas. He and I have discussed it and agreed that we are open to it. He has told his employer that we are open to the opportunity and to keep him posted on the details.

There has been no formal offer and no plans are in motion at this time. We are in the pre-pre-pre-planning stage.",,t5_2qhlj,1369331246.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/1eurpp/how_do_i_go_about_getting_my_exhusband_to_allow/

I had to clean the rental before could even move in and no discount on rent. In the one bedroom the fan was destroyed so there was no light in that room for two weeks until the landlord replaced it with a cheap light no fan &amp; no a/c that room sucks now. 
The furnace broke down three weeks after moving in and again about a month ago. The freezer has broken twice and I lost all my food because the landlord hires his buddies to fix things. The water hose for my washing machine was raining on the electrical boxes when we turned it on (then off). My closet door is still not screwed in to anything. My son's closet the light is broken and smells like cigarettes even though this is supposed to be a non-smoking apartment. Today I came home to the basement filled with a quarter to half inch of water and feces floating around my washing machine. My son is staying at my parents tonight for this reason. I informed the landlord when I discovered this and he's left a message with a plumbing company. As for the maintenance this is the last straw.

When I moved in there was a longtime tenant who worked a lot so that was fine. She ran out on her lease telling me ""good luck"". Now the neighbors upstairs moved in about four moths ago

My ex-girlfriend and I were together for a year and a half during college, and also do some temporary work with another company that will shine on my resume. We agreed to end the relationship on a high note rather than see it spiral slowly downward over the distance and crash when I moved overseas.

Our relationship was nearly perfect. It was filled with love, like self-confidence issues and a reluctance to use English (her second language) in social situations. Most importantly, I helped her get over her physical inhibitions stemming from sexual abuse she suffered as a child. It was a long, slow and emotional process, but we were patient and understanding with each other. It brought us closer together, and by the end of the relationship were both deeply in love with one another. (This account is a throwaway because my friends know my main one, and if they recognize it this would out her as an abuse victim. That's not my call to make.)

It's been five weeks since we broke up, a guy she goes to school with asked her out. Two weeks after that, they had their first date. One week later, she contacts me over Facebook chat and explains that not only did she go out with the guy, but she proudly announces that she slept with him on the second date and asked for advice on whether to start a relationship with him.

During the past five weeks, and her most of all. So needless to say, it felt like a punch in the gut when she told me (in great detail) about her feelings for him.

I understand her reasons for going to me about this — I know her better than anyone else and she feels comfortable talking to me about these things. She isn't malicious enough to want to rub this in my face. And I'm not trying to shame her for sleeping with the guy so quickly; it's her life and I don't have a claim to her anymore. I was a good friend and calmly told her that I wasn't the best person to ask for that particular situation. But after finding out I've been replaced so easily and her sending me a picture of us right afterward to joke about her posture

So, or asked for your help, in good faith but wound up making things worse for you.

My campus is fairly religious (Christian), speaks as if they assume you believe in God).

There is an all-male organization on campus that goes by the acronym GOD (pronounced ""jee-oh-dee"" as to avoid sacrilege, and as you will see, not all of my peers see them that way). They also boast about having great connections; those who graduated from the club will be happy to help those in the club get a leg-up in the real world.

My roommate Chris and I decided not to apply, did, and got in. He spent a week being hazed (outlawed on our campus) by being made to drink a bunch of alcohol throughout the week. Now, obviously this is problematic for many reasons, not list of which is that there are people with VERY LOW ALCOHOL TOLERANCE who may not even be aware of this low tolerance because they make a habit of abiding by the national drinking age law. Luckily, this was not the case this year (although apparently it was in a previous year, when the club was suspended for the rest of that year). Anyway, Rob did not feel or look so well, I made no plans to tell anyone (one of those things that's common knowledge among students but escapes the staff), and I didn't want to have to deal with the complications of being the one to tell (judge me on whether or not this is a good call

Two friends of Chris's, but were kicked out soon enough for being gay (James is not gay, though I confess I assumed he was as well). 

THIS outrages me to the point that it is not something that I cannot stand idly by and accept. This is discrimination at its purest, I acknowledge that just because I don't care what happens to me, that James and Ryan should feel the same way. I also imagine that, should I tell someone and GOD does get punished for it, it wouldn't be that hard to deduce that James and Ryan were related to their problems (there can't have been that many gay students they kicked out just this year). I don't know how to deal with this, but I can't just do nothing either. Please help, Reddit :/

I applied for an apartment in April and didn't hear anything back from them for 3 weeks, and things became worry-some.  

I should start by saying this is a complex of apartments


On July 15th they told me I could come in and finish the paperwork for the apartment, sign the lease, and get new keys.  I sign the lease and pay the security deposit and the first months Pro-rated rent.  At this time I go to try the keys again....again they do not work.  I go back to the apartment office and tell them.  They say they are going to get the lock redone, and I can pick the keys up Friday and move in.  I go on Friday, and they say that I can not actually move in because it has not been inspected by the Fire department.  Move in was set for Monday now.  However, that if I wanted to go ahead and move my stuff into the apartment that would be fine....but that I was not allowed to live there.  I couldnt do that since my lock wasnt working, however, I have no keys, however

Reddit.  I have a signed lease

Is there anything I should do?  Anything I need to do?  I really need this apartment since i currently live with my wife in my parents basement but i believe renting a place that hasn't been inspected or cleared is illegal.  What do I do....or should I just keep my mouth shut?

I'm horrible at writing things like this, bear with me.)

I am a 24 yr old dreamer from a large, I have been drawing/creating/dreaming up things. I have quite a niche for seeing things other people can't see, and bringing out the treasure in what would otherwise be seen as trash. (I'm horrible at articulating what I'm trying to say though, as you can probably tell...) While I excelled in my job at the call center, being promoted to a Supervisor position within the first 6 months, I was also absolutely miserable with my life and the lack of creation involved in the work. I eventually developed extreme anxiety issues, and came to realize that life wasn't worth living if you were doing something you hate doing. But, I decided to try to make money off of my creative abilities.

(I'm not sure if this is the best place to start a new paragraph, fixing it up for my siblings as gifts, and using the photos as a portfolio for my possible business. After posting a few things I'd done for free, I slowly got messages from people who wanted me to do things for them, and was able to make a little money. When I say little, I mean people in this town basically wanted me to work for free. I'm never sure how much to charge for things, rather then the basic ""supplies"", I painted a firetruck dresser for a lady for $50, but I realized at the end of the week that after buying what I needed I was down $30

Flash forward to today, with my new boyfriend in a small apartment. I've been up here for 7 months now, and have decided to give it one more shot at getting started in some sort of business before I go back to a dreaded life of call center hell. I've created a Facebook page, shared as much as possible, advertised on craigslist, and printed up flyers and advertised at all the local community bulletins. Unfortunately, I haven't gotten any responses. I think mainly it's because I'm not sure what to advertise, but I'd love to hear some suggestions. Please, I want to make this work.
