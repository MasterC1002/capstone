I would like to voice my concern about the large amount of Fondant posts in this subreddit lately. 

I know that people work hard on them, but 95% of them are storebought fondant that the person posting has shaped in an aesthetically pleasing (or less pleasing) way.

  I would like to question their value in a baking subreddit


 I thought that /r/baking focused on an actual baking process
For all i know can the cake underneath that proudly displayed fondant be a box mix

  I come here to gather ideas for my next baking adventure
