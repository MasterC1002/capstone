**A new way we keep track of your progress**

It’s easy to forget the material in all the skills you’ve “mastered” when you don’t practice. That’s why we’re rolling out a new way to help you track your learning better. 

Now, instead of seeing hearts in the notebooks once you’ve finished a lesson you’ll see a ‘strength bar’ that shows your average word strength. At a glance, you’ll be able to see what your weakest skills and lessons are and be able to practice them. The more you practice your weakest words, the more complete the bar will become, and the better you’ll know the language.

One thing to mention is that if we make the switch

**Real-world translations**

One of the main goals of learning a language is being able to apply it to real world materials. We want the real world content to fit naturally into the learning process

Rather than seeing real-world documents inside each skill, there will now be a “Real world practice” that will give you real world sentences that exercise the words you have learned much better.

We’ll continue testing these updates with new users over the next week or so. In the meantime

^(**DISCLAIMER: this bit basically explains how the education system works**)

In British secondary schools (ages 12-16 and grade/year-group 7 to 11) we get an accreditation called GCSEs. Usually after we get our GCSEs we use them to apply prove that we're knowledgable enough in our subjects to take up A-levels in sixth form. Sixth form lasts for two years

So if I took *GCSE* German Language and got an A or B I would be able to apply to a sixth form to do *A-level* German Language. You then use your A-levels to get into university (aka college in American English)

So 

* ----&gt; Secondary School gets you GCSEs
* ----&gt; Sixth form gets you A-levels
* ----&gt; University gets you a diploma ---&gt; Profit?

^(**DISCLAIMER END**)

Ok, a few evening classes ^((they're overrated)^) and Livemocha, but nothing really substantial. I had a basic head for some of the simple grammar from Michel Thomas, but that was pretty much it. However, I recently walked over to my school's language department and asked if I could start an A-level in the next year. So she said if I could prove that my German language was that of a GCSE student, she'd happily let me on the course. I was then handed some past papers and asked to fill them out and hand them back in after a week. I did and got roughly a B and will start the A-level in September.

So because of Duolingo (and some other sources) I've been able to sidestep years of Secondary School education in foreign languages and jump straight in at the interesting part.

**IMPORTANT: I'm only about half way through the Duolingo course with coins:2

This is partly a testament to how easy Secondary School Education is, but I understand a good amount of the grammar and can actually say somethings, which is more than can be said for a lot of people who use the normal school route. My German's still full of mistakes and there's tons I do not know, but yeah, it's definitely something. Feel free to ask me anything. ",,False,t5_2t6ze,True

The main idea is to give more emphasis to reading real documents in the language you're learning. Instead of dropping you in the middle of a document and asking you to translate a randomly selected sentence as we did before

Some of the sentences in the document may already have a translation from a community member. If you put your mouse over one of these, this won't always be possible because there is not an exact correspondence between the words in the original language and the translation). We want to give you the tools to understand the article in your new language. Here's what this looks like: [http://imgur.com/ZKxtfBz](http://imgur.com/ZKxtfBz)

For each sentence, the sentence turns green to indicate that you've read it and understood it. You get points for going over each sentence :)

I started doing Spanish on April 1 as a complete beginner and I finished the lessons on May 24. I now estimate that I am at level  A1 on the CEFRL scale (CEFRL has 6 levels with A1 being the lowest and C2 being the highest). I probably know about 500 Spanish words pretty well and can somewhat comfortably have an EXTREMELY BASIC Spanish conversation (""Hello!"" ""Where is the bathroom?"" ""I am American."" etc etc) and understand most Spanish signs and simple text that has a  limited vocabulary (childrens books

NOTES:
(1) Duolingo is absolutely addictive compared to traditional methods like books. I would often neglect my real work to work on getting more points on Duolingo. Three of the factors that contribute to this are (i) The short lessons each of which can be done in 5-10 minutes (ii) The immediate feedback on mistakes (iii) The social aspect of competing for points.

(2) Don't expect too much

(3) Don't RUSH. I made the mistake of rushing to finish as fast as possible and I think because of that I didn't master some points as well as I would have if I had taken it slower.

(4) Related to (3)

(5) It is harder to get motivated to do the translations after you have completed the ""game tree"" especially if you are still not fluent so you struggle with the translations. I am still working on this.

&gt; Hello Duolingo

&gt; My name is Joshua Smolders

&gt; There is one aspect of your language learning model, I have found myself again and again unsure of which vowel or consonant was being pronounced and having to look it up in an online dictionary. While the computerized voice is fairly high quality, it alone cannot replace the training garnered by listening to and getting the feedback of a native speaker.

&gt; I believe the ambiguity in pronunciation of certain words and the absence of native-speaker training could be alleviated by adding two things to your current system: 1) an initial lesson on the sound system. 2) an option to view the pronunciation of any word or phrase (transcribed using the international phonetic alphabet).

&gt; Concerning the first, especially focusing on sounds that do not occur in the learner's own language. You could also have ""hearing practice"", where a vowel or consonant is given in a monosyllabic word and the user must identify the correct vowel phoneme. I believe such an addition would be of great benefit for improving the quality of spoken second language acquisition (as opposed to just written language acquisition) for your product.

&gt; Concerning the second, but it would also be doing a great service to the online world in terms of the standardization of pronunciation keys. Most online dictionaries and encyclopedic websites have already begun integrating IPA, and language learning websites and programs should consider following suit.

&gt; I hope you have found these ideas helpful. Thank you for considering them and I wish you the best of luck with your enterprise.

&gt; Sincerely

&gt; Joshua Smolders",,t5_2t6ze,False,,french,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/duolingo/comments/1fu5y7/interesting_suggestions_on_improving/

HOWEVER: I know a HECK of a lot more Spanish than when I started! My vocabulary is pretty good and I can get the gist of almost any Spanish text. I can understand audio if they speak slowly (unfortunately most don't!)

As far as writing :

Quizas es mejor a dar un ejemplo de mi nivel de escribiendo. No es tan mal, asi que el vocabulario no es problema. Los accentos son un problema : siempre los me olvidos! También los tenses son difícil - ¡especialmente el subjunctivo! Me escribio este y no consulta un diccionario o otro recurso para realmente mostrar la situación actualmente :-)

[Free Translation : 
Perhaps it's better to give an example of my writing level. It's not that bad, so vocabulary is not a problem. The accents are a problem: I always forget them! Also the tenses are difficult - especially the subjunctive! I am writing this and not consulting a dictionary or other resource in order to really show the current situation :-) ]

As part of our ongoing efforts to improve Duolingo we're running a study to measure how well people learn with the site (and how well they learn certain topics). To do this we're running a study in which we compare the test results of users before and after using Duolingo.

We need beginner users of Spanish that:

- Have not advanced beyond Basics 2

- Are willing to commit to using Duolingo for 30 hours.

- Are willing to give us basic demographical data.

What you get:

- A chance to take the WEBCape placement test in Spanish -- twice!

- A $20 Amazon gift card.

If you're interested

* Fast
* Beautiful UI
* Great sounds
* Smooth performance
* Makes really easy to get through lessons successfully. Possibly moves faster than online (especially loading times
* Has a warning message if you navigate away mid-lesson
* Tried it on data
* No annoying bugs
* Did I mention this app was beautiful? And no ads etc. to annoy you!


Still some things missing

* Cannot send feedback in-lesson like you can online. i.e. if you think you're right.
*  ~~No real-world translations. Obviously this is in the works, and it's useful to see the other translations to see how a certain phrase or word that is repeated in the article is translated by other users.
* Don't seem to be able to connect/view other people/followers. (Also probably in progress)
* It seems to log you off when you lose internet connection, behavior when you get logged out is a little strange. For example, if you don't have internet and you try to log in, it says ""Username incorrect"" instead of notifying you that your internet connection isn't on. Lots of apps manage this quite well, not sure why duolingo can't do the same.
* Doesn't seem to remember the settings for no daily reminder. Every time I return to that screen it still says ON
* Would be nice to be able to see weekly progress like you can online
* Would be nice to view the vocab page and access the timed practices
* Would be nice if it didn't take the full screen during lessons - i.e. it hides the clock, but it seems like there's enough space for it, just that they decided to include a black margin and graphics that make it look like real pages stacked on top of each other (which is very nice, but maybe can achieve both?)

My Thoughts:

The Duolingo Spanish course is **fantastic** for about three-quarters of the skill tree.  When I say that it is the most complete course that I have found so far, many of the verb sections tend to become a little ambiguous, and I was routinely left unsure of how to translate sentences with little to no explanation.  

The most glaring example of this was the Subjunctive Past, I most likely would not have made it through the section.  Fleshing out this and other sections would be extremely beneficial to ensure that the learner has a consistently rewarding experience.  Furthermore, I believe that the social aspect of Duolingo needs to be expanded.  Group chats, forums, utilization of Google Hangouts, and forming competitive teams would all help the learners to improve upon their speaking skills, while also adding an even more addictive and game-like element to the site.

Thank you all very much for your efforts. I am amazed that you have been able to do what you have, to my country, and to me in trying to understand other people. 

I have just completed and mastered all the lessons in the Spanish Language tree after 8 months on the site. I saw the opening and have been with Spanish from the Beta. I managed to get 8 of my friends to join DuoLingo and 3 of them are sticking with it. Finishing and 'mastering' DuoLingo Spanish was a goal on 6 month's list and I am very proud to say I accomplished it. Along with that I was able to translate just north of 300 sentences for the world. After a short break for the holidays I am setting my sights on Italian in preparation for the Goldschmidt Geology Conference in Florence in August. I am hungry for more. 

So, Thorns and Buds' after a hike or meeting to discuss the good things, the bad things and the things we hoped to do next time. I will employ this technique for feedback. I want to warn, that I have only experience in the Spanish Tree, that I did not use the voice recognition part of the site due to lack of hardware, so my experience is colored by that. My Previous experience in Spanish was for 3 years in high school, listening to Spanish language radio for 3 months before a 2 week vacation to Argentina a year ago, I tend to use it to talk to people. 


Roses:

* Going home for the holidays means siting in planes and smiling at the Rosetta Stone adds on the back of SkyMall. They price their 5 programs per language at $400 and I paid nothing for mine. DuoLingo being free and committing to being free is ludicrous. You are all crazy. I love it. I am amazed by it. I rave about you all every chance I get and I try to recommend you as much as I can to anyone trying to learn a language. The no-cost approach is just amazing
* Going home also means lots of waiting. But I can still practice my DuoLingo on the phone at the airport. What an amazing thing! I can actually do real work, while waiting for friends, at the bar, in bed, and when my computer is on my desk too. I love the mobile version.
* The typing algorithms are good at seeing my typos
* The audio in the Spanish version is great. The woman was clear
*The sentences in general were of use
* The feedback button is amazing. I try to leave feedback, an understated but invaluable tool.  
* Let me say this again: THE FEEDBACK BUTTON IS AMAZING. It really makes me think why other places do not have a similar system. It seems so obvious to me now
* I was originally wary of the timed practice, I feel great. 
* DuoLingo is easy to use and very friendly. I like the look of it. Whoever is doing your webdesign
* The POINTS! ERMAHGERD! I need more points! This was a great system that you implemented. I am easily able to gauge my daily progress based on the points. I usually limited myself to south of 100 points a day
* Finally, and to contribute, in a small way, to the world. I am able to live my scout oath through DuoLingo, I can say that helped other people, that I left the world better than I found it each day. 

Thorns:

* The audio speed
* When I was near the heart loss limit for a lesson
* The lack of vos/vosotros and other regional variations was notable. I know you are providing Spain Spanish
* The typo recognition still needs work
* The vocab needs to be played more. I really know what a manzana is now
* I found myself bailing on a lesson and restarting when I got a heart off in the first 3 questions. If I didn't it would be 'wasted' time and I found I rarely could finish and pass a lesson if I got one wrong in the first 3. It was really frustrating and I had to rage-quit DuoLingo a dozen times because of this. Still
* I almost never used the correct letters. An á was never typed as such and I always got the warning but never missed points. I assume you are grappling with this issue
* Ok, but you need a gigantic 'congratulations' page when I get to a key-hole or learn or master all the lessons above one. And especially at the end when I mastered the whole tree. I mean, come on guys, I got 10,000 points and no special email at least!? I had to manually screen grab a page and post it to FaceBook. I wanted a huge splash page like when I master a lesson, with the little trumpet and everything! I wanted crummy .gif effects like in Solitare.
* I used the keyholes as personal markers for my progress. I would go out to a restaurant when I reached one and order drinks in terrible Spanish. I used them as benchmarks for my progress in the skills tree and I thought they were. I was disappointed when I didn't have a special thing when I reached them and that I had to invent one myself. I wanted more interaction there. 
* The pacing in general is a bit aggressive now. I do not feel that I have 'mastered' a lesson
* The social aspect of is lacking too. All I can do is to see how many points my friends have. I will be fair and say I almost never used the FaceBook Linking part, I wanted more interaction with my friends on DuoLingo. I wanted to taunt them with the point chest I acquired that day, and feel bad at all the points they got that morning. I wanted to see if I had a better translation than them. I wanted to compete a bit with them.
* The translations, I know, I talked of morality earlier, but I have to be honest here. I BS'd my way through rating some of the translations. I would read about 3 words in and then decide if the translation was right or not. Not much more. I took solace in thinking that others would catch the mistakes and I could hide in the noise.
* The translations in general, I used it a lot. Still, they were not a highlight of the learning experience for me, I liked the 'drill and kill' of the lessons better. 
* Also
* With a lack of lessons and goals for myself that DuoLingo presents, 20,00 points, 2000 sentences, etc. You should give me a clearer goal now that i have finished the tree. I still want to help.

1355463391.0,14tvsl,My one month review of Duolingo,Chodarth,33,3,30,"I started using Duolingo the day the iPhone app came out. I've been studying Portuguese Beta (almost) everyday since then for about an hour a day.



While I like the fact that it makes me want to come back and keep doing it everyday I've found that it's probably not the best way to learn a language (for me).



I haven't tried any of the other languages so I can only comment on the Portuguese Beta version. I think the computer voice is terrible but from what I've read they paid a lot of money for it and it's not going to be replaced. I wish they could do some sort of crowd sourced audio like Rhinospike.com where native users upload the sentence/word audio for the lessons. You could offer people points for uploading audio (from their iphone!?) and let other users rate the quality. Another reason this would be great is that there could be several different versions of each sentence/word with different accents and male/female voices! 



I've managed to reach level 11 in the Portuguese Beta in this past month. I don't know if I will continue to use it as I feel that I would have learned a lot more by learning on my own but the fact of the matter is



Below is a link to screenshots I've taken from my phone with about 90 different mistakes I've found while doing Portuguese Beta this past month. There were more than this but I did some lessons on the PC and didn't take any screenshots. Some of these might not be wrong but they sure fooled me.



[Duolingo Portuguese Beta Errors](http://imgur.com/a/vtPuA#0)



I think what I finally realized is that Duolingo's ultimate goal is to translate the internet. I do not want to be a translator. I want to be able to speak and understand Portuguese. Duolingo is designed to get it's users to translate from their target language into their native language. Yes





Maybe I should wait for Portuguese to be out of Beta? If you've completed or gotten far in any of the other languages that aren't in Beta how did you like it?



This is in no way intended to bash Duolingo

1370474957.0,1fr74e,3 small suggestions for 3 big improvements,Jonaszz,24,3,4,"The timed mode is a great addition to Duolingo


###*1. Tick tick tick boom*
##*After entering a wrong answer the time keeps ticking.*

If I want to analyse what I did wrong this is being penalised. This actually leads to me skipping the step of analysing what I did wrong just to go for the score. I think I am not the only one who makes this

###*2. Our time is running out*
##*In timed mode it never lets you finish the last question halfway through if time runs out.*

That I am not getting a point for this doesn't matter to me

###*3. Don't look back*
##*Ever had that moment when you clicked enter two times just a bit too fast*

You are not allowed to repeat what you just did or at least see what you did wrong just a second before. Though it is nice that duolingo automatically decides what I should learn based on my mistakes and the words I unveil. Going back or at least having the data of mistakes in the last lessons accessible would be nice and a good way to learn and not make similar mistakes.

##What is your opinion on these suggestions? Or do you have other small suggestions for big improvements


Edit:
###*4. Still I see no changes*
##*After a fruitful discussion with other Duolingo users you are not allowed to report mistakes or additions in Duolingo.*
When you comment on something and finally see how it should be and want to correct it duo tells you to just redo the entire chapter to report it.

As a native Spanish speaker that has taken some of the Spanish lessons I can confirm that some phrases and words sound really awkward and even differ from how people say it on the day-to-day. I'm learning French and a lot of people complain about the same on that language's discussion posts

It is a fact that nobody *likes* the robotic voice. Or at least not more than an actual person speaking. So why not have a *native* speaker for each language to record the words and sentences used on the courses? That would mean to have a person to work on and improve the oral part. If having new employees in charge of that task is by no means an option for Duolingo, where people upload their recordings in a very clear and comprensible voice and a native speaker moderator simply listens and approves the correct ones. I'm more than sure that people from all around the world would be glad to contribute (I would). Thereby, instead (or additionaly) of the robotic voice, you could have a number of selected recordings from different persons (and why not regions) to listen to and compare aswell. Would something like this be viable?

* The user can at any time review the answer they gave to the previous question (or questions), Correct Answer: yxz"". Parts of the bar could also be red for those questions the user got wrong, so it would be easy to review all wrong answers at the end.

One possible remedy could be advanced speaking translations.  Duolingo could give an English(in my case) sentence and have users speak their Spanish translation into the microphone.  I know this would be a difficult addition to the current lesson structure and could potentially be very error prone.  Instead of being part of the lessons this type of format could be used as a standalone practice session in each section. The simple act of having to speak a sentence in Spanish that is not provided by Duolingo will help users actively remember vocabulary in a conversation.  Currently I find myself just reading the Spanish sentences out loud with little active thinking on my part.  

I do not have any studies to point to to back up my Idea, I guess I'll have to settle with it being good and using some other resources(such as Verbling) to supplement this deficiency.

1353740208.0,13peyl,Feedback on Duolingo,SquareWheel,14,3,23,"Hi there

I've been using Duolingo for about two weeks now.  Still really early for feedback perhaps

I learned of Duolingo when the iPhone app came out so that's what I've been using.  The app is incredibly polished

I realized I could do the lessons on the site earlier too and have done a couple lessons that way.  It's neat how it has voice recognition

Anyway

Not once has it explained when to use 'tu' vs 'vous'

I feel that a larger focus on teaching the rules of the language and not just letting you know when you're right or wrong would greatly enhance the program.  A friend explained that pronouns affect the suffixes of verbs

The only other issue I'd suggest is that the text-to-speech is too fast.  You can't tell where one word ends and the next word begins.  I don't think it's just due to my untrained ear either as the Google Translate tool speaks in a slower

At the moment is if you want to practice your vocabulary. you have two options

Timed practise - rewarded more highly but i often find myself running out of time pretty early on and maximum get to about 7-8 questions in

Non timed practise- easier option but if you lose all three hearts then you receive no reward for practising

In my opinion the practice mode could be better implemented -  where you are awarded a point when you get a wrong answer 

I suppose a bit more like the memrise appraoach

Obviously for the main lesson i still agree with the hearts system

Sorry if this doesnt make sense its late and im cant seem to put what i mean into words properly


TLDR ; non 'punishment' for failure on practice mode

EDIT : had a bit more of a think about it... so what im trying to say i see duolingo a bit like an RPG game

Practicing vocabulary is the equivalent of 

And i know for myself im not quite incentivised to practice my vocab if the same amount of time i could collect coins through skill tree lessons...

I that the practice in itself is useful whether i earn coins or not.. but its the rpg style coin gathering which keeps me coming back to duolingo for more and at the moment practice vocab doesnt really do this for me

[a screenshot of new translation pages](http://imgur.com/zWIqj)

Some feedback for the DuoLingo team. I like it because:

* 1. New elements give it more of a game/competitive feel
* 2. This layout makes your feel like you're working towards the completion of a document (giving the task a goal)
* 3. No more of those wonky sliding windows. I really saw no need for those.
* 4. Now you get to see the context of the text better
* 5. More prominent feedback sections

What I don't like:

* 1. You can't see for which section your earning points. Often I would only translate sentences that earn more than just 'skill points'. There's no indication on the new pages. This may be a good thing for Duolingo considering the old set up was rewarding a 'bad practice' of translating only for points. 
* 2. You can't edit immediately after making a translation. You must reload the page before you can edit again. Immediate editing helps

I signed up for duolingo because I have a lot of hope for this type of program and think it is quite unique and fascinating. I have been interested in learning French, go figure. 

Anyhow

* **1]** Do I need an invite

* **2]** When it says that ""## days are left until the dawn of a new era""


* **3]** For those who are already using it

I feel as though my understanding of English and Basic Latin principals will help me through the courses as French is a Latin based language

I really thank everyone for their future comments and hope to hear from you soon! Until then

A hungry mind is a luxury that many do not possess and having the determination to feed it is a power none can contain.

**T.L.;D.R.** Do I need an invite or confirmation email? What does ""dawn of a new era"" mean? How is the program going for you? Keep Learning!

Translate these sentences from your language to target language or the other way around:

She got in the car to go to the store.
She bought an apple and ate it.

These sentences would be different from the sentences used in the lessons at least enough so you aren't repeating a whole sentence you have memorized. You would need to make your own sentences. I'm not sure how long you could make these or would want to as there could be a lot of variety in correct responses and the program may have a hard time knowing all of the correct answers.

**Music Theory:**

Score reading, Solfege, Harmony and Counterpoint, Composition etc. etc.

**Instruments:**

A range of Instruments from Guitar, Harmonica, Ukulele (Pretty much any instrument that exists) So you have a tool which to use to teach yourself instruments in a similar way to how Duolingo teaches languages

**Sound Engineering:**

It could also offer basics and more advance lessons in sound mixing

So basically anything and everything to do with music and sound production.

When dealing with plural possessive pronouns, take the following sentence:
