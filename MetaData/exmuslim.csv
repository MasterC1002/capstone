1345057622.0,y9xur,To young women considering leaving Islam...,chordaetendineae,162,22,69,"Do it. As soon as you possibly can. There is nothing in this 'faith' for you. And believe me

I apologize in advance if this reads a little ""personal-teenage-diary"" or too whiny. I have a lot of emotions coursing through me right now

I'm a 24-year-old Canadian woman. My family moved to a suburb just outside Toronto from Pakistan when I was 13. I left home at 17 and have tried my best to never look back. I had some semblance of a relationship with my parents until last year because the constant fear of verbal and physical abuse got too much. They're currently about 90% cut off (I check in on them once every three or four months via phone call).

1. The followers of this faith will have you believe that you need correction at all times. I remember being 14 and beaten to an inch of my life by my father for cutting (a guidance counselor found out at school and told them) because I was dealing with profoundly low self-esteem... from being beaten and berated at home on a regular basis. It was a cycle I did not get out of til last year, and it'll fuck you up proper when there is conflict, and your parents are allowed to scream, hit and berate you... but you aren't allowed to cry, speak out or do anything about your own anger. Eventually you take it out on yourself, til you become entirely incapable of healthily working through your anger and sadness. It's taken me five years of intensive self-therapy to realize this. I've only now started to feel anger in ways I think are healthy-ish.  Islam will tell you that your parents and elders are all-knowing and deserve the utmost respect, but here's how real life works: you don't need to respect anyone who won't respect you.

2. Get help and support if you need it, dozens of which had fresh stitches. Somehow, broken bodies are more acceptable when you're a woman. This is fucked up. Someone who has the same beliefs that you were raised in is in no way better equipped to provide you with emotional support - if anything, they are worse. I remember my family complaining that I wouldn't open up, but doing that meant further physical and verbal abuse because my issues were with them in the first place. The muslim 'counselor' my family ended up with after my first suicide attempt (that's how much I learned to hate myself) was quick to tell me that maybe if I just ____ that I would give my parents less grief.

3. You and your body are valuable. This is the 'faith' that told me that my rapist 'should have married me"" when I was ten years old. I never told anyone or sought justice because at ten years old, but it is a struggle. It is a difficult struggle. This is the same religion that tells me to cover up my ankles/ass/etc in the interest of modesty. Guess what: men shouldn't be raping women. I'll dress based on how I want to dress, not based on the fear of a man 'inexplicably' raping me. No one 'asks' to be raped.

4. This one isn't fun: as long as you live under your parents' roof, because sometimes their desire to hear the 'truth' results in you getting fucked over by being vulnerable.

5. No one. No one. No one. Is allowed to touch you without your consent. You brother is NOT allowed to hit you. Your mother is NOT allowed to slap you for not washing the dishes. I don't care what anyone else says to you - you cannot put up with this physical abuse

6. Get a job, as mine did. Having a daughter who was working 2 part-time jobs at fourteen was a major source of shame for my parents, but I can guarantee you that I wouldn't be where I was had I not worked my ass off. I'm 24, haven't graduated from university yet but I'm in a mid-level position at a major hospital because I can speak to having 8 years of experience in my field. I took no money from my parents for school despite them offering. Not being allowed to learn or gain meaningful working experience outside of your kitchen, as would have been my family's desire, is one way to fuck yourself over. Remember, you want to be as solid and independent as you can be. Many muslim families keep their daughters from doing these things to keep them weak and dependent. You owe it to yourself to do better than that.

7. There's nothing wrong with masturbating. Do it as much as you want. Same with sexual experimentation. Your body is amazing and you deserve to feel good about it. Just don't get caught

8. The constant lying that you have to do with your parents to feel sane? It's necessary but it will catch up with you, the truth is valuable but I know that being able to keep up a good lie is essential to survival as a female in a muslim family.

9. One day you'll perhaps have daughters. I want you to think about how you would feel if someone treated your daughters the way your family treats you. If it doesn't equate

10. There are people who love you for being you. They may not be related to you by blood but that isn't necessary. My chosen family is made up of my little sister, give me support and honest advice when I ask for it, keep me company when I'm sad, and make me feel like a million bucks when I need it. This is what a family does. My parents tried quite hard to get me to choose between them and friends, i.e. ""fine, no one will take care of you and you'll get raped and die on the streets if you don't do as we say"". My 'chosen' family would never force me to choose between them and someone/something else. That's what unconditional love looks like.

1367388883.0,1dgugs,I snapped.,whereistheLID,149,21,96,"My parents never allowed me to wear jeans.

A few months ago, boot-cut jeans. They blended in with the rest of my black, gray, and navy bottoms in my closet, and you couldn't tell they were jeans material without getting a close look. I threw them in the wash every 2 weeks or so with the rest of my clothes, and no one was any the wiser. I thought I had gotten away with it.

Today, ""Mamma look, Aapi [big sister] has a pair of jeans!"" 

That is when the storm began.

I got home late as my last class ended at 8. I stepped into front door, and sister were waiting for me in the living room. My dad spoke first. 

""What pants are you wearing?""

""The ones I usually wear. These gray slacks. Why?""

My mom pulled out my jeans from the chair

Millions of excuses started running through my head: *They're my friend's*; *No

But I was tired

My dad exploded. He stood up,. ""Shaitan! Is this the kind of behavior you are learning at that college you go to?"" I said nothing - this kind of question merited no response. He continued. ""You are my oldest daughter and you are supposed to set an example for your sister. This is what you are teaching her? That she can wear whatever kinds of clothes are in fashion in America and walk around naked behind her parents' back?"" 

Now that needed a response. I calmly said

My dad didn't listen. ""Do you know who wears clothes like these?"" he went on. ""Prostitutes wear jeans. Women who have no shame and no respect for their religion and their society wear clothes like these.""

So I snapped. ""And how would you know that?"" I asked.

That's when he slapped me, on my back. My mom grabbed his hands and tried to stop him. He stopped and stood there panting. He threw the jeans at my mom and said, ""Go burn this. I don't want this in my sight."" She didn't leave. My sister had already ran to hide in her room.

Then he quietly said, everything you are learning in America goes entirely against the values I raised you with. I did not bring you here to become Americans. You are a Muslim woman and you should behave like a Muslim woman.""

I responded

He started raising his voice again. ""Jeans are clothes that are made for men. It is forbidden for women to wear men's clothes. I have already let you wear pants to school because it was required at school

""I don't want to wear a burkha. I have to walk really long distances to walk to my classes

""This heat is nothing! You will burn in hell for dressing immodestly.""

""Then let me burn in hell

""Astaghfirullah! You are a Muslim and you dare to say something like that?""

""Maybe I don't want to be a Muslim then!"" I shouted.

The storm renewed again. ""What did you say? Do you know what kind of gunah [sin] you committed right now?""

I said nothing.

""Read the shahadah now and take back what you said!""

I said nothing. He slapped me. ""Read it! Say it! Say the shahadah!"" 

I still said nothing.

""Shaitan! This is what America has made you into. This is it! You are no longer going to college. You will not go to classes tomorrow. You will sit at home and read the Quran and pray. I am taking you out of this shaitany institution tomorrow

I didn't argue. I left. My mom sat there sobbing.

I'm in my room right now, writing everything down while it's still fresh. I translated everything to the best of my ability from Urdu. Maybe I will submit this, maybe I won't.  The writing helps. I feel hyper aware of my surroundings, of my sister's slow breathing as she tries to sleep over the sound of my typing. I don't blame her for anything. My mom was just in here with my jeans. She told me to throw it away and didn't want to see me wearing it ever. I said nothing, took the jeans and hung them in my closet. I couldn't even iron them; I hate un-ironed clothes. She asked if I wanted the ice-pack. I said nothing. She walked out. I can hear her crying.

I've had worse. This was mild compared to prior events. But I have never come so close to voicing my true thoughts before. Too much rage. I should  be more careful next time. I'm not worried. Everything will blow over by next week and I'll return to school. 

Good thing I have no finals this week and I can afford to miss a few classes.

**UPDATE:** He came to wake me up this morning and told me to go to school, and don't forget to wear your burkha.""

Sure

Thank you everyone for your support and encouragement. I love the community this subreddit fosters. For your ease, but this kind of major explosion happens only once in a while so I know how to handle myself.

For those of you suggesting I call the police, and it will cause more harm than good in the long run. He has never lifted a hand against my younger sisters and tends to be more lenient with them; I don't know if this is because he is getting old and feeble or because they're still babies in his eyes. Either way, I'm glad. I simply wanted to vent a little, and posting to this subreddit helped  a lot. I received some good advice, the best of which seem to be to take control into your own hands. Getting slapped here and there isn't worth the trouble, I'm made of stronger stuff than that!

I would move out in a heartbeat if I could, my sisters and my mom need me. I stick around knowing that I can help my sisters grow up to be better people than my dad ever would. One of my sisters has already started spouting my dad's fundamental beliefs, and I see it as my responsibility to teach her to think logically and question everything. I can't do that if I'm not there. Maybe once they graduate high school, I'll have more freedom...

1373059117.0,1hpoqp,"My parents threw me out last night for being a ""slut"".",,132,18,92,"So to preface

Last night was 4th of July. I rarely EVER go out with friends

Getting out of downtown was a nightmare. There were THOUSANDS of people and traffic was ridiculously backed up. It would take literally 20 minutes to drive 1 block. So I got home around 12:45 am. 

When I was about 2 minutes away from my house my mother called me. I saw the call and rejected it because I was already almost home. As soon as I got in the door

She started yelling immediately asking me where I've been, etc. I just said ""I was downtown with my friends watching the fireworks and I went to Applebee's"". (I even had a box of leftover food to prove I was actually eating there).

My mother wasn't having it. She starts accusing me of being a slut and saying she KNOWS I was out doing ""bad things"" with boys. She's screaming at me and just shouting insults and I go upstairs and she follows me. 

She says I need to get the hell out of her house because she doesn't want a slut of a daughter. Apparently she called my dad earlier and he told her to lock me out of the house. So I grab some of my things (I had work in the morning) and start heading down the stairs. She's still yelling so I stop and say ""It's really none of your business what I was doing. I'm an adult

She says ""if you're in my house everything is my business""

and I just say ""Well I'm not going to be in your house anymore so you can go to hell""

and she punches me in my arm really hard. I just stand there and kinda look at her and she punches me twice more. On the third punch I grab her arm and say ""Do not hit me"" and let go of it and continue down the stairs.

 She acts like her arm is really hurt (it wasn't. I seriously barely touched it lol) and my sister comes running down the stairs and hits me on the back of the head really hard. I felt really dizzy all of the sudden and kinda sat down on the stairs and she hits me AGAIN on the head. My arm kinda jerks on the carpet and I have a huge mark of carpet burn on my arm. Ugh anyway

I just get up, accusing me of sleeping around (I don;t) and saying things like ""oh you just go to the gym so you can stand around in your bra in front of boys"" (I've never done that, actually).

So I drive around for a while before calling a friend. She's a 40 year old American convert. She tells me to come to her apartment. I was really hesitant because I know this woman struggles a lot and I didn't want to be a burden on her. She's being evicted from her home and lost her job and is about to be homeless. But she was insistent on taking me in anyway. 

So I drive over to her apartment and I park outside. At this point I'm pretty shaken up and I'm crying a lot. I didn't want to go inside because she has a young daughter who was probably sleeping and I didn't want to disturb her. Then I hear a knock on my window. The woman's husband, and tells me to open the door. 

He says to me ""No


And I just fucking lost it. My own dad told my mom to lock me out of the house and not let me back in

They had me sleep in their daughter's bedroom. I woke up this morning

My mother texted me today asking ""are you ok?"". No bitch, got my head beaten and got kicked out. I contacted the local police department and they will go with me to collect my things from the house, to ensure that she doesn't try to start anymore fights or prevent me from getting my things.

To all the young girls here don't no matter what you do ever agree to visit back home. This is how my mess started I was a happy 15 year old going to school, I had a great life. Then my dad suggested we all ,me my mom and male siblings, go to the ME to visit my grandparents for the summer. I was excited I didn't see them in a long time. We were suppose to stay two months, one week before we were supposed to go back my dad tells me your staying. I was shocked I tried to argue but he pushed and said no I don't like how you act in America you are going to live with your grandparents from now on. I was completely blind sided we never had a conversation about it but in hindsight he was a pretty absentee dad. When I protested again he took both my passports out of his pocket and lit them on fire. 

They left the next week. I refused to speak to them for a year. My grandparents were much stricter they kept on a tight curfew a bus picks me up to go to the all girls school in the morning and drops me off in the afternoon. If I want to go out with it has to be with my female cousins only and only to there house. They threw out all my clothes calling then to proactive and bought me all jilbabs and forced to wear the hijab. My grandad changed too he went from being a nice old man. To assuming the role of a over protective father if I would question him or my grandma I will get hit with a cane. The worst time was when they caught me watching a rap video on tv. He thought it was a porno before I could explain he hit me on the top of my head so hard it hurt when I put on the hijab for a week. 

I barley passed school because I didn't have a grasp on the language. Once I graduated they told me it was time to get married and that my cousin had asked to marry me. I was mortified he was in his 30s and I was 18 at the time and he was my cousin. I begged them not to do it

We got married and once again my life changed for the worse, and obsessive. He would inspect the house everyday to make sure it was spotless he stuck my face down on the tiles to show me I missed a spot. He threw food at me when it wasn't cooked to his liking. And would force himself on me every night, no exceptions. 

Then I got pregnant had a daughter

I hate my life. I hate my husband. I hate my parents. I hate god. If it wasn't for my kids I would have killed myself along time ago. Part of me wishes I did do it earlier.

My parents are well educated and they raised me with a strong emphasis on Islam. I learned to read the Quran like most young Muslims do. I went to tajweed classes


After moving to the West, but nonetheless we were not too fond of America either.


My parents bought me Islamic literature, mountains being pegs, the seven layers of the atmosphere, and the big bang. All of these amazing bits of ""science"" were in my holy book!


When I was about 12, I pulled out a book by Harun Yahya that I had been reading. I called out the teacher. I told him evolution was a lie and that he was making a mistake teaching it to us. I was a shy kid, but I was not going to sit back and let this man lie to my classmates. The poor teacher, I saw his face sink, he was going to say something, but he bit his tongue and turned the movie off. I had won. This was all the proof I needed to reaffirm what Harun Yahya had told me in his books - the scientists all knew evolution was 'just a theory' and all lies. The evil scientists just did not admit the lies they knew they were telling. I felt vindicated.


When I was 13, I thought there was no intercession on judgement day. But what my ami-jaan was saying was amazing enough to push the doubt to the back of my head.


At 14, that our faith was lacking. After all, the prophet was the best of men, and that we had to follow him exactly. Up till now, all that meant to me was maybe growing a beard when I was older, entering the washroom with my right foot, doing dawah


I was confused. My friend told me that his Islam was pure. It came directly from the source. Other sects were based on bida'a. Of course, but I'd never heard anyone (let alone a young teenager) say the entire world was in jahilliya. 


I was torn. As a Muslim, then I would have to become a true Muslim. Not a grocery store Muslim, picking and choosing what to follow.


I read


It sickened me.


This so-called real Islam was disgusting. The stories of Mohammad made my stomach churn. I had a Sahih Bukhari book in my house. It came with commentary. I read it. There were stories about taking sex slaves, but they didnt satisfy me.


It made me want to throw up. No. This could not be the real Islam. Islam was peace. Islam was submission to God. Islam was getting up early on Eid and watching my mother make kheer. Islam was long nights of taraweeh. Islam was samosas in Ramadan. Islam was science. Islam was a miracle.


I was 16. I couldnt handle it. I stopped reading. I stopped learning. I just focused on school for a bit.


I stumbled on a forum of liberal Muslims. They called themselves the Submitters, Tirmidhi, Muslim, Abu Dawood, Al-Nasai, Ibn Majah - all out the window. They the believed only in the Quran. I read about how the hadith were corrupt. Allah did not gaurentee their authenticity. I read some more. The hadith were lies, the Quran was the only truth. Without the hadith, to the Rashidun Khalifas. After all


I was happy! I was excited. I started reading about Islam again


It did not last long. I was at the masjid


I knew bullshit when I heard it. I went home and and asked on the forum. Their answer was the same. I did not buy it. I read some older English translations. Beating was allowed. I remembered what my friend had told me before. My Islam was a ""pussified


Growing up, so I did nothing.


A few months later


Everything I knew. My entire faith. My community. It was built on a lie told centuries ago.


Its been five years now. I'm happy. I'm about to graduate from university. I've come to accept the way the world is. I majored in evolutionary biology. (Syed Qutb must be turning in his grave.)My parents do not know anything

You are not weak.  And you are not wrong.  There is nothing wrong with you.  You have tried

And you are not alone.  Do not be driven away by the vitriol that occasionally arises on this subreddit.  From those who will talk about their experience with a Muslim and call that person a bitch or a bastard, or call them stupid.  These people are not all of us.  They are bitter, and understandably so.  See they, like you, most likely, have gone through this exact same process.  Their families and friends have turned against them in face of their doubts.  They have been hurt.  They watch their mothers cry and feel iti is their fault.  Their mothers tell them it is.  They have become bitter.  And that is understandable.
But I do not hate you.  I do not think you are stupid.  I do not think you are a bitch or a bastard.  I would not refuse to shake your hand if I knew your beliefs and I would not turn away from you if you needed help.  What I believe is that you are a victim.  Like I was.  Like we all were.  You probably don’t agree.  You see it a different way.  Maybe you always will.  And that’s ok.  But maybe in time you will come to see things the way I do.  

I make no effort to conceal my true efforts.  I dislike Islam.  I would love to see it, and rationality, and long insomniatic nights spent questioning the nature of life, and by not squelching those doubts in a futile attempt to restore faith in something you know deep down is not true.  Yes, that’s what I would love to see in this world.  I would love to recruit every one of you to join my side because I believe it would make this world a better place.  But it is not out of this desire that I extend my hand to you.  It is out of my love for my fellow human being.  Because I know one of you, somewhere, is experiencing the same pain I felt for so many years.  And I want you to know you are not alone.  In your darkest hour, even if you were a perfect stranger to them.  I am one such person.  I am here for you.  Any day or any time.  If you need to talk to someone who understands.  Send me a message.  Or don’t.  Hate me if you want.  Hate me for everything its worth in recognizing what I am: an apostate from your religion, then I’ll have felt every ounce of pain I’ve taken in along the way was worth it.  ",t5_2s7k2

We are friends of the groom's family. The wedding (contract signing ceremony) was held at the bride's house. The house is divided by a wall between the living room and the dining room. The women sat in the living room

The bride comes out looking gorgeous and really excited. She was so sweet and seemed to be really happy that she was getting married. Well

The Sheikh/men decided to put up room dividers between the living room and the dining room

So the bride's sister crossed over and argued with the men but the sheikh kept yelling at her to get back into the women's section. Note

So all the women didn't get to see the contract ceremony, but I don't know the bride's family, and I was in their house and since they didn't say anything I didn't want to cause trouble. 

So I gave up a weekend to go to a wedding that I didn't even get to see because I'm a girl. And the bride didn't get to be part of her own wedding because she's a girl.

1. In a universe infinitely big, we are supposed to be the folks created in the Heavens. We are so important that we piss God off so much that he'll burn us for eternity if we don't pray five times a day. What makes this worse? God saying that it's for our own good to pray, not because that it gives him anything. Why would I go to hell if I didn't pray, and what's so bad with having sex before marriage? Societies have been doing so and it hasn't been all bad.

2. The ""test"" of God. God is all-knowing. He knows about me, how I would act in any situation at any given time. He knows that I strongly rely on the factual side of reality, since that it's the only thing that has worked really well for us humans, and He knows that if I find absurdities and contradictions in the Qur'an, I'll stop believing. He knows I'm for gay rights, equality of genders and freedom of religion. He knows it makes me sad to know that I can't eat food from my best friend, who is an Atheist. Such practices are viewed as injust and immoral for me and I can't advocate any ideology that would justify them. God made me that way. Why would he want to test me then? Test run or something? He knows me and he needs not to test me, but if God knows which I'll choose

3. God's way of dealing with humanity: he has been sending prophets since the beginning of time up until Muhammad, yes, he does want it to be this way, than the other way around. It's a ridiculous, unfair test where many are favourised ahead of others. If you're born as anything non-Muslim, sucks for you.

4. The hate against other religions in Islam: Surat al-Fatihah, the Jews and the Christians. The Jizya tax, which could pretty much be viewed as a form of discrimination, the countless verses that promote hate against Ahl al-Kitab, mentioning how misguided and misfortunate they are, the ""we against the world"" mentality all Muslims have, which is why you see a lot of Muslims ""hate"" the West and the Europeans are all examples of how Islam opposes other spiritual ideologies. Everyone is against Muslims, they believe that

5. The justification of killing, compared to those of the US, where the punishment system is much harsher. We've had criminology in school and we saw statistics that left no doubt that harsh punishments are almost always counterproductive.

6. The absurdities in the Qur'an and Hadith - God turned Jews into pigs, the Sun runs its course and then sets under Allah's throne, Eve was made of Adam's womb, Humans were created in ""ahsan taquim"", the most perfect form, the Devil farts not to hear the Athan, the Devil pisses in my ear if I don't wake up for al-Fajr prayer, the palace of Suleyman

7. Inequality between men and women; men are superior to women, women are forced to cover up as if sexual attraction is one way, not both ways (men are attracted by women, but never the other way around), womens inability to pray and fast due to period, as if God, who has created you in his image, etc.

8. The illogical practice of circumision - why would we chop off what God gave us? We were made in ""ahsan taquim"". Same goes for covering up while you e.g pray. God made you and I'd assume he should accept his creation just the way they are.

9. The fact that the Qur'an borrowed so much from ancient Greek science and indulged it as proof of God

10. Islam speaking so highly of itself, that it is the best remedy for humanity, when reality speaks differently on that matter. Millions have been oppressed and got their lives ruined because of Islam. How perfect is something when it could be ""misinterepted"" so easily?

11. Arguments and questions that I could not find any way around when I was a Muslim:
- We say the universe can't create itself
- Muslims believe that most people are going to Hell. Let's assume that 6/10 are hellbound. We know babies whom are murdered go instantly to heaven (which is not justice). With that in mind, I'll save 60% of those from going to Hell. On one hand, I'm being a ruthless murderer, and on the other, I'm an eternal hero. Which am I, according to Islam?
- Why does God lead whom he will to astray? Wasn't that Shaytan's work? Why has he sealed the hearing and sight of many people so that they can't accept Islam? Surely has he led me to astray

12. Islam is a production of its time and age. It's everything you'd expect from the Arabs of the 5th century - Jinn, ban of *all* alcohol consumption (if you drink a little red wine, you'll get resveratol which is good for your heart), no pig eating (pigs cause troubles if not well-cooked. Otherwise, they're not dangerous), thinking with your heart, flat earth, electricity, and it is therefore quickly outdated. There isn't anything that specifies Muslims living near the poles

13. Muslims themselves. Islam may sound all good in practice (which it doesn't, no matter how hard I try to justify it. God just sounds like a mean tyrant who creates some so that they go to hell. Look at the Muslim countries, they're miles behind everyone else in everything, and they can't even live up to their own religion.

14. EDT: The concept of eternal torment. Let's assume that life on earth is 120 years at its longest. If I'm very lucky, this is a very long time by earthly measures, and a lot of good/bad deeds can be collected under this time. Let's assume that I spend these 120 years spreading misery and agony on earth, that I even die trying to molest a child. I'll go down in history as the cruelest man ever lived and everyone would wish me hellfire. Now, remember that hell isn't a time-subjected punishment and it can carry on and on to no end. Picture that. What's 120 years compared to an eternity? Absolutely nothing. How could someone be punished for eternity for doing something that is finite? No crime in existence would justify burning in the most harsh and graphic way to no end.

15. And finally, important and perfect as God ought it would be, people cry ""that is a metaphor!"". There is absolutely no evidence of Adam and Eve, yet so many will believe that everything in this world evolved, except for us humans, forgetting  how our DNA is 99% similar to the apes'. The same logic applies to many absurdities that are taken as literal fact until proven absurd, which is when scholars declare these doctrines to be metaphorical work of beauty (!!) to save face.",False,editorial,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1jvnyo/why_i_as_a_muslim_sold_myself_and_left_islam/

I never knew I could be that happy.

It's an essay

If you’re finding it difficult, plan your next moves and take it really slowly, or as slow as you need. It helps to have a group of people you can trust outside of the Muslim community. Just remember that it isn’t shameful what you’re doing. It’s your life and your life is going to end. It’s not going to be the people around you who will enjoy it or waste it. It’ll be you. You have no idea how much better it will feel to just take it off and remove the shackles you have to this religion.


A few of you who are familiar with me know I first began wearing the headscarf when I was around about five years old because, along with being the smartest or the fastest and so on. This did not change much as I got older. My mother started wearing it when she was in her thirties and I essentially mimicked her because at the time I was still a kid who thought the sun shone out of her arse.  My sister started wearing it then as well and took it off pretty soon after. As I initially wore it when I was five, it became a part of my identity and I never once desired its removal. That is until I registered I no longer believed in the Muslim God.



Initially in late January 2012, but people would ask me about “my religion” a lot. I hadn’t noticed it before but what I appeared to be to strangers was a large factor to how they treated me. I just didn’t know any different (I later asked my closer friends about what it was like initially meeting me and they all mentioned feeling “weary” due to the headscarf – considering I live in a Western country where there weren’t a lot of head-scarf Muslims around, they were unsure as to how “normal” I was).



I didn’t think I was able to do it. At first, my hair was something which became special to me as I got older. It was something that was entirely mine to show and something only I could choose or control – it was extraordinarily important to me simply because it was mine.



My first real attempt to take it off was right after Ramadan. The catalyser to this was that I realized that the longer that I “represented Islam” meant the longer I had to appear to follow its rules and represent it as well as I always had. It felt wrong to represent this religion in any other way. Ramadan was filled with non Muslims asking me about Ramadan or Muslims asking me how my fasting was going and I couldn’t stand feeling as though I was a liar. This was when I started taking leaps to make it come off. I brought the subject up with my parents. My father as always wasn’t encouraging but accepting. My mother in contrast told me she’d rather die than face that kind of gossip. For the record



I still attempted to go forward with “the plan” to take it off. I gave myself two weeks to take it off and I didn’t really succeed. I hadn’t factored in the panic attacks or much of anything in particular



The first step was picking a close guy friend I could trust and test out the waters (I knew him since high school and he was quite familiar with my “spiritual journey”



I went to visit my sister (who is remarkably both accepting and encouraging of my apostasy despite being a 'Muslim') on the other side of the country. My first experience with it off was going from the rural area into the city (aside from a run the evening prior, went on that two hour train ride and finally reached the city. The first thing I noticed was at first I didn’t feel much different. Somewhere between the space of deciding to take it off, realistically deciding to take it off and actually taking it off, I stopped feeling the panic attacks. I guess it was because I’d already completed the first two steps and the planning must’ve really kicked in, or maybe I just stopped caring so much, or maybe it was because I knew no one else would see me and I could finally be myself. I walked around for around about four hours, taking photos as I went and behaving like a general tourist. There’s no real way to describe how it feels to take it off. I guess I felt really normal for once- and I hadn’t realized I felt different to everyone else before. It’s kind of like waking up one morning and discovering you were different when you didn’t need to be- as if you previously were some sort of pariah in society



Taking it off was freeing. Completely liberating. Just feeling the sun or wind whipping through my head and neck felt amazing. I noticed strangers treated me a little differently than I remembered








The whole experience taught me that the headscarf  doesn’t promote respect for a woman’s modesty or protection from male gaze but rather segregates women to a isolated position in society, what I’m saying is they aren’t given a choice not to and they have reduced ability to express themselves in colour or wear jewellery. Essentially, women like to feel beautiful on the outside and Islam I feel removes that freedom to be beautiful which underpins her inner confidence, perpetually placing her in a submissive role. Women, I believe, follow Islam more closely than men in from a younger age in most cases due to wearing the headscarf earlier and so are reminded of this position in society on a daily basis. Meanwhile men can get away with doing anything they want because the consequences for them are minimal and purely spiritual, whereas for women in Islam the consequences of inappropriate behaviour can compromise not just her reputation but the reputation of an entire religion. It seems hardly fair to me



Hope I brought some light into this issue.
If anyone has any questions




--I’ve since put it back on mostly for show in this tight knit community. I currently am facing a mother who cries all the time and keeps thrusting a turba in my hand round prayer times. And I indulge her because I can’t stand seeing her cry.  It feels weird praying since I stopped a while ago





I recently spent a day with a bunch of Arab women who wear headscarves at a beach. One of them remarked to me that what she missed the most about not wearing a headscarf was being able to go into the ocean. And it took all of me not to tell her that life didn’t have to be that way. That Islam was not the one true path. The poor girl isn’t that intelligent and I doubt she’ll ever come to this conclusion. She’s also recently married to a highly religious man so there’s nothing I can do. What we can take from this is a confirmation of my conclusion above.




Hoping you are well

This post is vague in order to protect the people involved in this situation.  The [original thread that this thread is providing an update to](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/10tvkf?sort=old) can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/10tvkf?sort=old).)

Day 1: To summarize the [original thread that this thread is providing an update to](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/10tvkf?sort=old)

Day 2: I had her stay at my house for a few days while my own family was out of town.  The very next day after I created the [original thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/10tvkf?sort=old)

I then got her added on as the second authorized user on the account for one of my credit cards.  With this arrangement, once her card arrives, she'll be able to charge anything she might need to my account and not worry about it until she's able to get solid financial footing of her own.  My family has no idea that I have this credit card (I have everything related to it sent to my PO Box), so I'm not worried about anyone finding out about this.

The next thing I did that day was purchase a no contract

Day 3: The next day, they let police know that they wanted nothing to do with their daughter and that she was free to take her things out of the house within the next three days.  This could not take place without a police officer present, so she was told that a police officer would be available to accompany her (and me) to her parents' house to take her belongings out of the house the following day.  She was terrified of even doing this, but I told her that it simply had to be done and that I would be there (in addition to a police officer) so she wouldn't have to worry about her safety.

Day 4: She and I waited down the street from her parents' house until we saw the police officer's car pull up to her parents' house.  The police officer knocked on the door and her mother opened it.  The police officer then came over to us and told us that her mother had said that her daughter could only take her belongings out of her bedroom and no other room in the house.  The police officer had also made sure that nobody else was in the house but her mother and asked if she was okay with her mother being in the house while we moved her stuff out.  She said it was fine and didn't fight her mother on her limiting her daughter to only taking things out of her bedroom

On our many trips up and down the stairs of her house, ""I hope you're happy that you're turning down a marriage to sleep with your new boyfriend [me],"" making it clear that her parents had already made the gigantic leap that she and I were in some sort of romantic relationship (I've noticed over the years that within Muslim-majority countries, this is almost always the cultural assumption).  Her mother also made several remarks towards me, including, ""We [she and her husband] always thought of you as a good son and what we'd want our son to be like if we had one.  We never would have expected anything like this from you.  You're a disgrace to your parents.""

Within 20 minutes

I was planning to try and look for a safe place for her to live on this day, so she had an emotional breakdown.  I stayed with her the whole day and helped calm her down and talk her through the situation, letting her know that she hadn't done anything wrong in this situation and that it was her parents who had forced her to take these actions.  Eventually, very late at night, she finally fell asleep.

Day 5: My family was set to come back home the next day, he said that she could stay there indefinitely and that he'd work with us if any months where paying rent was difficult came up.  We thanked him profusely and then moved her belongings into her new house.

Day 6: My family arrived home and had apparently received a call on their cell phone while away from her parents about what had transpired.  My family chastised me for getting involved in another family's affairs and especially when it came to their daughter (told you, ""Messing with his *ghirat*[""jealous pride""],"" but I made it clear that I wasn't going to back off and that I would not be telling them anything else about this situation.  They tried to argue with me a bit more (and even hinted that even *they* thought there must some romantic relationship between the two of us), but I wasn't backing off of my position and so they eventually dropped it.  Nobody in my family has spoken to me since.

After that confrontation with my family

While at her house, we decided that completing two years of community college online before having her transfer to a four-year university would be a better idea; besides, it's also a cheaper option.

Day 7: I spoke to my boss and she said that given the circumstances

That's pretty much it so far.  Coming up in the near future will be the courtroom hearing to finalize the restraining order and the fallout from the local Muslim community and my family.  As I said, who knows what will happen this Friday.

The whole situation has been difficult for many reasons, she doesn't wear her hijab outside every day (only when she feels like doing so) and dresses in common, American clothing, but she always makes sure to wear long sleeves and skirts/dresses.  She's never really had a habit of talking to guys other than me since her family and mine have known each other for so long, but she's almost never been around me alone until this situation occurred and has always made sure at least one other person was around whenever she and I were around each other for any purpose.  At this point, however, she's recognized that the circumstances call for these measures

(TLDR; I turned 18

Thank you guys for all your advice and support with my plan to get out of my house and leave my family to start my own life.
Things did not go as expected. I started early in the morning, I had The Discussion with my mom.

I expected her to yell and protest and call names, she just said ""no, you live here."" It was like she couldn't fathom the idea that I could do anything without her permission. We discussed religion for a while, and she still refused to even acknowledge the possibility that I could be able to leave on my own. She accused me of being a sex addict, leaving Islam just so I could be without sin. She accused me of prostituting myself to get the money to leave. She blamed the devil, the Western world, my dead father's genes

When she told me I couldn't leave, he said he'd be there in half an hour.

At Maghrib time, the phone rang, my signal he was there. I told my mom I was going to the bathroom, and walked away. I left from the front door quietly, got in his car, and he drove.

I haven't seen any family members since I left. My mom sent me an email recently telling me that she feels like I killed her. She's told the whole extended family what happened, and I'm working and going to college. I feel free now.

So yeah


TLDR; Broke the news, I escaped, living in hiding, things will be okay.

Thank you, ex-muslim.",soundfurious,89,25, she's been very accommodating and we managed to make a deal to make sure I can be self-sufficient enough before my contract ends.

If I had to give advice for anyone who is going through what I went through: keep your head up and learn to be independent. Make sure to have a strong social support system. Someone you can feel confident enough to share your thoughts and be willing to listen. I honestly am grateful to that friend who generously offered me a temporary place to stay when I had no where to go and until I got back on my feet. And for her words of encouragement and keeping me on track when I wasn't clearly thinking and wanted to quit it all and return back there to hug my mother. You will be frustrated, it will be lonely, scary and frightening because heck, you're in this big world and there are many dangers out there. But you have to leave when the danger is within your home. Home is supposed to be a safe place where you can feel free to express who you are. Home should not be a place where you can't be who you are.

I'm moving on with my life. I am much happier than I was living in my previous conditions. The first month was rough but I made it through.

I'm not sure if I should make a separate post on things I've learned in the process. Would anyone be interested in that?

**10 Signs You're a Libtard (and should shoot yourself in the face):**


10. You refer to Islam as a 'race'.

9. You refer any kind of criticism against Islam as 'racism' or 'bigotry' or 'Islamophobia'. Ironically

8. You are more sympathetic towards the Imams and Muslims who would rather spit on your human rights than the atheists and liberals and humanists who are fighting for your human rights.

7. You think Islam is a religion of 'peace'

6. You turn a blind eye when Muslims commit atrocities and practice   barbaric customs in the name of their religion

5. You have a secret desire to convert to Islam, or engage in any Islamic practice, '*because it's the cool and edgy Lefty thing to do, and I get to stick it to those Far-Rights!*'

4. You're willing to do a full dissertation on why Christianity is the most evilest, why the Church and the Pope are evil incarnate, and why the western world should eradicate Christianity from the face of the Earth with extreme prejudice, but as soon as somebody mentions Islam, suddenly you're all ""HEY LETS NOT GENERALIZE"" or ""BUT NOT ALL MUSLIMS ARE TERRORISTS"".

3. You think that having a drinking buddy named Hameed who works at Accounting two floors up makes you an expert on how real Islamic societies actually work.

2. When somebody mocks Islam, or does anything that blasphemes against Islam, you're actually angrier than the muslims themselves.

The title of this post is something most of us have had thrown at us. Normally I roll my eyes and just go back to googling [Batman](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOg3ZE3hNQc). However I thought

Sunni, Khajarite, Sufism, Quranism,etc. Different sects with differing interpretations of Islam. Followers of the different sects need not recognise the others as being Muslims. I am being diplomatic here, ***they can and do kill each other over this***. I guess those who act like this subscribe to the notion - might makes right. A concept organised religion is familiar with.

*Let's move on...*

____________________________
In my experience, etc. a kaafir. I have heard the terms bad Muslim and weak Muslim thrown around instead.

I have heard Muslims say that Bin Laden wasn't following Islam or was misguided. While some would outright declare him as not being a Muslim

Let's take a look at a few scenarios (excluding the previously mentioned sect issue) from the viewpoint of your average Muslim (*not theologians or Islamic scholars*):

* Convert (say a Westerner) who can't understand or read Arabic, doesn't wear the hijab or any form of Muslim garb, hasn't learned all the basics or read most of the Quran and hadith,etc. Believes in Allah, etc.

**Muslim.**

* Person born into a Muslim family. Drinks, etc.

**Muslim.**

* Person born into a Muslim family. Has occasional doubts about Allah and Islam. But still believes in Allah

**Muslim.**

* Person born into a Muslim family. Prays 5 times a day. Goes for Friday prayers. Read the Quran. Fasts during Ramadan. Believes in Allah

**Muslim.**

* Person born into a Muslim family. Prayed 5 times a day. Went for Friday prayers. Read the Quran. Fasted during Ramadan. Believed in Allah

**Never Muslim.**


Makes total sense!
_________________________________
The Quran mentions punishment in the after-life for apostasy. In the real world

So according to most Muslims

**A. We are attention whores?**

*Especially the ones still living in the closet.*

**B. We are young rebellious kids?**

*Especially those of us who are college graduates and those married with kids.*

**C. We are bigots who don't like Muslims?** 

*Especially those whose family and friends are Muslims and those married to Muslims.*

**D. We want to drink

*Especially those who still don't do any of these things that some ''weak/bad'' Muslims can get away with anyway.*

**E.We enjoy the risk of being ostracised

*Especially those in prison. (Sorry


__________________________________________

If you left Islam (for reasons other than those mentioned above)

Some Muslims specify that as long as you don't speak out against Islam - you don't deserve punishment in real life. 

So in summation this is what I think most Muslims say:

**If you claim you are an ''exmuslim''

Thanks for reading. Sorry for the mess. It's hard getting back into the mind of a theist.

*Sorry that I didn't include stuff like being corrupted by Satan/the West/Jews. It's impossible to cover all the excuses. Hopefully these cover the more common ones held by the average Muslim.*

Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects at hand.

When

But a miniature camel


:  
With a little old driver

I knew in a moment it must be Mohammed.

More rapid than eagles his coursers they came

And he whistled


:  
""Now Umar! now

On, on Abu Bakr and Furqan!

To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!

Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!""


:  
As dry sand that before the dust storm does fly

When they meet with an obstacle

So up to the house-top the coursers they flew

With the sleigh full of weapons


:  
And then

The prancing and pawing of each little foot.

As I drew in my head

Down the chimney Mohammed came with a bound.


:  
He was dressed all in a thob

And his clothes were all tarnished with infidel blood and soot.

A bundle of swords he had flung on his back

And he looked like a peddler


:  
His eyes-how they twinkled! his turban how merry!

His hands were like roses

His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow

And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.


:  
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth

And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.

He had a broad face and a little round belly

That shook when he laughed


:  
He was chubby and plump

And I laughed when I saw him

A wink of his eye and a twist of his head

Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.


:  
He spoke not a word

And filled all the stockings

And laying his finger inside of his nose

And giving a nod


:  
He sprang to his camel

And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.

But I heard him exclaim

""Eid Mubarak to all

I began to question god and religion when I was 11 years old (the year I started wearing hijab). I would stay up all night crying and reading the Quran trying to figure out what's right and what's wrong. I mentioned the problem once hypothetically to my mother and she said it was just a test from god and that satan is trying to lead me astray. So I forbade those thoughts and continued on with my life. I decided it that it doesn't matter if there is a god or not I'll just be the best person I can be and be obedient to make my family happy. 

And so I did. 

I began living the most elaborate lie
I was always at the mosque volunteering and had so many islamic/ quran classes (which I excelled at) that they took all weekend. After having a bad experience questioning something to my parents I never did it again. 

""Don't do this or this or this

""ok I won't""

THE END

How did I deal with it? Well TV wasn't allowed and internet access had to be with the screen in front of them (until college) so I had books. I literally lived through them. Sometimes I felt like I wasn't real, and well educated that I will change their mind!

I dealt with it because I believed I had no choice. Chance made me born into a Muslim family and so I must deal with it. Make the best of the situation and it will all be well. Besides

But about three years ago I starting ""daydreaming"" about leaving. I knew I can never tell them so I thought of just disappearing. ( I even thought of ways where I can just fake my own death, I was so close to leaving but I couldn't last minute. I chickened out and decided I would be okay to just keep pretending and maybe slowly drift away from the religion. Eventually it will die out with the on coming generation. 
But I couldn't pretend anymore. Yes

I'm ready to leave. I have some ideas and some plans and starting to save up money.

But how should I do it? And am I doing the right thing?

Thank you all for reading my life story. I know it's a bit all over the place but It felt so good to get it out (my hands are shaking)

But then I started faintly hearing a woman's voice through my headset
So I pressed pause and took my headset off, she was actually preaching and guess what she was preaching?  
Bingo
I listened to what she had to say to the commuters and I figured she wasn't really sure herself what she was talking about. For one moment, Islam is a religion of forgiveness, just turn to Allah! Then she started talking about the end of the world, and the signs that Muhammad gave us of its nearing. Some other random ahadith were spouted out of her mouth and also that they (the commuters) will be turned into pigs and monkeys like the ancient Jews.  

So after not being interested anymore I put my music back on and continued reading my trusty newspaper. When it was finally my stop
As she was right behind me and next to the door
And that's when I had enough as my eardrum was about to explode
Then that noisy bitch finally shut her trap. And those around us starting clapping their hands. I then put my headset back on and walked out in the coolest way possible.

So after procrastinating about this for almost a month
So I stood there

I was standing a few meters in front of my mother facing the clock on the wall and at about 8:15 I heard one of the verse that at its end said “For the believers, hell”. And that’s when I got irritated at the arrogance of that prick reciting and started talking.  

Me: “I have something to say.”  
-Mom: “Yes? :)”  
*I turn around to my dad and he’s looking at me
Me: “You always say that there should be communication
-Mom: “Yes
Me: “So now I have something to communicate. I don’t believe in Islam anymore.”
-Mom: “Wha- what?”  
-Dad: “What?”  
Me: “I don’t believe in Islam anymore
*dad stays silent

Alright so I’m skipping over this part
room. And dad had no reaction

Now my mother and I are sitting on her bed talking. I tell her I’m no longer a Muslim, I tell her because there’s too much fantasy in it, and I would rather believe in proof and facts. Naturally she asks me for what kind of proofs and says that we have proof all around us for Islam. Then I try to explain to her that I don’t believe it’s true just because it says it’s true, I tried to soften the blow by explaining deism (even though I’m not a deist, I’m so sick of lying), that I believe in a creator but not in religion. But she still has trouble understanding that concept, to her it’s either atheism or theism. At a certain point she said to me: “Are you accusing the prophet Muhammad pbuh of being a liar?”  


 That’s when I started a little to despair, the brightest and would never do bad stuff. Again, tried to explain that I haven’t change and I’m certainly not going to start robbing banks now, but I’m pretty sure she’ll forget it by tomorrow, if she hasn’t already.  
We finally came to the conclusion that she would try to bring me back with “proof” and “arguments” that “I have to accept if they are the truth”

A lot more has happened of course, damn this fucking religion, fucking shit I’m too young to be dealing with this crap and my parents not being able to imagine me not being a Muslim.

So here's my little story: 
A couple of months ago

Some of the catalysts for the change:
I live in South Africa. A very multicultural place. I could not accept that friends of mine who are better people than I am could go to a worse place because of their beliefs.
I was raised a muslim. I could not accept that I am so fortunate to be born into the 'right' religion.

My plans?
Well I have not come out to any family member. And I doubt I ever will voluntarily. However something like marriage will definitely bring it out in the open. Marrying a non-muslim would make it very obvious

Thankfully I am completing my degree soon and will need to move cities for my profession

I love my family though and I really wish I could blindly believe just to keep things easier for them. Unfortunately with the information age we are in

My entire life my parents held me back because I was a girl. I had to quit swimming in middle school because ""girls should not have people looking at them in wet tight clothes! haraam! allah will burn every part of your body you show!"" . I was basically under house arrest all the time because my parents didn't want me hanging out with groups of friends that included boys

 When it came time to apply to college, including the top university in my state. 

But my parents refused to let me go. I was a year ahead in school so I was only going to be 17 my first year of college and was still a minor who had to listen to my parents. We fought over it, or power, and had to go to the university I didn't want to go to.

Now I'm 20. I've gotten a job, pay my own rent and bills, have a car, etc. Things are OK for me, except the university I go to is awful. 

First, I get paid less at work than students from other universities because their schools are ranked higher than mine. Which means I come to work, do the same exact work, but get paid less because I go to a shitty school.

I was upset yesterday

Today she calls me saying she's 'very upset' because I don't give her credit. She says that I should thank her and god because thanks to them I am successful. Then she said 'And besides, didn't I?  I let you work for that company, didn't I?"" 

I flipped out. I was so angry. 

I said 'BECAUSE OF YOU? No, and I'm not going to thank god, for the hard work I did to get away from being oppressed and beaten over religion"" 

She was angry and kept saying ""well you're not grateful

In any other situation,he sits in the front seat and I sit in the back seat because I'm a female. 

 I can't forget my mom calling me a non-virgin slut for using tampons

I can't forget how hard I worked to get into a good university only to be forced to go to a shitty one because ""girls don't leave the home""

And now my mother wants to take credit for all of my hard work and say ""see? you're successful because of us! Thank Islam for where you are!""

Now if you are living in a house where you are being physically abused ignore this and just carry on with your plan. 

Now all of the posts I have seen so far are about young early to mid 20 somethings who just graduated UNI or are still attending in some form or another. Also what is common is the whole ""lifestyle"" argument being used to justify why you are planning on escaping. As an ex-moose who is still in the closet

First, eating out (everyone always says I won't, but you will at least once a week), utilities and other bills, some sort of transportation cost, and so on. Also don't forget the move itself will cost you a pretty penny. My move alone cost me 200 bucks just to move! (gas for my car, money for a friend who helped me move, and money on supplies for that first month!)

Finally a lot of you are trying to not only leave your parents, but unless your parents literally beat the snot out of you and torture and neglect you then leaving on negative terms is just foolsih! 

I moved out a month ago on excellent terms with my mom, it is easier to not tell her and let her enjoy her life. (now let the why should we have to hide our truth from them brigade begin. To you I say go ahead and be as honest as you want if you so desire, for me it is better to let people live in ignorance sometimes because it is just easier on everyone!) 

Anyway back to my point

So for all you ex-mooses so eager to leave home in a fit of rage keep these things in mind.

Have a stable job

Have a nice amount of money saved

After joining a group in support of [Waleed Hasayin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walid_Husayin) I started reading the blog of a fellow member of the group.  To my horror he himself was in a terrible situation in his country.  His atheism had become publically known, but the teachers as well.  He was forced to drop out of school, and only his mother's begging stopped his father from beating him too severely.  The situation became worse as he began to receive credible death threats from people who knew in which general area he lived.  He was terrified that he would be killed. 

Eventually he was forced to go into hiding.  This is where I could help. When a person goes into hiding it becomes exceedingly difficult to financially support oneself.  Not only this

It is very tough for people in this situation to get a travel visa, these exmuslims might not have access to the proper documentation to apply, even if they would be approved.  

After a few months the application for asylum went through and this exmuslim was able to leave the country.  It's still a rough place to be in, or have a job until his case for asylum is reviewed and he is granted it.  Luckily he documented the threats against him well even recording phone calls threatening his life, so his case is very strong and he is expected to be granted it.  This individual also happened to be an active blogger among secularists living in muslim majority countries, and through his connections I was also able to help out another few exmuslims in equally terrifying situations with funds to stay in hiding and plane tickets once their escape had been planned.

From my point of view I could not have gotten more value for my dollar, hands down, the best use I've found for my money.

Anyway this is just a basic overview of my experiences and I'd be happy to answer any questions anyone might have about this or fill in details if anyone is interested in any aspect of it.

Also for clarification

EDIT: I also forgot to mention that after the first exmuslim I helped went into hiding, these individuals are completely unable to seek protection with their government, who would sooner prosecute them even if they haven't insulted Islam.  Since they are no longer muslim there is a mistrust against them, and any individual can simply claim they insulted Islam and there is a very low bar for what can be considered insulting to Islam.",,False,self,1343858442.0,t3_xiktm

Like a good Muslim girl, but I'd agreed after 1 meeting, now I'm stuck.  Spent most of the marriage hounding this kind and funny man to become a better Muslim, to pray, banned alcohol from crossing our doorstep (he drank his beer on the stoop :) ).  

Our kid is born, your good deeds weighed against your bad and I'm certain his good deeds (though a good person, not a good muslim) would not outweigh the bad.  

Was personally never terrified of the afterlife, I watch as they carry him away in the coffin, and I say quietly ""that's it"" but someone overhears and tells me ""No, that's not it...""  and tells me all the ways that I could help his chances in the afterlife (something I hadn't even considered).  

So I throw myself into it, saying its for him.  I raise my kid to say prayers for him (was told her prayers would have special power).  Scrubbing the dirty floors of the masjid bathroom, I still wasn't certain of his chances - I couldn't see the correlation between me cleaning the masjid and his character.  

I was a full blown lunatic for a while - lost all connection to my rational side.  When I was losing a bit of my conviction, that we could be a family again.  So, after decades of reciting jibberish, imagining the undoubtedly wise things I was reciting, I finally sit down to read for understanding what Allah had actually said. Every verse acted like a tiny pinprick against this balloon of belief I'd surrounded myself with.  I couldn't believe the amount of threats this god issued, the lack of wisdom it imparted, the inanity.  THIS is what I was slaving away for?  THIS?  

Happy ending: I became an atheist 1/3rd of the way through the quran.      

BTW: all is well now,* pity - I had decided to put my career on hold to raise our kid because he made enough for us to live on comfortably, and that put us in some discomfort when he died, but with the help of family and a clear atheist head, I went back to school, now have a job that will allow me in a few months more to work from home.  My daughter has an amazing support system, both his family and mine, the phrase of the day is always ""All living things die"" - it just happens that her father was a living thing.  It would have been nice had he lived

I cannot imagine such a tiny little girl forced into sexual intercourse just because she was married to the man who proclaimed he had heard the word of god. I cannot imagine my little cousin born during your time. The horrors she would have to go through. I am thankful she has an amazing childhood, full of toys, learning and happiness.

Aisha, you would understand. If you were here right now, we could save you, we could restore your innocence. We could have given you a normal life.

My little cousin is lucky. She's lucky to be born to liberal parents in a non-Muslim country. She's lucky she doesn't have to go through the things you went through and I have never realized the extent of such horror until today when I couldn't bear the thought of my cousin having to go through what you did.

1376327633.0,1k7u3v,Why Muslim women are required to wear the Hijab.,wazzym,62,11,27,"If you ask a Muslim why Muslim females wear the Hijab (veil) the reason given is usually one of two (or a mixture of both):

They are obeying a command from Allah as given in the Qur'an; it is a matter of piety.

They are protecting their modesty by dressing this way instead of showing their body off for everyone to see.


**Qur'an Ayahs Regarding the Hijab**

* [Qur'an 24:31](http://quran.com/24/31)  Yusuf Ali:And say to the believing women that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty; that they should not display their beauty and ornaments except what (must ordinarily) appear thereof; **that they should draw their veils over their bosoms** and not display their beauty except to their husbands, their sons, their husbands' sons, their brothers or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women, or the slaves whom their right hands possess, or small children who have no sense of the shame of sex; and that they should not strike their feet in order to draw attention to their hidden ornaments. And O ye Believers! turn ye all together towards Allah


* [Quran 33:59](http://quran.com/33/59) 

* Yusuf Ali: O Prophet! Tell thy wives and daughters, that they should be known (as such) and not molested. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.



The first verse above states that the purpose is to hide women's beauty from men. The second verse makes it clear that it is to prevent molestation/harassment whilst traveling. We also do not find any such requirement for Muslim men. Why is this? What are the possible explanations for this?

* Women's beauty is so enticing that men are unable to control themselves if they see an uncovered female - This cannot be right because women do not have to cover themselves in front of those males to whom they are related.

* Women are not attracted to men - Even the casual observer knows this is untrue - the vast majority of women are not asexual.

* Women have more self control than men - This may very well be the case

The current perception in Islamic society is that an unveiled woman is asking to be sexually harassed or assaulted. Although not a guarantee

**Ahadith Regarding the Hijab**

* Narrated `Aisha: The wives of the Prophet () used to go to Al-Manasi, ""I have recognized you, O Sauda."" He said so, as he desired eagerly that the verses of Al-Hijab (the observing of veils by the Muslim women) may be revealed. So Allah revealed the verses of ""Al-Hijab"" (A complete body cover excluding the eyes). http://sunnah.com/bukhari/4/12

* Narrated `Aisha: (the wife of the Prophet) `Umar bin Al-Khattab used to say to Allah's Messenger () ""Let your wives be veiled"" But he did not do so. The wives of the Prophet () used to go out to answer the call of nature at night only at Al-Manasi.' Once Sauda, ""I have recognized you, O Sauda!"" He (`Umar) said so as he was anxious for some Divine orders regarding the veil (the veiling of women.) So Allah revealed the Verse of veiling. (Al-Hijab; a complete body cover excluding the eyes). (See Hadith No. 148, Vol. 1) http://sunnah.com/bukhari/79/14


* 'A'isha reported that the wives of Allah's Messenger () used to go out in the cover of night when they went to open fields (in the outskirts of Medina) for easing themselves. 'Umar b Khattab used to say:
Allah's Messenger, daughter of Zarn'a, the wife of Allah's Messenger (), during one of the nights when it was dark. She was a tall statured lady. 'Umar called her saying: Sauda, we recognise you. (He did this with the hope that the verses pertaining to veil would be revealed.) 'A'isha said: Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, then revealed the verses pertaining to veil. http://sunnah.com/urn/253970

* This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Ibn Shihab with the same chain of transmitters. http://sunnah.com/urn/253980

In short

* 1 Umar repeatedly asks Muhammad that Allah should reveal verses for the Qur'an pertaining to the veiling of women.

* 2 No such revelation is sent down.

* 3 Umar follows Muhammad's wives one night when they go out to relieve themselves (go to the toilet) and calls out to Muhammad's wife Sauda.

* 4 Sauda goes home in a state of embarrassment and relates to Muhammad what has happened.

* 5 Allah then reveals the hijab verse as Umar had wanted all along.

Of course this brings up some obvious questions:

* If Muhammad is just a messenger

* No revelation was sent down until Umar spied on Muhammad's own wives. Why did Umar do this? How did he know (or at least suspect) it would be successful? Why does Allah care about toilet privacy so much that he revealed a verse pertaining to all Muslim women that will ever live?

A common apologetics tactic for this is that Allah was waiting for Umar to do this so that the situational revelation could come down. However this is not mentioned anywhere

**Allah Agrees with Umar**

* Narrated Anas: `Umar said, ""My Lord agreed with me in three things. I said, 'O Allah's Messenger ()! Would that you took the station of Abraham as a place of prayer.' I also said, 'O Allah's Messenger ()! Good and bad persons visit you! Would that you ordered the Mothers of the believers to cover themselves with veils.' So the Divine Verses of Al-Hijab (i.e. veiling of the women) were revealed. I came to know that the Prophet () had blamed some of his wives so I entered upon them and said, 'You should either stop (troubling the Prophet () ) or else Allah will give His Apostle better wives than you.' When I came to one of his wives, she said to me, 'O `Umar! Does Allah's Messenger () haven't what he could advise his wives with, if he divorced you (all) his Lord will give him instead of you
http://sunnah.com/urn/41650

* Narrated `Umar: I said

Ibn Umar reported Umar as saying:
My lord concorded with (my judgments) on three occasions. In case of the Station of Ibrahim

How can the Qur'an be the text that was in existence since before the world began, because after the revelation of the verses he had so wanted, he was at it again

**Umar Spies Again**

* Narrated Aisha: Sauda (the wife of the Prophet) went out to answer the call of nature after it was made obligatory (for all the Muslims ladies) to observe the veil. She was a fat huge lady, you cannot hide yourself from us, so think of a way by which you should not be recognized on going out. Sauda returned while Allah's Messenger () was in my house taking his supper and a bone covered with meat was in his hand. She entered and said, ""O Allah's Messenger ()! I went out to answer the call of nature and `Umar said to me so-and-so."" Then Allah inspired him (the Prophet) and when the state of inspiration was over and the bone was still in his hand as he had not put in down, he said (to Sauda), ""You (women) have been allowed to go out for your needs."" http://sunnah.com/urn/44730

* A'isha reported that Sauda (Allah he pleated with her) went out (in the fields) in order to answer the call of nature even after the time when veil had been prescribed for women. She had been a bulky lady, by Allah, you cannot conceal from us. Therefore, be careful when you go out. She ('A'isha) said: She turned back. Allah's Messenger () was at that time in my house having his evening meal and there was a bone in his hand. She (Sauda) cline and said: Allah's Messenger. I went out and 'Umar said to me so and so. She ('A'isha) reported: There came the revelation to him and then it was over; the bone was then in his hand and he had not thrown it and he said:"" Permission has been granted to you that you may go out for your needs."" http://sunnah.com/urn/253950

Apparently

**Reasoning on the Hijab**

A common claim by Muslims and apologists is that the Hijab protects women against unwanted sexual attention from men. Well known apologist Dr. Zakir Naik takes this line of reasoning in his defense of the hijab mandate. Before evaluating this claim we must examine a few more ahadith:

http://sunnah.com/urn/254160
http://sunnah.com/abudawud/34/88

Evaluating the ""Protection"" Claim
Given the fact that the verses were first revealed after Umar verbally harassed Muhammad's wives while they were going to the toilet, the claim that it is to prevent sexual molestation and not just gossip/verbal harassment is scripturally invalid.

Another interesting thing to note is that all of the verses and ahadith examined so far are to do with Muslim men harassing Muslim females. Thus Allah has revealed this verse to protect the believing women from the believing men.

Furthermore

2) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSfJ89cdRfQ

3) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSfJ89cdRfQ

**Different Types of Veiling**

There are other ahadith that talk of the 'verses of al-hijab' but these are concerning a different type of hijab (veil) with

http://sunnah.com/urn/44690

http://sunnah.com/urn/44700

http://sunnah.com/urn/44710

http://sunnah.com/urn/44720

http://sunnah.com/bukhari/67/101

http://sunnah.com/bukhari/79/12

We see that in addition to the personal hijab, so Allah revealed a verse requiring a separation to put a damper on communication, thereby meaning guests do not stay as long before and after dinner. The above verses are not pertinent to the type of hijab being covered in this article, but have been presented to further highlight the silly circumstances of many of these situational revelations; also to acknowledge that 'hijab' as mentioned in the Qur'an and ahadith do not always refer to the same thing.


**Conclusion** 

The reason that Muslim women wear the hijab today is not a spiritual one, wished that Muhammad would reveal verses from Allah requiring women to wear it. When Muhammad did not oblige, Umar did not consider praying to Allah for assistance. Umar knew he had to make it personal for Muhammad himself in order to bring the revelation down. He followed Muhammad's wives out when they went to go to the toilet and made his presence known. When Muhammad heard of this, the revelation that Umar had so wanted was sent down from Allah. Umar knew where these revelations were really coming from, which is why he went to Muhammad and harassed his wives instead of asking Allah.

Although the revelational circumstances for the hijab may seem comical, because men in non-Islamic societies do not have such self control issues; when it is rare to see a woman covered so in these societies. The hijab's purpose, as revealed and to this day, is designed to protect Muslim females from the now acceptable behavior of Muslim males; behavior which has been deemed socially acceptable precisely because of the requirement of Muslim females to wear the hijab.

I mean I get why you'd be angry

**First of all


I grew up in a strictly-religious family, fast, etc... But as I grew apart from my family, and found inner peace on my own. I pray/fast whenever I want to, but I do slack off sometimes. However, I still believe in the religion. I also believe that Islam is not all about coercion and aggression. I know my parents were wrong, but they didn't get the right education like I've got. I believed all this on my own. 

Anyway, and I should believe that most of you understand what the religion is all about. However, I noticed that most of are actually angry at their parents, not the religion. But this has extended into bashing that religion instead of explaining the real cause of all this anger. **Again** I'm not saying that all of you are wrong into leaving the religion, but, is it really fair to insult Mohammad PBUH, the Holy Book, but do you really think they are to be blamed and scorned at for the troubles caused in your personal life? 

The reason I'm asking this is because I've ran into countless posts about how westerners believe that all Muslims and Arabs are terrorists and bad people. I don't completely blame them because they don't know the whole story, keeping religion aside. So does it not upset you to see vulgar posts about the Prophet or Arabs in general? Do you honestly believe this is what Islam is about? Is every Arab you meet like some of the picture portrayed in here?

So now we skip through stereotypical talks of how they are idolaters
a) I'm not a Muslim anymore
b) I'm a vegetarian


The conversation ends with my mom pushing me to go to the USA there, but as I was searching for ticket prices online my dad called me downstairs.  

There I saw my father putting his coat on with my mother sitting on the couch holding her head and heart with a blood pressure measuring device next to her (my mother's side of the family has a history of unstable blood pressure

So as she's waiting for him I ask her if she wants to go to her room, what she wants me to do, she doesn't answer. I try to stay as calm as possible and hold her hand while my dad's outside. Get her a glass of water and stuff. She also said that ""that news"" was ""just like someone told me that you had cancer or an accident or died"".


Then when my father's finally ready I walk her outside in the snow in my t-shirt and sandals and see them drive off. When I get inside I go up to my desk and just sit and hold my head for thirty minutes and think of what to do. I already sacrificed to much to get here


And that's when I do it, conserving as much space as possible. I put my laptop in its bag, my Windows 8 tablet in my schoolbag, passport, birth certificate, everything I need (at least that's what I think). And that's when I sit back down with a blank piece of paper and a pen. I try to explain in word what I've been through and what I'm going through right now, I try to explain with words, as they say. I finish the goodbye letter with two full sheets.  

Put my clothes on, I'm always the one that feeds her. And go outside, it's 10:30 pm, -10° C., not that cold but there's a snow storm, and I walk the one kilometer street that leads to the bus stop, wait 30 minutes, take the metro. At 00:45 get to my stop and wait for the bus, I can't see anything


Now I'm at my new desk in my new apartment in Brussels. Everything I ever wanted from the start right? Ever since I became an atheist right? Then why do I feel like I want to cry, what do I know? I might be wrong, I'm just a kid after all.

During my hiatus from here,  Jean-Paul Sartre, Søren Aabye Kierkegaard and the infamous Friedrich Nietzsche went from being deceased, easily quotable figures to hard-won allies along the lonely and arduous journey towards recovery.

In my readings I cannot help but draw some comparisons and parallels with the philosophical implications I’ve come across

Take for instance, because the rock would eventually just roll down the mountain due to its own weight. Sisyphus would then have to roll the rock up the mountain again…and again…and again…ad infinitum through all eternity.

This is a kind of symbol to what Camus famously refers to as: **The Absurd.** As you might be able to slightly sympathize with Sisyphus’ plight

Sounds [**familiar**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salah)

The notion of the absrud is a special one. While it’s not exactly a technical term, and occasionally find the concept of a sentient sea sponge that befriends a Texan, underwater-dwelling squirell to be quite ridiculous. You might go out for a walk in the middle of the night and notice someone wearing sunglasses for fashionable reasons rather than practical ones, something which most people would agree to be rather silly.

Camus’s notion of the absurd is one that has overtaken modern sensibilities. It is a metaphysical thesis suggesting that the human understanding of the absurd is in fact a confrontation: a confrontation between two sides of the human mind. On one side you have the “rational” mind; a mind that expects justice

You might argue that it is part of human nature to care about each other. As many philosophers have argued, we project these senses onto the universe, expecting it to fulfil our demands and reciprocate our understandings of justice and fairness. To use a simple example, we expect evil to be punished. Acts of kindness should be rewarded. This raises the arguably ancient problem of evil, one that goes back to the middle ages. The fact that virtue is not always rewarded. The all too obvious fact that evil deeds sometimes go away unpunished. This problem has always proved to be quite a conundrum to theological thinkers. However, without even alluding to religion, one can argue that dealing with evil in everyday life is actually a problem for all of us.

The absurd is this recognition that we have certain demands and expectations from the world around us

In the end of one of Camus’ brilliant works, and that upon reflection, even *he* is just who he is, and intrestingly enough, he accepts that.

There is a sense in which one might say the absurd would cease to be a problem if we believe in God. The truth is

Camus even famously says: “Even if there were a God

I personally think that understanding these philosophical arguments and how they stack up against the Islamic schools of thought can be an essential, with the ultimate aim of encouraging everyone to be able to cultivate an insatiable appetite for trying to answer some of life's most pressing questions...especially upon the realization that most of the answers you have been given as a young Muslim have been patently and demonstrably false.

I hope that you will come away from these essays with not only a better understanding of the universe around you, yet immesurably precious moments of existence.

I'm livid right now. A lot of you know that my parents took my siblings from the US to Jordan 2 months ago to ""give them a better life"". My dad is a deadbeat who has been unemployed (by choice) since 2010 and has no intention of getting a job. They live off of a weekly allowance his family gives them and they don't pay housing costs there since his parents own the building.

Today, thinking it's totally cool to curse someone's mother. They pulled a gun on my entire family in the car at a light and told them they were gonna die, and the only reason they didn't kill them right then was because there were young girls in the car. I don't care if this was just a threat. I don't care if there was any chance the gun could have been a fake. My 5 yr old sister witnessed a gun being pointed at her by a psycho with road rage today in a place where he'd likely never get arrested for it. My siblings were horrified, and are still shaken up. My parents see no issue with this. None. Those men could have followed them home. They could have done awful things. For all I fucking know they just might. 

There was no reason to move to Jordan. They had free housing here

They've pulled my siblings out of school. My siblings don't speak Arabic. They're American kids. They now have to go to shitty Arabic schools with no means to teach American kids because my parents can't afford the good private English schools. 

They also can't afford much food. He gets $700 USD a week from his family to support 7 people. That's their entire income. So far they've been there less than 2 months and he's had to spend hundreds of JOD's on my sisters health. She got food poisoning and they wouldn't take her to the hospital until she wouldn't wake up one day. They're literally letting these kids live like shit and it's okay to them. When he had to pay a ton for all the medicines she needed and the days of hospital care and IV's

When I asked my mother why they couldn't just come back

.....My mom is 44, scared, and my psycho Muslim dad doesn't GAF as long as he's doing what he wants when he wants. He doesn't give them a dime. They have no money, hardly any food and he's happy because my sisters can't sneak out at night in amman. He gets to trap them and live how he wants. 

My siblings (apart from my rapist brother) are all budding exmoose who are living in pure hell right now. My heart breaks for them and I wish I could get them home. I learned today he will come back to the US every year to complete his tax return to get a refund on his ""allowance"" (which is complete fraud....I've reported him multiple times to no avail) while keeping the kids trapped in Jordan.


EDIT: last part cut off. Fixed.

The battle you’re going through with your families or communities aren’t a test of your courage

I’m out. I want to scream it from the rooftops. I’m living in an environment which is about fifty steps lower than the luxury I was used to but *I just don’t care*. My house might smell of old ladies (airing it out/glade-ing the frick out of it seems to disguise it temporarily), free to control my own diet, free to go out and do whatever the hell I like. And do you know what I’ve discovered? Everyday is surprisingly not filled with drinking, premarital sex and an assortment of drug trialing/abortions. Shockingly enough, I barely drink except a glass or two socially (rarely, AND I MADE FRIENDS because of the confidence with not wearing a scarf and not being the ""token scarf friend"") and have also discovered I have an allure of sorts to men when I want to! Go figure.

Back on topic, confident middle-eastern woman who don’t need no man. Because the hijab’s off, I feel more confident and it doesn’t feel wrong to be happy/feel normal/be included/ be myself. I made a whole bunch of non-religiously associated friends who are nerdy, a little insane and studious just like me so things are super positive at my end, finally. My relationship with my parents has somewhat disintegrated into pleasantries and to be perfectly frank with you, this is perhaps the best outcome for me.

Being able to be yourself is a privilege and has such a degree of satisfaction associated with it that most things you had in your old life fade away. I miss my best friends at home dreadfully

So everyone struggling right now, the world is bigger and brighter than you could’ve imagined, filled with people you only imagined in your deepest wishes and I promise that EVERYTHING will stop hurting.

I love you all. Thank you all for being here for me when I needed you. I am in your debt and will continue to serve the ex-Muslim community. Speaking of which, I've worked through my prelim lectures and the first lecture, made my notes for it and I AM ALL OF THE PREPARED.

I came out to my best friend. I invited him to my house one day, and he said no. 

A relative of his, you're agnostic, right?"" (I was at the time) I stared at him, dumbfounded. Luckily, out of those friends, only two of them knew the meaning of agnostic. One was the best friend, and the other was a liberal fellow who already knew apostates in other cities. 

Note that I did not attempt to deconvert anyone. I simply told those two friends why I left Islam. The best friend is now completely irreligious, his father turned out to be an atheist (living in a liberal society for two  years probably helped). I guess not every household is as conservative as mine, he was never religious to begin with (still surprised at what happened though). I told two other friends of my religious status, both of them Hindu. One of them is of the idea now that religion shouldn't exist (yet he has forced me to offer salat in the past), another one is still amazed at my apostasy. So all in all, 5 people in real life know of my apostasy. 

I probably wasn't the only influence on my friends in their ""turning away"" from their respective religions

Edit: I feel like I should emphasize this again. Safety is the first priority. I'm sure most of you are very cautious individuals, to get it off your chest. Do not come out to anyone in real life, unless you are absolutely sure that that person will keep the news of your apostasy to themselves, and won't hate you for it.

I'm finally ready to share my plans with you about my project.

The project in question is in fact a feature-length documentary film about apostates of Islam. It will tell the story of their struggles

I will be the producer

***********************************************************

**Subject Matter**:

In many predominantly Muslim countries

No matter where those debates lead, persecution, and even death.

This is especially a concern in today’s world where true privacy is quickly becoming a thing of the past. A few minutes of internet use can leave a digital trail that can be used against unassuming apostates to track them down. This forces them to take multiple measures of safety to ensure that all their interactions with their fellow ex-Muslims be more anonymous and harder to trace.

These ex-Muslims become especially frustrated when they see their former brethren engaging in acts of barbarism and wallowing in cognitive dissonance

**Purpose:**

The documentary will primarily consist of interviews with fellow apostates, with no fear of death threats being leveled at us simply because we don't believe in certain unsubstantiated claims.

These interviews will also go over how these apostates see Islam today

**Intended Audience**:

The audience will be anyone who has a vested interest in Islamic affairs

**Approach:**

I will personally travel to where these apostates call their home

Most of you already know that as an apostate myself

**Why are you doing this?**

This is an issue that hits very close to home for all of us. To put it simply: I am monumentally frustrated that people like us have to deal with circumstances that we have no choice but to deal with on a daily basis.

If we want our situation to improve

This film is by no means a solution to the problem

**When will you start shooting?**

The film will take the entirety of 2013 to pull off

**Is there anything I can do to help?**

I will be launching an IndieGoGo campaign this upcoming **Wednesday

The funds will go towards 1/4th of the total production and distribution costs, as well as travel expenses.

Even if I don't raise as much as a nickel, the project will take much longer, with a projected release date of 2015.

If you would like to spread the word about the film

http://www.facebook.com/guiltismygod

The page is still in its infancy

I will post the IndieGoGo page on /r/atheism

***********************************************************

Before I end this post

Remember:

This movie is about *you*, then I will personally see to it that it will be addressed.

I will always come back here to update everyone

I'm sure you have far more questions and concerns than what I've covered here

Thank you all for inspiring me.

Due to issues regarding the IndieGoGo page that are out of my control

**""""The incident relating to King Chakrawati Farmas is documented in an old manuscript in the India Office Library, 2807, 152-173. It is quoted in the book “Muhammad Rasulullah,” by M. Hamidullah:**

&gt;   *“There is a very old tradition in Malabar, one of their kings, had observed the splitting of the moon, the celebrated miracle of the Holy Prophet (pbuh) at Mecca, and learning on inquiry that there was a prediction of the coming of a Messenger of God from Arabia, he appointed his son as regent and set out to meet him. He embraced Islam at the hand of the Prophet, and when returning home, died at the port of Zafar

I'm so glad I found this subreddit

I remember when I left Islam clearly, knowing I had nowhere to go and knew very few people.

When I lived with my family

So there I was at dinner

I suddenly realized how great all these people were around me, but here religion didn't matter. I could tell all these people were good, and my religion was clearly wrong.

When the turkey (non-halal) came around to me

At that dinner, I didn't die, no, I just kept having a good time with people who are still close friends, and I wasn't muslim anymore. 

Many more events unfolded after this, or finally interacting and pursuing women for the first time-- each that has an interesting story in it’s own right, but that night was a turning point. Since then, I have rarely felt guilty for pointless things. I've been much more assertive in my life, and heading in direction I really like. It opened the doors to all kinds of new experiences in food, drink, love

I'd love to hear your experiences.

I loved the Power Rangers, I tingled with the virginal glow of smiles together with goosebumps when the good guys in movies used the big awesome guns and the fancy gadget-shit to fight the bad guys. Pew pew pew! *booom!* And I loved magicians and illusionists who could pull off some of the most amazing tricks, where the crowds would get up of their chairs and cheer and whoop with joy.

And so, imagined it, and opened your eyes to find it was there. You'd never be bored, everyone would be happy, everything would be so so perfect, I mean, you wouldn't even need to poop!

So we kids would stare at each other with smiles, we'd chatter away at all the awesome things that we'd have in our mansions in heaven, we'd bicker on for hours and have updates each day about new things we're going to add to our palace. When I would watch TV, I'd actually be making a mental list of all the cool things that I'd be able to do in heaven, for real. Without the CGI. Doing the impossible. Racing a car at 250 mph, pushing a super secret button and having it turn into a submarine before the wings and rocket boosters come out and jetting off into space for interplanetary travel, whilst not forgetting to take a few parachutes.

It was such a drug, and I'd read quran actively, rocking back and forth, thinking about all the extra brownie points I'll be earning with Allah. ""One letter = 10 sawaab!"", my mosque teachers would say.

My life has had its ups and downs and now here I sit writing this out. I am 20 years old. Thinking about my childhood makes me feel funny and want to laugh, because. I only know me. And it's a waste of time to think about if the past was different.

Okay, and whether the time has come to stop throwing flower necklaces and start critically looking at the history of Islam and weighing up the moral arguments which attempt to justify that creepy and bipolar god in the quran.

It hurts to see my parents, all to no avail. A few eyebrows raised occasionally, but for the wrong reasons - I would find them were becoming hysterical, thinking I was blaspheming. You have to persist, yes, but give the baby it's candy or whatever it wants to hear because... well, the situation just bloody well calls for it!

Arg. Okay, let me find it...

I've been getting really relaxed with my parents since I'm moving soon. Really

Today I received a strange political email from baba asking me to check his grammar and spelling as English isn't his first language. I sent him back an email explaining his choice of words made it near impossible for me to understand and that I needed him to explain it better when I got home. Turns out my dad is part of a group of Shia Muslims who are trying to form a political party for Shia Muslims in this country. I stared at him

The reason why they're forming this political party is because the Muslim member of parliament betrayed them by supporting legalization of prostitution (see: inaction)

I feel very strongly pro-gay marriage. I've researched it thoroughly and in honesty it is one of the main reasons for my apostasy. So I defended gay marriage. Second big mistake. My mum was in the same room. She says to me ""Avocadoeh, but as long as we didn't conflict with other peoples rights we'd be able to coexist.

She (note: she is a registered doctor) said: ""Don't you understand that homosexuality is wrong? Don't you see? Where did AIDS come from? Them. All the diseases, and then she became religious? What about y and z, their mother died and now their religious? Do I have to die? Do you want me to die? Oh, please, Lord, I wish to die tomorrow. How could you do this to me? You make me a failed parent.""- she proceeded to scream at God to kill her tomorrow.

My father who has always seemed accepting, who rallied for gay marriage and legalisation of prostitution. I laughed, stupidly because I thought it was hilarious how wrong he was. My father then said ""This is enough. We would not have raised you as we did to make you turn out like filth. All the years of hard work we put in to you- in the greying of my beard, sending you to a private school and letting you learn to use all your intelligence and energy and passion in doing the exact things that are wrong and against us. You are a disgrace.""

My mother rounded up that conversation with saying ""All the other families

Mama ran away from me

It hurts to think that they don't see me as the same person. I am exactly the same person as I was, I'm less depressed and I am in so many ways a much stronger person now post-Islam than I could ever have been while still a Muslim. As a Muslim I had more suicidal behaviours than I ever did as an ex-. I've become a much better person. At least I think so. Did I?

Humans- we victimise ourselves. And I can't help but wondering if I'm not the victim here. That I'm wrong. That I did poison myself, tainted. No wonder they say apostates deserve death, cause if they're the victim then I should be killed. I can't unfuck myself up. Diseases- should be controlled and destroyed. What if I'm the disease?

And I'm just so angry. At God for not existing or if he does exist for NOT FUCKING PROVING IT WHEN I BEGGED AND PRAYED FOR SO GOD DAMN LONG. I'm so fucking mad at myself for not controlling todays conversation. There's so many things I wish for right now and I wish today never happened. I wish God existed because it'd take a miracle to get everything back to the way they were between us. I can't.

I'm still moving. My flight's set on for the 12th of February. They can't stop me from leaving nor can they control me once I get there. But they're my *parents*. Doesn't that mean anything? Doesn't it?

I just don't know what to do from now until then. Does anyone know what I can do aside from stick to day-by-day activities and keep my head down? I have no idea. I have nothing. No one else understands. Please. I need you.

I have to deal with two going away dinners (one strictly Arab

We do not share your faith anymore and yet most of us feel close to you. We disagree with Muhammad's teachings and yet most of us don't hold a grudge for him. We reject _some_ ethical requirements and scientific claims in Islam and yet most of us haven't turned into Satan's worshipers.

It is true that sometimes we vent our frustration in this subreddit or elsewhere because we are humans just as you are. Many have rejected the idea of Allah's existence

In truth, because there is some good in it. But Islam is an abstract concept, an all-or-nothing system of belief, so are all world's religions. Reason rejects dogmas, scientific inaccuracy and unacceptable statements. So those of us who were reasonable enough couldn't help rejecting the wrong in Islam, and felt compelled to reject faith as a whole, that very faith they loved so much

Most of you accept that other nations have different religions, freethinkers are ostracized, jailed, silenced and sometimes put to death. If Quraysh did not loosen their policy toward early Muslims, there would not be Islam at all ; and yet early Muslims have gradually turned from oppressed to oppressors. Muslims don't accept that other religions or even secular thinkers spread the word in their land, whereas in the West they overtly invite others to embrace Islam, precisely because the West is a land of freedom. This sounds like a double standards : fine abroad

What I am asking you is not to embrace irreligion, those among you who have chosen a different way. In other words, I am asking you the right to exist for freethinkers, the right to enjoy living in our own countries with our people - Muslim people we love and among which are our parents, siblings, friends and neighbors - without being persecuted or fearing for our lives.

Of course, but if your faith is truth and can stand rational arguments, then you don't have anything to fear for. If not, then you might judge for yourself who is right and who is wrong and grant yourself an additional opportunity to strengthen your faith (or reject it if you deem fit) and maybe bring back to the right path those who were led astray, in which case you would be rewarded.

I think it is a fair deal

These aren't in any particular order. Please elaborate (if you agree with any point) or add a criticism to the list. Thank you.

* This subreddit is islamophobic.

* There's a lot of misogyny here. Some of the members are inappropriate and creepy with their comments.

* The exmuslims here were never really Muslims or don't know Islam well enough.

* Most of us left the religion due to bad experiences with Muslims.

* We are rude and snarky.

* A lot of us quit Islam because of the strict rules. We left so we could eat pork

* We hate progressive and liberal Muslims. We support those Muslims who think we should be killed for our apostasy than those who would speak against it.

* We've disabled downvotes because we can't handle criticism or dissent.

* The mod(s) are oppressive. They'll tell you to shut the fuck up and will silence any dissent.

* The mods are too easy going with trolls and the like.

* r/exmuslim conducts downvote brigades.

* There are too many memes and shitty posts here.

* This sub shouldn't be just about recovery.

* This sub isn't focused enough on recovery.

* This sub doesn't do anything for the truly oppressed exmuslim in third world countries.

* zulaikha_idris

* This subreddit is filled with people too obsessed with Islam and Muslims to ever move forward.

* Get over r/islam already.

* This subreddit is anti-Arab.

* We are Zionist shills.

* This subreddit can be a depressing place and can trigger bad memories and emotions.

* We support right wingers and bigots.

* There isn't enough intelligent posts or original content.

Relation to me is that they're my aunt's/mom's cousins and aunt/uncle.
The cousins are men and are married, the convert is the most tolerable. The aunt/uncle (I call them my grandparents) are elderly, the uncle is from Suriname and the Aunt is Pakistani.

I realized that was complicated. All you need to know is that the there are two women who married into the family


**""I won't eat halaal KFC because KFC is owned by kaafirs and you cannot trust kaafirs.""**

The Surinamese uncle refused to go eat at the Zabeeha Halal KFC because he kept arguing that KFC is owned by Kaafirs and you cannot trust them. He kept going on and on about how every man will answer for himself on Qiyaama. Even as a vegetarian

**""Her job is to learn how to take care of her husband and daughter.""**

The Viet-American moved to the Netherlands then converted. So she's only learning Dutch, they blame her.

My own aunt forced her to make a Pakistani dish

They also argued that there's no need for her to learn Dutch (even though she fucking lives in a Dutch-speaking country) because Urdu is her daughter's language.... I didn't realize mother-tongue was actually father-tongue (her husband is the one that knows urdu)....

**""It's better to learn to cook what your husband likes

Both of the girls that married into the family are not good with desi food. This ends up a source of ridicule and anger, I'd be pissed as hell.

**""Menopause is a bad word.""**

One of the male cousins flipped shit when the other one said the word ""menopause."" I asked why he was making such a god damn deal over it because it's a natural human process. He said

Body shame and degradation of women will make me hate you like no other. Islamic cultures have serious period shame epidemics

I should point out

**""The Netherlands is so bad for Muslims. We wanna come to America.""**

Siting nudity and the ban on halal chicken as forms of persecution

**""Horse meat is haraam because horses are smart.""**

Of course I'm gonna go veg-shit on you guys, are halal. But she claimed it was a Bukhari hadith) are so smart, that's why you cannot have horse meat except in dire conditions. 

How convenient it is to believe doctrine over science. Forgetting that pigs are smarter than human toddlers

**""We're not playing with the dog. Kill it.""**

Our neighbors are abusive and neglectful of their dog. The dog broke through the fence and of course freaked these little Muslims out. After I lead her back, the lawn was an untamed mess, the toys were raggedy and all over. I called animal control and reported the issue. Went inside to get water for the poor dog.. was told ""we don't wanna make that dog think she's allowed here. Kill her."" 
Of course they forget the story of the poor man who fed water to a dog and God rewarded him or some shit like that.

**""Put on another shirt. You're a girl.""**

As some of you may remember, I am consistently degraded to skin and cleavage. This time, however, in front of these adult guests, my aunt decided it not only acceptable to tell the women how big of a burden my chest is (infer whatever details you want, cause she said it all) but also, when I told her she had no reason to tell these people my personal life

1346690345.0,zab98,Christian Woman Reads the Koran and Becomes an Atheist,Imhotepa,50,3,8,"Ok
I’ve been lurking since Ramadan days

Quick back story: Raised catholic light, and they said “to give us something” and I suspect a strong dose of guilt from their parents.  Went to Uni, church days were a distance memory.  Got set up on blind date with wonderful muslim foreign born man.  Fell in love.  Got married.
  
Of course it was more complicated than that.  Though he is clearly super moderate, that still have a few vines firmly implanted in him.

   We played the catholic card when meeting his family and they still put up a hullabaloo, and they finally decided that the quicker we got married the quicker we would get divorced and he could find his local, muslim wife.  (yup, his dad actually said that)  So we had a nice big wedding in each country, and to their credit, his family, other than normal annoying in-law stuff

So the kids you ask?  
Early in the relationship, secretly hoping that islam will function as an inoculants does, stamping out more virulent future strains of irrationalism.  And if it doesn’t, oh well, they’re my kids. 
 My husband has never read the Koran.  He’s a nice person, a lot which are just silly, and a couple which I find disgusting.   
So my question for redditors:  How hard should I poke the Dragon?  I’m not asking if I should encourage him to become a disbeliever, that having sex with slaves was haram, etc, until I showed him exactly what it said in the Koran.  He quickly wouldn’t even let me use sahih hadiths.   He is suffering from severe cognitive dissonance, and admits he just doesn’t understand why those things are allowed, and he is sure someone has the reason.  It’s clear the strength of his convictions lie in his connections to his family and culture.  He feels a lot of guilt for moving away from his family.  He has admitted that he would still be a muslim if it was proven that allah wasn’t real, which I think says a lot. I see positive and negatives on both sides, so thanks!

In summation, better achieving individual. Because of this, when my mother asked me to come back to live with them for the duration of my intersemester break, I accepted, thinking it would be refreshing to go back.

This is not the case.

To everyone who is considering going back

Don't do it. If you're anything like me, staying at home or else have a ridiculous curfew of 4pm, cleaning for them and going to mosques.

Don't think you can spare the heart ache, *old life* too much. Because you do, but it's better when it's a long distance sort of relationship. It's healthier this way when you don't have to see your family, be underneath the same rules, restrictions, feelings and obligations. Like going to the mosque and having to pretend to be a Muslim all over again. It deeply traumatises you, inside and outside all over again.

I've been back for only a few days and I detest it. My body, uncertain, unconfident and introverted person I was forced to be under those obligations as an Ideal Muslimah. This person is not who I am.

I'm thankful I get to leave earlier as I managed to catch a really early flight back home through using the excuse of re enrolment. I'll be home shortly.

I was in Seoul for the weekend

I'm wandering around the foreigner district. Suddenly, white mosque.

I wander up, examining the beautiful inlaying on all the surfaces and flipping through a Quran.

In walk a rather quick talking bearded Pakistani fellow in a white kurta. I start talking with him.

Being an evangelizer, he would be very honored if I join. I'm always curious about different cultures, and open, so I say OK.

Soon, stand up, say some more stuff in Arabic, etc.

Finally, repeat this after me. ""لا إله إلا الله محمد رسول الله!!!"" 

Me..""Uh..what? Um..ok...لا إله إلا الله محمد رسول الله ....""

Him: ""Now

Me: ""mumble mumble (I'm basically a new-ager hippy type; I believe in a higher power, mohammed is a prophet."" 

Him, I AM SO EXCITED!!! TAKE THIS HAT!!""

Crowd: *CHEERS* Every one of these kurta wearing fellows (only 1 or 2 Korean

Me: ""Umm...umm...hey

Crowd files out. It's just me and the first Pakistani fellow again.

Him: ""Congratulations, take your picture, that sort of thing.""

Me: ""(WTF? Paperwork? Pictures?) Umm...you know..I'm really late, meet a friend in five minutes down in itaewon central...""

He tried and tried to convince me

Sometimes I wish I had made some bold pronouncement of the folly of organized religion in front of that crowd

1376176933.0,1k45ie,Has the Quran been perfectly Preserved?,wazzym,51,9,21,"Muslims say the Qur'an has been perfectly preserved

**FIRST PROBLEM**

The most trusted collection of hadith and considered the most authentic book after the Qur'an is Sahih Bukhari but even within it's own book there is a contradiction on who collected the Qur'an.

* Narrated Qatada:
  I asked Anas bin Malik: ""Who collected the Qur'an at the time of the Prophet () ?"" He replied, Mu`adh bin Jabal, Zaid bin Thabit and Abu Zaid.""** http://sunnah.com/bukhari/66/25


* Narrated Anas bin Malik:
  When the Prophet () died

If you cannot even agree on who collected the Qur'an then how can you even begin to claim the Qur'an is intact exactly how it was revealed?

**SECOND PROBLEM**


We know from the hadith that Muhammad himself forgot parts of the Qur'an:

* Narrated `Aisha:
The Prophet () heard a reciter reciting, as he has remind ed me of such-and-such Verses of such and-such Suras, which I missed!"" http://sunnah.com/bukhari/66/66

* Narrated Aisha:
The Prophet () heard a man reciting the Qur'an in the mosque and said

* A'isha reported that the Apostle of Allah () heard a person reciting the Qur'an at night. Upon this he said:
May Allah show mercy to him; he has reminded me of such and such a verse which I had missed in such and such a surah.
http://sunnah.com/muslim/6/265

Allah in the Qur'an says that even His messenger might forget certain verses.

Yusuf Ali
By degrees shall We teach thee to declare (the Message)

In the below hadith we see that Muhammad's companions also forgot passages of the Qur'an.

* Narrated `Abdullah:
The Prophet () said, in fact, is caused (by Allah) to forget."" http://sunnah.com/bukhari/66/63

* Ibn Mas'ud reported Allah's Messenger () as saying:
Wretched is the man who says: I forgot such and such a sura

If the prophet is forgetting verses then how can you say that you have the perfect unaltered word of God with you?


**Third Problem**

There are claims in the hadith that certain verses are missing. For example the 'stoning verse' for adultery. The present day Qur’an does not contain the penalty of Rajm (stoning) for adulterers

*  Abdullah b. 'Abbas reported that 'Umar b. Khattab sat on the pulpit of Allah's Messenger () and said:
Verily Allah sent Muhammad () with truth and He sent down the Book upon him, after him, we also awarded the punishment of stoning, I am afraid that with the lapse of time, the people (may forget it) and may say: We do not find the punishment of stoning in the Book of Allah, and thus go astray by abandoning this duty prescribed by Allah. Stoning is a duty laid down in Allah's Book for married men and women who commit adultery when proof is established, or it there is pregnancy


Al-Nurayn and al-Wilaya are two surahs (chapters) that are claimed to be included in the Qur'an by some Shi'ite sects. These sects would supposedly argue that Ali had a different copy of the Qur'an as compared with the third Caliph Uthman. However



**FIFTH PROBLEM**

We know from various sources that the ~~first~~ third caliph Uthman ordered various copies of the Qur'an to be burnt because there were clear differences in the recitation of Qur'an among people of Sham and people of Iraq. The differences were so great Uthman and his companions feared future dispute about true Qur'an. (We are not talking about pronunciations

* Narrated Anas bin Malik:
Hudhaifa bin Al-Yaman came to `Uthman at the time when the people of Sham and the people of Iraq were Waging war to conquer Arminya and Adharbijan. Hudhaifa was afraid of their (the people of Sham and Iraq) differences in the recitation of the Qur'an, ""Send us the manuscripts of the Qur'an so that we may compile the Qur'anic materials in perfect copies and return the manuscripts to you."" Hafsa sent it to `Uthman. `Uthman then ordered Zaid bin Thabit, `Abdullah bin AzZubair, Sa`id bin Al-As and `AbdurRahman bin Harith bin Hisham to rewrite the manuscripts in perfect copies. `Uthman said to the three Quraishi men, ""In case you disagree with Zaid bin Thabit on any point in the Qur'an, then write it in the dialect of Quraish, the Qur'an was revealed in their tongue."" They did so, `Uthman returned the original manuscripts to Hafsa. `Uthman sent to every Muslim province one copy of what they had copied


**SIX PROBLEM**

The compilation of the Qur'an was clearly a very human process involving trial and error, fallible opinions, disagreements, mistakes, ignorance, and bad decisions. And we can't forget, of course

* Abu Harb b. Abu al-Aswad reported on the authority of his father that Abu Musa al-Ash'ari sent for the reciters of Basra. They came to him and they were three hundred in number. They recited the Qur'an and he said:

 You are the best among the inhabitants of Basra, forgotten it with the exception of this which I remember out of it:"" If there were two valleys full of riches, for the son of Adam, he would long for a third valley, and nothing would fill the stomach of the son of Adam but dust."" And we used so recite a slirah which resembled one of the surahs of Musabbihat, and I have forgotten it, but remember (this much) out of it:"" Oh people who believe

http://sunnah.com/muslim/12/156

The earliest found copies of the Qur'an do not have diacritical marks, are missing from the Qur'an we have today. We can thus conclude from Islamic sources that the Qur'an has not been perfectly preserved and today's text is not exactly the same as recited by Muhammad. http://sunnah.com/muslim/12/156

**OTHER PROBLEMS**

Nobody has the original copy of the Qur'an standardized by Uthman.

The most trusted commentary on preservation comes from hadith written hundreds of years after Muhammad.

Early copies of the Qur'an did not have [diacretical](http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Diacritical_Marks_of_the_Qur%27an) marks

**CONCLUSION** 

The earliest found copies of the Qur'an do not have diacritical marks, are missing from the Qur'an we have today. We can thus conclude from Islamic sources that the Qur'an has not been perfectly preserved and today's text is not exactly the same as recited by Muhammad.

1371237462.0,1gcumc,Being hit for the first time,Th3MetalHead,43,2,71,"A rant i guess. I know a lot of you have been to worse but i still need to talk out to someone. 

I live with a pretty liberal mom but a fucked up crazy dad. I'm 16 and my mom has made sute that my dad doesn't hurt me whatsoever not like he did with my siblings. He's known for hitting and beating everyone within our family even my mom until i was born. My mom claims i made him ease up. 

Yesterday there was a party planned by the city for all people aged between 15-18. I of course see this as agreat opportunity to hang out with my friends one last time before we part ways. I told my mom the party starts at 8pm and finishes at 1 o'clock. She said yes and i even had 2 friends sleeping over. 

Now my dad knew about this but as I missed the bus at 1 o'clock and had my brother come pick me up and my friends. While on the phone with my mom he was shouting in arabic ""let the fucker walk home"" and he grabbed the phone and said ""just wait you just wait til tomorrow"" amd hung up. Now I've done worse in my days so i shrugged it off. 

Well today he calls me and trlls me to stay home until he gets there because he wants to talk. Meanwhile my mom is all cool about yesterday and eager to hear what happened. As my mom is sick she sleeps on the couch and my dad comes through the door. He looks at me and says let's go downstairs and talk. I follow and sit down on the bed.

He starts asking ""where were you yesterday?"" ""As you know at the festival thing"" ""when did you come home?"" "" well i missed the bus and i got her at 2"" this is where i paralyzed. He spit at my face and slapped me so hard. And he's saying stuff i can't even remember. I feel that buzzing sound in my ears. He looks at me and still saying stuff and spits and then hits again and this time laying on me with his fists all in the air wanting to continue. 

My mom wakes up and screams what's going on? And he in his most fake voice. ""Nothing honey"" he then forces me up the stairs and tells me to bring my bus card and my phone (hid my phone) he said i won't be out past 8 and that he'll shut off internet (yeah right)

My mom now knows what's up and gets furious and tells him what's wrong with you? And he said the thing that has made me despise him for all future. ""He's my son if i want to kill him I'll do that"".

My mom came in to my room and started talking to me about how fucked up he used to be and how she want me to get the best grades so when she dies i can move away from him. She sat there hugging me and praying for my good fortune in the future. Do admit that was pretty comforting. She told me that she told him that if he touches me again she'll move away with me.

 I just feel so lost and alone. In 16 years he hasn't layed hands on anyone until today. Mom thinks he's jealous because im more successful with life than what he is but i don't know. Thanks

Dreams are fairly hard to recollect

His advice seemed to be somewhat relevant to my fellow brothers and sisters here

**NOTE:** Please excuse the language. My father was rather upset

Without further ado:

***********************************************************

Fuck you.

Fuck your fears. Fuck your need to wallow in emotional bullshit that will only serve to leave you suspended in a demobilizing black syrup. Fuck the long walks you take at 3 AM in the morning

I’m not here anymore.

I'm not here to give you any reassurance. I'm not here to share dirty jokes with you anymore. I'm not here to watch Looney Tunes and Steve Martin movies together for hours until we lose track of time.

I don’t have much time so I’m going to keep this short:

Never borrow another man’s past.

Never smile at a woman just as you’re entering the restroom.

Never be afraid of death. Death is merely a reminder that you won the lottery. That you are one of chosen few who get to experience the universe in all of its terrifying beauty.

By the way...you must be wondering what happened after I died.

Judgement? Rivers of honey and wine? 72 virgins? Sorry

You die…and then you die. And then you don’t come back.

I know you don’t believe in any of the Islamic bullshit I tried ramming down your throat ever since you learned how to walk. I know we’ve had some disagreements

I don't expect you to forgive me

I know you're an atheist.

Your family doesn’t know it

For your mother’s sake

But you’re not a man yet. Not in my book

You want to know why?

Because a real man will harbor a love for his family that is so strong and resolute that it transcends his own beliefs. So strong that it rises above his vitriolic strain of atheism that often gets the best of his emotions. He will care for them no matter what they believe in. He will save any vacuous, and give his family their due in respect, and then some.

You don’t have time to let this all sink in. I won’t give you that time. I’m buried under 10 feet of dirt

I’m very much out of time. You

That’s why I want you to take this advice down your throat like a hockey puck

I don’t want you to wake up thinking I’m an asshole.

I don’t want you to wake up thinking that I’m anything more than the manifestation of your own hopelessly convoluted

I also really don’t want you to wake up with some misguided notion that I’m not proud of you.

But I want you to wake up a man.

Now, it's better than California (sorry, JasonMacker) but much worse if we compare it to our fellow ex-Muslim's in the UK. The thing is is that we're on reddit. Not everyone is on reddit. Imagine how many others are out there? One of our regulars suggested we have regular meet-ups. This suggestion is golden for many reasons.

 - By taking this offline and meeting in person, we can ttract those who identify as non-Muslim, atheists, skeptics, ""cultural"" Muslms, etc. Imagine that. Imagine us networking and putting the word out there that we're for real and we have a community that is accepting and supportive -- which leads me to my next point.

 - Support. This subreddit is first and foremost a place for recovery. Most of us don't have that in our day-to-day interactions. Some struggle. Most of us have experienced strguggles. By gathering together

 - We can share ideas. We can debate. We can discuss our experiences and continuously learn and grow together. Our meet-ups aren't really circle jerks. Our members that show up have always provide a fresh perspective. Not to mention

So, so, if you need a voucher, we can put on our beards and sing 'Alhamdilullah' into your mother's ear.

While you might have all the reason in the world to hate those religious believers including your parents, I would like to hear your perspective. Maybe I've taken too seriously certain comments that were only intended to be cathartic rants meant to dispose of angered emotions? Nonetheless, I think those sentiments might hold some truth, so here goes:

1. People are not always religious, idiots. Many have been indoctrinated since their infancy in cultures where Islam has dominated for hundreds of years. It may have never seriously occurred to these people that their way of life is based on falsehoods—that the miracles and stories they've heard about could be false. In a [recent thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1aqo4y/do_you_think_you_would_be_an_atheist_today_if_it/), many of you alluded to the idea that if it weren't for the internet and an inkling of skepticism, you may yet have been Muslims. It may be very difficult for Muslims to really critically think of something that they have been so committed to for their entire lifetime.

2. Many staunch religious believers like some of our immigrant parents have come from countries where the West is viewed as [selfish, but there is some context to their views. So when and if you come out, your parents and friends might simply interpret this as you succumbing to the Western ways and be dismissive of your logic.

3. My perspective isn't just that the believers aren't dumb and ignorant, and even talented contributors to society, even in complicated fields. For whatever reason, these individuals hold on to their beliefs. While you and I may be fairly convinced that all religions are man-made, it isn't so clear for others. Our parents, family, and friends might be more inclined to believing in weak and even outright false claims to miracles, there is a social and historical context to their beliefs

4. Many of our parents have faced hardships like racism moving to the West. Some may have had an opportunity to better acclimate into their neighborhoods and jobs

There are probably many more reasons for why people who are theists and deists believe what they do; I'm just trying to identify a few.

Now, but it’s not as simple as that is it. Consisting primarily of individuals in our late teens and those in our twenties, we have to be careful in how we carry ourselves. The reasons for why we do not believe in any of the false logic is because we have been critical and open-minded. Our individual experiences leading to our apostasy may have been very different, but I hope I can say that all of us believe in what we believe in due to openheartedness and reason and not stupidity, ignorance, or foolishness.",Question/Discussion,self,thecount,

It was flu season and touching wasn't allowed for her protection. It was heartbreaking. Her eyes were full of tears. I came close to her bed and looked at her closely

Another 2 months and I got to know what was wrong with her. She got gastric cancer stage 4A. It's not curable. 5 year life expectancy after diagnosis? 4%. four percent. She probably has a year or two of endless torture.

She had a surgery just a while ago. The first few days we had to go to the ER because she was vomiting a lot. My dad asked me to hold her hand while going down the stairs. The moment I remember how weak

One of the reasons I have a burning hatred for Islam is how much of it's dogmatic bullshit is deeply ingained in my pysche after decades of indoctrination. Even after denouncing Islam, beer, hell, even gays and transvestites, which obviously isn't natural since everyone else who isn't a muzzie doesn't have any of these feelings. I fucking hate how much Islam has done almost irreparable damage to my perception of reality down to the core; It's hard to tell whether some of my feelings are my own or the result of indoctrination.

I decided to come out perhaps 2-3 weeks ago, many other parts of my life, parts that I am working my butt off to get back and grow as a (normal) person in.

I'm getting a part-time job sometime very, while still working on my business. However there is a chance I'll put my entrepreneurial dreams on hold and get a full time job soon, as stability right now is most important.

I know I'll be kicked out of my family, till yesterday. 

*Spoiler alert* I watched Brave with a lady friend of mine, and they discover through a forced magical encounter that they have to accept each other's point of view, and the mother lets the girl move on as she wants.

It just felt weird.

Then, ""that's a lot like your situation, right?""

And then it hit me. That woman, *wham* emotion. I'm totally not an emotional guy (something I'm trying to become more of), but this hit me in the gut. And she realised what she said, and was apologetic. But I told her it was fine, I'm glad, I needed to know that feeling. 

Because I'm going to be kicked out

My mom may not find out straight away

Anyways, I can cook, working hard to get ""cleaning"" into my habits, and I throw awesome social gatherings. Would be cool to live in an ex-Moose house ;)

A french friend of mine asked me, why not just live away? The main reason is that I feel that I cannot work on moving the ex-muslim community forward, without coming out. In the UK, the risk is not physical as much as it is psychological. They will try to get to me through my family, especially if I am in the closet. This community has so much fucking potential, and I deeply believe the same about the exMooses' that I've met, and I'm going to make sure we damned well get moving.

I spent the month after posting planning and finalizing details that would give me an easy way to get out if things get bad. I wasn't exactly sure what my parents' reaction would be since I never really rebelled or questioned them before. I knew they wouldn't kick me out

The next night I told them, instead they suddenly stopped and started pleading and crying begging me not to do this and that they love very much. That we would talk and figure it out together. We didn't talk and figure it out, instead I spent a week praying, fasting, and listening to quran day and night until I ""feel better"". They completely ignored the issue, and I was in completely misery and overwhelmed by guilt and the fact that I need to bring it up again.

When I did bring it up again it went very bad. My mother threatened to physically harm herself if I don't pray and do everything she says. I tried to talk to her

1363911726.0,1arote,Miraculous Quran,zackquaid,41,2,35,"Quran is hardly even worthy of serious study
  
PARADOXICAL GOD OF QURAN - Quran assigns many paradoxical superlative attributes to this Allah character. So much so that Quran gallantly claims that Allah is indeed more merciful than your mother, then surely Allah cannot be the Most Merciful. Therefore, since Allah with his vengeful and punishing nature (and many superlative attributes to convey this nature) cannot be the Most Merciful, because greater mercy can be conceived by mere human beings.  
  
NON-EXISTENT THINGS - Quran mentions many non-existent or never existing things, such as Magic, Evil Eye, Jinns, Wall of Dhul Qarnain, Magog, and the magnificent Kingdom of Solomon as real things. The problems with all these things is that should they exist or should they have ever existed then surely we would have had ample evidence of them on Earth. But the state of this world and our history clearly show that these things neither exist nor have they ever existed.  
  
MAGIC - If magic was indeed real, or even for miraculous human good. But indeed there is no evidence in our history or our present of any such use of magic or any magic at all for that matter. Those silly people with no control on their own good and bad fortune that you find sitting on street corners of Eastern Europe or Western Asia are NOT magicians and are not capable of causing any good or ill.  Is that not a fantastic coincidence that this phenomenon is no where to be found for scientific examination?
  
JINNS - If Jinns really existed then surely among them would have risen ambitious leaders like Hitler or Napoleon hellbent on world domination, Muslim Jinns must exist on Earth and it must pain them to see their brothers in faith being kicked around and ridiculed everywhere, and yet they are all busy possessing common psycho patients rather than exposing themselves to a trustworthy media source such as CNN, BBC or Al-Jazeerah to prove that Islam is true once and for all. Is that not a fantastic coincidence that these creatures are no where to be found for scientific examination?  
  
EVIL EYE - The concept of Evil Eye is so ridiculous that one need not say more than to say that if it really truly did exist and possessed any real power then surely collective ""Hasad"" of the backwards Muslim nations and their evil eye upon the well developed European cities would have caused those cities to collapse on their own.  
  
WALL OF DHUL QARNAIN AND MAGOG - Quran gallantly claims that Allah allowed Dhul Qarnain to trap Magog until such day (yet in future) as Allah decides, and yet with the entire world being mapped there is no sign of wall of similar composition nor of these fantastic dwarfs Magog. In fact I do not know what is sadder than the fact that the bimetallic interactions and ensuing reactions would have rendered structure described by Quran very weak or the fact that even with the entire world mapped and hadiths of Mohammed well studied people still believe in him. Neither this wall nor the people behind this wall actually exist nor have they ever existed, and their tale is not found in any historical documents or knowledge of any ancient men except the Christian Romances of Alexander, well known to be a fallacious document and fairly recent at time of Mohammed.  
  
MAGNIFICENT KINGDOM OF SOLOMON - The fact is that there is no archaeological or historical evidence of the so-called Kingdom of Solomon. If such a great kingdom did actually exist then surely neighboring nations and their writings would have known and mentioned them

So what miraculous Quran have you been reading when once scrutinized this book cannot even stand simple rational tests. There is nothing in the Quran worthy of being taken seriously. Even the legal framework proposed by Allah is flawed in that it depends on count of witnesses as strength of evidence against a person rather than quality of witnesses. It demands a minimum number of witnesses for a lot of things, the problem that this book DOES NOT OUTLAW slavery but encourages sex with sex slaves as explicitly mentioning it as permissible is another strike against this book.

~~A little bit of the background. I did my bachelors in Australia

~~I knew the relationship was going to come with an expiry date (my graduation date) because my family would never accept her and I refuse to abandon my family especially since soon I was going to be the sole breadwinner. I was honest about this to her and she was alright with it. We kept it secret from my family. Fast forward to about 3 years and we are still together and going stronger than ever.~~

~~Throughout

~~About a couple of months ago, the rape laws, the blashphemy and apostasy laws, but I always thought that Islam was a source of good (I am quite ashamed of this now) and Muslims were to blame. But I just couldn't satisfy the person inside me with the answers the scholars provided. I then researched sexuality in Islam and I was blown away by how raw a deal women get. I mean I knew Aisha was 9 when she got married but it didn't click until just then and I was absolutely horrified and felt sick. I had been drifting away over the years and it seemed logical to cut the chord.~~

~~It came at a time when I am actually home with my family. They, it is better not to talk about such things. At about this time my mother started pressing me if there were any girls I was interested in, in Australia.~~

~~I should have known then that it was a trap and that she meant Muslim Pakistani girls but I am a stupid person and I took her at her word that she was interested in my life and my choice and had come around from labeling all non-Muslim women as women who slept with everyone and were never faithful to their husbands. Oh how stupid I truly was and how I regret that now. I was so desperate to talk to the people I loved about the one I loved.~~

~~She listened intently

~~My mother advised me to keep my options open and not settle just yet and that she will show me some girls as well. I agreed because this was a colossal compromise on her part. We agreed that I should look to finally settle down in 3 years and no sooner and just focus on my career right now. I wholeheartedly agreed because I was glad to finally be able to talk to my parents

~~Later the same day

~~The countless hours I have slaved

~~Its been some time since the conversation and I have been pretty depressed since. I have been riding a high for a very long time and this is one of the lowest I have gotten since I was contemplating suicide. Despite what she said

~~I have learned my lesson and will never tell them anything meaningful about my life again. I am quite shaken up but I will persevere on. I have lost all motivation and it will take a lot to refocus and continue on but people have been through worse.

i myself became an atheist before becoming non-muslim

* people of those ages were readily accepting of people claiming to be prophet and muhammed wasnt alone in his time to do this.

* he was a 'good' man from what muslim sources say of his first 40 years

* he has an experience in the cave of hira

* other people convinced him he was a prophet rather than coming to realisation himself (e.g. khadija

* he preached his message to the arabs for maybe 10 years without anyone killing him for it

* this religion was a monotheistic religion of the christians and jews of that area

* not many people converted as they had all heard the same stories before from others claiming similar things

* Muhammed was then sought by the Yatrib tribes as arbitrator between them especially the pagan awz and khazraj and the jewish tribes

* Now started the second phase of Islam, Umar, Ali etc... But I reckon they were greatley influential in its evolution. 

* Muhammed wasnt a dictator rather saw wht his followers wanted i.e. money land property(women) etc... So he gave them God's permission to do e.g. Caravan raids etc... His way of kinda revenge from all who rejected him

* Now obviously as a man he had his desires so he had what he could get e.g. aisha

* Most of his immediate companions USED HIM to get wht they wanted i.e. wealth

* Muslims like to say muhammeds word was final etc... And basicaly he made the laws while others followed but the truth is different, but a man was brought to him who he wanted killed yet was spared because Uthman pleaded on his behalf, Muhammed kept quiet when asked, showing that he was in two minds, i forget the name and what it said after but it was to the effect that idnthey respected Muhammed they would have killed this man without him saying.

Also remember as soon as muhammed died

* Islam survived because it united the arab tribes so instead of fighting each other they could attack and conquer and plunder other lands around them

If you're a Muslim and you don't impose your beliefs on others but defend Islam when a fellow Muslim does wrong in its name - that's understandable. Disappointing but understandable.


If you're a Muslim and you're reading this- be aware that there are those who strongly disagree with your religion- not just its morality but its veracity.

Now that you are aware that there are questions regarding Islam's veracity and morality

A. You can ignore these questions.

B. You can dismiss these questions outright.

C. You can research these questions and conclude that Islam is still as good and  perfect as you always believed it to be.

D. You can research these questions and conclude that Islam isn't as good and perfect as you always believed it to be.

If the latter is what happens

E. Continue to condone

F. Quit Islam.

So, straight up, what she did with my belongings. She said she immediately threw them out when she found them.

Now, it's called the lifelike dong. It looks like a real penis. Anyway, I told her she had no control over what I do with my body and that I was angry that she threw out my belongings, especially considering it cost me money. 

She asked why I couldn't ""finish myself"" only using fingers. She didn't know if it was normal that girls have toys and the rest. She then kept grilling me that I must have already lost my virginity if I was using a toy. I lied and said I hadn't lost it to anyone. I had to explain to her how the hymen works, etc. 

My mother, I'd be too big, etc. It's actually pretty normal sized.

The pipe, she was very concerned about. I vehemently denied smoking or smoking weed (especially since I finished smoking it when I went away for the weekend). I asked her when I ever came home drunk, high, or smelling like cigarettes. She said never.  I told her I found these things and she said she didn't believe me because it was everywhere in my room. She got me there. 

She asked me to stop smoking or whatever it was that I was doing. She genuinely believes smoking weed makes you ""insane"" and marijuana will lure me into committing criminal acts. I told her many people smoke it

For a whole hour after this, so, I can't really explain to her the situation.

She stressed that I marry an Afghan, get engaged and move on with my life. She wants to meet my boyfriend, which doesn't exist since I'm just seeing someone, so she can give the okay to marry.

She keeps asking me to get my masters and marry, owe over 40k in student loans and I'm 22. 

I was actually pretty scared but it appears my mom is more scared. It's clear she's trying to be on her best behavior, etc. I tried bonding with her afterwards and she seemed happy. She's been on good terms with me the past couple of days. 

Anyway

Thanks again for the help and the support.

Wow I find this [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/120scj/i_dont_like_converts_to_islam/) pretty goddamn offensive myself being a western convert. Unfortunately though

 To give some background my parents are west African descent. My father is Muslim and my mom is Christian. I was born and raised in California. I was never exposed to Islam because my dad never spoke about it

I grew up being exposed to Christianity because that's what everyone else was. I was never religious until I turned 18 and hit rock bottom. When I hit rock bottom in life in many different ways I had some experiences and ""found God"". I thought I had to follow a religion so I researched Christianity and Islam. The Trinity, original sin, atonement, and other whacky ideas of Christianity seemed ridiculous to me so I leaned toward Islam. 

After buying a Qur'an I was duped easily. I was in need of guidance and it offered me a lot of things spiritually. For someone on rock bottom, peace, morality, and relief from a negative lifestyle and at that point in my life I thought I needed religion to be a good person. I started reading the Qur'an and ate it all up. I quickly read the Qur'an and started researching Islamic principles and theology online. I read countless books in my school library about Islamic fiqh, sufism, and history. I must have read 2 books every week from biographies on Muhammad's life to sufi meditation practices.

I started learning Islam terms and started dressing more moderately. I quit drinking and smoking for months at a time though I would momentarily relapse and repent. I began to see evil in everything my friends did. I believed in angels and jinn and did my best to strengthen myself in my faith by constantly invoking the name of Allah throughout the day in everything I did. I truly lived in fear of hell. I called myself FaithfulJinn online because I knew I was going to go to hell regardless of my faith. I was a devil but I was a devil who believed. I began learning prayers in Arabic

I would debate tirelessly online in favor of Islam and felt like I needed to defend it and advocate it online. I gained a deep understanding of the Qur'an because I would study it every single evening and then argue with both Christians

After about a year of solidifying myself in the faith I started to feel alienated in my faith. I felt different than the other Muslims at the school. The Arabs/Persians all had their own little groups, and halfway between being the hard-partying pothead I used to be.

Anyway as I became more knowledgeable of Islam and had a pretty decent grasp of Qur'an and Islamic theology I started looking into the Sunnah and this is when I first rebelled against Islam. I thought the Sunnah of the prophet was not divine at all and that it was full of absurd bullshit. This was my first deviation. I became a Qur'an alone/Qur'anist Muslim soon after I started studying hadith. Because of this I was further alienated from any of the Muslims of my age group because they were all Sunni Arabs. It was bad enough I was black but to reject the hadith? Yeah right.

In my second year of practicing Islam I joined the U.S. military. For me it was out of necessity but it was also a sort of personal jihad against extremism. I would restore Islam's name by showing that Muslims can work toward good while at the same time fighting against extremists. I prayed to Allah that if I got sent to Iraq or Afghanistan and was struck by an IED that he would kill me instead of losing a limb. When I joined the military I became even stronger in my faith because a lot of the people around me and the culture in general were bigoted against Islam so I felt a bit persecuted and as alone as ever.

When I got back home from almost a year of military training it became hard to get back into Islam. Even when I was on active duty I still prayed almost every single prayer and I studied Qur'an a lot. I had nothing better to do with my free time than to pray

I would feel guilty every single day but I still believed strongly in Allah. I just couldn't bring myself to continue with the rituals. After a few months of this I started doubting if God was real at all. I still invoked his name constantly and believed but I felt like the conversation was one way. I would try to read the Qur'an like I used to but the verses offered less and less consolation and guidance. The Qur'an no longer seemed as magical as it used to. On the internet I became exposed to atheist arguments and they made me angry. I hated atheism. It scared me and shook me to the core to think Allah wasn't real and I was wrong. I wondered why I was such a bad Muslim and couldn't practice like I used to. The seeds of doubt had been planted but I didn't know it yet.

I eventually gained the courage to question my own beliefs. I was confused as to why I couldn't see God in my life anymore and why God didn't answer my prayers. Eventually came across a video on youtube from ""strangestdude"". It was called ""Why I'm Not a Muslim"" and he explained why he left Islam. It was the first time I saw an ex-Muslim argue against Islam and he calmly and reasonably explained everything. From that day I was shook. I worked graveyard shift by myself at work, the nature of life, arguments for and against God, and if my beliefs were really founded in anything. It was the first time I TRULY entertained the idea that maybe God wasn't real. 

I decided to study the Qur'an objectively and look for inconsistencies and contradictions and immorality. It was the first time I read the Qur'an from the objective and skeptical perspective instead of the apologetic perspective. After a few weeks of this I wavered back and forth between disbelief and belief. Eventually I concluded that the Qur'an was not in fact the word of God or any divine being. It was the words, and I had spent the last 3 years of my life trying to appease this book. I had come out to my family and friends as a Muslim and totally changed myself because I believed it was true. I was so humiliated and devastated and disillusioned and hurt at first. Everything I had thought and hoped and prayed for was wrong. Everything I did was in vain and all the pain I had suffered through while thinking that Allah was closer to me than my jugular vein was actually suffered alone. 

I had felt so much guilt and denied myself so much pleasure and joy and totally changed my lifestyle based on a lie. I had tattooed my body with religious tattoos (I have praying hands with the crescent moon and star

I very quickly became an agnostic atheist after this. I'm not bitter toward my years as a Muslim or even my religious tattoos that I began getting before and during my conversion. To be honest my tattoos still look badass and tell a story of my faith. I'm not bitter that my time as a Muslim helped me find myself and see the world in a different way

This was a long post so I'm also going to make my own thread on the page in case people don't see it in this relatively large one. I didn't expect it to get so long but I wanted to tell my story as best as I could. Hopefully it didn't hop around all over the place too much and was coherent enough to read because I know it was all a wall of text. If you read the entire thing then I both thank you and at the same time I apologize for putting you through that.",self,t5_2s7k2,1351131270.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/121js0/the_story_of_an_american_convert_to_islam/

*The question isn't directed at those among us

That being said

_______________________________
It's not easy bringing about change when:

* When you can't come out in the open for fear of ostracism

* When you lack the numbers


However even on a tiny subreddit like this

Off the top of my head (DB is offline currently- **please forgive any omissions or errors**)

* AgentLiquid- founded this subreddit. Got things going.

* akuma87- did a lot of the initial posts regarding the hadith and quran- compiled over at /r/qurans and /r/hadith. Currently rumored to be fighting the good fight over at his homeworld.

* Ash09- responsible for the behind-the-scenes technical stuff for the subreddit. Hopefully will return June 2013.

* Big_Brain- Promotes a critical and rational method of discussion. Crazy enough to subject himself to reading up on the Quran

* scumbag_humanist founded /r/exmuslimdating (not just for dating!) The meetups over in the UK and Canada were a result of this subreddit.

* Meenakustard &amp; Improvaganza- organised the UK meetups. The most tangible impact thus far.

* tentativetuna- organised the Canada meetup. How aboot that...

* Girl7 - came up with the idea of the [online chat group](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslimdating/comments/uik9q/a_solution_to_the_chat_issue_what_do_you_think/).

* zulaikha_idris - ~~throat punching violent extremists~~. Created a post over at /r/atheism that briefly shifted their focus to Islam (aka the post that launched a thousand memes).

* Nod_Flanders - [gave a shoutout to /r/exmuslim from the site of the Kaabah itself!](http://i.imgur.com/K1UdU.jpg) ~~Stupid~~ Awesome Flanders.

* cfdlabs - *old man who set up the auto-feed on r/exmuslim's twitter account*. Also trying to raise his kids right- a commitment for life!

* fylow - designed the current logo and look  of the subreddit.

* lalib - mod over at /r/progressive_islam. ~~Working to destroy the enemy from within~~ Working with what might be our best allies.

* ryua - a contributor over at Skepchick. Currently in the process of writing a book: [A Skeptic's Guide to Islam](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/skepticsguidetoislam/a-skeptics-guide-to-islam). 

Special mentions:

* balqisfromkuwait - a Muslim who will soon release a book about Islam. Talks of an Islam where apostasy is not a crime punishable by death- among other ideas. 

* Taqwacore - mod over at /r/progressive_islam. An Islamic subreddit that is more open to discussion.

*Not all the people mentioned above are members of /r/exmuslim. I also don't necessarily agree with all of those mentioned or their actions.*

*There are probably many I forgot to mention. I have also unfairly summarised achievements (based off my perception) in a sentence or two.*

I was sitting with my mom while she was watching ""Zindagi Gulzar Hay"" (Pakistani TV Show) and I noticed the main character in the show was pretty conservative. He said something like ""men should be the dominant gender in a relationship"" and I told mom I disagreed with it. She said gender roles are very well defined in Islam and that's what the guy in the drama is doing. I asked her if Mo and Allah really did a good job at defining gender roles and if she was cool with men being allowed to beat up women. She said that isn't true and Islam does not condone violence towards women. I said it's in the Quran and showed her verse 4:34 which clearly states men are allowed to strike women. She still was not satisfied and said maybe the actual meaning is different and how I should not draw conclusions without knowing the actual meaning behind it. She said I should talk to Muslim scholars and get my answers from them. I told her that won't really be helpful because their answers will be biased and the only way to view in a neutral manner was by reading the translation and hadiths. She agreed with me on that.

Then the topic changed to science in Quran. I told her she was wrong again and gave the embryology example. I told her any parent would be able to tell how a baby is born because whatever is in the Quran is what anyone in that era could have observed. I told her hadiths on the solar system, uh, complete than the other religions, but that doesn't make it a perfect religion. It does not even provide any evidence on the existence of a God.

After talking about scientific inaccuracies in the Quran we talked about the contradictions in Quran and she said that was because Quran wasn't written in a day. I asked her if God really was the creator it would know the future would be like and could have avoided those contradictions. Let's assume Quran was written in the span of a century

The conversation went on for three hours. She did tear up when I told her I did not believe in an afterlife and it is harder for me because this is all I got and I have got to live it to the fullest with her by my side. We talked about kids and I told her if I have kids she can tell them about Islam as long as she keeps it neutral and doesn't force it on them (I do not plan to move out after marriage). The kids should be allowed to decide what they want to believe in.

Then we talked about namaz and she asked me to pray for her even tho I don't believe in it. I told her it was fine as long as she knows I am only doing it for her and I don't think there is any sawab for either of us because there is no God according to my views. She said that was fine.

After the conversation ended

I am glad she did not overreact over my beliefs and listened to my arguments like an adult. I did cut down a lot to keep the post short so if there is anything in particular you want to ask,False,self,t5_2s7k2,False,,,t3_1c1ed2

While talking to a friend

Being a Muslim girl and growing up with my family, I stopped. Hanging out with people became some mental baggage that I didn't want to deal with. And while I've always gotten my energy from being alone (the key to introvertedness) I'm also natural around people. Had I been given a chance to socialize freely, I believe I may have been molded into someone much less introspective and pensive. And even more extremely, I believe liberated socialization would have prevented my apostasy.

""Wait, even amongst children, was the norm? Even in the most non-sexual nature. Like aboriginals,"" I say.

""No, ""Nudity is always sexual.""

""What did humans do before they had clothes?"" I ask.

""Well

""If we were to avoid nudity

""What? Are you implying that a nude woman deserves to be raped?""

""No no no! I did not say that

""Well

By then, yes she's right. 

The dude puffs his dainty chest out puts out his finger

At this point

The dainty guy I was debating

""It's in the Quran

I'm then reminded that these guys think I'm some white chick.

The guy beside me says, ask her. She can explain it to you. Don't you feel uncomfortable praying with men?""

""Don't drag her into this. If she wants to talk

The girl laughed about it.

""Uhh... Well,"" she says, looking at me. 

""But the thing is though that they are moving around in a circular motion, ""they aren't standing still together to be distracted. Since you are in perpetual motion, there won't be the chance for distraction. So, I guess you're not really praying together, side by side.""

""But here though

I actually couldn't help smiling the entire time.

Oh man,"" he says, flippping the pages like a flip book.

The dude who pushed the hijabi girl into the debate noted that the details for praying are in the hadiths. 

""Right

The scrawny dude I began the debate withjumps in.

""I don't think I answered this for you. I did not answer this well because you have the look of unsatisfaction. Where are you going to class? He says.

I say

""Oh!"" He pumps his fist down

""I've seen them before. Anyway

I step away when he tells me to wait.

""Would you like to take some of this literature with you?""

I come back and lean over the table

""Oh

The dudes and the people around me smile.

""Wow

Again, maybe catholic girl read the quran and some hadith - like when Muslims invite white people over to break fast during Ramadan. They get all giddy and proud.

I look at the quran and say

They all get this sunken look on their faces.

""Well

1343985213.0,xm2y2,"Some scientific evidence, experiments, and theories/principles that every atheist should know",wazzym,44,14

[The Miller-Urey Experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller-Urey_experiment) - Replicating earth's atmosphere during when life was first thought to have formed

[The long term e. coli bacteria experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._coli_long-term_evolution_experiment) - shows that drastic changes in physiology are very much possible. The ability to process citrate as opposed to undigested nutrients is a huge step. The diversity of life and the faux concept of ""macroevolution"" don't require God.

[The Omo Remains](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omo_remains) - At 200, but beyond that, they also have several anthromorpholical traits that tie them to our predecessor [homo heidelbergensis.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_heidelbergensis) God was not only not necessary to create man, he just plain didn't.

[The evolution of morality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_morality) - This, chimps, wolves, vampire bats, etc.) shows that animals feel compelled to help one another, reciprocate good/bad deeds, be monogamous

[The first law of thermodynamics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_law_of_thermodynamics) I've never said that God couldn't create energy/matter if he existed, only rearranged. The big bang theory is specifically an explanation of how the pre-universe conditions developed into an expanding universe. Until the first law is reconciled with it in some way, it is by no means the beginning of existence (but a good explanation of the big bang and pre-big bang conditions is [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ImvlS8PLIo&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=2486s) You don't need a God to explain the origins of the universe, and there's no reason to think existence ever was created

[The Chaos Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory) - It's a retort for ""complexity denotes creation"". Everything is infinitely complex

[Heat Death](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe) - Theists quite often argue that the universe is too ""fine tuned"". The degeneration of everything into heat is the best example of how this universe is NOT fine tuned. That the sun will expand into a red giant and swallow the earth, and the occasional meteor. It's not fine tuned for humans, it's 2/3 salt water that we naturally can neither drink nor live in, it's filled with animals that would eat us given the opportunity, which is not to mention viruses, bacteria, and GOD AWFUL [parasites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina_worm) The universe isn't fine tuned to our lives. You don't need a God to do something that didn't happen.

[The God Helmet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_helmet) - Theists often use experiential ""evidence"" to claim that God is proven by spirtual experiences. [Psilocybin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin#Mystical_experiences) does the same thing as the god helmet and shows that it doesn't take a God to make that kind of experience.

It's quite common for men refer to women who dress scantily an sleep around or promiscuous using demeaning names like 'whores' or 'sluts' or 'cheap'.

Now, really, want to have sex with women. In fact, they don't even have to be pretty; as long as she's not too fat or too ugly, any guy would be content with her.

Now, then why in fuck's name do men treat sexually active/promiscuous women so badly? Why is it that men mock them and demean them and shame them when THEY ARE EXACTLY THE KIND OF WOMEN THAT FULFILL THEIR DESIRES?! 

And not only that, we prize and respect celibate women more than the promiscuous ones.

Seriously, the more she is respected. Instead of calling them 'whores' or 'sluts', we could have called them 'goddess' or 'princess' or 'maiden' or whatever. Imagine a world where, instead of hiding their sexual activities out of shame, women would brag to everyone about how many men they've slept with. Imagine a world where sexual activities would be such a social normality as shaking hands or patting in the back.

1. Punishment and Reward: Children's behaviors are dictated by a rigid, Level I] (http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/genpsymoraldev.html) and [Piaget’s theory of cognitive development, Preoperational stage] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piaget's_theory_of_cognitive_development#.28Pre.29Operatory_Thought).) Quranic law dictates the same. It makes no clarifications about extenuating circumstances, much as a child who has no understanding about the larger word wouldn’t. A woman *has* to cover herself from head to toe regardless of climatic, cultural, professional or whatever factors. A man *must*....(Ok, I got stuck here. Couldn’t think of anything a man is obligated to do.)

2. The Power of Numbers: Children make up arbitrary rules when they play or argue. You have to count to 12 before you can open your eyes when playing hide and seek. Same with rituals in Islam. There is no reasoning behind odd numbers (3, simple maths. Praying alone is rewarding, praying with x number of people is x times rewarding.

3. Methods of Problem-solving: The answer is beating. Or stoning. Or death. Children scratch, a man should beat his wife (‘lightly’) if she disobeys him. If his children do not start praying by the age of 7, they shouuld also be beaten (‘lightly’). Never have I come across a Hadith or passage in the Quran that advises each party to sit down and have a logical and articulate discussion about their issues.

I'm not a psychologist or theologian by any stretch of the word, and I’m trying to stay relative here, but this is essentially what it is. All religions are primitive because they appeal to the helpless, childlike, nature within. Some of us move beyond this, past it, and others cling to it stronger.

If you didn't already know

I'm getting so fed up with having to PRETEND. Once upon a time I put in a real effort to make it look like I was ""devout""; lately though, I don't know.

Maybe before I was 18 I didn't mind changing my clothes as soon as I got out of the house

A little while ago my mom and I got into the topic of people moving away from home and she nearly flipped on the subject of ""GIRLS DO NOT MOVE AWAY FROM HOME UNTIL THEY'RE MARRIED THAT'S NOT HOW WE LIVE A GIRL LIVES WITH HER PARENTS"" when I mentioned how many girls give up amazing career opportunities in different cities/provinces simply because they need to stay with their families in Deadmonton while the males can travel and do whatever the hell they want. 

The past few months have been really hard for multiple personal reasons and I've been having a rough time. I started smoking (bad habit

What's been stressing me is when my mom gave me this ridiculous speech: (paraphrased) **""A girl holds her entire family's honor; if one of your brothers does something [she means like, look how many people you're bringing down with you (referring to my brothers and parents)"".** Great. So now I have to sacrifice my own happiness so their ""image"" remains intact to the community? 

(she found out my 2nd oldest brother used to drink quite a bit and was pissed but definitely didn't kill him like she would me. **Irony**: this is the same brother that used to flip at his younger siblings because they weren't religious enough. Sevenish years ago he had a brain aneurysm because I listened to the black eyed peas....while he was drinking his face off and having casual sex. The hypocrisy burns)

I just feel so much unwanted pressure. I can't go out anywhere without my mom constantly blowing up my phone. It's annoying, apparently) at any time of the day and it's no big deal. If I even bring this up she goes into that whole spiel about how **boys and girls are different we care about girls blah blah blah**.

I want to move out **SO. BAD.** I always figured I'd just suck it up till I was done my schooling (approx. 4-5 more years) but I don't see how that's even possible. I don't even know IF I'm going to last this Ramadan. 

I guess when it comes down to it
I WANT to stay out past 9 without anybody killing my phone when I'm in the middle of dinner with my friends. I WANT to be able to leave the house in jeans and a t shirt and not be freaked out on. When I'm interested in a guy and he's interested in me
I'm tired of constantly being called to pray with some of my family members. I don't want to hear these female vs male roles speeches anymore. I want to travel. I want to (and am going to be) independent.

The only thing that's really keeping me sane is knowing I have five figures saved up (started saving in grade nine) that makes a nice safety net of sorts. But I'm the type that stresses over everything.

At times (especially when I'm a little bit tipsy) I just want to go up to my mom and say ""listen

I know this all sounds so superficial but it's been bugging me so much. I want to leave SO BAD but I don't want to deal with the impeding shit storm. I just needed to get that off my chest.

1348694795.0,10j0vk,Holy f**king hell... More stories from my Philosophy of Religion Class. Sunni girl claims that extremist violence only comes from Shi'ites.,FaithfulJinn,39,7,16,"Okay I made a post about my Philosophy of Religion class a few days ago but I felt this deserved its own post. I'll post my deconversion story in my original post a little later I've been meaning to get around to it for those who asked in that topic.

Anyway onto what made me want to facepalm my fucking head through a wall when I was in class today. Like I said in my other post we've been discussing Islam in my class for the past couple class sessions. Today the teacher brought up violence in Islam and how the Qur'an often preaches peace but also encourages violence at some points and he mentioned how the verses which promise Paradise for martyrs could be seen as an encouragement for suicide bombing. 

One of the Sunni girls in the back of the class had the ignorance and the audacity to raise her hand and say this.

""Excuse me professor? You know how you were talking about suicide bombers and violence? I think that's mainly the Shi'ites who do that. Sunnis wouldn't do that.""

HOLY F***ING HELL I wanted to put my head through a wall when she said that. WTF?! Thankfully the professor put her in her place. He said

""You're a Sunni aren't you?"" and just stopped there and the whole class laughed. Then he explained more.

""I know most people want to defend their beliefs and blame the other guys but you're wrong. These verses are right here in YOUR Qur'an it's not just Shi'ites. Look at Palestine and the Middle East there are Sunni and Shi'ite suicide bombers. You're just wrong in saying that.""

It was a little nicer than how I would have said it but he got his point across firmly. I would have explained 9/11 and how they were mainly Saudi with a smattering of Egyptians and an odd Jordanian/Lebanese and how Sunnis are fighting in Iraq, Nigeria, Somalia, etc.  I would have gone on to explain how since most Muslims are Sunni, that a majority of a suicide bombers by sheer probability are probably Sunni! I was so fucking dumbstruck that an adult in college with western education would say something so fucking stupid and wrong. This girl really had the audacity and the ignorance to make a statement like this?!

The way she tried to attribute violence in Islam and violent verses to Shi'ites make me think she's never opened a fucking newspaper let alone the Qur'an. If she had done either even once in her life she never would have said something so fucking stupid. I highly suspect I know more about Islam and the Qur'an than any of the Muslim females in my class. I studied that book fervently and researched many Islamic subjects because that's just the kind of person I am when it comes to philosophy and faith. These girls probably just throw on a hijab

That just pissed me the fuck off today how someone could say something so stupid I was truly disturbed that a grown and western educated adult could really be that ignorant.

 I was literally insulted by her ignorance.

7) Witnessing the overall treatment of women in the faith

First

In Islam there is a concept known as [Radāʿ (رضاع)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rada_%28fiqh%29)

We need to take every lactating woman in Saudi Arabia, mix it, and then make some droplets and invite every adult in Saudi Arabia to put a droplet on their tongue. This way, **everyone** in Saudi Arabia will be *mahram* to each other, meaning nobody in Saudi Arabia will have to veil!

And the side effect of this is that Saudis won't be able to marry each other. Well one solution is to simply encourage Saudis to marry Yemenis or Iraqis or Syrians or Gulf Arabs. Another solution would simply be to have the milk collection only be for each town in Saudi Arabia, but they would have to veil to go to a different town.

This is completely within the bounds of Islam

But why limit it to Saudi Arabia? Eventually we can develop a large enough infrastructure and bureaucracy to where we can do this to the *entire Muslim world*. Then, which you have to drink to enter.

This is the way we can adapt Islam to the 21st century

And obviously of course the breast milk will be screened to make sure that no diseases or illness gets transmitted.

Though this only works if rada would apply if you drink it secondarily (i.e. not straight from the breast). If that's the case

Why would he make a book only in Arabic? The Chinese had a sophisticated culture, would only see the words from their language, in a way that they would understand God's message perfectly? Allah supposedly sent down previous revelations: the Torah, Zabur, Injil, Scrolls of Abraham, Kitab of Yahya and the Scrolls of Moses. Does that mean it took Allah multiple times to finally get it right? Does he not learn from his mistakes? He couldn't just make the Torah incorruptible in the first place? Isn't he the All-Knower?

I somehow built up the courage to share something that I haven't with anyone before. I started off asking questions if he ever questioned his belief/faith and why he was a Muslim. After a while of discussing things he became very frustrated that I was challenging him. He's usually open minded about things, ""Wth do you mean you don't believe in religion, are you fucking kidding me"". I tried explaining my side of things and the reasons of why so. He sat there quietly hearing what I had to say, but never listened. His exact words were, ""Are you sure you're not getting mind fucked by the shit you're reading"", this hurt me terribly. I tried to reason with him once more, but he wasn't having it. I dropped the subject and he basically demanded that I don't tell my parents of this crazy belief I had. After that I was too afraid of his reaction about coming out and saying that I didn't believe in God.

After that conversation I left and went out with my friends

I know the principle behind a hijab is to protect a female’s modesty. Fine. But the REASONS religious leaders would give for this always shouted one thing at me: all men are perverts. 

This always makes me angry and it also brings up a couple of very interesting points. Firstly

As a male

Now, “wow, she looks good.” But that doesn’t imply a perverse mind. I don’t get an uncontrollable urge to have sex. It’s perfectly natural for guys to notice girls and vice versa.

And that brings up the second point. It’s PERFECTLY NATURAL. According to religion, god commands us to turn away from such things. 

Doesn’t that imply an imperfect god? First he creates such an attraction

And then the religious would argue, why oh why would the Creator of the universe, a being so powerful that he can control every event in creation, WANT to test us?

I went out and changed door knob to one that I can lock to recently and I get flak for that. I get emotionally blackmailed for not fasting or praying. I simply cannot live in this toxic environment any longer. I have a completely different lifestyle that conflicts with living with my family (I smoke and drink once a week or every other week)

My situation is this. I JUST graduated from engineering at a major North American city so my job prospects are not too bad. However, a floor to sleep, internet, showers, microwave, and a coffeepot. I have this place until end of August and after that, I will probably have to find a friend's place to crash or a shelter unless I can afford an apartment by then. It's come to the point where this seems like a very good option than living at home. I plan on applying everyday by using my network to my full potential (btw, PM me). My friend said he can hook me up with a part time job at a grocery store but I am going to remain cautiously optimistic with that

I'm going to tell them I am not a muslim and reject everything in Islam and as a result

The type of advice I'm looking for I guess is what to expect. I know it's all relative and unique experiences but are there certain traps I shouldn't fall under. Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? Anyone know how to eat healthy and cheap given my circumstances of only having access to a coffee mug

**EDIT:** I've read over every post and after having some time to myself and to cool off, make some breakfast, make a packed lunch, leave to campus or a library and spend the bulk of my day applying to jobs or keeping myself productively busy until I get sleepy and head home. Even been applying retail jobs (ugh) to at least start saving up some more money. I really don't know what I was thinking, this is the first summer I'm not working full-time. I guess a part of me really wanted to just enjoy this last bit of freedom I have in my youth before taking a career but it's really been shitty so far because of this household. 

I honestly think avoiding all confrontation is the only thing keeping me from losing my shit and leaving here. This is not a very comfortable lifestyle and it gets lonely. It feels like I'm in school again except lonelier but thankfully I have a few friends that love having me over from time to time. I've tried my best reasoning with them multiple times before this and I consider myself very level-headed but I've concluded there really is no getting through with them.

My boyfriend and I are both 21. I'm white, since he still has a year or two left in school. 

I am okay with being a secret for now. His dad is footing the bill for his education, to a fantastic Mexican woman, who I have met and totally adore. She knows about us and isn't going to tell her ex husband. After they divorced, he married within his race and religion and had a few more kids. 

I just don't get how his dad can be so passionate about the issue when he initially dated and married an ""unsuitable"" woman? Why does my boyfriend have to hide me and suffer through this family turmoil when his dad did the same thing? Maybe he just hopes for better for his son?

My boyfriend drinks, but this doesn't effect our relationship whatsoever. I'm hoping, and I realize that this is a bit selfish, that he eventually leaves the religion altogether. I don't want to raise our children Muslim. But I would do anything to make our future family happen. And if that is what it took, I would. 

Another thing about the arranged marriage, but that's why I'm here. Just looking for insight into the situation.

I love him, but now isn't the time. I guess I'm ranting a bit now. But in the meantime, while I wait, how can I make him feel better about this? I know he hates keeping me a secret. I know he can't stand the idea of disappointing his family. But if his father hasn't disappointed his family by initially marrying his mother, he wouldn't even be here today! It just drives me nuts how his dad can preach all of this and push a lifestyle that he went against so many years ago as well.

The first seven are enumerated by Martha Nussbaum and the last three by Rae Langton.

1. instrumentality: the treatment of a person as a tool for the objectifier's purposes;

2. denial of autonomy: the treatment of a person as lacking in autonomy and self-determination;

3. inertness: the treatment of a person as lacking in agency

4. fungibility: the treatment of a person as interchangeable with other objects;

5. violability: the treatment of a person as lacking in boundary-integrity;

6. ownership: the treatment of a person as something that is owned by another (can be bought or sold);

7. denial of subjectivity: the treatment of a person as something whose experiences and feelings (if any) need not be taken into account.

8. reduction to body: the treatment of a person as identified with their body

9. reduction to appearance: the treatment of a person primarily in terms of how they look

10. silencing: the treatment of a person as if they are silent

Now let's look at how the way that Islam is commonly practiced and understood actually involves all 10.

1. ""Your wives are a place of sowing of seed for you

2. Women are expected to obey their husbands.  They are not able to make their own decisions about their lives.

3. Women are expected to stay at home

4. Men are allowed to have multiple wives whom he is expected to treat equally.  He goes from wife to wife

5. Martial rape does not exist according to Muslim jurists.  Husbands can have sex with their wives whenever they want

6. Men are seen as the guardians and maintainers of women

7. Male scholars

8. Women are primarily seen as reproducers and sex objects.  There is a complete lack of female opinions in mainstream Islam. 

9. Women are forced to obey strict Islamic dress codes.  Women who do not dress in a specific way are judged harshly and all sorts of assumptions are made about their level of faith.  

10. A woman's voice is considered awrah.  It is inappropriate for her to speak in many contexts. ",self,t5_2s7k2,False,discussion,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/18ubno/islam_and_the_sexual_objectification_of_women/

A 19-year-old Muslim girl who has been born and raised in the USA whose parents are from a Muslim-majority country is currently hiding out in my house because her family attempted to send her back to their home country to be forced into a marriage.

My family has known her family for many years and this girl and I used to attend a public school together when we were younger.  Her family approached her about getting married and initially accepted her refusal to marry a person she had never met and to be sent back to their home country, my own family is out of town right now and I have the house to myself and am able to let her stay here.  However, while my own family would never force anyone into a marriage or ship them off to another country like this, I would not have any of their support to get involved in another family's affairs in this way (especially since it's their daughter) and they would probably return this girl to her family.

What should my next steps be?  This girl was never allowed to get a driver's license, so she does not have many resources to utilize.  Thankfully, since I've worked for organizations that aid young people in abusive households (or who are otherwise disadvantaged) before, I have access to a local women's shelter that I can get her into before my family returns home.  However, that won't provide a permanent solution and there are also the many dangers that will arise once her family finds out that she hasn't gone to their home country and likely files a missing person report.  Should I work on trying to file restraining orders against her family now while I try and figure out new living arrangements for her?  

I have only five days before my own family returns home, her safety will be at very high risk once they find out that she's done this.

I debated weather I should write to you anymore or not. Your emails were hurtful and unbelievable. You said you don't feel safe and comfortable to see me because I told you that I will pin you down but did I do that ever to you ? I said that in a desperate attempt to stop you from what you did and to try to protect you. I know I can't protect you from yourself. The choices you have made has made life unbearable for me but the selfishness you have shown
Religion is just an excuse for you because no religion would approve of your choices. You once said to me that anything is possible even that you could live forever. Well
I wish I could say that I don't care about you but that is not true. I can't help but to love you because I gave birth to you. I am sorry I trusted you too much and believed what you kept telling me and could not see what you were up to. I saw you as my best child, smart but it turned out as just an act. You acted until you did not have to. It is girls like you, that people are afraid to have daughters. You took away my ability to trust my children. Alena is trying hard but I just can't see her as any different then you. I see people caring for their children and all I could think of is what they will do to their parents when they are older.

I didn't know how else to get around the 10

**TL;DR** I plan to give my parents the ‘all-tomato’ tonight that I am NOT a Muslim and they should not expect me to participate in any form of religious activities. I have no intention of praying. I do not want to deprive myself of water for 16 hours


**[UPDATE]** I have had the strangest day ever! But before I start explaining

But first, my mom came home. At this point, I had unlocked my door because one of my bros wanted to grab something from my room and I didn't bother locking the room after he left. I was programming for work-related stuff. My mom always makes tea for herself, my father and I. She came in and asked me if I wanted some, and I politely refused. I was pretty sure my dad had told my mom what had happened. And I was expecting her to bring up the subject, but she didn't.

I was expecting a big intervention but for the rest of the day nothing happened. My dad completely avoided me, my brothers + dad went to the mosque. Nothing was asked of me. Taraweeh came and went, brothers + dad went to the mosque again. Nothing was asked of me. NOW, the whole time, I'm thinking of how to best break the news, tell my mom that I wasn't going to fast. I knew my mom was more understanding; she was the right person to go to. For the most part, I was procrastinating/stalling in my room

Fast forward to 12 AM: I hear a lot of Ramadan talk

My mom came into my room and asked: ""So you're not fasting tomorrow
Me: *stunned* ""Yeah
Mom: ""Okay
(Note: I hadn't eaten dinner that day)

A bit later, mentioned some new video games, what-have-you, saying big brother kind-of things, just trying my best to be that amicable big bro, and my brothers would respond to me as they would before. I was glad to see that my brothers didn't treat me any differently, regardless of what had happened before. My disbelief doesn't change who I am

So, at 1 PM! I wasn't woken up for Suhur + Fajr prayer. The first thing I did was brush my teeth and then drink a giant glass of water. My dad is sleeping. My mom is in the kitchen, cooking. I walked through the kitchen to make sure things were still okay with my mom, she greeted me, etc. Things were still okay!!!

So long story short

Anyway, I do not see a reason to make things worse by rubbing salt in their wounds. So I plan on leaving things the way they are for now. I look forward to the day when all my brothers see religion for what it truly is.

&gt; ~Islam forbade the Arabian practice of burying female infants alive and cursed those who have done so.

Probably the ONLY valid point I've ever heard made by apologetics. But then again

&gt; ~Adam and Eve both have equal blame in succumbing to Satan's temptation and eating from the forbidden tree

What exactly does this have to do with women rights? You're merely stating the story of islamic creation myth of adam &amp; eve

&gt; ~In Islam

Not only are you definitely [wrong

&gt; ~The first university in the Islamic world, in 859 CE.

So? Just because a Muslim woman did great things, which is the Quran and Hadith. In that case, there are many Muslimahs who are also lesbians too who engage in homosexual acts, so does that mean Islam gave gays rights as well? There are many Muslims who drink, have sex out of wedlock, and do drugs, so does this mean Islam allows those things?

&gt; ~The Prophet's first wife Khadijah was a twice-divorced businesswoman who was exceedingly wealthy in her own right. Khadijah was the one to propose to the Prophet.

Khadijah became a business woman LOOOOOONG before he even married Muhammad, suddenly it translates into 'Islam gave women rights""? 

&gt; ~Aisha

How does aisha being a reknowned hadith scholar translates into Islam giving women rights? And no, Aisha is merely the exception, because everyone respected her due to her status as Umm ul-Mukmineen.

&gt; ~The Prophet once said: ""How splendid are the women of the Ansar; shame did not prevent them from becoming learned in their faith.

Again and again, and that they are best to stay and guard the home while their men are out working. It doesn't change the fact that Muhammad thinks women are deficient in intelligence, and that he thinks 2 female witnesses are equal to a single man. Nor does it change the fact that Muhammad thinks a man should never be questioned on why he beats his wife.

&gt; ~Ibn Rushd (Averroes), Arabs and Africans.

Again and again

&gt; ~Birth control is permissible in Islam as long as it's used with the women's permission

This is hardly anything special. People have been practicing coitus interuptus  and various other ways of birth control since the dawn of time

&gt; ~Abortion is allowed in Islam as long as the embryo is less than 120 days in gestation

Can you give any dalils in the Quran or Hadith for this? As far as I know, abortions have been done by people long before Muhammad or Islam even existed.

&gt; ~Indonesia, Turkey and Kyrgyzstan are Muslim majority countries and have all had elected female Heads of State

Again, all of them from different creeds and religions.)

&gt; ~In Islam, she identified and accused the man of raping her. They seized him and brought him to Muhammad, who said to the woman, ""Go away, for God has forgiven you,"" but of the man who had raped her, he said

What

And what's more, what do you think will happen to the woman who reports the rape to the authorities in Islamic countries like Pakistan? Yes, the woman would have no evidence at all to convict the man, but unfortunately she will have evidence of her having sex (like her teared hymen), and she'll get convicted and punished for it. This is exactly what's happening in Pakistan where women who report rape cases are basically admitting they are having sex out of wedlock, and she'll get convicted and punished for it.

TL;DR on the bottom.

Anyway, as they'll believe I'll go to hell, and I can't do that to them. Nonetheless, I am at inner peace with myself for the first time because I finally know what I believe. A little too late though, because I've been engaged for four years.

At first it wasn't anything official. In fact, and my mom continues to go around telling friends and family about him. What's more, he's my cousin, and we both share the same grandfather which scares me for the future. He's only about two and a half years older than me, so at least there isn't a terribly long age gap. He has two older brothers, both were married in the same week (it was like a joint wedding) and I specially visited Pakistan alone to attend. On the last few days, the guy I'm marrying (Let's call him Mason

Need I go on? The thing is, shoes, jewelry, etc for the past three years. I talk to his parents, brothers and their wives on the phone all the time. I can't really deny talking to them; my Mom would get suspicious, and they really are nice people. His mother is my dad's half-sister, and she has always been my favorite aunt. I guess, the main problem is that their Muslim. I don't want to live a Muslim lifestyle

I've only very briefly talked to, that he thinks I'm too young to understand anything right now and he's only ""appeasing me.""

Previously I made a post and was advised to try to talk to him. I pestered my mother for an e-mail address

I don't want this! I don't want to marry him. He said he liked that I covered my head. I guess that could mean he just liked my modesty, when I texted him for a very short time) I told him I was sort of shy. The thing is, I'm not shy anymore. In fact, I've grown up to be bold and confident, which I feel is a wonderful thing but no one in my family seems to appreciate. 

One thing that really bothers me as well is that one of the first things Mason asked me to do when I texted him back then was to hide my FB info, books, my profile picture, school, and I think that's it). When he said that, I was pretty happy because I was a naive little girl who finally got to experience a relationship. I liked the idea of being admired by one guy, and that he may not like other guys getting to know me.

But now it really worries me. What if he's controlling? And even if he turns out to be the nice person everyone claims he is

I'm going to try to organize my thoughts into pros and cons of marrying Mason.

**PROS:** (Or even

* He seems like a good person
* Over the past years they've been sending me clothes (many of them expensive), and call all the time to check up on me. If I end this engagement, how would I repay them?
* In general

**CONS:** (or reasons my marriage will most likely end in a disaster)

* He's a Muslim.
* Is there any way I could tell him? But then
* Kids. Is there any way I won't have them? Honestly, and definitely not ones I would have to raise Muslim. Also, there is the concept of adoption. I really want to be able to adopt kid(s) when I'm married, and Islam can be complicated about that.
* He doesn't understand other sides of me either. I've been living in the U.S for a long time. I like anime, I'm still a child. These are things children do.
* My headscarf. It made me absolutely miserable, I'll definitely be wearing it after. With him, there is no way he could understand why I wouldn't want to wear it.
* Rape culture. Strange point, and I know he won't understand this either. I'm also very feminist, which probably won't work out too well.

So. I'm basically doomed, I can't see a way out of this. If I do refuse or end up finding a boyfriend or something (I plan to  have a go at dating in college) I'll be ruining my family's name. I worry about how the extended family will treat my mother. In the past, my Dad's side of the family has brought her nothing but pain. Over the years she's become too sensitive. She found my rejection of the hijab a ""way of repaying her"" for everything she's done for us. But I can't tell her why I don't want to marry him, can I?

I also worry about my siblings. I have a soon-to-be-turning nine-year-old sister who they could easily take back to Pakistan to avoid anything that happens or might happen with me. I have a brother who's six

I worry so much. Lately it's all I can think about. Is there any way I can break out of this engagement? What can I do? Like I said

I'm also trying to lay low for now, and if I move too far towards one direction the whole sky may collapse on everyone else. What do I do? Is it really worth it to ruin my family's relations and my siblings lives so that *I* may have a good life?

**TL;DR:**
The engagement is very public

You wanted to know my ""story"" about why I'm not muslim anymore.  I'll be brief cause I don't want to type because I'm not sure how fruitful this will be.

I will start by saying I was raised as a muslim.  My parents we're always emphasizing praying and fasting.  Like most

I read the Quran, or always preach fear and hell.  This was not my experience.

Then as I got older, and that the muslims who are denying evolution don't understand this.  It went like this for a while.  I started trying to reconcile new information I was learning, with what I had been taught in islam.

It got more and more uncomfortable as I found more and more things in islam I didn't agree with morally.  I learned more about morality and the source of it.  By then I had learned the importance of evidence for claims.  I slowly started to realize, but when I did, it opened up another problem.  Let's say the quran really did come from god?  How could we, as humans tell?  How could Muhammad?  What criteria would we use to distinguish a quran from god, and a quran from some other being who is not god? So then the following though came to me.  What if god's test isn't ""Do you follow quran""  What if his test is ""Do you follow what you know to be right and wrong, or do you listen to some book?""  What is if the sinners are the ones who blindly follow and kill people for trivial transgressions? 

At that point, in god, until that too went away for the same reason:  I had no good reason to think it is true.

I went to weekend Islamic school for probably six years, I once again went to weekend Islamic school and probably stopped going around 9 or 10th grade. But I still wasn't done. I attended various lectures and went to weekend gathering to discuss the Prophet's sira (perhaps the most dreadful way to spend a Friday night). In addition to all of this, I had a very clear interest in Islam, doing a lotta research to defend it from Islamophobes. In my immature zeal to defend Islam, I got into various insignificant (and somewhat comical) Internet debates.

And yet

Really? I have had Islam shoved in my face for a significant chunk of my youth (which still isn't over: I'm 17) without so much as a glimpse of the alternatives. Does all of those years of Islamic school and boring weekend book clubs not count? Do I have to become a freaking scholar in Islam before I can begin to acknowledge the alternatives?

&gt;3:17PM BST 20 Aug 2012

&gt; In a move that has prompted a demand for a UN investigation by Iran's most celebrated human rights campaigner


&gt; It follows years in which Iranian women students have outperformed men


&gt; Senior clerics in Iran's theocratic regime have become concerned about the social side-effects of rising educational standards among women

&gt;Under the new policy, English translation, hotel management, archaeology, nuclear physics, computer science, electrical engineering


&gt; The Oil Industry University, citing a lack of employer demand. Isfahan University provided a similar rationale for excluding women from its mining engineering degree, claiming 98% of female graduates ended up jobless. 


&gt; Writing to Ban Ki Moon, the high commissioner for human rights, Mrs Ebadi, a human rights lawyer exiled in the UK, said the real agenda was to reduce the proportion of female students to below 50% – from around 65% at present – thereby weakening the Iranian feminist movement in its campaign against discriminatory Islamic laws. 


&gt; ""[It] is part of the recent policy of the Islamic Republic, which was also sent to Ahmad Shaheed, the UN's special rapporteur for human rights in Iran. ""The aim is that women will give up their opposition and demands for their own rights."" 


&gt; The new policy has also been criticised by Iranian parliamentarians


&gt; However, dismissed the controversy, saying that 90% of degrees remain open to both sexes and that single-gender courses were needed to create ""balance"". 


&gt; Iran has highest ratio of female to male undergraduates in the world


&gt; Sociologists have credited women's growing academic success to the increased willingness of religiously-conservative families to send their daughters to university after the 1979 Islamic revolution. The relative decline in the male student population has been attributed to the desire of young Iranian men to ""get rich quick"" without going to university.

&gt;***A blind man had a slave-mother who used to abuse the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) and disparage him***. He forbade her but she did not stop. He rebuked her but she did not give up her habit. One night she began to slander the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) and abuse him.

It was literally something I looked forward to all year round and I loved fasting in Ramadan and praying because I knew it would make my dad and god happy. My dad was the greatest man I knew he moved to America from Palestine when he was 14 and dropped out of school and started working right away. He held odd jobs and was a salesman saving every penny and living in a small apartment with 6 of his cousins. When he was 17 he had saved up enough money to get married and married my mom moved her out here. At 18 he started his first business it failed at 19 he tried again around the time my mom was pregnant with me. He started off selling junk watches and costume jewelry in a five year span he turned it into a booming high end jewelry store. My dad was never extremely religious he was a moderate my mom was more religious than him. Even though I am a girl I was never treated different than my younger brothers even a little better sometimes. I could always talk to him about anything. I remember one time I told him a boy at school told me he likes me, and me and my brothers were never treated as family. His first wife and my mom would always bicker and my step brothers who were 17 and 16 at the time I was 14 would always act inappropriately towards me. We were put into the public school system even though our arabic was weak and we were forced to live by a strict Islamic code. My uncle ( I refuse to call him anything else) forced me to wear a hijab within the first two weeks I was there and put my youngest brother in Islamic classes with his sons to become a hafiz.

Ground rules:

* Make sure you're always respectful. You want to keep the discussion going. Don't let them storm out because of a slip of tongue.
* Make sure they stay on topic. Don't let them wuss out and enter a different topic that enables them to justify their beliefs
* Let them talk. Don't interrupt them- let them talk because that's a better way to enable them to think about what they're saying.
* Use their weapons against them: We all know how much Muslims love using analogies. Go ahead and use them too.

To the deconverting part: 

**Encouraging cognitive dissonance** is absolutely key. Let's all think back to what happened when we first started to deconvert. It shakes you internally

* It won't always work : This is because every person operates differently. There are two types of religious people in Islam in my experience
* If the person is more emotional based: I find it's better to test the morality of Allah/the Prophet. The Aisha business is certainly a good start. Then there's the philosophical ideas on the things ""Allah"" has been said to have done in the past- like kill a bunch of homosexuals
* More logically based people are easier to tackle. Nine times out of ten they're already doubting their religion. Pose this statement: **""If I found one inconsistency in the Quran then I won't believe it's from Allah""**

You need to be informed before starting the discussion. Your lack of information or lack of knowledge in an area will be your weakness. Of course

Truth is we all know we need to be having this conversation.

My mom found out again and this time was very angry. She sent me to live in the UAE with her brother. I spent my senior year here



I started tutoring and doing homework for other students, and found an apartment that my boyfriend and I could afford. Everything was ready, and my escape date was set: June 29th, 2 days after I turn 18. 



My mom came to visit every few months and her last was this week. She came and made a decision. She wants to bring me home. She's purchasing a ticket for June 20th. She wants me to come back



I need to get out. I have a whole life waiting for me, but I can't stay with her. When the first year of islamic education doesn't change anything, what next? There's no future there.

1335095321.0,smj21,Protip: The first thing you should do when trying to debunk 'miracle' verses in the Quran.,zulaikha_idris,39,11,10,"In my experience

For example

------------------------------------------------------------------
**Muslim:** Did you know that the Quran has foretold scientific knowledge? For example, while they will pass as the passing of clouds. [It is] the work of Allah , who perfected all things. Indeed, He is Acquainted with that which you do.* As we know through modern science, mountains are merely the result of two plate tectonics that crash into each other, and these plate tectonics float over a vast layer of liquid magma called the mantle, very much like clouds. Mashallah

**Non-muslim:** But surely there must be a rational explanation for it. The interpretation is too vague / It's just a coincidence / Maybe somebody changed the verse to suit today's scientific knowledge / Maybe muhammad learned from scholars of geology at the time / &lt;insert other other feeble counter argument here&gt;

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Of course

That is why the foremost important thing to do when trying to counter these sort of arguments is simply by **CHECKING THE TRUE MEANING AND CONTEXT OF THE ACTUAL VERSE.**

Example for the 'moving mountains' claim above, or geology or anything as such whatsoever. There, argument defeated with little effort. Easy, isn't it?

Another example is the famous 'sun is a light and moon is a reflected light' claim. [A simple search in Corpus Quran](http://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=nwr) reveals that the word used for 'reflective light' in the verse - NUR - has absolutely nothing to do at all with reflection within the context of the Quran; every single other verse that uses the word NUR simply means 'light' or 'illuminating light'

If looking at the Quranic verse isn't enough

**Most muslims did not become muslims because of their knowledge of the quran and hadith.** 

**So do you need to spend even more years of your life reading up the quran and hadith simply to debate Friday Muslims?**

Read the Quran and Hadith

The point is that you do not have to do intense research simply to dismiss religion. Also remember there are so many other things you can do with your precious time. **You have just one life to live.**

**As a muslim

**When dealing with theists

1.  Validity
2.  Ethics

**By willing to discuss the ethics and morality of religion

&gt;Also while their arguments may hold up against other deists/theists; it fails miserably against people who refuse to drink the Kool Aid.

&gt;They have to first state what god is and how they got this info.

&gt;Then they have to prove a god exists and support this with some objective evidence or arguments. 

&gt;They also have dismiss every other possible explanation they are faced with such as logical fallacies,etc.

&gt;Then they have to disprove all other religions ever and show why their brand of theism is the right one.

&gt;Then they have to explain away all the contradictions in their religion.

&gt;Then they have to prove other claims like god is perfect and just.

This brings me back to the title of my post. I feel so guilty as an Arab former muslim because we have continually invaded and destroyed, and assimilated so many other cultures throughout the centuries. 

I always feel sad when I see or hear about non-arabs being subjected to the more violent parts of Islam.

I get sad that people are forcefully being made to read some book which they don't even understand just so they could please a god that wasn't kind enough to send them a holy book in their own language(124000 prophets that Islam claims were sent not withstanding).

So many different and beautiful cultures lost because of a violent and expansionist ideology.

And it especially breaks my heart knowing it's all false and seeing these people devote their lives to Islam. And even oppressing the people who try to carry on their country's former culture.

Not to mention the billions that flows in corrupt hands of a kingdom that couldn't give 2 shits about their plights

When my mom tells me go read a para of the quran or read 20 rakat of nafal I don't say anything other than ""ok"" and either half assedly do it

I've been doing this for about four years now (started when I was 12, I lie about reading quran, and every time I speak to my family members I'm either silent or nodding my head, faking my agreement, even if I think what they say is truly fucked up. My life seriously is a lie. I can't find any other way to put it. 

The worst part is that there's absolutely nothing I can do about it but suck it up keep the lies going. I seriously think I'll have to keep this going til my parents die. I've seen what happens with my older sister when she disagrees with any of Islams teachings. Nothing good will come from that. My mom turns into another person when religion is involved. My parents are in their 50s and are pretty unhealthy. I wonder if they'll die before they find out...

I've gotten so used to it that I don't get mad anymore. I just kind of feel a layer of sadness among all my emotions and thoughts. It's faint but it's always there. I don't think Islam has brought anyone in my family actual happiness. It's definitely made my parents fear death, has negatively affected every action and thought of mine. I wonder if I woulda been better at football in middle school and freshman year if I didn't have to fast during the season and didn't always have to eat pb&amp;j when I wasn't at home. I wonder if I would have made more friends if I wasn't so scared as a kid. I wonder if things would have been different if I realized that being near a girl wouldn't kill me. But by the time I wizened up I was already a loner and had developed piss poor social skills.

At least once school starts again I'll be busy enough to say I don't have time for too much religion. My dad and siblings back me up when it comes to this, and make the days go by as fast as possible with studying and school work next year. Some kids say that I'll die next year, but I think I can handle it.

I questioned Islam first and foremost because of the way I was treated. I was treated dfiferentl because I am a female. This started when I was 8.

&gt;Allah instructs you concerning your children: for the male, for them is two thirds of one's estate. And if there is only one, for her is half. And for one's parents, to each one of them is a sixth of his estate if he left children. But if he had no children and the parents [alone] inherit from him, then for his mother is one third. And if he had brothers [or sisters], for his mother is a sixth, after any bequest he [may have] made or debt. Your parents or your children - you know not which of them are nearest to you in benefit. [These shares are] an obligation [imposed] by Allah . Indeed

I read the Quran in English because I was being bratty about learning Arabic. Farsi was my first language, it seems, was planned out from day one. Husband dearest would be ""taking care of me.""

I neglected the Quran a while after that but my parents didn't give up the ""proper Muslim daughter"" ideology they used to constantly shame me and tear down my esteem. Cook, then what use are you?"" Cue guilt trips. Cue telling me I was a mistake. Cue telling me 3 boys were good enough. Cue telling me they wish I was aborted but thier fear of Allah was too strong. 

I had to endure double-standards. I only have male siblings and grew up around their friends and our male cousins. I followed them around everywhere. I was either chastized for being amongst boys and at the same time my parents nagged them to take care of me while they worked to put food on the table. My brothers treated me as a burden too. So, unsupervised, all day, while my brothers went out, played sports, and socialized. My youngest brother was the only one there for me. Ever. But he struggled himself but he still tried to live a normal life. That was hard, considering our eldest brother physically and emotionally abused the two of us. The middle brother never put himself in the middle and avoided any conflict. My parents said that eldest male were in charge of everyone else, if he's using physical force

Academically, I brought my marks up just enough to get an acceptance to 3 out of 4 universities. No one ever talked to me about my grades, post-secondary education, the trades, nothing. When I said I would go off to university, no one cared. In 
fact

My middle brother, so, I wasn't allowed to go out much at all. Funny thing is, I never had an interest in sex anyway. I was a dork. Well, up until last year, he finally started to let go. That was until he told me I could move in with him (to get away from our eldest brother) but on the circumstance that I do not have people or boyfriends over, I tell him where I am everyday, of course, eating pork (aka

Well

I live on my own now and am trying to find a way to make things work for myself.

As I shared my story with you, is very different from what the white, Western, feminism the jokes are always about on the posts in r/exmus), I would like it to be taken seriously. I have tried to have a sense of humour about it. I haven't been able to laugh much. In fact, it's triggered some things for me. 

Regardless

This mostly for recovery. I am still recovering. This is my only outlet to speak about the part of Islam that I despise. Despite everything that's happened to me

I know that we don't have a strong emphasis on women's issues as much in this subreddit. I do not wish to imply that it's because men are not sympathetic, for me it was women and human rights violations.

If it's not an area you wish to speak about in a constructive manner, your mothers, your friends, a hell of a lot of women in this world. And keep in mind, a majority of what I said could have been done to a male. Islam is patriarchal. Everyone's a victim. But men do have a privilege in Islam and the suffering I and many others had to endure was because they were women.

- I lied for several years that I was taking 'flute lessons' when I was really going to a dance studio to take ballet. I would even carry my flute case and sheet music with me to keep up the pretense. 

- Later I would pretend that I was going to 'work' when I was really driving downtown for ballet classes. One time I got into a car accident on my way to the city and I drove my damaged car back to fake that the accident happened 5 miles from my parents house.

- Sneaking in through windows that I set up to look like they were locked so I could push them open from the outside later.

- At sunday school I would just sit in the back and listen to music on headphones under my hijab and then when I could drive

- To make myself feel better about everything I was doing I told myself that I could be religious when I was old. LOL

I have met ex-muslims in various stages of this, others are only discovering which pieces they've lost along the way.

*But you're not alone.* One thing this person mentioned was a feeling of utter, just from a few words. Feelings of suicide. Actually trying. Depression. That's what isolation can mean.

As AgentVoid has made clear

For anonymity, within a 1 mile radius. It is **insane** how many of us are there.

Try and reach out through here. Nothing will support you more than having someone who understands. Nothing makes me as happy as to know that there are guys and girls out there

It's always important to get psychological counselling. But there is only so much they can help, and have gone through similar rough patches.

Thanks for listening

As of now, but it is what is true.

To give some background of myself

I am identifying myself as agnostic. It is still very fuzzy for me because I am stuck between atheism and some type of agnosticism with a deity or god involved. I somewhat feel like there is something out there that started everything but then I don't. When I started realizing what I believe(or disbelieve), but it had a feeling of guilt with it because I left the only religion I knew. I still feel kind of guilty, but I'm sure it will pass. I haven't told anyone yet and I made this account just for the occasion of posting this. I guess this my way of accepting it. This is a big step for me and I felt the need to share with someone. Now, where to go from here?

1. Because I don't believe a just God would punish people for being bad to him, I wouldn't care whether people believe in me or not, as long as they are good to each other if I was a god.

2. One thing that I have already read on this subreddit

3. There was one part of the Quran, he split the moon in half to show them that he was a man of God. However, the Kafir were stubborn and held fast to their own beliefs. Really? Sure they don't believe and all, but they're not stupid! If someone split the moon in front of them, they wouldn't just ""be stubborn"". And splitting the moon? I'd like to see how that didn't fuck up the Earth's tides and etc.
