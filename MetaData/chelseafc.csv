Over the past few days it has become quite tedious to see every link mentioning Lampard posted and taken as gospel

On to business, Lampard was at his peak and was continuing to set the example by which other midfielders were measured. His salary at the time was generous even relatively speaking but he wanted more. Through a series of media rumblings, 'quotes' and vague allusions made by both Frank and his agent, Steve Kutner, it became obvious that he was holding the threat of a move to Inter Milan over the head of the club. This situation resolved itself by a bumper deal for Frank taking his salary to £150k a week and the top of the Chelsea pay scale. Frank also lead the anti-AVB theatrics that plagued his reign. Whether one agrees or disagrees with AVB's methods, he was shown a complete lack of respect by Lampard and others which made his position untenable. A small detail for most fans but a terminal error in the eyes of the hierarchy of the club. Twice now he has essentially held the club to ransom, once to increase his salary and the other time to guarantee his standing at the club. These transgressions have not been forgotten, the stance of the club is to no longer indulge the whims of the players, respect is due for that

There is a lot more I could say about Lampard but I shall refrain. His agent and him have tried to work and angle and the club has basically called their bluff. If anything, a man who served with unquestionable loyalty. I told you all here that he was leaving before it was announced, we had that discussion. However you should all know that had we not won the Champions League, he would have stayed on a rolling deal to 'do a Giggs/Scholes'. He left with everyone's blessings and reputation larger than ever, aided in no small part by the fairytale ending with his last kick of the ball for Chelsea. He knew when it could get no better and knowing when to walk away is an underrated aspect of a footballer's career and how we perceive it later on. All this negativity about the club is being fed to a voracious media from Frank's management and to be honest it leaves a sour taste in the mouth. The same media who slated us for having old players on big money are now demanding we give whatever it takes to keep a 35 year old until he's 37. Hypocrisy that should be admired for it's bravado

John Terry also pulled a 'Lampard' some time ago. He wanted a pay increase and threatened a move to City to get it, the club relented and bowed to his demands but his card was marked. His situation has been dealt more blows after the Wayne Bridge/Vanessa Perroncal incident and the Anton Ferdinand case. He is now seen as a hinderance in terms of reputation to the club and is no longer untouchable as he was for so many years. He has another 18 months to go on his deal, do not expect him to be playing for Chelsea after that

Ashley Cole is the one that I disagree with (most), if Cole has said that he doesn't want a new deal then there is no point negotiating. I would love to see him stay though, more so than Lampard he is a crucial part of our team

I've waffled on long enough here, out go the ageing superstars on huge pay deals and in come younger, hungrier players on half the salary and who have resale value (Torres aside). Cole, Lampard and Terry earn a combined £450k roughly, over £20m a year in combined renumeration. The club feels the money could be better spent elsewhere while achieving a long standing aim of removing the power base of the players and allowing for a more stable management structure. I expect Benitez to oversee the dirty work as the fans dislike him anyway and he is due to leave in the Summer, a new manager can come in with almost a clean slate and shape the future

It's great that people will vehemently defend Roman on r/soccer, I could not care less what other fans think

My biggest issue with this website, as is every commenter bar the obvious troublemakers. This is simply ridiculous. Regarding Roman, I'm bored of seeing children comment on the thought processes and decision making of one of the richest, most successful men in the world. They have no idea as to how the real world works, let alone the rarified atmosphere of Billion Pound deals. I hate to be so blunt, but I'm sure most of you who have read my comments have figured out that I'm not exactly short of a few notes, yet I would never dare suggest that I understood the complexities of the moves that Roman and other such businessmen make, why don't we get Kim Kardashian to teach Professor Hawking the finer points of theoretical astrophysics while we're at it

A lot of this stemmed from that Matthew Syed interview on SSN which is now held as some definitive moment in the public understanding of football ownership by less than Heavenly figures. Bollucks. It just shows how fucking clueless people are if they will happily regurgitate the claims of one man as fact. This argument is always conflated by the defenders in to ""Well he's right about the way Roman amassed his fortune"" as if that is valid justification. Everybody knows this, decisive and canny. It's such a vapid argument that because Syed correctly repeated this well-known fact, everything else he says must be true also. The idea that being an owner of a Football Club would protect you from the long hand of Putin is without basis too, yet it's now repeated by many as fact. The brazen way in which the Russian leadership deals with it's enemies means nobody is safe, anybody with any sort of background knowledge of the numerous incidents involving 'Russia's enemies' would laugh at the notion that owning Chelsea is protection

Which leads me to another issue. When did Roman become Putin's enemy? Apparently this is true, the Russian Football team (he paid Hiddink's wages personally) and large sponsorships of Russian sports teams along with endowments to museums, art galleries and other artistic endeavours. When he wanted to resign from his post as Governor, Putin refused and demanded he stay, not only as a shining light to other Ogligarchs but because of the good he was doing. It's part of an approach that publicly shames those who have hoarded wealth and run away, while showering praise on those who are seen to be giving it back to the people. The fact that Roman still works in Russia is enough proof that he is not on unfriendly terms with Putin, if he were that would be the last place on Earth he would ever set foot

Anyway, Villa, etc.) yours is a man who has lavished vast funds to make this club the force they are today, whose Son is being groomed to take the reins (when 'everybody' knew Roman would leave within a year or two of taking over) and who attends more games than almost any other owner I can think of. I'll let you in to a secret, nobody worth that much money has a clean history, it's just that some dark pasts are more well known than others",,self,,

Our sub has grown massively since the last transfer window and because of that we're starting to see some of the issues that come along with that kind of growth. An increase of memes and also many duplicate posts.

Today alone has seen 3 submissions regarding Benitezs wink to Mourinhos return. [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/1duvxg/rafa_benitez_hints_at_mourinho_return_during_a/)

As well as several submissions concerning Andres Schurrles imminent arrival; [here](http://redd.it/1dvgr9)

In order to cut down on clutter I am proposing that the mods will delete duplicate posts

We will continue not to delete Memes or image posts if they are relevant to Chelsea FC, some people here love them and some hate them,if you hate them you're just going to have to tolerate them I'm afraid..

* According to the mirror Jose is planning a £90mil double swoop for both [**Cavani and Hulk**](http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/406124/Jose-Mourinho-plans-90m-double-swoop-for-Edinson-Cavani-and-Hulk?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+daily-express-football-news+%28Daily+Express+%3A%3A+Football+Feed%29) Just think for a moment what that might look like as we line up against Crystal Palace. It's fucking bonkers.

* Here's an article with little substance linking us to [**Wayne Rooney**](http://www.touchlinetalk.com/chelsea-set-to-bid-for-arsenal-target/53687/?) again, I couldn't see them getting along for some reason. can someone photoshop them as the Odd Couple?

* In our search for a new Centre Back we have leapt ahead of Manchester United in the race to buy [**Eliaquim Mangala**](http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/chelsea-transfer-news-portos-eliaquim-1940789?) as David Moyes is sitting on Blackpool beach wearing a kiss-me-quick hat and trying not to get Mr Whippy down his new Manchester United shirt.

* Here's another rumour that doesn't want to die a horrible death

* Did you see Arsenal have submitted a bid for [**Felliani?**](http://www.dailystar.co.uk/football/view/319413/?) well if they want him

* his some really bad news for all us Chelsea fans, the Welsh are frightening negotiators too, ask any leek salesman.

* Ok so with all these amazing players coming in who's leaving? First up utility Striker [**Demba Ba**](http://metro.co.uk/2013/06/09/demba-ba-facing-chelsea-exit-as-new-boss-jose-mourinho-sets-out-transfer-plans-3833734/?) we're gonna try and dump him on the Emirates Lawn and drive off really fast in JT's bentley.

* Also on his way out is [**Victor Moses**](http://myevertonnews.com/everton-eye-10m-bid-for-chelsea-starlet-victor-moses/) who could be heading to Everton

* Contary to reports elsewher the Sun has [**Captain, we need to keep JT at the club whatever role he is playing, he is the lifeblood and although he's a twat sometimes, he's an example to all the new kids who come to the club with his love of all things Chelsea.

This is not meant to be an exhaustive analysis by any means and please feel free to add any relevant information/thoughts/questions.

----------------------------------

[Marco van Ginkel](http://www.transfermarkt.com/en/marco-van-ginkel/leistungsdaten/spieler_147034_2012.html)
------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------


* **Age:** 20

* **Position**: CM

* **Nationality:** Netherlands

--------------------------------------------------

**Stats**

--------------------------------------------------------------
* **Appearances:** 33 (Eredivisie)

* **Goals**: 8

* **Assists:** 10*

* **MPG**: 369 (2954 minutes played)

---------------------------------------------------
**Play Style**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------


**van Ginkel** shows to be a tidy midfielder who can tackle when needed. His reading of the game is excellent [[Example]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=P_Il6Gximnw#t=24s). 

His passing is excellent and is often compared to Lampards' [[Example]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=P_Il6Gximnw#t=50s).

 He often likes to pick out a long cross-field ball [[Example]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=P_Il6Gximnw#t=88s) but is able to play shorter

He definitely has an eye for goal and shoots fairly often for a CM

He likes to make driving runs from deep in the opponents half and often dribbles multiple players neatly [[Example]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=nC5EiYa2GmQ#t=19s)[[Example 2]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=nC5EiYa2GmQ#t=77s). 

He is very quick and uses his speed to beat players seemingly casually

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Potential**

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think with our current lack of options in CM

--------------------------------------------------------------------------


*Not sure if amount of assists is reliable. Please correct me if that's wrong.

Mass sympathy and upvotes for comments which suggest that last nights 'rant' was somehow justified. People seem to actually believe that Benitez is the victim in all of this. Does no one realise that he accepted the role of **interim** manager, he has no right to complain about being given that title. As I said in another thread, there is no other 'top' manager (a category Benitez bizarrely finds himself in) that would accept such a demeaning title.


As early as the replay against Birmingham in the FA Cup last season when he was first linked with the job, you're not wanted here""). Benitez was interviewed around that time, and flirted with the role despite the interviewer informing him of the crowds dislike; he laughed it off and then made the appropriate maneuvers and agent whisperings to be right there and ready to succeed Roberto Di Mateo less than a day after his dismissal.


Benitez knew full well he would be unpopular with the crowd, opportunism and disbelief that he could land another top European manager job after what happened at Inter Milan, he took it anyway. Upon his arrival he stated that he would 'win over' the Chelsea fans with results, that clearly didn't happen, the results didn't come and the dissent grew louder. I accept that football fans are fickle and that if he inspired us to something resembling a title challenge and had a coherent strategy then the crowd would be much more placid. But to then blame the fans negativity is the ultimate scandal and embarrassment to cover the fact that he has failed again, he couldn't get the results that were supposed to 'win us over', so it somehow became our fault not his; even though he knew what he was walking into.


Hopefully this has explained why I find it absolutely crazy how much support he is getting around here. Chelsea fans get stick for being 'plastic' and 'glory hunting', and we don't want him now. Outsiders say we are stupid and harsh to berate our own manager, but if we had sucked up to him in the vein hope of him bringing us success, then IMO that is the truly plastic attitude; some of us at Chelsea still have some loyalty.


My final point is that of course Benitez is a massive distraction for a completely dysfunctionally run football club. Sacking Di Matteo was a disgrace

________

Hey guys. 

The off season is shit and the way we can counter that is by broadcasting Chelsea matches and watching them together as a sub especially the great moments in our history. We do this on /r/Formula1 as well as the time between races is very long so we have 1 person streaming a couple of races and in the comments those who are watching the stream comment.

We can include all the classics which many of you might not have seen until now and also our recent matches which were good. 

This will help pass the time until the season and it will also help us revisit those memories.

Here is what I can provide :

- 1) A full streaming guide to anyone who has the upload bandwidth necessary (which isn't even that great to be honest).

- 2) Full detail to how to stream both for the sub and the broadcaster

- 3) Pretty much any big match from our history. I mod /r/FootballDownload and can provide pretty much any match necessary.

- 4) A list of matches both past and present to watch. I can make up a great list since I've been watching Chelsea for a long long time.

My only limitation is the upload speed. I do a lot of torrent work which is why my upload speed is always occupied. This means my streams will be low quality and choppy. Most of you can easily stream it with your bandwidth and the streams will be available on laptops

Nevertheless I will try to do some demo streams from my end to see if my Internet can hold up. I have all the download speed necessary but I doubt the available part of my upload speed can support it adequately.

Anyway I know for sure we will get this system up and running and we can enjoy the off season. Leave your questions below and I'll answer them and also if you are interested.

At this point in my life

Long story short, they way they carried themselves. It was beautiful. I'm sure some on this subreddit can relate. I subsequently became an avid Chelsea fan.

Pretty soon, but after a little while (coincidentally around the time Chelsea acquired Drogba) my father became bored of crime dramas and started watching the games with me. And guess what?

He fell in love too. We began to watch so many games (in the past I'd skip some games if I wanted to sleep in or something but no longer) that it became a tradition to wake up early every Saturday morning to watch our Chelsea FC take the field.

A couple years later, not just those in which Chelsea participated in. But it was always much more exciting to watch Chelsea games. Primarily of course because of our love for the team, but there was something else. Someone, one player, made them much more unique. Didier Drogba. He was such a...different...player. He was someone I always thought could play any position but was simply divine as a striker.

His playing style was so unique. His seemingly infinite strength, cometh the man, and no one embodies this more than Drogba. Just check out his goals:appearances ratio in cup finals. I think it was about 1:1? Absolutely insane.

He is also a unique person. He is one who not only gives back to the community but goes above and beyond the call of duty. For starters

My father and I were huge Chelsea fans. But we also became huge Drogba fans.

And as we progressed through the years, the night in Moscow which we will never speak of again, the league/cup double in 10/11.

And as we lived through the best and worst of the club, frustration, desperation, and sadness of Moscow, ecstasy again with the second damned golden boot!

The important thing is that we lived through these emotional experiences together. This was completely foreign to us. But Chelsea

Then this year happened.

It was a year of ups and downs. For my father and I

We had grown very close. I know that he would have loved to have seen the FA Cup victory, I know that he would have given anything to have seen Chelsea with the champions league. ESPECIALLY in the manner they did. Specifically, doing it as underdogs and with Drogba dominating.

In any case, they were without a doubt the best years of my life.

So Drogba. I will miss you. Watching Chelsea won't be the same with you anymore. But I'll always support you in whatever you do, present, or future.

Thank you.",self,t5_2rsl6,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/viooo/something_id_like_to_say_about_drogba/

Make a match thread if everyone wants to mash their keyboards and abuse the shift button each time we score or a great play happens. Or just keep it to one thread. Or go to /r/soccer

They also hide any solid discussion threads that arise during or after the match.

Just my 2 cents. Don't want to put a damper on a great win

1. After his first season at Chelsea how do you feel has lived up to his **hype** coming into the season

2. **13 Goals and 20 Assists** do you think he can beat it

3. As many of us has discussed over the season do you think he will stay at chelsea for a long time or try to move onto

4. Many people claims that Eden has the **potential** to become a Ballon d'or winner in the future. How far do you guys think he can go?

Well Mr.Paul left the world on 26th October 2010..or did he?

I ran some famous names through the worlds most sophisticated algorithms until I discovered that Paul was still alive in this world.

Narrowed the search down to two names. My conclusion was that it was either Ron Paul or OctaChaz being used as a dummy by Paul's mystical powers.

After visiting /r/circlejerk it dawned on me that Paul could not possibly be Ron Paul. Why would he change his main objective and run for the president of USA? He could have done that after the world cup but did he?

That just leaves one person behind who is..yup you've guess it **dramatic music** OCTACHAZ. **OCTO**pus **OCTA**chaz coincidence? Take a look at this!

**Octachaz | Octopus|**

Reddit account created after Paul 'died' | 'Died' before OctaChaz account was created

My conclusion is that OctoPus was a Chelsea fan but his fan base would have flipped if this truth were to surface. So he 'died' and alas OctaChaz joins /r/ChelseaFC and becomes a sudden mystical being.

&gt; When the board recognised that we were severely lacking depth (especially in midfield - remembering that we lost Ballack

The January transfer window had nothing to do with midfield (obvious as the players you listed aren’t midfielders). That transfer window was in response to the first of the lately normal winter slumps that Chelsea has. You can’t honestly believe the board thought to respond to a midfield problem with a striker and defender…  We all know Torres was RA’s thing, Alex was getting injured and Terry was injured earlier in the season. Buying a new CB was increasing depth in the squad in the back, which you say they weren’t worried about. You can’t just gloss over that to make your point.
&gt;So in 2010-11, Lampard, Essien and Obi. Zhirkov and Malouda did jobs at various times. That's it.

I can’t say we only had 4 people in midfield and casually throw in Zhirkov and the amazing Malouda. Malouda had 15g/15a in 09/10 so one would expect him to be playing in 10/11 as well. Turns out he was extremely important in the Ancelotti diamond and netted the club 13 goals (more than even Drogba) in 10/11. Zhirkov wasn’t nearly as prolific, 12 of those in the league. Those stats scream depth player. You’ve also ignored that we bought Yossi and McEachran started making league appearances (9 that season, 17 overall). We had Essien, Ramires (bought), Lampard, Mikel, Malouda, Yossi (bought), and Beletti would have been the difference we needed. I love Ballack so I do wish we kept him. 
&gt;Why did this happen? This happened because of the organisational vacuum at the top of the club. This club is run at Roman Abramovich's discretion. When he wants someone, the other £25m, the jury is out on) on two players. What does this say about the organisation of the club to you?

You have a sample size of two, I don’t think that reflects his potential. I think he’s got what it takes to be a captain one day, and I’d rather we have players like him who love Chelsea down to their blood. What does this all tell me? It tells me we have an owner who brought Chelsea to the forefront of football and he has some desires that he’s carried through on, to perhaps the detriment of the club. You may disagree with the club’s board etc., but no one can deny they’ve gotten us amazing players over the years just as well. 
&gt;Here's the best bit - what happens to the men responsible for the dismal squad? Nothing really. Abramovich pet Emenalo is promoted to Director of Football

He got that position in July 2011. Prior to that he was scout and a coach, what exactly do you want to fire these folk for? Arnesen I did not like, so I agree he never should have been there. As much as we all would have liked Ancelotti, it’s not hard to see where the board were coming from. Ancelotti’s system just didn’t have long term potential, and with the board seeking a different style of play for Chelsea (something I have hated about by the way) following a poor display against United in the UCL he was let go. Keep in mind that’s not my appraisal, but how the board felt. At that moment, AVB was a great idea. We’ll never know the reason behind Wilkins’ sack
&gt;It's 2011. Bright young thing

Seeing how he was already at Chelsea in the past
&gt; Will he be hamstrung by a complete lack of organisation at the top? Will be be undermined by promising him the complete support of the board and the owner, let's see.

You have got to be kidding me. Ok, Juan Mata (yay), Davila, Meireles (injury signing), and poor poor Lukaku. Davila had loan written all over him, but that’s 2 midfielders and an amazing raw young striker brought in. AVB idiotically ruined one year of Lukaku’s life, there is no defending that. Changes don’t happen overnight, but was strong enough. 
&gt;Moving out over the summer, our options were Ramires, Lampard and Mikel. Not to forget an extremely raw 19 year old Oriol Romeu (for whom you have to wonder why he was available at £3m from Barcelona) and Josh McEachran, who would eventually go out on loan. Essien's injury caused a last minute purchase of Raul Meireles. As you can see, the planning of this isn't great. Injuries do happen, but we're fairly light there anyway.

Let’s see, so we brought in Meireles for cover. I suppose they could have just assumed Essien would get injured, but Mikel and Ramires would be able to cover. At the end of the window, we had Romeu, Essien (injured), Ramires, Lamps, Malouda, but you can’t go buy a whole squad in one window. Of the 8
&gt;As for the moving out of the old guard

Moving out the old guard is bullshit. No one can convince me that we would have been better off without Cech, and Drogba starting from last year. As an example, United don’t keep their senior players for no reason. Club legends foster development of the youth and, more importantly, put experience on the pitch. Getting rid of them in one summer would have been a death sentence to our season last year and for seasons to come. The newer players training with the old guard is invaluable. It makes no sense to have wanted them to move out in summer like some unwanted roommate.

* Back in February, which led to snide comments about Serie A being superior to the Premier League. Suddenly, there was an excited interest among neutral fans at the prospect of seeing all of the English sides being knocked out so early. Then, the second leg came and we managed to [make a comeback](http://www.soccerclips.net/videos/chelsea-4-1-napoli-ivanovic1). Winning 4-1 on an unforgettable night, we overturned the deficit and knocked out the same team that had stumped Manchester City on two separate occasions. Some people were shell-shocked; especially the guys who thought that Napoli's counter-attack would rip right us apart. Suddenly, the screams of ""Forza Napoli!"" faded into silence and talk about the demise of the EPL teams in Europe was put on hold.

* For the quarter finals, as if Chelsea were some sort of easy ticket to the semi-finals. One person stated: ""Benfica will be more happy with this tie than Chelsea!"" Anyway, the two legs were played out and we ended up [winning 3-1 on aggregate](http://www.soccerclips.net/videos/chelsea-2-1-benfica-meireles). Benfica's manager exhibited critical amounts of butthurt after the game and we were on our way to face Barcelona in the semis. 

* For the semi finals, in the first leg at Stamford Bridge, we defended like gladiators and shocked everyone by [grabbing a goal from a quick counter attack](http://www.soccerclips.net/videos/chelsea-1-0-barcelona-drogba1). The game ended at 1-0, much to everyone's surprise. As soon as the game was over, the game at the Nou Camp started to loom over our heads and most people expressed their belief that we would still end up losing heavily in the end. People mentioned the pitch size and how Barca would have more space to pass. They brought up the fact that the Nou Camp is a fortress. Basically; the odds were stacked against us. When the away leg came and we let in 2 goals and John Terry had been sent off, nobody believed that we had a chance (myself included). The odds of us turning the game around at that particular moment were 220-1. However, out of nowhere, we defended with all of our might and managed to keep Barca out. When Messi missed his penalty, at the Nou Camp. You couldn't write this stuff.

So anyway; I'd just like to say that this season has been terrific and that I will remember it for years to come, where the old guard banded together with the new guard and overturned all of the odds. This season can only end up getting better, not worse. And hey, at least after this game, we all get to have some sort of mental rest from the dramatic highs and lows that this season has cast upon us.

[I told Stamford that Abramovich was going to drop big money on Gunnersaurus

Anyway

Hazard is incredible at dribbling. Obviously you all know this. I was lucky enough to be perched near a corner flag and was treated to a great view. In person

Ramires and Oscar both look like children. It's shocking how small they are. Especially since they were warming up next to Jamal Blackman

Speaking of which

Demba Ba looks a little lack luster, it was a treat to see someone enjoying being out on the pitch that much. It looked like how I imagine I would look if I suddenly had time on the pitch.

Unfortunately I had a very low angle

Lampard was... well

In defense

And to end on a sour note... Torres looks like a broken man off the pitch. It breaks my heart. I wanted to make a sign that said ""Fernando I'm over it

* First up [Falcao](http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4742082/Falcaos-French-fancy.html) would rather go to Paris

* [Lukaku](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2261823/Romelu-Lukaku-wants-stay-West-Brom.html) is having so much fun at WBA he would like to stay another year

* The daily Star have us all but signed [Iago Aspas](http://www.dailystar.co.uk/football/view/292887/Spanish-goal-ace-Iago-Aspas-heading-to-Chelsea/) the celta Vigo striker I mentioned last week. £8.5m for Michu 2.0 (I hope).

* This one is in French but basically it states that we will bid for [Mbia](http://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Mbia-vers-chelsea/342183#xtor=RSS-1) if QPR get M'Villa. not sure about this one though...

* [Kalou](http://www.dailystar.co.uk/football/view/292929/QPR-boss-Harry-Redknapp-eyes-ex-Chelsea-star-Salomon-Kalou-and-Swansea-s-Danny-Graham/) maybe going back to West london to play for... QPR. I thought he left on rather good terms as well.

* [Guardiola](http://www.givemefootball.com/324638-german-giants-beat-chelsea-manchester-united-to-first-guardiola-move) news just in, but could the footballing aesthetic and club set-up be more appealing to the in demand Spainard?

* [Willian](http://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-and-spurs-target-willian-runs-into-trouble-at-shakhtar-8450921.html) who some papers are still claiming is a target for Chelsea, because he's a big sulky, unprofessional baby. Should fit in well in North London then.

* and finally a Geordie car washer (or something) is pissed off because [Demba Ba](http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/newcastle-car-cleaner-fuming-after-1534131) still owes him £40 or something. Do one son

I'm a Nigerian football fan of Chelsea FC. I normally only read on reddit but yesterday something grabbed my attention and I had to react. There was a discussion on my fellow Nigerian Kenneth Omeruo that has apparently started the popular opinion that we should look at Kenneth to strenghten our defense next year.

I do not know who started this, you can all save this post.

This guy failed testing at 8 different clubs before joining Standard De Liege. His only good side is that he's one big pile of muscle (extremely strong and pacey). He cannot control a ball, but to our national team and to a club like Chelsea. Something is very, very fishy with this players agent and transfers.",,False,self,t5_2rsl6,,http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/1gyr6h/something_people_apparently_have_not_realised/

Ended 1-0. We had double our number of police escort us back to the train station, and it was nowhere near enough.""

Whenever we are in a tight spot, it is another story I think about. The day Chelsea got relegated to the third division coincided with my uncles wedding. My dad remembers running in and out of the ceremony, checking on the results. We ended up losing 1-0 to QPR, and were relegated. Later that night, he's sat around, absolutely dejected.

he told her to fuck off.

    * Of his 13 goals this season, although it wasn't enough to inspire Leverkusen to victory.

* #4) [Hoffenheim 0-1 Bayer Leverkusen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=pLK8z4SHzE4)

    * Perhaps the best thing about this goal is that Schurrle is running at pace when he collects the ball

* #3) [Germany 2-0 Uruguay](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=85m8BSFVHms)

    * Schurrle shows exactly why he shouldn't be give too much space

* #2) [FC Augsburg 1-3 Bayer Leverkusen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=kz6g43t7rm0)

     * A rare strike with his left foot, before rifling a shot into the bottom corner with his left peg.


* #1) [Bayer Leverkusen 2-2 Borussia Moenchengladbach](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=L_kCzMMw1bA)

   * A classic Andre Schurrle goal. He picks the ball up on the left wing and drifts in on his favoured right foot before lashing an unstoppable strike into the far corner.

The [Edison Cavani thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/1h00ky/rumour_chelsea_58m_cavani_deal/) this morning for instance has split opinion. Please don't downvote someone for having a differing opinion to yourself. The reasons for this are many but a couple of the biggies are;

* If you down vote someone for their opinion, the more commentors we have in discussions the better they are.

* The quality of the the discussions will drop

* It's just not sporting!

If someone has posted a comment you think is incorrect, some people don't have your encyclopaedic knowledge of Hazards pass completion record when he was 15!
