If speech is so highly regulated
  
Banning non-terrorists from a nation really sucks for the reasons I pointed out. If Britain wants to ban ring wingers like Bill O'Reilly, Michael Savage, etc then they may as well cut their wrists over all the people in the world who have different beliefs and values. It must be even worse to be banned from Canada because geographically its so huge.

EDIT: I do not mean to come off as smug. I'm genuinely interested because I feel one of the valuable things about this subreddit is that it has encouraged cross-partisan discussion. While everyone doesn't see eye to eye all the time, of course), and while I don't mean to accuse anyone of anything, I think it's very valuable to have that other point of view to keep us all honest and ensure that our views (or my views, at least) do not become too tinted by the team-y nature of politics. The conservative and Conservative voices in this subreddit are extremely valuable, and I'm sad that I haven't seen them as much lately.

Things started well with a minority government. As most of you know, and I’m ok with this. The government needs new revenue streams, and the licencing system is not free, and does the majority of heavy lifting for gun control. [It’s expected that this will ultimately bring in $18 million in revenue](http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/04/14/conservatives-bring-back-long-waived-gun-licence-fees-expect-18-million-in-revenue/). 

Next is the removal of the Firearms Registry. I was elated to see it go. It cost an estimated [$2 billion](http://www.garymauser.net/pdf/HubrisNorth.pdf) (PDF - pg. 1) by 2007, many of you have read), I’ve come to the conclusion that the registry was pretty damned useless. It was wasted money. If anyone wants to read my paper on the registry, I can send you a link to it. 

These were both issues that directly affected me. Joe Fiorito, [2](http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2010/02/01/fiorito_is_toronto_safer_without_my_bird_gun.html), [3](http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2010/03/22/fiorito_still_trying_to_get_my_bird_gun_back.html). I don’t know if he got his bird gun back, but I hope so. Yes, it's his fault for letting his licence lapse, but the heavyhandedness of the police could've turned things south pretty quickly. 

But in other situations

Now the bad. I’ll start with what irks me the most. Transparency. For a party that campaigned on being transparent and accountable

Omnibus Bills are our next stop. [For someone who hated omnibus bills back when the Liberals were in power](http://openparliament.ca/debates/1994/3/25/stephen-harper-1/only/), and what the future effects may be. They also negate the ability of MPs to [represent their constituents](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/in-praise-of-stephen-harper-the-opposition-mp-who-fought-omnibus-bills/article5661305/). 

Closing of the Experimental Lakes Area. This is probably the most boneheaded move I’ve ever seen. The ELA is one of a kind, [a department that has faced consistent budget cuts since ’90-’91](http://www.mindentimes.ca/2012/04/24/the-incredible-shrinking-mnr), and is losing [$70 million over the next three years](http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2012/06/28/ministry_of_natural_resources_job_cuts_office_closures_coming_province_says.html).

[No decriminalization of marijuana](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2011/11/25/bc-science-world.html). I’m not a smoker myself

This doesn’t just go for the Government of Canada

Another issue I’d like tackled. 

A proper definition for “safe storage of a firearm”. [Lorne Gunter](http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/02/01/lorne-gunter-canadas-laws-on-the-safe-storage-of-firearms-need-clarifying/) explains this better than I could. 

There’s more for all three sections…but my brain’s starting to hurt. I’ve looked at other parties closely, but right now that’s just a hope. If another party were to come along that fills the void between the Liberals and Conservatives, I’d be a happy camper.

People obviously have some animosity towards our leader


Edit: That was informative and surprisingly civil. Thank you for all the insightful feedback. 

My two cents, but seems to be content with ignoring the populace in general (beyond tweeting merry Christmas).  As the leader of a modern democratic country, there is no excuse for this.

I know charisma and good PR are not mandatory traits for a Prime Minister, and give them goals and purpose, is not fulfilling their role. I would like to point out that President Obama is an inspirational leader with a clear vision that he has no problem communicating with the populace he governs. At this point, anything less than that is a failed opportunity.

**Transcript of Ezra Levant’s broadcast, 2012**
 
**Ezra Levant 00:00:02.98** 

On Friday, they're coming from Hungary for crying out loud, a rich, generous, liberal democracy. No one's a refugee from Hungary, at least not since it was liberated from the Nazis and then from the Soviets. For more than 20 years, it's been free! 

But these are Gypsies! A culture synonymous with swindlers. The phrase 'Gypsy' and 'cheater' have been so interchangeable historically that the word has entered the English language as a verb: 'He gypped me.' Well, as they have done in Europe for centuries. 

Well, police revealed the depth of Gypsy crime in Canada that has accompanied this wave of fake refugees.  Ezra Levant 00:00:06.56 
Now let me stop before you blow your hate crime whistle at me for saying Gypsy or gypped. See, Travellers, the point of that is to obscure the truth. 

But look at Gypsies! And one of the central characteristics of their culture, because it's an awful truth that we don't want to contemplate. 

Now I believe that anyone out there regardless of their race or their religion or their language or their place of birth

**Ezra Levant 00:00:09.60** 

But Gypsies aren't a race, a shiftless group of hobos that doesn't believe in property rights for themselves - they're nomads - or for others, they rob people blind! 

Now the scourge has come to Canada through fake refugee claims, all from Hungary. The Canadian Border Services Agency estimates that just the paperwork and processing of these fake refugees costs almost a quarter billion dollars a year. And today, police in Ontario are taking to the courts more cases of the damage that they say they have found on the streets.   

**Ezra Levant 00:02:23.63** 

Look at this list of suspects released by Durham police - Gypsy after Gypsy after Gypsy - they gypped their way into Canada, theft, fraud: Gypsy! But look at that, not on her own - as part of a criminal organization. We're used to biker gangs, we're used to the Hell's Angels or the Mafia. They're not races or religions, they're cultural groups, subcultures, fraud. It's not all non-violent, fraud, they're extended family

**Ezra Levant 00:02:34.73** 

Notice how many women there are on this list. Of course, it's a family affair. In fact, women and children are the best at it, because we liberal Canadians or Europeans would never suspect a child, or a mom, or both working together. Now don't worry, I won't show you all the suspects on this list - there are just too many. But every last one of them is a Gypsy. Just some of the 5, none of these folks have been convicted

**Ezra Levant 00:04:20.51** 

Durham Regional Police say that street Gypsies have four particular strategies: 

“Street distraction” - that's where a young girl will walk up to a citizen, and then rip off the real, expensive necklace in the commotion. 

“Store distraction” is another one

“Shopper distraction” – that's where someone watches you enter your PIN at a store and then pickpocketing your wallet in the parking lot. 

And “family in need distraction”

Look

**police officer 00:05:00.94** 

""It's alleged that the ring would recruit individuals into Canada. Once in Canada they would claim refugee status
Now just in case you're not clear about this

**police officer 00:05:32.51**

 ""All the indications are that the 400 people we're aware of are Roma.""  

**Ezra Levant 00:05:40.41** 

Roma. Cops, as you know. But it's what some people call Gypsies. You can call them whatever they like if they're arresting them. It's fine by me. Here's another clip.  police officer 00:05:46.91 
""We have arrested and charged 29 people and have warrants out for six more. The total charges to date add up to 263. This is the…""  

**Ezra Levant 00:05:58.71** 

Twenty-nine people

Here's one. Quote

Here's another quote

Here's another one

And finally, and oversized and additional luggage filled with items acquired in Canada such as toys, clothing, and laptops.  

**Ezra Levant 00:07:13.94** 

Look! So you've got refugee fraud. Then you've got fraud fraud - you know

They're gypping us! Sorry

And women and children

Remember what I told you on Friday. In Milan,000 euros a month! And Italian police could do nothing since they were all young kids. Stealing is part of their family crime organization.

**Ezra Levant 00:07:43.41** 

Being Gypsy isn't like being Black, or even Romanian, where many Gypsies come from - just like being from Sicily doesn't make you part of the Mafia. Being Gypsy is a positive choice. Like being a Blood or a Crip. Like joining the Cosa Nostra. 

For centuries these roving highway gangs have mocked the law and robbed their way across Europe. 

And now, and they've brought a Gypsy crime wave with them.  

**Ezra Levant 00:08:14.58** 

Yeah. No thanks. I'm not interested in calling them Roma

Hah! The social workers will just have their wallets stolen. 

I want to dispatch cops

Just warn the flight attendants

This is the subject of a controversial post made and removed in this sub earlier today. Each of the 5 goals in this pamphlet are sort of wordy and vague, and if you have corrections then please expand on them.

1. The government needs to apologize for ""the full range of colonial institutions""

2. The government needs to enact legislation which exempts First Nations from all laws of Canada

3. The government must give up all levels of control over First Nations economies, leadership, land, etc. (This would follow automatically if #2 was granted tough, right?)

4. The government must completely fund whatever laws and policies are enacted by the First Nations people

5. The government must give First Nations rights to negotiate on everything. (If they are demanding veto rights

The reason a huge red banner appears when you hover over the downvote button is because we are trying very hard to discourage its misuse. The basic rules of rediquette, the end result is to silence dissent and to turn this subreddit into a one-sided sounding board. This has been the fate of a *large number* of subreddits, and we don't want /r/canadapolitics to go the same route.

So again: please base your decision to downvote on *whether the comment contributes to the discussion or violates the subreddit's rules*, please *explain why*.

1359412370.0,17gfnx,Sundry announcements and a request for feedback,h1ppophagist,42,4,100,"Greetings to all from the mods of /r/CanadaPolitics. 

First off, and a fourth with Jane Sterk, leader of the Green Party of British Columbia. We're all really excited to be hosting such interesting people here.

In the month of December, and both of them offer us an opportunity to look back at where our subreddit has been and look ahead to where all of us think it should be going.

Here is an imgur album with a few graphs and charts of our subreddit in 2012: http://imgur.com/a/sfBuq

As impressive as our growth has been, respectful and enjoyable - in spite of the tendency of subreddits to become one-sided 'echo chambers'. We, the moderating team, are happy to do our part in maintaining this, but really it's the commitment to user moderation that our best and most cherished users have that makes the difference: the application of a simple set of submission guidelines, written before this subreddit had even 500 subscribers and still effective with a userbase ten times that amount.

It's everybody's hope that (a) the subreddit will continue to grow, in a strange way, that we're doing something right. Yet we're certainly fallible and acknowledge that there might be faults in our moderation approach - faults that we'd appreciate your calling to our attention. So let us know: what do you think of the moderation practices here? Is there anything that you think should be done differently? We'd love to hear your thoughts. 
 
The other thing we'd like your help with is generating new content. To that end

First, but we'd really appreciate any ideas anyone here might have for future AMA guests, or - even better - leads on how to reach these people.

Second, where users make self-posts featuring 'resolutions', much like bills put to parliament, that we could then discuss in the comments. An example might be something like the following: ""Be it resolved that, upon the death of Her Majesty Elizabeth II or her abdication from the throne, the position of head of state be taken by a Canadian-born Canadian citizen either elected or appointed to the role for a term lasting no more than five years."" We'd love to hear your feedback about this idea and, if it's well received

5, both in terms of volume of content and in terms of how far and wide we get noticed. Hopefully we'll keep growing at this same pace, but further growth offers new opportunities and new risks in equal measure. Here's hoping everyone's committed to keeping the tone we all value so much here, and here's hoping everyone's on the same page about how to best do that. As moderators, we are proud and honoured to have 5,000 of reddit's best users grace our pages here. It's you who make this such a great little corner of reddit.

Thanks!

Marc would like to see a wide-scale broadband policy implemented, (maybe European or American telecommunications companies) then a public-private partnership may be possible.  As Marc has repeatedly said, if we want to grow the knowledge economy then we have to make strategic investments in the infrastructure that supports that economy. 
 
I wish that we could have a completely costed out package ready for you, fire me off your ideas...we'd love to hear them!
 
Also, I encourage you to do so at https://marcgarneau.ca/supporter/
 
If you are signed up as a supporter already, March 14th.  You should have received a registration notice from the Liberal Party by now...if you haven’t, fire them off an email at  info@liberal.ca
 
Once again
 
All the best
