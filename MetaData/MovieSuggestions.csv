What do I mean by ""features OST prominently"" or ""soundtrack at forefront""?

Smart, creepy, human, uniquely Pedro Almodóvarian, but most importantly it's one of those movies that doesn't just pass through you like water. It takes a while to digest, and that makes it all the more great. Definitely one of my favourites of 2011.

So I had this idea to do a suggestion series of sorts.

I would suggest a double or triple feature for you guys to spend a night on. I suppose if you had seen one or two of them

NOW TO THE MOVIES!

We start the night with The Maltese Falcon.

A true classic. Almost film perfection
I can't tell you much more because I don't want to spoil it

Next up is Chinatown.

This Roman Polanski epic has a truly captivating plot carried by Jack Nicholson and his fantastic acting. Definitely not for the feint of heart: it has a fearsome run-time of over two hours that is not always exhilarating

Lastly

This star-studded film is an excellent study of multiple, budding cop with ideals that seem set-in-stone.

You guys helped me out in a big way about a month ago with my [rather specific request](http://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/comments/124iqq/request_foreign_actioncrime_noir_flicks/) for foreign action/vigilante movies. I spent a great deal of time browsing Amazon's DVD/Bu-Ray market place because of that thread. Lots of adrenaline gone to waste in an arm chair and about $150 later: I now have a respectable action movie collection from overseas. My wallet hates you guys but my CD rack is looking quite full




[Hyper-Violence!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=uI-V0rrlZBo#t=32s) This is the stuff I'm looking for! Brutality, etc. I'm aware that The Raid is currently the end-all-be-all for gritty violence. I'll take whatever you guys can throw me at me that's similar. Doesn't matter what language it's in, or the year it came out. I watched damn near everything in that last thread and a few stuck out:



- [Merantau](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1368116/)   - the movie overall was quite mediocre. The combat



- [13 Assassins](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1436045/)  - I almost didn't watch this movie because it started so slowly



- [Oldboy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364569/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)  - Thanks to /u/Bane18 for suggesting this one. I wasn't sure what to make of this movie at the start and I almost felt like I was going to be disappointed. Random fellow picked off the street and held hostage = action movie? Meh...I didn't see how it could work out. But then everything took a twist into WTF land and heads started breaking. Wonderful movie.


- [Cleanskin](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1598873/)  - I'm a big fan of Sean Bean and the British in general, you get smiles. A thanks to /u/sven_hoek for that suggestion.



Excepting the movies Mother, The Guard, and Once Upon a Time in Anatolia, I watched every movie in that last thread. So whatever suggestions you guys have for me this time, please note my wallet hates you all, but I've been having a blast on the weekends marathoning these and I appreciate the time several of you have put into keeping this sub active-despite the presence of useless lurkers like me.

Wasn't it great how the surviving ninjas spent the rest o the movie getting righteous revenge against him for - Wait

[BORN TO FIGHT](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0428725/) - From the lunatic masochists who brought you ONG BAK comes the most ridiculously awesome movie ever made. When Burmese terrorists armed with a nuclear missile invade a small border village in Thailand, Rugby-fu, Hackey Sack-fu, and good old-fashioned Muy Thai to bring down the terrorists in a fist-pumping, jingoistic explosion that lasts 45 minutes and looks like it cost the lives of hundreds of stunt men. 

[BLOOD AND BONE](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0346631/) - Starring THE DARK KNIGHT's Michael Jai White as an enigmatic Badass motherfucker who teams up with Rufio from HOOK to bring down a mob boss by competing in underground street fights. With a surprisingly well-developed villain, this is 90 straight to video minutes you'll be glad you watched. 

[THE TOURNAMENT](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0471041/) - All the world's greatest assassins compete in a last-man-standing fight to the death. And it's awesome. Starring Ving Rhames as Ving Rhames, Scott Adkins, and Ian Summerholder as a cowboy who collects trigger fingers. Ooh! And Robert Carlyle as a priest. 

[UNIVERSAL SOLDER: REGENERATION](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1288403/) - Definitely not what you'd expect from this franchise. After five goofy popcorn films, with brutal, unglamorized violence. The story, as it is, is pared down to such a simple level as to feel like background to the strange, inexorably tragic atmosphere.
