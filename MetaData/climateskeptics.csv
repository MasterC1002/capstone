/u/moirende makes a point that I think bears repeating.  So I'm posting it in this karma-neutral text post.

From [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/climateskeptics/comments/r653g/time_to_take_out_the_trash/c43fxvw?context=3):

&gt;...

&gt;The simple truth is, or wants to.

&gt;This sub-reddit is for those who are skeptical about AGW alarmism and want to talk about that. The pro-AGW folks who come here do so specifically to drown out the skeptical people they disagree with. They use all sorts of tactics to stifle debate

&gt;There are a number of pro-AGW supporters who frequent this sub who engage in civil discussion and add content to the debate. *Nobody has suggested they be banned.* I would further say that anyone who wants to come here and have a civil debate is more than welcome.

&gt;But the trolling needs to stop.

The term ""empirical evidence"" has been flung around here a lot lately but you should know what you're actually supporting.

You're supporting an hypothesis. Not only are you advocating an hypothesis as fact but you're advocating an hypothesis which is supported primarily by computer models. Rail and rant, deny and lie to yourselves all you wish you can not change these two simple truths:

Climate sensitivity is unknown. Despite all of the man hours and all of the dollars we have spent trying to estimate it our best efforts are just that - estimates. 

The effects of warming are unknown. Even *if* climate sensitivity is 3C we have no reason to believe that a warming globe will be catastrophic in any way. This hypothesis is supported by the output of computer models. Computer models are not evidence.

I'd also like to mention that the reasons for supporting these hypotheses grow weaker every day

Ours is the first form of civilization that has been able to move beyond those restraints. Nevertheless, this implies very real limits to reduction of energy use by way of efficiency. Efficiency improvements are already finding the tail of the law of diminishing returns.

I think it would be pretty uncontroversial to state that rich nations would like to remain rich and poor nations would like to become rich. In order for these two things to happen, not reduction in energy use.

Consider energy consumption in the U.S. In 2010

To transition to another source of energy in a short time period would be an undertaking of almost unimaginable proportions. Neither nuclear power nor renewables (especially not renewables) could accomplish it alone. Aside from biofuels

Further, and the Interstate Highway System combined. (For this little hypothetical we must also pretend our national debt does not exceed GDP, that we do not have a large generation retiring and consuming more federal services, and that we are not throwing another $trillion per year on the national credit card.) Suppose this project could actually be pulled off. The end result? More expensive energy. The result of more expensive energy? Reduced competitiveness in global markets and a perpetual drag on GDP growth. Remember, rich nations want to stay rich. Would an ethereal threat that maybe something bad might happen 100 years from now salve the pain of transition and permanent reduction in wealth and status thereafter? Probably not.

Perhaps now you understand why I shake my head at the terribly naive-sounding suggestion that we'll just legislate emissions reductions into existence. Such a suggestion shows a complete lack of sophistication when it comes to finance, and the laws of thermodynamics and exhibits a religious, if misplaced, faith in the power of government. California is a great example. No single utility in that weird state met the mandate of 20% renewables by 2010, so the logical thing for that government to do was to legislate a mandate of 33% of energy from renewables by 2020. Delusion, thy name is California.
