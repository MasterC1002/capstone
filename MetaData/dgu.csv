Just wanted to give you a quick update:
 
Last night Side Pockets had a 'robbery' as two men entered demanded money then fled on foot. Even with Officers on the scene they fled and escaped capture. (See Herald Mail Article Link &gt;&gt;&gt;) Police Seek Two in Robbery
 
I want you to know the rest of the story:
 
A little before 11pm while cleaning our Laundry across the street at 812 South Potomac Street in Hagerstown
 
In that quick second glance I saw the one now added a white piece of cloth around his neck that was covering from his nose to his hoodie. That really struck me as odd
 
As I went to put her in the passenger side door I realized with only one door lock I had to 'Unlock ALL Doors' to let her in. With them setting less than 15 foot from the drivers door I realized that this could be a robbery or car jacking going to happen. 
 
Before unlocking the doors I unsnapped the holster on my 45ACP Kimber Ultra Compact Semi-Auto handgun and pulled my coat back. I realized if they went for the drivers side doors I would only have a second or two to pull my wife out to safety and draw my weapon. Lucky for me they did not move.
 
Next I would need to get within 10 feet from them to enter the Tahoe and lock the doors. I placed my hand on the Kimber and slowly walked around the Tahoe from the front. As I looked at them they were looking at me
 
When I was at a safe distance I then called the Hagerstown Police Dispatch and asked them to keep an eye on the Laundry and reported the two young men and their actions. I was informed by the Dispatch Desk that there was now Officers on the scene for a Side Pockets Tavern Robbery across the street. I then went back and checked the surveillance tape. The one suspect matched the closest man to me in the light colored hoodie and hat that had walked past my Laundry at Closing time watching us.
 
Please add this to my letter opposing additional Firearms Regulations when you go to the upcoming meetings. Please let everyone know that you don't need to use a handgun or firearm to stop crime. Sometimes just being prepared will make a criminal choose a different path to take.
 
Also please thank the Maryland State Police and Past Legislators that passed the laws for allowing me to be one of the few Maryland Citizens that is allowed to carry a Registered Concealed Carry Handgun for Personal Protection. I hope someday 'ALL Legal Maryland Citizens' could apply for Handgun Permits and that new Handgun Permits will be reciprocal with other states.
 
I believe that having my Kimber ready and on my side last night kept me and my Wife from being Victims of Violent Crime once again.....
 
Sincerely
 
Doy C. Sneckenberger

I'm finding plenty of ""feel good"" DGU stories where the gun owner protected his life and his property either by shooting and wounding or killing the bad guy, and sites like gunssavelives.net don't show those stories because its opposite of their point, and I understand that. 

So I'm looking for stories where someone attempted to use their gun to defend themselves or others
