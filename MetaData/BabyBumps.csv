1367938934.0,1dv4xs,My thoughts about personal safety on a public forum such as Reddit,not_really_a_nerd,290,33,54,"Hey ladies! So

This is the Internet. Everything you post is public, nobody is really going to use that against you. However, I have seen lots of people post ultrasound pictures with their full names, then on their user profile you can see other posts saying where they live and how old they are, sometimes along with photos of them, their SO, and their new little one. Ladies, but there are nearly 8000 people on this subreddit

For instance, and your other posts have info regarding your city, your age, and so on, it would be really easy for someone to steal your child’s identity. Social Security numbers are partially created from this personal information such as your city/zip code. I don’t want to cause fear, but I honestly think some people don’t realize the risk behind sharing such personal details on the Internet. I can’t tell you how many people I’ve been able to find on Facebook just from what I’ve seen them post on Baby Bumps.  If it's easy to get to your FB, imagine all the personal info that is posted there, but someone who is can get a lot of info about you from what you post. Please be aware and be cautious!

Edit: As evidenced by the people who are commenting in this thread, not just Bumpers! Also, what you post on the Internet is permanent, and hitting ""delete"" doesn't make it go away. Deleting old posts can somewhat get rid of personal information (or at least make it harder to find), but it still exists in cyber space somewhere.

I stumbled upon this subreddit today and had to stop and marvel at the amount of information, Male to female), and as such, there is currently no amount of science, surgery, or money that could enable me to become pregnant. For me this is very, very depressing. Even if they were somehow able to equip me for it, maybe two. I have names picked out.

 I have nights where it's all I can do to not bawl my eyes out. I love to listen to to the stories and experiences of anyone, in terms of gender identity and sexuality, I am a lesbian, which brings to the table it's own complications in the area of baby making.) But alas, I have no one who meets both the criteria of A. knowing what I am going through and B. being pregnant.

""You have twins!"" she announced. I don't remember my exact reaction, then says, ""It's funny you mention it. Here's baby number three.""

Nothing coherent came out of my mouth for the next few hours. I'd thought that maybe... *maybe* the odds were in my favor to have twins at some point because my grandmother had two sets

I was sent down for blood work and a second ultrasound. The former I'd expected

There was also an ovary with what looked like two separate compartments and bloodflow running through it oddly. The tech kindly explained how it all worked, but this time one of the fertilized eggs split on the way down!

* Your milk will take anywhere from 3-10 days to come in. The baby's tummy is the size of a marble, focus on getting a good latch and figuring out what positions may work best for you.

* Anyone who says it won't hurt is lying, but soreness is normal. You're having someone suck on your boobs for up to a few hours at a time, which most people don't have happen. Yeah, it's going to hurt, but after 10 days/2 weeks or so, it does get better. Letdown stings in the beginning, but you will get used to it. Just breath through it

* ASK FOR HELP!!!! Find a good online community, subreddit, or hell, PM me. There IS support out there, so take full advantage of it. 

* Know that there are 2 kinds of breastmilk: foremilk and hindmilk. Foremilk is thin and watery and comes out first, the part your baby will use most to grow. If you pump and put it in the fridge, the milk will separate. Totally normal. Just swirl (don't shake) it around and it will mix back together. Don't microwave it either, run the bag/bottle under warm water to warm it back up. 

* Pumping is not how you tell if you're producing enough milk. The best way to tell is by looking at your baby. Is it gaining weight and growing? Does it have 6-8 wet diapers, if those things are true, your baby is getting enough. Also, don't freak out if your baby starts to poop less as it ages. Around 6 weeks (for us) my son went from 2-3 poopy diapers/day to 1/week. It's normal for an EBF (exclusively breastfed baby) to go 10 days without pooping, because there just isn't a lot of waste from digesting breastmilk, so it can take awhile to build up.

* Know that there is actually a WHO growth chart specifically for breastfed babies. You can google it, as long as my child is meeting developmental milestones and is growing consistently on it's own curve, I don't really care what the other chart says.

* [kellymom.com](http://www.kellymom.com) Like it

* If you've tried everything and it's just not working, that baby needs to eat, and compared to what they used to feed babies (beer and soggy bread? really?), formula is a serious upgrade. **You did your best, now feed your baby and be at peace.**

If baby is born today our family birth dates will be 4th, 27th, 28th... if tomorrow, 4th, 14th... 25th, 26th, 27th

As things ramp up

**Update 2**: Moving along steadily. But this is just how I do it. It'll probably still be several hours until I get to the really tough stuff. For now

**Update 3**: Asked hubby to finish up what he needs to do at work at come home. The contractions are getting very uncomfortable and by the time he gets here I'll need his support through them if they keep progressing like this.

**Update 4**: Hubby is home. Family has been notified. Midwife is still waiting for our call (not quite time yet) and babysitter and photographer are both on stand-by now. Contractions are something like 10 minutes apart and fairly long. I'm to a point I hit every pregnancy where during a contraction

To pass time

**Update 5**: Just fixed sticky at top of page.

Good timing

**Update 6**: 8 hours in. Still early labor. Needs to hurry up and progress.

**Update 7**: Okay getting stronger

**Update 8**: SergeantJinto here (hubby :D). Midwife is on the way

**Update 9**: Hubby here again. Midwife is here, 0 to -1 station, bulging bag of waters @ 11:00 PM EST. WOOOOOO!

1368380159.0,1e6xkb,Things that surprised me about labor,bumpinseattle,218,26,47,"Hey! So
Labor was rough, and it was absolutely beautiful. There are a few things that happened during and after the process that I wasn't really expecting, though. And I'd like to share those with you. These things aren't the same for everyone, and I can't say with all certainty that any or all of these things will be at all applicable to you, but I'd like to share them anyway. Just, you know, in case and stuff =)  




1. How **long** it is!  
I knew that labor lasts a while, is the *labor* that goes into labor! I was in true, active, consistent labor from 8:30 in the morning on Thursday through 5:44 in the morning on Saturday. It was laborious, it was straining, and it was absolutely exhausting. Things are progressive, and your pain threshold does increase with every growing contraction

2. Modest is hottest
Seriously. All my plans about bringing my own gown, it just doesn't matter. Giving birth for me was a very instinctual, almost animalistic experience. What mattered was getting through the pain and getting the baby out. I farted. I pooped. I pulled my hair back into a super-tight ponytail with sweaty chunks of hair popping out everywhere. I sweat, I bled, and I ultimately had a baby. When it was all said and done, the only part that mattered was the last part. I don't look back with any embarrassment or regret, because everything that happened is what is supposed to happen during labor.  

3. Recovery time is so necessary.  
After a full day of labor, and nursing a ""very small"" peri-urethral tear, so every time I need to use the restroom, it's a giant mess and quite a bit of pain. For the first 8 hours or so after labor, I couldn't remember how to pee. After so much pushing and trauma, my muscles were out of whack and I forgot how to access the one that let me pee. I eventually figured it out, and am doing fine now, but no matter your situation

4. How quickly certain things reset in your body.  
That horrendous rib pain I had my entire pregnancy from Eleanor slamming her feet up there? Gone immediately. My inability to take in a full breath of air because of my squished-up lungs? No more. My instant fullness after 2 bites of full because nothing fit in my stomach? Definitely not a problem! So many of the things that had become such a normal inconvenience for me through the last 9 months of my life were instantly dealt with. Sure, but there's also a lot that returns to almost normal quite quickly. My uterus shrank up really quickly, and is now starting to look almost not pregnant at all, and the skin around my belly and hips is not nearly as ""goopy"" as I was anticipating... and has already started to regain its form! Sure, it may be partly a vanity thing, but it's also just really nice to see that my body knows what it's doing, and is so quickly recovering from such a huge change.  

5. It's totally okay to over-prepare.  
Have a snoogle? Bring it. Laptop? Take it with you. Favorite teddy? Go for it. Sure, you'll be glad you have it. We ended up staying in the hospital for an extra day after delivery due to wonky kidney function levels, and it would've been nice to have something to make it feel a bit more homey  and comfortable. We've always been the ""less is more"" type couple, but less body wash is only more gross. Seriously, don't be afraid of being over-prepared. It's much better than being under-prepared!  


Basically, nothing can truly prepare you for everything that comes with it. But you can do it. You can, and you will. This subreddit has been so helpful in preparing me for childbirth and early motherhood, and it's been amazing to share this experience with you ladies. If there's any sort of light I can shine for you on any subject, let me know. I'm happy to offer any insight I can based off of my own personal experience. Your labor will be different from mine, and everyone else's,  but again,,False,t3_1e6xkb

When I was pregnant and active on babybumps  I loved to read the birth stories and everything from the great beyond. I loved the wiggle worm in my tummy so much and I loved to feel him move around and flop. I was going to miss that so much after he was born, pushed through 3 contractions and he was here! All 22 inches and 6 pounds of him. And I felt... nothing. 

I confided to my husband as we were left alone in the birthing room to bond that I didn't feel anything. I don't know that I would jump in front of a moving bus for him, and let's reassess in the morning. So, I didn't really eat anything, couldn't really sleep, but did send Mr. Man to the nursery so I could try to sleep! Woke up the next morning, and... nothing still. I had feelings, definitely, everything you're going through is SO worth it"" and ""I have never loved anything more in my entire life"". I totally expected the same. I had those feelings when I was gestating him

It wasn't until I embarrassingly confessed to a friend that I didn't have that feeling immediately. And I really didn't until about 8 weeks old. (this week mark keeps changing as I get further out and forget when things changed) Friend told me she was the same

So, and sometimes maybe for just a day or two. Others, like me, it took a couple of months. And now, that little boy is amazing. Don't feel like something is wrong! But now, as the mother of a 19 week old, I can tell you IT'S TOTALLY WORTH IT! ;)

Edit: Just wanted to say that I love other people chiming in and sharing their same feelings! I hope it is reassurance for first time moms and dads who may go through this in the very near future!

1354742082.0,14cdxl,The (very long) story of our loss at 21 weeks,aislinnanne,216,37,116,"I'd like to start this with a warning. This is an honest, my experience terminating my pregnancy late in my pregnancy. This may be hard for some to read. It may make some people angry. I am sharing this because I have been asked to by several people and because, but expect no response from me. I am at peace with our decision and eager to bring a healthy life into this world. If you feel this will trigger anything for you

As many of you may have read, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles appeared to be fused. They said it was similar to [arthrogryposis (also referred to as AMC)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthrogryposis) but in reverse (most fetuses with AMC present with limbs in flexion, he was in full extension).

We decided to hold off on any decisions until we got a second opinion so they did an amnio and got us scheduled us another appointment. The following Monday we headed to another hospital and were told that it was definitely AMC and that it not only affected his limbs but also his spine and jaw. Basically every joint in his body was immobile. 

The doctors were very clear about what this meant. *If* he survived birth (which they weren't sure he could), come to terms with earlier in the week-we would be terminating this pregnancy. 

Now to add insult to injury. Since there is a ban on federally funded abortions, that's better than the hospital, so we booked an appointment. In the meantime, they suggested I contact the [Eastern Massachusetts Abortion Fund](http://emafund.org/). This organization is truly wonderful. If you know anyone in New England struggling to pay for an abortion, please refer them here. They suggested, if we were able, to look into going to NY to Parkmed. It was only $1250 and that is only a 4 hour drive. We cancelled at Women's Health and got in Friday at Parkmed.

Showing up at the clinic they did an ultrasound and dated me at 21 weeks by then. It would be a two day procedure. On day one they would insert laminaria to dilate my cervix overnight and give me a saline injection in the uterus to terminate fetal life. The first day I was then put under general anesthesia. When I woke, my little boy was gone. We would never meet the baby we spent over a year trying to conceive. 

After they were satisfied I could walk, it wasn't painful. The laminaria are meant to slowly dilate my cervix and I expected that to be painful but it really wasn't. My heart, however, physically ached. 

The next morning we headed back to the clinic for day two. This time

For day two I was again put under anesthesia. This time I went under crying. I felt like I should have been able to protect my little boy. The baser part of myself felt like he was scared and I was a bad mother. I wanted him so much and when I woke up, but it was with the needle in my arm, as I fell asleep, that I came to terms with my loss and could  no longer control my emotions.

I woke up empty in every sense of the word. I can not remember ever feeling such a sense of loss and I would not wish this level of grief on anyone. I had no idea how much I loved the life inside me until he was gone. 

I also woke up in pain, and seemed to be bleeding much more than everyone else (they closed a privacy curtain every time they checked the pad you were sitting on). The medical staff at Parkmed was great in all ways but one: it was very hard to get information. I'm still not sure what was wrong with me. Once I was coherent enough to swallow without choking I was given some pain pills (though I don't know what they were) and that took the edge off but I was still shaking. About two hours later, I was asked if I thought I could walk to the bathroom. This, I had figured out from watching so many other women come and go, was the first step to getting discharged. I wanted to get discharged and be with my husband. Yes, I decided, I could go to the bathroom. 

In the bathroom they help you sit down and tell you to bear down like you're going number two. Don't wipe, and don't lock the door. 5 minutes later they came back, checked the toilet, cleaned me up (not kidding, I wasn't allowed to wipe my own vagina), and walked me to a chair where I got my first snack. It was 3:00pm and I hadn't eaten since 10:00pm the night before since I had to fast for the anesthesia so I was anticipating that cookie and dixie cup of ginger ale. 

Another 30 minutes, no intercourse, no anything in your vagina"" she repeated several times. I was warned to get on birth control immediately and explained for the 100th or so time that I had not *wanted* to terminate and that I would be getting pregnant again as soon as possible. 

Here I am, but overall, I'm doing better. My husband and I have had many long talks, made lots of bad, tasteless jokes, cried, hugged

I will see my midwife a week from today to check and make sure my uterus is back to normal. I'm hoping that she'll give me the go ahead to start trying again but I get the impression she thinks we should wait a few months. I'm doing as well as I can be but there is nothing that will make this hurt any less except getting past the anatomy scan in my next pregnancy. I don't want to delay that any more than I have to. I'm struggling significantly with my body image right now. I'm back to that point were nothing fits me right but instead of it being funny and cute, being a very private person, I'm not comfortable giving one. So, what I'm getting at is, I just want to be pregnant again so everyone can start to move on.

If you're still with me at this point in the story, reach out to me. I know everyone grieves differently and I would never presume to know *your* pain but I'm a good listener and I may be able to help you find resources if you need help. If you are still happily and healthfully pregnant, I am so very happy for you. I wish you nothing but joy.

So on the evening of May 1, enjoying my admittedly too-easy pregnancy.  The midwives I'd been seeing for a the past four months hadn't done any sort of cervical check yet, with no plans to do one until my due date on May 9.  My boyfriend, G, was at work, and would be until 5:30 A.M., but his mother (a paramedic) and daughter (age 8 – yay!  I'd made it past her birthday on April 28) were home and asleep.  At about eleven I started feeling mild crampiness, but I shrugged it off and continued to play Super Paper Mario.  After a while the cramps became timeable, G would probably be off work by the time things started to ramp up.  My mom wishing a twenty-six hour labor on me was fresh in my mind
The contractions (or pressure waves, but they did start to smart after a while. Hypnobabies wasn't doing a thing for me, though rolling my hips, singing and showering went a long way towards helping, but soon enough all I was doing was writhing around on the bed – it felt oddly good.  I noticed they were evening out, all of a sudden, towards being five minutes apart, telling him not to leave work

I felt nauseous.  I was like, but I was only in there for like twenty minutes, and anyway, even if there's a gush, isn't there a trickle afterward?  So I'm like nah.  I felt ferociously thirsty and started chugging water in the bathroom, waiting for vomit to come, but that feeling was suddenly overridden by the urge to push!  And I start feeling bad about the whole thing at this point.  I know I should have called an ambulance instead of trying to make it to the hospital, “Please come, but sometimes I couldn't fight it

When G got home, understandably, freaked out by the sounds that had awoken her, though his daughter slept like a baby.  We decided they'd follow us to the hospital a little later, and we set off, with me laying on my side in the backseat, feet propped on the front passenger seat and headrest, the contractions had been worse right before transition.  What I didn't expect – though I'd read about it in all sorts of birth stories, I realized something was emerging, but G has said he knew I was being ridiculous.  The baby had been head down for a month or more

The baby was chill and peering around by the time we pulled into the emergency room parking lot.  There were, but when they saw we were okay they were calm, and even let G cut the cord (it was bizarre looking!) standing outside the back passenger door.  A doctor took my son and I was helped onto a bed (I deliberately did not look behind me at the towel on the seat, but I've seen the blood stains that got through to the seat itself and they're not so bad – a bitch to detail, but not so bad), and they were kind enough to give me back my son to hold against my body as they wheeled me through the hospital to labor and delivery – no need for the emergency room.  I was grinning like a fool the whole time.  Two women helped distract me by trying to get him to nurse, while a doctor stitched up my second degree tear.  The birth certificate lady had quite a time figuring out what to put down for who delivered him (can't be the mother in our state, that doctor at the ER) and where he was born (since we didn't stop the car, despite my recklessness

I really thought I was going to get my comeuppance for having such an easy birth, but his bloodwork was normal and they even let him go home with me on schedule, instead of keeping him for two extra days for observation, as they'd warned me.  I really can't believe I got so lucky.  I didn't do anything to deserve that luck, and as a result I have the gnawing fear that my next pregnancy and birth will be a nightmare, so for now I'm holding my baby and not thinking about the future, or the past.  I just know we love him.

Good luck to all y'all lovely ladies

TL;DR Five hour labor, 19 inches, strep anxiety, everything's awesome :)

Cut to Sun morning. We wake up and he says that he is just going to go shopping for breakfast type things and will be back soon. I figure, its gunna be in bed. So I rolled over and went back to sleep.

I didn't wake up until I heard his car pull up in the drive and his door close. I hear him come inside carrying bags and I get out of bed to go pee.

As I walk round the corner in the hallway I walk straight into my mother!!!!

He didn't go to the shops at all! He had gone to the airport to get my mum who has flown from Sydney to visit for the week as a surprise!!!

Best surprise ever considering how homesick I have been lately (see my last thread I posted here).

He organised for her to come

We haven't seen eachother since December so she was excited to see my big belly and is taking lots of photos to show my dad.

1375343504.0,1jhce2,Logan's Non-Medicated Vaginal Birth Story (long but pics!),RayningAcid,197,32,50,"Forgive me if this is in broken sentences, and had some monitoring done.  It was the first time I’d been hooked up to a monitor for an extended period of time

A midwife gave me a cervical exam (yay for being in the UK, the doctor’s name who had done it, and that it had no effect.  She smiled and said there was no way, as my cervix was high and not dilated at all, there was no way a doctor could have reached the membranes.  She inserted some medicine called “Propess”, which looked like a flat tampon, complete with a string.  The whole thing goes up into your business

After the Propess was inserted, the midwife and the doctor who had “performed” the membrane sweep the week before came in.  She apologised for not putting me in labor, and behind her the nurse was trying VERY hard not to laugh at the doctor, which made it hard for me not to laugh at the doctor as well.  The ultrasound was fine, and I was sent home, with instructions to come back for additional monitoring at 18:30. 

Around 2 in the afternoon the contractions started. By 18:00, lay down and be monitored.  It was very hard to lay on the cot for the 30 minutes as the contractions were very close together.  I ended up crying for most of it, and my poor husband tried to make the midwife understand that she should check me. Midwife said first baby,so go home, and not to come in unless-now you’re not reading this wrong but I’m going to all caps it as this is relevant later-THE CONTRACTIONS LAST 120 SECONDS EVERY FIVE MINUTES FOR AN HOUR.  She even wrote this in my maternity notes (in the UK, this is like a part of your chart that you carry with you until the delivery).  I couldn’t stop crying, between pain and anger.  She asked me why I hadn’t taken anything for the pain,and sent me home.

By the time I go home I was angry, I took a shower, and typed some angry things to my supportive friends in a Facebook group. They kept me sane until we decided to go to bed around midnight.

Husband was able to fall right asleep, and I wasn't going to go up to the hospital. Around 3am, I decided that sleep just wasn't going to happen, and I'd just get up and tough it out til the appointment .  Took a shower, and then spent some quality time sitting on the toilet, where my waters broke, and it felt like the Propess fell out. I stopped timing the contractions, and eff that midwife

At 7am, dressed, and called the cab in record time.  We made it to the hospital about 7:30 am.  Up the elevator to the labor ward, but oh no I’m sorry, it’s after hours we need you to go to triage. Back down the elevator and across the hospital to triage we went.  I could barely walk, and the woman in triage said I had to lay down and let the baby be monitored.  This just wasn’t an option, I REALLY needed something for pain, until finally she said fine

I layed on the exam table, I guess she is in pain”.  They called for the anesthesiologist as it was planned for me to have an epidural, and handed me some sort of tube that had “gas and air”.  I threw this tube down because it was heavy and I wanted to squeeze the bed. The anesthesiologists were quick about getting there, but I was unable to sit the way they wanted on the bed.  This was the same for the monitoring they wanted to do.  I ended up telling everyone to fuck off.  Yes, I was the lady who swore.  I believe the words were IF YOU’RE NOT GIVING ME A SHOT OF STADOL OR MORPHINE, LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE, I CANNOT SIT ON THE FUCKING BED WITH MY LEGS STRAIGHT OUT. They repeatedly asked me to take the gas and air since I was in so much pain, I’ll go unmedicated.  

At 8:20 I ripped the monitors off and insisted that I was going to go pee, I had the urge to push.  The midwife starts yelling RAYNINGACID YOUR CHILD DESERVES NOT TO BE BORN IN THE BATHROOM!! and I had to agree with that.  I went and knelt beside the bed, for a minute, while some other midwife came in and told me to climb back in the bed on my hands and knees, it would make the baby come closer.  I told this midwife to fuck herself, I’d give birth how I wanted, and get out of my room.  The husband helped me climb back in bed at 8:30.

The remaining midwife (had managed not to kick ONE person out of the room...woo! Go me!) said perhaps I should give that a try, July 25.  I opened my eye just in time to see it.  He didn’t come out gracefully. Think of a cannon.  He literally shot across the bed.  It looked like the midwife was playing trying to catch a ball that she was unsure of where the landing point was.  She said she hadn’t seen anything like it before, and I tried to make a joke about how he was Wolverine and he’d come out how he wanted to.  One push, second degree tear, not bad!

1351796827.0,12gztm,Zahara's Birth Story,JustForCancer,204,42,52,"Wow... I knew I would have an experience to remember and that I did.

Monday Night:

I had been having braxton hicks for weeks and a few strong contractions thrown in here and there.  I decided I wanted out of the house so me

Tuesday:  

All day contractions very irregular.  For a while we got contractions going 3-4 minutes apart and about a minute in length.  Right as I'm getting ready to go to the hospital I notice they are getting further and further apart.  Then stopped.  Annoying?  Yes

Me, and Cashion all played rounds of UNO hoping the contractions would kick up again but they never did.  That was until about 7:00pm at night I text messaged my Doula letting her know that nothing was happening and that I was going to sleep.  Literally a few minutes after sending that text there was a soft ""POP"" in my abdomen followed IMMEDIATELY but insane pain.   I didn't even realize the pain was contractions because they were on top of each other and LONG.  I scream for Cashion to help me get to the car and everyone is scrambling to get going after just getting ready to go to sleep.  I'm in the passenger seat of the car trying to breath through the pain and I loose my plug and have my bloody show right there.  Within a minute there is fluid leaking out little by little as well.  All within about 3 minutes from the POP noise.

Cashion hauls ass to the hospital freaking out because he sees I'm in so much pain I can't even respond to him.  The contractions felt like someone was ripping my abdomen muscles out of body.  I've always had strong period cramps and thought contractions would be an exaggerated form of that... but seriously... these were difficult to even breath through let alone talk.

We get to the hospital, the thought of sitting at the time was awful to me so I gripped the walls and moved little by little to the ""First Stage Room"".  This is small room I had picked out to labor in that had a bathroom in it but was mainly used for storage.  They set up a bed in there and everything while I sat on the toilet making animalistic noises.

Finally they give me a cervical check after about 30 minutes and she tells me I'm only 1-2 cm dilated and the baby's head is at 4 stage which apparently is the highest up possible.  This was the first time I wanted to cry.  I didn't know how much more of the pain I could take.

They get my doctor in to see me and I'm just standing with my legs spread rocking back and forth leaning on the bed.  The doctor said that I'm probably going to have a slow labor, for now I could thought I could handle it.  He said he was going back home to rest up and to call if things progress.  This was the second time I almost cried.

Pacing back and forth, nothing helped with the pain, and they were consistently 2 minutes apart for about 4 more hours.  Finally the nurse came back to check on my progress.  I can't even lay down I'm in so much pain, and I'm about to lose my shit on the nurse who is not paying attention to that 2 minute window she has to check me between contractions.  She checks me and shakes her head and says ""I'm sorry... Mia Kapalamula, you are still 1 1/2 cm dilated and station 4, the baby has not moved down.""  This is the third time I almost cried.  I asked for the pain med injection.  I don't remember what it is but they said it ""might"" take a little edge off.

After the injection the only different I noticed is my body's urge to try and sleep during that 1 1/2 minute window between contractions.  The contractions felt exactly the same.  It completely wore off after 45 minutes and I was told I could not have another injection for another 6 hours.  I was also told there would be no other method of pain relief.

The vacation Doctor:

I was told that the option to have an epidural would be available a week before.  After being told there was no progress and that no other pain relief was available

My mom...

At this point I hadn't slept for 2 days because of prior contractions and had been hit with these contractions every 1 1/2 minutes for the past 8 hours and it took the turn for the worst.  I don't know if it was my body giving out on me or if they were progressing but I started screaming for my mom during the contractions.  Like a little girl that is hurt and wants her mom to make it better and it brought my mom to tears and I just gripped onto her as hard as I could and this was the first time I actually cried.  I told finally told her ""Mom I can't do this anymore."" She kept telling me ""Yes you can

My mom helped walk me to the shower since the contractions threw me down to my knees each time and the warm water provided the most brief sensation of relief.  It was what I needed to get me through the next 30 minutes before they checked me again for progress.

The Last Check:

There was no longer any space between my contractions, the pain is too much, she's not moving down, something's wrong something's wrong, over and and over.  My friend Heidi and my mom kept telling me I could do it, that my body was made for it, and I wish I could say I took it with grace and responded with class

The nurses had already been recommending a C Section because of the frequency and strength of the contractions without progress and said that I wouldn't even have the energy to push if the time every came.  Heidi did what I had asked her to do and fought the C Section conversation again and again until I finally told them ""I want it, that I could't do it, that there was something wrong and eventually everyone listened and within 30 minutes I was being wheeled into the surgical theater.  

I screamed the whole way

Somehow they got me up on the surgical bed and sitting upright.  Three nurses held me down as they proceeded to try and keep me still.  I don't think it was the contractions causing me to shake so vigorously... I mean it was cold and all but I was shaking violently, and the pain was so excruciating that I felt like I was blacking out at times.  Then finally... there was a tingle in my feet.... and then relief.  I felt no pain at all.  I almost instantly fell asleep.  I had no idea how tired my body was until I got that spinal block and my body for the first time in 12 hours was able to get a break.   This was also the first time I really questioned if I was doing the right thing... what if I selfishly took this as an ""out"" for the pain and am putting my baby in a worse position now?  What if my feeling of ""something is wrong"" is my mind finding an excuse to have a c section? I kept thinking, if something happens to her, I'll never forgive myself.  I know these are not the right things to think about, but after preparing for a natural birth and doing so much research ahead of time I couldn't help but feel like a complete failure.

This time I didn't call for my mom

I'm now at home, and had a bowel movement.  My mom, being in the medical field, couldn't help but want me out of there after witnessing horrible hygiene practices.  

The problem?

The doctor came in and let us know that her head was not sitting right down in the pelvis and that her little face was smushed up against it and that is why she had a big ol knot on her head.  Also there was a good amount of meconium all over her but luckily didn't get into her lungs.  I don't know if she would have ever come out naturally but I just didn't have it in me to go any further.  Maybe if I had some kind of pain relief but the old natural way?  I couldn't do it.

Zahara is having a hard time nursing but is slowly getting the hang of it.  She loves her fingers instead, her first day alive.  It was pretty comical to all the nurses and everyone at the hospital fell in love with her pretty quickly.  

I'm now sitting in bed, and I couldn't be happier.  

Cashion's Perspective:  For those of you that were not here months back

Here's to hoping I heal at home properly and thanks again to all the ladies that supported me throughout this entire journey.  I did take pictures but I don't want to get out of my net in the dark to go get the memory card right now.  Here are some my mom and Heidi took while I was in the recovery room after surgery:

Still had them around 7am when I got my boyfriend's daughter ready for school. By 9:30am the pain was becoming unbearable and I knew they weren't just Braxton Hicks.

Came to the hospital and they checked me. No blood, but I was screaming in pain. Eventually my doctor showed up and we did an ultrasound. At this point no heartbeat could be found, and I have never been in so much pain in my life.

He tells my boyfriend and I that I had a placental abruption but they have no idea why. There's nothing I could have done to prevent it

Was finally able to get an epidural around 3pm yesterday. I've been lying in this bed now for 15 hours waiting for labor to progress so I can deliver our baby.

I don't even know what emotion I'm feeling. I go back and forth. But really

I'm happy we got to spend the time together that we did. I'll miss his kicks and rolls and hearing his heartbeat. I guess it just wasn't my time to be a mom...

7cm now and should deliver within the next few hours. I just don't know what to do with myself...

I hope I can get through this.

SO went to their main HR lady and explained the situation to her and why he wanted that week off work...

I’m exactly 25 weeks along today! We found out they were all boys during our 18 week ultrasound

Baby A, flop and turn whenever he’s awake. Babies B &amp;amp; C I haven’t been able to feel more than a stray kick or elbow from since they've an anterior placenta, but I’ll listen to their movements and heartbeats with my doppler when I’m paranoid. Babies B &amp;amp; C are also smaller than their brother who has his own placenta. Last ultrasound, A was estimated at 1.7 lbs, while B was 1.4 and C 1.0. 

Baby C, though, he’s been growing appropriately albeit at a rate behind his siblings. If that stops happening, I’ll likely be sent to the hospital for continuous monitoring. 

The goal is still to make it to 35 weeks, they’re not pushing on my stomach too much, so I haven’t had too much issue stuffing my face. Double cheeseburger with bacon, anyone? :)

Friday was like any other day. I went to work and left to my weekly Dr. visit. I had one more visit on the 21st planned and then my scheduled c-section was on the 26th. I had noticed that the few days before my appt. I had felt a decrease in movement. I figured I was getting really big and he was losing space. I could still feel him change position from time to time

I laid there strapped to that machine and saw and heard his heart beat. His heart seemed strong and there was nothing wrong. After a half hour the Dr. came in and said that it showed little to no movement on the machine, but because I heard his heart beat I didn't think too far ahead. At the hospital, they get me hooked up to an IV which I thought was weird considering they just wanted to monitor me. The nurse hooked me up the same machine and watched it for another half hour. Everything looked fine. She said that they just wanted to see some movement. By then, the Dr. had come and she took a look at the test and told me not to drink any fluids in case I had to go in for surgery. I was totally freaked out at this point, because why would I need to go in for surgery if they kept reassuring me that everything was fine?

For hours they had me monitored and said his heart beat was perfect but that he wasn't really moving. I got up to give them a urine sample and when I lied back down

I looked at my husband and you could see the panic in his face. They rushed me to surgery. I didn't have time for a spinal so they put me under. I went to sleep not knowing what was going on or whether or not Xander was in danger.  I woke up. I woke up to 20 people standing around me and my husband sobbing

Edit: Thank you all so much for the heartfelt sympathies. It's been over a week and some days are ok and some days I wish I could die. I have been trying to be strong for my other son who needs his mother and honestly, but right now that's all I want to do. All of this newborn stuff in my house is like torture, and I can't wait to get it out of here. Now I'm rambling. Again, thank you all for your kind words.",,False,self,1356298684.0,t3_1573jv

Here’s a little something I thought I’d compose

Now that this pregnancy comes to a close

These past months haven’t been easy for me

So to you I give my version of pregnancy’s ABC’s

A-is for acne on face

B-is for bloating making you feel your very best 

C-constipation-backing you up all week

D-diarrhea that interrupts you when you sleep

E-is for exhaustion that messes with your head

F- is for forgetfulness that...did I leave my lights on?

G-is the way you clear rooms with your gas

H- are the hemorrhoids that are a pain in the ass

I-for indigestion the gift that keeps right on giving

J-for the junk food-making life still worth living

K-are the Kegles you do out of fear 

to stop

L-all that leakage when you sneeze or shed tears

M-morning sickness and the glow that it brings

N-is for nesting-I must clean all the things!

O-is for OB-your friend or your foe

P-is for period-at least that’s one thing that goes!

Q-all those questions that are rather invasive

R-is for ranting-the reasons pervasive

S-are for stretch marks that make you look like you’ve been attacked

T-for the TUMS that you keep tossing back

U-all that urination every minute or two

V-is for varicose veins in five shades of blue

W-is for weight that goes higher and higher

X-is for x-rated things that you no longer desire

Y-is for yeast infection because being itchy rocks!

Z-for the z’s your missing while watching the clock

Oh dear baby within me

For you I’d go through all these things a million times

I know you will be worth all this bother

But now please come out and meet me and your father!

On Friday, like everything I had read, to just take it easy and drink water and stay off my feet. If it didn't stop by Monday, call for an appointment. 
Well, at around 1:45 p.m., I used the bathroom and saw a quarter-sized clot when I wiped. I had the husband take me to the emergency room. I thought I had miscarried. 
We get there and they take my vitals and blood and my iron is dangerously low so they start an IV and get a second line ready in case they need to do a blood transfusion. By the time this was done, I was given anesthesia, and was in recovery by 7:00 p.m. that evening.
When I was in my room and the doctor visited, I might still need the transfusion, but due to the high amount of risks, they didn't want to give it to me unless absolutely necessary. They were also surprised that I didn't have any pain before the surgery. I didn't really, just a little that I thought was my uterus stretching.

I'm a female to male transsexual. You can learn lots more about me [here.](http://www.youtube.com/user/sillyyetsuccinct?feature=mhee) If you want to know about the medical process of transitioning

Just to head off the questions I routinely get

Q Where do you live?
A I was born in the U.S. then moved to Denmark and then to Sweden.

Q Why did you decide to get a sex-change?
A Nobody says ""sex-change"" anymore. It's super inaccurate. I came out of the closet as transgender because I've always been transgender and the secret was killing me. I decided to start medical transition because I spent years being suicidal and I thought it would help. It did. It saved my life. It felt like waking up after being a zombie for 10 years.

Q Have you had surgery?
A Yes. A double mastectomy.

Q Can you breastfeed?
A [This guy did.](http://www.milkjunkies.net/) But I probably can't/won't for many many reasons. I might share them in a breastfeeding thread if one comes up :)

Q Do you have a partner?
A Yes. He supplied the sperm

Q What is your partner's sexuality?
A Homosexual. Same as mine.

Q WHAT?
A Yes

Q If you like men why didn't you just stay a girl?
A *sigh* Because I'm transgender. I've always been transgender. Getting a boner for dudes didn't ""cure"" me from being transgender. You might as well ask a macho gay guy why he didn't just stay straight. Because that's not the way it works.

Q Won't your hormones fuck up the baby?
A No. I was on medically prescribed and monitored hormone replacement therapy for 2.5 years. I stopped a year ago in order to get pregnant. My endocrinologist and two OB/GYNs agreed that there is no reason why I shouldn't be able to have a perfectly healthy pregnancy.

Q God?
A We don't god.

Q Why did you decide to get pregnant?
A My partner and I don't qualify for adoption in Sweden where we live (loooooong story

Q Did you conceive naturally?
A Yes. Twice. I had a miscarriage in October. I had a miscarriage because sometimes miscarriages happen. It was not because I am transgender. It was awful. We were devastated. But we are absolutely thrilled to get pregnant again so quickly!

Q Pregnancy is the most womanly thing I've ever done. How can you do this and identify as a man?
A That's lovely for you. I'm happy that your pregnancy strengthened your gender identity. For me

Q Children?
A We want more than one but not sure how many yet.

Q How do friends/family/work colleagues react?
A They were a bit startled when we first told them our plans (and they had a billion questions)

Q Will you eventually get a penis?
A This is where things kind of cross the line for me. I want to join a pregnancy forum so that I can participate in pregnancy discussions. I'd really rather not engage in a lengthy

So what do you say? Can the weirdo queer kid join in all the reindeer games?
