Part of the goal was to encourage serious discussions of strategy regarding how to begin developing a mass movement on the left and overcome hurdles that too often reduce the idea of solidarity to something meaningless.

I would like to revive this more ambitious goal.  Surely there are people in this community who have good ideas that we could share as first steps.  I personally think the best start would be to just form multi-tendency discussion groups in our communities that focus more on immediate goals than differences of opinions on long term structural issues.  I also think those of us who support both electoral efforts and industrial unionism should start working to form [De Leonist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Leonism) tendencies in certain already existing parties to try to at least bridge the gap between democratic socialists and syndicalists as we simultaneously work to build an even more broad framework.

Also

I think the best initial actions such a hypothetical network would take would be setting short-, interrupting IMF meetings, organizing a workplace, restructuring a cities constitution to be participatory democratic, etc.), medium term goals being social or chunked (social: redefine socialism and anarchism in the social conscious, chunked: stop all nuclear production, end globalization attempts

(Capitalism may be defined as: the means of production are held in the hands of those other than the producers/workers)

That's my tired and rambling contribution. If you do this

Edit: I would simply like to add freedom of information (opposing capitalism's privatization of music, designs, stories, etc.) as a strong point of collective anti-capitalist opposition that is particularly relevant right now. De-privatizing information would be a middle-term goal with particular actions being the short term ones and of course the end of capitalism being the long term goal.

Thanks to the commenter who brought it up!

Following that you could also have freedom of land (de-privatizing land and radio frequencies) and freedom of workplaces (de-privatizing factories and machines) as general goals (and perhaps a 'freedom of cash' to de-privatize banks and credit unions). The problem here is that these are still negative goals. What do you replace them with? Some say control to the state,False,,t5_2shjt,True,,,t3_h9j25

I realize that many people on ""all the left"" don't believe in electoral politics, but this is a truly exceptional campaign.  And I am not saying this just because I am involved - I'm just lucky enough to be part of this campaign.  To give you an idea of its potential, it's already brought in a more diverse group of people to the Green Party of Philly than I've ever seen, Cheri and our candidate for City Commissioner were recently part of a coalition that stopped an anti-homeless bill in City Council, we've had substantial press coverage, we forced a local civic group to cover the campaign, we had over 150 people at a campaign headquarters opening, and the energy I've seen has been unbelievable.  And this is before things really heat up.

I'm not the only one who believes this

There are also house parties happening all over the country to support the campaign.  So far

So take a look at the website ( http://cherihonkala.com ), keep up to date with it, spread the word on the internet, contribute art or some other talent to the campaign, whatever!

And character is as evident in our adolescence as it is relevant in the White House.

That is why we the left, to the soft left liberals need to come together and create a revolution. What I am advocating is not violent overthrow, but a change in thought. We the left need to put aside our petty squabbles and create a revolutionary party to educate and promote real leftist values. We need to come together for the common and greater good, not for lesser evils. We have too long sold our souls to devils in angelic garb that we have lost ourselves but now is a time to find ourselves once more. 

We have become confused by the petty issues the forces in power feed to us instead of focusing on the issues that matter in order to bring about a more just

We should be focusing on:

Human Rights: 
-The rights of all humans to live independently without government or other groups dictating their lifestyle. 
-Free speech which means all speech is protected even speech you or I might disagree with because when you censor one it leads to censorship for all.
-The rights of workers to fight for better working conditions and fairer pay. 

Economic Equality:
-This does no mean redistributionism but that someone born in a poor area has just as much chance of surviving and thriving in the world as someone born in an affluent one. 
-A fair tax code.
-A reduction in unemployment
-Free
-We should strive to break up companies with too large a hold on sectors of the economy.
-If a ""too big to fail"" is failing it should be allowed to.
-Cooperatives should be more well known and easier to form and we should strive to have them replace top-down corporations as the preferred choice for businesses.
-There should be a cap on the amount that CEOs make adjusted to the profits a company makes as well as a minimum wage adjusted to the cost of living in our most expensive locale with both adjusted for inflation.

A Sustainable Future:
-Contrary to the Alarmists in the Environmentalist camp I won't say that what's going on is entirely humanity's fault because that's patently
-We should undertake to reduce our footprint on the environment and endeavor to guide other nations to do the same.
-We should look seriously at all forms of environmentally safe energy sources including Thorium nuclear reactors.
-We should endeavor to abandon all non-safe materials by the year 2065 except for purposes where environmental impact is minimal.
-We should strive to get chemicals out of our foods and drink that are unnecessary and detrimental to our overall health.

My thoughts aren't all thought out but that is why I'm here to gather like-minded souls who want to see true change

Bulgarian Anarchist Manifesto (1945)

PLATFORM OF THE FEDERATION OF ANARCHIST COMMUNIST OF BULGARIA

WE REJECT THE PRESENT SOCIAL SYSTEM OF State and capitalist centralization, on a political level by the state, and on a spiritual level by religion. These three forms of are linked. If you touch one, the others are changed and, inversely, you keep one form of power, it will inevitably lead to the re-establishment of the other two. This why we repudiate the very principle of power.

We are supporters of the abolition of private property, political and economic-political movement aimed at maintaining the State, private property, the church and constraint and violence in social relations.

We repudiate fascism

We reject political democracy, through lies and illusions, into fights which are against their interests, and corrupts them through the exercise of power and the maintaining of the appetite for Domination. Political democracy furthermore, shows that it is totally incapable of solving the great social problems and that it fosters chaos, contradictions and crime as a result of its social foundations based on the centralized State and capitalism.

We repudiate State socialism as it leads to State capitalism--the most monstrous form of economic exploitation and oppression

We are for anarchist communism or free communism, and of all goods and services of production. The State will be replaced by the federation of free communes regionally, provincially, nationally and internationally united. The church and religion will be replaced by a free individual moral and scientific vision.

Unlike all other socio-economic and political concepts and organizations

The new social organization that will replace the State will be built and run from the bottom upwards. All the inhabitants of any given village will form the local free commune, nationally and internationally in unions and federations and in a universal general social confederation.

The new organization of society's production will be formed by a close network of countless local agricultural enterprises, industry, transport, etc,. united on a regional, provincial, national and international level in production unions and federations as part of a general confederation of productions.

Society's new organization of exchange, unions and federations, grouped in a general confederation of exchange and consumption for satisfying the needs of all inhabitants.

All human social activity and all transport, healthcare, and so on, will be organized in similar fashion.

With this organizational system of all the functions of the carious aspects of social life

The basic principle of production and distribution for the building of the new social system will be: everyone will produce according to their possibilities and everyone will receive according to their needs.

The realization of this social ideal of equality, professional, exchange, consumption, cultural and education groups.

Anarchist communism, in parliament and in any vote for the official management of the state.

As the sole means of efficient struggle, anarchism recognizes on the direct action of the workers themselves, initiated by their economic organizations and expressed through strikes, sabotages, boycotts, general strikes, insurrections and the social revolution. In consequences, considering the

Organizational decisions within anarchist communist organizations are made unanimously, which reserves the right to express the correctness of its positions, once it has been demonstrated in fact. Thanks to this principle, which is widely applied within the anarchist movement, splits, enmities, and arguments are rare.

However, as only in this way can unity be achieved, unity that is absolutely indispensable in the mass organizations. But in certain cases where there is profound disagreement, the minority may be freed from the obligation to apply a general decision, on condition that it does not present the execution of such a decision...

We came up with several ideas

 

**Also:**

 

- Post tear tab fliers with party contact info on public bulletin boards at universities, libraries, etc.

 

- Provide moral support any future strikes that may happen in the state by taking food and drinks out to the picket line for the striking workers.

 

- Look into the logistics of starting up or getting involved in a blanket drive around Thanksgiving and going through winter/the holiday season. The idea was to buy a lot of sturdy light blankets (think like the ones the Army uses) and screen print them with the party logo before distributing them. We figured that while we were working with screen printing with that it would probably be good to go ahead and try to screen print some t shirts too for when we are out and about and especially when we are doing volunteer work.

 

- Other less seasonal work we could do with the homeless. Like go out on as regular of basis as possible and give free water in the summer and coffee in the fall and winter. It was suggested that we could home print paper slips for these with little blurbs about party goals

 

- Look at venues and musicians we know about in Huntsville and Tuscaloosa to try to organize shows where people donate canned food as part of their cover charge. It would show us out helping to create events people enjoy while simultaneously doing good in the community.

 

- Look at venues for hosting Free Stores.  Allow people to come together to meet their needs in a way that does not squeeze resources from them.

 

- Start donating books to prison library systems with information on an inside cover encouraging people to contact us about assistance in filling out the forms needed for felons to have their voting rights returned.

 

**Longer term goals:**

 

- Form a consumer cooperative to reduce financial hardship of members by allowing for large bulk buying.

 

- Eventually form a cooperatively managed business to provide a very tangible example of our ideals.

 

**Party structure discussion:**

 

- Comrade R.F. is going to look into what exactly would be the best route for us in terms of getting a charter.

 

- Discussed the formation of locals. It was proposed that Arab

 

- Consensus was reached that it would be better to wait about selecting a state executive after we have drawn in more interest, and secretary or chair, co-chair, and secretary.

 

- Future scheduling for meetings will be done much more ahead of time to give more people an opportunity to plan for attendance.  This first meeting was planned on short notice mainly to just go ahead and get things rolling and provide a loose framework.",,t5_2shjt,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/alltheleft/comments/jy3ag/first_meeting_of_the_socialist_party_of_alabama/

* [_Thoughts On The World Economic Crisis_](http://www.marxistoutlook.com/article19.htm) by Albert Einstein.

&gt;""I share your concern about maintaining our civil liberties

My response (I hand wrote it for funsies):

Dear Jean

Thank you for your response. I appreciate that you took the time to write back to me. I am

You emphasized that “a balance” must be struck “between the needs of our government and the protections guaranteed to us in the Constitution.” I think this fundamentally misunderstands the nature of rights. The rights we are given in the Constitution are not negotiable. Our rights are not something to be limited, nor subject to “balancing.”

History looks unfavorably upon those who have limited our rights for a temporary “need of government.” Need I remind you of the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798

Perhaps though I am mistaken in my understanding of our rights. As a student of history, and that rights must be enduring. Rights cannot be compromised for the short-term benefit of the government; they must be truly “guaranteed” to the people. If I am mistaken here, will you kindly correct me?

After re-reading your letter I am afraid that I cannot in good conscience support you any longer. You have violated your oath of office – you have failed to protect the United States Constitution and my rights as a citizen. You have failed to use your national voice to stand up for me and 307 million of my fellow countrymen. For that

My questions on how do we support each other when some of our views are so incompatible:

* Will a socialist vote or work in solidarity with a liberal/social democrat to relieve immediate suffering even if it does not directly address real socialist goals?  Example: The recent American health care reform.
* Will a revolutionary socialist vote or work in solidarity with a democratic socialist in order to forward a minor socialist reform?  Example: Some sort of subsidy in order to encourage workplace democracy/cooperatives.
* Will an anarchist vote or work in solidarity with another leftist to assist people/communal interests even if that means establishing an institution/hierarchy used to defend those people/interests?  Example: Unions, EPA.

movement with leftist goals but dropping most 
leftist methods?",2,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/alltheleft/comments/vfuqq/spanish_lost_soul_here_is_there_any_modern/,"I'm Spanish and we are currently pretty screwed up by banks and the politizians we voted. There's a lot of rage and hate in the population right now but nobody is able to channel it at all. I think most people would like to jail current politicians and let banks go bankrupt, but there's no union on the left at all to achieve it.

These are the main problems I see for which people in our country don't turn to the left at all

**Leftist political parties**

* One of our main political party is leftist
* Economically they do basically the same as the right
* They are as corrupt as the right
* In social rights they are better
* The minor leftist parties all that seem to want is to spend money on social causes
* They are also pretty corrupt wherever they get some power

**Unions**

* They shut up as long as the left corrupt party is in power
* They don't fight much for the general population jobs
* They defend some highly paid public employees. What's the point of defending decent jobs if the rest of the society has to pay for them and has shitty jobs?
* They are pretty corrupt too

**More extreme ideologies**

* They seem to have very ""enemy oriented"" methods but what will they do once there's no enemy? People aren't going to change their natures just because you destroy the current power
* People don't think anymore that there's any intrinsic difference between rich people and poor people except for their economical situation. People aren't going to rely in any liberator.
* They never show any long-term successful different societies. There's very little efford in creating them except for some squatters and that doesn't appeal to people in general.

So is there any kind of modern movement that can channel all this society outrage?",,t5_2shjt,1340387633.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/alltheleft/comments/vfuqq/spanish_lost_soul_here_is_there_any_modern/

There are a couple stages to this

There are a couple stages necessary from where it seems we are right now.

**1)** Establish the proper and correct terminology to discuss and explain and educate others on this issue. I am not a lawyer. If you are or know one will would be willing to provide legal advice to assist with making sure we use only correct and verifiable information in executing the following steps

**2)** We will also need people talented with digital arts to help create flyers and advertising and resources for a website. It should at this point be an issue of layout and not content if we will first seek to refine the message.

**3)** Boots on the ground. Once we have the properly advised information we will need to disseminate it. I think flyers are optimal for this since we are ideally trying to target people outside reddit's demographic (high internet consuming adult males under 35 or whatever). Perhaps organization of protests with placards. But this phase is really grass roots and can be as creative it wants. Just as long as we make sure to stick to only the properly confirmed information


Am I crazy or is this something others actually want to help with?
