What we **really** need is **content**: tips and tricks you have learned through trial and error, videos and documentaries that share the passion of breadmaking... you get the point.

**My intention isn't to be preachy, though, that I've seen ages-old forums with really bad formats that teach me better tips (like ice-steaming), but it takes digging through pages of comments.

I've seen some demand for more content oriented posts that could possibly bring some discussion to the table

I have a crappy food blog that I post to occasionally as a hobby

**The Twelve Steps of Baking**

*Scaling* – This is the measuring of all ingredients before mixing. All ingredients should be weighed when possible. This is the most accurate form of measuring in a kitchen. A cup of flour does not equal the same weight as a cup of sugar. A cup of flour on Tuesday may not even weigh the same as a cup of flour on Friday. If you plan on baking a lot at home

*Mixing* – Mixing is everything! This is where you control 80% of how your final product will turn out! Mixing can be done by hand or with a machine

* Add water
* Add yeast
* Add flour
* Add Salt
* Add remaining ingredients
* Start mixing (on speed one if using a machine)

This seems simple enough, then we can start the second step, which is called development. This is where we develop gluten.

*Bulk Fermentation* – Now we do the first and primary fermentation. Fermentation is a biological process from the yeast. Yeast eats sugar and break it down into alcohol, and the acids add flavor. The longer and slower the fermentation process, the better the flavor.

*Punch and Fold* – This step is kind of a part of the bulk fermentation step. Once the dough has doubled in size, and then we fold the dough a few times, which helps to further develop the dough and redistributes the heat that is caused by fermentation. After punching and folding, we continue the bulk fermentation once more. 

*Divide* – After the bulk fermentation and punching has been done, we're only making one loaf of bread, so dividing won't be necessary.

*Pre-shape* – Once the dough has been divided into pieces, the pre-shape will actually be more of an oblong or football shape, as would be the case for making a long baguette. Pre-shaping helps with development and makes it easier to do a final shape.

*Bench Rest* – Handling the dough will toughen it up a little and cause it to be too elastic and difficult to work with, up to an hour depending on the dough type.

*Final Shape* – Now the dough is shaped into its final shape. Common shapes are boules (rounded) or batardes (football) but there are hundreds of different shapes out there. The final shaping influences what the bread will look like when it is finished

*Final Proof* – The final shape(s) need to sit in a warm spot, the dough will double in size. Proofing will take some practice, though. Not proofing enough will cause the dough to burst when it's being baked. Proofing it too much might cause the dough to not rise enough, as the gluten will have stretched too much. In some cases, the bread could fall completely. 

*Bake* – Bread baking is one of the shortest steps of the process, your oven is not a commercial one, so don't expect commercial results. Commercial ovens are designed to keep within a certain temperature range at all times. Not so much with your oven at home. If you set your oven at 400 degrees F, expect temperatures ranging from 375 - 425 degrees F. Bread ovens are also equipped with steam capabilities. Steam helps to create better oven spring and will interact with the starches on the surface of the bread to create a sheen and enhance browning. There are things that can help adapt your oven, however. Invest in a baking stone. Sheet pans work ok, but baking stones are much better, as they help transfer heat evenly to the bread more efficiently when preheated properly. A pizza peel will also come in very handy for getting the bread in and out of the oven. I also recommend a spray bottle full of water. You can spray the sides of the oven a few times during the first five minutes of baking to simulate steam injection. Another way of to simulate steam injection is to keep a pan of water on the bottom rack of the oven. The dough will need to be ""slashed"" to relieve the surface tension of the dough and prevent it from bursting when it completes its final rise in the oven.
 
*Cool* – Now we cool the bread. Although tempting

*Store/Eat* – So

It can be (and has been) argued that some of these steps are so close together that they can be combined into one step. Some have learned this process as the ten steps of baking. But

**Edit:** Some were unclear on the Mixing step and thought that I forgot kneading. Kneading is the same as development and is required to develop gluten. It is done on a higher speed than incorporation,False,self,t5_2s8h0,1364033306.0,,,t3_1arytl

1364561348.0,1b8lvr,What you should know about wheat and flour,Inquebiss,49,4,8,"I used to teach a bread baker's crash course

**Wheat Flour**
	
*The Wheat Kernel* – courtesy of the Montana Wheat and Barley Committee

* Bran - About 14% of the kernel weight. The bran is included in whole wheat flour and is also available separately. The bran contains a small amount of protein
* Endosperm - About 83% of the kernel weight and the source of white flour. The endosperm contains the greatest share of protein, niacin, thiamin and iron. It is also a source of soluble fiber.
* Germ - About 2.5% of the kernel weight. The germ is the embryo or sprouting section of the seed

*Wheat Classes*

* Hard Red Winter Wheat -  The dominant class in U.S. exports and the largest class produced each year. Produced in the Great Plains states, rolls and, to a lesser extent, sweet goods and all-purpose flour. Major foreign buyers include Russia, China, Japan, Morocco and Poland.
* Hard Red Spring Wheat -  Contains the highest percentage of protein, South Dakota and Minnesota. Exported largely to Central America, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines and Russia.
* Soft Red Winter Wheat -  Grown primarily east of the Mississippi River. High yielding, pastries, and crackers. Largest customers are China, Egypt and Morocco.
* Hard White Wheat -  The newest class of wheat to be grown in the United States. Closely related to red wheats (except for color genes), equal fiber and similar milling and baking properties. Used mainly in yeast breads, hard rolls, bulgur, tortillas and oriental noodles. Used primarily in domestic markets, although it is exported in limited quantities.
* Soft White Wheat -  Used in much the same way as Soft Red Winter (for bakery products other than bread). Grown mainly in the Pacific Northwest and to a lesser extent in California, but high yielding. Produces flour for baking cakes, crackers, cookies, pastries, quick breads, muffins and snack foods. Exported to Far East Asian region.
* Durum -  The hardest of all U.S. wheat and consistently the class with the lowest export volume

*Milling Process* – courtesy of How Baking Works

Milling wheat has two purposes. One is to separate the endosperm from the bran and germ. The second is to grind the endosperm as finely as possible without damaging the starch granule. Once the endosperm is finely ground

* Straight Flour – Combines all usable parts of the endosperm including trace amounts of bran and germ. This flour is not often used in the American baking industry
* Clear Flour – The lowest grade of flour from the endosperm. Very high in protein content and ash content
* Patent Flour – Most common of flours on the market. Uses the inner most part of the endosperm resulting in the highest quality. Contains very little bran and ash content. The following flours are considered patent flours:

1. Bread Flour – Made from hard red spring or winter wheats. Contains 11-13% protein content
2. Hi-gluten Flour – Generally comes from hard red winter wheats. Contains 13-15% protein
3. Artisan Bread Flour – Relatively new on the market, and is often blended to resemble French wheat flours, which are typically not as strong as American flour. Less protein results in crisper crusts, and large, irregular holes. Although it contains less protein, the protein is of higher quality (produces more gluten).
4. All-Purpose Flour – AP flour varies from brand to brand. Often made with a blend of hard and soft wheats
5. Pastry Flour – Made from soft red winter wheat. Has a low protein content between 7-9%, muffins, scones, etc.
6. Cake Flour – Treated with chlorine and hydrogen peroxide to change the physical make up of the flour. This is essential to break down starches so they are able to absorb more moisture

*Aging Process* - courtesy of How Baking Works

After Flour is milled

* Natural Aging – The flour sits around for a few weeks to a month. Pretty easy. However, and can be susceptible to pests. 
* Chemical Aging - “Maturing agents” are used to speed up the aging process. Some maturing agents strengthen, and hydrogen peroxide.

WHEAT BELONGS TO the family of grasses
and comes in a variety of different species:
types of wheat can be differentitated by sowing
time (spring or winter),
amber)

The most important characteristics of wheat
for a baker is hardness: harder wheats contain
more protein than their softer siblings. Two of
the proteins—glutelin and gliadin—wich
account for 80 % of the protein in wheat flour
form gluten when they get in contact with
water.

Bakers often speak of gluten strength when
talking about the baking properties of different
flours (with equal protein quantities): flours with
stronger gluten lead to a dough that can be
kneaded longer and create better elasticity
leading to a bread that retains its shape better
when it's resting than a weaker flour.

WHEN BUYING FLOUR from the grocery store
depending on where you live
range of different flours
wheats for different intended usages.
Bread flour is white flour made of hard
high-protein wheat. The protein percentage
can be as high as 14 but usually stays
somewhere around 12 or 13. This is a good
choice for yeasted breads
use a bakery mixer
slowly leavened sourdough loaves worked by
hand.

A softer alternative is all-purpose flour
which is a mixture of hard and soft wheat
varieties
on the other hand can be too weak for a good
loaf of bread. In her book
Emily Buehler recommends a level of about
11.5 %—the protein level of the French ""type
55"" bread flour—to get the best gluten
structure for white bread.

Experiment with the different flours until you
find one that works for you and the recipes you
use. Also
of water you use. Flours with more gluten
forming proteins benefit from more water. As
you experiment
favorite flour in the end might not be what you'd
expect at first. For example
fan of organic food
in Finland is not organic or fancy in any way—it
just leads to the most consistent results
sticking to it until I find an organic flour that
does the same for me.

FRESHLY MILLED WHEAT FLOUR is light
yellow and the gluten in it is still quite weak.
When the flour is allowed to rest and age for six
weeks or more and the flour reacts with oxigen
it turns white and the gluten forming proteins
gain more strength.

This process takes quite a bit of time
many flour manufacturers are eager to hurry it
up. To get the same results quicker
bleachening agent such as peroxide (benzoyl
peroxide) or chlorine oxide. This leads to a
flour that has the same baking qualities as a
naturally whitened flour but faster.

As this process can also leave unwantedside effects to the flour
possible. And naturally
to go for a flour with as little additives as
possible.

A GRAIN OF WHEAT is composed of three
layers: the bran
When making white flour
endosperm is discarded. As this process
wastes such a big part of the grain
be a special treat only available to the richest
people of the time
the healthier choice everyone should strive for
if possible.

Nowadays
everyone
flour is gaining in recognition as the healthier—
and more flavorful choice: in theory (although
as we will soon see
clear cut),
A, as well as
the bran that helps your body in digesting the
bread.

These good properties come at a cost:
making a beautiful
flour is much harder than doing it with
white flour. Luckily
dough will always be denser than its white
counterpart
tricks
bread that doesn't look and taste like a brick.

JUST LIKE MOST WHITE FLOUR
wholegrain flour sold in stores is roller milled. In
roller milling
from the grain before the rest of the grain is
ground. After the grinding
extraction level of the flour being made
or all of the bran is added back in the flour. The
germ
rancid quickly
part of what makes wholegrain flour healthy!
STONE MILLING WORKS works the opposite
way: the whole grain is ground between a pair
of stones
sifted out as desired—but with the germ
included. This is why stone ground flour is
probably healthier and more flavorful than roller
milled flour.

Because stone ground flour contains the
germ
within a couple of weeks from milling
in a cool place such as your refrigerator.
The oxidation period is long enough to lose
most of the minerals and vitamins from the
flour. For example all of vitamin E disappears
from fresh flour in just one day from grinding.
For white flour—which doesn't have much of
the goods left in it anyway—this doesn't matter
much (and in most cases
to go)
from wholegrain
nearby mill or milling your own flour are the
only options.

I bake big 2.5lbs loaves every week (or every two days when family visit) and I noticed that while the crust is nice and crunchy after baking it goes soft in the morning. Yesterday I realised it is caused by the steam that is generated inside the bread during the cooling process. My solution - I let the bread cool upside down - the crust was perfect this morning - all the steam escaped through the bottom. 
Also I learned that when it comes to baking stones thicker doesn't mean better - it's taking ages to warm up and doesn't allow the bottom of the bread to carmelise properly as if shielding it from the heat.

Ingredients:

* 2 Tbsp. sugar
* 1 Tbsp. baking powder
* 1 tsp. salt
* 2 Tbsp. honey or agave nectar
* 1 bottle (12 ounces) beer
* 4 Tbsp. (half stick) butter

**Method:**

(Makes 1 loaf)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9x 5x 3-inch loaf pan.

In a medium bowl, baking powder and salt. Using a wooden spoon, stir the beer and honey into the dry ingredients until just mixed. (I recommend popping your honey in the microwave for a few seconds beforehand to make it easier to stir in)

Pour half the melted butter into the loaf pan. Then spoon the batter into the pan

Bake for 50 to 60 minutes

1348259382.0,109lbt,My First Loaf - Oh Man!,manmademound,24,3,9,"Thanks to discovering Breadit I wanted to try my hand at an artisan-style loaf. I used the no-knead recipe from the 2006 NY Times article: http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/08/dining/081mrex.html 

I am so surprised how well it turned out for being so simple. I made the dough yesterday and let it rise for about 20 hours

My question is what could I do to get the inside a little less chewy and moist? I guess it's quite glutinous? I don't have a good mixer so anything I do has to either be no-knead or hand kneaded (which sounds messy and difficult

I can't wait to start trying variations on this and then hopefully onto something more challenging.

That question brought a lot of good suggestions

However...this bread is crumbly.  The cohesiveness of individual slices is not good.  It is certainly nothing like what you get out of store-bought.  It isn't close to what I can get in my typical breads either.  I tried kneading it for longer (I use the Kitchen-Aid attachment)
