Are YOU bored of going on FUT and just playing season after season

WELL LISTEN UP

My idea is that we get as many FUT players as we can to join in on this sub in a multiple of 4.  We set a deadline, as many as possible.

Since I have no idea who's good and who's not, I don't want to set too strict of a deadline on that because some people may not always be available when you are!  I suppose when you match up with someone, play them once in your stadium, and then right after, play them at theirs, so you get two games out of the way right then and there.

After the group stages are over, and C at random unless someone has a better idea.

We'll play out the double elimination tournament and I can make as many posts as necessary to update people on standings and the tournament tree.  Just comment below that you're in and I'll begin making the groups.  After that I'll post again telling everyone who they're playing and you can contact each other via PM and share gamertags (so this way only the people you play know your gamertag)

I'll make an Excel Spreadsheet and get this all very organized

Comment if you have ANY ideas on how this could the best possible online tournament ever, but hell, I'll organize a PS3 tournament and post results/keep everyone informed if you want me too as well!

So comment below if you think you're man enough to try and conquer us all.  Or woman enough.  Do girls play FIFA?  That's a mystery to me... and lol at whoever's downvoting my comments

And UPVOTE THIS so it goes to the top

My friends in FIFA!  Welcome to the 2nd of what looks like will be many posts from me regarding the greatest of FIFA tournaments of all time.  As of the moment I type this

A few things I need to take care of:

FIRST:

[These are the rules.  Give this a good read.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xJEapzOleNOvyFrAN1yNL3fVYGwbuy-OJ5KXKxVDuXc/edit?usp=sharing)  If you have any gripes, so we can get going with it, the general rules will hold true unless a large majority dislike something about the tournament.  But I think it sounds fair, fun, relaxed, and EPIC.  Hope you all agree.

SECOND:

I need you all to comment on this post IF YOU ARE ALREADY SIGNED UP FOR THE TOURNAMENT, and only one of 5:

West Coast USA

Central USA

East Coast USA

Europe

~~South America~~ LOL Australia/NZ/Oceania/Asia

Only say differently if you feel you live *significantly* elsewhere from one of those 5 options.  This is for group assignment purposes.  So people close to each other can play at good times and have good connections.  Again, go to the original post telling me you want in, what console, and where you live.

THIRD:

If you have any more specific comments or anything really

Thanks for the support and the help so far

-dlucisan

**First Edit:  Keep it coming guys, but we we will need to get going.  As of this update, we have 48 PS3 players and ONE HUNDRED TWENTY XBOX PLAYERS HOLY FUCKING SHIT.  KEEP SIGNING UP IF YOU HAVEN'T YET, AND GET YOUR FRIENDS TO AS WELL!  THERE IS NO CAP, AND REGISTRATION IS OPEN ALLLL THE WAY UNTIL THURSDAY AT NOON EAST COAST USA TIME!  I'M SO EXCITED!!!**

The bacteria

**How did it start?**

The source of the infection is unknown

**What are the symptoms?**

The first and most obvious sign of infection is a tendency to use fast players in every position

- profuse sweating
- a tendency to hold down the run button
- use of so called 'lonely' skill - the player will use skill moves in open space when there is no need to
- loss of the ability to play a square pass
- a propensity for using lofted through ball over and over again
- an inability to use the ball in the middle of the pitch
- tendency to use extremely bright coloured kits and balls.
- playing on narrow and ultra-defensive in order to have at least seven defensive players in and around the penalty box.
- monosyllabic, and 'bro'.
- at every kick off
- in severe cases
- when winning
- an early warning sign is the excessive use of the word 'beast' when speaking about their players or team.
- using team names referencing Jimmy Savile





**What should I do if I encounter someone who has been infected?**

The best advice is to avoid an infected person altogether

**Is there a cure?**

there is no known cure for paceitis-352. However


**What can I do to help?**

Paceitis-352 is a serious affliction and players who are affected should be treated with sympathy and support, or even try putting through balls on manual. With patience and time they might get better, although even those who believe they are cured will often revert to their old style once they start losing a game.

**What's does the future hold?**

Scientists generally believe that if left unchecked the infection could result in the death of FIFA. be vigilant!

I first saw this information posted in FUTHEAD at the end of FIFA 12. However, but it may be useful for new players.

So as you know, but all roads start with a basic question, which is:

How many chemistry points does a player need to reach 9 chemistry?

Some players need more chemistry points than others

[4-2-2-2 link arrangement](http://i.imgur.com/fDrJk.png)

In the 4-2-2-2
The strikers only need 2 chemistry points each because they only have 2 links.
The CDMs need 4 chemistry points because they have 4 links.
The Fullbacks need only 2 points

All of this provided the players are in the correct formation and position. If they're not in the correct formation AND position

So

* A league link awards 1 chemistry point. 
* A nationality link awards 1.5 chemistry points.
* A club link awards 1.5 chemistry points.

However, club mates get 2.5 chemistry points always (1 point for the league + 1.5 points for the club).

Players from the same league and same nationality also get 2.5 points (1 point for the league + 1.5 for nationality).

Finally
Here you can see a very basic hybrid with 3 leagues and various nationalities. 

[Basic Hybrid](http://i.imgur.com/uoSCD.png)

[All of them in 9 chemistry](http://i.imgur.com/isfa0.png)

Eto'o gets 2.5 points from Bousouffa because they're from the same club

Bousouffa gets 2.5 points from Eto'o

Same with Cisse and Taraabt

Tiote gets 5 points even with 2 dead links

You get the idea. 

**Formations and Position are very important as well.**

When players are one position away from the slot they are placed in (shown as an orange boot), but if you put a CF in the ST slot then he'll need 4 chemistry points instead of 2 points to reach 9 chemistry.

If players are two or more positions away from where they are placed (shown as a red boot)

[Take Wijnaldum as an example](http://i.imgur.com/AESL8.png)

[Only 5 chemistry for Wijnaldum](http://i.imgur.com/AyZHH.png)

As shown above, yet because he is 2 positions away he can only reach 5 chemistry.  If Wijnaldum were a CF, he would get the full 9 chemistry.

Formations are a bit more forgiving. If a player is one formation away (shown as an orange formation) then the player will need double the chemistry points required by his position to reach 9 chemistry.

If a player is in a completely incompatible formation (shown as a red formation), and 2.5 from Roy Beerens, yet he can only reach 8 individual chemistry because he is in the wrong formation.

[Locadia](http://i.imgur.com/S7EKY.png)

[Locadia can only reach 8 chemistry](http://i.imgur.com/EO81H.png)

Lastly, he only reaches 8 individual chemistry even while receiving 10 chemistry points.

[Wijnaldum only gets 8 chem](http://i.imgur.com/8t4sg.png)

1) Transfer History screen - Sortable by year/club/league; its just incredibly baffling to me that they haven't added this already. You can only review transfers for the window that is currently happening

2) Kit tweaks - Why not give us the option to change the colors (not the design itself

3) Training focus - FIFA doesn't need a complex training system like FM, defending, aerobic)

4) Reserve/youth academy game stats

5) More sortable stats in general for your first team

6) Primary/secondary lineups - We've all been there, and you know you're playing an inferior team. Why not give us the option before the season of setting a ""secondary"" lineup, which automatically subs in your backups? 

7) Depth chart/auto subs - As an add-on to #6, and let's say Daniel Agger's ""Auto Rest"" setting is anything less than 95% stamina. The game would then go to the next CB on my ""depth chart"" and sub the player in automatically (talking before the game, but this could be expanded to in-game subs as well) if Agger's stamina was 95% or less.

8) Less dumb interruptions during simulating - If I send my scout out to Brazil for 6 months, I'm here. Send me somewhere."" Wouldn't it be easier just to give them instructions immediately after being hired? Why not just give me the option to turn those e-mails on/off?

1350851552.0,11uxy3,Career Tips,NachoTheGreat,67,9,20,"I recently posted a comment about tips for career mode which a decent number of people seemed to find helpful

First

Transfer Tips:

1. When you start out, a 36-yr-old defender rated at 81, my first season, and by the end he was a 76 despite being in decent form (everyone else was in good form).

2. Instead of getting a 35-yr-old player with an 80 rating

3. Get players with good stats in key areas, and tackling (standing more so than sliding, depending on your game style). Having high stats in areas like crossing will artificially inflate their overall grade. If you like crossing, then go for that.

4. Unless you desperately need cash

5. **Free Agency**- I have seen a few people complain that no one is in free agency. Every year, and young players have really low wages. Buy them up and sell them later.

Scouting Tips:

1. This is not the way to make big money in FIFA unless you are a small club. You can make a couple million here or there

2. Hire scouts that are from power-house countries. I have more luck scouting in Brazil and the US than in small countries. Having a scout work in their home country gives them a boost

3. When you first hire scouts

4. Don't be afraid to sign players and fill up your youth squad. I usually keep my squad full and cut players as they turn out to suck. If a player isn't rated at least 60 when they are 16 or have potential in the low 80s, you will use them, or you can sell them.

Loaning Players:

1. Make sure all of your players have the correct transfer/loan listing at the beginning of the transfer window. Getting players sold or out on loan doesn't always work

2. Sending players to better clubs will boost their stats the most. I sent a 68 defender to Man U and he came back a 72

3. Players in good form will be more apt to be loaned or transferred.

General Tips/ Observations:

1. Your players will be more likely to get injured if you simulate games.

2. Initially you can tailor your formation to your squad

3. Asking for more money from your Board can help

4. Don't get ""Pokemon Syndrome"" and press A as fast as possible when you are between games and news bulletins keep popping up. Players will often ask you to play them or sit them after the news flashes

I dont play the CPU

But there is something about Fifa13 that really grinds my gears and it is not the game itself, Atletico Madrid and other non-5 star teams. Mainly because I find it tedious to play every match against Ronaldo and Messi. And that is ok, I still enjoy the game and people can play 5 star if they want to. But this time around all matches I play follows a simple template. My opponent has one strong, fast striker and then a parked bus. I hate it. It is boring, predictable and I admittedly cant beat that. I have tried parking the bus, but that doesnt work for me - I play balanced/attacking and I try to create the game through posseision but it is not working for me in Fifa13.

I realized that I dont enjoy the game anymore

Happy gaming.  ",self,t5_2smu8,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fifa13/comments/12imyh/i_dont_hate_the_game_i_hate_the_players/

So here it goes

When taking a shot **IN SPACE WITH THE BALL ROLLING AWAY FROM THE PLAYERS BODY**, with immense power. It is highly useful for longshots when executed perfectly. **It works best when holding LT when taking a shot with decent power**, that's just a normal power shot, but holding back adds something extra to it. 

So here's an example as to how I'd do it if I was shooting to the right goal using Xbox controls: LT+B+direction you want to shoot (I'm going to use a clock for direction, once in the shooting animation, switch the stick to the direction of 8 whilst still holding LT the whole time. 

Try it out in the arena for a few minutes to get the hang of it with some longshots. I have known about this since FIFA10

It also adds some power to finesse shots

Sorry if this is a bad explanation

Try it out and please tell me how you get on.

1358064173.0,16hffc,Full review of the World XI,zipko,41,8,17,"I wrote this up for a fan site for FIFA 13

**Casillas:** Of the 11, ones who let just about everything through, but among the good ones there's very little difference. I don't consider TOTY Casillas to be any better or worse than Hart, Buffon, Lloris and so on. He's a status symbol in your squad and nothing more.

**Dani Alves:** The last time I used Dani Alves was back in FUT 11, good passing and pace that will give defenders fits all match. In a defensive role, he's excellent at tracking back on the ball. Give a striker a 10 yard head start from the halfway line and Alves will still run him down and make the tackle. He's my saving grace to cover for me when I get hit on an unexpected counter and need to catch an attacker who's already behind my backline.

**Sergio Ramos:** Ramos is probably the least noticeable of the players in the World XI. But for a CB, and despite his high attack work rate I never see him out of position. Of the two CB's in TOTY he's the better defender. At 6'0"", he's also a solid target man in the box for corners. He's got his share of headed goals for me and provides that rare combination of pace and strength that's hard to find in a defender.

**Pique:** Don't be fooled by the card, for all the defensive accolades I can give, Pique does have the tendency to roam. He spends about 50% of his time pressed forward into a midfield role. This can be good in some ways, as he gives your midfield an easy outlet for a safe pass back. In keeping possession he'll provide an extra midfield option and puts you almost into a 3 defender formation at times when he's forward and your fullbacks are back. If you play with 5 defenders, Pique is the ideal option for your center CB.

**Marcelo:** Dani Alves with less pace and better dribbling seems to be the best I can describe Marcelo. He's instrumental in providing width to my attack. I play my TOTY in a 4312 and rely heavily on the fullbacks to cover the wings, is a dream with Marcelo. His tackling is the weakest of the 4 TOTY defenders, but he has plenty of pace to be able to track back in coverage and at least get in the way. His shooting in the box is excellent, however he does have the downside in this regard of being left footed. You won't be able to cut in on the right as is popular with wingers. For crossing, his attempts are serviceable although admittedly I don't do very much crossing so I can't provide too much insight as to which TOTY players would be best for serving balls into the box. One final comment before leaving the defenders, these four all have high attack work rates. When building a team, make sure that any TOTY defenders that you're using are properly paired with other defensive players that have more of a defensive work rate. If you play an entire backline of high attack rate players then your defense will be dangerously too far downfield. When I use the TOTY my defense will often be 10 yards past the midfield line. 90% of the goals I concede are on counters directly related to my defense being pushed too far forward.

**Xabi Alonso:** Alonso is the weakest of the 3 midfielders, but if you need an anchor to your midfield this is your best option. When comparing the 3 midfielders, they can all pass, they can all defend well, and they all have amazing long shots. They'll bury anything within 30 yards if you give them an open lane. The big difference between Alonso and the other two is that Alonso doesn't have the dribbling ability of Xavi and Iniesta. With only 2 star skill moves, if you want to attack with Alonso you're going to have to pass to do it. He's still very dangerous in the attack, and a opposing defense better be sure to always have a man in front of Alonso anytime he has the ball. If you're dribbling forward with no defender marking you then just rip a shot and laugh at the lazy defense giving up such an easy goal. For those who have seen my other player reviews, so there's always that.

**Xavi:** The middle of the 3 midfielders in terms of rank, it won't be an issue if you're playing a ball control game with a steady buildup. Xavi can walk through a defense single-handedly with his tight dribbling and spot on passing. His one time passing brings back the ping-pong days that everyone complained about before first touch was introduced. No complaints though when it's your own team that can pick apart a defense with pass and move tactics. Xavi is also well rounded on the defensive front, and will never be a liability playing in the center of your midfield. Like Alonso, if you find yourself walking towards goal with no defender in front of you, don't hesitate to shoot. This midfield all share very high long shot ratings and can bang them in with ease.

**Iniesta:** Iniesta is absolutely the perfect CAM. He has it all, shooting with just enough pace that you can even be sweaty with him. His ball control is even better than Xavi's, and if you walk downfield holding LT you'll be amazed at how helpless he makes anyone who gets in his way look. It really takes a double team to take the ball off Iniesta. A single defender can't stop him. When I want to run a One Man Army and just try to beat an entire defense without passing Iniesta is my first choice to do it. You can give him the ball at the midfield line and just let him step through the midfield. Like the other CMs, if a defender doesn't step up once you get into space behind the midfield then just let rip. I'm not sure exactly of the workrates of the midfielders, but I have noticed that Iniesta tends to push forward more than the other two. This will help him in a role as a CAM or CF and is something to keep in mind when choosing the players around him in your squad. The one downside to Iniesta is that he's the most expensive of the TOTY midfielders. This high price tag is largely due to his position change to CM instead of LM, as well as a lower drop rate than Xavi and Alonso. If coins aren't an issue then Iniesta is the must have of these midfielders.

**Falcao:** Falcao is somewhat the Ramos of the attack in this team. What I mean by that is that Falcao will do his job flawlessly all game, you can cut back to the left and be just as effective, often catching the defense by surprise and getting a wide open lane. While people often tend to think of Falcao as a target man for crosses, be sure to take advantage of his dribbling. He has 4 star skill moves and his control is very responsive.

**Messi:** EA's poster child, Messi has the ability to destroy a defense even without support. While some criticize his lack of strength, it won't be an issue if you aren't letting any defender touch him. His dribbling is well good enough to pull that off. He can pick his way through a defense untouched, and has an automatic shot that will go in every time without effort. For those who like to skill, it doesn't get much better than this. Shoot from inside the box, outside the box, on the run, so be sure to get him a look to his strong side. He's automatic to his left

**Ronaldo:** Saved for last for a reason, 5 star dribbling, perfect ball control, perfect shooting and passing, 6'1"" with heading that rivals the best clinical CBs and even has a weak foot that won't give a second thought to pulling off a left footed strike from outside the box. I guess if you want to knock something, he doesn't defend, but why are you asking the player who already does absolutely everything else for your team to do that as well? Get 10 defenders and Ronaldo and you're still looking at an amazing team. While there's often argument over real world ability between 1A and 1B in the Ronaldo vs Messi debate, faster,,False

I saw someone else do this and it looked like fun.  These players are on XBOX.  I'm going to make you work a little harder though!  Rather than tell you which players I have

1. Tell me about the hole in your squad you are trying to fill.
2. Show us your current FUT record
3. Show/Tell us something nice you've done for someone recently.  Visual proof is a big plus.  Doesn't have to be on Reddit or Fifa.  Just want nice people to get nice players.

The brackets are all up to date. Idle players have been replaced and waitlists have been updated. If all users could please sign up on the website that hosts our brackets (challonge.com)


* **LATEST UPDATE**
Alright I just created the tournament brackets. Unfortunately they had to be limited to 32 for XBOX and 16 for PS3. I gave out spots in the tournament based on first come first serve. Those who were not included will be first on the list for the next tournament. If anybody fails to show up for this tournament

* PS3 Brackets: http://challonge.com/redditfutps3
* XBOX Brackets: http://challonge.com/redditfut360

Please contact your opponent directly through reddit to get his/her gamertag or psn username. Then arrange when you two will play. The loser of the first round matches should pay 2000 coins to the person they were beaten by. The 2nd round loser pays 4000 to the winner

* **UPDATED**
Once the tournament table is out

&gt;1. Who gets to be home team is up to you to decide before your game against your oponent

&gt;2. 2000 coin buy in

&gt;3. If any player attempts to photoshop the results of his match

&gt;4. All games will be given 3 days to be played. In case somebody can't play within those 3 days

&gt;5. The prize money (coins) will be alotted as follows: 1st place - 75%

&gt;6. Training cards on players (to improve their attributes) are NOT allowed. IF cards are allowed.

&gt;7. If a game ends in a tie

&gt;8. The winner is responsible for the EA tax on the prize money (meaning the loser only transfers over what he's owed. He must not include the tax amount.)

his name is camara
he's 6'2 or 6'3 so in CDM he will win many headers in attack and defence.
he has high strength and easily pushes attackers of the ball
with 83 pace he is quick enough to get foward and back easily
he's 21 years old so he has time to develop.
because he's only 70 overall you can buy him fairly cheap.
to me he is like a cheap version of yaya toure
i like to play him with a high defensive medium attack work rate so he can help out the defence
other players i would recommend and marco rojas (A league)
if this post does well i may do another post on a different player

",8,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fifa13/comments/19393y/scriptingmomentum_thread_again_yay/,"I don't generally post, but I felt that I should be sharing this. I've read a lot about scripting/momentum (match-fixing) on reddit and on other forums online, so I decided to conduct a simple experiment to prove or disprove it.

Before I say anything about the study, I've reached division 1 on Fifa 12 and Fifa 13 with my wins being 10 times more than my losses. I like playing on career mode more than playing online, I've been playing on legendary since Fifa 10. 

So the study itself, the game throws a shocking defeat at your team i.e. you lose to this relegation threatened or lower level team (cup). This is where the study starts: Using the rematch option, you play this same game 'n' number of times. If there wasn't any match-fixing by the game, you would expect to win this game 9 times out 10, since you are the much stronger team. What actually happens is the near opposite. You win 30% of time and lose/tie the rest. You can try changing your formation and doing things differently, but it will not matter, you will lose 70% of the time. 

The other study done during a season is getting yourself to a point where you lead by one goal with 10 minutes left. Note the number of tackles

Repeat for World Class and professional and you'll notice that these numbers change in your favour.

What I have concluded is that the AI cheats to make things interesting

When I comment on one of the FIFA subreddits it is usually to discuss tactics or give advice on formations/chemistry but today I wanted to start looking at the diverse mental impact that E-currency

I have been a FIFA player since World Cup '98. Prior to that I played world cup italia '90 on my mega drive, what happened was I lost a lot of real life money buying points for packs.

People buy packs for several reasons. Mostly however

I have gotten several good to decent players out of packs, I have purchased A LOT less packs in FIFA 13. Infact, I am mostly using my 2 free packs a week from pre-order and season ticket and that's it (as well as packs for winning tournys). The bottom line is, it is paying real money on top of the cost of a game is insane. You are literaly better off buying 300K+ coins from a coin seller because that is guaranteed product for your investment. You could spend double what it would cost you on coins for packs and make nothing. Maybe you'd pull 1-2 decent 40K ish players but the chances of pulling IF's is so damn low.

We want to believe

TL;DR - Buying packs can be fun, buy coins.

1350480768.0,11mn39,Tips to win more in Seasons,Gameraka,21,0,7,"Hi guys

In my second season in *Head to Head*

My first tip is to avoid urgency. I see many players applying too much pressure as soon as the game kicks off. This is not the best way to play Fifa 13 if you plan to dominate higher divisions. When you play like this

You must play *patiently*. I suggest you to take a look at your opponent for the first 15 minutes where you shouldn't be taking too much risk. Just try to stop his offense and try to keep the ball as long as you can. Now there are two types of players when you have the ball possession. Type 1 will just sit back and let you pass around

Type 1 is more dangerous. If he is sitting back, counter attack is really effective. So you should always be prepared for a counter attack when you have ball possession.

Type 2 player which is aggressive is easier unless you don't know how to pass the ball around. Try to make a couple of short passes and then suddenly lob the ball to the opposite wing where your winger is all free. Try to find spaces and once you do

If you find the space against an agressive player

To sum up, when you have the possession. 

See you soon with more tips... In my second post

01. Abolish the current league 'prestige' system and replace it with a new

02. When your Virtual Pro gets red carded in the ""Be A Pro"" mode of Career Mode

03. When you play a match in ""Be A Pro"" mode, make it mimic the mode where you play as the full squad.

04. Add more boots. Also

05. Create a flexible system that allows you to create and customize your club’s own alternative third kit. In real soccer/football

06. In the “Be A Pro” mode of Career Mode, managers should be able to change formations prior to a match (as well as mid-game) to try and gain a tactful advantage. At the moment, all managers in the game just stick to the club’s default formation regardless of how much of a disadvantage it puts them in.

07. Add more audio commentary. I’m tired of the announcers repeating the same silly things over and over again from games past.

08. Create more stadiums. Seriously.

09. Referees are often assigned kit colors that either directly mimic or resemble the kit colors of an opposing team. Establish a system that considers which colors each club is wearing so that the referee can stand out independently on the pitch with a unique color of his own (as opposed to blending in as a player).

10. Enhance the “storyline” aspect of career mode by not only adding more stories/interactions

11. In career mode

12. In career mode, in FIFA13, the role of captain serves absolutely no purpose. Captains in the game should have much higher chemistry with other players on the field and given more on-field abilities.

13. Add more cut-scenes and post-game footage. I’m tired of seeing the same exact scenes after winning a Cup take place. Create 3 or 4 variations, add additional commentary for Cup matches, thus embracing and assuring the importance of the Cup match value.

14. Add an option in the Virtual Pro accessories section that allows you to customize your Virtual Pro so that he only has gloves and/or long-sleeves in the winter season and/or ""snowy"" condition. This way

15. Create a new attribute: ""Diving Tendency."" It'll allow players like Neymar to play more like they do in real life.

16. In the ""Be A Pro"" mode of Career Mode, where you can receive numerous offers from any club interested in your services.

17. Reinstate the ""Player-Manager"" option in Career Mode

18. As Career Mode plays out season after season, do you expect to see Sir Alex Ferguson managing in 2022?

19. Give managers their own personalities; some may be more offensively driven whilst others may be more balanced

20. Rename the ""World Championship"" appropriately to the World Cup like it is in real life. Also, if it's in Germany, play in German stadiums, so on and so forth...

21. Create supporters sections in stadiums where you can clearly see more rowdy fans who actually set off smoke bombs after goals, etc. Give the ""die-hard"" supporters for clubs their own place in the stadium to help establish a more friendly (or menacing) home-field ""presence.""",,False,self,t5_2smu8,False,,

I'm talking about situations just outside the penalty area. Normally the opposition team has 10 men behind the ball in that area. You can't play through balls as it's too close to the keeper

I feel like if you take an early lead you are in such a good position, run half the length of the pitch, through ball to a quick striker and he's in on goal.

* **Rodrigo** is the first player that I would like to talk about. He is a Spanish striker from SL Benfica, and I will have him for probably another 3-4 years before he gets old, and I want to sell him. While he is quite expensive, he is definitely worth it, and when I sell him I will make triple my money back.

* **Taarabt** is the next player that I want to talk about. He has 5 star skills, but he is worth the 4 years that I will get out of him. His listed potential is only 83, but I have him at 85 already. I run a 4-3-3, and use him right in the center of the pitch.

* **Gündogan** is a CM coming from Borussia Dortmund at only 21 years old. He has 4 star skills, as my style of play revolves mostly around a through ball to a player making a run, and forcing a 1 on 1 with the goalkeeper.

* **De Gea** is without doubt my favorite goalkeeper on both Ultimate Team and Career Mode. He is pretty expensive because he is excellent, but it is *so* worth it. Some of the saves that he makes are completely ridiculous, and he is one of the instrumental forces on my team.

* **Marcelo** is a LB from Real Madrid. Although he is 24, and with his high attacking workrate, I have scored multiple goals with him down the pitch. Although his potential is only listed at 85, I have him at 87 already.

* **Diego Capel** is another Spaniard, makes for one of the best offenses on Fifa 13, in my opinion. I first used the two of them together on Ultimate Team with my cheap Spanish squad, and decided to bring them down to West Ham. Again, he is relatively old to start off (24), but the past 2 years with him have been outstanding. As I said before, a lot of my goals come from a quick through ball down the middle, or take on the goalkeeper in a 1 on 1 and score.

* **Ekiza** is a CB (and another Spaniard). He is one of my favorite CBs on the game

1. there must be no more than 6-7 pages of that player

2. make sure that the player that you are going to do trading in has a lot of varying prices

you'll also will need to set a maximum to wich you are going to buy, i make about 200-800 coins a player, and sometimes there are more than 40 players sold a day, and sometimes you'll wake up and check the web app only to find that 10 of the 40 players have been bought, OVERNIGHT!!!

just one small  tip: trading goes easier on the web app

also it's easier to start off with a much more desireable player

also when you have enough coins, and offentially they'll all sell with profit because the price of informs goes up over the weeks",,False,self,t5_2smu8,False,,

In this post I want to outline what I feel is a very important part of any community: Influence. Infulence is obtained by achieving certain things. For example, than someone who plays for fun/casual. Influence is not to be underestimated, as it is almost soley the cause of all of the ""meta"" conclusions that are drawn by hundreds of people on this subreddit everyday. For example, there is an unbelievable amount of hate for pace, or ""sweaty"" brazillian teams on this sub-reddit, because it's a hot topic. What people fail to acknowledge is that the trend stops with them for the most part because everyone has a different experience.

People come to this sub-reddit for advice, which makes him do something he ultimately had no intention of doing, just because someone told him to do it. In my (recent) experience, I purchased and built a team around Robben, tried him in 3 different formations (3-4-2-1, 4-3-3 and 4-3-2-1) and had a really indifferent time. Robben who I purchased for around 268,000, who costs almost a tenth of that

They treat it like the actual gameplay



* They've added form and happiness to players, there no way to filter a search for unhappy/out of form players.



* Transfers are still unrealistic



* Speaking of Barcelona



* On the topic of trading, some coming to the end of their careers in a season or two, but no one would come in for any of them, not even lower league clubs. These players sat in my reserves for a season and a half before I figured out I could just trade them as part of a deal and 80% of the time the club will accept.



* You can no longer invest in clubs facilities like in FIFA 10. This was a really cool feature



* There is no player interaction. Every now and then you'll get pop ups from players saying they want to start the next game or that they are unhappy and yet you can't respond to them, it would be stupid to play them, yet if you don't, after the game they'll bitch about it.

1. Ricky van wolfswinkel: 76-rated gold striker. all his stats are average at best but in-game it's a whole different story. His positioning, incredibly cheap, around 500 coins, what a bargain!!!

2.tim matavz: 74-rated silver striker. He may only have 75 pace and 2*skills but his positioning is great and his finishing is unreal. 4*weak foot meaning you can shoot from anywhere outside the box with either foot and the ball will just rocket in. Incredible shot power.

3.george wijnaldum: 76-rated gold cam. 86 pace

4.douglas: 77-rated gold center-back. I play a 3 back formation and he is the reason why I can. His heading and strength are incredible. He catches up to attackers and muscles them off the ball easily. He also scores tons of goals from corners.

-How through some amazing rebound or own goal

-How when playing on World Class or Legendary difficulty any player on the computer's team suddenly gets 99 dribbling and can waltz right through my defense

-How players in game don't reflect their real-life abilities.. Like how on Legendary some 60-rated winger can play like Ribery

-How when you get past the last defender and pass it to someone next to you you get called back for being offside

-How when you use the pass and move button to make a run an opponent can just smash your runner

EDIT: -How man-marking doesn't work at all and how sometimes your 90-rated CB just leaves the opponent with a huge hole to pass into when he fails to mark the attackers closest to goal

EDIT 2: -How rebounds are just magnetically attracted to your opponent's player who isn't running onto the ball but just standing there

I did this a while back in this thread which received great feedback and thought I would do it again because no doubt some people missed out and there's nothing stopping people who posted in the last one from posting again! I avidly play FIFA UT and surprisingly whilst the game is very fun (But also ridiculously frustrating) I enjoy designing and building teams more than I do playing in game.

The was this works is that you folks just copy and paste the format below (to make it easier for me and to be more efficient in getting the squad to you A.S.A.P) and I will go on Futhead.com and design a team. I will then post it as a reply and you give me feedback till i tweak it till it suits your needs.


**Format:**

* Formation: (Preferred formation(s)/Any)
* Budget: (An allocated budget/Unlimited)
* Platform: (Xbox360/PS3/PC)
* Hybrid: (Yes/No)
* Card Type: (Gold/Silver/Bronze/Mix)
* Specific Players: (Any players essential to the squad [The less there is
* Additional Info: (Any extra notes)


**Example:**

* Formation: 442
* Budget: 180K
* Platform: Xbox360
* Hybrid: No
* Card Type: Gold Only
* Specific Players: V.Kompany and Y.Toure
* Additional Notes: No non-rares

Hopefully you get the idea!
I look forward to the challenges and I hope you like the end results.

How is everyone else's manager mode going? and do you have any unique foals sent for your seasons?



  **Update 12/22**
I took over as Athletic Bilbao in the January transfer window of the 2019/20 season. They were in 7th place when I picked them up and I just won the league beating Madrid by 2 points. I won the Euro league against Napoli and the Spanish Cup.  6 months and I won the treble with Bilbao. I don't know if I should move on or build up Bilbao for another year. I also am now the manager of Brazil! woo!

Luiz Gustavo-25 y.o 6'2 Brazilian midfield monster!! strong

Alexander Merkel-21 y.o 5'9 German engine.. Can play anywhere in midfield and is a very balanced player.. Grows rapidly and is constantly improving in all areas of the pitch.. PRICE: 5-6mil

Oussama Assaidi-24 y.o 5'8 Moroccan trickster.. This man is an enigma.. When you look at his rating of 78 he doesn't look like much.. Then you start playing with him, his tendancy to pop up from anywhere and score goals.. Whether you dribble from your goal to your opponent's, or simply pass it off to him when he magically appears beside you when you need an option, Assaidi will score goals, and he will score plenty of them..

I avidly play FIFA UT and surprisingly whilst the game is very fun (But also ridiculously frustrating) I enjoy designing and building teams more than I do playing in game.
The was this works is that you folks just copy and paste the format below (to make it easier for me and to be more efficient in getting the squad to you A.S.A.P) and I will go on Futhead.com and design a team. I will then post it as a reply and you give me feedback till i tweak it till it suits your needs.


**Format:**

* Formation: (Preferred formation(s)/Any)
* Budget: (An allocated budget/Unlimited)
* Platform: (Xbox360/PS3/PC)
* Hybrid: (Yes/No)
* Card Type: (Gold/Silver/Bronze/Mix)
* Specific Players: (Any players essential to the squad [The less there is
* Additional Info: (Any extra notes)


**Example:**

* Formation: 442
* Budget: 180K
* Platform: Xbox360
* Hybrid: No
* Card Type: Gold Only
* Specific Players: V.Kompany and Y.Toure
* Additional Notes: No non-rares

As I said

The best part for me is the player personality part. I started a career as the manager of the NE Revolution (being from New England), you could give a contract to literally anyone and they will accept it no matter how much and how long. Just the personalities of the players was amazing to me.

Another part that I loved was that players get upset when you don't play them. In Madden, and it's really refreshing.

Seriously. I'm new to FUT in the sense that this years Fifa is the first time I've ever played it with dedication. I must admit its extremely addicting. I started out unsure of how to build a team with good chemistry, tried new formations, even built teams that were statistically superior to my first in every way. The problem was, I WASN'T WINNING ANYTHING anymore and I got extremely frustrated, to the point where I almost gave up on FUT all together. Yesterday I just said F--- this i'm going to go back to what worked in the beginning. I sold my squad and started resurrecting the team I was originally successful with, adding a couple tweaks here and there. After going 6-1-0 in my first season back with them I'm convinced that it's all about finding a team that you can get in a groove with. I tried all these different formations, but the moment I switch back to my original 4-1-2-1-2 I saw the championship results I was looking for. Not to mention I was dominating teams that were far more powerful on paper than my own. Sure, absolutely

It sucks because it seems like 100% of the people I come up against plays exactly like this with some kind of intense defensive setup. Am I just a terrible player? Anyone else have experience playing these kinds of people? Normally, lately, I know, not even feel, that I'm gonna lose. My players (or maybe me) can't pass for shit recently and I certainly can't skill around the defenders because they either perfectly predict everything I do, contain hard, or just hound my players.

I don't really want this to sound like I'm bitching (even though I am) so could some of you just share your experiences facing the kinds of players that park the bus right from the get-go and how you got past them? I think anything would help at this point as I can't even remember the last time I won and I've probably only won a few times in the past 20 or so games.

Now, the handicap is when your team (generally a higher rated/ higher chemistry squad) plays very poorly against a much weaker team.

I have lost and/or struggled versus a few weaker teams

Today, silver and gold mixed teams. I use a French/Italian hybrid rated 83 with 95-100 chemistry. I lost these matches 5-0, 
6-1

I tried telling myself that these 3 different FIFA players were very skilled compared to me, my defenders losing every tackle, and my typically strong Joe Hart letting long shots in so easily, I became a believer.

I looked up my opponents' player stats of futhead. What I found made no sense. Sure there were a few of his attackers with high pace, left-footed long shots like it was nothing. This one was the worst. Rojas was out-muscling Kaboul, and while under pressure, not fully facing goal, he launches one from 30 yards out. Hart got a piece of it, but he was no match for a rocket propelled torpedo.
