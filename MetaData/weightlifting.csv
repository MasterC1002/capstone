I caught a North Korean guy walking towards a bar loaded with multicolored weights. Seemed dull

And then, the usual place , the familiar position. The tension became palpable. ""Can he do it?"". I felt a surge of nervousness in my gut. The serious face becomes a grimace of fury as the bar explodes upwards and I caught myself shouting ""Go, go, go!"" as the North Korean spread his legs and ducked under the weight for the final part of the lift.

Finally

I was thrilled. ""He did it!"" The feeling was incredible

I immediately began to see how involving this sport can be. The purity of it all, and just what a surge of emotion must go through a sprinter's head when he's on the block about to run, but this... this was significant.

Most significant was my relation to the spectacle. The crowd's relation to the spectacle. The crowd doesn't root against any weightlifter, then fell silent to allow them to focus for the superhuman challenge ahead. And so did I.

Every single lift

Compared to this titanic and pure challenge

I became a fan. I can't wait for the world championships. This is by far my favorite spectator sport of all time. I wish more people would just see it. It is a thrilling

It also made me do the basic lifts at my gym. Now I'm passionate about lifting also.  I'm too old to be significant, another struggle. It's nice man.Hell of a sport. Can't wait to watch the world championships.",,False,self,t5_2rlwc,False,,

Thank you all for making this subreddit awesome!

Also

**Update 1:** With 25 competitors pledged

**Update 2:** I am going to start formatting this thread as the official start date thread (ie with the rules

**Rules**

**Snatch**
&gt; The barbell is placed horizontally in front of the lifter's legs. It is gripped
palms downwards and pulled in a single movement from the platform to the 
full extent of both arms above the head
legs. During this continuous movement
and the lap. No part of the body other than the feet may touch the platform 3
during the execution of the lift. The weight
maintained in the final motionless position
on the same line
the platform. The lifter may recover in his or her own time
or a squat position
plane of the trunk and the barbell. The referees give the signal to lower the 
barbell as soon as the lifter becomes motionless in all parts of the body. 

&gt; *From the IWF Technical Handbook*

**Clean and Jerk**

&gt;The first part
 The barbell is placed horizontally in front of the lifter's legs. It is gripped
palms downwards and pulled in a single movement from the platform to the 
shoulders
movement
must not touch the chest before the final position. It then rests on the clavicles 
or on the chest above the nipples or on the arms fully bent. The feet return to 
the same line
this recovery in his or her own time and finish with the feet on the same line
parallel to the plane of the trunk and the barbell. 

&gt;The second part
 The athlete bends the legs and extends them as well as the arms to bring the 
barbell to the full stretch of the arms vertically extended. He or she returns the 
feet to the same line; arms and legs fully extended
signal to replace the barbell on the platform. The referees give the signal to 
lower the barbell as soon as the lifter becomes motionless in all parts of the
body. 

&gt;**IMPORTANT REMARK:** 
 After the Clean and before the Jerk
barbell. This must not lead to confusion. It does not mean the granting of an 
additional jerk attempt but allowing the lifter to: 
a) withdraw the thumbs or “unhook” if this method is used
b) lower the barbell in order to let it rest on the shoulders if the barbell is 
placed too high and impedes the breathing or causes pain
c) change the width of the grip

&gt; *From the IWF Technical Handbook*

**Lift Submissions**

Each competitor must submit a video of them performing a single (1) Snatch, the submitted video must be the raw file from the video capture device. The lifter can take as many off-camera attempts as they like in order to hit a weight they are satisfied with. The videos must be shot from within +/- 30 degrees in front of the lifter ([shown here](http://i.imgur.com/iTNOKPb.png)). You cannot submit two videos for the same lift (ie if you are unsure if you pressed out a 160kg Jerk, you cannot submit a 150kg Clean and Jerk as well to be safe). A third video must be shown clarify the type of plates (kg/lb) being used, as well as the corresponding colours(black plates must be shown, legibly on camera). In any case of uncertainty regarding the weight on the bar *your attempt(s) will not count*. For this reason, you are advised to make it explicitly clear the weight on the bar, either before or after your attempt. A video of the lifter must also be submitted which clearly shows their face, youtube username, you will be disqualified if the problem is not ratified by means of a second confirmation submission within the timeframe.",t5_2rlwc

* Push press

* Paused jerk (pause in the dip for the jerk for about 2 seconds)

Post the weight you got up to in the comments


Hopefully this one is alright with everyone. Maybe we can take a vote here for what we want next week. Post some complexes in the comments and I can add them to a list.

Or if you guys don't want to vote for them next week. I could just choose one at random for each week. That could keep it interesting anyway. Just let me know what you want to do.

I hope to see some big numbers!

u/GrecoRomanStrength with a super nice set at 175lbs/80kg at 140lbs BW [seen here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3ykJ2nTVo&amp;feature=youtu.be)

u/Taunk  Hit 230lb/105kg at 240lb bodyweight. So that's a sinclair of 112.6.

u/humanlimbspool did it without the push press at 205lbs/~93kg

I was completely fried when I tried this. Did it with 185lbs easily, and the day before  I PR'd my clean and jerk with 125kg up from 120kg. It has been a successful week for me so far!

Why does something feel heavier/lighter one day, the CNS corresponds exactly to the force able to be produced?

It's actually kind of amazing the CNS seems to be one point with how it feels. (usually)

* 186cm 
* Training 4-5x a week since January 2
* Train for olympic lifting primarily (I also do high-school only PL meets)
* Second WL Meet (2 PL meets under my belt as well)
* Paleo from January to about June, rice etc) edit: also whole milk
* Multivite, Optimum Platnium Pre before each workout
* I've been training so hard to try and get a 202kg total to qualify for Nationals  and I end up entering the competition with a 207kg training total


**Meet Prep**

* The wednesday prior to this meet, I weighed 91kg, so I knew I'd have to do some serious water loading.
* Thursday I drank 13-14L of water (I stopped counting after 12) and ate only lean protein. Friday I ate ~500g chicken thighs with Ms. Dash all up in those thighs
* Friday night I was 191 on my gym scale (slightly heavy) so I knew I was good
* I slept a total of 2-3hours and that really messed with my head
* After weighing in at 84kg
* was going to go balls out and open with a 91kg snatch and hope for a 111kg CJ to qualify (ie open with the lifts needed to qualify to get 3 chances, so that didn't happen.


**The Lifts**	

Went 3/6 on my lifts

Video Soon

**Snatch**

* 80kg - Miss
* 80kg - so relieved I got this
* 85kg - no lift

**Clean and Jerk**

* 102kg - I use ammonia in training sometimes
* 102kg
* 107kg 


**Results**

Walked out with a **187kg total** 

**Records**

Broke no PRs or federation records
Competition PRs all around

**Final Thoughts**

* Happy I hit comp PRs
* I need to work on getting a more consistent snatch
* Next WL meet is February 9

I'm hopeful that I can work towards being able to do the lifts

To a specific point: I do have a ""form check"" video for a power clean (the only thing I seem to be able to do right now with any success) and I would be very grateful for any input, or perhaps even a counter-argument that I should be doing something else).  Fair warning; I am not a pretty picture- I don't  have any of the appropriate equipment, and I can't get myself low for a pull from the floor.  I'm 6'2, currently about 135Kilos (298-300 lbs) and I believe the weight in the video is about 80Kilos (175lbs).  One thing I'd mention that you can't really see from the angle, is that I'm starting to have an excessively wide foot stance on the catch.  Not quite sure why it started.

I train every day after class for about 2-2.5 hours. Sometimes I find myself at the gym for 3 hours if I spend time bull shitting with my lifting buddies. Come home and work on homework until I go to bed. This is my routine every day. Last week I took two days off from training to prepare for exams and I got so much more done. I felt like complete scum of the earth for skipping two days of training

Anyways I'm a bio major, I love the sport way to damn much, despite the fact that all of my family and friends want me to train less to focus more on school. Anyways the point of this post is to ask two questions: 

1: Any full time students out there balance school and training? How do you do it?

2: Does weightlifting hold any value on a grad school application? By the time I apply to grad school I will have a USAW level 1 (Getting it in june) And I will have experience working part time as a coach at my gym (I'll be coaching intro classes). I will also hopefully had competed in 4-5 national level meets (Assuming I qualify for nationals this year my competition total is 4kg away).

Some of you may remember a topic some months ago about [the politics of weightlifting](http://www.reddit.com/r/weightlifting/comments/16lkyr/the_politics_of_weightlifting_glenn_pendlay/), had never actually been used. You can look at it yourself in the [Athlete Handbook [PDF]](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCwQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.teamusa.org%2F~%2Fmedia%2FUSA_Weightlifting%2FDocuments%2F2013%2520Qualifying%2520Documents%2FAthlete%2520Handbook%2520and%2520Reference%2520Guide%2520for%25202013%2520International%2520Competition.pdf&amp;ei=HiPoUfiXGtLl4AOijIDYCA&amp;usg=AFQjCNF3OMF2FmSjBYKAX0m2W7wE_65IVA&amp;sig2=fPjViA0ZWV67CfdDBca6qA&amp;bvm=bv.49478099,d.dmg&amp;cad=rjt), the relevant sections being part of 10.4 and 10.5.

It's a little complicated, for example, Ian Wilson is not ranked, because he did not beat Donovan Ford's or David Garcia's totals at 105, even though he would otherwise be #8 on the list. Neither is Colin Burns, who would be #9, and instead the 8th man is currently James Tatum with the top 77kg total.

This matters because the only people eligible to attend the OTC camp and Trials are the two alternates and anyone ranked ahead of them. The top 6 men and 5 women are considered to have a ""lock"" on their spots (the USAW post says 8 and 7, so will not need to attend.

Two more competitions remain to determine the Trials-eligible athletes: Senior Nationals, however, David Garcia and James Tatum would have the option of defending their spots against Ian Wilson, Kevin Cornell, Cameron Swart, Spencer Moorman, and Darrel Barnes (Burns is left out because Cooper and Nackoul are already locked in at 85, although I don't know if that's allowable anyway). Kelly Rexroad Williams and Vanessa McCoy would similarly have the option of defending against Breanne Bassler Havard and Ellen Kercher.

Got it? If not

I was requested to write this in part because there's some hubbub going on since the announcement yesterday - there are some very negative responses from coaches on the news post linked at the top, others are unhappy about the OTC Trials concept itself, and still others don't like the idea of there being so many competitions so close to Worlds.

I will attempt not to editorialize, often at the last minute. Members of the Board have said there is an open process where people are aware of what's happening and have input well in advance. I'm not here to tell you who is right. The Athlete Handbook does claim there was a comment period from January 1st to 8th for this year's rules and procedures, and it's true comments can be made anytime.

Been trying to train the olympic movements for the past 6 months consistently. Don't really have access to a coach until Saturdays. I lift in a commercial gym monday-friday at 5am. Saturdays i train in a crossfit gym at 7a. Been following this schedule for the past 4 months. This was my first competition. I take whey protein

Been following the Waxman WOD program. I find it to be really helpful, i use Saturdays as my ""max out"" so to speak, to really take it up.

I kept my schedule pretty consistent. The week before

Noone ever seems to include dosage with the recommendation. I have heard some wildly different answers from different people (70sbig, us-fda, the label on the bottle, etc).  None of the dosages are consistant.  So my question is, how much do you take and why do you take that particular dosage?

Much Thanks

1360018251.0,17w7s6,Meet Report: 2013 Colorado State and Open Weightlifting Competition.  (Sorry no video),hosemonkey,18,2,3,"This was my first USAW meet.  I weighed in at 91.1 two hours before the competition.  Because it was my first I didn't want to worry about gaining or cutting weight in the time leading up to the event so I just competed in the most comfortable weight class for me (94).  

Snatch:

* Attempt 1: 100.  Made it comfortably.
* Attempt 2: 105.  Made it very comfortably.  Actually was technically a power snatch.  
* Attempt 3: 110.  Missed.  I originally planned on 108 but my coach and I agreed that I was feeling strong enough for the 110.  This would tie a training pr.  I didn't quite finish my 2nd pull and it put the bar in front enough that I couldn't save it.  But I was happy with the 105.

Clean and Jerk

* Attempt 1: 131. Miss due to equipment malfunction.  I popped the Velcro on my Valeo belt and it hit the floor.  I guess that counted as a part of me touching the platform so no lift.  I also moved up to 131 from 130 because of a mis-timed warm up lift as I was supposed to go out to the platform (2 lifters in front of me jumped up in weight too without me realizing.)  So the extra kilo bought me another 3 minutes which was perfect.
* attempt 2: 131
* attempt 3: 136

241 total.  Surprisingly this was good enough for a podium spot at 3rd place out of about 13 lifters.  I was pretty excited about that and my 2 year old daughter loves the medal they gave me.  


Lessons learned:  
* Having a coach/manager to tell you when and how much to warm up with was awesome.  Definitely not something I want to worry about on my own.
* CHECK YOUR EQUIPMENT - I feel like I had 140 in me for the C&amp;J

One advocates catching as high as possible during the full snatch/clean

The other methodology advocates pulling only high enough so that you can get under the bar

Personally, but if I do all my warm-up weights catching high and riding down I have a really hard time transitioning into a low catch position. I keep trying to catch everything high.

* 5’9″ – 89.6kg – 26 years old.  Didn’t do any kind of cutting whatsoever.
* 1st weightlifting meet after 2 months of Oly training
* Supplements:  Vitamin D (5000IU), Melatonin (3g), Creatine (5g)

Started to pick up weightlifting right after my last powerlifting meet (in March 2013).  My plan was to ease into the sport and try to keep a 50/50 balance between powerlifting and weightlifting, there was no reason not to.

The majority of my training went on a 4 day a week schedule

Sunday

* Heavy Snatch (go for PR
* High bar squat 3 x 5

Monday

* Light C&amp;J (usually worked up to around 100kg for a lot of singles)
* Front Squat 3 x 3

Tuesday

* Light Snatch (worked up to around 70 kg)
* High bar squat 3 x 5

Thursday

* Heavy C&amp;J (best PR was 120kg)
* Front squat 3 x 3

**Meet Prep**

No real issues in terms of meet prep.  For tapering, my gym PRs were 94kg snatch and 120kg clean and jerk.  I remember hitting 70kg snatches perfectly weeks before tapering, but then having trouble hitting 70kg in my taper.  Can’t really point as to why this would be, but I am sure it’ll uncover itself in the future.

In two years of powerlifting

**The Lifts**

[VIDEO](http://youtu.be/34vaxExpNEI)

Went 3/6.  Extra thanks to my sister for taking video!  My camera for whatever reason did not work

**Snatch**

* 85KG, and the bar kept moving forward on the pull.  Some nerves.  Overall, snatches just did not feel right.
* 85KG
* 90kg

**Clean and Jerk**

* 110KG, should have dropped my hips a bit more.
* 115KG
*  115KG, so stuck with 115kg.  Went up fine.

**Results**

Ended with a total of 200 kg (441 lb) at 89.6 kg

**Final Thoughts**

* Not the way I wanted to start my weightlifting career.  Mostly came from having nerves and just not getting the right mindset the week before.  I know I mostly need more experience
* Great to see some of the high-level lifters at this meet.  In particular
* This was the first time I had really watched video of myself in my lifting.  I noticed some errors I would have caught before if I had been watching more video
* Got a lot to work on
* I don’t have a meet planned out now, I’m going to put the majority of my training in weightlifting, and give myself one day a week for some of the powerlifting movements.  If I get another weightlifting meet scheduled this year, I’ll drop the powerlifting work.

My training plan for the future is as follows:

Sunday

* Heavy C&amp;J
* Front Squat (3×3)

Monday

* Light Snatch (20 minutes/10 reps)
* Squat (3×5)
* Snatch Balance (3×5)

Tuesday

* Light C&amp;J (20 minutes/10 reps)
* Front Squat (3×3)
* Jerks (triples)

Thursday

* Heavy Snatch
* Squat (3×5)

Friday

* Light Snatch
* Bench (3 x 5)
* Deadlift (1 x 5)",self,t5_2rlwc,1369140384.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightlifting/comments/1epa24/meet_report_michigan_weightlifting_championships/

33 years old, got bit by the bug, have been training pretty hard in parking lots on my lunch break w/ my own equipment.  Found out about this meet earlier this month and decided to do it just for the experience.

**Meet Prep**

I spent June doing the 6-week ""russian squat program"" you see all over the internet and afterwards was focusing on strength in the lifts, ended up hitting a [PR 100kg snatch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJTJI6Jz7Uo) 2 days later, a week before the meet. 

1 week out I was feeling really strong and definitely felt capable of at least 100 on snatch and 120+ on CJ.

Unfortunately my low back &amp; pelvis started really bothering me that weekend, I tweaked my back really bad doing my snatch opener of 90kg.  I spent the next 2 days resting and trying my best to rehab my back.

**The Meet**

Don't remember my exact weight but it was about 81kg.

Found a guy warming up who was opening about the same as me and he had 6 or 7 meets under his belt so I kind of followed his lead on warmups

Ended up going 4/6 and making a CJ PR and ended up with 3rd place.  Pretty happy about that for my first meet!
Here's the full video of all 6 lifts:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLKS5PgesnY

**Snatch:**

* 90kg: make - nerves were going nuts but the bar went up relatively easy
* 96kg: make - I honestly don't remember a single thing about this lift
* 101kg: miss - would have been a 1kg PR, because my position at the knees is still good enough to have at least attempted the lift.  Oh well.
	
	
**Clean &amp; Jerk**

* 110kg: make - Pretty straightforward lift
* 117kg: make - Forgot to bring my feet in before the jerk
* 121kg: miss - Did not have the legs to stand up with this one.  I think I was just shot at this point
	
**Lessons learned**

Had a great time!  I wish my back was at 100% but who knows if it would have made much of a difference; my meet total was only 2.5kg less than my training total so I'm pretty happy overall.  There are a couple places where I know it made a difference: the first being that I changed my whole setup (taking time to brace my trunk carefully for my back's sake) and starting stance to a more toes forward stance to support my hips better based on reading Kelly Starrett's book before the meet (which I feel actually helped)


My brain thought it was done after the snatch portion.  It was tough to get amped up to go again.  I'm used lifting all in about an hour on my lunch break


I lost 2nd place by 1kg, good for him.  I didn't go in with any plans for strategy, just to make my lifts, so I can't complain.  But I'll know for next time to pay attention to the cards.  It was just hard to follow since all the weight classes were in the same session.


This was the first time I've ever lifted around anyone else

1374787123.0,1j1yvf,Smolov Jr. Front Squat Review,c4lmlikeab0mb,18,4,10,"After seeing [ephrion's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/weightlifting/comments/1gshjj/program_review_smolov_jr_for_front_squats/) about this here

Before I started:

I was just experimenting for fun, I took about a week off squatting then started this.

My max front squat was 335lbs

Had to push myself to 110% pretty much every day. Started wrapping my knees going into the 2nd week. My squats started getting to be less of a ROM

When I finished I took 4 days completely off, my legs just couldn't push through. 

This week I've been going to a daily max backsquat. They feel more or less the same as before I started doing the 20 rep squats. They're also starting to help my knees feel better. My best squat is 380, in the morning on an empty stomach. That felt pretty good, I failed 365 shortly after. Didn't expect to get it, just wanted to see how it felt. 

So I guess my max front squat is around the same as my back squat right now. The 340lb front squat felt about the same as the 335lb back squat. 

I'll see how things turn out over the next couple of weeks.

With almost a year of training since my first competition, TueThurSat are my pulls and squats days. I train in New York, on Long Island in Garden City. 

**Meet Prep**

Two Weeks before this meet, and just acted like another training day, and hit 85/110 there. Not great, not bad. 
My tapering was simple, 100kgx3 in the CJ. Tuesday was off, Wednesday was light, 70/90, Thursday spent driving down, Friday was 75/95. 

My recovery and sleep was good. My weigh in was at 6am for that Saturday, normally I sit at 142~. I felt no loss of strength or anything, just a bit hungry. 

**The Meet**

The Friday before the meet I did some lifts. They felt good. Not amazing

After a successful weigh-in, drank water, foam rolled a bit, then went back to the venue. 

I start warming up, and make it, but much too difficult. After a moment, I decide to take 80kg once more. I miss it aggressively behind. Right after that miss behind, I have to take my first Snatch at a National Meet...

**Snatch**

1.  [85kg Successful Lift](http://youtu.be/vamxrSSO0xs?t=21m27s) Even though I just missed something easy

2. [90 kg Unsuccessful Lift](http://youtu.be/vamxrSSO0xs?t=26m30s) I made 90 a lot in training. I should have had this

3. [90kg Succesful Lift](http://youtu.be/vamxrSSO0xs?t=28m44s) This one was close. I was lucky they didn't red light it

Snatches should have been better. But I'd take it. The 90kg put me in 2nd place.

**Clean and Jerk**
Warming up again was good. I've made 115kg in training, because warming up, before I'm about to go out, I missed my 100kg jerk.

[105kg Successful Lift](http://youtu.be/vamxrSSO0xs?t=1h14m2s) Easy clean

[110kg Successful Lift](http://youtu.be/vamxrSSO0xs?t=1h18m) Jerk a little unstable

[115kg Unsuccessful Lift](http://youtu.be/vamxrSSO0xs?t=1h25m59s) Argh!!! I hate missing jerks with such easy cleans. I can usually clean very easy

**Results**

Jeffery Walters made a very close attempt at a 117 CJ, but 2nd place at my first National meet was very thrilling!!!

I can and will get better. Right after these lifts,,False,self,t5_2rlwc,False,,True

My search so far has turned up these gyms relatively close to where we're staying:

San Fran - Worlds Gym

Vegas - Average Broz

Austin - Hyde Park Gym

From Austin we'll be heading to New Orleans then driving (over a few days or so) to New York. This leg of the trip hasn't been fully planned so I'm not sure where we're stopping yet. It'd be great if anyone has suggestions for me.

We call the gym Cambridge Strength and Conditioning. It's ~1mile from alewife T-station and rt 2 so it's pretty convenient to drive and or bike here. We also have plenty of parking at the warehouse (pictures/videos/directions) are on facebook below.

**Schedule:** We currently work out Mon, Sat and start at 6PM except Sat which is usually 10AM -1PM. Some of us are doing Texas Method and others are doing SS/misc. Our group is generally comprised of being just interested in strength training or ultimate frisbee/rugby players looking for weight training.

Two of us have been to the SS seminar and have also done the USA Weightlifting level one certification. We have goals of doing a raw powerlifting event at the end of July and a weightlifting event at a later time

**Equipment:** We have 2 squat racks, 2000+ pounds of iron, two olympic platforms (8x4 and 8x8), pendlay , york, B&amp;R, misc barbells, pull up bar station, stereo with epic music

Here's a web site we just put up cambridgestrength.com but we mostly use facebook.

We aren't looking to make money, and get the rent paid. Also we have one female that trains with us every session and another 3 that drop in from time to time.

I know very well where these problems are coming from. It's because I've been trying to perform really deep squats without having the proper flexibility to perform one. 

What I actually wanted to bring up is if tall people can have a good squat, I can't do a pistol squat at all and the thing is that I don't if its my body dimension/mechanics that doesn't allow it or if I'm really inflexible. I have a friend who's shorter than me and he can perform pistol squats and he hasn't even been in a gym and he probably hasn't stretched in the last 5 years.

Basically I'm wondering if its possible to achieve these really upright squats we see oly lifters do as a taller person. Has anyone dealt with the same problem? Bear in mind I've only been doing weightlifiting for about three months or more.  

Right now I'm only doing front squats because they allow my back to stay injury free. Although right now I'm dealing with hip flexor pain because of wide stance. Thing is

**Training**

Very straightforward.  3 days a week.  

* Day 1: Snatch, snatch pulls

* Day 2: Clean, clean pulls

* Day 3: Snatch

I am also a dirty dirty crossfitter so I do several conditioning type wods during the week around my lifting.  Usually between 3-4 ""wods"" on top of weightlifting. 

The cycle was pretty straight forward as well.  3 months out was lots of volume as heavy as I could stand (think sets of 8).  2 months out slightly lower volume with lightly more weight (sets of 5). 1 months out everything went to sets of 3 but higher weight again.  Followed a pretty basic super-compensation structure from week to week.  (80%, 95-100%).  


**Meet Prep**

Two weeks out I was horribly sick and  I was pretty discouraged because I figure I had wasted all my hard training by missing my last heavy week in the cycle. That was pretty silly thinking my me.  At the advice of /u/olympic_lifter the meet is a culmination of all training

1 week out I still used as a taper week.  only 3 workouts the whole week

* 102 - Miss - Got a little jumpy on the first lift.  tried to pull way to fast off the ground and just had sloppy form.  

* 102 - Make - Calmed down and hit this very easily

* 107 (meet pr) - Make - Same very easy make for me.  Although it was a meet pr

Clean &amp; Jerk:

* 134 - Make - definitely a big opener for me but I felt great warming up and made the lift easily on the platform.

* 139 - Make - I thought I pressed out on the top but the judges let me have it with 3 whites.  Thanks.

* 144 - Make - All time pr! previous was 143 in practice.  Previous meet pr was 136.  Very excited about this one.  

* 251 total was good enough for 1st place in the 94's and a 10 kg total meet pr for me.  


**lessons learned**

* Calm the f*ck down. - despite being sick and missing a full week

Had a great time.  Many of my compadres had a great meet as well.  I can't wait to do it all again.

Here's the link: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxfTEkaDmok](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxfTEkaDmok)

China is the subject of much discussion, our 62kg records are behind that of other classes, most likely because we don't have as many people that small in this country, but for comparison that would be similar to opening at more than 180kg in the 77s or well over 200kg at 94kg. That's a minimum A session total of over 300kg. At 62kg.

To be fair, and their 77A session started with 175kg and 85A started with 180kg, both comparatively weaker. But to get an idea of just how good their 62s are, if Kendrick had been a 62kg lifter he'd be lucky to be able to qualify for China's A session. Chad Vaughn might have made it in his heyday, but probably not.

Another thing: for all the guys like Lu Xiaojun and Zhang Jie who can always easily front squat their cleans

Last, was split jerking. I didn't quite count, but if split jerks weren't the majority, they were at least a plurality (there were power jerks, too). I would be curious to see an analysis of the percentage of made split jerks vs percentage of made squat jerks.

Remember, steroids alone could never make up this difference, and there's no magic bullet for training. Participation, more than anything else, is the difference between us.

Thoughts?

I was debating about my new year's resolutions and I wanted to start training for specific weightlifting competitions.  I miss the competitive aspects of races in college and even the Crossfit Games Open.  I have no intention yet of winning but I think it would provide structure to my year and something fun to train for.  When is a good time to start thinking about meets?
Is a weightlifting meet even an appropriate place for the dedicated enthusiast with no Olympic dream?  I assume its more selective than a local 5k or marathon but don't have a frame of reference.

If you're familiar with Takano's theories or programming at all, meaning lots of complicated programs, prescribed volumes and intensities, etc. 

The book starts with a basic review of biology, etc. Being a biology/chemistry geek, much of this wasn't particularly new or interesting to me, but I think it's a good review and probably needs included in the book. If these ideas are new to you, you will probably find it quite helpful, as it does establish a theoretical basis for much of the programming to follow. 

Mr. Takano is a big believer in Russian programming, Class I, Candidate for Master, etc... He includes training rational and sample programming for each class of trainee. This is far more detailed than anything posted on his website. 

For example, recommend exercises, volume and intensity, long-term planning, etc. He also provides a sample 4-week loading program and 4-week pre-competition program. I found this training to very closely follow the Medvedyev programming. But if you've ever read the Medvedyev stuff, you know it can sometimes read like stereo instructions. It is not well organized. Mr. Takano is very good at taking this information and laying it out in understandable and applicable ideas and programs. 

After going through each class of lifter specifically, and some coaching guidance and tips. The discussion on restoratives focuses on non-pharmacological therapies like massage, jacuzzi, contrast showers, etc. I found this section helpful, but would have preferred a more evidence-based discussion. For example, why exactly is a pine needle bath going to help me? Has this been studied

Overall, there also does seem to be a reduced incidence of major injury with Russian programming. Regardless, the book is quite informative, and I would recommend it if you're at all interested in weightlifting programming. ",,False,self,False,t3_14g3ck

My weakest lift is Jerk.  It really frustrates me that my weakest lift is technically easier than Snatch and Clean.  I'm of the the belief that if you make your Clean easy you should be able to nail your Jerk.  Not with me

I always struggle with the speed aspect of the lift.  In order to get vertical drive on the bar I can sometimes be too slow pushing my front leg forward enough thus leaving my back leg too straight which in turn pushes me hips behind the bar.  To compensate I can sometimes dive too quickly under the bar without putting enough into the drive phase.
  
I also have problems staying on my heels for the drive phase - I think about this too much and need it to be more automatic.

Today, so I could work the full ROM at a lower warm-up weight.  I did five reps at 53, so I put the bumpers back on the 45lb bar, and did 3 reps at 65 lbs.  Still felt a little off balance at the top, but not too bad, so I upped the weight to 70 lbs.  Nailed my squat, and stood it back up with ease.  For the first time, fluent movement.  For the first time

80 lbs also felt good for two reps, I tried that, and it flew up even more smoothly.  I was going to call it a day, but the lure of putting 25lb bumpers on the bar called me to try another set.  I loaded up 95 lbs, and figured there would be no harm in another 5 lbs, to get into three digit weights.  

I stepped up to the bar, and pulled the weight up.  Didn't feel quite as smooth, but it came up, I got under the bar, and hit a solid snatch.  On the second rep, I didn't get it fully overhead, but close enough that I could stand it up

Two solid reps at 100 lbs

On the jerk, I'm not worried about locking out the bar, so I take the time I need to get to a nice deep split. As the weights get heavier, I get more worried that the bar is going to be coming right back down on me, so I rush the split, don't split as deep, and fulfill my own prophesy.

How does your split depth change with the weight on the bar? Do you split deeper as the weight gets heavier, how do you adjust? Do you know how deep you're going to split before you start the jerk? If you fuck up the dip'n'drive, can you, on the fly, split deeper to save it?

1371818522.0,1gshjj,[Program Review] Smolov Jr for Front Squats,ephrion,10,0,9,"I initially posted this as a link to my blog

**Initial Information:**

Before starting this, but I had done a lot of training for powerlifting and hadn't tested my max.  I calculated my weights using 245 max, as I tend to find that I can lift more than my rep maxes would indicate.

**More stats:**

5'10""/M/195lbs

Front Squat: 255lbs (Jan 11th

Low bar squat: 352lbs (at a meet on April 20th)

High bar squat: 295lbs (tested on April 30th

Deadlift: 402lbs (at a meet

**Thoughts During The Program:**

When I made the spreadsheet and initially looked at the program, but in every instance, I was able to finish the sets.  It was pretty damn hard.

I added 10lbs for the second week

I did more mobility and flexibility work than usual, but were fine the day after.

**Diet:**

I did intermittent fasting.  Coffee, peanut butter, whey for lunch.  Chicken, eggs, veggies, and rice for dinner.  Also pizza and ice cream once a week.  Aiming for a recomp or cut.

**Results:**

Front squat 1RM: 255lbs belted to 285lbs beltless. I belted up and attempted 300lbs twice

Front squat 3RM: 225lbs to 227.5lbs... for 10 sets.

Bodyweight: Gained one pound

Thighs: Started at 24"" and went to 25""

Clean PR went from 215lbs to 220lbs (after missing it 7 times). 

**Thoughts on the Results:**

I feel like I could have made 300lbs if a) I had rested a week instead of a few days, I didn't do those things, so I just have a PR of 30lbs.  I'm pretty happy with that. 

I think that lowballing my max was a good idea.  Working off a lower max than my real PR helped me get all the work in without pushing myself to give 100% every session.  It's possible that my gains could have been better with a higher max

How did this affect my back squat, but I haven't tested.  I'm still in an acclimation phase for weightlifting, after injuring my wrist coming into it too quick, but I tested a max clean and attempted a 5lb PR 8 times before finally making it.  So the strength difference between my max clean and my max front squat went from 84% to 77%.

I really enjoyed the program,False,self,t5_2rlwc,False,,,t3_1gshjj

Just got  hold of a video from my most recent comp last month in Glasgow
With hindsight
I'd competed a few times prior to this comp with pbs of about 110/130. This comp was the 1st one I'd taken seriously and began this 12 week program ( http://www.catalystathletics.com/workouts/cycle.php?cycleID=45) to prep for it. I really enjoyed the leg strength phase but found myself becoming a bit fed up with the comp prep part. I just felt my heart wasn't in it for some reason. 

Diet wise

Pbs in training running up the comp were 120 snatch

One the day I went;
120x
120
125x

140xxx

Was really disappointed with myself for 1) opening too big for my jerk ability and 2) not training the jerk enough and relying on comp nerves to get it up!

If I made my openers

Future training. Get the 125 and really train the jerk. I feel I should be getting 125/155 at current strength levels. 

Next time!

I read through Greg Everett's book and Im following through that while I do Pendlay's beginner program. 

To my question, but my shoulder hurt, and oddly enough so did my elbow. 

As far as my doctor and PT specialist said, everything from I should just avoid snatches alltogether (due to the precarious position a proper overhead squat puts you in) because the scar tissue is never strong enough, to the exact opposite that scar tissue can be stronger then the original tear.

I feel no real pain perse when overhead squatting. I feel pain when I screw up my second pull and just muscle it over my head instead of properly scarecrowing and using knee+hip extension.

TLDR: My question is, I love the technical aspect of it as opposed to just mindless benchpressing and rows that I've done in the past and its been a real good motivator for me.

Essentially my clavicle has detached from my sternocliestomastoid muscle of my neck. The muscle however is still attached to the sternum.

I find when I concentrate on jerking straight up and behind my head I lose power, I think of certain cues, I know what I have to do to perform the lift correctly, same with the clean. But when I approach the jerk, there is just so much running through my mind, and I just cant generate as much force when trying to concentrate on the movement. And when I do generate enough force, I end up enforcing my bad habbit of a forward jerk. Also, but in training Ill be lucky if I can ever work up to 110. I only seem to make heavy jerks in competition!

Below are some videos of some of my clean and jerks. Note the video of the local meet my snatches were forward, the second video is an older meet from september. Note the 120kg jerk attempt at the end. If I jerked it a little bit more straight overhead I would not have had to fight to save it.

Does basic kettlebell exercises carry over at all? Or is that time better invested in technique grinding as well?

* 81kg - no lift

**Clean and Jerk**

* 98kg - training PR is 107kg. felt good
* 102kg - I think I missed this b/c I kept my front foot forward for too long after the jerk
* 107kg - pressout


**Results**

Walked out with a **175kg total** and (Technically) the #1 Junior in my class

**Records**

Broke no PRs or federation records

**Final Thoughts**

* Pretty disappointed in myself
* I was really working on getting a more consistent snatch and my nerves really messed with my head during that part of the compeition
* Next WL meet is February 9

My question is, and what I currently have come up with is:
warmup to about 80%, 3 sets of singles and than 4-5 backoff sets of doubles with 85 &amp;80% . 

And then add about 2.5% on the oly lifts each week?

Does this sound good?

So
Monday(heavy): squat 5x5,85,90% 
Wednesday (light): squat 4x5 (low weight),85,90%  
Friday (heavy): squat 4x5, Bench same, c&amp;j same as monday.  
Next Monday = +2.5 on c&amp;j

Next to that
Yes I know this isn't optimal and that there are better programs avaible

Currently my stats are (1RM in kg):
backsquat 140
bench 85-90
DL 185
OHP  ~57.5
Clean&amp;Jerk 85kg 
Snatch about 70kg
and this at a BW of 85kg (~14% BF)

My understanding is that during the second pull the combination of ankle, as well as shrugging of the shoulders is what gets the weight moving upwards quickly, with most of the contribution coming from hip extension. I'm looking for insight on how hip extension translates into an upward force on the bar, since the hips move horizontally.

In trying to learn how to clean I've developed a habit of smacking the bar against my thighs violently in order to get the bar moving quickly. This seems to work

So if not thigh smacking then how exactly ""should"" I get the weight moving upward quickly?",self,t5_2rlwc,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightlifting/comments/1klloh/im_looking_to_understand_how_the_weight_is/

At first I thought the maths were going to be hairy (1 year out of uni and I'm already losing my edge!) but it turned out to be deceptively simple.

For women to compare yourself to men, then multiply it by 472/328 (= 1.44).

For example

So 251 * 1.31 * 1.44 = 475 ... which is just slightly more than Rezazadeh's 472 WR.

For an example closer to home

The woman's ""sex-adjusted"" sinclair is 1.24 * 1.44 = 1.79

Snatch: 205 (miss) 205 (make) 225(miss) 

-The 205s were easy weights for me.  I chalk the 1st miss to jitters.  I hit 215 easily in the warm up area so I went a little bigger for my last lift.  I will have to see the pictures to see what went wrong there but it wasn't close.

Clean and jerk: 255 (miss) 285  (miss) 285 (miss)
No idea what happened here.  I went with 255 as an opener because it is a sure thing for me.  Apparently I was wrong.  I had a small press out and got no repped. 285 should have been a sure thing.  This is not a hard c&amp;j for me.  I actually can't remember the last time I failed 285 in practice

One thing I didn't like about this meet was they set the rotation based on weights (lighter to heavier)

So lessons learned:
-A ""sure thing"" lift doesn't really exist for a meet.
-Go to a sanctioned meet because they will do something goofy if the rules aren't in place.
-practice more.

Everything went up. I managed to power clean and jerk my max clean and jerk, so I was stoked. 

I highly recommend everyone to at least give this approach a try and see how you feel, and I'm usually pretty dead after training, this is an awesome feeling.

5'9"" 84-85kg bw. Currently training 4 times per week, so my training has been scaled back to account for that. I also lost a bit of strength with my weightloss so I am putting the little time I have towards squats and pulls to get back some of that strength. I have made several technical changes to my pull technique and while I was spending time in different cities I have gotten input from a few other coaches and I think the small tweaks I've made to my pull are starting to show. This will be my 2nd meet this year, although this is not a qualifying meet for nationals so it is essentially just for fun. 

**Meet Prep**

I had no meet prep and just began my re-buidling cycle two weeks ago. Even though I am in horrible shape, so I just did the meet in lieu of my training program this weekend. I'll repeat this week of my program next week to get in the weekend training days.

**The Lifts**

Went 5/6:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHUaiGuHNXI

*Snatch*

90KG make: This was 10kg lighter than my opener at my last meet. I just came work up to a decent heavy single at this meet.

95KG make: Pretty routine.

100KG make: I haven't lifted anything over 100kg since my last meet in February


*Clean and Jerk*

115KG make: Moved up my planned opener from 110 because I mistimed my warmups and 100 felt lighter than expected so I did 110 in the back moved my opener up to 115. 

120KG make: I haven't cleaned over 117 since my last meet in Feb

125KG miss: Followed myself on this one. Got pinned in the bottom of the clean

**Results**

I won the 85kg division because everyone that I normally compete against in the 85's and 94's are peaking for nationals. Since this is the first meet I lifted at 85 in nearly a year

* gym2 where I can drop the weights (bumpers and platforms...of sorts).

Also, I want a lot of time at low weight under the bar.  So, having said that, I pieced together this routine from various other routines I've found online.   Any thought or opinions would be much appreciated:


Workout A:

* 2x4 High hang snatch at 60% 1rm

* 1x4 snatch at 60% 1rm
* 2x4 high hang C&amp;J at 60% 1rm 
* 2x4 C&amp;J at 60% 1rm
* 3x5 BS

Workout C:

* 1x4 high hang snatch at 85% 1rm
* 1x4 snatch at 85% 1rm
* 1x4 high hang C&amp;J at 85% 1rm
* 1x4 C&amp;J at 85% 1rm

Its difficult because my max is 91kg and I've been failing 65-75kg the past week. Each time its because the pain on my pubic pone is so great that I am physiologically afraid to hit it therefore avoiding aggressive contact and losing power.

A few people have told me that its normal and you will eventually get used to it

I have tried numerous things to fix the issue. No matter how much I actively sweep the bar in and keep it close

Also I have a very wide grip. I'm fairly lankey for my weight and grab the bar less than an inch from the collars.

I've also tried starting with my shoulders more forward over the bar, I began hitting the spot again, and occasionally even when I hit high (waistline) I still feel pain from the contusion a few inches below. 

Not really sure what to do. I feel like a bitch for letting this get in the way of my performance. Has anybody else had this problem? Will it just ""go away"" if I bite the bullet??

My right arm is totally fine. 

I assume it is a pulled muscle. Anyone else ever have this feeling of pain or injury that sounds similar?

**Update** ER doc gave me pain meds and a shot. Said it was a shoulder strain and to follow up with my regular doctor. The xrays didn't reveal anything wrong with the bones. Said it could be a torn or pulled muscle.  MRI would reveal the damage

**Update 2** It's been over a week and the pain has not gone away. This was more that just soreness. Hopefully I can get the MRI scheduled soon. I also have developed a lump just south of my clavicle that is super tender.

4th Meet ever
BW: 91.89

Things started off hectic, so we went from feeling rushed to being anxious pretty quick.

Warm ups for the snatch went well

Snatch 1. 95 - Miss
Power snatched it...and fell over. Video tells me I was way on my right toes as is normal for me

Snatch 2. 98 - Miss
Bar was far out in front
Guys...TUCK DOWN! I smashed my ""unit"" on this lift, and headed out for:

Snatch 3: 98 - Success!
Through the miserable pain, sprinted off the stage to the bathroom.

Clean and jerk warm-ups went well

Clean and Jerk 1: 115 Good
This was simple

Clean and Jerk 2: 121 No lift
Got called for a press out. I felt it

Clean and Jerk 3. 123 No lift
Smashed this for a 2 kg PR. Felt simple

Overall, I mostly wanted to just cry. So I picked up a 500 pound set of tractor tires a couple times, drank a bunch of beers, and feel better now.

From what I can tell I don't go into full triple extension and I'm pulling a bit with my arms. I think that if I think about leaning back more on the pull while keeping my arms straight for as long as possible that should do the trick.

I am about 3-4 months into oly lifting now and I had some pretty bad tendonitis right above my knee for a bit, where I would not be able to gain any momentum from the lift.  It was just violent shrug and drop under like your life depended on it.  This really taught my muscle memory to get under the bar and pull all the way to the hips.  Since then we did a lot of 3/2/1s and eventually reached a point where i'm starting to catch closer to the bottom.  I literally went from a max of 105kg to 124kg in 2 weeks...

Here is my initial 3/2/1 where I got to about a 2 rep of 105kg:

1. Which method

2. Which allows you to lift the most weight/least weight?

To define the terms:

**Hang:** Starting from the bar on the ground, (knee/hip), and the 2nd pull is then engaged.

**Pause:** Starting from the bar on the ground, and the 1st pull is finished, and you go into the 2nd pull and complete the lift.

**Blocks:** The bar starts on blocks, of the 1st pull, and makes one go into the 2nd pull almost from the start, depending on exact block height.

Long story short here I've decided to join a yoga place in december ($40 for the first month unlimited!) and pull back a bit with my training. This is a 'hot yoga' place called moksha (a chain) and I think they practice their own branded form of bikram as well as some hatha yoga (I've just been doing some reading last night, hopefully after a month or so I can return to my 4 or 5/week lifting and throw in yoga a couple times for maintenance.
