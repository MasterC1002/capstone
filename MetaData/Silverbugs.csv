----

So, that is the goal.** I will mail one .999 1 ozt [""blank""](http://i.imgur.com/ljLRSXD.jpg) to each of the winners (or to one person if they win both sides). These were obtained from the Mulligan Mint by /u/GrymmWRX for the purpose of this contest. I'm sure they are out there somewhere from some mint or workers, but I had never even heard of or seen a blank planchet of .999 Ag before I received these. How cool of a prize is that? He donated them out of his pocket and I can't thank him enough. Anyway, I can promise that this will be reposted at least a couple of times throughout the process and 1 weeks notice will be given before the end of the contest. We can put a message on the top of the sub that everyone will see when it loads. So, now for the details we have thus far. (Things may be added or changed, nothing is set in stone other than the prizes, one for each side of the round).

----

Please do not incorporate Snoo (the reddit alien) or ""reddit"" in the design. Apparently they want a large chunk of the gross sales if we do that. Not feasible with a silver round.

This is not for ""dirtiest"" or most ""beat up"" round. We are talking about the design being ugly.

This contest will run for a week. So if you feel the need to shop for an ugly round to win

You must take a photo of the round with your reddit username and date showing in the photo.

You must have an account at least 90 days old.

Now, as long as he doesn't have an issue with it, if you win and don't want a Freedom Girl for whatever reason, I'll attempt to come up with a prize from my stash you like and just keep this round myself. If you are in a foreign country and want the Freedom Girl, I will check on shipping costs and if they are more than US shipping, you can pay the difference for the prize.

Many places had prefabbed silver or gold tubes

I spoke to a funeral home about a custom project

Then I met pheenix - I know many of you would call me crazy

I sent him metals to make 2 bear claws which were my son's favorite animal. He had two favorites - T-rex and bears - one living and one extinct. He made the claws and sealed my son's ashes at the top with .999 copper slug that I sent him. He also cast in .999

He treated my son's ashes with the greatest respect. He made a dream possible for two parents that really couldn't afford the asking price from funeral homes. 

He was so professional and respectful. My son died a year ago - just a small child. He created two pieces that are of relic quality. He did it for such a reasonable price that I am giving him a gem uncirc ase and generic round for a sterling bug just to send money his way. I am also going to send him a crazy gift package in the near future. 

He was so kind, but he still remained professional and you would've never known we even chatted about that stuff.

In the near future

Here is a photo of the completed project -

I worked at Lehman Brothers for many years and was convinced that paper was the way to go.  Then I was laid off

I learned the hard way about diversification and worked hard to rebuild my investments from their shattered remains. I listened to advisors that didn't have anything to gain or lose from my investments doing well or poorly.  

One (very old) advisor in particular looked at my asset mix last year and commented I didn't have any PM holdings.  I went and out and SLV and GLD.  

At our next meeting, then put the printout of my GLD purchase in my other hand.    He then took the eagle and put a $20 bill in my hand.  There I am, holding a $20 bill in one hand and a paper share of GLD in my other,  both feeling empty and weightless compared to the eagle.  I immediately understood and was hooked at that point.  He made sure I understood that paper, fiat and physical each have their strengths and weaknesses, how to put each one to work for me, never get them confused and above all have fun.  He pulled out a silver eagle and handed it to me and said this should get me going.  He died before our next meeting.

Buckle your seatbelts because things are about to change.

My first job as new moderator will be (after cleaning out the spam filters)... electing another moderator.  I know that we are all getting tired of election polls

I am going to come up with a fair way of of conducting a election for the second moderator.  It is likely going to be a poll post, day, and night so we can quickly resolve filtered posts.

After elections are over

One direction I would like to take is a greater focus on contests and events.  This is exciting and something for us all to look forward to.  We will need lots of help here with organizing and fundraising

Please message me if you have any needs

I already sold the one I had on hand to another person so I told him no and that I could get some for him at the LCS.  His response was something along the lines of ""Yes that's great.  Grab me as many as you can""  Went to the LCS and they had several at a decent price so I got 5 of them (first mistake).  I tell him that I picked up the coins and get no response from him for a couple days.  Send him a more assertive email and he is like ""oh yea ive been busy.""  And says to me ""I think I'm only going to take 3"" (then why did you tell me to pick up as many as I could???)  Wait another day for a response and he tries to lowball me by asking for a lesser amount than the original agreed upon amount.  I meet him halfway and give him my address.  Another day passes (we are at about a week now) with no response and I ask him what's going on.  He says ""oh I live in Canada... I can't ship there""  I try to reason with him but responses are at minimum 2 days wait. He now refuses to complete the trade and I am stuck with the coins I got for him.  The saying really does ring true here

Stage a picture of your stack in a way a pirate would stash it

Include your reddit username

Host the picture on imgur.com and post the link in this thread.

Only users that are at least somewhat active on reddit are eligible. Meaning you should have posts somewhere on this massive site (and not just the freebie subs looking for stuff). I just want people that contribute to this awesome community to be the ones that win prizes. This is an insanely huge site

I will take upvotes and comments into consideration

I will pick a winner this Sunday morning when I wake up. That should give everyone plenty of time to think and set up some awesome pics to submit.

***Please upvote this for more visibility. This is a self post and as such I get no karma from it. However

----

So, that is the goal.** I will mail one .999 1 ozt [""blank""](http://i.imgur.com/ljLRSXD.jpg) to each of the winners (or to one person if they win both sides). These were obtained from the Mulligan Mint by /u/GrymmWRX for the purpose of this contest. I'm sure they are out there somewhere from some mint or workers, but I had never even heard of or seen a blank planchet of .999 Ag before I received these. How cool of a prize is that? He donated them out of his pocket and I can't thank him enough. Anyway, I can promise that this will be reposted at least a couple of times throughout the process and 1 weeks notice will be given before the end of the contest. We can put a message on the top of the sub that everyone will see when it loads. So, now for the details we have thus far. (Things may be added or changed, nothing is set in stone other than the prizes, one for each side of the round).

----

Please do not incorporate Snoo (the reddit alien) or ""reddit"" in the design. I have a few emails out asking permission and I'm still awaiting a reply. I don't want to use it and then have a problem down the road for the makers should be go that route.

Please make sure the designs are saved in the file format .ai from Adobe Illustrator. If they are saved with the pdf compatibility option

Multiple submissions from the same users are allowed and encouraged. However

Upvotes will make a difference

Keep in mind that you are giving up any and all rights to your design by submitting it. This means that should yours be chosen

More rules may be added and/or existing ones may be changed. If you have any questions, as soon as we know details, you guys will know details. I have zero ability to keep a secret typically so yea... you'll know when the time has come.  :)

Good luck to everyone and get creative. The only thing that you can't change is the shape. It has to be a circle. Thanks!

Reminder from /u/chuckscoin ~&gt; It's obvious, but you must specify weight, and include .999 somewhere, or else many LCS won't accept them when you decide to turn them in.

Neither of us knows anything about coins, year, mint?? etc... I'm beyond overwhelmed as my husband and I are about to purchase a house, and this would really help with a down payment. My sister and I agreed to split everything right down the middle, after we sell it.

My greatest hesitation is that we're going to get completely screwed. We obviously don't know what we're looking for

We're starting with a bag of dimes, and Mercury dimes. It seems like we have about the same amount of Roosevelts and Mercury dimes, and only a handful of barbers. Should we also be searching and dividing by years? It seems impossible as there are just so many. Should we just take them in and sell all of them at once?

1366428588.0,1cpzif,Understanding a few little fundamentals in the silver market,argoff,37,3,9,"You may have all heard this before

Supply:

On the supply side of the silver market, the price of silver could go up drastically, and many miners would still have no incentive to ramp up production.   Also, even if they did, bringing silver production online takes a few years and tens of millions of dollars, if not billions.   So the supply side of silver is very tight, and will remain that way unless something drastic happens.  (ps this is also probably why jp morgan, decided to get into the copper futures market recently)  

Demand:

On the demand side, the price of silver could increase dramatically, and people will still not cut back usage of it in industry because that cost is a very tiny amount of their overall cost structure.  

Monetary side:

On the monetary side, but in the silver market, the more prices go up, the more it looks like an attractive store of value in relation to gold.   So prices going up in silver will actually cause the supply and demand problems of silver to get worse.  Especially since the gold market is far larger than the silver market.

The big banks:

This is why the big banks must keep the price of silver contained at all costs.  The moment silver starts to look like an attractive alternative to the much larger gold market

How do the banks keep the price of silver down:

Simple, but the effect is still the same.

So why would the banking system want to invest in a way that loses money on silver:

They may lose billions dollars on silver, then the federal reserve will actually have to start restricting the supply of printed up money to contain the panic, and those 1% loans will be gone.

So why does the government let them do this manipulation:

Because as the 1% loans go

So what is going to happen in the silver market:

The government will probably continue to sanction price manipulation, either by shorting, or by forcing money into alternatives that make other investments look more attractive for awhile.   They will keep doing this until something ""breaks"" in a big way, when that happens it should not be surprising to see the price of silver go nuclear and possibly blow the gold price out of the water of which gold will also go up quite a bit because they play a lot of similar games in the gold market for the same reasons as well.  They will probably continue to print up money till the US has an argentina like currency crises, which will probably be the trigger event.

So when is this going to happen:

I don't know.  I never thought the housing bubble could go on as long as it did

PS: also
PSS: I should also mention margin.   A lot of times when silver rises, but wouldn't be surprised if they make money shorting silver.   ",,False,self,t5_2t1b5,1366430171.0,,

So... a few of us here and there have made a flat design out of our stack and some have even made some small teetering actual stacks and posted the pics. This time I want to mix that up a bit and force people to be even more creative.

I want to see a picture of something you BUILD with your stack. Not a flat picture

Make sure the picture has a piece of paper in it that has your reddit username

Make sure your account is somewhat active on reddit, be social and share your knowledge! I have contests every month or so here, so even if you're a lurker now, start being active and chatting a bit and enter the next one.

The winner will ultimately be decided by me

Ok, Seated Liberty, Barber, Mercury and a Roosevelt as seen [here](http://imgur.com/a/bJzL4). Only one other Capped Bust dime card like this is out there to my knowledge so these sets are pretty rare to have complete and will be most likely as I don't have a large supply of inexpensive Capped Bust and Seated Liberty dimes nice enough to make them.

The contest will end Sunday evening at 9PM EST. That is when I will announce the winning ""sculpture of silver"" and get the info on where to ship the prize to.

Thanks a bunch everyone for keeping this place fun and informative and keep up the posting of various pictures and articles. This is the best online community I've found to date and I will continue to support it via being a mod and having contests and giveaways.

Keep on stackin'!

1374532812.0,1iuf50,Attempted scam after silver delivery (sort of),throwawaysilver1,33,10,50,"I recently ordered about 60 pounds of silver bars from a reputable precious metals dealer and had it shipped to my office via UPS. It arrived OK. My secretary signed for it. No problem.

Two days later, so it could be either one of these. He tells my secretary that he is on his way right now to our office to get what’s his and he knows for a fact that she signed for it and again states that he knows her name is xxxxx.

I call the police. They are on their way. I meet the man at the door. Tall white guy late 30’s. Has a 5 year old daughter with him. He shows me a piece of paper. It is a printout of a UPS tracking order. It matches exactly the legitimate one that I got from the silver company that I used to track my order previously. He says he is here to “get to the bottom of things”. Said he ordered something online (either silver or ammo) and according to the company that he ordered from

Anyway, that I had legitimately ordered silver for myself. He lectures me that it’s dangerous and a bad idea to own physical silver and that if I liked silver to just buy some silver certificates. I thank him for the financial advice.

I called the silver dealer to tell them story and they did not know of any such scam. I called UPS. They were very diligent and took all the information and called me back a few hours later to tell me they had no employee with that name and phone #.

I called back the phone # of the suspicious guy, “Why is it that you don’t know exactly the type of silver (or ammo) that you supposedly ordered?”, he just kept deflecting the conversation back to “I have the tracking slip. And I’m just trying to get what’s mine.” Finally he said, now my kid is upset and my wife is upset because my kid is asking if daddy is going to jail. Are you going to keep calling me and bothering me about it? I didn’t do anything wrong. What did I do wrong? I just wanted to get my ammo”. I promised him I wouldn’t call him back without a good reason.

Any thoughts?
– How did he get the tracking info?
– What was he trying to pull? Did he seriously think that my secretary would just hand over the package to him?

EDIT: ImpalaPooge below may have solved the mystery. If so, as we all should be
You guys are awesome!

EDIT: JUL 23 I am working with my silver dealer and UPS to get to the bottom of this. I understand the value to this community to learn the truth from this. I still don't have all the facts, I'll just say it has gotten even more interesting. A reasonable (harmless) explanation has been proposed to me, but there are still some details that don't quite make sense.

CONCLUSION JUL 31: Good ending. According to the silver dealer that I bought from, is their customer. He ordered from them (under a slightly different name?). UPS gave out the wrong tracking number. The first 10 digits are a given match because it is the same shipper, but due some glitch, the tracking # that DC was given spit out MY shipping information. I have since had some friendly conversations with DC and may have lunch with him. I am 95% convinced he is a nice friendly fellow. He is a little absent-minded and has recently ordered product from many different dealers (which could explain why he didn't correctly identify what he was looking for). He is a normal guy other than having a few wacky thoughts about how the government is conspiring to rob people by devaluing the US dollar and how a few corrupt elite are taking away people's freedoms, crazy stuff like that ;)",,False,t5_2t1b5,True

A gallery of various things I've cast in silver. Many are ""first attempts"" just to get an idea what the item would look like. Any of them can be recreated (pun intended) assuming I can find that little rose quartz bar.

Future attempts have improved greatly (except the bear claw and the silverbug which are currently unique) but with any hand cast and hand finished item

The bear claw is 150g and everything else is under 1oz. I'd be willing to recreate anything for a fellow silverbug provided costs are covered (silver and shipping mostly). I'm willing to use your silver or mine. Anything beyond that, but sure as hell won't be refused ;)

note: I tend to round down and understate purity. Let's say I cast a 20.5g item out of a batch that was assayed to 95%. I would call it 20g and .925. The intent is you get more than what you pay for.

If you're interested in any of these items

I also accept silver, bitcoin or paypal.

I'd decided I was going to do Half Dollars, it's a start.

Bank #2 was on my way home so I stopped in

I decide to head home now and begin cracking these rolls. I figured I'd be happy finding about $20 in mixed silver. I fly threw the dimes...nothing. Next up, a 1967 (only 40%, but i'll take it!). Next roll...entirely 40%. Two rolls in and already twenty-one 40%'ers..damn! When all was said and done.....162 40% halves, and 1 90% (a 1950 franklin). Yes..one hundred and sixty two 40% halves out of $500. There were several rolls that were nothing but silver. Others were sporadically mixed. Several BU 1968/1969's. I'm guessing someone found their grandparents stash and just cashed them in at the bank. 

Needless to say I went back to said bank and asked for another $500...absolutely nothing. Not one silver coin. The first $500 was hand rolled

First time doing this..I don't think I should expect the same results as box #1 very often.

It's become obvious that we are at a standstill on our design a round contest.  It seems to me that a major aspect of this is that there are still plenty of unanswered questions and things that are up in the air.  We still don't know what we are allowed to include as far as representing ourselves as a community hosted by reddit.  

We also don't know who will be creating the designs once we are at a point to move forward with our community selected winning designs that we can all agree on represent us the best.

I would argue that, but what if we have a design sweet enough that reputable dealers would be willing to offer them?

I don't have any financial stake at all in this project going forward...other than the blanks I have offered so far as prizes.  I just want to see some designs that capture who we are on silver

I realize that some of you have a distaste for this 'custom round fad'

*****

I'd like to hear your reason for stacking.

The winner of this contest will win [this 1oz Ron Paul round](http://imgur.com/a/alDVK), here's the catch:

You're not allowed to use the word ""Silver.""

And you are limited to only six words.

As far as rules, thought-provoking, or insightful. We'll limit submissions to one entry per person (with accounts &gt;1 month old). This contest is sold by weight, not by volume, and the use of memes is discouraged (for example: bitchez). Entries must be exactly 6 words, not contain the word silver, and form a complete sentence (or two, but each must be complete sentences). Some leeway will be given on that last bit.

The contest will end Monday morning at 3:00 am on July 1st, I'll send them an ASE if they're not that into Ron Paul).

Some examples would be:

""The JPMorgan

""Inflation-proof

""Metals make me merry and mirthful.""",self,t5_2t1b5,1372693569.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Silverbugs/comments/1h4zso/contest_dont_steal_the_government_hates/

Recently, .99+ piece. They are made using .999 fs and cost the same as your traditional - yet boring - Silver Eagle. Yet, you get four pieces. 

We're excited by the feedback and orders since June's launch of the ""Fine Silver Quarters."" We'll be designing the 1 ozt pieces soon and will follow it up with a 1/10 ozt piece. 

You can find out more about us at http://sunsoflibertymint.com . I understand that some in this group have already heard about our ""Quarters."" We thank you for your business. 

If you have any other questions feel free to ask or contact myself via the site.

I currently have no interest in the numismatic side of collecting and am stacking mostly for the metal itself.  I'm drawn to OPM's stuff for the low price over spot

So I guess my question is what do you guys gravitate toward and does the premium of branded bullion also (hopefully) appreciate or is a $2.50 premium spent now going to (likely) sell for the same $2.50 in 20 years?
