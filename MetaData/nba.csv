I activated my reddit account just a moment ago and because I've been seeing the videos of Kobe's most recent dunks and the comments you guys have had to share I decided I might as well chime in what I know about the man. And let me just state by saying that this story doesn't touch on anything we don't know about Kobe but rather that he simply is not human when he is working on his craft.

I was invited to Las Vegas this past Summer to help Team USA with their conditioning before they head off to London, early July. It was a brief conversation where we talked about conditioning, where he would like to be by the end of the Summer, and we talked a little bit about the hustle of the Select Team. Then he got my number and I let him know that if he ever wanted some extra training he could hit me up any time. 

The night before the first scrimmage I remember I was just watched ""Casablanca"" for the first time and it was about 3:30 AM. I lay in bed

""Hey

""Uhh no

""Just wondering if you could just help me out with some conditioning work

I checked my clock. 4:15 AM. 

""Yeah sure

It took me about twenty minutes to get my gear and out of the hotel. When I arrived and opened the room to the main practice floor I saw Kobe. Alone. He was drenched in sweat as if he had just taken a swim. It wasn't even 5AM. 

We did some conditioning work for the next hour and fifteen minutes. Then we entered the weight room

I was expected to be at the floor again at about 11 AM. I woke up feeling sleepy, Kobe. I had a bagel and headed to the practice facility. 

This next part I remember very vividly. All the Team USA players were there, ""Good work this morning.""

""Huh?""

""Like

""Oh. Yeah

""So when did you finish?""

""Finish what?""

""Getting your shots up. What time did you leave the facility?""

""Oh just now. I wanted 800 makes so yeah

My jaw dropped. Mother of holy God. It was then that I realized that there's no surprise to why he's been as effective as he was last season. Every story about his dedication

Thanks for reading and allowing me to share you my Kobe Bryant story. If anyone has any questions I can clarify. Sorry if the story was at all hard to follow as this is my first time on reddit.

Rob.

But if you though Kobe was riding your ass

Dwight, and then better than us again over the last decade. You can literally be the GM and build-a-team like some 2k shit.

No one will talk shit about you. There is literally no pressure. People are too burnt out after Packer season to give a shit about this franchise. Aaron Rodgers and Ryan Braun will be recognized on the street more than you will. People will ask you if you are a new linebacker for the Packers and you'll respond ""No

How the fuck could you not want to play inside of [this fucking thing?] (http://media.jrn.com/images/mjs-bradley_-nws_-lynn_-1\(2\).jpg). It looks like the fucking architect realized last minute there were no fucking windows in his original design

Think about your stats. I can see you averaging 35 and 15. You will be the first ever **MOST VALUABLE IMPROVED PLAYER COACH AND DEFENDER OF THE YEAR AWARD** winner. Fuck

This is exactly what you want. Build your own team, max deals until you die, no trade clauses, player options. Amnesty yourself if you get bored, no one will even know you were here.

Best Case Scenario: Build your own championship team

Worst Case Scenario: You win **MVIPCDOTY** award(s) and amnesty yourself when you get bored and do this whole free agency thing some other year

Didn't receive much attention and everyone was making fun of the OP.

However, and, to be honest, he seems bored and has too much free time not being able to travel with the team so why the hell not to try to get him to do an AMA?

As the first request said it - he seems pretty comfortable writing and interacting with fans; in the meantime

I believe he is one of the most intriguing people in the NBA, he's Kobe.

If he does agree to do the AMA

* How has your partially European upbringing contributed to your development

* What's your take on the Grantland article on your hip hop career? Could you answer this in rhymes?

* Are you aware of all the .gif-s of you on the interwebs? If so

* Eddie Jones, Mitch Richmond. What was your relationship with them? Did you learn anything from them?

* Did the facelift of the Lakers uniforms in 1999 have an additional psychological effect on you guys?

So yea. Hope this works well.

**EDIT ON FURTHER STEPS**: Judging by the support, and I guess mass tweeting to him might get him to pay attention. Any other ideas are welcome. Also, not sure if x-posting to r/lakers or r/IamA is a good idea? Hope to get valuable feedback in the comments.

**A BRILLIANT [IDEA](http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1cv1yk/iama_request_kobe_bryant/c9kfm9x)** by /u/omar12:

&gt;How hard would it be to send a ""get better soon"" basket to him on behalf of the reddit community? If this is possible

* It is well-documented that Tim Duncan is one of the bigger nerds in the NBA.

&gt;Tim Duncan is the NBA's first superstar nerd. I find it very interesting that Tim Duncan's off the court pursuits include sword and knife collecting, dude's got a freakin' tattoo of Merlin from Arthurian lore! His other tat is of a Skeleton Jester. No barbed wire or homages to dead relatives here. Just pure (and endearing) D&amp;D nerdcore.

* He also wears a [Punisher Knee Brace](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/928712/Tim-Duncan-Punisher_medium.jpg)

* There has been a recent influx of funny Tim Duncan actions throughout the playoffs

* If Manu did an AMA

* If I can spend around 10-15 minutes a day on /r/nba it's really not that farfetched for NBA players to be browsing a little reddit in their free time. A bunch of them are on Twitter and Instagram.

and my last point...

* It just seems like a Tim Duncan thing to do, knowing that people have no idea who just commented.",,False,,t5_2qo4s,1371542501.0,Warriors1,

**After that**

**2006, their second in 5. During this time, the team is essentially Kobe Bryant (A top-5 player) and garbage.

**2009, their second in 5. During this time, the team is essentially Dwayne Wade (A top-5 player) and garbage.

I've been working on this on-and-off for years as a hobby. It's only recently gotten to the point where it's fairly complete. The general idea is that you act as the GM for a basketball team. You draft players, and adjust the roster to try to build a dynasty. But if you lose too many games or spend too much money, you might get fired.

If you're a programmer, design (both UI and gameplay), testing, and feedback are all needed.

1376450756.0,1kbqlg,Update: My Lakers fan father has passed away (and the Lakers came through),dogsdieinhotcars,2168,672,219,"r/NBA:

Last week I posted this thread giving details of my father that had been in a serious car accident: http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1k3itw/my_father_was_paralyzed_on_monday_nighti_need/

I'm sad to say that today

First of all

Don't ask me why

Enough sadness!  Let's get to the happy stuff!

A number of you helped me get in touch with some NBA personalities and a few of them came through in a very short amount of time:

1.  Mark Cuban - u/rgluna gave me Mr. Cuban's personal email address and Mark sent me a direct email wishing my family the best.  A small gesture that shows what kind of character he has.

2.  Glenn Beck - u/eldertheelder put me in touch with a member of Mr. Beck's production team.  I've been told to expect a few signed items in the mail and we're excited to get them.

3.  The Lakers - u/horrificmedium came through huge and reached out to Linda Rambis (wife of former lakers player and current assistant coach Kurt Rambis).  Linda shipped out a whole box of Lakers gear to lift my dad's spirits.  This included: A regulation ball signed by the team, a Laker's blanket, Kareem and Chick Hearn bobbleheads (!), and a few other items.

Check the package out here: http://imgur.com/a/qWXLu#0

While my Dad wasn't able to enjoy the gear for long

Thank you to Reddit and to the Lakers for helping give my father a little bit of joy and peace during his final moments.  This helped put a smile on all 6 of his children's faces and my mother's face.  

TL;DR - Kurt Rambis is the best big man in NBA history.",,t5_2qo4s,False,,Lakers1,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1kbqlg/update_my_lakers_fan_father_has_passed_away_and/

Edit: (Thanks to /u/swollencornholio) A good way to figure out the time frame if you forgot when it was is ESPN's play-by-play. They give you down to the gametime second of shots, steals, and assists.
The fastest way to get to the play by play that I found is google ""your team's name"" +""espn"" the first hit should bring you to your team page on espn.go.com 

Edit2: (Thanks to /u/Mrjoehobo) There is also a play by play on nba.com game story/box score that is linked in the gamethread description.

1374022141.0,1igbmp,"Explaining the Celtics/Nets Trade in 1,000 Easy Steps; or, How the Celtics Just Became 2014 Free Agency Players",dangercart,1551,319

The Celtics/Nets trade may be one of the most complicated in NBA history but is also a really good study in how a smart front office can use the CBA to their advantage. Everyone focused on the draft picks in this trade but it turns out that the way the Celtics have positioned themselves for next year's free agent class might be just as important. Here's a break-down of what exactly happened in this trade. How did the Celtics end up with a big trade exception? Why did D.J. White appear in the trade at the last minute? Read on to find out...

**Important Concepts**

* The NBA doesn't always consider a trade to be a single transaction. Trades can be [simultaneous](http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm#Q82) or [non-simultaneous](http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm#Q83)

* When a [team trades a minimum salary player](http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm#Q84)

* A free agent who made under $1.2M in the prior season that is included in a trade as a sign-and-trade player only counts half of their salary when trying to reach a salary match. This is known as a [base year compensation](http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm#Q87) player.

* [Trade kickers](http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm#Q97) have to be salary matched by teams accepting the player but the kicker does not count for the team trading the player away.

* Teams under the luxury tax have different trade rules than taxpaying teams and the rules are dependent on the size of the trade.

**What Went Down**

The Celtics and Nets decided they wanted to make a trade built around Pierce and KG. The Celtics made the Nets agree to take on Jason Terry's contract but the Nets really only had a few players they could include from their end. The problem was that the Nets are above the cap so they can only take in contracts equaling **125% + $100

Nets Get|Salary|
:--|--:|
Paul Pierce|$15
Kevin Garnett|$12
Jason Terry (w/ trade kicker)|$5
**Total**|**$33

To match this,906** in salaries because the Nets are over ([way, way over](http://www.reddit.com/r/capology/comments/1i31e9/the_nets_roster_is_crazy_expensive/)) the luxury tax. However, all the Nets had that the C's were willing to take was:

Celtics Get|Salary
:--|--:|
Kris Humphries|$12
Gerald Wallace|$10
MarShon Brooks|$1
Kris Joseph|$788
**Total**|**$24

The Nets were **$2, they had the rights to one Keith Bogans. Bogans only made the veteran's minimum last year which means if he were included in a sign-and-trade his contract would only count for half in the trade. This is to keep teams from gaming the system because it's expensive. The Celtics apparently didn't care because they just signed Bogans to twice the amount the Nets were short: **$5,058,198**. This made the trade valid from the Nets perspective, and that's all that really mattered.

Nets Get|Salary|Celtics Get|Salary
:--|--:|:--|--:|
Paul Pierce|$15,529,099
Kevin Garnett|$12,000,000
Jason Terry|$5,105,855
  |  |MarShon Brooks|$1
  |  |Kris Joseph|$788
**Total**|**$33,633,906**

-----------------------

Now that the trade was valid, the C's went to work.

First

Nets Get|Salary|Celtics Get|Salary|
:--|--:|:--|--:|
  |  |Kris Joseph|$788
**TOTAL**|**$0**|**TOTAL**|**$788

Next

Originally

Nets Get|Salary|Celtics Get|Salary|
:--|--:|:--|--:|
Paul Pierce|$15,000,000
Jason Terry (w/o trade kicker)|$5,105,855
  |  |MarShon Brooks|$1
**TOTAL**|**$20,315,935**

This would have worked fine,000,000** more what they're sending out and with KG's smaller salary they didn't quite make it because $12,433,735 + $5225000 +$5,000,000 = **$22,735** which is less than the salaries of Humphries

Enter D.J. White. White has a league minimum, so instead they added him to Garnett and Terry to get over the salaries of Humphries, Wallace and Brooks. This only works because the Celtics are currently under the luxury tax. If they were over they could only accept 125% + $100,000 of outgoing salaries and they would have been **$37,100 short**. Instead, a trade of under $19.6M for a non-tax paying team is a match if the teams are within $5M, which they now just barely were.

Nets Get|Salary|Celtics Get|Salary|
:--|--:|:--|--:|
Kevin Garnett|$12,000,000
Jason Terry	|$5,105,855
DJ White|$884,080
**TOTAL**|**$18,315,935**

The teams were then left with Pierce and Bogans. The Celtics can make the trade because, they receive a trade exception for the difference.

Nets Get|Salary|Celtics Get|Salary|
:--|--:|:--|--:|
Paul Pierce|$15,058,198
  |  |Trade Exception|**$10
**TOTAL**|**$15,333,334**

**So? What Does That Do?**

This trade exception expires on 7/12/14. The signing moratorium ends on 7/10/14. Keith Bogans' contract is completely non-guaranteed for 2014-15. This means that, or a sign-and-trade, for over $10M without sending any guaranteed contracts back plus they have Bogans' ""super expiring"" for over $5M more.** They could throw in some of their many draft picks to entice a team to agree to a sign-and-trade if they get a free agent to agree to sign in Boston. They could take someone else's expiring contract. They could help someone get below the luxury tax. They only have a few days to work with, but the Celtics not only picked up three draft picks (and the right to swap another) to build the future, they also made themselves real players in next year's free agent super class, if they want to be one.h",,,Celtics1,

1362803058.0,19yf6h,My incredibly deranged prediction for this season,fatasslarry7,1570,451,270,"Here's my prediction for the remainder of the season:

The Lakers finally start playing inspired basketball with Dwight Howard becoming a fan favorite by playing “Shaq-like” basketball. In an unbelievable turn of events

Fast forward to the Finals, when we hear Jim Ross with this historic call: ""Howard with the rebound and this should lock up the champineship for the Lakers... GOOD GAWD ALMIGHTY! WITH GOD AS MA WITNESS, DWIGHT HOWARD JUST SLAM DUNKED THE BALL IN HIS OWN HOOP! WHAT THE HELL IS GOIN' ON HERE? WAIT A MINUTE! LEBRON AND HOWARD ARE SHAKING HANDS!"" Jerry Lawler, who had previously despised Dwight Howard for being liked, suddenly turns into D12's biggest fan. 

Dwight removes his Lakers jersey to reveal a Heat jersey, the good guy act to win the fans back during the Lakers' playoff run. Dawning the black and red, Howard grabs the mic and cements himself as a heel when he says, ""All you stinking fans in this DUMP of a city can all KISS-MY-ASS!"" Expectedly, the crowd boos at the notion of their city being called a dump.

The Heat bench clears as they start decimating the Lakers with steel folding chairs. Immediately, who has reverted to his Ron Artest persona, adds to the chaos by going into the stands and punching the first fan he comes across. Having seen enough, Shaquille O’Neal runs down to the court and starts fighting side by side with Kobe, as an emotionally charged arena cheers their every punch. Unfortunately, the Heat proves to be too much for the three-time championship duo. Kobe fights off a few Heat players, and tries to reason with Howard, ""Queen Bryant"" on his chest.

When all hope seems lost, breaks a basket with a dunk, causing glass to shatter and Steve Austin’s theme song to start playing. Michael Jordan appears, driving a Coors Light truck with Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Steve Kerr, and Horace Grant standing on top. MJ gets out of the truck, grabs the mic from a frightened Howard and screams

The crowd erupts as the Bulls begin attacking the Heat players. Pippen starts punching LeBron and Wade, and delivers a People’s Elbow, running from one side of the court to the other, covering a distance of approximately 188 feet. 

On the sidelines, Lakers, and '93 Bulls is the only way to determine the true 2013 NBA champions.

During the overtime, Jack Nicholson. As Nicholson celebrates, Dwight Howard grabs him and readies him for a tombstone pile driver, but is met with a swift kick below the belt by Jeff Van Gundy. In a bizarre turn of events, every single player from each team is eliminated from the game through a series of foul-outs, low blows from Laker Girls, and being thrown over the newly installed top rope at courtside. Almost too surreal to believe, LeBron James

With one minute remaining, causing good ol’ J.R. to remark: “GOOD GOD ALMIGHTY! MAMA BRYANT’S BABY BOY IS BROKEN IN HALF! HE MUSTA BEEN A GOOD TEN…. TWENTY FEET IN THE AIR!” Having witnessed the carnage, the Laker crowd – even the celebrities who are usually reserved but are now more animated than a junkie on Skid Row – start chanting “HOLY SHIT! HOLY SHIT!” During a subsequent replay, Jim Ross claims, “And here’s another shot of that last series of events, folks. Kobe musta been a good… forty feet in the air when Jordan hit him with that foreign object.”

Exhausted from a combination of being fifty years old, Jordan falls down at the three point line, perfectly perpendicular to the basket. Atop of the scoreboard is LeBron James, who launches a beautiful Five Star Frog Splash on Jordan. While he goes to cover Jordan, David Stern runs down to ringside. LBJ drapes an arm over Jordan and on the count of two, Stern orders the ref to “RING THE BELL GODDAMIT!” even though MJ kicked out. Ultimately, this gives LeBron James and the Miami Heat a very controversial NBA Championship

**TL;DR** I predict that the Miami Heat will win the 2013 NBA Championship.",,t5_2qo4s,1373522031.0,,Supersonics2,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/19yf6h/my_incredibly_deranged_prediction_for_this_season/

Anyways, to save you guys from reading alot, he essentially came to my school and performed and let me go on stage with him. Needless to say, I became very popular. His manager thanked me through text for allowing Ron this opportunity. I kept in contact with him and his manager through text, and he has provided me with Laker tickets twice (btw I hate the Lakers, Rockets fan here). I sometimes text him and his manager and they have responded most of the time. He updates me with his new # each time (he goes through like several different numbers a year, and barely realized this connection. I can possibly text him and his manager to do an AMA

Edit: I sound like I'm showing off with the long story lol

Edit 2: Ok guys, I wasn't doing this for karma (self posts dont get karma) or trying to impress people I don't even know. I really did want to get a general feel for Ron's (Yes I call him Ron, and so does his manager) popularity. I wasn't sure if people absolutely hated him, thought he was a douche, wanted to cuss him out, etc.... I didn't want it to be a disaster for him and waste his and his manager's time. It seems most people love Metta. Anyways, I'll update when there are updates.

So what do people mean when they say that the league was watered down for Jordan?

I'm going to do my best to explain and to give you guys a better idea by making modern day equivalencies. They won't be perfect

------------------------------------------------
**EXPANSION:**

When Jordan's Bulls really started to take off it directly coincided with a period of expansion.

In 1988 the NBA added 2 expansion teams (Heat and Hornets). In 1989 they added another 2 expansion teams (Timberwolves and Magic).

Imagine if the NBA decided to add 2 new teams before the start of this season. That would be 2 new teams, while hurting any franchise players the expansion teams selected by putting them in truly horrible situations.

There would also be an expansion draft

How would this benefit a team like the Heat

Well, and seeing as their role players are all comprised of veterans, there is very little chance any of their players get drafted in an expansion draft. An expansion team building for the future isn't going to want to select 38 year old Ray Allen, for example, even though he is a key cog for the Heat.

More likely than not

Now imagine that after there was an expansion draft this off-season, and again, Miami would remain untouched.

So not only are the Heat remaining the same, and talent league wide is getting further diluted. 

This is basically what happened for Jordan's Bulls.

There was also another expansion draft in 1995, they beat the Bulls that year).

------------------------------------------------------------

**LUCK:**

Now

Also imagine the league's best point guard suddenly retired after an injury he could have come back from, CP3).

Also imagine if a 35 year old legend on a formerly great team's career fell apart due to injuries (Larry

Now

Also imagine if the best potential defender of LeBron died in a car accident (Reggie Lewis

So basically, Kevin Durant, Derrick Rose, Kobe Bryant, Chris Paul, and Paul George are all out of the league. Combine that with 4 expansion teams in 2 seasons (soon to be 6 in a few more years, right as LeBron is hitting the downside of his prime), while also watering down talent league wide

----------------------------------------

**CONCLUSION:**

I think Jordan was GOAT

In a lot of ways he fell into the absolute perfect position. Granted, making his path to the finals somewhat easier (particularly during the 2nd 3-peat), there were still a couple of really good teams he inevitably had to beat, and he beat them all. 

Still, and if so many draft picks and role players weren't robbed from decent teams to fill up expansion squads, things might have been different.",,False,,t5_2qo4s,,http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1k51e1/what_people_mean_when_they_say_the_league_was/

Game 2? The Heat are back

Time to own up peeps

The board and the media are talking like the Heat are dead. Guess what? THE HEAT STILL HAVE HOME COURT ADVANTAGE. In a 2-3-2 they are exactly where they should be and if you asked any Heat fan if they would take 2 games at home to win the title they'd take it.

But isn't that the best part? The uncertainty of every game has been what made this series so riveting (even if the 4th quarter of individual games haven't been). Stop acting like you know what it is going to happen next, this is a great series between 2 very evenly matched teams, 5 or 6 HOFers and 2 coaches that don't make dumb mistakes. You know who wins? Whoever is hottest in the last game.

TL;DR: YOU DON'T KNOW SHIT. I DON'T KNOW SHIT. ESPN DON'T KNOW SHIT. AND BOY IS IT FUN. ",,t5_2qo4s,False,,Rockets2,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1gj31v/lets_just_admit_it_nobody_knows_what_the_hell_is/

My last model had some serious flaws in the code so here are the major improvements:

Win Shares for next season are calculated as the sum of the averages of win shares per 48 of the last three seasons plus the sum of the averages of net changes to win shares per 48 for each player. 2013 minutes are then estimated and multiplied by each player’s win shares per 48 projected. This so called “pie” value is then divided by the total “pie” for the entire NBA to get the fraction of total wins allocated in the NBA each year that player is responsible for. 

Rookie projected win shares are now all based on the NBA comparison players listed on nbadraft.net.

Improvements after the rookie season are scaled back but still remain optimistic for all players as no rookie gets worse. For this reason, and Charlotte can become with one more year of experience. Then again, it still thinks Ben Gordon is the only shooting guard currently signed on Charlotte’s roster. 

- Injured players still come back at 85% of their previous season’s WS/48

- Rosters used were based on [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1i63rl/201314_nba_rosters_so_far/) post so teams like Milwaukee and Atlanta literally don’t have a legitimate point guard

Eastern Conference

Miami 58.94-23.06 (The champs still project as the best team in basketball)

Indiana 52.09-29.91 (A strong offseason for Indy and the return of Granger make them a stronger team than last year)

Chicago 49.89-32.11 (Even with Rose at 85%

Brooklyn 47.28-34.72 (Going to be a super dangerous team to face in the playoffs even if they don’t have the best regular season record especially because their better players will start playing more minutes. The model assumed they will keep Pierce and Garnett fresh for the playoffs by distributing minutes like San Antonio)

New York 43.66-38.34 (Win shares is not a big fan of the Bargnani trade and the lack of minutes for Stat and the retirement of Jason Kidd with no real replacement. God could they use Metta real bad for some serious replacement effect)

Atlanta 38.22-43.78 (Wow

Toronto 37.42-44.58 (I want to say don’t sleep on Toronto

Detroit 36.55-45.45 (Hey look

Cleveland 36.11-45.89 (At least Kyrie goes off to the tune of 7.2 wins produced but they just haven’t addressed the gaping hole at small forward)

 Milwaukee 35.39-46.61 (Bucks nation is waiting with baited breath on the Teague offer and the chance to compete for the 8 seed)

 Washington 33.21-48.79 (Eric Maynor is not a win producer and the front court is really below average. The back court looks nice for the future though.) 

 Boston 32.13-49.87 (Jeff Green is the best player on this team but they really lack a bonified team cancer to get them in the league of the teams truly bottoming out)

 Philadelphia 28.42-53.58 (We all know Philly is trying to be bad and guess what

 Orlando 28.33-53.67 (The youth gets a year better but the Orlando Magic starting lineup couldn’t even win their own summer league)

 Charlotte 26.43-55.57 (Even with the Big Al signing

Western Conference

San Antonio 57.75-24.25 (Would you imagine that

LA Clippers 56.28-25.72 (Bringing in Redick and Dudley while retaining Barnes makes this Clippers team deadly next year. Still could use some front court depth) 

Oklahoma City 53.17-28.83 (OKC just keeps losing contributors but the core is still enough for a top three seed)

Memphis 52.36-29.64 (That Koufos deal was sneaky good for Memphis. Also

Houston 50.43-31.57 (Adding Dwight makes them a 50 win team and contender in the West)

Denver 48.10-33.90 (This offseason has been terrible but if there’s any team with the depth to absorb the losses

Dallas 46.11-35.89 (Dallas is starting to look really good on paper but between Caldo, I’m not sure who’s going to be stopping the other team from scoring. A real center would be nice though the bench mob had good WS/48 so they probably project better than they actually are.)

Golden State 39.06-42.94 (Jack and Landry were actually really important)

Portland 37.94-44.06 (Hey

Utah 37.82-44.18 (If the young guys can keep their old efficiency with heavier minutes

Minnesota 37.80-44.20 (Minnesota should be good but the West is just brutal. They’d still make the playoffs in the East)

 LA Lakers 35.46-46.54 (Kobe will not take less money and he will not let this team be at the front of the lottery)

 New Orleans 34.32-47.68 (There sure is a lot of hype for a team that just lost a decent center and brought in a 2nd tier star who they will play out of position.)

 Sacramento 31.12-50.88 (Luc Mbah a Moute does not mean that your small forward woes are over)

 Phoenix 28.19-53.81 (Bottoming out

**Current Era Recap**

*The Mavericks are a franchise that has been spoiled by success over the course of the recent decade. The franchise was founded in 1980 by Don Carter. The Mavericks three eras can be most aptly defined as follows: a period of semi-relevance and dark-horse playoff contention from 1983-1990 (the highlight of which was Dallas taking the ""Showtime"" Lakers to seven games in the Western Conference Finals in the 1987-88 season), the Mavericks have qualified for the playoffs in every season but one (which was last year). The three head coaches during this time period were Don Nelson (no defense), Avery Johnson (too much defense), and Rick Carlisle (just right).*

**2012-2013 Season Recap**

[2012-2013 Starting Lineup - skip to 2:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcChDBNKSAo)

* This was a particularly painful season for Mavs fans for a couple of reasons; chief among them being injuries to crucial players. By now everyone is probably familiar with the knee issues Dirk had last year to start the season (he missed the first 27 games due to arthroscopic surgery and recovery).

* As always

* This problem was exacerbated by the fact that Dirk was surrounded by an entirely new group of players and playstyles that he was forced to adjust to on the fly. Dirk is one of the smartest and most savvy players in the league, Clippers, Hawks, Rockets(2x), Nets, Warriors and Grizzlies during the aforementioned span).

* Marion also missed 15 games including a brutal stretch of eight games down the home stretch in mid-March when we were still clawing for that 8th seed.

* Of course, it was of little comfort to a franchise accustomed to success.

* Although Dirk has labored (and triumphed, and the front office was unwilling to pay nine figures in luxury taxes (unlike Brooklyn), the team was almost entirely composed of players signed to 1-year deals (Collison, Brand, Kaman) or 2-year deals with player options for the second year (Mayo).

Ah, and see glory brought to this house once again. ~~Batiatus!~~ Let's go Mavs!

**2013-2014**

There's been a TON of activity on this front for the Mavericks - it's been a busy offseason to say the least. But let's start with the draft.

Dallas had the 13th pick in this year's NBA Draft.  They pulled off a trade with the Celtics to move down to 16 and then a subsequent trade with the Hawks to move down to 18. They also acquired Milwaukee’s 43rd pick via trade with Atlanta. Here’s who they got.

Shane Larkin | PG | University of Miami
|:--- | :---: | :---: |

Larkin was the Co-ACC Conference Player of the Year. He also won the Lute Olson Award in addition to being an AP Second Team All-American. Unfortunately

Chad Ford's Take: *The Mavs were looking for a point guard with Darren Collison heading into free agency. Larkin is small, he would've gone much higher. He's a solid pick here for the Mavs.*

The second pick of the draft for the Mavs was:

Ricky Ledo | SG | Providence
|:--- | :---: | :---: |

Ledo was initially taken by the Milwaukee Bucks with the 43rd pick. This pick was traded to the Hawks

Chad Ford's Take: *Ledo has top-10 talent. He's a scoring machine who can really shoot the ball. He slipped after missing the season because the NCAA declared him academically ineligible in addition to numerous off-court issues. If the [Mavs] can rehabilitate him

In the past

I had never shown this before

  It was 3 days before my 20th birthday. What better a gift than a Pistons game that was bound to be a tug of war rematch of the previous year's titanic Eastern Conference Finals. Myself, in section 115, row CC. Three rows behind the Detroit bench. It was heaven (In a twist of fate, I've sat in that exact row now 4 times since then..). The game itself was a slight disappointment, for a victory wouldve been an excellent early present. I remember Rasheed and Darvin Ham had a particular great game. I despised the Pacers, but respected them utmost. Hell, I was and to this day an enormous Artest/World Peace fan. I think he would've made one hell of a Piston in fact. 
      
  Fast forward to the moments after The Shove. The Detroit bench was surprisingly hostile, considering I always thought of him as a gentle giant. Anyways, Artest starts to calm down and decides to lay upon the scorers table, about 25 feet from myself and my company. Both benches are standing and shouting at one another. It was getting pretty damn grim. My girlfriend and I were panning the audience, the little that had remained, and everyone's look was that of worry and clairvoyance, as if we all knew that things were going to come to a head. As I was looking to the left of me, I witness very obviously a man in blue Pistons garb throw his drink toward the court.(This man has since been identified as John Green). The timing, who was doing the local TV play by play, with no one as much thinking to jump upon it. At one time
     
   Fast forward to about 4 minutes after the players had left for the locker rooms. Mason, I would be pepper sprayed or some sort of force would be taken upon me. So, being the kind hearted gentleman I am, I asked my girlfriend to lunge for it. She obliged immediately, and simply walked down to the court and picked it up.

* Said that the only way the Spurs can win against the Grizz is if they score more than 30 points a quarter.

* If the Grizz want to win

That's just during Spurs games. I'm sure there's other idiotic things he's said during other games as well. As long as I'm ranting, pulling stats and information out of his ass. I hate Jalen Rose's voice; I know that's a shitty reason to him but whatever. And Simmons. I like Simmons when he writes. He clearly has knowledge of the game, but I never see that. And the thing is he respects Jalen and Magic too much too call them out on any of their bullshit. Magic can say whatever the fuck he wants cause he's the greatest PG to ever play. And Jalen and Bill are friends from Grantland, so there's never any arguing between them.

And that's exactly what they need. Arguing. TNT works because Kenny, but aren't afraid to call each other out or disagree with one another. And of course no one's better than Ernie.

1371454812.0,1gi5gg,Why the Miami Heat are in serious trouble (long read),celtic92034543,922,213,517,"We’ve all seen the see-saw back and forth from this Heat team throughout the playoffs, for the first time all season


Miami has yet to, which has been great, let’s just talk about the SA offense. My god is it on another level.  Entering the finals, there had only been one time the entire postseason where someone broke 100 on Miami and that was in an overtime game by Indiana. The Spurs have already done it 3 times, twice for over 110. Popovich is fully aware now that their defense is going to be there, and now it’s time to blitz Miami’s defense with their offensive execution. Even with the 18 turnovers tonight, SA forced Miami to keep up to **THEIR** scoring pace just to compete. Spo has been forced to play Miller and Allen extended minutes just to keep up with SA’s offense because, or really any line up Miami threw out, found themselves on the other end of it tonight.


Miami now faces the same problem that ultimately became Memphis’ undoing: choosing between offense and defense on the wings. Because Chalmers and Battier have been unable to space the floor properly for Wade and Lebron, where Danny Green has been lighting them up.  First off, as we all agree, the man is absolutely on fire. It’s literally gotten to the point that we are a little surprised when he misses, ala Steph Curry. Green has been very adept at finding the open space anytime the defense has their attention elsewhere (Parker iso, Duncan iso, Parker/Duncan PnR, blowing up passing lanes and disrupting the SA offense, but perhaps that needs to be reconsidered giving how SA is shooting the 3s. Miami got away with it in game 4 simply because Wade was otherworldly as a “free safety” by generating 6 steals. But for the majority of the series, and Wade stops roaming


The starting lineup that SA threw out tonight is likely going to be the same 5 that starts out in game 6. If that’s the case
Furthermore, simple can’t against this SA offense. The shooters move too well off the ball and Parker and Manu are too good at finding them for Miami to cover them in time. Add in the Heat’s attention to Duncan, and there’s just no way for the Heat to take away all of SA’s options. 


All season long the Heat have forced opponents to play small, The 3 headed monster of Green-Leonard-Ginoboli on the wing has matched up against the Lebron and Wade duel. Adding in the shooting of Neal and passing of Diaw off the bench, and SA’s offense doesn’t miss a beat at any second of the game. There is no time for the Heat to take possessions “off” from defense against this particular SA team.  


Miami survived game 4 from a combined superhuman effort from Lebron, of course they COULD do it again. Is it likely, that the Heat get that top of production on both ends from ALL 3? Hell, are the Heat even going to get a double digit rebounding game from Bosh again this series? And to be completely honest, even if Miami’s big 3 shows up to 90% of what they did in game 4, can they even beat tonight’s SA team? Miami stepped up to a new level this season because of the leap from their role players. Where are those guys now? Battier’s shot has almost completely abandoned him this series to the point that he’s contemplating retirement. Norris Cole was abused so hard by Tony and Manu that Spo played him only 7 minutes. Mario “the GOAT” Chalmers has shot 31% this series. The Birdman must’ve been stuck in the bird cage because he didn’t play a single second in game 5. 


What was once a team challenging the title of “greatest team of all time” and “fo fo fo fo” has now been reduced to one loss from elimination. What was once the promise of “not one, who finally broke out of being the butt of all jokes to have a regular season for the ages, is one loss from a tarnish on his legacy that can never be recovered. Miami has 48 hours to figure out to how to stop the best offensive team that it has encountered in the last 3 years. Whatever happens, I can’t wait for game 6. And this is coming from a fan not rooting particularly for any side. 


**EDIT**


It’s nice to see the discussion here as we all eagerly anticipate for game 6. I just want to add that by no means am I saying SA has this thing locked up



Consider the following.  Everyone


Game 1: SA won’t have another 4 turnover game

Game 3: SA won’t have another 16 3 point game

Game 5: SA won’t shoot 60% from the field

While all of this is true, 10 3 pointer game really out of question for SA?  Will Miami's offense be good enough as well to combat a game like this from SA?

First of all

Second, and that a change of scenery would fix everything. 

Even through all of the Dwightmare, game changing player, I'll admit, but still, with every passing day of the Dwightmare you could see more trouble in the water with this guy.

So the Lakers ended up with him. We heard it all:  ""more championships, I've done that enough until the next time they lose. This is about Dwight.

Bringing score sheets around the locker room and media like some twisted show and tell type shit? Really my nigga? You only got how many shots? How about Pau, Linus Caldwell might as well be your opponent the way you get stripped, and you can't shoot free throws!! I wouldnt give you the damn ball either!!!

Talking bout ""Let's stay together guys, but at least Bynum could score and doesn't look like a big ass whale out of water doing post moves to the basket.

You pushed a coach to his limits and ultimately got him fired because he felt he didnt deserve to put up with your Bullshit. Now you're one of the main reasons a historic franchise is being destroyed from the inside out.

You got a free throw at two different franchises and went 0 for 2 on both chances. But hey

I'll be here awhile. I'm recording some video with Coach Nick's bballbreakdown YouTube channel later today. You'll get to watch that this week too.

Let's talk about prospects and the Draft!

AMAA!

EDIT2: I guess I lied. After ten minutes

EDIT3: It's almost 9 PM Eastern. I went through the whole thread and I think I answered every question. I'll keep responding to any questions that pop up.

I recorded some video with Coach Nick of bballbreakdown a little while ago
