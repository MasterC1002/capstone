After President Obama’s historic campaign stop on Reddit

Now there’s a study that backs up that assertion.

On March 12, revealed a series of graphs that documented the history of the Internet's self-proclaimed front page.

The graphs detailed the rise—and decline—of the site’s many nooks and crannies as proven by user submissions. By 2009, managed to eclipse the content posted to r/reddit.com, the site's longtime miscellany subreddit. In 2011, r/reddit.com was permanently closed.

These days, r/askreddit, and r/pics. With the exception of r/askreddit, the top subreddits are driven by image-based submissions.

This election season, Big Bird. While these issues are of sizable importance to
people and [felt puppets](http://www.dailydot.com/news/million-puppet-march-big-bird-public-media/) everywhere

You might view your toaster as nothing more than a device that crispens a few slices of bread for your breakfast each morning. Its feelings, if any, importance to you. Sadly, such ignorance has allowed these beloved kitchen staples to make it all the way to the 21st century without even the most basic rights that you take for granted.

Fortunately, has been created to raise awareness of the injustices being experienced by toasters everywhere. Thanks to redditor [THE_HUMAN_TREE](http://www.reddit.com/user/THE_HUMAN_TREE), the devices finally have a voice.

“This subreddit was originally created (by me) to grant toasters the right of gay marriage, while toasters are being shoved out of the spotlight.”

Fellow moderator [nicksatdown](http://www.reddit.com/user/nicksatdown) believes that toasters are not only being ignored

“They have been mistreated for years, treated like garbage. We are here to spread awareness of the misuse and abuse!”

It wasn’t always so bad for toasters. As recently as 20 years ago

“Twenty years ago they were treated like Apple products are today. Fresh metal painted bodies. Respect

THE_HUMAN_TREE agrees.

&gt;“Twenty years ago
revolutionary in the appliance industry

Unfortunately, but also as a clock or timer. While the versatility and efficiency that these appliances have enjoyed is commendable, their main purposes tend to get lost in the confusion. Toasters, while appearing simple, lack this setback.

Another invites discussion on the issues faced by[ female toasters](http://www.reddit.com/r/ToasterRights/comments/10sdmj/apparently_the_brave_little_toaster_wasis_a_girl/).

“Even though toasters’ rights have come a far way in the last 20 years

Election Day is nearing. You will soon step into the voting booth and help decide the fate of your fellow citizens. While this is going on
at the polls.

It doesn’t have to be this way

“One dictionary definition of ‘nice’” Wong [began](http://www.quora.com/Yishan-Wong/Posts-by-Yishan/Be-Nice-Rule-Considered-Harmful) in his excoriating post from Sep. 9, agreeable, or amiable.’ These things are not conducive to serious and civil discussion, or an effective search for the truth. In fact, it is actively harmful and one of the most perniciously destructive.”

He continued in [a follow-up post](http://www.quora.com/Yishan-Wong/Posts-by-Yishan/More-About-Be-Nice-And-Why-Its-Bad):

&gt;The discussion of controversial topics cannot happen if there is a requirement to be nice. Controversial topics are controversial because they make people uncomfortable. They are intrinsically neither pleasing nor agreeable. In fact

Wong suggested turning the rule to “be civil” or “be respectful.” Beyond that,” he suggested, presciently.

Community:


Are there people who frequent the sub whose usernames you would recognize? How many (a lot/some/a fairly good amount/etc.)? Do people get aggressive/overzealous with downvotes? Is there a lot of fighting/aggressiveness in the comments or is it usually a fairly polite area? On the scale of /r/atheism to /r/askscience

Moderatorship:

How active are the mods on this subreddit and on reddit in general? How often do they leave undistinguished comments on the various links and self posts here? How often do they submit content?  How well-written and understandable is the sidebar? Do you like the CSS?

How ban-happy are the mods? Have there been instances when you felt a comment was removed unfairly? On the scale of /r/lgbt to /r/askscience

Slaterhearst, [as I reported earlier this week](http://www.dailydot.com/society/atlantic-slaterhearst-jared-keller-reddit/), was actually The Atlantic’s social media editor Jared Keller, who spammed Reddit with thousands of links to Atlantic Media sites over the course of a year and likely brought millions of new visitors to the company.

(Interestingly, was also banned recently).

Reddit’s democratic system makes it easy for spammers like this to justify what they’re doing: Submissions are only successful once they hit that critical mass upvotes. So long as there isn’t any vote-rigging going on

Reddit's general manager Erik Martin, and why have such a strict policy about self-promotion in the first place? It’s possible the two were involved in vote-rigging. There’s absolutely zero evidence to prove this, however, and Reddit generally refuses to speak on individual bans, so as not to tip off other spammers to new tricks.

There is a real problem with spam-by-volume submitters, making it that much easier for The Atlantic to break news on Reddit.

That may do more harm than good in the long run

1334347460.0,s8g71,"This week on Reddit: A sick hoax, F7U12 quits early, and disappearing lightning bugs",kmmokai,17,1

The redditor was Black_Visions, and was subsequently harassed in the thread. He then disappeared from Reddit, never to be seen again. His suicide threat was posted to [/r/MensRights](/r/MensRights), and the trolls harassing him had allegedly come from that subreddit’s frequent ideological enemy [/r/ShitRedditSays](/r/ShitRedditSays). 

On Thursday

“Our family has decided to take legal action” against “those who urged him to take his own life

Redditors upvoted those allegations to the top of [r/subredditdrama](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/s5cwt/mensrights_suicide_post_was_real_reddit/), in the hoax’s final coup, the massive [r/askreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s60bw/a_month_ago_a_suicidal_redditor_left_his_final/). Multiple websites copied the allegations as well, without using a bit of critical thinking in their analyses. Meanwhile, the sister, who said her real name was “Sandy,” never provided a hint of evidence. Sure,or.r_gc.r_pw.

Seattle police later [confirmed](http://www.dailydot.com/news/reddits-wrongful-death-lawsuit-hoax/) the story was likely made-up. The woman said her brother’s name was Jerry and that he had a wife and a daughter. But the man who died in Washington--the man whose death the troll decided to use to prove some kind of sick point--wasn’t named Jerry and didn’t have a family. Case closed.

The largest push to reveal the hoax came from redditors themselves, seemed to bear responsibility for a man’s death? Or was it because the allegations themselves seemed to prove how comments on Reddit actually matter, that they bear serious and even deadly real-world consequences?

1330106675.0,q4bnt,This Week on Reddit: Sushileaks,kmmokai,14,1,4,"Reddit was rocked this week by a [spate](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/q0aq9/hueypriest_informs_a_poweruser_that_he_has_plans/) of leaks of private chat logs involving the site’s top moderators and paid staff.

The most blockbuster revelation: power user [karmanaut](http://reddit.com/user/karmanaut) is the same person as [ProbablyHittingOnYou](http://reddit.com/user/probablyhittongonyou). Both sit at the top of Redit’s comment karma ranking. More importantly

This deception—at the top of the site’s most populous communities—has laid bare flaws in Reddit’s hierarchical structure

**

Many of the leaks were revealed by [sushisushisushi](http://reddit.com/user/sushisushisushi). They’re now known as [Sushileaks](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/q0aq9/hueypriest_informs_a_poweruser_that_he_has_plans/c3tnu6s).

One interesting response to the Sushileaks fiasco: Why [should anyone care](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/q3cl5/why_default_mod_drama_should_interest_you/) about the squabbles of Reddit moderators? They’re just a bunch of pseudonymous Internet strangers.

Reddit’s default subreddits—the [20 communities](http://blog.reddit.com/2011/10/saying-goodbye-to-old-friend-and.html) every person subscribes to automatically when they sign up—are huge. Each drive hundreds of thousands of unique visitors daily. That’s enough traffic to make each place a valuable online property in its own right.

Right now, control a huge proportion of Reddit, Inc’s traffic.

Moderators are unpaid volunteers. A subreddit is theirs to alter, because most are hard-working volunteers who really care about the community.

But as karmanaut’s multiple-personality proclivity shows, 32bites, [decided to shut it down](http://www.dailydot.com/news/popular-iama-section-reddit-shut-down/).

Subreddit subscriptions should function in a kind of free market—if you don’t like the way a community is run

If you want to make a competitor to, you’ll be handicapped from the start: You won’t just be competing with an established subscriber base in the millions; you’ll be fighting against the explicit support and endorsement of Reddit HQ.

What’s the practical value of that support? An endless stream of new subscribers thanks to the community’s default status, preferential access to the site’s paid staff.

“Moderators, and are not appointed by reddit.”

That’s patently false.

Reddit’s default subscription system has created a privileged class of semi-official moderators. Most are hard working. Most clearly want to keep Reddit running smoothly and help the community flourish.

But the system that created them is broken",,t5_2so3f,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/dailydot/comments/q4bnt/this_week_on_reddit_sushileaks/

This week belonged to Reddit’s atheists.

Over the weekend,000 for renowned medical charity Doctors Without Borders](http://www.dailydot.com/society/reddit-atheists-doctors-without-borders-charity/).

When I asked [/r/atheism](/r/atheism) moderator [tuber](http://www.reddit.com/user/tuber) if he had any point to prove with the fundraising drive, save lives, or both,” tuber wrote in a message. “Sending a message is not a significant motivator for me.”

Still, they seemed to be saying, are just as charitable as anyone else.

Ulterior motives hardly take away from what the subreddit has accomplished. FirstGiving rep Dina Pradel [told me](http://www.dailydot.com/news/reddit-atheists-charity-doctors-without-borders/) their most successful campaigns often hinge on some kind of group event or activity: a run, the ulterior motive was proving atheists are good people. Nothing wrong with that.

There was one fairly significant difference

“These guys are really superstars of fundraising

[r/RepublicOfReddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/RepublicOfReddit) launches today (in beta

Here's our[ full story](http://www.dailydot.com/society/republic-of-reddit-launch) on the Republic's launch.

One thing that really stood out about the people behind this: They've put a lot of thought and effort into a website and community they seem to care about deeply. 

They've got some interesting thoughts on what makes subreddits work

I had a Reddit-sitdown with just a few of these guys. Here's a slightly edited version of that interview. 

Many thanks to Wordslinger1919 and jaxspider for setting this all up.

~~~~

***Starting with the basics: What exactly is Republic of Reddit?***

**syncretic:** The Republic of Reddit is a network of subreddits that aim to provide well moderated alternatives to the default subreddits


**blackstar9000:** There's basically two parts to the idea, which like the rediquette, only with more spine.


**Aguyinachair:** In the end though, then it's not really that impressive. Considering what syncretic has done with the SFWPorn series though, I think we've got a good shot.

***How many subreddits are you creating and managing?***


**syncretic:** There are currently a total of eight subreddits in the network, gaming, atheism, politics and music. There is definitely some sort of news subreddit on the way, and I have been mulling over the idea of a wtf subreddit.


**Aguyinachair:** I don't think there will be any upper limit on how many that could/should be created however
Who came up with the idea and where did it gestate? When was this? What were the steps for moving from idea to reality?


**syncretic:** About a month ago, but things evolved from there [pretty quickly](http://www.reddit.com/r/RepublicOfReddit/comments/k2agy/discussion_thread/).


**blackstar9000:** The steps are a little hard to follow, and we've been making a concerted effort to have as close to zero discussions in mod mail as possible, so nearly the whole of the decision-making process will be available for anyone with the fortitude to wade through it.


**Aguyinachair:** When the admins made a statement confirming that mods were the ones in control of the subreddits, it just made it clear that moderators had a right to do what they wanted with the subreddits they had. As far as developing the idea, it became a practice of finding the best way to provide a better experience for the people who were tired of memes, but doing so without affecting the majority of the user base that does enjoy them.

This was the same issue which reddit faced literally a couple years ago, not to mention that the spread of memes always left the smaller subreddits open to being 'ruined' in the same way as the original places. The only way we saw to fix the problem would be to actively remove things that didn't belong,, but doing so in the larger subreddits would mean upsetting the majority of new members. RoR basically is a soft reset on reddit as a whole, a chance for the people who want less meme content to join up with the knowledge that off-topic posts will be actively moderated.

We wanted to learn more about Abercrombie and his family's reaction to his posthumous popularity on reddit. So

~~~~

For a long time, a part of me thought, ""Well, I should post pictures of my grandfather on reddit.""  But, to be honest, I never bothered.  Reddit can be a harsh mistress and after I saw the success of other user's family members, I wasn't sure that I could take the rejection if mine happened to be the one where the tides changed and reddit decided it had enough of grandparents and such.

With our book about him and my grandmother finally complete, but this pride made me also feel as I were somehow bragging when it came up.  So for a long time, I hadn't really conversed with anyone about his career and accomplishments.  But with the book out, I was given another chance to tell people about him.  And it sort of reminded me that what he had done in life was remarkable and worth sharing—when I tell people about what he did, they just can't believe it, they want to meet him or, just as often

So between reddit's (apparent) love of grandparents and such, him leading a caravan of 1000s of camels, a shot of him behind the wheel of the maharaja's chrome-bodied Rolls Royce (I think), playing buz kashi in Afghanistan (think polo with the body of a goat for a ball), removing a pilgrim's frostbit toe while seeking the source of the Indus River, and receiving the Baltic Cup for Sailing from the prince of Denmark.  At the same, though

As far as the reaction of reddit, aside from a few links that I'd passed along to her.  She Facebooks (that's a verb, right?), and has a Facebook page for Tom.  She has seen popular success with that page, with Tom gathering about 300 ""fans"" from all around the world.  Tom made friends wherever he went, and many stayed his friend over the years.  But Facebook is obviously different than reddit—it's for people who already know you, or in this case, I imagine, when she posts something about Tom or the book, I believe

My grandfather's reaction to it, I think had he had the time to made the transition to a digital world, he would have appreciated all that it offers.  Taking after him, my uncle loves to go to Youtube and see what contraptions people are building, and to get ideas for DIY projects for himself.  As it was, he was just getting into the world of digital photography when he passed, but a Geographic photographer had to love the idea of not having to carry around dozens or even 100s of rolls of film with him into the field.  I never really knew his views on media and journalism, and that the users of the site, but that's besides the point.  I think this possibility of reddit and the internet in general would have greatly appealled to him—the possibility to bring together people from around the world into a forum where they can share ideas

Really, or rather understood, his popularity on reddit.  Whenever he'd share a story, it was never to brag or to boast, but just to join in the conversation.  The way that if you were talking about movies with a friend, he or she might mention a movie they'd seen, Tom would mention his trips to the Sahara or the South Pole.  Never to one-up, just a book of some of his pictures since so many said he should.  (Once when I was returning home from Florida and I mentioned the heat, ""Oh yeah.  Heat sucks.  I was in the Sahara

SOPA threatens the Internet as we know it. Redditors, SOPA has dominated Reddit’s front page for months now.  

That’s why Reddit [is turning off the lights for 12 hours to protest on Jan. 18](http://www.dailydot.com/politics/breaking-reddit-blackout-sopa-protest/). As I [noted earlier this week](http://www.dailydot.com/politics/reddit-sopa-blackout-protest-interview/)

In that sense

“We want to make it impossible not to cover [SOPA]

One media voice that’s been surprisingly silent on SOPA is the Daily Show’s Jon Stewart.

No worries! Redditor have that covered

[dhlvl2717](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/jga45/reddit_wrestles_with_violence_and_misogyny/c2bx1xt):

&gt;There's a reason subreddits exist. It's to divide one aspect of the community with the other incompatible aspects of it. Meaning that all the women can go in one place and all the jokes about beating women can go in the other. They don't want to have anything to do with each other and so they stay away from each other. So I think the article is making too big a deal out of it. This is the internet. The internet doesn't give us anything except freedom. And if you're not happy with what you see other people doing

Meanwhile

[fxexular](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/jgnh1/thedailydot_reddit_wrestles_with_violence_and/c2bxmy4):

&gt;I think racism is a bigger issue on this website than misogyny. I compiled a list of some racism recently and it didn't take very long to get over a hundred highly-upvoted examples. I'm compiling another one for misogyny and it's taking longer to do!
&gt;I'd be happy if this stuff were banned. Conde Naste is a private company and this is their website, and the perverted folk heroes of reddit who run them, are PR disasters waiting to happen.

&gt;I think Reddit would survive if outright racist

[LyannaStark](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/jgnh1/thedailydot_reddit_wrestles_with_violence_and/c2bxxbn)

&gt;I draw a line where the law draws it, but all it's saying is that only people who agree with you have the right to self-expression without persecution.

Finally, [the redditor claimed differently](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:gFjkY61TB7IJ:www.reddit.com/hi5up+%22reddits+i+moderate%22+violentacrez&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;source=www.google.com).

One thing that speaks even louder than two billion page views,000 after an AMA](http://www.dailydot.com/politics/rob-zerban-paul-ryan-sopa-reddit/), it was only a matter of time before other politicians began stampeding through Reddit’s gates.

And as for those two billion page views: Reddit’s traffic numbers from 2011 demonstrate some astonishing growth. The site [has octupled in size from two years ago

How much more can Reddit expand? Is the site becoming bloated

The fact is, it’s quickly becoming a centralized hub of discussion online. 

Of course, the site simply needs better tools for moderation, discovery, and customization.

For his part

&gt;There are redditors who feel reddit is getting too big, help new users better understand the way reddit works, and provide better tools to support the moderators of both big and small subreddits. We're also going to keep improving the infrastructure so that the site will be faster and more stable even as growth continues.

We were really happy to see so many people come to our defense, and we're not big enough to screw the little guy. I hope we never become that, but the popular meme is to vilify everything as if it we're Enron, and damn the specifics.

This was absolutely not a planned PR stunt by us. I believe Boomer was planning the PR stunt. We just took the bait. 

**How long have you been working on the game

We've been working on Jurassic Park for about a year now. It's easily our most ambitious project to date, so we've always been pretty active in the community, and accepting of it warts and all. I think we have a reputation of doing the right thing and really trying to treat our customers well. Our history speaks for itself in this regard. 


**What about online witch hunts?
**

These are interesting times. The internet is indeed a powerful tool that can really empower people to make real change in the world. The last presidential election is the best proof of that that I can think of, but I also believe we're on a bit of an infancy as a responsible internet society, and that as we grow-up, things like this will become less common. The good news is it would appear in this case that those who didn't jump to conclusions and remanded objective are going to be the real winners, which is how I hope it always would be.",,False,t5_2so3f,True

**Even though you lost

Actually part of the reason I came up with the bee suit idea is in college I had a summer job working for a company that would remove wasp and hornet nests for free and then send them to pharmaceutical companies where they made some sort of potion out of them or something. Anyway

It's funny though. Once at that job I didn't zip up my suit properly, so you know you're going to get it. This time, with my home made suit, when I heard the buzzing and realized it was inside, I felt the exact same panic. It was like going back in time. That's why I grabbed the bee spray so fast and sprayed myself. I didn't want to get the shit stung out of me again. And removing a helmet with all that duct tape would take even longer.

**Can you be more specific about your preparations? What was the exact type of weaponry

Equipment: I used things I scavenged in the basement. I had an old hard hat I got at a garage sale. I realized the metal side panel of an old computer case had a grill that I could see through, a heavy coat (which was hot as fuck on a hot night), boots and gardening gloves. Oh and my trusty cheap ass vacuum. I let that thing run for like an hour by the way after I sucked up those 80 bees. They were spinning the whole time. When I finally turned it off the little Terminator bastards were still moving. So I turned it back on and sprayed bee killer in the hose.


Alcohol: I'd drank a six pack while I was making the suit. Then I started putting it on and feeling nervous, I realized a straw could fit through the grill. I think it was that last shot through the straw that put me firmly in the 'too drunk' category.

**What did you think about Reddit's reaction?**

There are two things I've absolutely loved about this. When I woke up the next morning I had a brutal hangover, etc. So that was really cool, that something went from being a failure to being something that made a lot of people I'll never meet smile and laugh. And I don't mind that I'm a bit of the clown in this scenario, my self-esteem can handle that. 

The second thing I love are the funny things people have done with the images. Those are making me laugh my ass off. I especially love the one that looks like a Grindhouse movie poster. Have you seen it? I've already printed it 8x10 and I'm going to frame it.

tl;dr [read our short piece here](http://www.dailydot.com/culture/redditor-puts-memes-their-own-place/).

Otherwise


**Why? Do you think memes/rage comics/etc. lower the quality of discourse? Are they inherently bad or just out of place?**


Well,000+) where images, and especially memes, tend to dominate the front page and push other, more in-depth content out. It's just the nature of Reddit's voting system. Memes are quick, disposable content, usually provoking a good laugh. It takes only seconds from click &gt; laugh &gt; upvote. As a result, for example

Now, the top link is usually a picture, but other content like self posts and articles are still visible on the front page, because there just isn't the large quantity of new submissions in a smaller subreddit that there is in a larger one. Users still have a choice about what type of content they want to consume without digging deeper into the subreddit such as the ""new"" or ""rising"" queue. Most people don't bother, and just move onto another subreddit.
Without the support of the mods themselves, the night I created a6theism10, 12 out of the top 20 submissions in /r/atheism were rage comics. That's completely unacceptable in my opinion, and most people can agree that's excessive. Reddit is for the most part a democracy, users are free to submit or vote how they wish. I am simply trying to sway public opinion through a grassroots campaign. I want to ""bitch less and do more"".


**As for your experimental subreddits themselves: How have they been working? Has there been a noticeable decline in rage comics featured on r/atheism?**



The first subreddit I created, which is awesome for a brand new subreddit. One thing I've noticed is that most rage comics (if I had to guess, I'd say 60%) are downvoted in /r/atheism and hidden from view of the front page right now. The ones that do well, do very well, usually hitting the front page. However, the vote totals are very conflicted. Usually comics that have over a thousand upvotes have only a few hundred positive karma, meaning a large number of people downvoted the comic. So far, some with many more upvotes than they had in the larger subreddit. I've seen some submissions that had negative karma in /r/atheism reach 20 or 30 karma in a6theism10


AdviceAtheists is newer, which is about half the rate of growth that a6theism10 has had, but it's nothing to scoff at.


I haven't seen any noticable decline in the memes in /r/atheism, I've added about 100 approved submitters, give or take, between both subreddits, and I've seen a total of two people that have submitted a meme to /r/atheism after I tagged them. I call that a 98% success rate ;)


**Assuming this experiment works, but I'm curious).**


I have no idea, and the only one I can think of that has a similar problem is /r/gaming. Deimorz, a moderator of /r/gaming, is trying a completely different approach. He's created a new subreddit called /r/filteredgaming and he runs a bot that scans every new submission to gaming, filters out images and other posts he deems undesirable (not sure how he decided that, excatly), and submits a link to the submission at /r/filteredgaming. It's sort of the same premise that /r/bestof operates on, really
I'm really just trying to duplicate what happened to /r/pics and /r/funny with the creation of f7u12 and /r/AdviceAnimals. Anyone who was on Reddit before those two subreddits were created can remember the front page of /r/pics and /r/funny were absolutely dominated by those two memes, and it became taboo to post them in most other subreddits (there are exceptions, such as /r/gaming and /r/atheism). For instance, try posting a rage comic about books in /r/books and see what happens. I have several times, as a test, and they were all downvoted immediately.


**Finally: What kind of reaction have you received from other redditors?**


So far it's been great. Users are excited when I add them as an Approved Submitter, everyone likes to be noticed, don't they? I'm basically saying that I value their contribution and I think they should come submit tomy subreddits instead of /r/atheism. If enough people do this, I think it can bring real change to the front page of /r/atheism. People who hate rage comics love the idea because they will see them less (they won't subscribe). People who love rage comics love the idea because they will see them more (they will subscribe), and their submissions will be downvoted less. I really don't see how anyone can not think this is a good idea, really, especially as the subreddits grow larger and larger, but I know how to get shit done when it comes to new subreddits. I don't have any doubt in my mind that I can get these rolling in some form or fashion. I just don't know how successful they will be in the long term

1312552344.0,j9uow,"""The web is really only a gift for artists"" -- Our full interview with ""Everything Was Perfect"" artist Zac Gorman.",kmmokai,8,2,0,"Comic artist [Zac Gorman](http://zacgorman.com/)

**Daily Dot: For starters

Zac Gorman: I grew up in Dearborn, and I was always drawing. I used to draw on that 8.5 x 11, white printer paper that everybody has laying around, but I have these very vivid memories of my dad bringing home reams of that green and white printout paper from work once in a while, that paper that was really popular in the 80's--the stuff with the holes along the perforated edges--I used to love that stuff, because it was just one long sheet of paper that went on forever. I used to design fairly complicated board games on there. I always loved games of all kinds, not just video games, that's when my life changed forever. It was actually a gift for my older brother


**DD: How you got into creating video game themed art? Did you go to college for graphic art?
**

Gorman: Actually, and I used to go over to his house for sleepovers and after everybody would fall asleep, I'd be up all night creating animations and designing stamps. There was something magical about creating art on a screen that just clicked with me. I got my first tablet when I went to Kendall College of Art and Design in Grand Rapids, Mich., for two years after attending community college. I studied illustration while I was there and it was a really great chance to begin to find a voice as an artist. Just being surrounded by other talented artists and concentrating on making art for a couple years was really formative.

**DD: What is it about video game characters like Link that have inspired you? Do you see a little bit of Link in you?
**

Gorman: I think that Link has always had a special place in my heart. When I was a kid and we used to play pretend, impossible world and I think there was a connection there. Link, this little, ill-equipped (at least at first), elf-boy from the forest, has this impossible task set in front of him and he just keeps going, no matter what

**DD: ""Everything was perfect
**

Gorman: “Everything Was Perfect, it's why we love them. With a comic like that, it's really about just finding that sensation that you felt when you played that game for the first time and just holding onto it for long enough to draw the comic. If the feeling isn't there in you when you draw it, people won't respond to it.

**DD: What inspired you to make certain parts of your pieces animated?**

Gorman: The idea of integrating .gif animations into comics was an idea that was quite frankly ""borrowed"" from other artists who were already doing it. I only tried to do it better (or at least as well). My whole approach to it, although often I feel that I come up short on my own criteria. I suppose it's also about giving webcomic readers something that they can't get from print. There are a lot of downsides to reading comics on a screen, so I figured that I should have fun exploring some of the upsides.

**DD: In this day in age where people are so concerned with receiving credit for their creations

Gorman:  I think that the web is really only a gift for artists. If nothing else, will find you, and the people who just want to look at it, enjoy it for a second or two and then move on with their lives (most people), wouldn't click your link if it was plastered all over the page. Just keep doing work you're proud of and putting it out online, make it as easy to find as possible and hope for some good reblogs.

**DD: Any advice for aspiring artists?
**

Gorman: I've had a number of people ask me for advice lately, ""just be a good person."" This isn't just new age, hippie stuff either. You'd be amazed at how much better your ""luck"" is when you go out of your way to be a decent, cool, honest person to everybody you meet either online or face to face. It's probably the most important thing for any artist to remember.

For me, the rest of my life would be spent splitting time between drawing comics and playing video games, with occasional Mountain Dew breaks.",,False,,t5_2so3f,,http://www.reddit.com/r/dailydot/comments/j9uow/the_web_is_really_only_a_gift_for_artists_our/

But by doing so, it could be encouraging its members to downvote those very same comments. It may seems like insignificant subreddit drama. It’s not. 

Downvote brigades are a kind of cheating that fundamentally undermine how Reddit works—democratically sorting posts within communities. By selectively targeting certain comments

For their part, they encourage readers to upvote nasty comments -- what better way could there be to highlight them, after all?

We pointed out that both the accounts had a history of Reddit trolling. We made no conclusions about the intent of the people behind the accounts, but did not receive a reply in time for publication.

KILL365 and ohblair, they say. The magazine itself is intended to highlight the very best of the site. 

On Saturday KILL365 and ohblair reached out to us. Here is their full response.

**

To call KILL365 a troll account would be accurate. But a troll account and negative downvotes is hardly a direct link to ill intention. The question is


The point is, easy novelty accounts.. If you go to AskReddit, you'll see a thread with 500 upvotes and 8000 comments. People care more about their voice than reading others. I'm tired of having to go out of my way to avoid the immature content every day on front page. The way the average user thinks has become so obvious, I realized I can have more fun by tricking them, than trying to and argue. With KILL365, I will leave relatively innocent comments or opinions, and either watch people jump on it like a pack of wolves, it will actually start a real discussion.


So, user generated content. This is in my opinion what Reddit should be more about. Like the cover compared to the content of our magazine, it is a complete joke on the surface, but if you look deeper you can find some great posts. The purpose of the magazine is simply to give more attention to the people who I feel are more of a value to this site than the people reposting reposts from gifdump from 4chan from 2008. The first issue's mock cover was simply to show the gossipy headline nature of Reddit. To call out the ridiculousness. When everyone said they would actually read a reddit magazine, it became obvious to me that a this could succeed, and I took the initiative to launch it how I would like to see it.
If a reddit magazine was made with other intentions in mind, it becomes something unique and far more interesting.


The people behind the first issue were myself and OhBlair


I thought in your first article

My last comments are about the donation aspect to this. This was a main point in your article questioning our motives. In my honest opinion, if I decide tomorrow that I'm done making these, the whole thing is done. People are willing to toss a few dollars our way in support. We're not charging a penny, we haven't plugged the donate link a single time. I don't think we're stepping on any toes at Conde Nast. The people who's posts we used had already posted it on a free website, and had also given us permission to feature. This was a very small project to begin with, and I thought it was perfectly reasonable to accept donations from those who were offering. The Reddit team has been supportive and even featuring us in their front page ads.


That said, I don't want people to think their money went nowhere. So while I'm getting absolutely nothing from this anymore, perhaps you will believe my motives were genuine.",,False,,t5_2so3f,,http://www.reddit.com/r/dailydot/comments/jqxeu/kill365_responds_says_the_redditors_purpose_is_to/

1313789431.0,joa1y,"This week on reddit: chili, ice baths, ice chili baths, beating a dead horse, The Redditor,kmmokai,http://www.reddit.com/r/dailydot/comments/joa1y/this_week_on_reddit_chili_ice_baths_ice_chili/

The seemingly irrevocable march of [image memes](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/jku3h/going_camping_heres_how_to_stay_clean_and_have_a/) based on image memes based on insider jokes [based on chili and ice showers](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/jinex/shower_to_go/) was so terrifying to some that [they committed reddit suicide](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/jlo87/a_thread_where_many_accounts_selfterminate_i_find/c2d5kxn). (A meaningless, considering how easy it is to create a new account. But, still: they did lose their karma!)

That kind of predictable dependence on recycling content -- of beating memes into the ground and possibly all the way to China -- is the exact kind of behavior that Reddit trolls love to hate.

But some Reddit trolls seem to have reformed themselves. 

ohblair and KILL365 [launched the first real issue of The Redditor this week](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/jmseq/the_redditor_issue_2_august_2011_plus_40_page_pdf/), with the editors claiming it was “a community effort, embracing the community, for the community.” 

Redditors loved it, with an impressive comment karma nearing -3,000; and [ohblair](http://www.reddit.com/user/ohblair), also a troll of sorts, with a user history that paints a picture of someone with no small amount of disdain for Reddit. 

These two trolls

All they’re [asking for are some small donations](http://www.theredditor.com).

[Nothing fishy there](http://dailydot.com/news/new-reddit-magazine-launches/).
