**I'm not sure of the exact statistics but I think UT is in the top 5 (2nd?) of bike theft universities and surrounding areas**

1. Invest in a good U-lock

2. Properly secure your bike! DON'T LOCK THE FRONT WHEEL ONLY! It takes less than a minute for someone with a wrench to unscrew your front wheel and bam
Instead lock like this: [Good day sir](http://i.imgur.com/VCfxr.png). If you rock two locks like I do: [safe](http://i.imgur.com/UFrW3.png).

3. Always make sure that what you are securing your bike to is secure itself! Unfortunately there are a number of rack on campus and **tons of racks off campus (west campus)** that are broken, not bolted down at all, or otherwise compromised in some way. I have seen, first hand and in the flesh, two guys on 26th hoisting an entire rack with 3 bikes attached to it onto their pickup truck! (We stopped them) 

4. If you live in an apartment complex I'd recommend taking the bike up to your room instead of locking outside your complex. It might seem inconvenient but it eliminates any doubt about your bike over night.

5. **PLEASE TRY TO OBSERVE TEXAS BICYCLE LAWS. ALSO


6. If you like to ride beyond commuting join the UT cycling club! Or at least call me up for some rides! :D There are plenty of social rides around Austin

7. Register your bike with UT Parking and Transportation. They help as much as they can in tracking down your bike if it's stolen. Also the sticker is a good deterrent! You can do it online [here](http://www.utexas.edu/parking/transportation/biking/bicycle_register.html). Or you can fill out a paper form and get your sticker immediately at the bicycle service stop on Speedway. 


**TL;DR**

1. Get a U-lock. Cables are trash and give you cancer

2. Lock properly

3. Location and condition of where you lock is important

4. Same as #3

5. Don't be a dumbfuck!

6. Ride with me :D Or UT cycling

7. Register your bike with UT Parking and Transportation!

* **Living On-Campus Freshman Year**

Take the conventional time-tested wisdom of staying on-campus your Freshman year (and maybe even your Sophomore year too) as it LARGELY contributes to not just the ""freshman"" experience

It makes dating Freshman year much easier (although I don't recommend that you only eat in, has got some neat places well within walking distance).

If you intend to start off your college career living off-campus, you can't sleep in ten minutes 'til your next class then fumble out of bed to get there on time. Not that I recommend it, but the option's there should you need it.

* **Living Off-Campus**

I've often found that living off-campus is more feasible and enjoyable when sharing an apartment or house with REALLY GOOD friends (Note: not singular 'friend') that you've made the year prior in college. Someone with the same work ethic and base principles, someone who you might eagerly anticipate talking to after a long/exciting day. They don't necessarily even have to be the same major, although that helps too. 

So start making friends the moment you get here, these sorts of people are out there doing the same looking for you.

* **Cafeteria Food VS. Cooking All Your Own Meals**

As per dorm food

But as a student who has to cook for himself on a small budget, carry all my groceries onto the bus by myself, then finally get home, perform contortions of the most baffling sort just trying to fit everything into my college-staple mini fridge, then finally *cook* my food, and serve it. All of this totaling maybe 3-4 hours. *But damn if it isn't rewarding.*

And I'm not the greatest chef either, and value of the cafeteria food should be considered with appreciation and financial perspective.

* **Greek Life**

**EDIT:** My impression of Greek life has been moved to the comments as it did not fitfully address the lifestyle. Read [u/Purplehooloovoo](http://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/1cvxr4/advice_for_incoming_freshman_regarding_life_at_ut/c9kllcv)'s perspective on Greek life at UT.

* **Co-Ops**

**EDIT:**[u/carpetstain](http://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/1cvxr4/advice_for_incoming_freshman_regarding_life_at_ut/c9krsqb)'s thoughts and experiences of UT Co-ops.

There are a lot of co-ops on West Campus

They're $3.50 a box and we'll be starting with all 8 flavors. And if things work out we'll be able to take credit cards! 

I was going to post on here tomorrow when we leave but that's during the SOPA/PIPA blackout...  We probably won't be there past 5:00-5:30.

Unfortunately we can't take online orders or pre-orders. Hope to see you there.

[UPDATE:]
Wow - that was insane. Parked near 22nd and it took almost 30 minutes to get to 24th since we were stopped every few feet to make a sale! Hope we didn't disappoint anyone by being late. Saw at least two fellow Redditors &lt;*wave*&gt; :)  We ran out of almost 3 cases of Thin Mints and 2+ cases of Caramel Delights (Samoas). I'm looking into getting some more for tomorrow or Friday but won't know for a little while - will make a separate post with the new date then.

&gt; 
Colleagues

&gt;As many of you may know, The University of Texas at Austin is currently working to evaluate and adapt its current ""No Smoking"" policy, which will ultimately preserve tens of millions of dollars in funding for cancer research. In the days ahead we will consult the leadership of groups representing UT faculty, staff, and students.

&gt;As a premier research institution, and safety of our students, faculty, staff, and visitors. Any new tobacco use policy will seek to complement other university health initiatives including smoking cessation programs, our sustainable green building design standards, and our efforts to adopt a campus culture of wellness for students, staff and visitors. Student Government passed a resolution in 2011 supporting a tobacco-free campus.

&gt;As we get closer to establishing compliant policy


As a heavy smoker, I see smokers who shamelessly exhale clouds of smoke into large masses of people between classes, and I'm even put off by it on behalf of the non-smokers. They could at *least* find a non-offensive smokers cove or perform the dragon technique (where you cock your head and blow smoke vertically into the air so that it rises above the noses of people). This is mainly due to the fact that most college kids haven't been smoking for long enough to develop a sense of etiquette, but there's also a dash of self-centered-ness at work too. 


Though I think that an absolute banishment of tobacco is a bit extreme (and would would much prefer designated smoking areas)

Join them in solidarity at the Human Rights Round-up now in the west mall to help make UT sweatshop free!

**Update**: all 18 protesters were arrested and charged with trespassing (class B misdemeanor) at 5:00 when the tower closed. President Powers never came to speak with them.
Back story: UT makes the most money on collegiate apparel in the world. Their over 4, so pretty much the people on the board are the ones making the money from the sweatshops. The whole reason this ""occupy Powers' office"" occurred is because he has repeatedly REFUSED to meet with USAS (United Students Against Sweatshops) representatives and they wanted to make themselves heard. A member of USAS actually traveled to a few of these sweatshops in Central and South America and has video documentation of workers describing their workplace conditions. They are fired if they attempt to form unions and are deprived of even the simplest things such as using the bathroom during 12 hour work days. **The only thing USAS wants to do now is to get UT to stop working with the FLA and to instead work with the WCA (Worker Rights Consortium)** who already works with over 150 universities in the US and promotes fair workplace conditions.That's all they want Powers to do. But he refuses to speak with them. Mu guess is that he doesn't want to upset Nike who sponsors pretty much all the athletic events for UT. But who knows.

(Disclosure: I posted this yesterday right before Reddit went down so it didn't see much traffic but here's my second encounter)

This morning, but I recognized the voice. I look up and IT'S HIM. It's the scumbag that sold me the bogus sound equipment.

At this point, why it's so shitty, and I want my money back. He says he doesn't have time right now (he was literally mid-transaction with another customer who he was about to con) and tries to give me his number to ""call him later"". Guess what? It's the same bogus number from the first time and I call him out on it. He then gives me another number saying it's his real phone number and I can call him later. So I pull out my phone and begin to call it, and he starts walking out of the store claiming his phone is ""in his car"". Knowing this is more bullshit being spewed out of his mouth I follow him to his car. He had a partner with him this time. The con and his partner get in their car and drive off but I managed to get their license plate and the car make/model:

Silver Toyota 4Runner with black rims and black racks on top. Plate: DT8 R972

Some features of this new network:

* Complete anonymity (Yes I am serious, **and publishing**.)

* Consistent Megabyte+ download speed.

* Bandwidth usage isn't counted in Resnet or any on-campus access point. (All connections remain on campus.)

* Encrypted and undetectable.

* Decentralized


**How is it possible?**


We use a program called [RetroShare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroshare) which uses a PGP 'web-of-trust' model. You only ever directly connect to your friends

You can anonymously (Or non-anonymously.) publish files for others to download. As long as there is at least one person in the web who has a copy of the file

**Why are you doing this?**


A bit of history...

Up until about a year ago this campus had a file-sharing community that used a protocol called [Direct Connect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Connect_%28file_sharing%29). In fact

&gt; Hey I'm sorry man but IT has blocked our access and we are trying to get it online but it's pretty grim

What the **FUCK?!** How am I supposed to download those Java ebooks now?!

[OH SHIT SON!](http://i.imgur.com/I4Zyh.png)

Pretty isn't it? Almost like Limewire except it doesn't suck. This new system is encrypted and decentralized

**Some other pics**

[Talking to people via pseudo-mail and IM. (All still anonymous.)](http://i.imgur.com/GeZ6V.png)

[Forums (Anonymous and signed variants.)](http://i.imgur.com/KeKN7.png)

[Searching for a collection of files.](http://i.imgur.com/U5DNm.png)

[Downloading a file someone has allowed their friends to view.](http://i.imgur.com/xg1Dk.png)

[Consistent high speed downloads.](http://i.imgur.com/mAmy9.png)

*With certain files like .AVI's you can set the download to “stream” and begin watching them as they download like Netflix does.*

**OH GAWD GIVE ME ACCESS!**

I consider this still in a bit of an alpha phase. I am willing to accept a few different friends who meet the following qualifications:

1. Are users who are technically competent and won't be asking me questions every step of the way.

2. Aren't assholes.

3. Willing to immediately take the effort to find someone trustworthy and friend them on the network. (The more friends you have, just choose carefully.)

These users can then allow other people to connect to them. Connecting to someone is as simple as downloading [this program](http://retroshare.sourceforge.net/downloads.html) and adding someone's public key. They must do the same to you. Be sure to use nopaste.com or something to share your keys

**IMPROTANT NOTES**


* When first creating an account, so just leave it blank.
* You **must** change your download and upload speeds to 99999, you will still remain anonymous.
* When you first download from someone
* Do not just dump your ""torrents"" folder! For gods sake rename the files so we can search for them properly!

~~Again, search for ""General Discussion"" under ""popular forums"".~~

**Due to the VAST amount of people who want access

**Post there if you want access

1320267491.0,ly4n1,9 (or so things) YOU JUST DON'T DO IN THE LIBRARY,,24,13,46,"hey guys.  i study in the biblioteca a lot and there are some things that people do in the libraries around campus and more specifically PCL that make my blood boil.

one. the moment you walk into pcl THE REVOLVING DOOR IS NOT A COMPETITION.  SLOW THE FUCK DOWN.

two. THE FUCKING ELEVATOR: need to get to the 1st or 3rd floor? yes. are you handicapped? no. okay so did you just finish a marathon or something? nope. TAKE THE MOTHERFUCKING STAIRS.

three.  floor selection: 

*if you're going to work in a group to study that's totally cool; go to the second floor commons or to the 5th floor.  BUT THIS DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN RUN AROUND LIKE AN ASSHAT AND PLAY MUSIC IT'S A LIBRARY FOR GOD'S SAKE.

*need some quiet time? why don't you go to the 1st, or 6th floor of the PCL or any of the quiet libraries on campus.  BUT IT'S A MF QUIET FLOOR THAT MEANS NO TALKING. NONE. THIS ALSO INCLUDES CELL PHONE USE. walking a little ways into the stacks does not cut it.  i can still hear you.  i'm sorry you have to pack your things and take them with you to somewhere you can talk but that's just how it is.

four. CELL PHONES: in addition to issues with cellular phone communications already mentioned

*for some phones

*NO MATTER HOW LOUD YOUR VIBRATE IS

*speakerphone is NEVER OKAY ANYWHERE.

five. food:  food is totally cool in the library as long as you clean up after yourself.  the only problem i have is when your food smells like ROTTEN FERMENTING POOP CORPSES. 

six. share the outlets.  pay it forward.  it might be a little awkward at first

seven. TALKING (CONTINUED): this one in all all caps TALKING ON A QUIET FLOOR IN ANOTHER LANGUAGE DOES NOT MAKE IT OKAY.  EVEN IF I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

eight. sleeping: the library, i am a quiet sleeper.  if you snore or talk in your sleep DON'T SLEEP ON A QUIET FLOOR JUST GO HOME.  it's sad how many times i've actually had this problem.

nine. headphones: if your music is audible to the people around you through your headphones

10sih. whispering: be aware of how quiet you actually are when whispering  do you really know how to whisper or are you just making more hissing noises than usual?  if completely necessary, write a note. geez.

anyone have anything to add??

**EDIT:** I just want anyone else who might read this to know that while these are things that actually bother me, but I stand by what I've written.  Just know you should take everything with a grain of salt.

It's a 2 bedroom, too, if you have a car.

About me:  I'm 4th year CS major (graduating May 2012) originally from Houston.  I have a job and am planning on taking 8 hours of classes over the summer, I play a lot of videogames (xbox and pc: I don't mind setting everything up in my room if that's a problem)...  Actually, I'm terrible with about me's, but I think I'm a pretty easy-to-live-with / easygoing person... if there's anything specific you'd like to know feel free to ask.

I'm planning on buying most of the common-area things (dishes, tables, etc), so you shouldn't need to worry about anything but possibly a bed (I may be able to get you a twin to use over the summer if you don't want to invest money in one right now) and anything else you think you'll need.

I'd like to, and based on reception to that pilot program I could scale up. Here are my thoughts:

* Start with a wooden box placed in a well-trafficked location
* Provide scraps of paper and a few pens
* Encourage thoughtful
* Related to the above
* Ask for the name/identity of the submitter
* On the web end (described below), and comment on submissions.

I'm planning to collect the kudos at the end of every week

Thoughts down the line:

* Facebook integration might help people from submitting annoying responses to entries posted online.
* No commercialization. Ever.
* I may have to jump through some official UT Policy hurdles (i.e. bend over and take it a few times to get this accepted) but I'm willing to put in the effort to read these aloud outside or post them physically somewhere.
