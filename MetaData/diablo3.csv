1337562175.0,twri4,How to Get to Whimsyshire (Secret Level)! [possible spoilers],darthnoid,459,94,118,"Hey guys!  Thought I'd type up a little guide how to get to the special land of happiness and rainbows since I just did it last night and had to go to a million different websites and places to figure out how to get all the pieces and parts.

You need several things:
1. Black Mushroom (Act I)
2. Liquid Rainbow (Act II)
3. Gibbering Gemstone (Act III)
4. Wirts Cowbell (Act II)
5. [Plans: Staff of Herding] (Act IV)
6. Leorics Shinbone (Act I)


Reminder: You can acquire these parts in any order.  The guide is written in a chronological order for simplicities sake.

Pro-Tip: Get some friends to do this with you. For the RNG parts

**From this point on

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Part One: Black Mushroom**

The black mushroom is located in Act I

My recommendation is to start the quest ""Return to Tristram"" on Normal.  

The following method is the one that I used to obtain the mushroom. Apparently you can find the mushroom on more than one layout as a rare spawn.  

Take the waypoint to the Cathedral garden, Leave game, and resume again.  Repeat until you see a large stair case.  When you find it will be in a room shaped like this with two entrances. http://img221.imageshack.us/img221/3761/mushroomlocation.png (I snagged the image from a random page, no screenshots are mine). The mushrooms are a random spawn in the correct dungeon so keep leaving and zoning in until you get the right setup and explore until you find that room.  Once you find THAT room, if it's empty leave and do it again you won't find it anywhere else.  It's impossible to miss when you see it, it looks like I giant growth in the floor.

ALTERNATE METHOD:

Repeatedly clear Level 1 of the Cathedral until you find the mushroom

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Part two: Leorics Shinbone**

The shinbone is located in Leorics manor.  I forget the quest name, the shinbone is a rare spawn in the fireplace.  It will either be empty or have a clickable ""burnt firewood"" or something to that affect.  Click it and loot your shinbone. You may have to repeat it several times as it also is not a guaranteed spawn.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Part three: Wirts Cowbell**

If you go to the last quest of Act III zone in and back track to the starting area. Go to the top left region of the map with the starting waypoint and look for a vendor named Squirt.  She will sell you Wirts Bell for 100k.  You can also get Wirts Cowbell from Squirt in Act II. She's in the market (near the sewer).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Part four: Liquid Rainbow**

Take the waypoint to Path of the Oasis.  Follow the map along the southern most border until you find a little path heading further south to a little clearing.  Look for Zaven the Alchemist

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Part five: Gibbering Gemstone**

Go to Act III, and bottom right corner of the map for Cave of Frost Level 1.  Again, the dungeon is a rare spawn.  Inside the dungeon on floor two, you may get a rare spawn creature named Chiltara.  It will drop the gemstone.  I'd recommend running this on normal running past everything until you get to the second floor, and fully exploring the second floor to find him.  Another rare spawn within a rare spawn type deal.  Happy RNG.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Part six: The damn Blacksmithing Pattern.**

Rare drop off of Izhual.  Start at the third quest.  Clear up to izhual


Once you get all these items. Train the blacksmith with your pattern

Take it to Act I. Take the old tristram waypoint and head to the left back to the Old Tristram Road (you must be on normal with this version of the staff).  If you follow the map border down the side of the map you will see a ghost come out of a cow skeleton. Talk to him and he will open the portal.  Have fun.

**Nightmare

In order to access Whimsyshire on a higher difficulty than normal you must first obtain the version of the staff as listed above.  Once you have it you must go to Act IV on the next highest difficulty (you must be on nightmare to obtain the nightmare blacksmithing plan). Take the waypoint to Basion Keep


 The only reagent for the new staves are the one you already have and a large quantity of gold. As reported, hell is 500k, and inferno is 1million.


Good luck guys

As for my copies

Also, please send me a private message with the subject D3 Guest Pass. I will try to get some to you as soon as possible. These are first come first serve.
************************************************


First, or any other retailers. 

I purchased a few extra copies of the game for some friends

I don't know how I would go about verifying that you pre-ordered it, so I would like to make this fair and not just first come first serve. Any idea how I can get this done in an organize manner?

Also I'll likely just give you the code for the game



***Edit: A picture of the pre-order receipt would definitely work. That's great!

As for figuring out who to give it to, D2, or even while waiting for D3. Then I can come back later today and pick the top rated stories. 

I would love to give you all a copy

***Edit: Someone brought up a good point that most of the orders may have just been a down payment and not a full purchase. I'm not asking for money

1340386791.0,vg0lq,New Hardkore Mode,havoK718,467,160,49,"My grandpa works at Blizzard and he told me that there will be a new HARDKORE mode to accommodate everyone who are complaining about how recent patches have made the game too easy. This mode is only for the most EXTREME of gamers. It's basically Diablo 3 version 1.0.0 with a few changes to make it good enough for all the extreme pro elitist gamers that just hate these damn FING CASUAAAALS that ""ruin my game"". These changes include:

**More vases

The amount of vases in the game has been quadrupled. Certain areas had too many ""monsters that fight back"" and were depopulated to make room for more vases. Areas without vases were removed from the game. Gamers now enjoy endgame content like vase smashing all day long without having to reload so often. 

Vases now have a chance to spawn as Rare and Champion Vases. These provide additional challenges for our elite players as they require an extra attack to destroy. The royal crypt has been modified to contain respawnable vases and exciting new events where you must destroy at least 500 vases in order to advance. The Skeleton King is replaced with Leoric's Pot of Gold

**Tyrael all the time**

The angel of justice will fight for you throughout the entire game

**More treasure goblins**

Elite players are complaining because they have to make so many new games at the ancient path to engage in the fun act of goblin farming

**Retro Balancing**

Sick of Blizzard nerfing your exploitable builds? Tired of IAS nerfs and other limits/readjustments that prevent you from easymoderolling through the game because all these FING CASUAAAAAALS were too poor to get IAS gear? No more! In this mode all the balancing will be reminiscent to Diablo II. You can stack enough IAS to attack twenty times a second, and of course you can have incredible movement speed allowing you to zip through an open field in less that 10 seconds, runewords that have a 50% chance to make the moon crash onto your foe every time they hit you, equips that grant stats like Crushing Blow that rip bosses to shreds in seconds, spammable potions that make it impossible to die, and so on. No more nerfed IAS, no more nerfed life leech

**Readjusting of item stats**

To match the playstyle of the most elite Diablo III gamers, crit bonus and primary stats. In addition, a few more hardkoar stats have been added:

   - Increased Vase Breaking Speed
   - Increased Respawn After Death Speed
   - +Damage Against Goblins
   - +Damage For Tyrael
   - % Better Chance of Finding Magical Items in Resplendent Chests
   - % Better Chance of Finding Magical Items on Goblins
   - % Extra Gold from Vases
   - Increased New Game Making Speed

**Character Customization is back**

People aren't all the same anymore! You now get points when you level up that you can put in whatever stat you want so the game doesn't force FING CASUAAAAAAAL stats such as Vitality onto you anymore. Oh but you cant just allocate them anywhere because weapons now have stat requirements that you must meet. Also once you set a skill

**Simplified Boss Farming**

Hardkore elite gamers were complaining that farming a boss was too complicated and all the Nephalem Valor business was the exact opposite of what they wanted. All this fun business that only caters to FING CASUAAAALS is removed. To make it even more efficient, bosses now have infinite hp and just sit there in a corner while the player bashes them like a pinata and loot is automatically sent to his stash.

**New Spells

The reasoning behind this is that certain abilities would be too hardcore for all the casual kids and their soccer mom schedules on the scrub servers

   - **New Spell: Elite Shout** This Spell Increases Tyrael's damage by 50%, cooldown of 30 seconds.

   - **Runes:**
       - Loot Time - Also increases your Gold Find and Magic Find by 30%
       - Power of Justice - When Tyrael kills an enemy
       - Angelic Shout - When Tyrael crits
       - Wrath of the Angels - Tyrael now uses the Whirlwind spell
       - Holy Destruction - Automatically breaks all vases within 50 yards of Tyrael

   - **New Runes for old Barbarian Spells:**
       - Whirlwind / Vase Destruction - Vases you destroy with whirlwind drop twice as much gold and you also generate 5 fury for each vase destroyed
       - Frenzy / Gold Rush - Additional to the extra IAS you also get 10% extra gold find to each stack
       - Ancient Spear / Goblin Harpoon - If you use it on a goblin
       - Ignore Pain / Ignore Elite - All the elites disappear when you use this spell so you can rush straight to the boss
       - Overpower / Overpowered - adds a 10% chance to cast Mind Blast when struck

   - **New Passive Spells for Barbarians:**
       - Treasure Hunt - Increases the chances of finding a goblin
       - Vacism - Your attacks automatically smash vases nearby
       - Vase Looting - +50 yards to gold pickup radius
       - Vasectomy - Doubles the speed at which the Barbarian kicks vases

At the conclusion of the Sin Wars, and the Prime Evils with drew from Sanctuary (I have a feeling that a corrupted Inarius will be a boss in Diablo III at one point or another since he has not appeared in Diablo I or II).  Of course Diablo, Mephisto and Baal and did not keep their end of the promise, and would continue to influence and recruit humans to do their bidding.  Against the will of the other council members, Tyrael, the Archangel of Justice would intervene and help the humans fight against the demons of hell as they slowly invaded the mortal world.

The lesser evils thought that the three Prime Evils meddling in human affairs was detracting from the great conflict against the Heavens.  Their hatred for the heavens was immense and their hatred for the Prime Evils grew stronger and stronger with each new incident with the humans. Eventually they banded together and revolted.  The 4 lesser evils are:

•	[Duriel - Lord/Prince of Pain](http://i.imgur.com/ALESN.jpg)   
•	[Andariel - Maiden of Anguish](http://i.imgur.com/Eb3Kq.jpg)  
•	[Azmodan - Lord of Sin](http://i.imgur.com/VyeHj.jpg)  
•	[Belial - Lord of Lies](http://i.imgur.com/hA0Zs.jpg)

Their revolution was successful and the 3 Prime Evils were banished from hell.  This was known as the Dark Exile.  The Prime Evils were forced to walk the land of the living, and Mephisto’s was Mefis.  They made up the 3 pillars of the Triune Cult, led by the Primus (Grand Priest) who was Mephisto’s son, Lucion, in disguise.   The cult’s symbol was a triangle, with each point of the triangle being one of the 3 Prime Evils.  The Triune cult had temples throughout the land of Sanctuary where they recruited naïve humans and corrupted their souls.

To stop the Prime Evils spread of chaos and destruction, Jered Cain and our beloved Deckard Cain.  The Horadrim was made up of 3 major mage clans, and each clan was tasked with defeating one of the 3 Prime Evils.  Tyrael gave the Horadrim 3 soulstones, magical artifacts that was capable of imprisoning powerful beings such as the Prime Evils.  

The first to be captured and imprisoned was Mephisto, the middle brother.  His capture was much harder, and led the Horadrim to chase him all the way to the Northern Desserts of Lut Gholein (You travel here in Diablo II - Act 2 to kill Baal, but that doesn't turns out as planned.  I'll go into it more when we get to the Diablo II section).   During the fight in the dessert, Baal was able to shatter the soulstone when they attempted to imprison him.  Eventually Baal was subdued by Tal Rasha, one of the most powerful mages.  In an attempt to seal Baal without a soulstone, Tal Rasha impaled the largest shard of the soulstone into his chest, thus dooming his own fate.  He would then wrestle with the demon within him for all eternity as his students sealed him in a secret tomb in the desert (Canyon of the Magi).  As the sand shifted and time passed

The last to be captured was Diablo, fighting the terror that he would unleash on the land.  They eventually tracked him all the way west, to Khanduras.  After a devastating battle, Diablo was sealed in the soulstone deep within the cave system underneath Khanduras.  They built a monastery on top to guard the location and entrance, but as time passed, the last of the Horadrim died and faded away.  Eventually, the monastery fell to ruins. Only one Horadrim remains, underneath Khanduras that Diablo remains trapped for two centuries.  

It was around this time, and we now dive into the events of the Diablo I game.

###Diablo I

As the soulstone became more corrupt over time, causing his loyal knights to lose faith in their king.  

Diablo wanted to possess King Leoric himself because he needed a physical body, Prince Albrecht into the catacombs underneath the cathedral and possessed him instead.  Diablo (it was Lazarus who really did it, but he was under Diablo's control so technically, it was Diablo) inserted the soulstone into Prince Albrecht's forehead, and gain mortal form.  The king accused the townspeople's of his son's disappearance, and had many executed.  Eventually, the king's knights were forced to slain him as his madness grew daily and more people were being executed.

Countless people were being lured into the catacombs and being slaughtered by ""The Butcher"" as well.  These sacrifices allowed Diablo to summon countless demons into the catacombs and they spread to the countryside attacking farmers.  As rumors of the demons spread through out the land, the player.  You eventually un-cover the true cause and ventured into the catacombs to fight the butcher. The unnamed hero descends through sixteen levels of the labyrinth before encountering and killing Diablo.  

After defeating Diablo, the unnamed hero plunged the soulstone into his own forehead.  With all his will power and might, the unnamed hero fought to contain Diablo within his own body.  He travels aimlessly through out the land, but always East for some reason.  Perhaps it is Diablo's doing (it is), or perhaps he is seeking powerful mages in the Far East to help him sub due Diablo's soul once and for all.  This unnamed hero will become the [Dark Wanderer]( http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs47/f/2009/223/9/8/The_Dark_Wanderer_by_DefiledVisions.jpg) that we run into in Diablo 2.  

Well that wraps up Diablo I and the prologue.  I'll start on Diablo 2 when I can find some time.  Let me know if you have any questions

**TL;DR - There was an evil gang and the 4 smaller dudes wasn't happy with the 3 bigger thugs

Edit: It has been revealed by those lucky enough to be part of the closed beta that Blizzard has ret-conned (or perhaps just provided more information) some stuff in Diablo I.  SPOILER ALTER! SPOILER ALERT! STOP! HALT! Do not read on unless you want information from D3's story.  The two biggest pieces of info are that the unnamed hero who was the player, he had bear a child with a women named Adria.  He left before the child was born, and never got to see his beautiful daughter, Leah (DUN DUN DUN!).  Thank you to [DisRuptive1](http://www.reddit.com/r/diablo3/comments/sr5yj/the_story_continues_prolog_and_events_of_diablo_i/c4gc6ug) for providing me this information.

There are two main ways to make a game more difficult, so it requires more skill to play the game properly, it requires work, but makes for fun gameplay and a sense of achievement, this is the method which WoW used to an extent, deadmines was less complex than molten core.

The second way is by numbers, it's obviously going to be harder to kill them, hence the game will be harder, this is lazy design and is usually applied to grindfests, for example, disgaea.

Then what is the problem with Inferno? as I see it, and it's no fun dealing with it, encountering a group which pulls you to them and then instakills you isn't fun, getting snared and killed without any chance of survival isn't fun, getting walls around you so you are cornered and trying to kill everyone before they oneshot you without any success isn't fun.

Is it hard? sure it is

EDIT: For some reason, mad, crying over the matter or similar, I'd appreciate it if there was any arguing along with that, I'd also like to point out that I'm barely capable of giving a single fuck about myself being able to beat inferno or not, this is just my take on the matter and the dicussion about it.",,self,,

Hello everyone, I will try and use a spoiler tag.  With that said, let just dive into the events and fascinating twists and turns of Diablo 2, and hopefully, ~~the Lord of Destruction expansion pack!~~ It got way too long, so I will be breaking that off into another post. The post was too long to all fit in the header, please check the comments for Act III and IV (I know asking for upvotes of any kind is wrong, so I don't get any sort of Krama

###Prologue
    
At the end of Diablo I, King Leoric’s eldest son, ** ***END SPOILER*** ** had become the Dark Wanderer.  He impaled the soulstone into his forehead and carried Diablo’s spirit within him.  He struggled with the demon and fought to control his own body, but Diablo was too strong and quickly corrupted our hero.  

*“Many moons have passed since I left the town of Tristram behind me. Since then I've tried to forget the terrors I beheld beneath the cold earth, assuring me that my salvation lies within the ruins of ancient kingdoms. Though I know the way, I know not what perils will arise to hinder my journey, and as I pass through the first gate, I know that the better part of my soul will remain behind… forever.”*

###Opening Cinematic

The [opening cinematic for Diablo II]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0kPXdtz_c4) introduces us to Marius, except Marius.  He is spared once again.  Compelled by Diablo’s calling, Marius followed the Dark Wanderer as he travels further East.

*""Why did I follow him...? I don't know. Why do things happen as they do in dreams? All I know is that, East. Always... into the East.""*

###Act I – The Sightless Eye

We are then taken in game and pick one of the 5 heroes to play as.  The story goes that the heroes traveled as a group, a camp made by the survivors of the Rogue Monastery on the outskirts of Khanduras.  The heroes are tasked with clearing out the evils in the surrounding area and to save the last Horadrim, Deckard Cain (yayyyyy).  The passage through the Rogue Monastery must be cleared before we can travel east, as this is the only passage through the mountains.  However, it is currently being guarded by [Andariel , the Maiden of Anguish](http://i.imgur.com/Eb3Kq.jpg).  She was put here to guard the passage and keep anyone from following Diablo.  Andariel is defeated after traversing through the Monastery halls clearing out the countless demons, and we continue onward

###Act II – The Secret of the Vizjerei

We reach Lut Gholein and realize that this city too, killing and taking what they find.  After clearing out the sewers, the heroes consult with Lord of Lut Gholein and his Wizard Drognan to conclude that the Dark Wanderer is really Diablo and he is seeking the long lost Tomb of Tal Rasha, somewhere in the desert.  

[Diablo seeks to free his brother, the Horadric Staff must be reassembled, as this is the key to chamber in which Baal has laid dormant for over two centuries.  The heroes search the endless desert to reassemble the staff, and ventures into the Arcane Sanctuary, an ethereal realm, to find the where about of Tal Rasha’s Tomb.   After defeating [The Summoner]( http://diablo.wikia.com/wiki/The_Summoner) and finding Horazon’s Journal,  it is revealed that the tomb is concealed in the Canyon of The Magi.  

The heroes rushed to the tomb with urgency to stop Diablo from freeing Baal, [Duriel, the Lord/Prince of Pain](http://i.imgur.com/ALESN.jpg).  His icy attacks chilled our heroes to the bone, but by this point, they had grown strong (with some epic loot and rare magic find (OP as shit right?)).   After Duriel is defeated, the heroes enter Baal chamber to find Tyrael constrained by chains that once held the now cunning and sly Baal (it is said that when Tal Rasha plunged the soulstone into his chest and imprisoned Baal within him, he passed onto Baal all his intellect and knowledge).  The heroes free Tyrael as he reveals [what had happened merely days before]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdgwRT5dLt8).  The Dark Wanderer and his follower Marius had entered the tomb to free Baal.  Tryrael descended from the Heavens to stop Diablo, Marius was drawn to Baal, Marius fed the tomb with Baal’s soulstone fragment and headed toward the Temple of Light.  Now alone, Mephisto

""Well I have to applaud Blizzard in all reality. From a business stand point it would seem like you're on the perfect track to make the shareholders at Activision very

You've taken a game with so much hype built around it

I understand that WoW is dying. The cash cow that you have been able to depend on to fill your coffers is finally drying up. It had a great run. MoP is not likely to defibrillate the failing heart of what was once the WoW empire, cannot replace this cash cow - then again it wasn't meant to. How could it? Your business foresight is very, very attuned. Because of this you carefully planned your next chess move: Diablo 3.

What better way to birth another golden goose than to bank an entire game off of the most addictive part of what Diablo 2 was: the item grind. Pure brilliance. And so

Except one thing: you're boring.

On May 15th 2012, it's not quite Diablo 3. It's a slimmed down, cut up version of the Diablo 3 everyone was taught to expect. Except, it wasn't given to us, we still had to pay you full price for it: $60.

My how the mighty hath fallen. Why is it not Diablo 3

From nearly FOUR years ago:

@2:10 ""These current weapons just won't do!"":

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K0YkUH6r6c&amp;list=UUCGf0PicJgNp6yb7xsdZAwA&amp;index=1&amp;feature=plcp

I guess scrapping this idea all together was more developmentally cost effective.

@6:30 ""Let's see what a real fight looks like.""

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT4K6e2q10g&amp;list=UUCGf0PicJgNp6yb7xsdZAwA&amp;index=10&amp;feature=plcp

Indeed

@2:00 Did he say randomized

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMAyxY7mjzI&amp;list=UUCGf0PicJgNp6yb7xsdZAwA&amp;index=7&amp;feature=plcp

If their idea of newly generated fights

So where's the beef? - some might say. The beef is that this is not Diablo 3

That leaves myself and thousands of others saying indeed

Is anyone still in complete denial about how truly boring this game is or have people started to shake off the honey moon dust?

You eliminated enchanting, and that is my fault. I wrongly assumed this group was made of trend setters and leaders, not followers - so shame on me.)

You didn't include a single player mode because you can't make money off of people if they aren't using the AH in a multiplayer format. Less work for you in the development stages

There is so LITTLE dynamic to this game I cannot believe it took this many years to create it. In fact

More specifically, took years to iron out - while the game itself probably took no more than a few actual working years to complete (and it truly shows).

It doesn't take an overly intelligent mind to figure WHY they would want to use a RMAH and get a cut of (a lot of) the transactions. That's fine. Here's the problem: you built the entire game around a pure gear grind, you're not building a great game - and a great game this is not.

In conclusion, eat your heart out. You'll find no better place to do it! If not, there are a plethora of other games out there much more deserving of your $60, I promise.

Diablo 3 was built around Activision's greed. Participate at your own will.

Gamers hold grudges and people aren't going to forget this disaster. If you obliterate your true fan base

I give this post less than a few hours before it is deleted by Blizzard moderators. Can't have that bad flavor out there

I was a little mad when I logged into my wizard only to find my DPS cut in half. Matters were made even worse when I tried to continue my run through act II. If you have any gear that is sub par, claimed the gold from my auction and repaired all my items (spending all my gold) back to broke. 

Now, and another 10-15 in the vault. it ended being over 35 rares in the span of under 2 hours. The best part: I spent 25k total on repairs (Worth it!). Time for an identification party!

The bottom line is blizzard has a lot of work to do with this game. Patch 1.0.3 was the first step in the right direction. They made the game wayyyy more fun to play. No more dark/dank cellar farming runs. No more treasure goblin runs. BTW we encountered 3 goblins during our run. 

Ill probably get downvoted to shit for the readability of this post. I dont care. I just wanted to get the word out. This subreddit should be more about discussing the game. Not hating on blizzard.

There are basically three worlds in the Diablo Universe, and the mortal world known as Sanctuary.  In the beginning, Sanctuary did not exist and neither did humans.  There was only the High Heavens and Burning Hell.  The two worlds battled each other endlessly for control in what is known as the Great/Eternal Conflict.  This war has lasted since the beginning of creation, and while each side would gain the advantage every now and then, it has pretty much been a stalemate.   


The burning hell was lead by the three Prime Evils

•	[Tyrael - The Archangel of Justice (Male)](http://i.imgur.com/uN76t.jpg)   
•	[Auriel - The Archangel of Hope (Female)](http://i.imgur.com/izYCc.jpg)  
•	[Malthael – The Archangel of Wisdom (Male)](http://i.imgur.com/DQHx0.jpg)  
•	[Imperius – The Archangel of Valor (Male)](http://i.imgur.com/N9m3A.jpg)  
•	[Itherael – The Archangel of Fate (Sexless


There was one more powerful Archangel that acted as an advisor to the Angiris Council, Inarius hid the presence of Sanctuary from Heaven and Hell.    


Humans were the off springs of Angels and Demons that lived in Sanctuary and were very powerful at first.  The first generations of humans were known as Nephalem, draining them of their innate powers.  He wanted humans to worship him, and created a relgion/cult called the Cathedral of Light.  The Prime Evils were the first to discovered Sanctuary, and attempted to gain influence over the population and recruit them as soldiers in the Great Conflict.  Not wanting to alert the high heavens of Sanctuary's existence, they formed a religion/cult called the Triune.  Both religion recruited followers and used them for their own purpose.   


A lot more happens before the events of the first Diablo, Uldyssian tapped into the Worldstone and unleashed his tremendous power, so great in fact that it was going to destroy all of Sanctuary.  Once he realized this, he sacrificed himself to save the mortal world.  This is when the Agiris Council discovered Sanctuary and what Inarius has done.  They descended into Sanctuary and were going to destroy it since they viewed it as an abomination tainted with demon blood.  After all, humans were half demon as they were the off spring of Angels and Demons.    


Of the 5 in the Agiris Council, the Archangel of Wisdom abstaining from voting.  Tyrael, the last to vote, was originally disgusted by the tainted humans and wanted to destroy it.  If he had voted yes, the tie would have doomed Sanctuary for destruction.  However, after seeing Uldyssian’s sacrifice, he voted no and Sanctuary was spare.  Tyreal was so impressed by Uldyssian’s act because Uldyssian had basically become all powerful.  He would have been a god, and it moved Tyrael.  This made Tyrael see the good in mankind


This wraps up the pre-diablo I history.  If you guys like this, and there is plenty of stuff out on the web as well to read through if you want to do your own research.  Leave me any questions you have and I’ll try and answer them as best as I can.  

**TL:DR - The moral world

Edit:  There seems to be a genuine interest in the rest of the lore.  I wrote up everything up to and including Diablo I and will post it shortly.  Although [Crackensan did a quick summary](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/sqhuw/the_story_so_fara_recount_of_what_has_happened/c4g5wvc) of most of the events already leading all the way up to Diablo 3 so it's a great summary.

1348503152.0,10ebu1,BEST diablo 3 farming route explained. (Plus epic Skorn),turbogoblin,221,49,151,"I have been running with a lot of people lately, and GF bonuses will be worth the challenge I'm sure.

All of the people I run with are unfamiliar with my route

Anyway

1. Set quest to Kill Azmodan.

2. If this is your first time through the run start at the core of arreat and work your way through to the check point right before Azmodan. DO NOT KILL Azmodan. Simply port back to town and continue the run.

If this is not your first time through the run you will start at the checkpoint right before Azmodan. Work your way backwards through the core of arreat to the waypoint.

3. Port to The Tower of the Damned lvl 1. Complete a full circle here and then use the same waypoint to port to the Keep Depths 3.

3. Clear the Keep Depths 3 (usually 2-3 packs

4. Clear the Keep Depths 2. There will be a lot of packs here. Usually 5 or 6, port back to town. 

5. Take the waypoint to the Arreat Crater lvl 2. Clear the crater all the way to the entrance of the Tower. Port back to town.

6. Take the waypoint to The Bridge of Korsikk. Clear the Fields of Slaughter, lacuni, and those big bull type things...not very fun)

This is generally where my run ends. However, when I'm really close to leveling, or if I want a change of pace. 

Optional areas are:

1. Rakkis crossing, always contains only 1 pack, and sometimes has a goblin in it. After you have finished the Underbridge go back to the Rakkis crossing waypoint and head south until you meet The Fields of Slaughter. 

2. Stonefort. This is not the most efficient area in terms of monster and pack density

I don't generally bother with The Arreat Crater lvl 1, it's a waste of time in my opinion.

The name of the game here is efficiency. If you have to re-spec to slightly lower DPS for greater survivability, running back to where you died takes a lot of time that you could be spending killing elite packs. 

This run yields on average 10 million XP.

I can complete this run with 0 deaths in around 18-20 minutes depending on how many packs I run into. This generally equates to about 30 million XP per hour. When I first started doing this run

I should add

Try to get as close to movement speed cap as you can. I run with 24% move speed from Inna's Pants and Nat's Boots. The move speed alone can cut your run time by a couple of minutes.

TL;DR:

1. Core of arreat

2. Tower of the Damned lvl 1

3. Keep Depths 3

4. Keep Depths 2

5. Arreat Crater lvl 2

6. Bridge of Korsikk (Fields of Slaughter)

Move fast

Oh

Hi all


I'd like to share with you all the data I've collected throughout my journey of raising my Gold Find % and farming my life away. 


I'm a Demon Hunter and I've been using The Royal Crypts area to farm. (Inferno

I currently make ~420k per hour with 262% Gold Find. To buy any more gold find gear would be extremely inefficient as I'll explain later. 


**Gearing Up**


To start off,000 or cheaper on the AH.  This got me up to 110% to start with using only ~160k. I then started farming and purchased upgrades as I went along. I'd try to find pieces close to 20-25% for 160k. I also got lucky and found a 29% GF amulet on one of my runs.


**Gold Find to Gold per Hour stats**

Whenever I upgraded to a higher GF%


* 110% - 255
* 196% - 287
* 209% - 317
* 225% - 354
* 240% - 392
* 262% - 420

All of this was over the span of about 3 days


My original goal was to get to ~310% so I could make 500k/hr. However, as it would take me 50 hours of farming just to break even on upgrades from this point alone. 


That's about all the information I recorded in the process. I hope this is interesting to some people. :)


**EDIT: [Video showing the route](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQDQ1JAPE0)**




**EDIT2: After upgrading my GF by 6% and radius by 12


**EDIT3: For people adding me just to ask how much I'm making now

GF%: 302

Pickup Radius: 31

Movement Speed: 12%

Clear time: 45 seconds (average)

Gold per Hour: 750k




**I'm going to be putting together a comprehensive Gold Find guide over the next couple weeks which will include all of my experiments and data. I'd like to cover all classes and farming builds for them as well

Hello everyone

###Opening Cinematic

At the end of Diablo II, the last remaining Prime Evil has assembled a massive army and is now making [his assault on Mt. Arreat]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQ7KgW_yi3E&amp;feature=relmfu), home of the courageous barbarian tribes.  These [barbarian tribes](http://i.imgur.com/NButc.jpg) lived for the glory of battle, and were considered to be some of the fiercest warriors Sanctuary had to offer.  This is why they were tasked with the important role of guarding Mount Arreat, home of the converted Worldstone.  

###Diablo II: Lord of Destruction – Act V

Tyrael opens a portal for our heroes to the barbarian city of [Harrogath, now lies in ruins.  Harrogath is the last Barbarian stronghold, and is currently under siege by Baal’s Army.  Many brave barbarians have died to defend the fortress, and many more die each day as the siege continues.  Shenk the Overseer, Baal’s most decorated general, is leading the siege against Harrogath.  

If not for the Druid “Spell of Warding”, received word that Baal’s army was coming and that many of their brethrens had failed to deter his ungodly army.  In a courageous act of selflessness and courage, they sacrificed their lives to cast the “Spell of Warding”, a warding spell that would par passage to any hell spawn, including the Lord of Destruction himself.  Only one person survived the casting of the spell, Nihlathak, who struggles daily with the guilt of being spared and the grief of his lost companions. While the spell has worked so far, the Barbarians fought on without a hint of uncertainty.  

##Siege of Harrogath

Fearing the worst however, the [Assassin](http://diablo.wikia.com/wiki/Assassin) and the [Druid](http://diablo.wikia.com/wiki/Druid).  This brings us up to a total of 7 heroes).  While the barbarians joined the heroes on the battlefield, they did not see them as equals, but rather as a mere distraction for the demons as the barbarians were the real warriors.  This attitude quickly changed as the barbarians’ bear witness to the ferocity that the heroes employed on the front lines.  The holy paladin, zealous in his attacks, brought justice down upon the demons spawn with his hammer over and over again.  Bolts of lightning and thunder ripped through the sky, while raging hydras of fire roared from the very bowels of earth, commander of nature’s elements.  At times, down the slopes of Mount Arreat, and Baal’s advance towards the Worldstone came to a sudden and jolting end.  Or so it seems…

##Prison of Ice

Unbeknownst to the Barbarian tribes and the heroes, pondered endlessly on what they could have done differently.  He concluded that there was only one way, and stuck a deal with the Lord of Destruction.  In return for Harrogath’s safety, Nihlathak will give Baal the Relic of the Ancients.  This holy totem allowed anyone who possesses it to bypass the Rite of Passage at the summit of Mount Arreat, and be granted access to the chamber of the Worldstone.   With the holy totem in hand, Baal and his army proceeded to the inner chambers of Mount Arreat, known as the Worldstone Keep. 

No one knew that this had happened, uncovers Nihlathak’s plan.  To avoid his secrete from being reveal, Nihlathak kidnapped Anya and imprisoned her in the icy caves of the Crystalline Passage.  It is not until the heroes rescued Anya that is information is revealed (The quest to kill Nihlathak, Betrayal of Harrogath, becomes available at this point, but it is optional).  ",,self,,

With that being said the story is as follows; Cro paid me 1000 euro on the 20th for the amulet and 1500 euro for the ring on the 21st of june. The following day on the 22nd this money was blocked by paypal due possible unauthorized usage of a creditcard, Paypal requires full names of the buyer and seller to keep proper documentation of trades. 

On the 6th of July the money was released by paypal in the afternoon, they said it could take 1-3 days but if he would link the card that he used to his new account it would be available within a day. Also they 100% guaranteed me that he would have received a message in his paypals mail about the money being refunded, which many of us paypal users could confirm from experience.

With all this being said Cro was unbelievable hard to reach after the refund took place

1369003344.0,1enooe,A guide to the AH and how you can make millions,bloozntooz,128,29,37,"[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/diablo3/comments/1emias/tip_if_you_are_new_to_inferno_and_are_looking_at/) thread inspired me to make a guide for you guys. I didn't realize how difficult it was for some people to just work basic parts of the AH which probably explains why a lot of you hate having to use it. So here are a few methods and tips on how to make money + snipe gear for your guys at super low prices.  


With this guide you will basically learn how the basics of how to snipe items and sell them for an insane profit. I like to use legendary items for this because its easier. If you know how to trade feel free to use rares.  
 
[\(ScreenShot1\) ](http://imgur.com/LjO6JL0)   
The recommended items is a great spot to start out looking for gear.
Your currently selected hero will determine what gear you see here.
Look at my buyout buttons arrow, the most expensive items will start your list. I'm not a fan of a hundred million gold on anything so I usually keep the arrow facing up.

**Now lets get started**  
**Get your search preferences setup **  
 1. Equipment search (Set it to Barbarian)*(This may vary)*   
 2. Armor *(Generally selling armor makes me money far faster then selling weapons)*  
3.Set rarity to Legendary   

**Your Screen should now look similar to mine**  
[\(Screenshot 2\)](http://imgur.com/J5oOchQ) 

**Now what?**  

Good question
*Sometimes* this method requires more time to sell items but the return on them can be freakin' huge and totally worth giving up an auction slot for a day.  

1. [Check out this most popular items list](http://diablo.somepage.com/popular/items)

**Here is an example of why it is so important to know your items and the stats they can spawn with.**  
Let's use Inna's Temperance as the example item here. It is a very popular item and over the days I've seen the prices on it vary quite a bit. When I first started looking at it
noticed that as well seeing as how it's flooded with these and the price has dropped by almost 50%.   

[\(Screenshot 3\)](http://imgur.com/rMwpDOn)  

Remember when I said the right stats will make you more gold? Well a few days ago I missed an Inna's Temperance for 200k which had 90 Strength on it. The moment I realized that was worth a ton
I tried to buy it but poof it was gone

[\(Screenshot4\) ](http://imgur.com/44jInDh) 

Keep going through the list of popuar items for each class

**I didn't find any good deals for the popular items what should I do?**  
2. Try out my next favorite method. With the same search settings as I stated above:    
Instead of typing in a specific item and checking its prices
**I recommend this over method 1 to anyone who doesn't have a lot of gold to invest. Don't worry that will change soon though!**  

Okay so you have your search settings all set up and you have your buyout arrow pointing up so you see the cheapest items.  
Your screen should look similar to this.  
[\(Screenshot5\)](http://imgur.com/j63ALjj)    

Look for any items here that are selling for 2500-5000 a nice tip is that if you see the same items over and over and over again
they aren't worth buying. I see those same belts every single day at the same prices
 
**Scroll through the market
For example look at this Giant Skull
[\(Screenshot6\)](http://imgur.com/8m96BrS)   
**Lets check the market to see if that would be a good buy.**  

[\(ScreenShot7\)](http://imgur.com/j7LkNDI)  
Sure is! What a snipe! It's not the biggest profit but hey man it's a start!  The next cheapest Giant Skull was 19k gold.  

Now here is another fork in the road  
**1. Do you want to sell this item as a quick profit of probably 11k gold?**   
*OR*  
**2. Did it happen to have good stats and is potentially worth billions?**  

Lets hope for #2 as we search the market.  

Go back to your stash and look at that beautiful item you sniped for next to nothing.  
136 strength and 23 Intelligence? Might not be the best stats
Go back to the Search tab and search for a giant skull with Preferred Stats of 130 str  
What do you know a 130+ str giant skull sells for a lot of gold!  
**(I didn't get a screenshot but it was 350k for the cheapest.)**  

**Well now what do I do? Should I sell it for 300k gold?**
Let's think about this for a minute
*We're doing this to find out if its worth selling a Giant Skull for such a high price
**So lets go back to our search tab and compare**  

I'm setting the Level cap to 52 (Giant Skull level) and setting the rarity to ALL. Because it is a high str item and basically only barbs will want STR I will leave the ""Barbarian"" setting alone.  
Here is a picture of my search settings  
[\(Screenshot8\)](http://imgur.com/QpHNAKQ)  


**Now take a look at those search results.**  
As you can see the average helm with this much str sells for at minimum 350k  
[\(Screenshot9\)](http://imgur.com/pLA7Tox)  

**Lets get more specific what happens if I add the ""Has Sockets"" to stats?**  
Well look at that
[\(Screenshot10\)](http://imgur.com/tk8RdEw) 

 See that giant skull for 50k? It really screws up the market
[\(Screenshot11\)](http://imgur.com/QpHNAKQ)  

Why would I be nervous? Well

Here is another fork in the road and it's a risky one that has potential to pay off huge.    

**1. Should I buy that other Giant Skull for 50k and set a new market price?**  
*OR*  
**2. Should I try to sell MY Giant Skull for 42k and hope it sells before that one?**  

Well I'm gonna say screw it and buy his Giant Skull as well.* I want to essentially elimiante my competor so people think my helm is the cheapest on the market.*  
Plus if this works I'm going to make a killing all because I was patient.  

Let's go back to see what these stat Giant Skulls are worth again.
At minimum 350k  
[\(Screenshot12\)](http://imgur.com/Ugttvfy)  

Well the Giant Skull I paid 50k for has worse stats than the one I paid 8k for. So I'm going to try to sell it faster at a lower price.  
**The sad part is the Giant Skull for 350k has 39 vit.**  
For a barb (*Which is who we will be selling this to*) a helm with STR + VIT is very important. So I can't really compete with that.  


**Now I have to price this helm around that guys Giant Skull.**
*Would someone pay 50k less for a helm without vit?*  
If you are shopping for a 300k gold helm
I'd say 75k-100k cheaper would personally make me consider taking the cheaper helm.  
My better Giant Skull will be posted for 245k  
I'll put the one I bought for 50k up for 225k  

**Are these going to sell at that price?**  
Honestly man it's possible
I just personally haven't been playing long enough to know if this is an item that people use frequently.  
I may have to knock 75k-100k off the prices to get a sale but it will happen eventually. If you truly want to get rid of the item you could
sell the Giant Skull you purchased for 8k and sell it for 20k and move on with your life.   


Turns out that 50k Giant Skull is a Legacy item as well. I've hit it big with legacy items before. See below for an example. Wanderlust is a legacy item I sniped.

**The third and last method of the way I trade!**  
It's essentially the same as method 2

Go back to your original search settings  
[\(Screenshot13\)](http://imgur.com/qFBn4An)  

**Sometimes doing an overall search of EVERY item isn't the best way to find a great buy.**  

1. Click the **""All Armor Item Types""** tab and look at the drop down menu.  

[\(Screenshot14\)](http://imgur.com/59Xb9C9)  

2. Don't be like Drake

3. Click search and look at what pops up  
[\(Screenshot14\)](http://imgur.com/3qIKqXk)  

By narrowing it down to just Amulets you can see some awesome deals. Look at Traveler's Pledge
[\(Screenshot15\)](http://imgur.com/DXQiTS0)
**Yes! That is an excellent buy

[\(Screenshot16\)](http://imgur.com/evdedpf)  
**While taking screenshots and typing this stuff out

Keep repeating steps 1-3 for each category and hopefully you will find a good item worth selling. **Don't forget to skim the pages! Sometimes you can find an item for 200

**Here are some examples of awesome trades I made with these methods:**  
[Example1](http://imgur.com/5vNmMv4)  
[Example2](http://imgur.com/oyrmO44)  
[Example3](http://imgur.com/g7vI3cc)




**Questions/Concerns:**  
**""I have far more gold then you bloozntooz these methods aren't worth my time!""**  
That's cool man

**Why waste my time on this when I could just spend $4 and be worth 100mill?**    
Some people don't want to spend real money. Don't complain that there is nothing left to do in the game when you took the easy route to wealth. Getting rich by putting in a ton of work was the best part of d2 for me.  

**I'm not finding good items on the auction house. How am I supposed to profit?**  
The cool part of these methods is that you don't need to find a ""good"" item on the auction house. You just need to find an item worth more than you paid. If you spend 5000 gold on an item worth 30k

**I have more questions/can you explain something further?**

I can't afford to spend the real money it would take to buy the items that would help me get through inferno. And, and were just scrapped for mats.

Since the gold sale patch, they can buy a page 1 or 2 item?

Since this change I have gone from being able to afford the challenge of playing inferno, even considering the shitty drops I get. It wasn't awesome but it was good enough and fun. An actual challenge.

Now

It became very apparent this week as to what Blizzard's intentions likely are with inferno. Inferno is where they make their money. It struck me as odd early on how easy it was to level. If you know what you are doing

Maybe I am just whining

The rest of the game is fun enough to keep playing, unless something changes, I think I will put D3 away and finally write Blizzard off as another great company, finally ruined by money men and women.

**TL:DR** Money does not equal skill in gaming. Take your fake money buying and your AH and shove it

**Edit:** A couple things to clear up some confusion. When I am talking about the AH, and the problems I am seeing line up exactly with the advent of being able to purchase gold. So, to be clear, I am talking about the very recent addition of being able to buy in game gold, and the affects this has had on the Gold AH. In essence there is no longer a Gold AH, but just a RM AH. Because the effects of RM are now end to end in the system.

Also, I was making progress fine. And a lot less people were bitching as well.

a) Diablo 2 items were [bought and sold online all the time](http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=diablo+2+items+buy+online).  This wasn't something Blizzard came up with, no assurances that you would actually get the item, etc, etc.

b) The concept of [desire lines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path) or desire paths -- these are indicators of how people *actually are* doing something

In creating D3

Do they make money from it?  Sure.  They're still a business, etc.  There's nothing wrong with making money^1.

But Blizzard didn't just pull the idea of the RMAH out of their ass as a way to make cash -- they looked at how the long term customers were playing Diablo 2

If that's not for you, it's still been less than 30 days, you can still get a refund.  

Just don't pretend you're coming up with some deep
