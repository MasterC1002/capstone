1335651603.0,sxcpq,A belated thank you,OvarianCamper,64,4,10,"I just thought of doing this after participating in a ""Why does everyone hate the Yankees?"" forum.  I remembered a recent visit to Yankees stadium in my Rangers gear and the death threats I received (I'm still alive

But last year I visited Philly when the Rangers were in town and I had heard so many horror stories that part of me didn't want to wear my Rangers gear. Especially since my son was with me.  But he refused to go to the game without his Michael Young jersey on so we sported them both; and wouldn't you know I ended up having a really nice conversation with the group of people behind us about baseball (""Were you expecting us to stab you?"") on the first night

So...the point of the post is a belated thank you for showing my son and I a good time last year and proving that Philly fans aren't as ...graphic... as rumors had led me to believe. 

edit: also the stadium is gorgeous.  And when we walked in someone asked if it was my son's first game,,False,self,t5_2qjl8,True,,True

So 2 weeks ago I took a trip to Philly with my brother. After grabbing a roast pork sandwich from the reading market we headed out to citizens bank park. The game was the first of the day night white sox double header. Immediately, although I did expect it to be bigger. Here are some pluses right off the bat: food can be brought in, drinks (even unsealed), can be brought in, and along with the cheap parking and tickets, this makes for a great day at the ballpark. First thing I did was take a 360 walk around the stadium (I prefer stadiums that let you do this and still see the game, fuck Yankee stadium) scoped out other food choices, and bathrooms. Now I've been to plenty of other ballparks besides the home of the Mets. Those include Orioles, Blue Jays, good views from almost anywhere
Now
 To remind you I am a Mets fan, and Darin Ruf really caught my eye both offensively and defensively. He hit a solo blast to dead center to tie the game, and made an impressive sliding catch in foul territory shortly after. He looks like he could be a nice piece moving foward. 
As for the fans, and I got to boo Paplebon like I had hoped. I'm sorry, just don't like the guy. He worked a relatively clean inning to keep it tied, until the rain came around and sent the extra innings into rain deny. At that point, being Mets fans who have seen too many depressing and traumatic extra innings games, we called it quits.

I ate way too much and enjoyed everything I had

As an O's fan

The group of friends I went with wore a hodgepodge of team gear.  The Orioles, and Mariners were all represented.  Many of the fans asked if we were on a ballpark tour.  I got a few looks for having my O's jersey, but for the most part the Phans were polite, conversational, and up-to-date about the state of the league.  All in all a great time.  Thanks, Philly.",,self,,

Opening day tickets sold out in record time

 People want upwards of 30 dollars for a standing room only seat on stubhub (For normal series you can just trade a pack of newports for baseline seats to a scalper)

Your fans are mean. It's one thing to come to Pittsburgh and enjoy a baseball game, its like that highschool football player who picks on the kid with down's syndrome. I wouldn't even care if you guys started a ""Let's go Phillies chant"" that would be fine, whatever. Last season you people started a FUCK THE BUCS chant, a Pirates Sucks chant, and in general just mocked us the whole time. 

You are probably going to beat us.

So basically

1339408793.0,uvy45,"The Phillies, Long Term",chaqalaqalaqa,27,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/phillies/comments/uvy45/the_phillies_long_term/, I think that ship has sailed

* The free agency of Cole Hamels and Shane Victorino
* No clear successor for third base
* A largely unmovable payroll nearing luxury tax threshold
* Aging players at 1B, SS, C, and in the rotation
* Farm system depletion
* Organizational ignorance of advanced statistics

If Cole Hamels leaves in free agency for LA or NY, but is any draft pick worth a tier 1 pitcher?). The same can be said for Shane Victorino, although center-fielders are a bit easier to come by than a very good starter. My first thought is that the Phillies need to do anything they can to keep Hamels, but there is another solution. I know I'm not the first to say it, and I won't be the last, but here it is: the Phillies should trade Cole Hamels. They can get at least one very good prospect back, maybe more, Cliff Lee went through something similar. If the Phillies could get a player like Will Middlebrooks, talent like that would really help the team. Similarly

Third base is a problem area for us. Since Mike Schmidt, Wes Helms, Placido Polanco, and the like have performed okay, but after 2012, what do we do? Some trade/free-agent options are available, such as Jed Lowrie and Maicer Izturis. However, and very few are younger than 30. Obtaining someone such as Will Middlebrooks would be great, they force Jimmy Rollins to move to third base and play Freddy Galvis at shortstop. Jimmy is stubborn, trades more likely

The payroll is manageable. The luxury tax goes up to $189m in 2014. The Phillies will be looking for a new TV deal in 2014 or 2015, but I love to win.

The team is aging. There isn't much to do about it

* 1B: Howard signed through 2016
* 2B: Utley signed through 2013
* SS: Rollins signed through 2014
* 3B: Polanco signed through 2012, no long-term solution
* C: Ruiz has option for 2013
* RF: Hunter Pence under team control until 2014
* CF: Victorino free-agent next year
* LF: John Mayberry and Domonic Brown should compete for the spot

The rotation is somewhat solid. Roy Halladay is signed through 2013 with an option for 2014. Cliff Lee is signed until 2015 with a 2016 option. Vance Worley is under team control until at least 2016. Kyle Kendrick is signed for 2013. Trevor May will be MLB-ready in 2013 or 2014, or the fifth spot. A rotation of Hamels, Halladay, Lee, Worley, and May in 2013 is possible. That would be something, wouldn't it? Other prospects such as Jesse Biddle and Brody Colvin will be ready in the 2014-2015 range

The bullpen is a very cheap area for the Phillies for some time. Besides Papelbon, Justin DeFratus, Jake Diekmann, Joe Savery, and Phillippe Aumont are all low-cost options, with several (DeFratus, Aumont) showing potential. For the immediate 2013 season, including Papelbon

1336979792.0,tm5lo,"Phils Analysis, Third Base",chaqalaqalaqa,24,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/phillies/comments/tm5lo/phils_analysis_third_base/, their future, to try to keep level heads.

**Third Base**

Placido Polanco has been good at third base. A lot of people have been saying ""he's done"" or ""he's an offensive black-hole"". Both of these statements are false. Polanco needs to be taken at face value - he is a very good contact hitter who rarely strikes out

Career: .301/.345/.405

2010: 132 games, 5 SB, 5.3 BB%, 7.8 K% (BABIP: .312)
2011: 122 games, 3 SB, 8.0 BB%, 8.4 K% (BABIP: .292)
2012: 031 games, 0 SB, 3.2 BB%, 9.6 K% (BABIP: .314)

Looking at these numbers, even when an average BABIP. His power is non-existant so far, although he's doing slightly better than last season. I would say that Polanco is struggling as he gets older, and possibly losing bat speed. For this to be a successful season, he needs to walk more, but so do the rest of the Phillies. This will be a problem until Utley and Howard return - especially Howard. With them out, Polanco and others are getting more breaking balls and pitches outside the strike zone, he should be able to be a big enough asset to the team to keep him playing.

A side note, and definitely come in as a defensive replacement.

This year, it's past now and we have to look forward. Next year, Polanco has a $5.5m mutual option with a $1m buyout. Barring a disastrous end of the year, I think the Phillies will most likely pick up the option. If so, fine, but if Polanco has a bad season, they will buy him out. This leaves them without a third baseman for the next year. There's a few options

- Trade for a player mid-season (David Wright
- Sign a big-name 3B in the off-season (same group)
- Move Chase Utley to third
- Play Freddy Galvis at third
- Sign a lesser impact player (e.g. Maicer Izturis) or an older player (e.g. Scott Rolen)

The Phillies will still be relevant in in 2013, at the very least. After that we'll see. So I don't see them signing a low-impact player like Maicer Izturis, or an injury-prone veteran like Scott Rolen (not even mentioning the clubhouse problems and the hatred in the city for him). So that's out. Playing Utley at third is most likely not going to happen, due to his stubbornness. And Utley doesn't have the best arm, don't forget, so there's another reason. Playing Galvis at third makes sense, but I don't think the Phillies will go that route. Why? The next two options.

The Orioles and Mets are not contenders this year. They may have gotten off to hot starts, I guess, but he's not an upgrade over Polanco) may be available. The former has a good chance to be traded out of Baltimore for some pitching prospects. The latter seemed more likely 3 months ago, but the Wilpon's finances aren't as bad as previously thought, and the Mets fans need at least one star. Plus, [the Mets are likely going to sign Wright to a big deal soon](http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2012/05/mets-likely-to-offer-wright-a-long-term-deal.html). So, for either a trade or a signing, but David Wright is **not** going to be wearing red and white pinstripes.

This leaves one very interesting player: Kevin Youkilis. The ""Greek God of Walks"" if you've seen Moneyball. The Red Sox's third baseman seems to be available, and that his contract is up after 2012 (minus the option), and Youkilis could be moved for pitching or prospects. Youkilis is making $12m this year. If the Phillies were to acquire him at the trade deadline for say, Joe Blanton and a single-A prospect or cash, they could pick up his $13m 2013 option, or sign him to an extension. If they don't want to trade for him mid-season, he will be available for trade or signing in the off-season.

From 2008 to 2010, 12 BB%, 18.2 K%

The move to third base in 2011 seemed to hurt him slightly

SS Rollins    (20)
2B Utley      (20)
CF Victorino (20)
1B Howard   (35)
3B Youkilis   (25)
RF Pence     (25)
LF Brown     (15)
C  Ruiz        (10)
Starting Pitcher

That would be a very good lineup, the Phillies would be making an improvement. Youkilis would provide stability behind Howard.

Realistically, if there's interest shown by teams, they will likely pick up his option and that will cost the Phillies a pitching prospect - perhaps Vance Worley, maybe someone better like Brody Colvin or Jesse Biddle. But the Phillies should make every effort to get Youkilis if he is healthy at the trade deadline, unless Polanco is tearing it up. He will be 33 next year. A contract for 2013-2016 would not be out of the question, at about $10m-$13m a year, with an option on the backend.

Why?  Well

First, you have to take into consideration that his OBP was .302 and .296.  This means Delmon Young didn't reach base roughly 70% of his at-bats.  The NL average for OBP last year was .318 AND THAT NUMBER INCLUDES PITCHERS!  Delmon Young is below average.

Delmon Young is not a good hitter.  He's not a good fielder.  Hell

In comparison

Chase Utley hit about .258 the last two years

What's the difference besides just walking more?  Teams will throw more strikes at a guy like Young or Revere because they know both guys are more likely to get themselves out more often than the average.  Ben Revere could develop more

Where was I? Oh, with no real threat to the division. But almost every other year since 2007 we have always had to deal with adversity within the division. Let's provide a little history so we can all remember that we were not always in first place from the beginning of the year to the end of the year:

2007: Everybody remembers the comeback year

2008: As of September 10

2009: Aside from early on

2010: July 15th - Phillies are 5.5 games behind the Braves. If you go from there

Now, good or bad. Also, I can grant you that the division is better than how it's been in the past. But it's still not a great division. This isn't exactly the AL East here. And hey, if we can get Howard back, that's a definite plus. He's always there to carry the team through the regular season.

Maybe I'm a sucker, right?  With exception to the Rockies and Astros, we have a lower winning percentage than every team we're facing.  Tonight may have been a fluke, but it was quite a show.  I know I'm being hopelessly romantic, but I love these guys.  Here's to the next 59?",,False,t5_2qjl8,True

That leaves the roster at:  
**Starters**  
1. Roy Halladay (RHP; 20M next year
2. Cliff Lee (LHP; 25M next year
3. Cole Hamels (LHP; 24M next year
4. Vance Worley (no contract for next year yet)  
5. ??? (I’ll address this in a few paragraphs)  
This brings the total
**Bullpen**  
1. Kyle Kendrick (LRP; 4.5M next year)  
2. Jose Contreras?  (MRP; he has a club option next year
3. ???  
4. ???  
5. ???  
6. ???  
7. Jonathan Papelbon (Closer; 13M next year
Bastardo, Horst, De Fratus, Savery, Herndon, and Diekman all need new contracts.  
This brings the total
**Infield**  
1. Ryan Howard (1B; 20M next year
2. Chase Utley (2B; 15M next year
3. Jimmy Rollins (SS; 11M next year
4. Placido Polanco (3B; 5.5M next year if Phillies accept mutual option; 0.5M buyout)  
5.  ???  
6.  ???  
Frandsen
This brings the total
**Outfield**  
1. Laynce Nix (OF; 1.35M next year
2. ???  
3. ???  
4. ???  
5. ???  
Mayberry
**Catchers**  
1. Carlos Ruiz (5M club option for next year)  
2. Brian Schneider and Erik Kratz need new contracts.  
*Bottom line*: 11 of these guys are locked up for next year
Plus
Should Contreras stay?  Looks like it might be necessary.  Who else do you want to pitch?  
Should Polanco stay?  No.  We should move him now and call up Cody Overbeck from AAA in 2013.  Here’s his Fangraphs page: http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=sa454914&amp;position=1B/3B
Here’s Polanco’s: http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=1176&amp;position=2B/3B
Overbeck bests Polanco in nearly every statistic; his higher BABIP (.300 compared to .272) is an improvement, as opposed to Polanco’s abysmal 19.  
Need a third baseman?  Why not Overbeck?  (Heh
So that solves the third baseman problem.  Now for the two infield bench positions.  Who do we have in AAA?  Pretty much no one except Martinez, and Luna.  Who are our free agent options?  Well, if we want cheap free agents, all I was able to find was Geoff  Blum (just released by the D-backs) Miguel Cairo, and Brandon Inge.  Whoa, Brandon Inge?  I mean, his stats don’t exactly blow you away, the new 3B.  Knowing the Phillies
So I say, release him and try Frandsen.  
Ugh, one more year.  This year was basically an off year for *everyone*, so try him one more time in left, every day.  Nix on the bench.  The last spot should go to a free agent we shouldn’t have gotten rid of in the first place!
Aaron Rowand.  
He’s a free agent next year.  Some might argue he doesn’t hit as well anymore.  Off the bench, however, his WAR (wins above replacement) was *6*.  That is all-star material.  
For the last catching spot, has.  Kratz will be cheaper.  Go with Kratz.  
As for the starters
Tyler Cloyd.  Obviously.  [The stats speak for themselves.](http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=sa455303&amp;position=P)
And the bullpen.  Saved the biggest problem for last.  We do have Papelbon and Kendrick locked up.  Contreras, and one, as much as I hate to say it, needs to go to Bastardo.  As for the last two, we should keep Horst (he’s been okay, I guess.) and sign one free agent.  Looking at the list of free agents for the offseason, barring they aren’t re-signed, and fill up a roster spot until Aumont is ready.  (Should be next year.)  Also
2013 will not blow us away.  But wait patiently, May, Rodriguez, Bonilla, Hernandez, Gilles, James
2013 roster
Halladay, Worley, Cloyd, Contreras, Kendrick, Stutes, Bastardo, Moylan (interchangeable with De Fratus/Aumont), Rollins, Mayberry
tl;dr: don’t expect a ring in 2013, maybe Moylan if we have to, also Amaro spends money like it’s burning a hole in his pocket, that’s why we’re having problems in the first place.  The Phillies literally cannot afford to sign expensive talent anymore because of him, so we have to look for cheap players and hope to strike gold.
