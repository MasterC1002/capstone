So in the sidebar

Okay. I unsubscribed from /r/running for a reason. I take my running relatively seriously, or 40:00 10K PRs. And frankly, I really don't give a shit. I mean, good for you and all, but to be honest, those times are not that impressive. And for the life of me, I could not understand why people felt the need to clutter up the feed with their feeble accomplishments.

Which brings me to /r/AdvancedRunning. The sidebar specifically states:  *post here for discussion of professional running, nutrients and supplements, research and development of running related products and anything else for the competitive runner.*

I think that we need to have some definition of ""competitive running"" that's more than just running. Most of the training questions (specifically in the act of running) that get asked here are more suitable in /r/running

This subreddit is *advanced*. I'm interested in things like how doing a 400 instead of a 200 at the end of a workout would impact the quality of the workout. How

/r/AdvancedRunning is lacking in what it could be. The clutter-posts are removing the important ones by pushing them further down the feed. The activity could be a lot better

In my opinion

1363563720.0,1ahqdq,3rd place at Chuckanut 50k; a (long) story about consistency.,lngdistancrunner,39,1,18,"Sorry this took so long to get out


I started becoming interested in Chuckanut last year right after the race was run. Sage and Max got lost after making a huge, and your road runners met to decide who really was faster. I didn’t completely decide that I was going to all out focus on Chuckanut until August ‘12 after I’d had a wide array of trail running success earlier that year.


My whole summer was back to back weeks of 70-90 miles with one solid long run on the Wonderland Trail starting out around 3 hours, and I didn’t want to fork over the gas money that often. Along with a long run, I did have the good fortune of every other week or so doing a solid hard effort run with a local running superstar. Aside from that my speedwork was essentially nil.


After the summer came to a close and the weather turned in the high country I ran a small XC season with my running club. It went pretty poorly, but clearly nowhere near flat. The two races I had on my mind were Orcas Island 50k in early February, and Chuckanut in March, so I tried to focus my daily running accordingly. My weekly mileage came out to well under 100 per week despite a “daily 14” soem days I’d feel whooped so I’d take a day super easy (5, maybe 6 miles). Other times I just couldn’t get a run in due to work.


Going in to Orcas I wanted to get up to 100 and never managed to get there. Despite which I completely surprised myself and everyone else running 4:21. At 8400 ft of climbing
Last minute I decided to run the Mountain Marathon in Olympia, and less tactically hectic. The Hillbilly Half felt like a long XC race when I ran it in 2012, and I was torched for weeks after, I envisioned the full marathon being an opportunity for a solid 3-4 hour effort with a bib on. The race turned out to be a barn burner, with between 5-6k of climbing and being chased by a sub 2:30 marathoner I absolutely scorched the course running a 45 minute CR in 3:14. I have a hard time holding back in races.


Between Mountain Marathon and Chuckanut I did very little. I ran MAYBE 80 miles in 2 weeks


On race day I honestly didn’t feel tip top, always a mistake. Always.
I think I jogged for a grand total of 60 seconds before the start of the race, so I jumped out to an early lead and was never seen again. I used a similar tactic at Mountain Marathon and it worked wonders. Third time is a charm right? Main problem with this tactic is using it where people can see a full half mile down the trail at the beginning. By mile 3 Max King, David Laney, and Robert Krar had reeled me in and all four of us proceeded to run just under 6 minute miles all the way until the climbing began right before mile 7. At mile 6 King and Laney dropped me and Krar, Krar got a small lead on me leading into the trail and all three of them disappeared. Heading up the first major climb of the course I felt like absolute dog shit. I knew immediately I’d made a huge mistake going out to hard, and my legs were feeling terrible from NOT running substantially for two weeks prior. I don’t know if I felt the attempted recovery after Mountain Marathon, or the hard effort there. Either way i felt something missing. By mile 10 Laney and King had a solid 3 minute lead on me, he dropped due to a calf issue, I’m not sold on its benefits. I ate a hearty handful of endurolytes prior to Chinscraper and I honestly didn’t feel a damn difference


Coming off of the top of the mountain was what felt like my weakest point. I was having a brutally hard time simply opening my stride up because my hamstrings were cramping so badly with every undulation. I could hear cheering several minutes behind me and I knew that I would need some form of miracle on the final 6+ miles of flat back to the start line to hold onto third place. I hadn’t seen anyone after mile 7 aside from Krar and had been running the last 2 hours completely terrified of being caught.


Hitting the final aid station with a touch under 7 miles left to run I got a swift mental kick to the head. I hit the aid station at 3:05 meaning if I ran 40 minutes like I’d planned to before hand I’d finish in 3:45. I left the aid station with no water, no hamstrings left, no chance of catching Laney (I assumed erroneously that Laney had been dropped by King at this point), and assuming there was a group of hungry guys waiting to eat up the last podium position.


The first miles I ran felt like 7s, check the Garmin... 6:11. What the fuck? It felt like with each mile my form got worse and somehow the times just kept dropping. How I held that together for the 42 minutes it took me to get back to the finish I will have no idea. It is without question the most amount of pain I’ve ever tolerated in a race.


I was pretty stunned to get 3rd. I think I managed one fist pump and whoop at the finish before I collapsed.



Take aways for me are as follows:

Consistency matters. It matters most, and none training after that for Chuckanut. THAT is the most important thing to note. I have the slowest “speed” credentials to me of any runner in the top 10 of that race (including the women’s winner), and yet still managed 3rd place and I split the final 10 miles of the race faster than anyone else in the field.

Today is arguably one of the saddest days in running history and a sad day in general for all of mankind. Runners, supporters, and innocent passersby were the victims of a callous attack with no respect for human life at the crown jewel of our beautiful and peaceful sport. 

Therefore I propose we start a fundraiser. I'm very new to this but feel that its the least we can do. I know people always ask for others money for these terrible events but this is personal. This hits home and hits at our core

I'm very new to this, but I'm sure within a few days a victim fund will be setup and I can edit the campaign for that to be where the donations go. 

Are we all on board for this? If we can agree and I get some verbals,000? $10,000?

I will pledge $262 right off the bat. $10 for each mile of the marathon.

&gt;Pass them on the back stretch (after 500m) and don't look back.

- /u/arbitrage10

&gt;Whatever you do

- /u/phimax100

&gt;Your heels should never touch the ground.

- /u/floaticola

I combined these tips with experience gained throughout the season into the following strategy:

Start fast. Draft off the fastest guy (or guys, I'll be ahead of all but the front one or two guys at this point, and they're starting to wear out on the third turn. Draft off them and charge your kick. The second you reach the third straight, move into lane two and accelerate. Not full sprint; it's still too early for a kick. But get ahead of the group. Chances are they think you're kicking way too early and let you go. By 600m, you need to be almost at sprinting speed. The guys behind you are starting their kick. With 150m left, you put it all on the table and hold on for dear life. The biggest thing you could do here is keep up your form: lift your knees, run light, shoulders square. Give it everything all the way through the finish.

Using this strategy, state, and (hopefully) our Meet of Champions left, I'm curious about any pointers you might have before I go into the ""playoffs.""

Miles 1 - 7
Derek rarely wears a Garmin so when I saw it on his wrist that morning, a small shadow lurked behind me. Out of the corner of my eye, a bicyclist appeared in a bright yellow shirt and began talking to my shadow. He said ""Hi. I'm Steve. I'll be with you the rest of the race."" Turning my neck a bit more, a small Ethiopian woman was hot on my heels but she did not pass. Her name was Gedese Edeto and was the lead female for the race. I was running her pace. I was also a hell of a shield for her due to the strong winds. I actually didn't mind her following because I had her and Steve to converse with. If we missed a water stop, Steve would circle back on his trusty bicycle and retrieve us water. At mile 6, something strange happened. Both of my feet suddenly had a pins and needles sensation in them. I wanted to pull off to the side and loosen my laces but then I'd lose Steve and Gedese. Derek was too far ahead and there was only a few half marathoners with us. I decided to see how things went and kept plunging ahead with my shadow. 

Miles 8 - Halfway
Gedese didn't say much. When she did speak, Gedese asked me how many kilometers were left. I know that a marathon is slightly over 42 kilometers but while running that hard, my math is never good. I turned and told her ""A lot."" At the halfway mark, we were left completely alone. With this silence, I realized that my feet were no longer numb which a very good thing was at that moment. I could see Derek up ahead but behind me was no man's land. I was glad to be half over but knew I had a whole lot of work to do. As we turned off the boardwalk and onto Atlantic Ave, we picked up another guest. 

Halfway - Mile 21
Our new guest blasted his siren as we passed into streets lined with orange cones. We now had a police escort. Steve was still with us and rode with the police officer side by side. I don't know what they were talking about but they had some pretty good laughs up there. Around mile 14, Ethiopian Berhanu Mekonen was a teammate of Gedese and as we passed, they yelled encouragement in their native tongue. Several other male Ethiopians passed then a few guys I saw at the start. I saw Derek but couldn't say anything to him because we were about to make another turn. At mile 20, I started to feel the effects of running into the wind. My legs were hurting but as I counted each male that passed us the other direction, I realized I could possibly make top 10. Was the roulette wheel right? 

Mile 21 - 26.2
I wasn't the only one in pain. Gedese fell off the pace and fell back a bit. I'd had to check and double check my pace because I was afraid I was going too fast. I passed 2 other men at mile 21 but the wind was picking up again. At mile 22, the sweat on my had been evaporating at such a rate that it was hard to gauge my perspiration rate during the race. I was severely dehydrated and I needed to take action. Now. At mile 23, I pulled into the water station and came to a dead standstill. I grabbed 3 cups of water and downed them right then and there. I took another cup of Gatorade and walked for about 10 seconds. I started running again and felt a little better. At mile 24, there were a group of older ladies sitting out on their ocean view deck. Each had a cup of coffee in their hands and waved at me. I looked up and jokingly said ""Don't ever do this."" They each let out a large burst of laughter. A few seconds later, I could hear them cheering and the sound of a motorcycle. Gedese had caught me. She passed me at mile 25 and I tried to latch on. My legs could just not go any faster. She said something in her native tongue that seemed encouraging and that sparked me to just keep chugging along. Just before mile 26, a man on a bicycle (not Steve) rode up next to me and offered encouraging words. I never caught his name. Instead, I asked him to stay with me. I asked him about what he had for dinner last night, strong and fast. I responded with ""when I finish

AFTER THE FINISH
 I crossed the finish line and fell to onto the boardwalk on all fours. I was severely dehydrated and exhausted -  but I was elated. After a few seconds - I heard a voice in my head that shouted ""Get your shit together"" and stood up. I was dizzy and confused. Had I just finished a marathon? Where was Derek? Was that Derek's wife cheering for me? What's Quinny doing? Do I need gas for the ride home? I walked to the end of the chute
 

 I made my way to the refreshment table and nothing looked appetizing. Not the bananas, her and several of her friends escorted me with rubber gloves (we are sweaty and stinky sons of bitches after all) to the medical tent. I sat down in a chair and was given several ice packs (I stashed one in the groin area and one behind my neck). A black bag and young brunette were then rushed to my side. The young girl pulled out her stethoscope and unzipped her bag. She asked me ""What's wrong?"" I replied ""I'm very dehydrated. Can you bag me? (IV bag of saline)"" She said back to me ""In the state of New Jersey, only a medic can administer an IV bag."" Hold the phone. I asked her ""Then what exactly are you?"" She replied ""An emergency responder. You'll have to go to the Emergency Room for an IV bag."" I declined that ludicrous offer and simply asked for salt pills and more water. I had to sign a release form when I left due to the marathon liabilities. I’m still not sure why a ""New Jersey medic"" was not assigned to the ""MEDIC"" tent. 
 
 AWARDS
Without getting into too much detail - I walked it off. I took salt pills
 
 I believe in luck. But I also believe that luck is the result of hard work. You can mix numbers to tell any tale you want. But that day, persevered and accomplished my goals - regardless of time.

At mile 18 I started faltering hard and had to get an IV by  mile 22. I ended up jogging it in much later for a whopping 4:13. 

A week later I registered for the Columbus Marathon. I used the 6 week schedule by Pfitzinger but just jumped in on the 2nd week after a week off.

I didn't ever think about the Columbus Marathon. I registered and then just kind of forgot about it. Instead focusing on each day and each run and just trying to enjoy myself. Failing so hard at AF after putting so much pressure on myself was a huge emotional let down. So I was just trying to enjoy the running. 

Yesterday I went to the expo

Last night my Garmin shit its pants on me. The screen just said ""Garmin"" and wouldn't do anything. No buttons work. It wouldn't reset and I was pretty mad. So I eventually mellowed out and took it as a sign that I didn't need a watch. 

Woke up this morning, and 15. 

Up to this point I had been faring pretty well. My 10km split was 39 minutes

So I had caught these two guys and we ran together until mile 19. Mile 18 was cool because we got to run through the Ohio State field. I'm a huge college football fan

This is where shit got fun. I started moving, and 23 I went 18:05. One of those miles was a 5:59 too. (I was just counting off the clocks since I didn't have a watch.) By mile 24, the pain was arriving. I fell back to 6:15 pace and was starting to hurt. The good news was though that I was picking off runners left and right. 

Mile 25 was horrible

I'm pretty happy. I ran with no watch and my pacing was perfect. I was never passed by another marathoner after mile six I believe? So I ran 20 miles of just passing people which was fantastic for my confidence. I smashed my old PR of 2:55:12. I took 2nd out of 270+ runners in my age group (some people are still finishing). And my football team won last night. It was a good weekend. 

The plan for now is to take 7-10 days off and just forget about running. Jog for a few weeks. And then start a training cycle for most likely the Publix Georgia Marathon. 

Tl;dr

Thanks for reading people! Good luck with your training and your races.

If you have any questions, here's what Dave has to say about a few various questions I proposed. 

He also knows I'm putting this up on the forum

*How did you get involved with the B.A.A. and what has been the path that has taken you to race director?*

**Started in 1988.  In 1987, then I was called the Technical Director and then the Race Director in 2001…all along my job responsibilities remained about the same….just making sure there are no mess ups!**    

*How many Boston Marathons have you run?*

**I have run 40 in a row…15 during the day and then 25 at night after my duties as race director are over.**

*What’s your best memory as race director?* 

**Probably helping to direct the 100th Boston with almost 40

*If you could change things and go back and redo your path to where you currently are

**Business wise (I own my own event management business – DMSE

*What advice would you give to someone interested in working in the running industry, or anything in between?*

**Nothing better than to work at something you love and are passionate about but it is very

*The Boston Marathon is arguably the most famous marathon in the world

**My job is to maintain the quality of the race itself and make sure that it all goes well for ALL the participants in the race.  I hope I have succeeded at that over the past 25 years.**

*This year you made it harder to qualify for Boston by making the qualifying times lower

**The worst thing was turning qualifiers away. Didn’t make sense…people work hard

*The Boston Marathon is already a massive race

**To grow participation wise

*Do you foresee any big changes in the “marathon world” that you perhaps would be more privy to knowing compared to runners who don’t work in the industry?* 

**Nothing earth shattering but you never know.  Technology seems to be driving a lot of what we do now so nothing will surprise me.**

*What has been the greatest challenge for you as the race director of one of the most notable marathons in the world?* 

**Probably making needed changes (like changing the start time or instituting wave starts) while also maintaining the history and tradition of this 116 year old race.**

*What do you see as the greatest threat to the continued growth of the Boston Marathon over the next 5 years? 10 years?* 

**As stated above

*How is the Boston Athletic Association and therefore the Boston Marathon adapting to the ever changing world of sports with particular emphasis to social media? E.g., LinkedIn, Facebook, Blogs, etc.* 

**Not my area of the race but I do believe the BAA is keeping pace with social media as much as possible and reasonable. I find all of this overwhelming myself!!!**

*How is the Boston Athletic Association and therefore the Boston Marathon encouraging the growth of distance running among young American athletes considering that distance running is often an overlooked sport and one that does not necessarily “captivate” the hearts of the masses?*

**The BAA does a lot with local schools and youth running.  We have numerous youth programs in place already and will continue to develop those programs over the years.  This is a very important initiative of the BAA.**

*What do you see as the general direction/trend of distance running and what do you think is the driving cause of that direction/trend?* 

**Continued growth in participation. The walls of intimidation have crumbled.  People get it now.  It’s not as much about competition as it is about participation.  It’s about building self-esteem and self-confidence.   I think we are still seeing just the tip of the iceberg.** 

*I plan on doing my internship over my last two semesters with the U.S. Air Force Marathon. If you could offer any suggestions that a new intern could bring to a fast growing and successful marathon such as the AF Marathon to make a very positive impact

**Maybe try to be involved in EVERY aspect of the event to gain an appreciation for what everyone does.  As a Race Director, all motivated, all inspired so as to insure that the end product is the very best that it can be.**

1332270475.0,r5h3j,Race Report: LA Marathon,Wyoming_Knott,27,2,28,"Raced the LA Marathon on Sunday

I've been running for about 5 years, so it's been a process.

**Pre Race**

I decided last year that I wanted to go sub 3 in a marathon this year, tempo around 6:20, and track repeats at 6 min pace (Yasso 800 pace).  I peaked in training at about 62 miles per week, with a couple weeks in the mid fifties and a few weeks in the high 30s to high 40s.  I'll post my training log when I get home, can't access imgur at work.

I hit my last long run 3 weeks out from the race, and finished feeling relaxed, so I was ready for a recovery week, and 2 weeks of taper.  Recovery week was around 42 miles with a solid hill workout in the middle of it, first taper week was 30 miles with a set of 90 second 400s in the middle, and race week was 12 miles, pretty much all easy with a few 400m shake outs on Tuesday and full rest Thursday/Friday.  Thurs/Fri/Sat consisted of a lot of time with my legs up on the couch reading

Nutrition-wise during the week, protein like chicken, and some fruits and veggies, like salad, banana, apple, and OJ.  I made sure I had enough food to eat any time that I felt hungry, in terms of how full I felt and how often I was hungry.  I haven't even counted calories

**Race Day**

Race Day at LA Marathon is brutal if you don't stay at a hotel or have friends to drop you off.  It's point to point, so I was plenty warm (it was about 40 deg F outside).

Warmup consisted of a lap around Dodger Stadium, and another lap.  Then I checked gear and got into the starting corral with about 45 mins to go.

My nutrition plan was as such: 6 gels total, and every 30 from there on out.  This had seemed to work for me on a 30k trail race I did in January.  They had water every mile, so I opted to drink a gulp of water every mile to try and stay hydrated but not have to pee.

After all the starting hoopla and a lot of too-loud announcer babble (speaker was literally next to my starting corral, the race set up to go approximately on time.

Gun went off and I started settled in to what I felt was a decent pace.  The start is a short uphill followed by a couple miles of steep downhill, followed by a 6:27, but my heart rate seemed to be at a reasonable level, so I was OK with going that quickly.  The course flattened out midway through the 2nd mile, and I tried to settle onto a 6:45 or so pace, but it felt a bit difficult.  Additionally, I felt drowsy.  I decided that I was just cold from the downhill (at this point I was wearing running shorts, headband and gloves) and pushed through

I hit the 10k mark at 42 minutes even which felt good because the end of the course featured a lot of false flat and some big downhills, I got passed by a 'Sub 3' group from a local running club, and decided to hop in a draft down Sunset Blvd. which was a little windy.  This only lasted for about 2 miles, or just after the 9 mile mark, because they were clicking off 6:40 pace, which was not going to be sustainable for me, and we hit 9 miles just over 1 hour in.

I let them go, and had just started to feel like this was about to turn into a sufferfest.  My heart rate was still 8-10 BPM too high (higher than similarly paced 10 milers in training), and my legs were starting to show signs of cracks.  I had already made the decision that I was gonna hit splits and make 3 hours, or blow up in epic fashion trying, so my race plan was to keep it up until blowing up.  And that's pretty much exactly what happened.

Mile 17 started to get hard, but my splits were 7:14, 7:09 so I was relatively on track still.  Mile 19 is where things started to fall apart.  Pushing through leg pain and burn is nothing new to me, that's pretty much par for the course if you wanna be a fast runner, I suppose, but I had never had stomach problems before, and my stomach started to cramp, but I pushed through 19 at 7:40

If you've ever been in that situation where you've got a long way to go and you're in a lot of pain, this is gonna be a really shitty portion of time.""  10k of pain feels like forever, haha.  Nothing of note happened in the last 6.2 of the race except that I either had to walk/run or stop to let the cramps subside.  I was pissed.  Mostly because I thought I could handle any pain running would throw at me, but the stomach cramp/breathing thing was a new one, and I did not handle it well.  I at my 5th Gu over the course of a mile or so, but I couldn't handle the 6th later on.

I knew I had no chance at 3:00, I kept having to revise my estimated finishing time.  What ended up getting me is that a guy I know, who I'm faster than, had run a 3:30 at California International last year, so I didn't wanna get beat by him, even though I was in the midst of an epic blow up.  My last miles were between 8:45 and 12 minutes, depending on the terrain

**Post Race**

I stumbled forward for a while, and it took forever to get there.  I drank some water and ate a couple bites of a banana, which did not sit well, and my abs started to cramp/spasm, which was an interesting feeling.

Finally made it to my car and home

Monday my legs were a wreck.  Hips hurt, felt like an old man, haha.  Went for a 2 mile walk after work yesterday, and now today feel a lot better, but am gonna stay off running for another day and maybe try a couple miles easy tomorrow.

The whole experience was humbling to say the least.  I was confident that I could hit 3, and I've thought a lot about it in the last couple days.  What can I do to avoid these problems in the future?  How can I avoid stomach problems, etc.  For one, I think I need more miles.  High 30s for off weeks and a peak of 62 seems like too low.  In hindsight, Hal Higdon is known for his philosophy of undertraining, so perhaps I should have hopped up to the Advanced 2 plan, or looked at other plans like Jack Daniels or Pfitzinger.

On a more holistic aspect, comparatively, to any other tapers I've done for past races, and I had everything planned out, splits, nutrition, hydration, which could have caused the elevated heart rate that I didn't see in race pace training runs

Next race I think will be Santa Rosa Marathon in August.  It's flat and fast and the date gives me a month of recovery from this race followed by 16 weeks of training to prepare for another sub 3 bid.

Feel free to provide feedback.  I'm all ears for improving my training and racing.

The final act in this three part comedy concluded at the Monster Mash Marathon in quaint Dover
- the first mile is on the race track!!) on probably the flattest marathon course in the history of marathoning. The only ""hill"" is at mile 26.2 when you cross the timing mat. I'm not joking. 

I found this race post Hartford when I needed something to give me a shot at winning my running club's Athlete of the Week. 

This marathon road trip was arguably the zaniest of the three that I've taken so far in the past month. For some unknown reason my brother wanted to go with me. Fact: we haven't been on a road trip

We started the 6 hr drive at 5:30PM on Friday

After leaving the casino a little after 12:34AM

I woke up a few hours later, had a muffin, and toed the line. 

We started with the half-marathoners

I suffered a calf-crap at mile 7 that never loosened up. I thought my day was done

It was really peaceful and serene to be out in the Delaware countryside as the sun was coming up (almost like a very hard training run). 

It got a little warm, every water stop had GU. Overkill. I ended up taking 4 GU's just to keep my head in the race. 

My only moment of despair was around mile 16 when I had to take a really bad shit. Fortunately

This run was very similar to my Sugarloaf run when I also ran 2:58 and broke 3 hrs for the first time back in 2010. 

I had to dig deep for the final 10K to get under 3 hours

I managed to finish strong (6:30 last mile) to cross the line in 5th overall and with less than 2 minutes to spare. In the process knocking off Delaware from the sub-3 hour/50 states list. 

Winning time at this race last year was 3:14. I think the top 20 people today were all under 3:14. 

Had a blast spending time with my brother/cameraman. We're thinking Texas next weekend....

Is it better to positive split (go out hard) or negative split (go out conservatively) in a road 5k?

My Thoughts:
I'm not totally convinced which strategy is best to run a fast time.  Tactical championship racing is a whole other discussion.  I'm talking about how to post good times.  800m runners (Rudisha and Solomon, there is something about going out a tad conservatively and finishing hard that can really work well sometimes.

My background (why I am asking):

I was an 800m runner in college and am now trying to make my race the 5k for the first time.  I have discovered I don't really know how to properly race one.  I'm at the point in my training where my time should start to drop

Twists:

What about a flat course

What are your thoughts r/advancedrunning? How did you run your fastest time in a road 5k?  What was the course like, but there can be pro's and con's for each side.

Edit:  Real life twist.  I have [this course](http://www.usatf.org/routes/view.asp?rID=520696) coming up.

________________________________

""Improving basic speed is fairly simple. The scenario I've seen many times is this. Let me introduce you to runner ""Joe.""

Joe is 27 years old, and now runs local road races with an average 5k of 17:30. Joe runs about 40 miles a week and does intervals in the form of 800m and mile repeats in fartlek form with the local club.

Joe can no longer come close to a 10:00 3200. He can't do this because 5:00 for the mile is all he can muster. An 800m in 2:20 is a race for him.

Joe has 2 big problems that are equally important to address 1) Lack of mileage

I look at his recent mileage and plot out a course for raising it. We go to the track and warm-up etc. and I put him through a small true speed workout. I have him run what I call an ""accela 200."" He starts out at mile race pace and builds speed over 200 meters until the last 20-30 are full out. This is always the final component of the warm-up and the beginning of the workout on a true speed day.

Because he has not done any true speed work since high school he will run 1 or 2 200s. I give him 5 minutes recovery and explain that he will run this next 200 as fast as possible while staying relaxed. He jogs into it with a raised hand, 29.7.

I let him know that he will be sore etc. but that his speed will improve. This workout is repeated once a week with the number of 200s increased to 5 after the accela 200. The recovery is whatever is necessary (within reason) to be ready to go again. Usually starts at about 8 minutes and drops to 5 minutes after a couple months. It is never reduced to less then 5.

Joe's progression.

Week 1: 29.3
Week 2: 28.8
Week 3: 28.5, 28.8
Week 4: 28.1, 28.3, 29.2
Week 5: 28.2, 28.5, 28.4
Week 6: 27.7, 28.1, 27.3
(Finally gets around to buying a pair of spikes to use instead of road flats. The last 200 of week 6 was run in spikes. Joe put them on for strides 2 times during the week. He has not been sore so the last 3 will be run in spikes on week 7. Week 8 will be completely in spikes.)
Week 7: 27.5, 26.8, 26.6
Week 8: 26.9, 26.7, 26.2
Week 9: 26.3, 26.6, 25.9
Week 10:25.9, 25.9, 25.8

(During this time mileage was raised from 40-70)

This Joe levels off about here

FOR MOST SPEED IS AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

If muscle imbalances are present drills are introduced to correct them. Usually the speed will fix them if it is run relaxed. Drills and plyos can be helpful but usually distract from the speed and a loss of specificity is incurred. Ability for 400 meter usually starts at 61-62 and drops to 53-55.

Don't over complicate things. Don't excessively worry about drills and form. Just do it and do it relaxed. Devote 1 workout a week to speed until you start to level off. After you level off finish 1 to 2 workouts per week with 1-2 fast 200s. For most people that is enough to maintain speed and some see continued improvement.

I like 200s because those are short enough to sprint but long enough to focus on relaxation.

Some may do it different

My favorite athlete to work with is one who was a B class runner in HS, 2:00 as a freshman in college and then quit. This guy will never make a U.S. national team but just wants to see improvement. Two weeks ago he raced for the 1st time in 5 years, the first time ever indoors, at 4500 feet, and 1 week after the highest mileage week of his life, and without a preparatory time trial, no hard 600's etc. He PRd with 1:59 FAT. He will peak for outdoors and run much faster. The two MAJOR factors? More mileage. More speed.""
___________________________________________

Do you think this is a bad idea to do, 1 longer run, 1 recovery, 3 easy, 2 workouts, and would add these on when I feel it is okay to do so. I ask this because I have always thought the more anaerobic stuff (i.e. 200', 100's, but only got one response.

Male/15, go 27 high in the 200, and maybe 60ish in 400. Specialty is the mile. Thanks in advance! Any questions please ask.

Horrible. (I had to run the JV race

I did my strides, for the past 4 days since saturday like you guys told me to.

I got to the meet feeling very good and pumped to run, I am feeling pretty good then all of a sudden heavyness hits me in the legs and i drop down to 2nd/3rd place (I was also a idiot and didn't use my spikes for all grassy course, I believed one major reason for my horrible races were my spikes but it backfired)

So I am on the 2nd mile now and kids just start to catch up to me

I then catch up to the pack of 3-6th place runners and start to pass them but then the heavyness of my legs kick in again, and all the hardwork I did over the summer, 6,000 miles of gas due to i live 30miles from the school, so 30 there 30 back, 60, and its been 100 days of practice i've been doing for sure so far, first time in 7years we might go to regionals as a team.

I feel as if I wasted these past 5 months doing nothing

Overall I bawled like a baby for the first time in years on the car drive home

1. 2-3 week break, i am naturally fast and can run a 24-25s 200)

I signed up for Boston using this time and at this year's race (2013) I ran 2:34 after following the 85+ mile per week plan. This was the highest mileage plan in the book. I added mileage on here and there during my training

I feel like I have not reached my full potential in the marathon and would like to keep improving

Here are my thoughts on what I was planning on doing for my fall marathon training to try and improve:

1) Higher Mileage: add more to my medium long runs and aerobic runs

2) More strength training in the off season. This summer I would like to strengthen my quads and continue this strengthening a little bit during my marathon training as well. At Boston last weekend my quads were the only muscles that were very noticeably fatigued towards the end and were extremely sore after the race. Nothing else was sore the next day at all. I attribute this to the down hills. I had no trouble on the uphills in Newton

3) A little more marathon-pace training runs. During my training for Boston I attempted 3 marathon pace training runs. Two of which were early in the training cycle and I could not hit my goal marathon pace for those two. I only had one workout where I was able to run close to my goal marathon training pace for an extended time during a long run. I had no problems with the lactate threshold runs.

4) Use a heart rate monitor during my marathon training to make sure I am putting in the appropriate effort during certain workouts and recovery runs.

What do you guys think of these ideas? Do you think I am capable of a sub 2:30 marathon in November after running a 17 minute PR during my last race?

Some of you might remember [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/r5h3j/race_report_la_marathon/) post about my experience at LA Marathon this year, that will preface the first portion of this year in my running life.

Me:

27, 180 lb.

**Preparation**

After the LA Marathon and the disappointing result due to unforseen stomach cramps, so they weren't the easiest miles I've ever run.  Took another week off and tried for Wednesday the following week with similar results.  I was on my bike putting in mileage and that felt good, so I left running at 1 run per week for the month after the race, and just hit significant bike miles until 2 weeks before a Half-Iron that I race every year.  Took 1 whole week off of everything, then eased into the race and felt good, so I knew I could get back into it.

There were a lot of great suggestions for things that I could do to improve my fitness in the comments of my last race report and one of the most common was: more mileage.  The thought was that peaking at a 62 mile week wasn't enough to hit sub 3.  I took this to heart, however, I had to hack out 2 weeks because I didn't have 18 weeks.  Additionally, my summer schedule of traveling was hectic to say the least, so I knew I wasn't going to be able to be as regimented as I was for LA, but this fit well with my attitude about my next cycle of training.

Before LA, few missed runs, no biking...essentially I was a ghost to a lot of my buddies because I was sacrificing my normal social life for my running goals.

After LA, long run tempo, speed work, etc.) is the gospel, but it's gotta be tailored to the individual, so I resolved to continue riding and give up less social events, but also retain consistency and diligence on the run-mileage and quality front.

The major changes I made to my training from the LA Marathon plan were as such: I rode by bike at least once a week for hard interval sets or long epics, chasing breaks, Tour de France, blah blah most of you don't care. Despite the unconventional workout or two during the week, I kept my long run, and at least 1 tempo type run of medium distance (10-12).  My favorite Pfitz workouts were the Lactate Threshold workouts such as '12 miles with 6 miles tempo'.  I chose LT as my major focus, because keeping speed for 26.2 was the goal.  The second major change was that, and more hill repeats in general.  The idea here was to give me some more muscle strength to deal with inclines so that I would not burn as much of my tank on any hills or accelerations.  The final major change was my long run pace.  Several commenters in the LA report suggested that my long runs were too slow.  I agreed

**Taper and Race**

Nutrition during the week of race was pretty standard.  Good balance of carbs, but not ancy, like I want to get more miles.  I spend 9 days total in my taper, which included a 7 mile race pace run 8 days out, an 8 mile easy run 6 days out, a 4 mile run with 3x100m strides 5 days out, 5 miles with 2 at race pace, 3 miles easy, and I think it's because I stretched some/at all before the race

Race day went off pretty well.  Got up, drove to the venue with my buddy, warmed up, dropped a great pre-game deuce and cruised to the starting line with about 10 minutes to spare.  It's a 1000 person race, and the park where everything was located was adjacent to the starting line, so it was easy to literally just step in with the faster runners at the line.  Turns out the 3:00 group was the first group anyway.

When the gun went off, but when we hit mile 1 at 6:37, I decided to back it off to mid 6:40s.  The 3-hour group moved up a bit, and I settled in pace next to another guy, who also was wearing a GPS watch, and we cruised along until the halfway point together.  Joining us over miles 2-5 or so were several people, and we ended up in a group of about 5-7 people pacing for around the 3 hour mark.

At this point, I'm referencing LA Marathon a lot...can you tell I've only run 2 marathons?).  Surprisingly enough, though, the first of two 13.1 mile laps was uneventful, other than I dropped the last 2 of my 4 salt tablets somewhere when I pulled out a Gu (buffered salt tabs: part of my stomach cramp mitigation plan).  Luckily it was 55 degrees and cloudy for literally the whole race...awesome!  While I'm on the stomach cramp mitigation plan topoic: the other plan was to drink an adequate amount of water.  LA Race Report comments determined that I was probably dehydrated a bit and that I was not consuming enough water for sufficient gastric emptying, which cause my stomach lockup.  I agreed with this diagnosis, so I planned in some H20 for the course.  At mile 11 I grabbed a half bottle of Gu Rocktane drink from my friend.  This is about 135 calories of electrolytes and carbs, but in a more easily digested format.  This was key.

Training has been well, good breakfast. Lunch I had a 32oz Vanilla Hulk from smoothie king (favorite smoothie ever, 1300 calories, loaded with carbs, good amount of protein, just all around goodness). Dinner I had a smaller than usual serving of pasta, didn't want my usual mt. everest size plate. 

Wake up morning of race a bit late because I'm an idiot and set my alarm for 4:30 am Monday not 4:30 am Saturday. So now it's 5:20. Eat half a bagel and one boiled egg with a little salt. Couldn't eat anymore, 10k, half, and full). Did like a 3 minute warm up just so I didn't shock my legs when the gun went off. I had to pee about five minutes before the race and it was decently yellow but I shrugged it off. 

Race starts and I go out with the previous years winner, 5:47 for the 3rd mile which has a massive downhill, and then we settle into some 6:00-6:03's. We're popping them off no problem and so casually they we were doing quite a bit of talking. It was just me, Mark, and one of Mark's friends. Then come mile 11 Mark had to stop and use the Portajohn, so that left me and his friend, we quickly passed 6th place and then caught 5th place and ran with him. From miles 11-18 we ran mostly 5:55's to 6:01's. And then it happened. Almost immediately at the start of the 19th mile My legs went to shit, with no warnings. I struggled to put out at a 6:30 for that mile. I managed to toughen up and put down a 6:20 for the 20th mile but this was becoming unbearable. And the sad thing is, I shook out my legs and then started running again. About a half mile later was the water stop. When I got there I stopped and drank for about 90 seconds before trying to run again. I'm in 7th place now out of 5500. But really quickly my friend Mark came running by and told me to relax (I don't think he knew what was happening). The problem with the last part of the 21st mile and the start of the 22nd mile is that it is an overpass. It was agonizing making my way up that overpass alone. All the half marathoners were on the otherside of the road separated by a concrete divider. And here is this lone marathoner, I was still shivering really bad. The doctor said the sudden onset + how I looked + how bad I was shivering even though I was 22 miles into a marathon + how cold I was to the touch = severe dehydration. So there you have it

I was pretty devastated. 8 months of training and it seemed wasted by such an amateur mistake. I took a bit of water/gatorade at every stop in the race too. I ended up breaking down about 25 minutes later and honestly just cried for a few minutes. 

Spent a lot of time thinking about it yesterday and then decided I still needed a Boston Qualifier and I have the connections to get a slot even if the race is full

This time I will definitely hydrate more the day before, stop and drink at each station if it means I won't have a body failure at 18-22 miles. I also might toy around with the idea of salt pills or something which will keep sodium in my body because as we all know sodium keeps water in you. 

So yea

I'll edit to clarify anything if need be. 

Good luck training guys and I'm now 8 weeks away from my next marathon (unfortunately) :p.

I did miserably. Finishing 4:51 to second place

So I went and did 3* 200m, and the same distances coming down, accelerating pyramid exercise on Tuesday just to experience the speed. I went all out, finishing my final 200m well under 30sec. The exercise was quite hard for me and I felt the effects yesterday. I had sore legs and felt that I just wasn't on top of my game.

The race was 5 laps (well almost because the track was 304m). First lap was on schedule but I started falling behind a lot already on the second lap. I was able to kick the final lap almost for the right time though. I just couldn't handle the speed I think.

1362887859.0,1a09yc,Advanced runner feeling lost and out of shape from injury,trilll,12,1,4,"This my be VERY long: I'm in my first year of university now and I'm pretty lost mentally and running wise. I ran 4:24 and 9:26 my senior year in April 2012. 5k PR is also 15:42 from October 2011. I feel like I have untapped potential. Never had a fully fantastic training period - always cut short or cut back by coach's orders. I didn't train seriously after graduating

Over my holiday break I put in a hard load of training on my own up until New Year's Day. I was feeling great and I jumped from 45 to 60 miles in one week which I think caused injury. Should have built up gradually but I got too eager). I've been out with runner's knee and ITBS since then and really haven't done anything. It's been 10 weeks. It's gotten a lot better since, but will it be a lot harder for me to return to my high school PRs? I'd like to run 15:15 in a 5k around July/August for personal satisfaction. I am going to start up a Daniel's plan but I think my goal may be too unrealistic with the long break I've had due to injury?

I'm also having a hard time figuring out what I am doing with my college running career. I cannot decide on where I'd like to transfer. I would be transferring mainly for running if I decide to do so. I am not at a strong academic school now so I wouldn't mind, I had a spring racing schedule of public races planned out for myself. I was very excited to run fast. At the same time, I was somewhat sad I am not running track at university as I feel that's what I really should be doing as a typical freshman. But right now I just want to find happiness. After I run these summer races, I need to figure out what I will do long term. I want to enjoy a team and be normal but I've been viewed as a loner at times. I will say though that my university teammates - for the short time I knew them - seemed to care more about alcohol than competing. I need a team more dedicated. My high school team none of us messed with drinking or whatever, we just liked running and hanging out at a movie. I know university life is different and more mature/adventurous than that and maybe that's my problem that I can't adjust to that. I am excited for the next few months run fast again. I am going to talk to my high school coach soon for advice. However I would truly appreciate any redditors willing to chime in on all I have written :)

I am in the middle of California's track season, with some change, equating to a 4:50.44/72.61. The race went well, but now I need to re-focus my energies on making the next jump downwards in my times. Training has been going well, and my coach and I both feel like I'm primed to make some solid improvements in the next five weeks. But first, some background information:

I'm a high school sophomore, 4:50, 10:45, 17:40 (XC). Averaging 35-45 miles per week, with a usual weekly schedule looking like this:

* Monday-Long recovery run (9-10m) @ 6:45 pace
* Tuesday-Medium run (6-7m) @ 7:00-7:20
* Wednesday-Workout, 300 @ 52, 200 @ 34 (went faster though, just targets) +(2x150).
* Thursday-Medium run (6-7m) @ 7:00-7:20
* Friday-Pre-race 4-5m @ 7:30-7:45
* Saturday-Race, 2-3m cool down
* Sunday-Off
* (Sample Mileage=39 miles)

This is generally what a week with a race looks like, and long run Saturday. We also lift two times a week, and stretch and foam roll everyday.

My goals for the season are to break the F/S School Record in 1600m (3200m also, then went 4:52, 4:56(hot, tired, etc), and now 4:50. Work-outs have been going well. For example, here are two recent w/o's I completed:

* 91 sec || 500 m ||
* 51 sec || 300 m || 
* 31 sec || 200 m || 
* 93 sec || 500 m || 
* 52 sec || 300 m || 
* 32 sec || 200 m || 
* 88 sec || 500 m || 
* 50 sec || 300 m || 
* 30 sec || 200 m || 
* 22 sec || 150 m || 
* 21 sec || 150 m ||
 
 and 

* 0:03:23 || 1000 m || 5:26 Pace
* 0:03:26 || 1000 m || 5:31 Pace
* 0:03:21 || 1000 m || 5:23 Pace

My question for AR is this: What am I doing right, what can I do too improve my mile time? Any workout's you guys really like to test/improve fitness? Any tips or suggestions for thing to incorporate.

If you have more questions for me about my training to improve your answer

**Here was my last thread:** http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/14krcw/reporting_in_for_a_update_on_myself_danxorhs/ can follow back to the rest of them as well

**Training:**
I feel a lot faster

I even bought 3 running books for the mental side of running/racing better and just..5:50 I couldn't believe it

But..heres the interesting part..: So 3rd day of track, it isn't crazy workouts to the absolute point of exhaustion, it is tireing and hard..but the main coach def. knows what hes doing

**Times for other events:**
Oh I also ran a 800m (the event i am aiming for) and ended up making a stupid mistake and ran the 1st lap at about 1:00 (first 200m was probably around 26s) so I faded away to 2:24 (proper pacing I KNOW i can hit 2:10 right now)

5th day(fri): I ran a race 400m to determine where everyone is right now in sprinting, and past year even if my mile/2mile times weren't even that ""good"" this is what it was working for, the 800m endurance.

**Overall:**
Main coach who has coached state caliber athletes has put me into sprinters to up my speed to make the 800m ""easier"" and he really knows what he is doing

**Questions:**
What do you guys think of all of this? Great change for me? I am naturally pretty fast I know I can run a 200m in about 23-24 (not sure about 22s)

Running the 400m and 800m on your toes a good thing? I have noticed in the 800m I can run on my toes until about..500m then I start to fade away from my toe running and my calves give out (and I have very strong calves) how should I run it?

1355795760.0,1510de,Injury &amp; Frustration: Any hope of getting back to competitive running?,Croixrousse,11,2,9,"I used to be fairly good: Junior year of high school I was 2nd place at my state cross-country meet

Senior year things went downhill. The summer before that year, crushed a few early-season meets, then succumbed to overtraining, finally calling it a season two weeks before the state meet when I realized I had tibial stress fractures as well. The rest of senior year was several attempts to get back to training only to get hurt again from progressing too fast.

I went to a D1 college with a good running program, at last, I put together a full cross-country season - nothing impressive, ending up ~60th place at Regionals, but it was a joy to be competing in some fashion again! This was the first time since high school that I'd raced in a team uniform of any kind.

Then immediately after the end of the season I came down with bad knee tendinitis (it had been bugging me on and off for much of the past year but got worse at this point.) So I spent the early part of 2012 very slowly getting back into shape again. I just managed to break 15:00 in my one track race at the beginning of the summer. Summer training went alright until mid- July when the knee problems came back in full force. At this point I quit the team

At the beginning of this, had a month of running 70+ miles/week, raced one decent road 5K, then promptly got hurt again, mainly with the same old knee tendinitis (at least, I think it's tendinitis; pain that comes on during the run in the bony area where the patellar tendon inserts into the tibia, and is particularly noticeable when doing a deep knee bend.) Since mid-November I have not had a week over 40 miles, either. 

At this point I am severely frustrated and dead tired of (metaphorically speaking) banging my head against a brick wall. I have had a grand total of one injury-free season of racing since junior year of high school, it seems like almost every run has a comment along the lines of ""this was sore"" or ""that was hurting for the last 3 miles"" or some such. 

At the worst moments I do contemplate giving up, I remember how much I love this sport and how essential it has been to my happiness and my idea of myself as a person since about the 8th grade. The rare intervals of smooth healthy running between injuries are absolutely delightful, and I don't know what I'd do with myself in the absence of competitive running. I do NOT want to admit what my body seems to be telling me, which is that I will never get back to the glory days of mostly injury-free running, and regular competitive racing at a level that reflects my abilities; that high school will have been the pinnacle of my running career.  

Is there any hope of beating these injuries, setting PRs, and all that? Or am I deluding myself by keeping at this?

So I basically have 2 questions. First of all, plan. I was thinking about hitting maybe 60-70 mpw with 4 doubles a week and substituting hill workouts for some of the tempo or speed workouts outlined in the Summer of Malmo, since I've never done well with hills and the regional cross country meet is on a very hilly course. So here might be a sample week:

* Monday -- AM: 3-4
* Tuesday -- AM: 3-4
* Wednesday -- 10
* Thursday -- AM: 3-4
* Friday -- AM: 3-4
* Saturday -- 13
* Sunday -- 6

However I'm not sure whether it would be better to do more mileage in singles or doubles

* How do I get over burnout (if that is what I'm experiencing)?
* Does 60-70 mpw sound like a reasonable amount of mileage over the summer?
* Is it a good idea to double

My second question: what can I do to prevent something like this from happening in the future? I feel like the problem may have been with my training during indoor track, so I'm hoping that I can get in good shape and start to see some improvement again. Thanks for your advice.

Also, rather slow. Funny story though. I was in a close race with my county rival. As the race progressed I kept extending the lead a couple meters at a time. Just before the 2 mile mark I took a wrong turn, for I was in the fucking zone, my friend yelled back to me and was all, ""JUSTARUNNER, YOU TOOK A WRONG TURN!""

So I run club XC at my school

**A tWiSt In ThE sToRy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

I am in Naval ROTC

So right there that's three workouts in a row, I'd go run later in the day on Wednesday, bringing me to 20 miles in 24 hours with a good deal of those miles being run at race pace. Throw in a long run on Sunday, and that's 4 workouts in a row. Race on Saturday? Make it 5.

I had/have been trying to practice pushing off with my toes a little bit more which resulted in tendonitis. This was really a combination of both curling my toes when I pushed off and broken orthotics. Fixing the curling and fixing the orthotics has made the issue go away, but then I'd be back at 50 mi/week and feel great about it. FINALLY, my ankle started getting it's act together and I was able to get in not one, not two, but THREE 50 mile weeks in a row, including the whole 4 consecutive workouts/week thing. I was feeling great and I ran a PR 5k at the beginning of it all, and finished it up with a very tiring 8k performance. Now that the 8k is behind me, my body is fried.

My legs have been dead and just lacking speed. I can't seem to round up any pace faster than 7:00/mi. I'm experiencing a good deal of tightness and soreness in my lower calves (below the bulge)

tl;dr: not sure if i overtrained or just peaked too early

The format for making finals was top two of each heat and next two fastest. I was a little worried about getting in to the top two as there was two guys with faster seed times than me

The weather for prelims were just about perfect. Little wind, but had a little gap to make up. My kick has been great the last couple of weeks, but I just hadn't felt great. With 200m to go though I had closed the gap on the third place runner as him and the now 2nd place runner were starting to hurt and I was surging. I got into 2nd place with about 75m to go and held on without having to kick too hard, so onto finals. It was a good thing I got 2nd in the heat because a 3rd place would have left me out of the finals.

The next day was finals, but feeling ready to go. Unfortunately, the guy to my outside surged as well and I go trapped into this position, so I was still in 8th with 300m, but not too far behind the leader. Tried surging again but same situation happened, so with 200m to go I was still in last. The top 4 finishers started their kick now and I was stuck in last. It wasn't until about 100m left to where I was able to kick, but the top 4 opened up about a 5m gap on the guy in 5th. In that last 100m I was able to close on everyone, as they finished about 5-10m ahead of me. Winner ran a low 1:56 (was a teammate) and I ran a 1:57.3x

Had I been in 3rd or 4th with 200m to go, so we will never know. I definitely learned my lesson to keep myself in a position on the track to move around in the race and easily move up.

Looking back on the season though, so I am pleased with my season and learned a lot about my own training and racing.

Does anyone have some tips or suggestions on how to tackle this problem? 

**Race Recap:**
I got to the track at around 6:40 and my race was scheduled for 8:20. The meet was perfectly run and right on time, a friend of mine, and we went back out for another 8 minute jog. 

He decided to go for a bit longer, plyometric stretching, and a few strides then it was time to head to the line. The girls 3200 had just finished (awesome side note: the girl that won lead the race from the first step and did a 9:57, 2nd place was a 10:36. But as she cross the finish line her boy friend had this huge banner that read ""PROM?"" and so that was pretty cool) and everyone moved to their positions on the waterfall.

 I forget what it's called when there is a 2nd, but we had that start and I was positioned in the middle of the 2nd water fall.

The gun went off and I had a great start, I don't have as a great start as last time. However it's still a good start and our group merges well with the main group at the end of the first turn. 

We continue down the back stretch and I find myself in roughly 20th place. The second turn approaches and I managed to find the inside of lane number two, right now the total time from 1st to 30th was around 5 seconds so everyone is in a tight group.

You really forget how physical the 3200 gets, but I feel really good. I could win this"", however as we complete the second lap I hear a coach scream ""what the fuck was that?!?!?!? a 74? On lap 2? You have to be shitting me"" The entire pack probably thought in their heads those words verbatim. The pace slowly starts to speed up and I decide to move up from my 23rd or so place spot.

Right at the end of the 2nd turn I find the outside lane and move around the tightly huddle pack in front of me. The announcer reports my move and says my name

Two guys pass me as we reach the halfway point. A 4:42 is my 1600 split, 69, 72. Not exactly the most optimal thing, but you have to make do. After some slight jostling for position we go through in another 72. This is where things start to get bad for me. I start to feel the pace speed up and the gap between me and the person in front starts to widen. People start to pace me at a slow and steady rate.

The only way I can describe it is like I stopped racing and was just running. I go through lap 5 in a 74

I pass one last guy with about 50m left to go and would of caught the rest of the 5 man group if the race had been for 3250m, but now I just feel hollow I had a chance to be with my two friends in that magic sub 9:20 range. But instead I missed qualifying for New Balance Outdoor Nationals by 3 seconds, but I know that this is just the beginning of the season and that I'll have more chances down the road. Still It would have been nice to do it in my first real race of the season. 

Oh well

Back to my question though, workouts, ideas, suggestions, or anything that might help my problem with laps 6 and 7?

Anyway thanks for reading this far

(**Note**: a row with a date has what I was supposed to do for that week. The next row has any deviations

Basically I ran a 5K in early May and plugged my time into RW's smart coach (I was scared of hurting myself) and stuck religiously to the plan. I stuck with that plan for a few months then ran 10K on the track and used that time or my official marathon training plan, RW had me up my easy pace to 8min/mile. Then on Thanksgiving (Nov 24) I ran a 5K. I had no idea how fast to go, as I rarely run shorter races. I ended up with 18:26. This is very fast for me, before this my fastest was 20:20. I again upped my speed.

[Websites](http://www.runbayou.com/jackd.htm) will say that an 18:26 signifies a 2:58:high marathon

I slacked on my running, of course) and the fastest I'd ever run the distance was in 1:32:31 (first half of Houston), and I'd been *slacking* for the last month. I ended up with 1:27:47 and I felt like I could've easily knocked it down to a 1:26:xx if I hadn't had beginner's fear. I honestly was a little terrified when I realized that I'd done the middle 6-8 miles or so at about a 6:33 pace. On a flat course I think I could have at least gotten down to low 1:25.

A couple weeks later I ran a 5k (slacking more than before my half marathon) and came in at 18:36. Not as good as my 18:26

Anyway

I don't do gels or GUs (lazy, non-speed days too slow. If anyone has any insights I'm all ears and am very thankful. I'm gonna try again for &lt; 3:05 at Houston in January.

Last summer I did multiple 20 mile runs with the longest one at 22. I would like to run a marathon this summer just to say I ran one.

1359318420.0,17dupw,Could use some feedback on my plan based on Daniels plan A,bovan,7,0,10,"**Me**  
I’m a 33 yo male, hope to double that before the race)

The 22. June I will be running my first half marathon roughly 12 months after I started running
.  
**Primary goal**: Half Marathon Jun 22  
No time set yet

**Secondary goal**: Be fit for completing a marathon Sep 7
.  
.  
**Background**

I have not been training anything since '99 when I was in the military. At the time I was able to run a sub-11 3km only on soccer/football practice.

Fast forward to 2012: with very little training (mostly hiking and bicycling to work for 2 months) my best results the *first month* were:

* Cooper: 2.58km
* 5k @ 24.42
* 10k @ 55:47
* HM @ 1:59 (training run

I was able to run ~35k per week (20 mpw) out of the box. My first race was after 2 months and 255km of training: 

8km @ 35:50

Since then I’ve run 800km and am now almost at 65km per week (40 mpw); This running has mostly been slow so the times I’ve set since have not been all out:

* 1km @ 3:51 as fifth interval  
* 10km @ 48:58 with first half steady and second as tempo  
* HM @ 1:59 (Mostly aerobic except for last 3km)  

Over the last 6 months my VDOT according to Jack Daniel’s tables has barely changed, but hopefully it’ll not suck.  
.  
**The plan**  

I hope to follow Jack Daniel’s Marathon Training Plan A (got the book! but have been jumping back and forth)

* April 18: 4km XC
* May 14: 10km (Priority)
* May 23: 3km XC
* May 30: 4km XC
* June 13: 6km XC (May consider skipping)

For those unfamiliar with it, long slow run, long steady run and tempo. The rest of the week one does easy runs to get to 80-100% of peak mileage (+ a taper the last weeks)

I will try to modify the plan with a small taper for the 10km

.  
**Questions that pop up in my head**

* Is 40 mpw (the mileage I intend to run next week) a correct peak mileage based on my history?  
*11/14 of the last weeks have been in the 27-40 miles range
* I’m not gonna set any goals for my Marathon in September yet
* Any tips for how to incorporate the XC races into a plan?
* Am I biting off more than I can chew?

(The only copy I've found online of those intensity zones is [here](http://www.olympiatoppen.no/fagavdelinger/trening/utholdenhet/fagartikler/oltsintensitetsskala/page594.html), and is essentially working at 94-100% of VO2max.

I am back after 3-4 months from my last thread on this subreddit you can see it here http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/18uz4f/update_on_danxorhs_1st_meet_yesterday_probably/ and follow my previous threads here over the course of a year so far.

**400m**So I guess I should start off with

**200m** time was only officially I believe a 23.8 but the same kid in practice who ran a 23flat

**100m** time unofficially is 11.3 from a home meet we had

So roughly I would say I at the end of the season I was at 100m-11.3

Now why am I here? Well towards the every end of the season week of districts and regionals my legs were ridiculously heavy and it was rough trying to sprint is this because I had been working hard since december and it finally caught up to me? It's just a question I am curious about.

**Second
I am trying to walk onto my Universities track team

Well

Do you guys think it is possible with enough hard work over the next 4-6 months that it is possible to reach those times?

Now, not that I do not trust him or anything I just would like to see my options out there and how to train myself, it is possible you guys can give me way more advice or videos for the 3point stance thing (which i still do not know how to do, i always ran my sprints standing up...)

I was able to find a incoming freshmen who is willing to train with me everyday, or use their facilities at all. The university I am at has a amazing gym and healthy food, a practice track, a indoor 200m track. It is just awesome.

If anyone decides to help me out, to a pretty good sprinter.

**I am willing to bust my ass every goddamn day to make it onto this team. I have the work ethic for it and I just need someone to guide me along for me to achieve it.**

1367595579.0,1dmgy7,My return to running and my hopes for Boston (X-post from /r/running),whoatemychips,8,3,4,"(I’m a poor writer so please excuse all the mistakes and the overall crappiness of the text below!)

I recently started running again after 9 years of very little exercise. After graduating high school in 2003 I had run about 200 miles before this recent start up.

My last year of running before the long break was very disheartening seeing as though I made little to no improvement. I had been pushed by fellow runners up until that point but during my senior year there was no one near my skill level and I was running to stay in shape more than to improve. I ran a 9:39 3200m during the end of my junior year was aiming for 9:15 my senior year which I didn’t come close to. With a 9:42 being the best I could do with the second fastest person on my team being an 11:15 I hung up my running shoes and didn’t continue in college.

I have always had to the goal of running the Boston Marathon but was never able to get back into shape without injuring myself quickly. With this recent attempt I found a group to run with that helped me keep the pace and mileage slow and low when starting out.

Here is a rundown of my workouts since I met up with my running group:

Start stats: 5’9 170lbs 27/m

Feb 6th – Feb 27th – Workouts: 3 Distance: 19.4 Longest: 8.5 (Run that caused injury Feb 16th)

Feb 27th – Mar 20th – No workouts

March 21st – April 11th – Workouts: 8 Distance: 40.53 Longest: 6.6

About the races: -The first 5k was just 3 weeks after I started training and I wanted to use it to gauge my speed and abilities at this point. It was a flat course and breaking 20 minutes was the goal that I set and barely met. I have been blessed with natural talent that allowed me to do so well for my first race. -The 10k that I did in January was extremely painful and forced me to walk 2 times during the duration of the race. I had the goal of breaking 39 minutes and surprisingly did so with very little room to breath. -In April I was a bit worried for this race seeing as though it had a nice 150ft elevation gain in the first .5 miles of the race. I had also been injured for most of February and March so I wasn’t sure how I would do. I had the goal of breaking 18 minutes and fell short seeing as though the hills in this race were too much for me to handle at that speed. The last mile of the race hit me very hard mentally and I told myself I would never race/run again because I never wanted to willingly hurt myself this bad again. -Finally the goal of moving up distances brought me to my first half marathon. I was still trying to recover from my arch injury and couldn’t get my mileage up to properly race this distance. My sister asked me to run this half marathon unaware of how hilly it was but seeing as though she would spot me half the entry fee I decided to suck it up and go for it. Here is the course: http://www.lajollahalfmarathon.com/Assets/La+Jolla+Half+Marathon/LJHM+course+map.pdf It includes an 80ft climb on mile two, and to top it all off they kill you in the middle of mile 12 with a 150ft climb! Knowing this and how I nearly quit running during my last 5k I decided to run this ½ instead of RACING it. I’d stay in my comfort zone and stopped and walked whenever I felt a little strained. I got strange stares for the people handing out water as I walked up to them stopped and drank :D even took a nice bathroom break right before the big hill! I am extremely happy that I broke 1:30 on such a tough course and with very little effort and helped my mentality towards running for the better.

Qualifier race date: Friday, 7PM

Now onto my goal of qualifying for the 2014 Boston Marathon! I had been shooting for 2015 until the recent tragedy which drove me to my new goal. The problem with this is that there are very little Marathons to run in the time left to qualify. I live in Southern California and do not have the income to freely travel the country. I found the marathon I want to get my qualifying time at but there are a few problems with the choice I made. First it is in Massachusetts where the summer humidity is going to be extremely taxing on me for the 3 hours I will be running. I will only be there 3 days prior to the race to get use to these conditions and hope it does not prevent me from completing the marathon. Secondly it is a loop course and I will have to complete 8 3.17 mile loops along with another smaller loop to finish the race. I plan on doing my long runs in this fashion to prepare myself for the dullness of it and to help familiarize myself with this sort of running. The race starts at 7pm which I think will be in my benefit since I will still be on California time. The race in question: http://www.srr.org/events/annual_events/24hour/index.php “Scenic, paths, and office park access road) except for a 35 yard section of dirt path. The marathon course is USATF certified (MA10007JK). The marathon is a Boston Qualifier” Now the question is my fellow runners, do you think this is enough time for me to reach my goal? I plan on increase my mileage up 10% each week until the taper. I will solely be doing mileage seeing as though I know I have the speed to run 3:05 or faster it will just be am I physically and mentally strong enough to go the distance!

I found a pavement on the edge of the route and got some space to run faster, I managed to get the 'deficit' down to 8 seconds.  Then my pavement ran out and I had to join back into the main stream.   Almost immediately my deficit was back up at 30 seconds again.  So it went on for the first 5km.

I am currently getting into my summer base-building phase and I have a question about how you handle speedwork during it. I will be 25 next month

Anyways

Anyways, couple days of light speed work. I like it and I can stick to it. 

My question comes with trying to determine how much and how fast to run the workouts at. He says 200s

-What kind of pace should I be looking at for 400s and how fast?

-Also, we usually do 10 miles at slightly slower than 10km pace - these seems like they provide different benefits, I wonder if one is better at this time, at the very beginning of the season.

Any stuff you guys have to say about what you do during summer base building would be great. Right now I am only at like 55 km a week, so that I am not burned out come fall, but ready to hit the track and pick up some speed.

Thanks!

**My History**

Sorry for the length that will follow

**Freshman year** high school I try out track. Realize I'm pretty good at it and like it. Do the 400m. Unfortunately I suffered from an inflamed groin which took me out for a bit. The groin injury still haunts

**Sophomore year** high school I do track again. I try out the 800m and realize I'm a lot better at that with a 2:08 800m compared to my 54 400m. Talk to the cross country coach and decide to do XC the next year.

**Junior year** high school I do cross country. As soon as we increased the mileage and intensity I started hurting, had very bad shin splints, and on top of that I had a stress fracture. Doctor said not to run, but stupid me decided I could make it until state qualifiers since my team needed me. Fast forward to weeks and I have the race of my life, but someone tripped me 400m from the finish. If I hadn't tripped we would of gone to state =( I had a lot of pain in track, which prevented me from doing a lot of the workouts. Still had an okay season though. Even decided to try the mile and finished with a 4:50.

**Senior year** high school XC was horrible. Started with injuries from the start and was never able to make up the ground I lost. This is where it gets freaky. For my track season I was determined not to get injured. I did this by....not practicing. I did 4 speed workouts the entire season and ran 15 miles a week at the most, I was able to run without pain. Doing so allowed me to get my PR of 4:37

So there you have it. My running history. I'm now in my second semester of my freshman college year. Right now I can maintain a 6:50 pace for about 7 miles. That's the only benchmark I have. I'm not running for any team so I now have the opportunity to start fresh. I know I have a lot more potential and am far from my peak. I want to get there the right way

So I ask for your advice. What can I do to start from the beginning so that I can be a strong

Note that this will be a bit long.
I started running Freshman year of high school. Running was basically one of the main reasons why I chose the school I did. It was always something I strove to do in high school. Unfortunately I got injured (stress fracture) at the end of Cross Country and missed a month and a half of training. I had a miserable Indoor season and was cut from Outdoors. I then went on to train on my own until I made the team again during a summer time trial.
Sophomore year I ran okay I guess. I never had the great commitment at that point in time and just kinda accepted everything as it came to me. I didn't really aim for anything big. That's kinda what screwed me over, and went into Cross the next year in the best shape of my life.
But that's when I got a second stress fracture
Now here I am during my Senior year at the end of summer training, but I don't think commitment will help me achieve my goals in three seasons. What should I do? Please, if you can offer any advice, I would be so thankful. This is something I haven't really shared with anyone else.

**Some background**:
I'm a runner of average ability (25, my HM time is 1:56. Every running calculator I find tells me I should be able to do a faster HM given what my 5K time is, and it seems I don't have enough of an aerobic base.

So I picked up Phil Maffetone's Big Book of Endurance Training, from a book no less, so any input is welcome.


**Questions**

1. My pace is really, so I'm definitely going to stick with this for at least 6 weeks.

2. I'm doing all my runs at this heart rate. Right now, and a longer run once a week (10 miles this week). These numbers will gradually go up, but is this the right thing to do? Should some runs be even slower? Should the long run be a little faster?

3. Speedwork - the book says stay off speedwork till there's a decent aerobic base built

4. I'm doing all of this in Bombay, I end up having to go really slow, sometimes having to walk to get my heart rate within target range. I did one long run on a treadmill indoors, and I was able to stay in range for a lot longer with a faster pace than outdoors.
My question is, 10bpm to my aerobic range to account for the heat since my heart rate probably is higher to keep my body cooler, not because of the running effort?

5. Weight training: I want to lose some weight and get some core work in too, so I'm not too sure about this.

Thanks in advance for any advice

1.) How do you determine your ideal racing distance?  This has me wondering if I'm more suited for a half-marathon than a mile (though the 4:44 mile is still my ultimate goal).

2.) Is this simply a miscalculation of the proper effort for the long run?  Is this a result of me doing no speedwork and therefore being able to run at only one pace (6:00-7:00) because I have no kick?

3.) Or is it possible that my 19:36 5k was so hilly that I am actually faster than that by far?  I know the second question can only be answered by running another (flat) 5k

S2S Relay Race Report:

In the part of myself that I define as a runner (or insofar as running defines me), joy and turmoil with five others magnified and diversified the experience even further.

It began in Fort Myers. Some of my teammates had gotten to run already and I was feeling alright. I felt uncertain because I had a headache and wasn’t confident in my nutrition

The leg went well and I finished the 5.9 miles at a 7:13 pace. We kept moving as the sunset was coming on and soon we were gearing up for night legs with our reflective vests and lights we were ready to fly.
The distinctive sight of a headlamp glowing in the distance –easily distinguished from headlights, especially when the next leg was mine. Then, when the time came, the energy would burn off in the first mile and questions about pace and sustainability would enter my mind, accompanied by repeated checks of the watch. This concern subsided more and more on each of the night legs. It was replaced to a greater and greater degree by a tremendous sense of serene strength and power and an increasing sense of rapturous awe.

My first night leg was perfect straight for 4.4 miles. After obsessing over the current pace for the first half mile or so, I fixated on an orange lamp in the distance that utterly failed to get any closer. As the road seemed to stretch ever on and on, I was content because I knew I simply had to keep moving. I finished with a pace of 7:05, and sometime on this leg Friday turned to Saturday.

Night legs’ in-between times are odd. There is not as much to see

It was around 1 a.m. when we really started to pass other teams. In fact, red light in front of me on the trail. I got to chase this light for about three miles. Much like the lamppost from earlier legs this light stayed resolutely in front of me despite my efforts to close the gap. When I finally did, I must have been averaging 1.5-2 minutes/mile faster than him. My pace for this 5.2 mile leg was 6:57.
I felt alright after my last night leg, but food was entirely unappealing. I wanted to find a soft patch of anything and just sleep. I wasn’t so sure I could make it. I kept trying to nap, but struggled to doze. I was hungry but didn’t have an appetite. My body was rebelling against me. On the other hand, my legs felt pretty much OK, with a pretty standard sort of deep (but mild) fatigue. Nothing was burning or felt like it had ripped and I hadn’t cramped up at all. So on this I was optimistic.

Despite having 42 miles of rest and preparation, so the deck was stacked in my favor environmentally in most ways at least. At about 5 miles in, my team finally arrived to provide some support. At miles five and seven I had some water at least – it felt like my cramps could come back at almost any moment. I kept getting faster as the leg went on and even though I added an extra furlong or so, I managed to finish with a 6:57 pace for 8.9 miles. I felt on top of the world after that leg.

I felt like crap 20 minutes later. It was the same as the early morning doldrums

The heat struck a teammate down. He finished his fifth leg and was barely coherent for several minutes. We got him cooled and he reiterated the fact that he was done. It was only 10 a.m. but the heat must have already been above eighty. We still had about 40 miles to run. Everyone was slowing down
the best.

My last leg was hot. It was six miles through Stuart. I felt OK and kept moving with a pace in the high 7s, hit a bridge (which sucked) and missed a turn. Of course, I didn’t know I missed the turn. I ended up running/walking an extra 3.5 miles because of it. I tried borrowing phones to get in touch, but it wasn’t working out. It was then that I realized I had arrived at the destination my first leg graffiti had alluded to – I was in hell. I managed to retrace my steps and ran into the team van. I cost the team 45 minutes.

- How ridiculous is it for my goal to be total victory?  The winning time last year was 1:17:04 and I honestly think I can beat that with enough training.  Thoughts?

- How far should my maximum runs be?  My long runs have been around 14 miles max so far (in ~2 hrs) and I'm thinking I'll go farther over the next few weeks...is this overkill?

- What should my mix of speed to distance be?  So far I've been taking an easy run about every other day when I need to recover

- Also

- Strength training.  I've been weightlifting as well, and calf raises; generally at fairly high weight for low reps.  This makes me incredibly sore the next couple days I run.  Should I back off on this?  I feel that if it hurts this much it's got to be doing something for me, but maybe I should concentrate more on the running...

1374881196.0,1j4ohz,Long Term Injury Seeking Any Advice Possible,akolesar,2,0,18,"So, but it simply will not leave completely. 

Let me start off. I am a collegiate runner for an NCAA division 2 atlantic school. I start my sophomore year in about a month. I had a great opening xc season last year

Come winter I started running exclusively roads for the winter training because of the snow

So I took some time off, it showed a bony prominence on my tibia, showing there is surely a stress reaction. I chose not to get an MRI to diagnose a stress fracture as both injuries would be treated in a similiar way. 

So I gave the word to red shirt indoor track, class and food. By this time about 2-3 months have passed since I got this injury, and it is not nearly as painful, but it is always there, and that is much of the focus of this post. So I'm left with this dull feeling resembling an ache in my tibia, it is no longer painful but still there, and I know that if I were to start running again

Trying to solve this issue I booted my leg for 3 weeks with minimal improvement. I got a second opinion from my home orthopedist who did a wrist surgery for me in the past and he agreed with the original doctor's finding. Around this time I'd also been using a bone stimulator that I had leftover from a previous injury

So the spring semester ended and I still had this stupid dull feeling in my leg that I knew was a remnant of this injury. At the start of this summer I started getting desperate. I paid a fair amount out of pocket to see a professional athletic trainer for a major sports team. He gave me a lot of helpful insight as to why the injury occured(form work, and it was his opinion that rehabilitation exercises were my best option of recovery. Getting a plan made from my trainer at school, I started that routine more than a month ago, and it has not helped much to this point. 

So my current situation is that I am red shirting this fall's cross country season. If the season ends with me still struggling I'll have spent nearly a year with this injury. If it comes to that point I'm considering leaving the sport of running or taking a long hiatus. 

Some other important things I feel I have left out:

I drink plenty of milk

I have custom fit orthotics

I change my shoes regularly

I rehab 2-3x weekly

 I have seen 2 doctors and 2 athletic trainers for this injury

Alcohol

So Please! any advice at all is welcomed. Running used to be such a big part of my life and it really sucks that it is gone.

**Important questions/info in bold:** 

So Its been what 29 days since my last post here?

Last thursday we had a mock meet and it seems I had ran the 400m in about 52-53s (which is about a 2-3 second drop since 3-4 weeks ago)

Yesterday was my first meet of the season and was scheduled to run the 400m

**400m time -** low 55s (thought was faster but i felt very tight due to it being very cold yesterday in florida..weird weather)

**200m time -** 24s (I could have went way faster but I was whining in my head I gotta run the 4x4 i can't be tired and i am tired from the previous 400m it was a meet with only about 5 teams so the meet went by quick + i was freezing at the starting line)

**4x4 split - mid 53s -** i was second leg and got the baton right as the another team got the baton

Todays practice was pretty sucky we just did 4 200's (then lifted) at about 80% pace and I just felt very.. ""heavy"" from yesterdays meet but it being 80% and i didn't have my spikes on it doesn't phase me.

I know my 200m time is AT LEAST 23s probably low 22s or even high 21s my coach thinks I will hit 49s by the end of the season

Also we had done a few practice 4x1 relays and fun 4x2 relays having me race the fastest guy on our team and I would get the baton later then him

**Injury question that has been bugging me:** My right achilles heel has been bothering me since friday

Do I ignore it? What should I do? I heard achilles problems are very big and the pain is at the heel..but a little above it

**Also so do people sprint without their spikes and should i buy sprinting spikes?** 

I have this mentality that I can only sprint fast and well with my spikes on

**Any advice for running the 400m?**

 I think the toughest part for me is after the 1st 200m. I either run so hard for the first 300m

***Thanks for everyone always responding to my questions and whoever enjoys reading my progress! I will be racing this Saturday in order to be qualified for the UNF invitational my coach wants me to run the 400m there, and we'll give the 800 a shot later on in the season.******",,False,self,t5_2t1rd,False,,

Back in highschool I was doing the 1 and 2 mile double. The mile was first and I completely blew up. I ran about 15 seconds slower than my pr. I was pretty mad about that but I shook it off because I was seeded 3rd and i thought i stood a chance to win. 

So the 2 mile starts the number 1
We hit the one mile mark at 5:10.

I decided to take the lead from here. Within the first lap of the second mile number 2 had dropped off and it was just me and number one. I started to throw in surge after surge through the whole second mile. And after every one it took him a little bit longer to get back to me.

The best part of this race was the size of the crowd. The throwing coach on my team always made of point of forcing everyone to be there to support the two milers. Add that to the fact that it was a home meet and you've got all the parents. On top of that we needed these points to pull of the team win.

So when i finally took the bell everyone was up on their feet. My whole team was going nuts. The guy was right behind me and he still hadn't given up. As we came around the corner to 300m to go he tried to come around the outside of me and i reacted immediately. I sprinted so hard for that last 300 i thought i was going to vomit. I ended up putting him into the ground. I finished with about a 25m lead on him. My second mile came through at 5:08.

I'll never forget the feeling of a home crowd roar underneath the lights. I've raced faster times in college and I won a few others. But that feeling was so special others never compared.

So that's my story. And i would lover to hear other people's biggest moments. Sorry if it was long but I didn't want to miss any details.

1332466548.0,r9b22,Training Advice &amp; Willpower Questions,Epicureanist,4,3,13,"Hi first post here. 

**Background:** I'm currently a sophomore in highschool (only about 7 weeks of school left) in my third or so week of track. I've never been on a team or done a sport before and began running June 2011 (c25k). 

Body:
5'6 139 lbs 

My PR'S from time trials we had during practice (first time running both):
2:45 - 800m
6:26 - 1600m/mile

They're average to bad

I want to improve as much as possible from now to 
Anyway here are my questions:

**1. What's the fastest way for me to improve my mile and 800 time?**

**2. How to improve my willpower/self-discipline when running?**. 

I've realized that my body can take a crapload the problem is after a lap or two of sprinting I want to quit. I'm used to this feeling (especially on continuous runs) and normally fight through it and push myself. 

When I ran the mile and 800 (specifically 800) the feeling came after 2 laps (on the mile) and the 2nd lap of the 800. **I sprinted at the end of both the mile and 800 and realized after a few minutes of rest

**3. Any general training advice?**

A normal track practice consists of 

* Very light 800m warmup 5 mins &amp; stretching
* Continuous runs (Normally about 40, or 35 mins depending on day) 
* Strides
* Abs (twice a weak)

about 2hours of practice everyday. Is there anything more I can do? Body weight exercises or anything that can improve my run?

EDIT: thank you all so much for the responses. It might be hard to express online

One more thing on my mind:

I'm considering starting to lift weights (both upper and lower body). Would that negatively affect my running at all? I've searched online but gotten mixed results.",self,t5_2t1rd,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/r9b22/training_advice_willpower_questions/

I was running in the rain one day and slipped on a storm drain while turning and landed pretty hard on my hip. I kept running and wrote it off since it didn't hurt while I was running. I kept running on that for a week or two before my hips and back started to hurt. I went to a trainer at my school's gym and he said I had misplaced my hip

I ran light on the injury for a couple weeks then did a half which I had signed up for way earlier in the year. It was probably a mistake but I had around a month of afterwards for vacation.

I finished my second full in March. I made my goal time, except for a couple intervals. The race went extremely well - my HR was steady, low, and my splits were even, so I at least trained and tapered well for it. 

Out of marathon training, and have back off on a week where I ran too fast for my own good. I've have heard from a few folks this plan doesn't work well for my base, and with limited mileage would struggle in fulls. I do like the runs, but do want at least a 4th day of running, even if its a quick recovery / form practice run. 

My goals are getting really divergent and I need some help trying to balance them. I'd like to hammer a a sub20 5k, and I'd like to try those without disrupting a training week. 

Another subgoal is to slowly build up to some triathlons. I need to get on a bike or swim twice a week

In terms of a plan, I am not looking to PR that run :p

If this is the wrong thread for these questions let me know -- I just see a lot of speed goals and training tidbits in here.

It's 11.22km long (or 6.97178 miles). It's gonna be hot. I've trained for cross country and track out in this heat for nearly 10 years now. 2 months ago

**I want to get fast**

I have access to a track, along with long flat expanses. *What I need advice on:* Speeeeed! I want to go out and destroy some people. I have a decent base and base mileage is always very easy for me to add on/deal with, etc. I have newer shoes, and am ready to go.

So I've been getting some achilles tendonitis on and off for about a year now, then come back, cyclically. One of the problems is that I have to stop running, or at least slow down significantly for it to heal. I've tried all sorts of things and I feel like I do everything properly (excellent diet, 8+ hours sleep every night, run with HRM at MAF pace, etc)

So I'm considering getting a road bike. The bike would cost about 1300 bucks after getting shoes/pedals/helmet and of course the bike. It would allow me to maintain my aerobic system now

Or would I be better off just throwing some money at a gym pass?
