1357861841.0,16cgdi,A 10-rule guide for interacting with INTP's that I wrote a few years ago,floralmuse,166,16,68,"This was on a blog that I stopped writing a long time ago, I think I would approach a few subjects differently but I posted it as it was originally. 

1. Just because they didn't hear you doesn't mean they aren't interested. We daydream a lot
2. Don't force them to share their feelings. For introverts, feel flattered if they decide to share with you.
3. Don't say they are over-analyzing or ""thinking too much"". We are not over-analyzing. You are under-analyzing. We are by nature very analytical and critical. This is how we understand the world
4. Do back up your rules with logic. While INTP's can have problems with authority, this may mean taking the time to explain your rationale in detail. Our weak point is logic. Back up your rules with evidence and explanations instead of ""Because I said so"" if you want them respected.
5. Don't expect them to do anything the conventional way. We will almost always test the rules and boundaries of the method, sometimes it's better to just let us go (you never know, we might actually find a better way).
6. Don't push them too far. While we are generally amiable
7. Don't get offended by debate. We love to debate and discuss, but often offend those who are more sensitive. We really don't mean to! In fact by debating or playing devil's advocate to your ideas we are often testing their soundness because we are impressed by (or at least curious about) them. If we thought they were crap we probably wouldn't bother. If you feel somewhat assaulted, but they are still acting hunky-dorey, chances are they didn't mean anything by it.
8. Don't expect them to blend in. We are often unconventional, you should know that they probably don't care. Remember Einstein's crazy hair?
9. Do give them something complicated to do. We thrive on complexity, keep in mind that while your lil possibly INTP may have average grades in school, they may very well be exceptionally gifted when given the opportunity to work ""outside the box"" on something they are interested in.
10. Don't mistake fair for cold-hearted. If you ever find yourself under the authority of an INTP, solid reasons why you need or deserve it rather than try to make them feel sympathy, empathy or guilt.

You're scared of the dark?  Don't ask if ""we"" are afraid of the dark -- I'm quite sure you are.  Instead, too, that its inception is too complicated to analyze.  In any case, casting a net into the INTP community in a delusional quest for confirmation won't tell you much.  If a lot of people share your fear, this similarity might be related to the others.

To the rest of us, ""Meh I wouldn't enjoy their company anyway"", in those situations we should admit to ourselves we're upset, humble ourselves, and I promise you'll be happier for it. In other words. I know some times its easy to reach for the nearest negative thought but **please stay positive**.

Life is uneven. For us INTPs we struggle more than most of the other personality types to get past that barrier of entry. A struggle which isn't very visible to others. Being excitable is something we're generally not

I know some times we all feel like we're off in La-La Land with our ambivalent thoughts, or even one day a week if you need it to get all the negativity out alone, and then remember all the good things in your life, and if you can't, look harder.

There are many more things I would like to say but that's the main brunt of things. Life isn't easy, I've spent more than enough time without one.

1357485197.0,16294k,INTP love success story!,Adventurenox,80,5,25,"I’ve been reading some posts and comments that make me think that many INTP’s here are disheartened about their prospects for finding relationship bliss.  I consider myself a success in this area

I’m happily married with a child, deeply committed, and deeply happy.      

I met my wife when we were nine years old, was always about finding a partner for my life.  I'd broken up with my previous girlfriend the moment I decided that I didn't want to spend the rest of my life with her.  Logically, I didn't see the point in continuing a relationship for the sake of physical gratification, when it meant giving up further opportunities to find a good match. When my wife and I started dating, it was very different.  

First things first, for a school dress up day, she wore a tight dress.  I then saw that she had and has a incredible body, but had hid it out of modesty.  Until that moment I had seen her as a mousey, geeky kind of person, and this brings me to life lessons number one, two

1)  Looks matter, and I think it's silly to attempt to fight that.  

2) Dress for success, as a human with all our quirky brain wiring, had missed it because of this.  While, I later learned, my own fashion sense (I was a alt-rock dandy at the time) had caught her attention some time before I noticed her.  I've read that INTP's can either be nearly obsessive about their appearance, or completely disregard it as immaterial.  I vacillate between the two, but I strongly suggest the former for work / dating encounters - research the halo effect if you doubt its value.  

3) Smart women get better looking with age, observation, and cultural stereotypes.  Personal experience?  We've been together for nearly fifteen years, and I think it would flatter her to know that she's hotter now than at 17.  I've seen this effect with other women of my cohort, as well as in other aspects of my life.  Many of the hot ditzes from highschool have since put on a lot of weight, or are still trying to cling to youth in a unseemly way.  Cultural stereotypes are often drawn on real patterns, so ask yourself who is more attractive as a stereotype: the bronzed 50-something gold digger type, as I age, I don't know if this is true for both genders

When our relationship began, though because of our age, we waited to announce it.  When we went to university we lived together as man and wife for a year (a sensible tradition called hand-fasting) and then married.  

Now for some relationship advice drawn strictly from personal experience.  

1) Combine all your finances, and likewise she has supported me.  There isn’t, nor has there ever been, any my money vs. her money.  Spending decisions are made together and it is never a battle between us.  This allows me to bring logic to the decisions before the fact rather than having to bring it to the fight after.  

2) Your partner will not properly hear you.  As an INTP I pick my words very carefully and strive to say only what I mean and exactly what I mean.  My wife’s emotions sometimes seem directly connected to her ears and create a massive distortion field around what I say.  Don’t take this personally, including yourself can mis-hear a statement.  Explain how the misunderstanding made you feel - this is hard for me, but it’s better than arguing about who said what.  

3) Do nice things for your partner, buy emergency gifts.  I always have one or two items hidden away, not for when I’m in trouble - never try to buy your way out of a conflict - but for those moments when I want to do something nice, but I can’t or don’t want to go out.  As long as these items are purchased or made from genuine affection, I don’t think it’s disingenuous to hold them in reserve.  

4) Sex, but by base physical desires.  Everyone has these desires, and it’s much more satisfying to have them serviced by someone else.  More emotional people, I think, build sex up into something more than this - which isn’t a problem.  Be there for your partner and don’t treat it as a mercenary act.  Have fun, make it fun.  Logically, it needs to be done

5)  Find an emotional release.  We like to think we don’t have emotions

6) Communicate.  Communicate a lot.  You’ll often be able to guess what your partner is thinking, is something bothering you?”  Her:  “Maybe, I don’t know.”  Me:  “Were you hurt by what your mother said?”  Then she gives me a look that asks: How do I always know?  This also shows how much you care to have noticed.

Finally, but learn a bit of the jargon so you can talk about it - I find that once I’ve done this, I start to become really interested.  There is literally nothing in this world that I can’t find interesting when approached in the right way - and voila! we’ve grown together.  This quickly becomes reciprocal as they develop interests in your interests.

My wife, you want others to be happy in love too.”

1361910297.0,19a1wo,Academic Failure,MrQ82,80,9,53,"TL/DR: Has anyone else struggled academically to the point of dropping out of university.  Did you go back?

I guess I should give you some backstory.  I've never been a great student.  I think in my younger years because of social and familial pressure I was heavily involved in sports and my sense of identity and self esteem became heavily attached to being an athlete.  But I think this hindered me more than anything.  I am naturally an introverted and cerebral person but I was able to blend in among jocks and stoners etc. in high school.  I was always able to pull off straights B's without ever doing homework just by paying attention in class and being a good test-taker.  

This carried over into university where I studied political science and avoided taking courses with major essays etc.  I had A's in 1st year then each semester after I became increasingly bored with my studies and began to almost skirt disaster by seeing how well I could do while completing as minimal work as possible.  Being forced to take courses with major essay components resulted in massive stress and anxiety for me and i started failing because the procrastination became debilitating and I became depressed about  how poorly I was doing and the money I was wasting. 

I realize how incredibly immature my procrastination and attitude towards school was.  I guess it was a holdover from my earlier school experiences where homework was just some arbritrary task forced on me by some authority that only served the purpose of occupying my mind when I would rather be exploring more interesting and stimulating intellectual pursuits.  

Eventually I dropped out of university and worked several dead-end jobs for a couple years. But in those years  I read like a fiend and delved into all sorts of subjects I wanted to know more about.  I took classes in creative writing to get over my fear of writing.  Ideas and art stimulate me.  I want to succeed and have a respectable career.  But not having a university degree has felt like this unfinished burden on my back and is preventing me from any kind of job that involves some of my intellectual interests(psychology

So now I find myself at 30, trying to take some courses to improve my gpa so I can transfer to a university, and finally finish my degree.  I'm really in a bind financially in terms of whether I can even get a loan for the next couple years.  

Before I enrolled at the college I was super motivated and excited to be studying something I'm interested in and be on a path to finishing my education.  However

Sorry for the depressing and long sob-story but I feel like I'm in a rut and painted myself into a corner in life.  I can't really relate my story to friends and family.  Life seems so much simpler to other people.  Any advice from fellow INTPs would be extremely helpful.

The youngest are in their teens (we have classes for future students) and the oldest are well into their 70s. I am shocked at how fundamentally different we are at different ages. The teen INTPs are to be honest awkward and socially not well adapted. It seems like many of them go through a transformation in their 20s and become a lot more social and cool. 

The most amazing ones are the very old INTPs. Some of them have very well developed Fe and often they seem like super logical ENFJs. From my observation INTPs seem to get very warm with age. 

I am also struck by how late many of the INTPs are. Many of us seem to be years behind their peers when it comes to social development but seem to catch sometime in their 20s. For example many INTPs regularly go to parties but they only started doing so many years after their peers started to go to parties. Another example is dating. Many of the INTPs I meet have a relationship and are able to date attractive mates but many seem to have lost their virginity when they where older than their peers and also where older than others when they started dating.

It seems like INTPs develop just as much socially as everyone else but do it at a greatly reduced speed Also INTPs change more than other types. It seems like the difference between a 18 year old INTP and a 30 year old INTP is greater than it would be for many other personality types.

1357793250.0,16ap01,"""The Secret Lives of INTPs"" - By Anna Moss",ShotgunzAreUs,57,3,61,"**Part 1**

I bought this book shortly after [this](http://www.reddit.com/tb/168w2r) threat was posted. It is a $4.99 digital download if anyone is interested in purchasing it. I will hit on all the highlights of the book and anything else seemingly of interest through my own wording and quotes from the author
""Are you ready to absorb raw information?""

The author opens the book by explaining that while she did research all the information that she could on INTPs

""INTPs are curious about many things—not least of which are themselves."" Being an INTP herself the author shows through understanding that while should doesn't have a $850 license she does comprehend what it means to be INTP and the implications of such a diagnosis. She gets to the, we can be so content with our own thoughts and ideas it is entirely appropriate to say we ""...are often content to observe without participating."" Something I notice about myself far too often. It's not all sunshine and rainbows though: ""INTPs are one of the most absentminded types, rivalled perhaps only by the INFP."" She follows through making a reference to the comedic ""grey-haired 
professor with his head in the clouds and his nose in a book."" A comparison as justified as any comparison could hope to be.

After the general descriptions are completed the next matter in place is that of our ""sick"" sense of humor, to know I am one of a relatively small number of people on Earth who could appreciate some of the jokes I make. She also makes a point I remember seeing made on this subreddit at some point: ""...some INTPs report that they keep all the hilarity contained in their heads; outsiders see nothing but a vaguely bemused expression or perhaps a smirk, if anything at all."" It is something I wonder every time I see someone grin and chuckle to themselves in the corner of an otherwise silent classroom. Could this one be as far in his head as I am? “...few men possessed so rich a flow of language, [or] so great
a fund of amusing anecdotes
well-told.” &lt;- I am unsure who stated this

Ah, simply because they are not the norm. This leads to a ""gag reflex"" for the opposing individual, so they view our point as absurd. The author uses quite an effective example to explain our use of the Socratic method. Sadly, it is too large to fit in the post so I will post it in a comment as ""Note #1.""

And this is where I break.  
**Part 2**  

Moss does not fail to mention the INTPs search for absolute or ""pure"" truth
their opponent."" Once the trap is set the INTP only needs to wait for their opponent to agree with them before clamming and locking the door behind them. See Notes #2A and #2B. Another point that comes to mind (that was mentioned in the book, you’re the one who said that. All I said was that...” a situation I have actually found myself in several times today. Unlike the majority of the human race (even, and maybe even especially, here in the United States) INTPs are very precise in the word choice and diction, carefully choosing the proper weight and meaning of every word they use and insuring it is absolutely appropriate for the given situation. INTPs have it both ways when it come to composing thought into language. INTPs can have a hard time of thinking of how to word a statement at all, at it can take quite some time to organize the purely abstract concept into language. But we are also gifted with spectacular diction and ability to form complex language. As a matter of fact, many arguments would be avoided altogether if the terms of the discussion would have been agreed and defined correctly beforehand. See Note #3. And like most serious matters, right and wrong
**Part 3**

The end of page 21 (of 247
Intuitives are more engaged in politics than Sensors.  
Intuition is linked with a liberal stance
TJ is associated with the American Republican Party
Democrats are associated with FP.  
""Political Alienation"" (discontent or disconnection) is connected with Introversion.  
Thinkers oppose Feelers on the death penalty

Here comes the sections dedicated to Religion and Church. While INTPs have the highest rates of both Agnostics and Atheists, meditation, study, and reading, with attractions to remote hermitages and monasteries with a rule of silence. Continuing the pattern of logical consistency INTPs seem to be drawn to theology and proper doctrine. ""INTPs, however, were the type least likely (20.2%) to use 'rely on religious beliefs' as a coping method for stress. Considering that most INTPs believe in a higher spiritual power
**Part 4**  

Most religious organizations are led by extraverts, is an INTP likely to be enthusiastic when the EFJ pastor says cheerfully, “Okay, 
everybody! Stand up and give your neighbor a hug!”?"" I'll let you answer that
After the sections regarding Church and Church Culture there is one on Cults and how they reform their member's personality types. [Here](http://www.pureheartvision.org/resources/docs/yeakley/The%20Discipling%20Dilemma.pdf) is an included (as a link anyway) PDF file that goes into much greater depth than the book.  
Introducing, it take considerable mental power to do the processing and form the thoughts that we are known for. Who is to say that work of the mind is less important or less exerting that work of the hand? After all, without your brain your hand hasn't much to do. Through all this effort others may never give a sign of doing anything at all, unless an observer catches a glance of ""...a bead of saliva gliding down the corner of the INTP’s mouth, provided that the INTP can be seen behind the cover of their book."" See Note #4.  
**Part 5**

INTPs (and to a lesser extent ISTPs) have been found to be the most active casual inventors

The next section deals in our favorite subject, they learn to fit in through conscious observation and deliberate mimicry.  While other people talk, the INTP watches and wonders, “Am I nodding too often?  Should I speak up, or remain silent? Should I fold my arms, put my hands in my pockets, or try to gesture?  Should I touch this person in a friendly
should I laugh?  How close should I stand?” Through necessity we play roles much like an actor on a stage in order to be accepted. Not for the sake of acceptance, would taking acting classes make INTPs better at their game of mimicry? I actually have a rather insignificant amount of trainer as an actor and I can confidently say that every little bit helps and is surprisingly noticeable. Just something to think about. I will let the author handle the section covering small talk:  
""Since INTPs are not terribly interested in the everyday details of other people’s lives
a poor recall for names
when people begin to discuss the boring stuff
With practice
while internally wondering whether dolphins have language or thinking about how Star Wars breaks 
the laws of physics.  They do not intercept half the personal information poured upon them
easily forget what they do hear because they find it rather uninteresting.  
A popular ice breaking activity has each person in a group share their name and a personal detail about 
themselves.  (INTPs don’t like sharing personal details about themselves
exercise help the INTP get to know the rest of the group? No. Shortly after the exercise is over
will wipe every name and personal detail from their brain.""  
**Part 6**

Now for something I am known for, or ""Death Glare."" ""This facial expression is actually not a glare, but the INT’s neutral face. The mistaken effect of a glare is produced by unbroken direct eye contact, prolonged silence, and an utterly impassive face. The Death Glare may also be mistaken for depression."" People tend to assume the negative when someones face is utterly unfeatured, comprised of no emotion. Not only do they assume negatively about the INTPs emotional state, but also their thoughts, possibly because they feel as though no emotion is as bad as negative emotion,,

I've read from several sources that INTPs tend to have addictions.  A culmination of the texts I've read and my own personal insights seem to suggest that it's a way to escape the ""INTP-ness"" of our brains.

I read *somewhere* that INTPs are prone to cigarette smoking.  Personally

I've tried to replace this addiction with exercise, critical thinking about exactly what I'm doing to myself, etc. and while it helps a little, it does not discourage my eventual use.  Even using nicotine gum, lozenge, patch or snus does not placate my addiction.

Research suggests that persons with mental illness are more prone to addiction and smoking cigarettes

I have also found in recent years that ingesting cannabis daily makes me feel more...""together"" - I guess, it has come to the point where taking a tolerance break turns me into someone I do not want to be - sober me cannot make the connection to finding those things that cannabis brings out in me.  So, I guess, that's ""addiction"".

Years of therapy and every medication under the sun has done very little for sober me.  Substance abuse counseling does nothing.  Critically thinking does nothing.  CBT does nothing.  Retreats do nothing.  The only answer I have for my addictions is that I cannot mentally handle being ""me"".  The INTP brain I possess is either the root of my problems or exacerbates them.  

I have to learn to deal with having INTP personality traits and I don't have the wisdom

If you have an addiction - be it a classic vice or hell, porn - why do you think you do it?  Is it because it is the only way you have found to deal with being yourself?  Do you think it's a genetic predisposition?  Do you just like it and couldn't give any fucks as to why you do it?

About me: I have a masters in math and teach pre-cal/calc at a community college. I hesitate to call myself even an amateur mathematician.

TL;DR: The incompleteness theorem shows that in a formal axiomatic system of sufficient richness

**Some Context** 

Most of the misuse of the Incompleteness Theorem (IT) stems from a misunderstanding of what mathematicians do. Most people only encounter math in their science and math classrooms and get the impression that math is all about describing natural gas laws and finding the derivative of f(x) at x = 2 and such. This is to what mathematicians do as learning to drive is to what automotive engineers do (or

Mathematicians are in the business of proving things. The tools you use in the classroom are taught and used with confindence because they have been proven to work. I don't mean proved in the way that you might prove to a kid on the playground that you can spit ten feet

Mathematicians operate under a couple fundamental assumptions:

*everything in math happens for a reason*

*every well-formed mathematical statement is either true or false*

Under these assumptions

You may be wondering how such a story is written. How far back do you go? In any mathematical context, implicitly, has the addendum ""assuming some particular set of axioms."" [Euclid's Elements](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements) is *the* classic about how axiomatic systems give rise to complex truths.

In a sense, is a combination and rearrangement of axioms until you get the desired statement.

**Some History**

In the early 20th century

Their goal was to formalize all of mathematics into a symbolic system so that the truth of any mathematical statement could in principle be determined by checking if it was a permutation of the fundamental axioms. Such a formal system would end mathematician's jobs in theory

Such a system was desired to have 2 properties:

1) It must be *consistent*. A consistent system contains no statements such that both the statement and its negation are provable by extension of its axioms; in other words the axioms don't contradict themselves. A system that is inconsistent is useless.

2) It should be *complete*. In a complete system

[Principia Mathematica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica) was the most serious effort to produce a consistent formal axiomatic system to capture all mathematics in a *complete* manner. The structure of Principia was designed to avoid paradoxes as well

If this effort were successful

**The Incompleteness Theorem**

What Godel did was very cleverly construct a statement within the Principia framework that had to be true but could not be proven by the axioms of Principia. Thus he showed that Principia could not be *complete* and thus the ""Incompleteness Theorem.""

The way he did this was constructive in that the method could be applied to any formal axiomatic system that can capture the behavior of whole numbers.

A brief outline of his method:

Godel used a coding system whereby the symbols of a formal axiomatic system could be encoded into integers as exponents on the prime numbers.

For example:

2^3* 3^7* 5^2 could be translated as ""the 3rd symbol in the system followed by the 7th symbol in the translation followed by the 2nd symbol in the translation."" The first prime (2) gives which symbol comes first

2^3* 3^7* 5^2 can also be interpretted directly as 437300.

Thus he could encode statements about whole numbers into whole numbers.

By doing this he was able to construct a statement equivalent to ""This statement cannot be proved.""

Then there are 2 things that can happen:

1) The statement can be proved

2) The statement cannot be proved and the system is incomplete.

Thus any formal axiomatic system rich enough to describe the integers must be incomplete.

**Conclusions**

First of all: The incompleteness theorem is a statement *about axiomatic systems*. If you are not talking about axiomatic systems

More broadly: The quest to find a fundamental set of axioms for mathematics was proven to be a wasted effort. (Sorry

Since the incompleteness theorem

To ponder:

What the ""territory"" is exactly when dealing with mathematics if axiomatic systems are the ""maps"" we use?

What is the relationship between formal reasoning and bursts of creative mathematical intuition that have guided math's development?

First, the majority of the population thinks the opposite and we are constantly regarded as weird, aloof, eccentric etc. I could go on and on about this but I know you INTP's have felt like the alien before. We are extremely misunderstood by our peers.

So what is an INTP to do? **Embrace your strengths!** Although life is difficult for us

INTP's are logical, curious and big-picture oriented. None of these qualities are valued at a job that doesn't require a PhD. In fact, our dominant qualities are often looked at in contempt by companies, as many are simply looking for sheep to keep the wheels turning. 

So here is what happens to an INTP. We find a job -- it's like most jobs, people around us sense it and -- even more than usual -- distance themselves from us. Rinse and repeat for the majority of the INTP's life, and it's not hard to see why we can be such downers.


**BUT FUCK THAT!** Fuck all that nonsense INTP brethren -- we kick ass and take names

We are capable of absolutely brilliant insight. 

We can process ridiculous amounts of information at an incredible speed. 

We have a pervading sense of social justice. 

We are objective and therefore accepting 

We are kind


Don't settle for society's bullshit INTP's. Yeah our room is messy, and you should never give up trying to find what makes you happy. When you do find your spot in the universe, you will produce works of brilliance, absolute brilliance. Yes it's an uphill battle, but the view from the top is beautiful.

Anyway

Anecdata that might help:

- We have frequent, but not quite enough to be boring. We lose track of time talking to each other every time we're able to get into a serious conversation (we work together). We've taken a couple of afternoons off just to talk to each other, and our conversations are almost always serious and important-feeling.

- I see him looking at me out of the corner of his eye fairly frequently, but that's just me and it's impossible to tell what other people are feeling so that isn't a very valuable data point. 

- He seems to cycle between hot/cold with me - some days we act like we've been best friends forever

- He isn't super into the whole INTP thing, much less women. 

- We're both super smart and he always acts really bashful when I compliment him or say ""brilliant!"" to a good idea he has or anything like that. This seems pretty normal but he seems to do it to a greater extent when I say anything than when anybody else says something.

- He's super-serious with me - he jokes around with most of the other people in our team

- We teach each other stuff all the time. He's an ornithologist and I'm a landscape ecologist, sharing all of this super-interesting stuff with each other just makes me feel unbelievably romantic towards him (though I'm not sure if he feels the same way). 

Anyway, and that I'm certainly presenting things in a super-biased way because I'm half in love with him already, but I would love to hear your thoughts regardless. Cheers, fellow INTPs!



**UPDATED**:
(moved my update up here from a late-breaking comment):

Okay, that he was really super focused on work and thought it would be best if he didn't focus on anything else (he's in the middle of his masters field season for the project we're working on right now, and he has about a million other things to do too so he's not just making it up). I pressed him a little on whether it was really JUST work or if he really wasn't interested, and he said ""a little of both"" - so I assume he just wanted to let me down easy and simply isn't interested. It's been fairly awkward between us since then but things should go back to normal soon - hell, we're both INTPs, right? Christ knows we can always talk about work if need be.

On some level, freewheeling conversation about what masculinity and gender roles mean, his cultural baggage with respect to New Englander emotional avoidance &amp; repression, etc etc).

1348188904.0,1082r1,Not having wants,ruorgimorphu,42,6,39,"Hi INTPs!

A life problem that I'm having is described in the title.  Since I don't seem to want anything in particular, I'd like to follow my dreams, but I don't have any.  The best dream that I can muster is that I'd like to be a very knowledgeable person in all sciences including psychology, philosophy, and I also care about music and its history, and indeed to know whatever other knowledge of worth comes my way.  I also want to be a social person at a basic level, and I'd also like to be a loving person.  

My current field is physics/programming, and hopefully the work in that field turns my crank enough (and also that I can get it).  Note that the dream above involves very little in the way of providing for others concretely, it really is just about my own knowledge.  Medical physics sounds like a way cool career but it's still hard for me to drive myself.  I've found that I have to surrender a fair bit of my dream in order to fit into society.  I also have to work pretty hard to accomplish this dream.  Also keep in mind how fleeting it is, that picture of myself only came to me on one day, and ever since I've just latched onto it in an effort to know what I want in life so I can have some purpose towards something.

I've actually made a lot of progress with this problem but I'd still like to hear your tips and thoughts, grow, and really let the identity I choose/find in myself drive my actions and effect on the world.  (I found that reading The Outsider by Colin Wilson.)  But even with that knowledge, I find that I'm really slow at doing anything because my want for it to be done is so little, even if it's a completely selfish thing that furthers my strongest desires.  

By the way, active in some way.  I do interact with people but it needs to be in a more core kind of way.  I also find that so far in life I've relied on external pressures to keep me going, and I sort of burnt out on that, mostly because I'm old enough for society to stop doing that to me.

I know this borders on nihilism and I'm really trying to claw myself out.  Maybe it'll be a lot easier when I actually enter an environment of what I want.  I manage enough self control to actually work on my life for most of the day every day, this is all so I can be a more effective person, which is driven out of the pursuit of happiness.  I'd really like to find more drive and passion.

Logic/maths:

**Godel Esher Bach** Systems and logic thinking. Talks about mathematics

**Mathemagics** Guide to mental math. Learn to square 3 digit numbers mentally. Written by this guy: www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4vqr3_ROIk&amp;t=65 and shows that the system taught in schools is inferior.

**Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance** Story following a man on a journey across america on a bike whilst sharing Chataquas. Argues that quality is the bridging link between art

**A beginners guide to deconstruction the Universe** The geometrical origin of numbers. Looks at fractals and has fun workshops where you get out a pen and paper and construct shapes. 

Self development

**Predictable Irrational** Could be logic but best used here. Looks at why we do our irrational choices in detail. 

**Moonwalking with einstein** Book on memory and how to improve it. Written by a jounalist who covered the US memory championships knowing nothing about it. Comes back a year later and wins it! Uses imagining a journey or place to place memories. You retake your journey and remember the interactions which are associated with information. Google will provide a better explanation.

**The Brain that changes itself** Neuroplasticity. Your mind is based in your brain

If a girl with half of the highest part of the brain removed can relearn to be a normal person so you would not notice anything if you spoke to her then what can you do with a (hopefully?) intact brain?

**The wisdom of insecurity** Buddhist concepts on awareness of the now put through a brutal logicalization.  This book will bitchslap your world view into a happier one. Don't let the taint of religion put you off. There is no way you can pull the sum total of his reasoning apart. Should be read by everyone

**Mindfulness in plain english** Works with the above book well. Plain english explanation on how to meditate. The author narrows in on a certain style of meditation but you can apply his concepts to all things. Google will let you know how beneficial meditation is.

**59 seconds** 59 second tips and tricks on how to do things, creative and all sorts. The author Dr Richard Wiseman must spend his time reading every sociology and psychology study he can find and making connections between things that cut straight through the bs. Very clever man with a very clearsighted view on the world.

**Awareness through movement** The original book the the feldenkrais method. Endorsed by the brain books author normon diodge. Re-structures your body image to be closer to what it is rather than a distorted perception. Improved sensory clarity

**The einstein factor** Based around a study that apparently proves a certain technique called image streaming boosts your IQ dramatically. Certainly increases your visualization skills but the study has yet to be published and the book was written years back. Nethertheless it has a good description of the feedback process. The most effective way we learn...

**48 laws of power** The laws that if followed make you socially invincable. Sociopaths wet dream. I can't say I instinctively use most of the techniques



**Books with descriptive titles**

* How to win friends and influence people.  (What it says on the tin)

* The rule book for arguements. (My stepdad would be pissed off at this book if he knew its contributions)

*Drawing on the right side of the brain (Learn to draw as you see!)

I highly recommend interacting with people in this manor if they are much different from yourself.  It makes you grow as a person.  I really like when I can observe people almost like research subjects and then learn from them.  Here is what my ESTP fuck buddy has actually said to me (paraphrased) and  taught me about life:

 
EDIT: the autoformat messed up the number sequence and I dont  knw how to fix it. :(  sorry.  

1. ""look, and endeavors?  That's not stress.  It's the feeling of being alive.  Get up off of your ass and just DO something. I love your brain but you think too much.""



2.""You're mistake is that you are trying to think during sex.  Don't think during sex.  Just feel and be aware of your body.  It's way better that way.  It's the same as indulging in amazing food.  Try to live in the present moment - this is one of the keys to life.  IF you have trouble with this, communicate etc.  Ask for what you want.  Ask what your partner wants.  Have fun.  I'm gonna fuck you like an animal later and then give you a big hug after.  Sorry, the cuddles are mandatory.   Put down that instructional book about sex. You dont need it.  Fuck the rules anyway.""  

3.  It's hard to explain but he takes weird risks but not dumb ones.  It has encouraged me to be a teensy bit more impulsive (in a good way) but I can't quite understand his attitude about certain things.  For example he said that when he was in university


4.  ""Its cool that you dont intend to have any kids ever.  Most women want kids.  It's better without them.  Kids are so much fun.  But you can't have an epic adventurous life with kids around.  You're doing ok so far with your adventurous life -not too bad.  You're a bit of a late bloomer though.  It's ok, no?  I mean I didnt' mean that smart women aren't awesome, because they are.  You know what I mean.""   (eh I listen to his babbling about 'fucking the system' and he tries to listen to my babbles about history, politics,  and philosophy) 


5.  ""Hey




It has been interesting and I have learned a lot so far.  I like when I can observe and learn a lot of things about life from my friends.  I love having lots of different friends who all have different types of personalities, that person would be like perfectly and awesomely well rounded and healthy :)

Perpetually aware of everything that is going on, we are in a constant need of understanding. It is our breath, it gives us purpose to life. Experiences, events, travel, they are all ways of diving into this rich depth of knowledge before us. We understand the necessity of absorbing everything, allowing ourselves to be sponges to the ocean of life. 

But what is this costing us as individuals? Where do we suffer as a consequence of this hunger for knowledge? It seems our personal relationships take a large hit, our map of knowledge is barren, and the desert sucks the very water out of our bodies. 

So how do we find this oasis in our minds? How are we able to connect, and yet it seems so far out of reach.  My heart is slowly being destroyed by my mind. We love our minds, but it is such a burden on our hearts. It takes so much out of us, and in its place puts so much pain. 

So we react to this pain, and that it will eventually fade. You use your mind, your knowledge, in order to understand it. But then it comes again, and it hurts to your very core. You feel it, and you fight it. And it comes again, but there it is. And your mind thinks of ways of understanding it, how can we live with our understanding of our mind and our emotions?

The times during my day in which my brain is not seriously focused on anything in particular (e.g. - driving, biking, sitting alone in my room, a lot of the day) I am usually thinking about philosophical ideas or trying to wrap my head around a new reality I've learned about the universe (quantum physics and things of that nature). And I love it. I often start philosophical discussions with my friends, and its a nightly conversation with my roommate.

After a while (a couple months) of this, because we are so meaningless, just not as happy/appreciative as I` could be).

This quickly leads me to being what I called ""clear headed."" My that I mean I live in a state where I'm not philosophizing between class or any other time of day in any significant amount. I feel like I'm just appreciating the moment.

This lasts for a couple weeks and then I'll be back to 'normal.' But its not just normal


Sorry for rambling.

Edit: I've come to decide (and the tests agree with it) that although I'm definitely an INTP

**Edit 2:** *(very interesting)*

 &gt;The Ne-Ti axis also leads to a curious duality in the thinking of the INTP. The dominant Ti core tends to assume the role of a controller and organizer of his life, with neither ever quite gaining the upper hand. He is not disturbed by this duality and can view it with wistful humour. If he has been free-spiriting for any length of time, he soon feels duty bound to analyze his behaviour and systematize it. While if he has been in an analytical mode for a while, he will soon decide that he can do what he wants freely after all. It is a yo-yo situation. Generally, INTPs have a very strong requirement to keep their external, social world as simple and as uncluttered as they can so that they can focus as much energy as possible on their internal world of system analysis and theorizing. Hence, they tend to be amongst the least demanding and least complicated of all types when interacting with others. They prefer to let the world flow by: to observe the waves being made by others, the Ne mode dominates

I never did well in school, and that I would eat their insides if I caught them.  My favorite boy to chase was my favorite because he retorted that he was a dirt-dauber wasp that ate spiders.  But he ran from me anyway because I was a girl.

The other little girls played together with their cute little dresses and…well, unless I noticed the upcoming picture day and told my mother about it.  Besides having the female plumbing, I may as well not have been a girl at all.

Other than entertaining little boys by pretending to be a tiny blonde predator, always thinking.  I wondered what happened after you died.  I wondered about God and Santa Claus and whether or not they existed.  I wondered if plants were aware of things around them like animals were.  When a cicada shed its horrific skin and left it on a tree trunk, did the tree know it was there?  I thought about the buildings I could build, if only I had thousands of Legos.  I didn’t, so I drew floor plans.  I invented useful things in my head as I fell asleep at night, only to discover later with great disappointment that someone else had already thought of it.

I did a lot of writing, and for them to catch a glimpse of it was to have them inside my head, the one place where I could deny them access.  By the time I was old enough to write, I had already learned that my thoughts were my own, and to share them would result in name-calling from children and bizarre looks from adults, coupled with commands to sit quietly and not disturb others.

My love of knowledge always seemed to backfire on me.  It’s difficult for me to remember specifics because a lot of memories that I blocked out when I was young have not yet returned

I was playing with a kitten in my front yard one summer afternoon, a couple of Native boys from down the street- scrawny kids in baggy tank tops and flip-flops and hair shaved off but for the tiny braids on the backs of their heads.  Startled at the newcomers, the kitten started to struggle, and I clutched it to my chest and tried to soothe it.

“You’re molesting it!” one boy yelled.  “Cat molester!” agreed the other, as the kitten squirmed free and disappeared under the tool shed.

“Mom, and I saw a strange look on her face from where I stood in the doorway.

“Where did you hear that word?” she asked.

“I heard one of the neighbor boys say it.”

She looked thoughtful for a moment

“Okay.”

“Go back outside.  Your feet are filthy.”  She reopened her book

A few days later

“Mo-om!  Mom, he’s molesting me!”  That caught their attention.  My parents’ initial shock turned instantly to fury.  

“What the fuck would you say that for?!?” screamed my father.

“You can’t talk like that!” my mother added.

“But…why not?  But it means attack!”

“I ever hear shit like that come out of your mouth again

I didn’t find out why I couldn’t use that word until I was eleven.

And that glimpse was just the surface life.  The public life.  The really awful things happened inside the house, hiccuping gasps to my closest friends, who I discovered were not really that close of friends at all, and I realized that I shouldn’t have trusted them so, nor let my grades slip just to spend time with them.  

After a few months, really- without some unpleasant detail of my past slipping out without my realizing it.  I can’t seem to quite get the knack of compartmentalizing myself in such a way as to only let out the socially acceptable bits without locking things away utterly and completely.  

My mind had a dark box of secrets for so long that, accept them so that I could move on with my life without that dark cloud of shame and fear hanging over me.  

That was great and all that jazz.  It really took a load off of my shoulders, I’ll realize that I can’t talk about that kind of thing in polite conversation, but it’s hard for me because I don’t think I ever totally figured out what qualifies as socially acceptable conversation in the first place.  I’m learning from my mistakes, but every time I make a mistake, it causes the people I’m trying to communicate with to shrink away from me.  It has made me hesitant to talk to anyone except in text format, where I have time to carefully craft my responses.

Is this why the only one I ever truly wanted to spend the rest of my life with is a schizophrenic man

If anyone has dealt with a lot of shit

But more than that, or did you win science fairs and math Olympiads and sell Girl Scout Cookies like a pro?  What were your favorite things to do as a kid?  How did the other kids treat you?  Do you have a box in the back of your mind that contains secrets that you are never going to tell anyone?  I’m genuinely interested in all of you, in how your childhoods shaped who you are today, and how you’re dealing with interactions in this grand, wide world.

Everyone was crying and I gave him a hug and whatnot, but inside I didn't really care about was happening and just wanted to get the fuck out of there. And another time I was with a friend, alone with him in his bedroom, and he just caved in and started crying. Like really gut wrenching sobs. He was telling me he was going to kill himself and started cutting himself, right there. And I tried telling him it was going to be alright and don't kill yourself, etc. But honestly, I just wanted to get out of there. 

And this happens for everything. I have emotional thoughts and feelings, they just stop talking to me because I show so little emotions. One girl though, I really do care about and (think I) am in love with. But I didn't show it at all, I can't. I feel no one really knows me, not even my parents. I hide my feelings, my self, from anyone else but me. (fantasy world; see schizotypical)

All over Reddit and other boards

Now, I cannot fathom why a person would cry for something that doesn't affect them.  

I do not remember these types of emotions being prevalent pre-cable/internet.  I can only surmise that now that we share an almost global consciousness

Personally, it's horrible kids were killed.  Yeah, it's awful people are devastated.  Yeah, I'm glad it didn't happen to me.  But, that's as far as I go.  The thought of crying and being emotional over this event being far removed it seems...mentally ill.  I get it if an event happens and it causes you to think, or evaluate your life, moves you to action - but crying all over yourself?

Logically

I tend to say absolutely nothing about about emotional issues because generally, uncaring.  I can just nod in agreement in a conversation and say, ""Yeah, it is horrible"", ""Sorry for your loss"", etc. and hope it's good enough.

I've been to a few weddings in my life, in the sense that we hang out with the same people and run into each other at parties often. They really are great people, but we've never hung out one-on-one, and I felt the same about most of the people I knew there. The reception was also dry, which didn't help things. There was a post-reception, for people who wanted to drink, but by that point I was too socially exhausted and ended up drinking a bottle of wine by myself at home instead.

While I was there, I don't understand marriage at all. In most cases I see, when people get married, they've already been together for years and are probably sharing an apartment at least, so nothing really changes. There is some financial risk, should the marriage fall apart, but there are also tax and insurance benefits, so I suppose it's a wash. I'm assuming people don't generally marry for financial reasons though

What's even stranger still, nothing's really changed. What makes this ceremony so important? I guess if you're especially into the bride or groom, you might be upset that (s)he's now off the market, but I doubt that's usually the case. I've seen two of my sisters and a handful of friends get married, and while I'm always happy that they found someone, that happened long before the wedding. I really just don't understand it, and the experience has a way of making me feel incredibly alone -- not so because I don't have a partner (and sometimes I do have a date for the wedding)

I just turned 23 and I'm a male. Both male and females feel free to weigh in on this.

  This is what I would define as a classic INTP experience. I was at a pool hall with one of my few trustworthy friends upon arrival we are checked in and our ID's are checked. Anyone below 21 gets one ""X"" drawn on each hand and anyone over 21 gets a ""thumbs up"" stamp on each hand. When the female behind the counter or check-in desk(whatever you'd call it) stamped my first hand she grabbed my hand, INTP mode activated. What happened next is a few things combined. One is that I wanted to make her job easier, two was because I had a special moment in my mind where I thought I could make the process more efficient, and three was because I wanted to avoid the awkward contact of this attractive girl I didn't know holding my hand. I would say it was equal parts of all of the above. What I did was slickly place my hand in a slight fist form on the desk/counter so she could quickly and easily stamp the top of my hand on a solid surface other than her hand... but what happened is she still went to hold my hand then stamp, which resulted in a half counter top, half her hand stamp. Which is fine. It went smoothly and was no big deal. Afterwards I thought to myself I wonder if she wanted to hold my hand or if she didn't realize what I was doing, or both. It was most likely she didn't know what I was doing. After reading INTP things all morning I thought this would be a funny little story. Any of you other INTP's have similar stories/thought processes.

1370726315.0,1fy2lx,Distinguishing Feeling from Thinking and Emotion,lavantgarde,29,3,20,"I figured it might be helpful to make a post to help differentiate what these terms mean (in the Jungian sense) since sociolinguistic conventions can lead us to think of them in certain ways.

Jung

But emotions and feelings are different. Emotions are caused by, pupil dilation, rising of blood pressure, and so forth. Emotions, in other words, are those shows of aggressiveness, anger, etc.

Feeling in the Jungian sense, or I can feel bad about it. If I don't like apples I will feel bad towards them - ""I hate apples"" - yet this is not an emotional response. Jung himself uses the example that you can tell someone, calmly, ""I hate you"" without emotion - it is simply assigning that person a negative value - and in other words you are simply expressing how you feel about that person. Yet if you tell someone ""I hate you"" as you break down crying, that is both a judgement and an emotion.

It is important to remember, and it is for this reason that it is contradictory to thinking - since thinking requires a certain amount of objectivity. If you want to think about the molecular structure about an atom you must address every individual aspect of that structure equally, and not get caught up in (feeling) thinking that only one aspect of it is important, or more important than the rest.

And it is because of this tension that primary thinkers, have archaic - or very primitive, blunt, and basic - feeling functions. Because they are used to viewing the world in a more objective way by having more control of their thoughts they become anxious by feelings. And what plagues Intellectuals are recurring value judgements, or feelings, that hold them captive. When this becomes extreme they are said to be 'invaded' as they lose control of their conscious mind. But this is another topic. 

What plagues Feelers, but value judgements. This isn't to say one is better than the other, but only that when their archaic function begins to dominate they can lose their mental balance. It is why we have preferences for one over the other, and it is why we cannot be ""half T and half F,"" etc. 

But this isn't to say that because we are thinkers we should completely ignore our feelings, as a result, also lose control of our emotions. And vice versa with feelers. 

Let me leave you with a bit of advice

&gt;""But [intellectuals] are right to be afraid [of their feeling function] because their undoing will be in their feeling. Nobody can attack them in their intellect. There they are strong and can stand alone, they can be cheated, and they know it. Therefore never force a man into his feelings when he is an intellectual. He controls [his feelings] with an iron fist because it is very dangerous.""

I'm a 19 year old guy from Amsterdam. Went to grammar school

Since a few months now, I feel like what I'm experiencing now is more pure. 

The everyday reality I'm experiencing gets a dream-like quality, but I feel extremely confused at the same time.  I know this understanding-everything-feeling is bullshit, I've had this before and I lost that feeling soon enough at the time. 

As an INTP

It feels like it's a by-product of growing (scientific) knowledge and the consequences that brings for concepts like individuality, but this could be incorrect since it's presence seems disproportional to my gaining of these realisations. 

The biggest problem seems that I seem to be alone in this
It's like I'm the only one who is blown away by the fact that there is something rather than nothing. 

It might be due to the fact that I think too much or that forcing myself into new ways of seeing things escalated into this. I smoked weed a few times, so I don't think it's related. 

I talked about it with my father once, but I'm still really hoping that someone recognizes anything like symptoms of a known mental condition or if this is just a boring, complaining, coming of age existential crisis.

I am 20 years old living in Chicago with a boyfriend of 2 years. I don't really have a real job, and cover my basic needs, but that's about it. He is always wanting to go out, which results in spending money, which I simply have no interest in or have anyways. I know he is starting to resent me for this lack of money on my end, but I just cant seem to find the words to explain why I absolutely HATE working with other people, and going ""out."" 

I have had steady jobs before, usually being promoted to shift leader or training positions shortly after hire. Even though for some reason my employers always LOVED me, I was simply miserable. I hated the work even though it was easy, and I hated socializing with the (to me simple minded, although I'm aware that's a harsh judgement) co-workers and superiors. It seems so ungrateful, knowing how many people would kill for a job, but I just could not bring myself to continue with any of these employers for an extended period of time. So as of now, selling my paintings,"" I usually just stay home

I'm fully aware I will never have any substantial income living like this. It doesn't really bother me, and ""friends."" They all think I'm unmotivated, which I suppose is true. 

I went to art school for a year but dropped out. I definitely don't see me going back to school. The only type of serious career I can see myself in would be in the fields of art or writing. I have so many abstract thoughts I wish I could share. I have started so many projects (visual, etc) but can never seem to finish any. It's a real problem (I'm sure you all know how that goes!), which makes me think any type of creative career will never be realized. Our apartment is littered with unfinished works. To me it's beautiful, almost like the apartment itself is a type of statement/self portrait, but in reality it's just clutter that nobody understands.

As far as my personal relationships go, books, and animals are my saving grace. I am super passionate about animal rights, and am vegan. Spreading awareness about animals rights is what I'm most passionate about (I make posters and flyers and spam Chicago).

In short, but nobody seems to think that is important. Should I change my life, or continue this gypsyish life style, free of any major responsibilities, commitments, and limited interactions? Is it healthy? Am I drifting away from reality? Just fooling myself?

I don't really know what I'm looking to get out of this post. This may have just been a pointless venting session.. I am brand spankin' new to reedit

I'm curious as to how other INTPs see the world now that you have been through combat in a third world environment. What are your thoughts on PTSD?  How many of you decided to stay in the military after being in combat?  Would you do it over again if you had the choice?

I dislike the fact that my most relevant title is ""veteran"" (as opposed to Dr., etc) and I have a hard time expressing what being a veteran actually means to me.  I never shared the mentality of most of my brothers-in-arms and since separating I don't feel like i would really fit in with established veteran groups the same way I didn't fit in with the Army and would love to hear a like minded assessment.

My quick answers to my questions (I'll expand in comments if asked):  

I think the ""third world"" aspect had a much more dramatic impact than the ""combat"" aspect.  After being in Iraq and living with next to nothing and seeing Iraqis living on even less then coming back to the states was a true shock.  Up until that point I never really considered how much we have and how much we complain about it.

I was diagnosed with PTSD after 33 months in country (over three deployments) and i try my hardest to ""out think"" my impulses and emotions.  For me

I got out after my third tour to Iraq and we were already getting ready for the next deployment.  I enjoyed the easiness of military life

I would absolutely do it again.  Without seeing what I saw, corruption in government and a number of other ""WTF are we doing"" type concerns) and i feel i would still be just another one of the sheeple too distracted by televised sports and video games.

I dont feel like this post is quite what I intended it to be

The latest example of this is someone I started exercising with. He ended up telling me about his painful history of sexual abuse and family instability, but at the same time I felt very uncomfortable by the conversation because I really don't know him well at all. What happened to him is tragic, and I completely understand the need for support with something as life-altering as sexual abuse, but I also find it alienating to dump such weighty material on someone you don't know very well right from the get-go.

I talked about this with one of my good friends, which I've heard is a relatively common attribute of INTPs, and that I seem like a safe person to talk to, but shit! It always seems to throw a wrench in the works in regards to developing new friendships, because the balance of personal disclosure is thrown off so early. I truly don't feel comfortable sharing personal stuff like that until well into a relationship (romantic or platonic), and the ease with which these people seem to dish it out is really unnerving. It's like they're somehow challenging me to a ""whose life sucks more"" pissing contest. Perhaps it's coincidence, but the number of times it has happened suggests otherwise.

In everyday life I typically avoid and/or ignore these types of people. Ill go along with it for a minute then just do what I intended to do to begin with.

But work...really any environment where you can't just completely ignore someone or just tell them exactly what you think...is different. With managers

With co-workers I tend to just be dismissive and use ""active assertion"" by bluntly stating what I think without sugar-coating social niceties into my response. Obviously this comes off as arrogant, I come off as an asshole. =\

So basically I am bored with almost everything. When I was younger there were lots of interesting things to learn about and experience and I did them all and liked them....until they became boring. The normal INTP experience in other words. Now I'm 40 and I've basically grown bored with every subject and activity that even sounds remotely interesting, or even if it sounds interesting (unlikely) it won't be in a month when I've exhausted it like I have everything else. Why even try? The only things left that sound interesting require large amounts of money, or extensive social interaction which is taxing and unfun to the point of nullifying the positive aspects.

I was homeschooled until 3rd grade

After 8th I was thrown into a public highschool with a very different set of skills  than the regular kids and at a different learning level

Since then I've been enrolled in an independent study program doing a few hours of school work and turning it in once a week, but still all I want is to get out of public schooling and can hardly get myself to do the school work and I soon could be facing truancy because of the lack of work I turn in. 

I'm just not sure if I'm alone in this or if it's standard INTP life. If it is average what am I supposed to do? My life just feels like a loop of dread ending and starting with me turning in a little bit of work to tide my teacher over.

Anyone with a similar story? Tips? Advice even?

Before I start

Anyway, by the way, that I mean this only within things I'm passionate about. In high school, for instance, I was well aware that I could get much better grades by actually studying every once in a while, but I just didn't give a shit and I knew the grades I was getting were ""good enough"" without the effort. So I didn't put in any effort, because I could survive without it.

But now, mostly stuff inspired by manga and I'm very passionate about this, and extremely serious. So I want to work towards this goal. I really do. I want to say, fuck everything else, I'll just draw all fucking day and I'll be good enough.
I'm a pretty big believer in hard work regardless, your mileage may vary.)

Yet even though I believe so strongly in hard work, start drawing, and then get distracted.
My dad is a hardcore ISTJ that is capable of working for weeks straight with no breaks aside from meals and sleep. So I asked him about it, work this much, and then I can do other stuff.
I tried that. It never works.

I know it sounds pathetic, but I keep doing it.

I guess I should point out that I'm not *that* bad, I live in Israel right now so enlisting in the army is next and there's no university until after that. My enlistment is in December, so that means I have three months of free time to work at it as much as I want. Why can't I bring myself to treating it like a job, and working 8 hours a day? I want to make products I can be proud of. I want to start actually drawing comics, not just doodling. I started a lot. I wrote out a script, but I'm only four pages into storyboarding it (like doodling the exact comic, but without the effort, I think.

That's the thing, but I get bored upon realizing that this work I'm so passionate about is 90% thoughtless moving pencil on paper. So I try to challenge myself and come up with new projects, but again, it never works.

I remember a lot of MBTI tests ask whether you're more excited about starting projects or finishing them. I can never answer that
What I'm not excited about is the middle.

There's the idea for a new project -- you start it
And then you get bored. You start seeing how far your abilities are from making this project the best it could be, I'm just working my ass off to make an 'okay' product. Another thing that disappoints me is that I'm not that good. I get embarrassed. I start realizing that even though hard work for the next five years could make me a god at whatever I'm doing, I'm still going to spend the majority of those five years being shit. 

This is how crazy it gets: I want to show my drawings here so that you can see and judge for yourselves and see where I'm coming from. Like,) and I really really want to be this good, (link to proper manga stuff.) But I can't even do that. Why? Because I'm fucking embarrassed. I've been working at this for the majority of my life, at least an hour a day, and my standards are too high to be happy with anything, even though almost everyone responds positively to my work, I cannot convince myself it's good enough. That's why I want to make something amazing and prove to myself that I am capable and I can do it, so I just excuse myself by coming up with an idea I convince myself is better

I'll give you an example when it comes to painting, so when I paint I end up having ~15 canvases of half completed paintings, and ~5 canvases of completed ones. I don't even have any idea how I managed to complete the few I did, to be honest.

I think I sound like I feel large entitlement to stuff I don't deserve because I didn't work hard enough, I just want to make something I could be proud of, I feel like it's worth nothing and it's really frustrating. I apologize if this comes off as attention seeking, I just genuinely want help.

I am just interested in what is true, is trustworthy. I would rather understand what the Bible is communicating than force some meaning on the text just to make some positive impact.

1357607039.0,165jup,College Advice,rao1434,23,1,21,"Hi

Basically I'm finding the whole college experience to be pretty disappointing. Freshman year was awful

First off, even though I do better in peaceful, scheduled places, that's not how the world is. I figured I should put myself in an environment where I have to learn to be comfortable in groups of people because I won't (probably) have the opportunity to coddle myself once I'm in the professional world. Being at a big school is not entirely negative of course, there are a lot more interesting activities to pursue and I'm glad that I have access to those, but it is very stressful and energy-consuming for me to be around other people almost all the time.

Academically and socially I've gotten a little lost as well. I had a small but strong group of friends in high school, but whether I'm able to hold onto them for an extended period of time is another story. Again, it's something that I'm working on. I make a conscious effort now to think of fun things to do that I can invite people to join me in, but doing that kind of thing doesn't come naturally to me at all. I think part of the problem is that the people I am most attracted to as friends tend to be somewhat like me--at least a little on the introverted side, take school very seriously, and not the best at making plans. But, to be honest, and people who I know well certainly don't see me that way, and I pretty much always feel stressed or preoccupied. What especially frustrates me about this is that I genuinely like meeting new people and doing things with others--I just wish I could skip the whole 'meeting' part. 

It's my academic performance, but I'm beginning to see now that that was mainly due to force of will. I'm gradually coming to appreciate the fact that I study hard...but not particularly well. I've always been a pretty ambitious student, and my goal when studying has always been to learn EVERYTHING. I'm very detail-oriented and have always been better at being thorough than being efficient. In high school this wasn't too much of a problem because the courses moved at a slower place, but now all the material I am learning is so dense and coming at me so quickly that I often feel overwhelmed. I long for a dose of INTJ-style pragmatism in these situations because I feel like I too often stick with the most 'thorough' studying methods, even if they aren't the most effective. I also have very diverse (I am pretty much continually thinking about changing my major) and ambitious academic interests and hold myself to very high standards, which only compounds these problems. And like others, I hate admitting that I don't understand something or can't solve my problems on my own, not a very pragmatic solution.

I don't mean to make it out like my experience has been entirely negative. I like to think that with every semester I am learning more about myself and becoming better adapted to the world around me. But this whole experience has just been so much harder than I thought it would be. Not to say that I thought it would be easy

I'll go first.

I used to be a very religious person. This is greatly influenced by my mother's side of family. We pray before every meal and go to church every Sunday. My grandfather even established a charity and built a church in mainland China to improve the corrupted land. He is a tough guy

Anyway, I became very religious. I never care about my appearance, always nice to people, offer a hand to the helpless. I'm not particularly a social butterfly though, all my friends are the ""needy"". I remember a scenario very well: my two friends once fought each other (literally grabbing each of my arms) shouting ""She's mine!"". Similar situations happen quite often. When that happens, I usually just run off, and if they ask where I'd been I'd say I went to piss. These were all in primary school.

Fast forward to fourth grade, but somehow I just can't recall the details now as if my brain has delete them to avoid me remembering those painful memories.

Never realized the damage done until now. In sixth grade I finally collapsed and tried to kill myself. However, exhausted. I became an atheist eversince. (I'm now agnostic. You can never be sure, can you?)

Then I found the internet! It became a daily boost for me to go on. I eventually got into video games and made some friends (r/l) who are also gamers/INTPs. Recently I just left my homeland (HK) and study abroad here in UK. I had to say I hardly miss HK

I actually thought about what kind of person I want to be before coming here. Sometimes I became really tired of being a loner. You know that feeling. It's like I know how to make that step, like I've always been. But you see, being a loner gives me more space to think. It's just that when you are a loner for all your life you sort of don't give a crap anymore and tbh I kinda like it.

Another reason why I stay in my comfort zone is because I fear. I fear that I make that step I'll just make myself a complete idiot and do something ridiculous

My last relationship was with this girl who was an opposite type of personality. She's emotionally minded, but we ended up dating. Conflicts were pretty normal with us through the relationship, usually because communication broke down between the logical and emotional sides of us. Usually over messiness, romantic gestures falling short of what she wanted, me not being able to appreciate music in the same way as her. Sort of INTP normal problems from what I gather. 

**I ended up cheating on her almost the entire relationship

About 2 or 3 months into the relationship, and made me hurt, angry, frustrated. My ex was visiting me one weekend and things started to get a little weird. I knew I should get up and get some air, and make sure nothing would happen. But then I reasoned, I was pretty sure the relationship between me and the current girl wasn't going to work out, she was being terrible to me emotionally, so maybe this wasn't a bad thing. 

We ended up sleeping together, well this is validation I need to break things off with my girlfriend. Except I never could quite bring myself to do it, always putting it off for the next day. A month later I realized that my feelings for this girl was winning out, and I really didn't want to break things off with her. Which put me in a problem spot for what to do. 

I did the next instinctual thing and researched the problem on Google and reddit. The results that came back was that the truth on cheating always comes out eventually

**I should just tell her then, her answer was always the same. I would instantly break up with that person and never ever be with them again. That was a terrible answer for me to swallow. I really liked the girl, maybe even loved her, and I didn't feel anything for my ex at all. It was a stupid mistake, but she wouldn't see it that way. 

I tried to put it all behind me and forget about it, next hour she would walk up with a text message from my ex and it would all be over. I would no longer be able to be with this girl I loved ever again. But what other choice did I have?

That question lingered in my mind for another week until I came up with something. I could continue to be friends with my ex, I reasoned.

I went to see the ex (lives in a nearby city) to hang out with her. She wanted me to act more like a boyfriend than a friend, because she wanted more from me, and couldn't be around me if I couldn't give that to her. 

Time froze in my head. I could go home, but there wasn't much chance to begin with that we'd still be together because of her views on cheating, and that 2 months had passed made it that much worse. Or I could pretend to be what my ex wanted me to be. I reasoned the first two options I had already been considering for the last two months and I already knew what I had already decided. I apologized to my ex, we ended up sleeping together again. 

Over the next few weeks I tried to figure something out, I reasoned, she was totally frustrated with my absolute ineptitude of emotional displays and messiness, the situation might resolve itself. 

Months passed. I really truly was completely in love with my girlfriend. Us breaking up seemed like less and less of a probability. The ex would get angry if I didn't come visit her (and act like her boyfriend and sleep with her) every 2 months

My ex valued long term commitment more than anything else. If I could go to her and tell her with absolute resolution that this girl would be in my life for a long time, I chose to wait. 

But something interesting happened. I was already there, I *really didn't want to see her*. She eventually got mad and texted my ex that I cheated on her. I went with playing it off like my ex was jealous and in love with me (true) and that she made it all up (what else was I supposed to do, the truth should have come out months before if I was going to tell her). She eventually bought it, we were back together, I thanked whatever invisible gods there were out there because I could finally be free of this mess. 

...I called my ex to ask why she did told her. She said it was a conscience thing and she wanted to be free of the secret. **At least I didn't give her hard evidence

Eventually I went on a vacation and she was at my apartment. My computer screen was on and she happened to read a message, but it didn't matter, she had insight into what she thought was the truth (my facebook messages) which was really lies to my ex. 
-------------------------------------
**Aftermath:** I've spent a lot of time analyzing everything that happened. I was too immature to have good enough morality or wisdom to not have cheated on her in the first place. My logic compounded the problem exponentially. Normally this would have been caught by my friends, I couldn't see that it was unfair to her as a person to not tell her. I never wanted to hurt her. I was completely and utterly in love with her. I still am, more or less. If I was more connected to my feelings I would have chosen differently as well. I would have been effectively much wiser with the whole situation. I see that now, I didn't then. 

**I've come now to view my personality as an INTP to be one of the greatest gift and one of the worst curse you could ever possibly have. The lack of emotional development is something you can develop, but it never will answer the question of what makes you happy or align your actions with your desires. I wanted to marry that girl and be happy with her. I ended up hurting her in the worst way possible, because in a view of the world with just logic, your logic might run over your feelings in the process. **",,False,,False,t3_1dcupy

If so, how have they affected you?",Verify_Password_Btch,22,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/1blo4c/is_anyone_else_here_on_antianxietydepression_meds/, I functioned at a mediocre standard and if there was something I had to do it would always get done. I was your typical melancholy guy

But that was the problem. None of my problems were apparent. I had always convinced myself that there was nothing wrong, which would lead to periods of depression. Even though I knew the thoughts I had were pointless/unwarranted no matter what direction I drew my mind towards, I just couldn't get out of that desert highway to no mans land. Occasionally I would have a good day and I would remark upon how I should feel like that everyday, an exercise in futility which was always more hopeful than practical. I would say about 70-80% of my life for a few years was spent below that metaphorical line. Life was acceptable and complaining about it was sacrilege to me, but none of the good emotions were there. No joy, no wonder, no spark. It felt like I'd hit a dead end at life and that was it. That was how things were. 

Now, the idea had been loathe to me for many, many years. I always assumed only people with the highest of mental problems took them. No, with varying degrees of success and failure I tried; exercise, being more social, talking profusely about my problems (with different people who I trusted), changing my lifestyle, etc. The one which had the most effect was the exercise, until you realise that nothing's changed. Lifestyle change did fuck all

From my perspective what the SSRI has done is uncluttered my mind. My mind will still follow tangents occasionally, and I managed not to drift off trying to make hundreds of relevant points. Something which would have seemed an impossible task 4 months ago. Another improvement that has come about is social situations. The anxiety is much lessened, and I no longer feel as if I'm one step behind or three steps ahead of the conversation, I can have a conversation that has flow to it. Plus I actually care about what the other person has to say (sometimes). Most importantly, my apathy is gone, I am excitable again. I have thoughts which make me smile and laugh, it's glorious!

There is another thing I'd like to mention

However, very rarely do these drugs actually worsen peoples lives.

However

In no particular order:

* I did Muay Thai at a legitimate training gym for a while and this worked really well as I didn't have to think for an hour and just followed directions. The changeup from day-to-day satisfied my need for variety and the peer pressure helped me exert way more effort and not try to cut corners with some new efficiency technique I thought up. Realized that executing physical actions wasn't a talent and was really interesting to see how practice became habit as I started out as awkward and rigid as possible due to overthinking how to do physical movements.

* While organized training worked well once I got there

* As for general gym, but the mashups were intellectually intriguing enough to get me into the music. They were designed around keeping a crowd amped and that carries over great to cardio rhythm. I find that I'm way better if I start this tempo of music on my way to the gym. If anyone's interested, my favorite mashups are free on the BootieSF website. They range from poppy (Katy Perry vs. The Dougie) to more badass (Iron Maiden vs. Bollywood). UPDATE: Here's the link to the mashups I really like: http://bootiemashup.com/bestof/. They definitely fall into the crowd-pleaser end of the spectrum.

* Short term use of pre-workout mix worked great for getting in the habit of the gym. Kinda like a super energy drink, I think my body just associated working out with feeling great and I didn't have to deal with the physical resistance to going. Totally worth the investment if getting back on the horse or developing a new habit.

* Always keeping my clothes ready and packed is huge. Before I exercised regularly, keeping backup deodorant and backup hair product in my bag as standard cuts down on stupid excuse friction if I have a social event after the time I plan to hit the gym.

**The Way of What is to Come**

If I speak in the spirit of this time, but I must. (I skip around)

The supreme meaning is the beginning and the end. It is the bridge of going across and fulfillment

*The image of God throws a shadow that is as great as itself*

It is no teaching and no instruction that I give you. On what basis should I presume to teach you? I give you news of the way of this man, but not in Gods, nor in teachings, nor in laws. Within us is the way, the truth, and the life.

There is only one way and that is your way

*The one eye of the Godhead is blind

This is just a small taste of the work written by a man

The events that happen are always the same. But the creative depths of man are not always the same. Events signify nothing

If the God grows old, and he goes down. The greatest truth becomes the greatest lie, the brightest day becomes the darkest night. As day requires night and night requires day, so meaning requires absurdity and absurdity requires meaning. Day does not exist through itself, night does not exist through itself. The reality that exists through itself is day and night. So reality is meaning and absurdity.*So meaning is a moment and a transition from absurdity to absurdity, and absurdity only a moment and a transition from meaning to meaning*

My deep interior is a volcano, into the primordial beginning, I myself become smelted anew in the connection with the primordial beginning, which at the same time is what has been and what is becoming. At first I come to the primordial beginning in myself. But because I am a part of the matter and formation of the world, I also come into the primordial beginning of the world in the first place.

* Creative
* Strongly motivated by curiosity
* Idealistic: wants to make the world a better place and people happier
* Happy obsession with a hobby or hobbies

And Less importantly.

* Aware from early childhood that he is different
* Intelligent
* Opinionated and outspoken
* Noncompetitive
* Unusual in his eating habits and living arrangements
* Not particularly interested in the opinions or company of other people
* Possessed of a mischievous sense of humour
* Single
* Usually the eldest or an only child
* Bad speller

My father mows lawns for a living and seems to think that any activity that does not immediately earn you money is not worth doing.  Most of my family members are also deeply religious and believe that any activity that takes time away from worshiping god is, likewise

All of this had a pretty disastrous impact on my life and I think being denied the freedom to embrace my INTP personality probably had the biggest impact.  There was a lot of stress and anxiety caused by the conflict between what I wanted internally and the external pressures put upon me.  If I were free to simply life my life as I saw fit

I'm 21, 5'10"", happy, healthy and able bodied with both a pilots license and a helicopter license.  I absolutely love *good* music, I love motorcycles including dirt bikes, and my favorite activity is reading until I pass out.

But I'm disgusted with the direction of our society.  Just absolutely tired of it in more ways than one.  I don't claim to have higher intelligence than others, and done it all enough that it has all become a DVD intro left on repeat when you fall asleep on the couch.  I've felt this way initially when I was 16, but only felt strongly about it when I turned 18. - I've been lucky enough to travel a ton since I was a child, it's definitely helped shape my world view to where it is now. One time I was riding a horse in a very poor part of Brazil when I was 8, and like it was yesterday, I can remember the looks and the reactions I received from the poor villagers and children who could not stop staring and touching my Nikes, like I was Jesus incarnate. You want to talk about a first time for checking your privilege, dad. My Fe may be inferior to my intuition

I currently have nothing holding me down. I flunked out of college on my own dime, it almost seems like a blessing in disguise.  It just wasn't for me and I probably would have quit before I graduated. Yes I was in it for the money, much like 80% of the rest of the students. Before (and now) I have a job cleaning nuclear turbines that is dirty and hard work, very physical manual labor, 12 hour shifts for sometimes three weeks straight, then usually a month off.  I usually net about upwards of $2,000 for a two week job if I keep my per diem - the great part is I get to travel to all these exciting locations like the Dominican Republic, Saudi Arabia, depressing

I'm extremely introverted, and I don't feel bad for admitting it. I enjoy camping alone, I did LSD for my first time alone, I do all my shop work alone; I can be a team player, but only because I don't have time to cause a disturbance by being too good to be one.  I feel I can be whatever someone wants me to be in their company, but alone, I am truly my self.

The greatest pleasure for me in my life has been riding my motorcycle and doing manual labor work.  My dad has instilled the importance of working with your hands and doing hard work into me from a very young age from bailing hay to picking up every rock on the four mile dirt road.  I don't mind it

Over time though, attending social gatherings, being up to date on the latest trends, NONE of it appeals to me. I can't watch TV for more than 5 minutes, it's disgusting. It pisses me off how saturated, commercialized, and bloated everything has become.  I'm not eternally bitter, it is all just such a facade to me

I've realized I only grow as an individual the more I push myself to experience things outside my comfort zone

Right now in Alberta CA the oil and gas industry is booming.  Paying for a place to live is expensive, but the pay is ridiculously lucrative, and it seems to fit my skill set. There are guys who start out as total greenhorns making $40K per job.  It's insane.

I can't come up for a reason to NOT go up and work for as long as I can last, rather so I can travel at my own leisure and experience the most possible 'experiences' I can.  

If I could save up 450

At one point I will run out of money

There seem to be so many puzzle pieces and sometimes I think I have the whole ""box"" called life figured out, and of course the curve ball called life. 

Here is my question to you all at /r/intp;

* How unrealistic would you say this plan is ?
* What do you personally think of it ?
* What is your personal 'plan' if you don't mind sharing?
* How are you doing? :)

Please be honest

If you read it all

**TL;DR** I don't want to participate in society

I just want to know what y'all think.  Because that is what we do all day when were day dreaming correct? thinking? It's great

Perhaps I should provide a little background first.  I'm a currently unemployed 28 year old male living with my mother and older brother in an undeveloped back-woods area.  The only jobs I've had was as a janitor and the highest income I've ever had was around $7000.  There really aren't many options or opportunities here.

For most of my life I've had an interest in computer programming and I have taught myself a few different languages.  Most of my projects were video game related

These are some of the reasons I am hesitant to attend college:

* A demanding schedule might leave me too tired to think.
* Too little time to freely pursue interests.
* No desire to get into debt -- that would only make my situation worse.
* Uncertain if I'd be able to cover basic living expenses.
* Not learning anything I'd be incapable of learning on my own.
* Uncertain if it would have any real effect on my ability to start a career.
* Graduating worse off than if I hadn't gone at all.
* If I'm going to put a lot of time and effort into something
* My family wouldn't approve of me going

Some of the reasons why I should go to college:

* My life is going nowhere with no foreseeable way of it getting better.
* I'm stuck in an area where the only successful business is the grocery store
* I'm surrounded by hill-billies and hicks.
* I rarely leave my room.
* It would be nice being around people who are motivated and enthusiastic about potentially interesting things.
* Maybe it could eventually help me get a jobs as a computer programmer
* It could provide a framework that could allow me to be more focused and productive.

The author's main point here is that having the multitude of choices we have in modern Western society is making us depressed. Buyer's remorse

Many would say that the quarter-life crisis and the mid-life crisis are first-world problems. We are simply presented with too many choices. Modern transportation and communication technologies have enabled us to live anywhere we want in the world. Just a few hundred years ago, how to make a living, what hobbies to pursue, who to marry, etc. Eventually, in the darkest times in our lives, we will question our choices, leading to an existential crisis.

As INTPs

Although I do not agree with everything that is stated in his work

I am not a luddite. I use technologies from smart phones to social networks to supercomputers and electron microscopes. Technology makes me happy in the way that a drug would.

TL;DR (I highly doubt that anyone will read through my poorly written article...): Modern society presents us with too many choices and as a result

TL;DR of the TL;DR: Free will == unhappiness

Does anyone here feel something similar? How do you deal with choices and indecision as an INTP?

Okay, F/T, P/J on my tests. I am his first girlfriend but he has had many online relationships with girls(not sure how to word it but they shared a deep connection but never had anything official). We are both recent grads living together in his mom's apartment, both of us are unemployed as of now...

Anyway

* his father passed away a few years ago(before we started going out) and his mother(an ENFJ) is part of cult she's kind of delusional and very irresponsible which really bothers my bf

* he is facing a lot of health problems

* he is worn out after his graduation was  forcibly dragged out  another year by his professor

* he is having trouble getting a job and even finding motivation to apply to them. I can't blame him for this. He has had past experience in the ""working world"" already and he thinks it's generally terrible and I agree.

* he feels guilty about being a shut in/doing nothing all day and not being being ""responsible"" by job hunting etc

* he is being annoyed by a friend (ESTJ) he doesn't care much about. the friend constantly calls him b/c he's going through a break up and always asks to play games him my bf

Anyway, cleaning etc. I never judge/nag/criticize him, I try to keep him company as much as I can. Play games together, watch shows together etc, accompany him on walks/adventures whenever he gets the urge even if it's 3 am etc. 

I think he's generally happy with me ? but I know deep down he's unhappy in some places because he thinks our relationship is sub-optimal, this sort of conversation has happened several times before and he has told me he tried to be more entp ish for me but it's not natural for him and that he has also thought of me becoming more esfp to help him but things just don't really work that way ? He also concluded that he thinks I'm not an isfp, (he actually can't type me at all) because he has had an isfp girl help him out a lot before too so in theory if I'm an isfp I could help him too.

Honestly I think a lot of my issues of not being able to help him is because I basically had zero friends

**Edit :**Okay thanks for all the responses everyone. It's given me a better perspective on things. I think we can all see he is not in a healthy mental state right now. Given everyone's input I think my bf withdrew initially after his father died and kind of gave up after that as everything around him seemingly went into disarray and he got overwhelmed with problems. I probably didn't emphasize it enough but my bf is typically always in discomfort due to teeth and stomach problems so I'm going to help him meet with doctors etc. I'm also trying to discourage his general pessimism and help him understand himself better because I don't really think he understands how to make his own intp brain happy. I'm also gonna try to get him to not put so much value into this mbti stuff as it really just ends up making things worse in general for him. If we end up breaking up ( which I don't think will happen unless he really refuses to face his problems ) that's fine by me. Anyway

&gt;I cannot definitively answer that. But I can say that you, for all intents and purposes, the same person. Sure, you'd be separated from that person mentally and physically, but there would be no reason to determine a difference between you, there aren't any. You would be specimen 1 and specimen 2 of the same individual, there would be no reason for you to share any form of ""connection.""

Certain things about you are determined by your DNA makeup, your genome, two brains with an identical make-up will always react the same answer when faced with a stimuli. Everything you think

&gt;Now, but it is a reasoning of sorts that convinces me. ""Self"" is a concept, a meaning, not a reality. You are only you as much as you say you are. In my mind consciousness is merely a side effect of having such an advanced and complex brain. It only makes sense, think about it for a moment. All of your senses culminate in your brain, it makes sense of the information your sensory organs pick up.

The illusion of self is likely known to a lot of you. And good drug experience will make it blatantly obvious that when your attention is tuned to the present moment (instead of just in a sea of thought) it doesn't feel like ""I"". And then contemplative meditation just makes it vividly clear without the rush of a drug in your system.

The illusion of free will is something that isn't as fun to learn about (I really struggled with it for a while) but ultimately I think I am a better more enriched person for it. It's also harder to describe and sum up. This matter is slightly more open to debate but even the strongest scientific claims for the existence of free will are radically different than how most people view their actions.

I'd certainly say that if you are oblivious to the illusion of self that this is going to be a very uncomfortable listen. 


Sorry for the length of this. The two videos (well more his books) have had a radical impact on how I view the world (especially coupled with meditation).

I guess I'm wondering if you consider yourself a ""dreamer"" ? Even when I'm not stressed out or bored I've been known to drift off. Would you consider yourself an escapist? How are you when you're extremely stressed out? I go from two extremes: completely isolate myself or make sure that I'm constantly going out and seeing friends. Do you ever feel increasingly disconnected from reality for long periods of time? Do you tend to just switch off from reality?


Are these basic human characteristics? Is it normal for people to just disconnect from reality when you feel like your whole life is kind of just falling apart? Feeling kind of lost right now and confused... and you guys are  like my favourite people on the internet so

1369013022.0,1eo02z,INTP Shadow Functions: merging with the shadow?,magneticenergy,20,4,17,"I think I may have discovered some novel relationships between the normal and shadow functions. I'm only intermediately versed in typology

**Here's what my hypothesis does:**

1) It accounts for the polarization of i/e functions in myers-brigg typology while maintaining 'separation' between the i/e planes (only shadows can cross between the planes). 

2) It demonstrates that there is a much larger diversity between the personality types than what was previously accounted for in the traditional theories. 

**Here it goes:**

Every function within the myers-brigg cognitive stack is coupled with a shadow which determines how that function is expressed. ~~For example, while an extroverted function (Ne) would be internally energized by an introverted shadow (Fi). All thoughts must pass a certain energy 'threshold' to go from unconscious to conscious.

So let's assume that all of the functions exist on a spectrum, T is polarized with F, and S is polarized with N. Theoretically, all of your thoughts lie somewhere in this spectrum, and all functions, shadow or normal, are constantly expressed at all times (to a certain degree). This really isn't that far-fetched of a statement

When we are doing something introverted, thus the 'extroverted plane' is unconscious (shadow). In our stack, Se and Te are shadow functions, so if an extroverted shadow is expressed in conjunction with Ti, it would have to be one of those. It took me a long time to figure it out in a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/1emhw5/modification_of_intp_functional_stack/) that makes little sense how the shadows correspond to the functions. I based my logic on the esoteric meanings of these functions. I know that sounds silly, but how do you think Jung came up with these ideas??? Just assume for arguments sake that my calculations are correct, Ti's shadow is Se. I'm not exactly sure what this means

So as I began to mix/match various shadow/normal functions together,3,4. So, the shadow function in 1 would not be expressed in 2, the shadow in 3 not in 4, 4 not in 1, etc. (it loops around). Apparently this pattern has something to do with the process of [Individuation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individuation). You must confront your shadow in order to progress to the next function. The consequence of this behavior is that the function within the stack immediately proceeding the function you 'conquered' will not express the conquered shadow. So there are technically 2 shadows associated with each function, the other under-expressed.

Here is my tentative **INTP Functions Chart**

**Primary:** Introverted Thinking (Ti)

Expressed Shadow - (Se) Repressed shadow - (Ni)

**Secondary**  Extroverted Intution (Ne)

Expressed Shadow - (Fi) Repressed shadow (Se)

**Tertiary** Introverted Sensation (Si)

Expressed Shadow (Te) Repressed shadow (Fi)

**Inferior** Extroverted Feeling (Fe)

Expressed Shadow (Ni) Repressed shadow (Te)


Here are some consequences of this pattern for INTPs:

1) While Ti is functioning, Fe won't have enough 'potential energy' to express itself. So as a consequence of Ti shadow coupling, Fe is indirectly suppressed. Ni is our darkest shadow and is the last shadow 'conquered' in our stack.

2) Both Ne and Fe are strongly polarized towards their respective ends (N and F)

3) The Fi shadow of Ne may disrupt Ti's ability to be expressed by Ne. I'm not sure how this would manifest, AKA the MIDDLE OF THE SPECTRUM. This allows Ne to be expressed in an immensely diverse way, but this could also lead to contradictory or unproductive information, especially since Ne is polarized very far away from the Se side of the spectrum (more in your head, less out there). This is an INTP's Ne, which is not the same as an ENTP's Ne.

4) Using Beebe's archetype analysis, the Anima is coupled with the Witch etc etc. This actually fits in amazingly well with Jungian psychology so heavily dominated by myth. 'The hero must battle the trickster in order to move on the the next level' (individuation).

5) As we continue to mature and develop our functional stack

**Why is this theory useful?**

1) It accounts for the polarization of i/e functions in myers-brigg typology while maintaining 'separation' between the i/e planes (only shadows can cross between the planes). 

2) It demonstrates that there is a much larger diversity between the personality types than what was previously accounted for in the traditional theories. For example, which means that 3 separate descriptions are required to adequately explain what 'Ne' really means. Furthermore, this allows for wiggle room within the types based on how well each person has 'conquered their shadow'.

For example
&gt;Competency is a key driving factor in the INTP. When studying something, he moves on to the next skill.""

Or [this](http://www.intp.org/intprofile.html):
&gt;While proficiency may not be a central goal, then it is very important for him that he reaches a sufficient level so that basic errors can be avoided. Errors made by others are to be expected and can be criticized. But errors made by oneself attack the very root of the person, which is ultimately about rationality, logic and truth. INTPs hate to think of themselves being in any way inadequate, at least in areas that are important to them. So, as soon as he puts himself behind some task, then he must achieve competency. But that is as far as it goes. Refined competency requires too much effort and has little attraction. It would require practice and that usually bores an INTP. Hence, achieving competency

As I pondered these statements when I first ran across them years ago, I am a musician, and play sports, and both require a lot of practice. I've been doing both activities for a large number of years, so I am beyond competent, but not truly *great* at both. And I want to achieve that in some areas of my life beyond my day job, where I naturally ""practice"" it every day.

Further, I highly suggest reading the fascinating books [The Talent Code: Unlocking The Secret of Skill](http://thetalentcode.com/), and the book [Mindset:The New Psychology of Success](http://www.amazon.com/Mindset-The-Psychology-Success-ebook/dp/B000FCKPHG/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361124606&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=mindset), which emphasizes hard work and practice at the heart of success.

The thing is, and so just reinforcing bad habits. I love doing it with a trainer, or a coach, and I have both. But that doesn't replace that hundreds of hours you should be spending just improving your skills on your own.

If you want to perform like a pro

My question to the group is: are any of you good at practicing? How do you do it?

Specific questions that I'd like to answer about practicing:

1. How do you enforce self-discipline to practice regularly? This is the kind of self-discipline that I don't think we INTPs are inclined to be good at.

2. How do you make sure that you are practicing what you should

3. How do you adjust your practice to gain new talents

4. On the flipside of 3

5. How do you keep this engaging? Month after month of this becomes boring

Anyone achieve a measure of success with practicing in spite of our natures? Are there any books people would recommend that explain how to do this?

well, since no ones' ever admitted something like that to me, but I never really intended for that to happen so I told him it's never gonna happen and he seemed cool with it. The thing is, before I realized that he liked me he texted me everyday for a month long, and after I gave him the rejection he stopped.(which gave me the impression that he obviously only spoke to me to get in my pants or some metaphor like that)

BUT he still wants to be my friend (or so he makes me think, like once a month or something. Needless to say, it's annoying, and he's boring, and I don't want to be his friend, but I am a nice polite person so I am just nice to him and try to keep the conversations short even though he won't let me.

I don't know whether it's because I know he fancied me and the fact that he did put me a little off and made him a little annoying to me or because we have absolutely nothing in common and I don't really talk to people that I don't have things in common with, I just don't want to be stuck in a conversation like that) . Though i should've known when his first question to me was what church I go to that he'd be like that . 

I feel like such a bad person. o.O What makes things worse is that he lives in my neighbourhood, doesn't it bother him remotely that I never initiate contact with him and always cancel appointments with him? whyyyyyy!? D'':

Another time, I ended up rear-ending the car right in front of me; what made it worse was that at the time, I was driving without insurance (it was my mom's car, and I didn't usually drive, so the family never bothered to get me insurance); so when it happened, and the driver that I hit stepped out of the car and walking towards me, I just panicked completely, and I just reversed, but I ran the red light and got away.

There are other incidents, and before I always thought that this was just one of the many quirks to my personality, believing them to be isolated incidents and probably would not happen again. But now I know them to be the result of my underdeveloped Fe function, and that for me to stop pulling these reckless shits, the best thing is for me to develop my Fe function and bring balance to my functional stack.

1374707081.0,1izn70,Anybody here served on a Jury?,PatricioINTP,14,2,15,"I have been in two and wondered how my experience compared to others.  To me

**tl;dr**:  The following is just my experience

My first trial was only a 15 minute deliberation.  The defendant was accused of animal cruelty when he shot a pitbull… which was attacking his Doberman with his wife nearby.  It literally went like this:

Young adult woman:  “So who should be the foreman?”

Mid-aged man:  “You”

YAW:  “Ooookayyy.  So who thinks he is guilty?”

[No one raise his or her hand]

This was followed by 10 minutes of reviewing the evidence and 4 minutes going, but are we really done here?”

The other was more proper.  Two brothers were living with an elder who need oxygen.  The two were drunk, and the older picked up an oxygen tank and just let gravity take over.  His entire face was smashed.     The prosecution wanted murder in the first, the defense self-defense.  The judge did tell us we may rule in favor for 2nd degree and manslaughter.

Now I am very uncomfortable discussing what happened in there for two reasons.  First, is it applicable, and how it was written in front of us.  Neither side wanted 2nd degree or manslaughter, but they just said, “It is not 2nd degree” without saying why.  We ended up going for 1st degree.  The second reason?  Ends up our foreman happen to know the defendant.  His attorney is challenging the ruling because of it.

In both cases, but otherwise spent most of my time either reviewing the evidence and just listening (and observing) the other 11.  It is kinda disappointing that the best part of the trial happens behind closed doors but, as one who’s been there and done that, if what happens in there gets out, I may or may not be good about it.  Deliberating someone else’s fate is nerve wracking to some.  Others who are social control freaks should never get in such of a room.  (Anyone here saw 12 Angry Men?)

The one change I would like is more control over what we can ask.  In trial, the prosecution cannot bring up the defendant’s criminal past.  In my first trial, the neighbors testified for the prosecution and one juror commented during deliberations, “I suspect those two families hate each other”.  (They were in a car and the daughter was instructed to take photographs of the dogs attacking each other and the pitbull getting shot, while the daughter was in the back seat)  For my second trial, there was one phrase in the 2nd degree murder definition that ANNOYED US COMPLETELY.  Wondering if we did the right thing, I looked up the definition online and never saw this phrase (which I won’t mention here… hey, with both lawyers beside him

With the recent Zimmerman trial, what happened behind that closed door is their business only.  I don’t mind if some of the information is leaked, but how and why a decision was made should be guarded unless all 6 are willing to share.  No matter how they ruled, if one disagreed and gets angry about it, I would like to point out to that person you were not there.  More often than not such of a person never was a juror or this social control freak I dread.

So
