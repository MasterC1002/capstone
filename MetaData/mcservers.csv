1. Run away from civilization until I am in no-mans land.
2. Make a secret base that nobody will find and start hoarding food and supplies.
3. Make structures that are nice enough to get a passing glace from others.
4. If there is PVP

This is fun for me because it takes effort, watch me from above and either smite me or give me his eternal blessing by showering me with items he thinks I want. This kills the entire point of playing! I don't want your items, I don't even want to see YOU with those items. Having you find my base is enough of a punch-in-the-face to make me want to leave for good. Nothing kills my effort faster than someone instantly summoning an item or building that I spent DAYS on. I play to be unique and be able to show something interesting that I created with my brain and from my hard-spent time. NOT watch you get it in seconds.

So if you want to make your severs better

1. Your focus on no-griefing is admirable
2. If you are a mod
3. I don't care if you have an economy system
4. Your moderators should be like police officers. Nobody want's to see them unless they are called. If you're mods want to play like everyone else
5. Finally,' then use spectator tools. They let you watch from a camera perspective and nobody knows you're there. DO NOT just TP yourself over to me every 10 minutes.

-

Running from top-notch hardware, a server which focuses on being deserted and lost in a world of chaos, looting but also the occasional friend.

Miner Apocalypse is not for the faint of heart. You will probably die, upon loads of fun. The original subreddit gives you base information about what players are doing, who plays on the server, and news from the staff.  
On our website you will see a list of rules

We try our best to bring our players the greatest experience from a survival/pvp/semi-vanilla server by banning hackers, moderators are able to play, but they do not have permission to ruin the game for you. If they do, you are enforced to tell us through using the /helpop command.

The server features creative use of random spawning, random spawning will be overridden (just make sure to keep your bed safe!).

There are many player-made factions on Miner Apocalypse (no, with little- to no interaction from 3rd party plugins.

The server is best enjoyed hot

The server has over 2000 players visited all time, but it should not be a real problem for international players, as long as your computer isn't running off a potato for internet.

IP: PLEASE CHECK OUR SUBREDDIT /r/minerapocalypse FOR INFORMATION ON HOW TO JOIN. IT'S IMPORTANT TO READ THE RULES BEFORE PLAYING

1313980565.0,jq6hg,/r/mcservers its time we had a talk.,,76,5,58,"This subreddit only has 2

There are a few types of minecraft servers but for the sake of simplicity we will go over two of them.

**The First:** A server that *you* own. You can physically come up and touch the box with your bare hands. You host it on hardware that you own presumably on your own (or more commonly) your mothers broadband service.

**The Second:** A service an online company provides for you. This can be a VPS, MHS, Cloud service hosting, or any other shared hosting provider. Just google [""minecraft hosting""](http://www.google.com/#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;source=hp&amp;q=minecraft+hosting&amp;pbx=1&amp;oq=minecraft+hosting&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g5&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=1589l3834l0l3874l17l7l0l0l0l0l1008l2376l1.1.1.1.0.1.0.1l6l0&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.&amp;fp=e98f3ed7284443fe&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667) the results are rather overwhelming. 

At this point you may be asking yourself ""okay whats all that have to do with me?""

I am sick and tired of pouring through 50 servers that 13 year old kids host on their laptops with promises like ""24/7 server"" and ""large user-base"". Id be willing to bet only 1 out of every 5 servers on the ""whats hot"" page of this subreddit are actually **on line**. Especially since thats about the amount of IPs that I can actualy connect to when looking for a server.

Chances are if you have your own server that is hosted by you on your own connection its going to barely be stable. ISPs change customer IP addresses constantly and Himachi isn't the greatest alternative to this dilemma. Most younger server owners are bound to host MC servers on their wireless networks

Bukkit installs and maintenance are not easy. Assuming you don't have a dedicated host that sets up Bukkit from you or has tools to set up bukkit for you, look up 1060s new permissions APIs). For every single plugin you have there are nodes you have to define in a groups file that allow your players to use one command and your mods to use another. finding these nodes and setting them up is time consuming especially if you want a good cheat proof server you need to have your ABCs covered. **bugs** when you have 20 plugins there are going to be bugs. Tons of errors, server crashes, massive lag, memory leaks. Hunting these down and finding the culprits can be difficult. Unless your a Bukkit pro and have tons of time to keep up with updates and config changes you should be advertising a 24/7 server. Players don't want to be on error ridden servers that go down every other hour.

Things I would like to see change: Educate yourself about your server and post accordingly. If you plan on having more than 5 users on at a time and you want to run a ton of plugins and have a 24/7 server look for a acceptable host. Do not hop on /r/mcservers and write a big long professional post encouraging a ton of users to join that you cant support. People spend a lot of time on servers working up stats in mcmmo


Things users looking for large servers can do instead of wasting time digging through crap to find a good server:
[http://minestatus.net/](http://minestatus.net/) This site is AWESOME it shows uptime which makes it obvious to tell who is reliable and who isn't. It also shows Players, and Score. Makes it easier to wade through the shit and find a legit server.

[http://minecraftservers.info/](http://minecraftservers.info/) I'll admit this a porly designed site. Its heavy in images and content and servers aren't sort-able by specific details. But it tends to have a more professional  userbase.

We have a chat system that has been built from the ground up.  It is less intrusive than HeroChat or the others and is pleasant to look at, as well as create your own channels for you and your friends.

Our ranking system is very robust.  With twelve separate ranks you will rank up depending on performance that is based around trust, and should rank up at a steady pace and gain abilities with each rank.  Due to the number of members we have it can be difficult to see who has been around enough for a rank up, therefore we encourage you to work with others, and engage in meaningful conversation in chat.

**Server Name:** damNation.eu

**Server Website:** [damNation.eu](http://damNation.eu)

**Server Address:** *damNation.eu:25565*

**Game Play Types / Playstyle:** A bit of all-in-one: PvE/Adventure/Survival/Build-friendly/Creative/Projects/Survival Games etc.


**Why play on damNation?:** Age limit 15+! No Map Resets! Build Friendly settings! Protected Building! High Quality Special Projects! Adventures with custom adventure setup! Treasure Hunts! Full View Distance! ...and the Friendliest Staff and Community you will ever find!

Tourists may play ""Freedom"" (survival world with Grief Prevention)


**Rules:** 

**Important rule #1**: This server is intended for mature adults with more than half a brain and we expect EVERYONE here to behave accordingly. You must be at least 15 years of age to be considered for membership.

**2.** Be courteous and respect others. Agree to disagree. No fighting

**3.** Real world legal and societal laws and rules apply! Just use your common sense

**4.** No exploits, stealing, griefing etc. You get ONE chance not to do that on this server! That means no cheat clients, especially no xray/ore finders. Cheaters, thieves and vandals do not belong here. We log all block and chest interactions and will BAN you! Do not peek into chests that belong to someone. Treasure chests (marked and notified on opening) are per player and you are expected to loot those when found (we have quite a few hidden).

**5.** Leave the landscape looking natural and beautiful please. Terraform to your hearts content, floating junk midair, screwed up water or ugly beaches/deserts anywhere please.

**6.** No giant pixelart, flags etc (statues and real ""builds"" are ok) in the regular worlds (creative play area is the only place you may build those).

**7.** Build with some taste please: Avoid large featureless walls/floors of cobble/dirt/birch/lava etc.

**8.** Aim to build within reasonable distance from each other. Minimum distance before it is customary to ask for permission is 128 blocks (=Normal Render Distance)

**9.** Make sure large redstone creations or machinery is turned off when not in use. We have a very powerful server

**10.** Always obey the admins &amp; moderators (red color names). Report misbehaviour, pm's, or mumble. Do no bother them unnecessarily, and NEVER EVER bother us for op or admin rights.

**11.** Do not spam or do commercials for other servers or any commercial services. 

**12.** You will be eligible for a FREE protected plot in the main city. You have 10 days to have a proper building there (square wood/cobble box is not proper) after which it may be taken back to the state and given to someone else (extensions only on special circumstances). The free plot may be dug to bedrock

**13.** Mobtowers/XPgrinders etc are allowed in MODERATION. Preferably with an off-switch, we have EasyEnchant, so there is little use for excessive XP grinding.

**14.** On your application to enter the server: Take the key number from rule #1 (in bold) and ADD it to the key number (also in bold) from rule #8

**15.** Before starting to ask a lot of questions, chances are someone will answer it. Please do not repeat or spam questions again and again in the chat.

1312963341.0,jee69,Preventing Griefers: How to be an Effective Moderator,Crayboff,40,8,51,"This is not a post designed to teach how to start a server or install any plugins

This post is going to cover some of the mistakes I see a lot of administrators and moderators making in their servers that leads to a large amount of griefing. Hopefully other admins/mods out there take these points seriously.

* **Figure out the scope of the server and stick with it.** Do you want it to be survival or creative? Are you going to be a chaos server or one that is more conducive to building? Whatever you decide on
* **Research plugins that will help you achieve the type of server you want.** Go into multiple servers in /r/mcservers and type the command ""/plugins"", [BigBrother](http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/sec-bigbrother-1-10-1-catch-griffers-red-handed-1000.12879/) (or [LogBlock](http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/info-admin-logblock-v1-25-spout-bedrock-cheating-fix-find-those-damn-griefers-1000.4543/)), [LWC](http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/sec-mech-lwc-v3-31-10-official-languages-lightweight-inventory-protection-management-1000.967/), Permissions and [PermissionsEx](http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/admin-dev-permissionsex.13396/), and Help.
* **Be careful who you let in!** I personally hate whitelist
* **BE EVEN MORE CAREFUL WHO YOU LET MODERATE and what permissions you give people.** Do not just give mod status to the first people you see. Carefully comb over what permissions every single group has. Let the new guys use commands like /list, or /msg. I visited a server recently that let people who just joined use a command called ""/unlimited"" which gave them unlimited of ANY items (obviously unintended because /give was blocked). When figuring out if a person should be a moderator, I ask myself: 1) Do I really need another moderator?; 2) Has this person contributed to the server more than anyone else?; 3) Can I trust this person to keep a cool head in an emotionally charged conflict? [vsTerminus made a good point about moderators](http://www.reddit.com/r/mcservers/comments/jee69/preventing_griefers_how_to_be_an_effective/c2bfsdt).
* **Thoroughly test everything before you go live.** Run a test server off your computer, he wouldn't have had the problem.
* **Don't be a dick.** Don't be the admin who abuses their power because they can. Don't go crazy and mess with people just because. When you are assholes to people you will justify (at least in their eyes) griefing. It is your duty as a moderator to be level headed and smart about things. [This is a very good article on how to be a good moderator
* **Don't be a push over.** While you shouldn't be a douchebag, but if they do it again, then feel free to kick them out of the server.
* **Visit other servers.** One of the most useful things I've done was go visit other servers and see how they moderate. I check the plugin list
* **Be careful where you advertise.** I prefer only advertising on /r/mcservers because that is the demographic of people I like to have on my server. Keep in mind that the more places you advertise the more attention your server will get and the more likely you will have griefers at your front door. I'm not saying don't advertise
* **Watch griefing videos.** This is perhaps one of the strangest, being douchebags, etc.). I also suggest signing up for [griefing forums](http://teamavolition.com/forums/), watch [stream chats](http://www.teamavolition.com/stream), and just generally keeping tabs on the griefing community. *Popular Griefing Teams*: [Team Avolition](http://www.youtube.com/teamavolition) and [AusMinecraftGriefers](http://www.youtube.com/user/AusMinecraftGriefers)
* **Accept that shit happens**: You cannot be perfect

**Common Red Flags:**

This is a list of Redflags when observing either a visitor to your server (or even current members who are potentials for mod status):

* **Beggars**: Anybody who immediately (upon joining the server) and/or constantly asks for more privileges should be immediately suspect. While the chances are they are just impatient
* **Mutes**: If someone joins/builds on your server for a while without talking, just the casual ""hey what's up"" is good).
* **Hold-My-Hand's**: These are those 12 or 13 year olds who non stop ask for help, but some of them may grief inadvertently or out of frustration because they lost their items in lava or weren't spawned those diamonds.


Following these tips will not prevent griefers from knocking at your door

*Edit*: On the topic of [mcbans](http://mcbans.com/), I know that there are admins out there who ban anybody who disagrees with them.

**How fast can you win ordinary Minecraft?**

Let’s be honest. When you play on a normal survival map you can get to diamonds under 15 minutes and you probably have everything you ever need in a day. And then you’re so bored you try to blow up your friend’s house. Is this everything Minecraft has to offer?

How about you try some Flatcore.

Flatcore is a **hardcore survival** on a **superflat map**. Imagine a huge grass ocean

Flatcore is a game of smarts and logic. To create a safe base and powerful gear you have to use multiple renewable mechanisms available in game. You probably tried making charcoal but did you know you can use mushroom blocks as fuel? Have you ever been so lost and hungry in Nether you started a waterless melon farm in a cave? Did you know how to light a nether portal without flint &amp; steel? You will

But that’s not all. **When you** (inevitably) **die

It’s a 1 hour timeout in an eerie place where you can try to beat challenges to be released early. Finish the vertigo-inducing Parkour or win the brand new and vicious [Death Pit](http://i.imgur.com/HEvimc1.jpg) to be released and keep playing. So don’t even think about killing yourself to replenish hunger. Survive at all cost!

Flatcore is a player versus environment kind of a game so come online and have some fun with us.

_(Yes

**Unique features:**

1. Your skill decides of your rank. A completely unique take on ranks where you do weekly challenges to get points and climb the ladder of promotions.
2. Staff plays legitimately among players. If we have to help
3. Completely custom and automated system for resetting villages. You can join whenever and you will still be able to find unraided villages.
4. Players who wish to support the server don’t get pay-to-win perks. We hate those. A lot of perks can be achieved by playing as well.
5. A balanced and expanded loot system with a few [custom structures](http://i.imgur.com/FeNEgzF.jpg) providing food

* *Rules*: You must be mature and follow our chat guidelines (no hate speech

**We’ve been running Flatcore for a year now; if you live &amp; breathe survival

I wanted to be paranoid

My ideal server right now would run sort of like this:

 * Run like hell from spawn in some direction.
 * Get as much wood as quickly as possible
 * Dig a hidey-hole in some unassuming spot and seal it off.  Keep it a goddamn secret at all costs.
 * Gather goodies
 * Find other bases, then burn it/blow it up.
 * Repeat until we have the audacity to carve a golden skull into some clearly visible cliff face.
 * Trap said garishly decorated base.  Cackle madly as siege members die.

1283947955.0,db2dz,[Guide] Running a Public Server,Wayward1,21,3,5,"I hope this is OK to put here. I speak from my own experiences running a large public server

This advice is for people who want to start and run an SMP server for PUBLIC users to join and the things you will need to think about. It's been updated to make sense for the latest server software 1.3.2 and client 1.0.17_04.

** The Hardware **

Minecraft shouldn't need a really good system, very quickly. 

* Playing a public server on a home computer only works if you're looking at under 10 player slots and not being able to use your computer for much else. You'll also need at least 4GB of ram and a decent CPU. Otherwise

* Shared servers are NOT an option for Minecraft as it loves to bug out and use a massive amount of system resources. You need to get a dedicated

* It's not all about playerlimit but what you're doing in the game. You'll use more resources discovering new land or setting things on fire than you will just sitting near spawn and building a house.

** The Software **

Anyone who thinks SMP is 'buggy' has obviously never had to deal with the server software

* It'll get buggier the more you use scripts

* The server loves to 'hang' rather than 'crash' when something goes wrong. This means you don't always know when things have happened until you try to log in. It makes auto restarts difficult as well

* Several things will currently totally rape the server software. Minecarts are likely to lag or crash clients and the game and large scale fires will utterly destroy a server. Map backups can also take a fair amount of resources.

* Backups are 100% necessary however. Map corruption WILL happen. It's happened to use once and to every server owner we know at some point. Generally it will happen from map generation

** The griefers **

Public servers will get griefed. This is unavoidable

* The BEST solution, or you can run a semi-private server that has 'public days' when you know you or other staff will be online. 

* Or you can set up spawn as a 'jail' made from bedrock which people are stuck in until you teleport them out. This can work well but it's an extreme measure

* The third option is to use a rank system where different items are banned. On our server, see below.

* [World of Minecraft](http://www.worldofminecraft.com/Minecraft_Griefers) has a list of 'known griefers'. You put this in your ban list to ban about 8

* The only real way to stop griefers on a public server is to have plenty of staff and users who are willing to help repair problems and report griefers. Even using a ranking system people can still mess up the world if they are determined enough or not caught quickly.

** The Mods **

* Server mods are VITAL if you want to properly run a server. There are plenty around and people use a different mix. Here's some of the ones we use

[Llamacraft](http://www.minecraftforum.net): Fixes all the really bugs with SMP right now

[Hey0](http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=1012&amp;t=23340): Adds a bunch of fixes and moderator / server commands that are very

[Simple Server Wrapper](http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=1012&amp;t=27756&amp;hilit=spiegal): Not widely used but this has been amazing as a firewall to ban blocks from certain users. Using this script has massively reduced griefing in our server.

* The more mods you use

** The Management **

Running and maintaining a server is one thing

* Run a website, which people really like and very few servers actually do. You can also put your rules online and refer people to them rather than trying to explain them every time.

* Get staff. Promote trusted players to use more commands, we have around 25 staff members, including 3 people with direct access to the server and always look for more.

* Decide on a focus and stick with it. Try to be original

* Make your rules and stick to them. On a public server you don't want to be too strict. Don't make rules you can't possibly enforce.

* Don't be an asshole. This sounds simple but you would be amazed how many members of the Minecraft community forget. Nobody wants to play on a server run by someone who acts like an tyrant or lets everyone get away with griefing. Be friendly, what's the point?",,False,self,t5_2s3kg,True,,

**Description:** Bloopcraft is an RPG styled private minecraft community. We're currently undergoing some heavy changes.  The server's core gameplay is still standard SMP and we won't be changing that... However we're adding elements that will help the world feel more like a bustling RPG and less like an empty sandbox.
Here are some of the things we're incorporating that add on to the vanilla experience:

* Economy: Most server economies command based, but the inventory is set by the player. This plugin blends seamlessly into the world allowing players to trade while offline.

* Towns: We don't use towny or any other border setting plugins (with the exception of the world border). Instead we're taking a different approach to building, or build in the wild.

* Pvp &amp; Factions: Faction plugins are bulky so we've decided against all faction plugins. Instead factions will be verbal agreements. Made some friends on the server and now you want to play together? feel free to call yourselves a faction

* Anarchy: A second overworld that gets reset often. The purpose  of the anarchy world is to bring fresh resources (we have a border set on the world and don't plan on restarting it). There are no rules on the anarchy world so thieves will try to take your resources. Having a faction allows you to work together while gathering resources to bring back to the main world

* Events &amp; Quests: There are a wide range of server events that are planned and scheduled to give players extra activities outside of the norm. Quests will normally be incorporated into dungeons which will automatically switch players into adventure mode. These will reward players with both experience and emeralds to the players.

* Lore: We're writing a backstory to the server and plan on having books scattered throughout the land similar to the elder scrolls universe. Some of these will hint at quests
These are just some of the things we're incorporating

**Rules**: No Grief/Theft!; No profanity; No advertising; No exploits; No Mob Grinders; Respect your peers.

The mods that are under 15 years old like to abuse their power.  There was a group of 8-10 of us on the server and 3 were taking advantage of a voting glitch that A. got the server more recognized, as long as they were out of the lottery.  Mods did not like that our group then started working together to make money and buy plots in a city together.  They would teleport to us all of the time while strip mining and continue warning us that we would find too many diamonds...

Anyway first experience that I had with getting in ""trouble"" was minor grief

Next day I log on I'm stuck in a giant prison made of bedrock with 4 signs saying along the lines of ""your group has too much money from working together

Last straw was hours after I was out, because I found too many diamonds.  He checks my progress and tells me I'm in the clear(just to clarify I mine in one direction until I find lava, then just change to left or right all while mining in a 2x2 square)  A few minutes later another mod teleports to me and checks on me, I ask him what was wrong, no more than 2 seconds later I'm banned for ""hacked client this was your last chance""

... In the span of 2 days I went from normal jailed to banned

**Website:** [damNation.eu](http://damNation.eu)

**Server Address/IP:** *damNation.eu:25565*

**Game Play Types:** A bit of all-in-one: PvE/Adventure/Survival/Build-friendly/Creative/Projects/Survival Games/PvP games/SkyBlock/Parkour/The Dropper etc.


**Description:** Age limit 15+! No Map Resets! Very Build Friendly settings! Protected Building! High Quality Special Projects! Adventures with custom adventure setup! Treasure Hunts! Full View Distance! Lots of Redditors ...and the Friendliest Staff and Community you will ever find! Tourists may play ""Freedom"" (survival world with Grief Prevention)


**Rules:** 

**Important rule #1**: This server is intended for mature adults with more than half a brain and we expect EVERYONE here to behave accordingly. You must be at least 15 years of age to be considered for membership.

**2.** Be courteous and respect others. Agree to disagree. No fighting

**3.** Real world legal and societal laws and rules apply! Just use your common sense

**4.** No exploits, stealing, griefing etc. You get ONE chance not to do that on this server! That means no cheat clients, especially no xray/ore finders. Cheaters, thieves and vandals do not belong here. We log all block and chest interactions and will BAN you! Do not peek into chests that belong to someone. Treasure chests (marked and notified on opening) are per player and you are expected to loot those when found (we have quite a few hidden).

**5.** Leave the landscape looking natural and beautiful please. Terraform to your hearts content, floating junk midair, screwed up water or ugly beaches/deserts anywhere please.

**6.** No giant pixelart, flags etc (statues and real ""builds"" are ok) in the regular worlds (creative play area is the only place you may build those).

**7.** Build with some taste please: Avoid large featureless walls/floors of cobble/dirt/birch/lava etc.

**8.** Aim to build within reasonable distance from each other. Minimum distance before it is customary to ask for permission is 128 blocks (=Normal Render Distance)

**9.** Make sure large redstone creations or machinery is turned off when not in use. We have a very powerful server

**10.** Always obey the admins &amp; moderators (red color names). Report misbehaviour, pm's, or mumble. Do no bother them unnecessarily, and NEVER EVER bother us for op or admin rights.

**11.** Do not spam or do commercials for other servers or any commercial services. 

**12.** You will be eligible for a FREE protected plot in the main city. You have 10 days to have a proper building there (square wood/cobble box is not proper) after which it may be taken back to the state and given to someone else (extensions only on special circumstances). The free plot may be dug to bedrock

**13.** Mobtowers/XPgrinders etc are allowed in MODERATION. Preferably with an off-switch, we have EasyEnchant, so there is little use for excessive XP grinding.

**14.** On your application to enter the server: Take the key number from rule #1 (in bold) and ADD it to the key number (also in bold) from rule #8

**15.** Before starting to ask a lot of questions, chances are someone will answer it. Please do not repeat or spam questions again and again in the chat.


**Server Hardware:** 16GB i7 2600k (Datacenter 100mbit). 100/100mbit in EU central datacenter with excellent backbone connectivity - giving good ping from all over (chosen with care). We have players from all over and we like it that way.

To be clear, it's just a massive superiority complex situation for the admins.

And before anybody says ""Moderators are required for an anarchy server to work right! Otherwise hackers would mess things up!"" I'd like to present 2b2t.net as evidence that NoCheat and an antispam plugin such as Spamhammer are more than enough to keep gameplay fair. And there are no moderators.

* **Description**: 

Welcome to the Blocktopia server cluster, introducing lava survival, zombie survival, and TNT combat.  Each one of these servers has enjoyed long-term success, but as the classic minecraft community continues to lose support and interest the Blocktopia devs have been hard at work recreating each of these servers for premium Minecraft. The result has been the development of four unique minecraft servers:  

* **Rituals of Fire [Lava Survival PvE]** 

* **Army of Darkness [Infection PvP]**

* **BuildBox [Creative]** 

* **Journey to Elysium [SMP]**

Each one of these servers may be accessed through the central hub at **lobby.blocktopia.net**

This lobby is a new development

Once you connect to the lobby

**If you wish to return to the lobby and select another game type


Descriptions of the individual servers are as follows:

* **Rituals of Fire [PvE]**

Rituals of Fire is an upgraded lava survival experience.  Here players must cooperate and work together to escape and survive the rising lava tides.  The server contains a collection of survival maps and a main lobby.  Players have the option of sitting rounds out and working on their gear in the main lobby, and the server will broadcast when the next wave begins.  Each map has its own twists and turns.

Players who survive the lava are rewarded with cookies, enchantments, and special crafting rooms.

In between rounds players are encouraged to duke it out on King of the Ladder.  Whoever sits atop the ladder the longest is awarded various goodies.  If you die you retain your items so don't stress out.

Some impressions here [http://imgur.com/a/RETsV](http://imgur.com/a/RETsV)

* **Army of Darkness [PvP]**

Army of Darkness is the replacement for the classic Zombie and TNT wars servers.  The gameplay is infection PvP with a minecraft twist.  Maps are randomly selected from a pool of about 40, and hunt down items located in chests throughout the map.  After time is up, the survivors are no longer able to gather resources and a Dark Hunter is randomly selected.  Survivors who die are transformed into hunters, and the round continues until either all of the survivors perish or the round time expires (6-10 minutes).

Each map is designed to focus on a different gameplay aspect

Renders of a few of the AoD maps may be seen here: [http://imgur.com/a/4vW2a](http://imgur.com/a/4vW2a)

* **BuildBox [Creative]**

Both of the two previous servers feature multiple maps created within the community.  To encourage new map makers and provide a creative outlet for the community the BuildBox is available for any would-be mapmaker or anyone who simply wants to build something amazing.  Here players are allowed to create their own plots in which they are allowed access to WorldEdit commands (and VoxelSniper for the trusted players).  

Anything built here may be exported as a schematic and downloaded at the community site

The livemap may be seen here: [http://smp.blocktopia.net/buildbox/#](http://smp.blocktopia.net/buildbox/#)

* **Journey to Elysium [SMP]** 

This final server is also the newest and most popular, a booming emerald economy, and PvP + PvE regions.  This allows players to focus on building their worlds without fear of griefers thanks to various plugins, or cross the great ice wall into the PvP regions and duke it out.  Established villages and towns are marked on the livemap.

* **Rules**: Rules vary per server, griefing, personal insults, and general asshattery are universally discouraged across all of the Blocktopia servers.

* **Server Hardware**: Dedicated
* **Plugins**: Too many to list.  Multiple custom plugins.
* **Owner/Admins/Moderators**: GmK, Marnixxie, Malcovent, Uhtr5r, Ogarci, dirtcake and Baker93 serve as (head) admins for various aspects of the community.

On the server, every weekend or so, we have an Events server which we use to host various adventure maps or PvP arena type games (for example, we've had our version of the Hunger Games in Minecraft and we also have a Race for the Wool League planned for the future) for the community to enjoy. We also have a whitelisted survival server for members of a certain rank.

Our staff of over a dozen active moderators, devs and admins are experienced (majority of which having moderated for over a year and all been playing since Alpha or early Beta), just, and, take this as you will


The server has no whitelist, as such not everyone will get a rank up; donating money to us, though very welcome and encouraged, is not a necessity in advancing through the ranks and unlocking new tools (you are instead given different cosmetic perks ingame for recognition). If you wish to build on the server and join our community, I invite you to read all the signs ingame and consult our forums for more detailed information. Be warned, we don't accept all new players, though if you are an even remotely good, patient and understanding builder


Make sure you understand the rules! The basic ones are: use common sense, and don't use any client modifications not specifically approved in our forums. Ingame, type ""/help"", ""/faq"", and read the signs in spawn to get you started! A forewarning though: we don't take kindly to immature and asinine behaviour. Please don't act like a typical conceitedly entitled 14 year old.

We have a great staff, homophobia or any of that nonsense, and we don't spawn blocks and mess with users for fun.

We have zero tolerance for griefing and stealing and have plugins and staff to deal with things. It's very rare a staff member isn't online

We don't accept donations or give donators more powers than regular users

We have a number of plugins installed to make life easier, and tend to only use one that fix problems or are in the spirit of Minecraft. We also have our own custom code to integrate forum activity, whitelist users, administrate and make things easier for players.

We have a large 'carebear' zone for people who don't want to fight monsters all day and just like to build

A small strictly survival Minecraft server on a new map (one week old) looking for new players to join our almost 2 year old community (usually 6-10 players online).,Azander137,42,29,168,"*Obligatory formatting for the rules of this subreddit (Read below for a more accurate description of our server


**Server Name**: LittleDigPlanet

**Website**: www.reddit.com/r/LittleDigPlanet

**Server Address/IP**: 66.85.135.226:25587 (white-listing required)

**Game Play Type/s**: Vanilla SMP

**Description**: A legitimate vanilla SMP server with 5-10 players on at max times

**Rules**: Use common courtesy (players that can't figure that out don't stay on our server).

**Server Hardware**: 1GB of RAM

**Plugins**: WorldBorder (set at 15k), DeadBolt, LogBlock, MobileAdmin (no plugins to break the vanilla gameplay).

**Owner/Admins/Moderators**: alexkohnen (Azander137), and LaLaLauren107

**Pictures/Videos URL**:http://imgur.com/a/iR4Jq

**Other**: We haven't really been looking for any new players since the release of patch 1.5, but skip to the TL;DR if you'd rather read that.



-.

Anywho

-.

So you’ll probably want to know exactly how we play. We run a strictly 1.5 (1.6 soon, and even we play legitimately on a different accounts, as to not abuse the Operator powers. 

Our #1 goal in running this server is to keep it as vanilla as possible, DeadBolt, logblock, etc. We even disable /home and /spawn commands to ensure this. You set your house on fire? Well, you're going to have to fix it, just as you would in vanilla single-player. Our philosophy is, if you go out hunting, and the only way to set your spawn point is by using a bed.

An important note to mention about our server is MobGrinders; long ago



-. 

**Our definition of 'griefing' and PvP rules** are as follows: Griefing is defined as 'causing grief unto another player' which could mean anything from destroying their build (obviously)

We use to run the server with an free-roam/no rules PvP system

However! If you like to have the persona of some sort of hermit



-.

As far as age is concerned, then cool. It's not like we're going to ban someone who we find out is 15 or 16, it just comes down to how you act. We don’t need any 12 year olds running around being a nuisance.  If someone is always being annoying repeatedly saying things like, “OMG I found DIAMOND!” or, “OMG! A creeper!” or asking, “Who can I build with? Can I build with you? Who wants to be my friend??” they’ll likely not last long with us. We’ve had people like this in the past, and they just get on everyone’s nerves and get booted (but it's also for these requirements that we've built a strong community).

-.

As I mentioned earlier, and it isn't difficult at all to find somewhere to build and get started. 

Some other miscellaneous information I guess I should include is we currently run with 18 slots, and zombies break doors.  We also have a world-border set at 15,000 in every direction from 0,0. It should also be noted that our maps are not permanent. We do server resets every once in a while, usually with every other new patch, or every 6 months. It helps rejuvenate everyone and bring back players. Resets are healthy for a community.That is all I can think of to put here for now, but that’s the rundown of how we play. Now that you've got an understanding of our server and what we are about, or moderator mail on our subreddit and tell us about yourself! There's no set in stone requirement for joining us

-.


**TL;DR** (*But you should still read the whole thing!*)


* Strictly Vanilla SMP running version 1.5 (will be patch 1.6 in a few days

* Minimal plugins; only used for protective reasons

* Been around for over 2 years

* 6-10 players online at peak times 

* Server map was reset when Minecraft 1.5 came out.

* [**This is a screenshot of our small spawn village**](http://imgur.com/a/iR4Jq)

* No player ranks; everyone is equal

* On our server

* If you die and lose your items

* No 'annoying 12 year olds'. Must be at least be 18 years old

* We play on 'Hard Difficulty' (Starvation drains your hearts and kills you; zombies break your doors)

* 18 slot server

* Online 24/7

* Server is hosted by DaddyCheese.com

* White-list enabled

* No mob grinders. This is a hard-mode server. Go somewhere else if you don't want to play it like one.

* No SMP map is permanent, or around every 6 months. 

* Check out our subreddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/LittleDigPlanet/

* **If you'd like to be white-listed, or use moderator mail on our subreddit. Be sure to tell us about yourself; there's no set in stone requirement for joining the server, just make sure you don't make yourself out to be a complete idiot! The more you tell us about yourself, the better chance you have of being accepted. :)**

* **Server Address/IP**: greenbay.gbunetwork.com

* **TeamSpeak3**: ts.gbunetwork.com:10022 (password: diamond)

* **Game Play Type/s**: PvP

***

* **Description**: Green Bay Minecraft is a tight-knit server, PVP Arena, Mall (with user shops) and a School for non-combat skill training.  All players are safe from PvP in or near spawn and PVP is disabled for the first 30 minutes.  Check PVP timer with /pvptimer check and you have the option to remove your own PVP protection early if you choose.  Once you join the server you will spawn in the ""House of Spawn"", everything you need to know is on the roof.  In the basement there is a casino with a few slot machines, Notch who repairs your tools, weaps and armor and of course the server jail.  There is a Nether Portal in the span house and in the basement there is an End portal but it's hidden so you have to be clever or ask a fellow Minecrafter for a hint.  A live world-map can be found on our website, this shows the entire 3,000 world with faction and region territories highlighted.  Creating a faction costs $5

* **Rules**: This is a ‘no warning’ server, your faction 'max power' increases, factions have a max of 20 members. Random killing is allowed, bullying is not. Random occasional killing of another player to take whatever loot they drop is acceptable but killing the same player over and over is not. When you kill someone you get their head and you can wear it or use it as a decoration in your home or shop, they are quite fun to collect. Repeat killing is only allowed during a raid or in self defense if your victim keeps coming back at you. My advice to all users, just act like you would in RL and ‘hopefully’ you won’t get killed.. much. When a player kills another player, the killer can keep whatever the victim drops, destroy it or sell it off, etc.. If you are caught using any mods you will be insta-banned, you will probably be banned. Mods can ban anyone at anytime for any reason. All bans are final

We are a 100% no nonsense Minecraft server. Mostly vanilla except for anti-grief/cheat and some warps are set up to alleviate the longer walking distances. We are moderated 24/7 with highly manipulable rollbacks installed to ensure there won't be any long-lasting damage caused by griefing. Our moderation team won't hesitate to kick or ban at the slightest sign of bullshit or douchebaggery.

Server Specs:

* 16GB DDR3 RAM
* 3.2 GHz 6 core processor
* 64GB SSD
* 1TB Western Digital HDD

We are hosted at the [Nexcess](http://www.nexcess.net/) data center in Dearborn, we can support well over 120 players, but until Minecraft's multi-core support improves our max caps out well before that.

Here at NoBullcraft you start out as a [Drifter] and advance your way up to [Resident]. Residents are more respected, don't be a dick, and most importantly, don't ask to become one! New Residents are selected democratically by current residents, via a voting process held by one of our Mods or Admins.

Our server runs solely on donations, donators will receive a special custom tag of their choice, as well as super awesome protected plots of land...and we sure love donators &lt;3

Any further questions can be asked and answered either in-game

We look forward to seeing you online!

* **SubReddit**: /r/TheDyingOfTheLight

* **Server IP:** 67.209.228.94

* **Game Play Type:** MC Version 1.6.2. Featuring a new map with many unexplored areas. A post-apocalyptic themed server with unique and custom plugins to reinforce a roleplay-centric and balanced game. No client side mods are required

* **Description:** 

Alright kids

You see, dark, cold heart was created to weed out the chaff. It's like that asshole coach who made you run laps until you puked because he wanted a winning team this season. It's going to eat you alive if you're not a decent Minecraft player. It's going to crush your soul and make you run back to Creative so you can build your pretty buildings. It's a **hard** server and you are going to hate it. 

The only solace I can offer you is that the map, intelligent players. It's hard so that the good players shine. We have given you the tools to build defenses. We have given you the tools to build real, impenetrable walls. Farmers matter because guess what? There's barely any dirt to farm on. Ores are prevalent in only a few biomes, but come in spades for those adventurous to find them. Mountain biomes from 0-254y, made of radiation emitting blocks make roads matter. Even the damned sun is out there to burn players without their full leather suit, making any above ground travel something to plan for. In a nutshell, strategy matters for once! 

Use your noggin and you will rule. Play like a spastic griefer and you will die. That's how the game is played. 

There's a ton of info in the [**manual**](http://www.dyingofthelight.net/Manual.html) about our gameplay changes, and our approach to justice. You will not find a server like this anywhere. We are unique. Listed below are some tidbits to help prime you. 

1. The map is 10, custom with an average surface height of 180y, and giant caves. You spawn in the NW area of the map. There are no spawners, no villages, no End portals, no successful Nether portals, no Mineshafts

2. Sunlight will burn you unless you're wearing a full leather suit. You get a free one on login. The second one will be yours to make. Days are three times as long.

3. You get a free kit on spawn &amp; respawn. It will contain some essentials. Don't waste them.

4. Radiation is almost everywhere

5. Rad-X can be crafted using food and water bottles. There are a number of unique crafting recipes.

6. You die. You go to Hell, or boring the Gods while in Hell. Craftable life tokens soon to come.

7. We use a chat limiter. Only players within range can hear you.

8. Coordinates won't work. We have radios

9. Special mobs with special drops populate the map. Do not underestimate the mobs.

10. There are two special worlds that have replaced the Nether and the End. Hell and a special area where you can do battle to win free lives. It's out there

11. Potatoes grow everywhere

12. Tesla coils can be built for use against enemies. 

13. Imprisonment/Slavery exists. More hands on than PrisonPearl it will allow you to capture players. Play nice.

And the list goes on. You got the basics. Your best bet? Find some form of civilization. Find some torches. Introduce yourself. It's a hard server

* **Rules:** Chaos. The few rules that govern play are for cheating and reinforcing a roleplay environment. See the [**rules**](http://www.dyingofthelight.net/rules.html) page on the website for all rules.

* **Server Hardware:** 4 GB RAM

* **Active Plugins:** AutoSneak, Irradiated, Sunburn, StackableItems, Extrahardmode, CakesRadio, TeslaCoils

The 'Arrow-Limiter' plugin is a Greysoul exclusive plugin, as of now, as are some exclusive mcMMO features added just for you guys. Paid for by player donations to make this server better, for you the player. This will continue to be the way as the plugin developers listen to our feedback and tweak them to make our PVP experience one of balance and fun. As long as we have donations

**mcMMO

A RPG plugin that grants unique skills and a leveling experience to players. Chose from one of many Professions and Weaponskills to upgrade and alter the way you fight in PVP Combat! Never before seen abilities to liven up the stale sword and bow spam!


* Weapon Skills: Play as an Orsanian Soldier or Archer! Let your swords wreak havoc while you parry enemy attacks and/or bleed your enemy!
* Choose to be a Raghnall Berserker and rush into battle with a massive battle-axe cleaving your enemies in two with critical hits! *Raghnall has been training hard to combat the soldiers of Orsana and have adapted in ways of the sword as well.
* Professions: Herbs your thing? Come harvest wheat and mushrooms to gain a chance to double proc
* Digging in the dirt and sand since childhood? Well Excavation may be your thing. Find useful items as you keep that childhood innocence alive
* ""I'm a lumberjack and I'm OK. I sleep all night and I work all day"" Cut down the trees faster than ever before and also gain a chance to gain double procs on your wood harvesting business...
* Is climbing tress and scaling heights a rush for you? Try your hand at acrobatics and learn the skill of tumbling. Never again worry about the mountains of Raghnall! Leap upon your foes from the cliff tops!
* (Mercator only) Only one of our Empires are skilled and/or crafty enough to master the delicate work of armor and tool repair! *Craft an anvil and get to work! Repairing your tools from a hard day of battle, this repairs a MASSIVE amount of durability with only one piece of raw material!
* (Donor Only) Minecraft is all about the Mining... We all know it and love or hate it. It needs to be done to fuel the warmachine! Iron and Diamonds that are destroyed or lost in battle must be replaced! Purchase them with your rupees or replenish them on your own. Either way the Miner skill will let you mine faster and more fruitful than ever. At Higher levels it will double proc all ores for you... and yes EVEN DIAMONDS!


**Arrow Limiter**

No more are the archers of this world, while the melee classes rejoice. Fear not archers, with slower speeds comes higher damage. Each arrow at its base has been increased to 3 hearts. Increase this even more if you join Orsana and choose Archery as your weapon skill.


**Vampirism**

A sickness has befallen the world of Greysoul... Those who survive the sickness are forever changed. Cold to the touch, darting and dashing after their foes! Even the monsters of the night are fearful of them, choosing to ignore their presence. The priests of Greysoul may have found a cure but it is not cheap, and those who are turned may not always want the cure. Choose to be a prince of the night, or forever have a wooden weapon on hand!

Come watch the champions of each Faction fight it out in the great Coliseum! They shall battle Monsters of all shapes, or even Each other! Before the battle begins take and place bets with each other or with the house. Win your weight in rupees! Enjoy the Bloodshed!


**The Maze and The Minotaur:**


Enter a labyrinth of twists and turns, or find your life forfeit by the end of the Minotaur's sword. If you reach the end of the massive labyrinth you are certain to find a handsome reward! Perhaps you will be chosen to act as the Minotaur, hunting down the maze-runners one by one to keep them from your hoard of treasure! Either way the spectators will have a blast placing bets on the Maze Goers or the Minotaur. A glass roof lets us all watch as the minotaur closes in on each player!


**Weekend Extravaganza:**

Sunday Sunday Sunday! Come to the Coliseum every SUNDAY!!! Monster Truck Rally.... err wait... no... Every Sunday we meet together for blood shed, Team fights, Player Vs Monster, and Last Man Standing! A great way to break from the norm of killing, looting and pillaging. Weekend Events break up the monotony of the normal Minecraft server.

A RPG plugin that grants unqiue skills and a leveling experience to players. Chose from one of many Professions and Weaponskills to upgrade and alter the way you fight in PVP Combat! Never before seen abilities to liven up the stale sword and bow spam! This coupled with the faction system grants each enemy different strategies in combat!

* Weapon Skills:
Play as an Orsanian Soldier or Archer! Let your swords wreak havoc while you parry enemy attacks and/or bleed your enemy!

* Choose to be a Raghnall Berserker and rush into battle with a massive battle-axe cleaving your enemies in two with critical hits!
Raghnall has been training hard to combat the soldiers of Orsana and have adapted in ways of the sword as well.

* A new enemy approaches! The Dwarves of Castillona (Cast e- ona)

* Professions:
Herbs your thing? Come harvest wheat and mushrooms to gain a chance to double proc

* Digging in the dirt and sand since childhood? Well Excavation may be your thing. Find useful items as you keep that childhood innocence alive

* (Donor Only)
Minecraft is all about the Mining... We all know it and love or hate it. It needs to be done to fuel the warmachine! Iron and Diamonds that are destroyed or lost in battle must be replaced! Purchase them with your rupees or replenish them on your own. Either way the Miner skill will let you mine faster and more fruitful than ever. At Higher levels it will double proc all ores for you... and yes EVEN DIAMONDS!

  **Vampirism**

A sickness has befallen the world of Greysoul... Those who survive the sickness are forever changed. Cold to the touch, darting and dashing after their foes! Even the monsters of the night are fearful of them, chosing to ignore their presence. The priests of Greysoul may have found a cure but it is not cheap, and those who are turned may not always want the cure.

Chose to be a price of the night



  **Music Craft:**

Play musical compositions using note blocks. [Want to play Gold Saucer from FF7](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFTRelKQxSc&amp;feature=player_embedded#at=32) without using 100 note blocks? Well now you can!



  **New Faction

A wild Dwarf appears! Fight? Run? ...err wait..... A new Dwarven faction has been spotted in the wild. These stout soldiers of the mountains are a vicious nature and wield Axes or simply punch things to death

-Player ranks based on trustworthiness (Peon, Priest, Elder, Saint, Templar, Holy Spirit, God) NOT A RELIGIOUS SERVER.

-Kits (Deluxe sets for Priests)

-Monsters are turned OFF until health is server-side. No point in wasting CPU cycles on something that doesn't work. (you can still see them in dungeons though)

-There is a 160 unit protection radius on the spawn zone. Nobody but Templars/Admins can build here.

RULES:

-Obviously

-Build your buildings at a decent distance from other buildings

-TNT is for use by Priests and above only. If you need something blown up ask someone.

-Asking for priesthood or modship automatically disqualifies you for it.

* **Description with Pictures!**:  http://imgur.com/a/OfAMu  &lt;- Step by step explanation of the servers.

---

* **Description**: 

Welcome to the Blocktopia server cluster, introducing lava survival, zombie survival, and TNT combat.  Each one of these servers has enjoyed long-term success, but as the classic minecraft community continues to lose support and interest the Blocktopia devs have been hard at work recreating each of these servers for premium Minecraft. The result has been the development of four unique minecraft servers:  

* **Rituals of Fire [Lava Survival PvE]** 

* **Army of Darkness [Infection PvP]**

* **TNT Wars [TNT PvP]**

* **BuildBox [Creative]** 

* **Journey to Elysium [SMP]**

Each one of these servers may be accessed through the central hub at **lobby.blocktopia.net**

This lobby is a new development

Once you connect to the lobby

**If you wish to return to the lobby and select another game type


Descriptions of the individual servers are as follows:

* **Rituals of Fire [PvE]**

Rituals of Fire is an upgraded lava survival experience.  Here players must cooperate and work together to escape and survive the rising lava tides.  The server contains a collection of survival maps and a main lobby.  Players have the option of sitting rounds out and working on their gear in the main lobby, and the server will broadcast when the next wave begins.  Each map has its own twists and turns.

Players who survive the lava are rewarded with cookies, enchantments, and special crafting rooms.

In between rounds players are encouraged to duke it out on King of the Ladder.  Whoever sits atop the ladder the longest is awarded various goodies.  If you die you retain your items so don't stress out.

Some impressions here [http://imgur.com/a/RETsV](http://imgur.com/a/RETsV)


* **TNT Wars [PvP]**

Our newest server addition and the fastest paced. TNT Wars is a reincarnation of a classic counterpart of the same name, lightning attacks, ""Axetinguisher""s and more) that are all special and help you gain an advantage over your opponent.

On TNT
Capture the flag. This is the classic game we all know. Try and sneak into the teams base and bring their flag back to yours. Watch out though. When you're holding the flag
Control Point. Stay in the control point for as long as possible and rack up points for your team. It's quite small though
Words can only say so much... Check out the trailer for all the information!

 [TRAILER](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=EU-aGnKq6xM)

* **Army of Darkness [PvP]**

Army of Darkness is the replacement for the classic Zombie and TNT wars servers.  The gameplay is infection PvP with a minecraft twist.  Maps are randomly selected from a pool of about 40, and hunt down items located in chests throughout the map.  After time is up, the survivors are no longer able to gather resources and a Dark Hunter is randomly selected.  Survivors who die are transformed into hunters, and the round continues until either all of the survivors perish or the round time expires (6-10 minutes).

Each map is designed to focus on a different gameplay aspect

Renders of a few of the AoD maps may be seen here: [http://imgur.com/a/4vW2a](http://imgur.com/a/4vW2a)

* **BuildBox [Creative]**

Both of the two previous servers feature multiple maps created within the community.  To encourage new map makers and provide a creative outlet for the community the BuildBox is available for any would-be mapmaker or anyone who simply wants to build something amazing.  Here players are allowed to create their own plots in which they are allowed access to WorldEdit commands (and VoxelSniper for the trusted players).  

Anything built here may be exported as a schematic and downloaded at the community site

The livemap may be seen here: [http://smp.blocktopia.net/buildbox/#](http://smp.blocktopia.net/buildbox/#)

* **Journey to Elysium [SMP]** 

This final server is also the newest and most popular, a booming emerald economy, and PvP + PvE regions.  This allows players to focus on building their worlds without fear of griefers thanks to various plugins, or cross the great ice wall into the PvP regions and duke it out.  Established villages and towns are marked on the livemap.

Would Anyone be Interested in a Creative Server Dedicated to the Building of the Land of Ooo from Adventure Time? (X-Post from r/minecraft)",4,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcservers/comments/il7qc/would_anyone_be_interested_in_a_creative_server/,"[Here is the original thread. Most discussion and updates are happening here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/il2b7/would_anyone_be_interested_in_a_creative_server/)

~~**UPDATE:** We have a guy that can host. He says he can't make it dedicated

**UPDATE 2:** There's a Redditor here that may be able to set up a dedicated server for us, so keep your fingers crossed. I encourage you guys to go to the crappy [forums](http://atmc.lefora.com/) I set up and get started there. The forums will just be for collaborating, sharing ideas, announcements, etc. They aren't necessary, but sign up if you want as it will make things easier. Keep hoping my man can get this server up!

**UPDATE 3: We are live! Come join us at landofooo.dyndns-server.com:25567 and the forums at atmc.jadons.com!**

I was visiting Minecraft Middle-Earth and it got me thinking. Wouldn't it be sweet if we could recreate the Land of Ooo from Adventure Time in Minecraft? Who would be interested in such an idea? There's a lot of potential

* The center of the map
* Finn and Jake's [Tree Fort](http://adventuretimewithfinnandjake.wikia.com/wiki/Candy_Kingdom) could be a fun thing to build. There are landmarks around the area there that would be fun to create too.
* [Marceline's House](http://adventuretimewithfinnandjake.wikia.com/wiki/Marceline%27s_House) could be build in a huge cave.
* [Lumpy Space](http://adventuretimewithfinnandjake.wikia.com/wiki/Lumpy_Space) could be created in the Nether
* The [Ice Kingdom](http://adventuretimewithfinnandjake.wikia.com/wiki/Ice_Kingdom) would be great to build in a snow biome
* Then there's the [City of Theives](http://adventuretimewithfinnandjake.wikia.com/wiki/City_of_Thieves_%28location%29), [Boom Boom Mountain](http://adventuretimewithfinnandjake.wikia.com/wiki/Boom_Boom_Mountain), and [all these other places.](http://adventuretimewithfinnandjake.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Places)

New locations are constantly being added

tl;dr I'm looking for a free, where people are responding the most. If you want to help find or host (or host yourself!) please respond or PM me.

EDIT: Another idea hit me. If this did get rolling

EDIT 2: Further ideas submitted so far. Will be updating as comments come.

* Using the Skylands mod for Lumpy Space. Great idea. Waiting for the sky dimension idea being developed by Notch to be officially released might be more rewarding
* The maze from [The Limit](http://adventuretimewithfinnandjake.wikia.com/wiki/The_Limit)
* Tree Trunks' and Lady Rainicorn's house
* Land of the Dead or the Nightosphere could be in the Nether

EDIT 3: [Here](http://imgur.com/9Sz4T) is a *very* rough approximation of what the tree fort could look like. Now that it's possible to place leaf blocks

EDIT 4: **IMPORTANT!** I made a request on the Minecraft forums for someone to host for us. Hopefully someone will respond. [Here it is.](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/456611-looking-for-host/)

EDIT 4a: I've asked around on the Minecraft forums. It seems there are some people who wouldn't mind us building Ooo on their server

EDIT 4b: I'm still looking for a free host that'd be dedicated. No real luck so far.

**Overview:**

Greysoul is a community of active Minecrafters who have ascended into a world of battle and intrigue. The player base frequently participates in daily raids, chaotic brotherhood of Viking warriors, and shrewd Merchants. With the recent update to the Towny plug-in, it is now a better time than ever to join in this world as the Empires begin to expand outward from their home territories to uncontested lands. How will you forge your legend in this world of power and devastation? Come fight for glory, or build your name atop a mountain of gold. Earn your titles as you slay the enemy, strike down on the Tyrannical King and his legions, if you dare; or drive back the Viking hordes and wild beasts of lore untold. Whatever side you choose

**Server Perk:**

Every server you have been a part of has died off, giving feedback, getting adjustments, and/or developing ENTIRELY new plugins. The 'Arrow-Limiter' plugin was developed as a Greysoul exclusive plugin, then later released to improve other servers. The well known plugin, mcMMO, which was developed by Nossr50, are in constant communication on how to better mcMMO. What this means to you is our server is the breeding ground for new idea's and improvements of one of the best RPG - Leveling plugins

New plugins developed just for Greysoul are paid for by player donations to make this server better

***
##!NEW FEATURES!##
***

* Chaos PvP in the Nether
* 3 new Classes w/ quests! (Priest
* More Cities to choose as your home!
* Mudders Milk (Get drunk on Milk!)

**mcMMO

A RPG plugin that grants unique skills and a leveling experience to  players. Chose from one of many Professions and Weaponskills to upgrade and alter the way you fight in PVP Combat! Never before seen abilities to liven up the stale sword and bow spam!

***
##Classes and Skills##
***

* Swordsman
* Axeman
* Brawler
* Archer
* Mage (New Class!)
* Tamer (New Class!)
* Priest (New Class!)

Check out [this Imgur link](http://imgur.com/uf0mD?full) for a quick description of the Classes.

**New Classes!**

**Priest:** Love that feeling that YOU are the reason your teammates survived an ambush? That YOU and your buff on the swordsman are what caused a gank to go so well? Then look no further! The Priest could very well be the perfect class for you! Use your holy book to Heal

**Mage:** 'A 7 inch wicker wand is all I need to make my maidens love me' With the mage class, and blink away from the brunt of the damage! With lots of new spells being added constantly, this is becoming a very popular class! Get it while you can Harry!

**Tamer:** Harness the power of nature itself, and develop stronger bonds than glue itself. Fido will follow you into battle and loyally strike down any who have the audacity to oppose you. Unlike normal wolves, Fido will respawn after dying, with a short cooldown of course. Never feel lonely again, yet you are alone, so very, very alone...

***
##!NEW PLUGINS!##
***

**Arrow Limiter**

No more are the archers of this world, while the melee classes rejoice. Fear not archers, with slower speed comes higher damage. Each arrow at its base has been increased to 3 hearts. Increase this even more if you join Orsana and choose Archery as  your weapon skill.

**HookShot** (Donors Only)

See a need, then select string and right click, you will be yanked to the arrow. Use it to scale walls, Escape or chase down people in PVP. Go spelunking, shoot and zip anywhere your heart desires!

**Runecraft**

The Legendary SSP plugin ported over into SMP. Craft runes on the ground using Redstone, and voila. Useful and fun runes for the entire server to use. Examples being: Zeerix Chest, summon a chest to your location grab some items and then return that chest back to its orginal spot. Another? Well sure, Phantom Torch, a few simple redstone and a few torchs, creates a magic floating torch that follows you where ever you go, the duration is dependent on the Key Tier rune you use upon creation. These are just 2 examples of the many different runes you can cast!

**ItemCraft**

Itemcraft is a SMP port for SSP plugins. This AMAZING plugin allows SSP plugins like but not limited to, and Mo'Creatures to be ported over into SMP. Yes, thats right, I said Mo'Creatures on a SMP server. Before we get ahead of our selves I will explain the other 2 we have on our server.

* kSlopes: Allows for slanted blocks, giving your creations a totally unique, and unblocky feel to them.

* FancyPack: FancyPack adds many new items and designs to the game. Chairs, decorations, hidden wall panels, and much more!

* Mo'Creatures: One of the most famous SSP plugins that spawns lions and tigers and bears, rideable, and breedable horses (Horses are currently buggy in SMP)

Toro League is a Minecraft roleplay server for a fictional setting in the Pokéverse. The Toro Region

We're a growing community that currently has over 200 registered members on our forums with an average of 15 players online during a weekday. There is a white-list application but that is primarily to ensure that the community understands the bare minimal for roleplay. The current server can easily handle up to 50 players with pokémon flying enabled and we're currently in the process of updating our server to 1.6.2.  

I also personally make the server's texture pack myself to ensure the best RP immersion possible. It will automatically prompt you when you login to download the texturepack. 

Join us today for a fun easy time that doesn't involve killing each other!

**Server Name**: LittleDigPlanet

**Website**: www.reddit.com/r/LittleDigPlanet

**Server Address/IP**: 66.85.135.226:25587 (white-listing required)

**Game Play Type/s**: Vanilla SMP

**Description**: A legitimate vanilla SMP server with 5-10 players on
at max times
information.

**Rules**: Use common courtesy (players that can't figure that out
don't stay on our server).

**Server Hardware**: 1GB of RAM

**Plugins**: WorldBorder (set at 15k),
DeadBolt
gameplay).

**Owner/Admins/Moderators**: alexkohnen (Azander137)
(Snorlaxian)

**Pictures/Videos URL**:http://imgur.com/a/iR4Jq

**Other**: This write-up
should adequately describe what we're all about. Hopefully it'll give
you a great idea of how we play
about us and if we're really the server for you. I suggest reading everything
to ensure this is the place you want to play
you'd rather read that.



-.

Anywho
we began as a group of Real Life friends just looking to play together
online. We’ve been around for over two years now (since beta 1.6) and
won't be going anywhere anytime soon. The current map we are playing
on now was fresh with the release of patch 1.5 back in March/May of
2013. [**You can see a couple pictures of our small spawn area
here.**](http://imgur.com/a/G4gRo) There aren't any rules for building
around spawn
it's not completely obnoxious or impeding on other players of course.

-.

So you’ll probably want to know exactly how we play. We run a strictly
1.6 Vanilla Survival Multiplayer server on regular
biomes. **No one on the server receives any sort of handouts
there are no players who are higher ‘ranks’ than others.** No one can
pay their way to be an admin/moderator. There are only four admin
accounts to moderate the server
different accounts

Our #1 goal in running this server is to keep it as vanilla as
possible
server. These plugins include WorldEdit/Guard
DeadBolt
ensure this. You set your house on fire? Well
fix it
if you go out hunting
back; it’s an adventure
by using a bed.

An important note to mention about our server is MobGrinders; long
ago
amount of mob-spawns in the overworld. We decided to outlaw them
completely here on LittleDigPlanet. If you're the kind of person who
likes to sit AFK to grind XP and items
you. **This is a hard-mode survival server. Go somewhere else if you
don't want to play it this way.**



-.

**Our definition of 'griefing' and PvP rules** are as follows:
Griefing is defined as 'causing grief unto another player' which could
mean anything from destroying their build (obviously)
chests

We used to run the server with a free-roam/no rules PvP system
we play to hang out and be friends
who just wants to kill everyone. Go to a chaos server for that.

However! If you like to act as some sort of hermit
what-have-you
who enters will get a warning broadcasted to them and will be open for
free reign PvP. Anyone who dies in one of these zone is expected not to cry about it.



-.

As far as age is concerned
like you're at least 17 or 18
younger than that but **act like your at least 17 or 18**
It's not like we're going to ban someone we find out is 15 or 16
it just comes down to how you act. We don’t need any 12 year olds
running around being nuisances.  If someone is always being annoying
repeatedly saying things like
creeper!” or asking
wants to be my friend??” they’ll likely not last long with us. We’ve
had people like this in the past
nerves and get booted (but it's also for these requirements that we've
built a strong community).

-.

As I mentioned earlier
biome world with the release of patch 1.5. Lately we've had about 6-10 players on at peak times
is still by no means full of giant cities or anything. The beginning
area is very new
build and get started.

Some other miscellaneous information I guess I should include is we
currently run with 18 slots and are hosted by daddycheese.com out
of New York. There is a white-list and we play on the **‘hard’**
difficulty setting (starvation kills you)
We also have a world-border set at 15
It should also be noted that our maps are not permanent. We do server
resets every once in a while
every 6 months. It helps rejuvenate everyone and bring back old players.
Resets are healthy for a community.That is all I can think of to put
here for now
got an understanding of our server and what we are about
you're still interested in joining) send me a private message
moderator mail on our subreddit and tell us about yourself! There's no requirement set in stone for joining us
**you're** about. I'll probably at least look at your Reddit comment
history to make sure you're not a complete idiot as well.

-.


**TL;DR** (*But you should still read the whole thing!*)


* Strictly Vanilla SMP running version 1.6 

* Minimal plugins; only used for protective reasons

* Been around for over 2 years

* 6-10 players online at peak times

* Server map was reset when Minecraft 1.5 came out.

* [**This is a screenshot of our small spawn
village**](http://imgur.com/a/iR4Jq)

* No player ranks; everyone is equal

* On our server
player. It's not just destroying peoples work.

* If you die and lose your items

* No 'annoying 12 year olds'. Must be at least be 18 years old

* We play on 'Hard Difficulty' (Starvation drains your hearts and
kills you; zombies break your doors)

* 18 slot server

* Server is hosted by DaddyCheese.com

* White-list enabled

* No mob grinders. This is a hard-mode server. Go somewhere else if
you don't want to play it this way.

* No SMP map is permanent
map resets (as we just had one). Some people get upset with resets
but it's a necessarily evil. It helps rejuvenate the community and
bring back old players. We have resets every couple patches
every 6 months.

* Check out our subreddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/LittleDigPlanet/

* **If you'd like to be white-listed
private message
tell us about yourself; there's no set in stone requirement for
joining the server
complete idiot! The more you tell us about yourself
you have of being accepted. :)**


Hope to hear from you soon!

 Here at Minecraft Junkie we just love Minecraft and playing it, you may build right off the bat and we have no builder rank.

 Also, so everyone can play the game and not worry about their builds and items. Also our staff are promoted to playing just like you, they do not spawn items and we keep the true vanilla feel.

 We are very centered around the idea of a community. We have many towns, and whole civilizations of people working together to survive in the world of Minecraft. Each community can do whatever they please. They can institute their own economy system, make their own community storage, create farms, have leaders, make jobs, literally anything. This is what makes Minecraft Junkie so great

*     A few plugins that help aid the experience (things like mcmmo, etc)

On the server, every weekend or so, we have an Events server which we use to host various adventure maps or PvP arena type games (for example, we've had our version of the Hunger Games in Minecraft and we also have a Race for the Wool League planned for the future) for the community to enjoy. We also have a whitelisted survival server for members of a certain rank.


The server itself has many features, and a group of fantastic, tight-knit and mature members. Our staff of around a dozen active moderators, devs and admins are experienced (majority of which having moderated for over a year and all been playing since Alpha or early Beta), just, and, take this as you will


The server has no whitelist, as such not everyone will get a rank up; donating money to us, though very welcome and encouraged, is not a necessity in advancing through the ranks and unlocking new tools (you are instead given different cosmetic perks ingame for recognition). If you wish to build on the server and join our community, I invite you to read all the signs ingame and consult our forums for more detailed information. Be warned, we don't accept all new players, though if you are an even remotely good, patient and understanding builder


Make sure you understand the rules! The basic ones are: use common sense, and don't use any client modifications not specifically approved in our forums. Ingame, type ""/help"", ""/faq"", and read the signs in spawn to get you started! A forewarning though: we don't take kindly to immature and asinine behaviour. Please don't act like a typical conceitedly entitled 14 year old.

Notice that this is not the complete plugin list

I *just* started with this, it's because i haven't thought this a 100% through yet :)

The idea of the server is to have some serious roleplaying going on. Permissions, countries, lords, kings and stuff like that shall be used a lot. 
If somebody wants to be a mage, the ender dragon. A player who wants to be a warrior will not have these abilities, yet he will be able to use weapons and armor more effectively. A scout/spie or ranger might be able to transform into whatever the *passive* mod they'd like. A werewolf could transform into a wolf. 

I have an idea about how the storyline is going to work, in shape of *""At some point, dwarfes are going to attack humans, but we don't know when. Maybe when we get enough troops. It should be done by the end of this week though""*. Kinda like in real life - you can't really plan anything.

If any of you have feedback on this, and take this just a tad serious, otherwise we aren't going to get anywhere with this.

We are a white-listed, but more in the form of political anarchy rather than every flag-burning 13 year olds idea of anarchy. We do run Bukkit for one purpose, that is to run a WorldBorder around our map to keep it in a uniform shape/size - Which we expand as needed.


We have a fairly active playerbase and have been running the server for 3 months strong now. The server is located on dedicated server hardware in a datacenter with plenty of RAM and bandwidth/speed so in theory we could even expand past 64 players.


There is an active Mumble VoIP server for our players to use for Minecraft and other games (we've actually turned into a rather good gaming community) and the Minecraft server is available 24/7 with near-constant administration.


We are planning to re-launch our Vanilla server with a clean map for everyone to start their civilizations on 11/11/11 or whenever Notch/Mojang decides to release - So right now the server and player population is a little dead but it will certainly kick up again.

1294600926.0,ez2tf,Improve Minecraft Server Performance,TnTBass,16,5,17,"[Now Edited to mesh with these instructions for Bukkit.](http://www.reddit.com/tb/f2y7f)

I started my quest to improve performance from being annoyed with the ""[Warning] Can't keep up! Did the system time change, 6GB RAM, 40 GB HD.  Full backups daily, incremental backups every hour.  Nothing fancy, but not shit either.  

My quest is not over, eventually.  I will update these instructions as things change, or I discover more/better things to do.  

Feel free to use the following tips and tricks I have found.  Most of these revolve around using the java server itself (minecraft_server.jar)

I will also focus my attention on GNU/Linux (specifically Ubuntu 10.10 x64) as that is what I've found to best allow me to do everything I need.  Any x64 GNU/Linux would do.  As would any x64 version of BSD, or Windows.  Everything I will mention is possible in all OS's, however, my instructions will be focused on a single one.  Also, links I provide I found to be the most helpful for me.  Your Google foo may differ.

First, as its unused in Ubuntu, so I could put Minecraft, c10t, Java, etc, all as subdirs of /opt.

For my Ubuntu setup
&gt;sudo swapoff -a

The most common tip

Here are a few examples, start.sh for bukkit) Ex:

    java -Xms2G -Xmx2G -jar minecraft_server.jar nogui
    java -Xms3072M -Xmx3072M -jar Minecraft_Mod.jar nogui
    java -Xms2048M -Xmx2048M -jar minecraft_server.jar nogui
    java -Xms2048M -Xmx2048M -jar craftbukkit.jar nogui

Next trick is to run the world inside a RAM disk.  Now, but it becomes much faster.  BEFORE you create this ramdisk, you need to move your world to a different folder.  Once this ramdisk is mounted, the world folder will be empty (or so it appears - you can unmount the ramdisk to see the files if you haven't moved them out).

Below assumes Minecraft is ""installed"" in the /opt/minecraft folder.
Add this line to your /etc/fstab

&gt;ramdisk /opt/craftbukkit/world tmpfs mode 1777

Or if you are running hMod:
&gt;ramdisk /opt/minecraft/bin/world tmpfs mode 1777

Or if you are running vanilla
&gt;ramdisk /opt/minecraft/world tmpfs mode 1777

On reboot
&gt;sudo mount /opt/craftbukkit/world


Or
&gt;sudo mount /opt/minecraft/world

Or
&gt;sudo mount /opt/minecraft/bin/world

Now, or /opt/craftbukkit/world folder, and you should be able to start up your server.  I gave the ramdisk 512 MB because, shit, why not?  I only use 137 MB right now, but I like to know I have plenty of room to grow.  If I get close to exceeding that, I'll increase it.

Here are the scripts I use to start and stop my server.  Remember, so at worst you will lose an hour.  These scripts, together perform the following tasks:

1. Set ownership of ramdisk folder
1. Copy the world from the HD world area (named backup in my case) to ramdisk.
1. Run the script: server_nogui.sh which launches the server.
1. Once server_nogui.sh finishes (server stops, run the script stopserver.sh which removes the stale HD staging area, recreates a fresh HD staging area and moves the files from ramdisk to the HD staging area.

I found when I remounted the ramdisk, but I didn't want to risk it.  Scripts assume they are located in the /opt/minecraft, or /opt/minecraft/bin directory, and you run them from there as well.

startserver.sh looks like this

&gt;#!/bin/sh

&gt;sudo chown -R &lt;user for minecraft&gt;:&lt;group for user&gt; /opt/minecraft/bin/world

&gt;cp -r backup/world ./

&gt;./server_nogui.sh

&gt;./stopserver.sh

server_nogui.sh looks like this:
&gt;#!/bin/sh
&gt; java -Xms 3072M -Xmx3072M -jar Minecraft_Mod.jar nogui

stopserver.sh looks like this:
&gt;#!/bin/sh

&gt;rm -r backup/

&gt;mkdir backup/

&gt;mv -r world/ backup/

These above scripts can be condensed into one if you should choose (example below for Bukkit server):

&gt;#!/bin/sh

&gt;sudo chown -R &lt;user for minecraft&gt;:&lt;group for user&gt; /opt/craftbukkit/world

&gt;cp -r backup/world ./

&gt;java -Xms 3072M -Xmx3072M -jar craftbukkit.jar nogui

&gt;rm -r backup/

&gt;mkdir backup/

&gt;mv -r world/ backup/

We've got a solid

A little about the server:
 
Specs-

* Server Type: SMP (Survival Multi-Player) 

* Mods: Hey0

* CPU: AMD Phenom II X6 1055t

* Memory: (4GB DDR 1333)

* Graphics: Nvidia GTS 250

* Hard Drive Space: 3.64TB

* WAN: Comcast Cable (20mb down

* Location: Western IL

* Active 24 hours a day 7 days a week

There are three admins, remote or on site, to the server.  This is a relatively vanilla server, minus the Hey0 mod, so there is no spawning of blocks/items.

We don't have a white list, we've had one griefing incident, which was caught within 5 minutes of it happening and I personally rebuilt the member's home for them.  Applications typically take anywhere between 5 minutes to 24 hours to be approved, dependent on if one of us are in game at the time.  I always check the applications nightly.

We have two main, with a planning thread in our forums.  Our current spawn point will start you in this new city, however there are Hey0 warps to our initial community area.  There is also a google map of our server on the website that was last updated 4 days ago.

I will be on for another 2 or 3 hours tonight

Today I will be discussing how our Secret Shoppers verification is going to work. Last week in the [Community Poll](http://redd.it/xbtda) the community voted to form a group of ""Secret Shoppers"" that would go into servers and check to see if a server meets it's tagged criteria.

Some main points of this program that I want to talk about:

* **Secret Shoppers will never identify themselves

* Anyone who outs themselves as a Secret Shopper will be removed from the program.

* /r/MCServers Moderators will not be part of the program.

* Do not ask to become a Secret Shopper

* We will post a Google Docs list of verified servers and give verified posters a flair indicating so. 

* This program will take up to 2-3 weeks to get ready to launch (I do have a job).

This iteration of Valikorlia was made after the owner of our old server shut it down. A dedicated group of other players then took the opportunity to re-evaluate, and launch the next Valikorlia. Many of our current players were so dedicated to the community that they took the risk and invested their time and effort into making this new server just as good as the old one.

Valikorlia uses a plethora of mods and plugins to enhance the pillars of Minecraft play: Mining, while still staying true to the game's roots. The RPG plugin Heroes has been extensively tweaked by our admins, with each class built from the ground-up, and is designed to have a unique playstyle. iConomy is used as a superstructure for the server economy by providing a currency and shops. Towny allows players to make towns, form alliances/rivalries, go to war, and secure territory for themselves. We also have dungeons for groups and individuals to level in, not-tedious leveling experience.

As a player myself, the community is also lively, and as such, there is always enough drama to keep things interesting in the game, and for town politics to really have a purpose. Check our server out. You won't be disappointed.

We are a 100% no nonsense Minecraft server. Mostly vanilla except for anti-grief/cheat and some warps are set up to alleviate the longer walking distances. We are moderated 24/7 with highly manipulable rollbacks installed to ensure there won't be any long-lasting damage caused by griefing. Our moderation team won't hesitate to kick or ban at the slightest sign of bullshit or douchebaggery.

Server Specs:

* 16GB DDR3 RAM
* 3.2 GHz 6 core processor
* 64GB SSD
* 1TB Western Digital HDD

We are hosted at the [Nexcess](http://www.nexcess.net/) data center in Dearborn, we can support well over 120 players, but until Minecraft's multi-core support improves our max caps out well before that.

Here at NoBullcraft you start out as a [Drifter] and advance your way up to [Resident]. Residents are more respected, don't be a dick, and most importantly, don't ask to become one! New Residents are selected democratically by current residents, via a voting process held by one of our Mods or Admins.

Our server runs solely on donations, donators will receive a special custom tag of their choice, as well as super awesome protected plots of land...and we sure love donators &lt;3

Any further questions can be asked and answered either in-game

We look forward to seeing you online!

**Rules:** No Hacking **(THIS INCLUDES XRAY, No Spamming
Allowed: Killing
Monsters: Enabled


**The spawn town is a safezone and is protected by a 125 block radius. **


Our server objective: Kingdoms at War is a Minecraft SMP server that aims to create an engaging experience for hardcore winner-takes-all type of pvp players through team warfare. The Kingdoms At War server has a protected spawn town and only has a few rules including no hacking, fortresses, and more. In addition, players can raid, loot, and destroy other towns and fortresses to gain wealth and wage war against other factions. We highly encourage players to band together for protection and attacking other groups. If that isn't your cup of tea that's fine, you can do whatever you wish in this server


It has been a month or more since we have started and the server's quality has increased a lot since then.
We are extremely active in catching cheaters and xrayers and have numerous plugins installed to help catch these people. We also have our own unique plugin for team management and chat installed! The team plugin doesn't add any annoying features or permissions though


Also our server is **lag free!** The server is located in texas


**TL:DR:  In our server players form teams (or don't if they don't want to) and make bases and raid other team's bases

Right now me and a few people I have invited from Reddit and other places (6 or 7 people so far) have slowly started to build the city of Aldona.

Here is the album: http://imgur.com/a/X43IE Note that a lot is still under construction and we are no where near done. Multiple people have projects going on.

If you would like to join the server please PM me on reddit but please note our following rules:

We are trying more here to create a community - right now we have little restrictions as in anyone can pour water or lava (fire is disabled) as well as public storage and a community that is helping each other.

- No random exploring. You can explore for a bit but try not to go too far as it makes the map bigger and can cause lag as the server software is still pretty buggy. (14mb map so lots to be explored still)

- If building within the city limits please try and make your building fit in with local architecture but we arn't anal about this many people have different buildings

- If you want to build a public building make sure to just ask in chat and see if its ok and let the community have a say in it - we all like to help out on ""community builds"" I guess you could say.

We arn't strict but are just looking for people who want a smaller community of trusted people (no griefers) all working together.

So if your interested let me know.

EDIT - I will be inviting a few people at a time so as to manage the new players and to make sure no griefing occurs.

EDIT 2 - We have had a lot of people interested and a lot of newcomers so if you havn't recieved an invite yet don't worry.

* **Description**: Minecraft Risk is a game of total war. Teams fight for control of a territory map

Territories are generated and defined over top a minecraft world.  The territories defined can be claimed by your team by being within the territory for some time.  Each territory has a perk assigned to it (*shown on an item frame*).  Every territory with a similar perk will stack up in level to give you better gear.  Claiming territories and killing other players will sometimes give you tokens which can be used to purchase items and power ups throughout the game.

All tokens won, click the Diamond in your inventory.  Mousing over the Emerald will show you your token balance.

Each team gets a private chat channel.  The command `/ch t` will take you to it.  The command `/ch g` will put you back into the global chat channel.  Use the command `/risk help` to see a full list of current commands.

On death

To win the round, Award Tokens will be given to the victor, and a new board will be chosen randomly based on the amount of players online.

*Please report any bugs to the admins.  All known bugs from Beta release have been resolved.*

There is also a Factions server featured.  Tokens won on the RISK server

* **Joining**: Go through the Lapis portal in the lobby to join the Risk server.  The Obsidian portal will take you the the Factions server.  The command `/server` will show you a list of available servers you can join.  You can join any of the servers in the group by doing `/server &lt;name&gt;`.

* **Rules**: No Cheating. No advertising. Be Respectful to other players and staff.

* **Website**: www.ugbattle.com

* **Server Address/IP**: greenbay.gbunetwork.com

* **TeamSpeak3**: ts.gbunetwork.com:10022 (password: diamond)

* **Game Play Type/s**: PvP

***

* **Description**: Green Bay Minecraft is a tight-knit server, PVP Arena, Mall (with user shops) and a School for non-combat skill training.  All players are safe from PvP in or near spawn and PVP is disabled for the first 30 minutes.  Check PVP timer with /pvptimer check and you have the option to remove your own PVP protection early if you choose.  Once you join the server you will spawn in the ""House of Spawn"", everything you need to know is on the roof.  In the basement there is a casino with a few slot machines, Notch who repairs your tools, weaps and armor and of course the server jail.  There is a Nether Portal in the span house and in the basement there is an End portal but it's hidden so you have to be clever or ask a fellow Minecrafter for a hint.  A live world-map can be found on our website, this shows the entire 3,000 world with faction and region territories highlighted.  Creating a faction costs $5

* **Rules**: This is a ‘no warning’ server, your faction 'max power' increases, factions have a max of 20 members. Random killing is allowed, bullying is not. Random occasional killing of another player to take whatever loot they drop is acceptable but killing the same player over and over is not. When you kill someone you get their head and you can wear it or use it as a decoration in your home or shop, they are quite fun to collect. Repeat killing is only allowed during a raid or in self defense if your victim keeps coming back at you. My advice to all users, just act like you would in RL and ‘hopefully’ you won’t get killed.. much. When a player kills another player, the killer can keep whatever the victim drops, destroy it or sell it off, etc.. If you are caught using any mods you will be insta-banned, you will probably be banned. Mods can ban anyone at anytime for any reason. All bans are final

The basic premise is that you spawn in a random location in the world


*Death results in a 6 hour ban

The white-list helps reduce the number of griefers and hackers

We run just a few major plugins, which you have to pay for by collecting gold and other resources, then travel with it to our server ""bank"" to sell it. This trip can be dangerous, so you have to learn to always be alert. People have established several towns, and started building roads between them, as well as to the bank. We also have a mail system to help make global communication possible, while still fitting with the theme. You can mail letters

We have several active players, destroyed, and moved. With the new 1.2 update coming out soon we will be expanding the map area, and many towns are planning to move their bases further out into the new areas.  So now's a great time to join.

Once you're out of the spawn there is no going back and you will have to fight to survive. On death you are kicked out of the server and must wait 3 hours before you can come back. In terms of gameplay anything goes so be on your guard at all times. My only request is that you don't use exploits or hacked/modded clients to gain unfair advantage.

Hi there

DrFunkesMC is a 24/7 Survival Server

**Plugins and Server Details**

DrFunkesMC runs close to vanilla, griefers can't hurt you! Our admins have various tools to detect and undo griefing of any sort. Every user has the ability to lock their own chests, so only you can access your own items.

Just like was mentioned in the title, as well as creeper damage. Both the Nether and The End are accessible as well.

**Moderating Style and Rules**

We don't let the crazies run our server, #mc. We don't spawn items, for anyone, not even ourselves. Every block we have has been mined by hand, we play fair on this server.

We're also very open to questions, or bothering you, we aim to fix it. Just let us know, we don't bite.

A well written and detailed Rules and Code of Conduct can be found on our website (check the tabs to find all our pages)

**How To Apply** (In case you missed it above.)

Applying is easy! All you have to do is visit our [website](http://drfunkesmc.com:8088/blog/) and fill out the Whitelist Application

We are a 100% no nonsense Minecraft server. Mostly vanilla except for anti-grief/cheat and some warps are set up to alleviate the longer walking distances. We are moderated 24/7 with highly manipulable rollbacks installed to ensure there won't be any long-lasting damage caused by griefing. Our moderator team won't hesitate to kick or ban at the slightest sign of bullshit or douchebaggery.

Server Specs:

* 16GB DDR3 RAM
* 3.2 GHz 6 core processor
* 64GB SSD
* 1TB Western Digital HDD

We are hosted at the [Nexcess](http://www.nexcess.net/) data center in Dearborn, we can support well over 120 players, but until Minecraft's multi-core support improves our max is around 40-50 players playing simultaneously.

Here at NoBullcraft you start out as a [Drifter] and advance your way up to [Resident]. Residents are more respected, don't be a dick, and most importantly, don't ask to become one! New Residents are selected democratically by current residents, via a voting process held by one of our Mods or Admins.

Our server runs solely on donations, donators will receive a special custom tag of their choice, as well as super awesome protected plots of land...and we sure love donators &lt;3

Any further questions can be asked and answered either in-game

I'm looking for some nice regulars just looking for a nice virgin server to build on.  Or to go have some adventures and explore.  Basically I'd love to make the server as ""multiplayer"" as I can.  The one aspect of Minecraft that makes me feel so lonely in the game is the lack of interactions with other humans.  Sure there's always an army of Creepers out there ready to hug me

I also don't like having/using what I view as ""cheats"", /tp is active, as well as a few /kits, but that's to cater to some of the players on the server.  I would really love to remove them, but I don't want to drive away the few players that are here.  If I can enough people who enjoy playing MC like I do, I feel that will be the appropriate time to remove these ""cheats"".

I'd love to have a community going, or see what they build.  I don't really care about any specific theme or anything, build whatever you please.

Despite the hostile introduction, so you actually have enough time to open your chat bar. Also, griefing is allowed, but not encouraged. The map is hard enough without players attacking eachother. Their is a protection plugin to help focus attention on PvE and not PvP/raiding. Protection is easy to use, but it is limited.

* **Server Address/IP:**  minecraft.gameserv.co:26061
* **Game Type:**  Survival (Extra Hard)

~~--------------------------------------------------------------~~

* **Description:**  If Minecraft has gotten too easy and you want a challenge this is the place to be.  You're all but guaranteed to die here.  Server difficulty is massively ramped up from vanilla settings and there are several gameplay changes in effect.  Our goal is to provide an atmosphere where individuals can enjoy a strong and challenging PVE survival atmosphere while still being able to engage in PVP outside of the spawn city walls if they choose.  For those seeking a simpler life free of monsters &amp; PVP they have the option of working to become a citizen and building inside the city walls where these features are disabled.  They will however need to suffer with everyone else until Citizenship is earned.  Those choosing to live outside the city walls will continue to remain immune from PVP when standing within their claims.  There is however a cost to living far away - convenience.  There is only one warp on this server (/spawn) and it's on a lengthy cooldown.

**NOTE:  mcMMO has been tuned drastically down from default settings for balance.**

**NOTE:  There are no donation perks.  There are no donations at all.**

**NOTE:  There are no handouts or advantages given period.**

A few notable gameplay changes:

* 1)  Mobs are much more plentiful.
* 2)  A variety of additional blocks are impacted by gravity.
* 3)  Cave-ins are very real risk of mining.
* 4)  All mobs have new abilities and immunities.
* 5)  The deeper you dig the more dangerous it becomes.
* 6)  Crops have a chance of dying.
* 7)  Buckets can't move water source blocks.
* 8)  Pigmen are always hostile.
* 9)  Etc.

* **Rules:**  Have fun but be respectful.  Individuals found to be cheating (this includes X-ray), it's okay for people to get upset from time to time but don't go out of your way to be a dick.  Raiding unprotected chests is allowed.  Destruction of other people's builds just because you can however is not.  We've provided the tools necessary to protect yourselves and if people choose to not use them it's their responsibility.  Chain killing and spawn camping will also not be tolerated.

**Important rule #1**: This server is intended for mature adults with more than half a brain and we expect EVERYONE here to behave accordingly. You must be at least 15 years of age to be considered for membership.

**2.** Be courteous and respect others. Agree to disagree. No fighting

**3.** Real world legal and societal laws and rules apply! Just use your common sense

**4.** No exploits, stealing, griefing etc. You get ONE chance not to do that on this server! That means no cheat clients, especially no xray/ore finders. Cheaters, thieves and vandals do not belong here. We log all block and chest interactions and will BAN you! Do not peek into chests that belong to someone. Treasure chests (marked and notified on opening) are per player and you are expected to loot those when found (we have quite a few hidden).

**5.** Leave the landscape looking natural and beautiful please. Terraform to your hearts content, floating junk midair, screwed up water or ugly beaches/deserts anywhere please.

**6.** No giant pixelart, flags etc (statues and real ""builds"" are ok) in the regular worlds (creative play area is the only place you may build those).

**7.** Build with some taste please: Avoid large featureless walls/floors of cobble/dirt/birch/lava etc.

**8.** Aim to build within reasonable distance from each other. Minimum distance before it is customary to ask for permission is 128 blocks (=Normal Render Distance)

**9.** Make sure large redstone creations or machinery is turned off when not in use. We have a very powerful server

**10.** Always obey the admins &amp; moderators (red color names). Report misbehaviour, pm's, or mumble. Do no bother them unnecessarily, and NEVER EVER bother us for op or admin rights.

**11.** Do not spam or do commercials for other servers or any commercial services. 

**12.** You will be eligible for a FREE protected plot in the main city. You have 10 days to have a proper building there (square wood/cobble box is not proper) after which it may be taken back to the state and given to someone else (extensions only on special circumstances). The free plot may be dug to bedrock

**13.** Mobtowers/XPgrinders etc are allowed in MODERATION. Preferably with an off-switch, we have EasyEnchant, so there is little use for excessive XP grinding.

**14.** On your application to enter the server: Take the key number from rule #1 (in bold) and ADD it to the key number (also in bold) from rule #8

**15.** Before starting to ask a lot of questions, chances are someone will answer it. Please do not repeat or spam questions again and again in the chat.


**Server Hardware:** 16GB i7 2600k (Datacenter 100mbit). 100/100mbit in EU central datacenter with excellent backbone connectivity - giving good ping from all over (chosen with care). We have players from all over and we like it that way.

**Plugins:** 100+ plugins at time of writing

**Owner:** OriginalMadman   **Admins/Mods:** About a dozen in total. The red color names :). Always helpful and friendly. Our moderators are from Sweden

**Pictures:** Here are a few nice shader shots from the server: http://mbowman96.imgur.com/all/

Remember your place on the server

* Don't make extremely complicated redstone circuits that are intense on the CPU of the server
* Keep the server tidy! If you're in the wilderness
* Follow the rules for building set by your town leader if you're in a town.

Generally, simple as that. You might even be rewarded for it!

* To get health

* Recipes have changed.

* A golden apple requires gold ingots instead of gold nuggets.

* A glistering melon requires a gold block instead of a gold nugget.

* This functionality is all server-side.  No need to modify your client.

*If you die


  Welcome to Jackal's Den.  A Ultra Hardcore Deathban competition server.  A game is always going on

  This is based off of the youtube ""Mindcrack Ultra Hardcore"" series.  What is Ultra Hardcore?



  The game ends once somebody had achieved one of two goals.  If you're into PVP and such then get 50 PVP kills and you win the game!  If you like survival more then slay the Ender Dragon and bring the Dragon Egg to an admin and you will win the game!  Pvp is still enabled for you though so be careful!  Once the game is won

  The server is configured as close to a vanilla server as I could achieve with UltraHardcore.  This makes beds important again.  The only non-vanilla commands are /spawn and /kit food.  The /spawn command will send you to spawn to view server news and be free from pvp for a moment.  The command has a 20 second warmup and 10 minute cooldown.  The /kit food command will give you a couple meat once in a while.  There are no other commands to help you.  Did I mention this is hardcore?

  Each game's champion will have their name added to a hall of fame at spawn.  Also you will receive a snazzy title in game so everyone knows how awesome you are.  Only one person can win a game.  Who's it gonna be?

40 Slots | Located in Chicago


[ Description ]
Team up, meaning mobs are set to the ""very hard"" setting. Mobs will do more damage. Poison, fire, and starvation will kill you. If you can survive the monsters, then watch out the players. Because they can and will try to kill you. Death is accompanied by a 12 hour ban from the server, and a lost of faction power. Players that can survive will be rewarded with higher faction power. Allowing them to claim more land and conquer more of the server. 

Faction bases do have protection with a few exceptions. Our server runs a plugin called ""Creeperheal"" allowing craters and other damaged caused by explosions and fire to heal after a amount of time. Bases are not immune to explosions or fire. Making tactics involving TNT launchers and lighters completely viable. Another object not protected is chests that are in faction territory. Whats the point of laying siege to an enemy base

You'll need to recruit scouts, and base attackers if you want to be successful. Can your faction be the champions of the realm? 

[ Spoutcraft ]
We do have Spout enabled on our server. If you use the wonderful Spoutcraft client you will gain many UI improvements that will help you enjoy the server. Such as faction tags, ally, or friend.

Spoutcraft is a standalone Minecraft client. What this means

Get Spoutcraft

[ Rules ]
We have a simple set a rules on our server. 

1) No hacks

2) Do not spam chat. 

3) Do not ask admins for handouts. 

4) Do not use any exploits

We want a fair environment here guys. That said

[ We Are New Disclaimer ]
Our community has been around for close to a decade. This is our first official Minecraft server. That said, IL, so if you live in say, New Zealand... You may have issues. Our website is currently being overhauled so expect a fresh site in a few days. We do have a both a ventrilo and mumble server for use by our community. Regulars on our server are welcomed to use it.

[Awesome Parkour Action](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZT35Nlnb98&amp;feature=youtu.be) with Smart Move Plugin!

---

**Overview:**

Greysoul has been ressurected! The world has been reset, or rebuild the ruins of the once great Order of the Silk Blade, as an Orsanian Knight.

The Greysoul server is a community of active Minecrafters who have ascended into a world of battle and intrigue. The player base frequently participates in daily raids, and a chaotic brotherhood of Viking warriors. With the factions plug-in, it is now a better time than ever to join in this world as the Empires begin to expand outward from their home territories to uncontested lands. How will you forge your legend in this world of power and devastation? Come fight for glory, or build your name atop a mountain of gold. Earn your titles as you slay the enemy, be a ninja warrior using the smart move plugin and crawl into places your enemies could only dream of, strike down on the Tyrannical King and his legions, if you dare; or drive back the Viking hordes and wild beasts of lore untold. Whatever side you choose

As an Admin and a Game Designer, I have 100% control and can modify it on the spot. No more waiting for a plugin to update, no more waiting for weeks to get a buff or much needed nerf. That being said I can not control somethings and plugin updates are still needed if things are a major change. I can add classes, change classes, tweak damage values, and ban or limit things that are unfair to PvP.

---

**Server Perk**

Every server you have been a part of has died off, giving feedback, getting adjustments, and/or  developing ENTIRELY new plugins. The well known plugin, mcMMO, which is currently beign developed by TheYeti, is one of the MAIN plugins on many RPG servers. The new MCMMO developer TheYeti and the Server Admin are in constant communication on how to better mcMMO. What  this means to you is our server is the breeding ground for new idea's  and improvements of one of the best RPG - Leveling plugins,  critique's and opinions are taken into account and put to good use. 

New plugins developed just for Greysoul are paid for by player  donations to make this server better


---

**Heroes**

Heroes is a dynamic, boasting classes, multi-tiered and fully fleshed out. Along with classes, Heroes offers your players a new style of PvP through our well-developed skill system and our weapon + armor restrictions. No longer will your mages have the ability to use diamond swords, your rogues will no longer sneak around in their heavy diamond tunics and most importantly, you can now hurl fireballs and stun your targets. The best part of this? It's your choice how your Heroes is set up, don't want a certain skill, you can just remove the skill and be done with it! We're working towards making everything about Heroes configurable.

---
**Classes and Skills**

---

**5 PvP Classes**

*Warrior* - Heavy Armor and beefy tank

*Rogue* - Stealthy leather wearer that can sneak at full speed and backstab his enemy for massive damage.

*Archer* - Leather Armor and ranged physical dps

*Warlock* - Ranged magic caster adept at slowing

*Cleric* - An armored holy Steward that can heal and buff their allies

---

**1 Non PvP class**

*The Merchant* - Can Set up shop to sell and trade goods

---

**Smart Move**

Ever wish you could leap across a ravine and instead of just missing your jump and falling to your death, you name it and you can do it in this plug-in. You ARE Indiana motherfucking-Jones.

**Hero Bounty**

Some players like to make a living toiling away in the mines of Greysoul

1322870912.0,my5tr,My guide to running a successful server [crosspost from /r/minecraft],theheyway,9,2,5,"I sent this to the /r/mcservers mods and they recommended I cross-post it here! It has also been sidebarred! Thanks

------


Hey guys, I thought I'd weigh in with this little helpful guide of my own personal observations.


**What's success?** First off, and I try to keep it that way.

-----


**Your server is a commitment to your players and its experience.** People want to feel like they belong somewhere when they play on a server--after all, etc. is worthless when everything gets wiped constantly. I don't know anyone who likes a server that has a world reset every month, or a server that they find and a week later shuts down. If you're running a server and you intend for it to be a success, **commit** to it. Buy yourself a VPS. Learn how to administrate your server. Learn what plugins do what, and the extent of them--hell, learn how to *make* plugins if you so feel the desire.


**Make people feel like they belong.** For me, want to stay. You want your players to be able to look back and say, ""I had a great experience on that server, I'd love to play again tomorrow, or when I have time."" It's like brand loyalty. You want people to feel like they're a part, and own it.


**Humor your players.** A lot of players who are more creative will want to engage people in power, the moderator or administrator. Sometimes, people make awesome stuff and want other people to see it. It doesn't matter who, but usually, you're the most capable and most able of giving recognition of what your players have done. Believe it or not, this is **so important**. If your players feel ignored, then they'll ignore your server.


**Be around, they don't talk much, and they just build away. Yet, you'll find that even these players tend to log off if they're the only one on. People are social creatures, even the introverts, who may socialize indirectly. Just having people around is always good; it makes people feel like a server is alive, that there's actually a community there. After all, then there's no point to playing multiplayer on Minecraft.


**Choose your moderators/admins wisely.** This is really important. I've heard tons of horror stories where people have been screwed over by asshole moderators or administrators and swear never to go back. Don't select anyone who's overly rude, and how they interact with other players. You want people you can depend on and trust.


**Be accessible.** This is a huge one. You want your website (if you have one) to be direct and up front--not annoying to navigate, make sure your spawn is comprehensible. Don't force people to read hundreds of signs--your server is not that important. If we're going to act like a dick, we're probably not going to read your signs anyway. Highlight the important things, and if you have to explain a lot, space it out with interesting things to look at. A lot of players want to just get to somewhere to build. Don't hassle your players for no reason.


**Give people something to do.** Not everyone is entirely self-motivated, sister, babysitter, father, mother, and doting grandparent all at once depending on who you're interacting with. Sometimes you just need to give people ideas, help them work on things, but giving people a push in the right direction helps individuals and promotes a great community spirit.


**Set rules and stand by them.** Don't bend your own rules. If anything, if you set certain rules and they're broken, punish appropriately (but not excessively). Make it clear that players should respect your server, or they should leave. It's that simple.


**Be humble, make sure that they don't abuse them or show them off excessively. It doesn't do any good for the community at large.


**Ultimately, and they'll probably be good to you.

SHUT UP AND LET ME PLAY: mc.midgardserver.net

Hello all!

Midgard is a survival server (24/7) with Bukkit and select mods.

We stay close to the vanilla playstyle while incorporating features that help the game feel fresh and user friendly.

The map is less than a week old so not much is explored.

We have a strict anti-cheat policy which is enforced by plugin NoCheat and an anti X-ray mod which obfuscates ores.

Activity is not huge

We have a strong administration team who are on at varying hours

We also offer a PVP and Creative map

We don't operate a whitelist policy, harassing, etc.) are dealt with equally quickly.

Also we have a website (linked above)

Please feel free to check out the website (the commands and features is ever so slightly out of date - in-game has them all

We look forward to having you!

P.S. When you inevitably have a good time on this server

We are hosted at the [Nexcess](http://www.nexcess.net/) data center in Dearborn, we can support well over 120 players, but until Minecraft's multi-core support improves our max is around 40-50 players playing simultaneously.

Here at NoBullcraft you start out as a [Drifter] and advance your way up to [Resident]. Residents are more respected, don't be a dick, and most importantly, don't ask to become one! New Residents are selected democratically by current residents, via a voting process held by one of our Mods or Admins.

Our server runs solely on donations, donators will receive a special custom tag of their choice, as well as super awesome protected plots of land...and we sure love donators &lt;3

I've got a brand new private SMP server and I'd like to invite some redditors to play in it. I'm looking for a few mature players who want to be creative and build while not messing with any existing stuff. I'd love to do some large co-op builds or you can do whatever really. I hate it but since this game is so very prone to griefing I am restricting access.

The first few comments saying they want in will get in and if things go well I will invite more later.

EDIT: After much deliberation I decided to implement a whitelist. Everyone who was already invited should be on the list. All new recruits will have to tell me their username when I accept them. 

EDIT2: There is supposed to be a client/server patch tomorrow. I will try to get the server back online ASAP as my time (and minecraft.net) permit.

**THE SERVER**

-24/7 Server

-Player limit: 12

-Player ranks based on trustworthiness (Peon, Mod, Super Mod, Admin)

-Kits (Deluxe sets for VIPs)

-Monsters are turned OFF until health is serverside. No point in wasting CPU cycles on something that doesn't work. (you can still see them in dungeons though)

-There is a 32 unit protection radius on the spawn zone. Nobody but Super Mods/Admins can build here.

RULES:

-Obviously

-Build your buildings at a decent distance from other buildings

-TNT is for use by VIPs and above only. If you need something blown up ask a Mod/Supermod.

-Asking for VIP or modship automatically disqualifies you for it.

-Backsass to mods is allowed

-No water or lava structures. This makes the server laggy.

* **Description**: 

The Server is running http://feed-the-beast.com/ with the MindCrack v7 modpack. PvP is enabled by default

Our admins have a background in information technology and are working on our own plugins/continued integration of Bukkit plugins into Forge.

Currently there are 3 possible ranks on the server:

1. default(you start in this group)
2. user(after 1d of playtime)
3. advanced(after 4d of playtime)
4. trusted(after 16d of playtime)

Higher ranks allow you to claim more and bigger residences(use /res limits to check).


How to claim your own area:

1. Get a wooden axe
2. Select a cuboid by left clicking on one end of your claim and right clicking on the other
3. use //expand vert
4. /region define regionname yourname
(where areaname is the name of your area)

This is if you want to allow your friends as well:

4. /region addmember regionname playername



* **Rules**: Since playing with other people is fun it should never be your goal to ruin someone else's experience. PvP is allowed outside of residences(those are regarded safe-zones!)

* **Description**:

TottonCraft is a whitelisted server all about the **vanilla experience**. No freebies or game changing mods allowed on here! We also like to make grinders and other high-tech redstone devices. Occasionally we have events in the weekends e.g. hardcore matches.

We provide a place for adults to do and build whatever they please (within reason of course :P)

Our main focus is to build a great community of members who help each other out as well as build wonderful towns and monuments together.

We have been online 24/7 since July 2011 and we aren't planning on closing up shop any time soon

Our detailed stats page tracks all of your actions in the server [\(example\)](http://www.tottoncraft.com/player-statistics/?player=S74Rshaped) and our [Live Map](http://map.tottoncraft.com/) shows you where you are at all times

As said
So


Be sure to check out the rest of the info on the site!

* **Description**: A simple vanilla server for adults, for everybody, always. The server is set to hard difficulty. PvP is turned off. No plugins! Some anti-cheat plugins might be added in the future, if we have any problems, but there will never be any plugins that affect game-play in anyway. I'm looking for people who are going to stick around, and build a nice tight-knit community.
    The map is randomly generated and fresh, please use the format below and message me, or post below. I'm looking for 15 or so people. Thank you!

* **Rules**: 
    Be nice. This is obvious. Nobody likes a jerk.
    No cheating. No mods/hacks/cheats whatever. No flying/x-hay or anything of the sort. Cheating results in a ban
    No stealing! Don't take anything without getting permission to do so.
    No griefing! Don't bother people's things. That's rude. Don't be rude.
    Be active! Anybody who doesn't log on for 2 weeks time will be unwhitelisted. (Unless they notify me of an absence.)

Coming back

So I decided to try and make my own. I have little experience in running a Minecraft server, or in group projects, I don't care. I have put in a whitelist to keep the douches out, and installed a handful of mods to keep the world safe and keep hackers out. Other than that and the essential commands, the world is vanilla.

If you love Minecraft, then hit me up with a PM. I'm going to make the server go live at 11:00 pm EST tonight, hopefully with a whitelist with a couple of people on it who can come and go as they please. If you guys would like to help me build spawn, that would be awesome as well, as I plan to make everything 100% legitimate without spawning materials (we'll see how that goes). :)

* PVP is ON
* Monsters are ON
* Difficulty is HARDCORE
* Deathban is 3 HOURS
* Map size is 10k by 10k

Once you're out of the spawn there is no going back and you will have to fight to survive. On death you are kicked out of the server and must wait 3 hours before you can come back. In terms of gameplay anything goes so be on your guard at all times. My only request is that you don't use exploits or hacked/modded clients to gain unfair advantage.

* The final one even had really odd ""extras"" added in that the admin didn't tell anyone about. Such as creepers that blow up into diamond ore blocks

(nearly). No whitelist but you must apply to build! PVP only in arenas and certain regions.

We have a core group of regular dedicated players and friendly moderators.

Anti-Grief Measures:
* Personal regions - you can't be griefed if your house is protected
* Rollback - Didn't setup a region?  That's ok
* Bans - We have near zero tolerance for griefing.

I plan for the server to be around for a long time but if you build something that you really like you can take it home with you. When updates call for terrain regeneration

We are a 100% no nonsense Minecraft server. Mostly vanilla except for anti-grief/cheat and some warps are set up to alleviate the longer walking distances. We are moderated 24/7 with highly manipulable rollbacks installed to ensure there won't be any long-lasting damage caused by griefing. Our moderation team won't hesitate to kick or ban at the slightest sign of bullshit or douchebaggery.

Server Specs:

* 16GB DDR3 RAM
* 3.2 GHz 6 core processor
* 64GB SSD
* 1TB Western Digital HDD

We are hosted at the [Nexcess](http://www.nexcess.net/) data center in Dearborn, we can support well over 120 players, but until Minecraft's multi-core support improves our max caps out well before that.

Here at NoBullcraft you start out as a [Drifter] and advance your way up to [Resident]. Residents are more respected, don't be a dick, and most importantly, don't ask to become one! New Residents are selected democratically by current residents, via a voting process held by one of our Mods or Admins.

Our server runs solely on donations, donators will receive a special custom tag of their choice, as well as super awesome protected plots of land...and we sure love donators &lt;3

Any further questions can be asked and answered either in-game

We look forward to seeing you online!

**MineGaiden - Now Serving 1.6.6**

After months of work and moving from host to host we're finally ready to open our server to the Minecraft community! Join us for when we kick off our PvP events in the next couple weeks and help get our (rather open-ended) economy rolling! The more people that become regular Miners

**Server Location:** New Jersey

**Address:** minegaiden.servegame.com

[Visit our forums!](http://www.minegaiden.forumotion.com)

[Our Subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/minegaiden)

*Mumble coming soon*

**Why MineGaiden?**
Our world is as open-ended as you want it to be. Our economy, or doesn't involve knocking out our transit system, it's open season!

**So wtf do I do now that I'm in here?**
All new players start in ""Peasantville, all-around good Miner and you'll be invited to join on of our growing cities. Start by building and gathering tools and weapons.. you'll never know when a Hit Squad might roll through Peasantville. [Click here](http://minegaiden.forumotion.com/t14-minegaiden-this-is-how-it-works) to read more about how we work.

**Open-ended economy?**
Yep, etc. etc. etc. We have Market zones in each city for you to post your [Trade] signs so there's always a central location for you to find the wares you need. We'll even pay you for helping us build up our infrastructure. 

**What kind of PvP events are you running?**
We have an arena setup with more on the way including a multichunk-sized ""world PvP"" section. PvP is always enabled outside of protection zones however

**Do you require donations?**
Never. I felt asking money for access to /kit and a couple cheesy commands was just that, and build rights on our Creative world. While this isn't a monthly requirement the more often you donate the more you secure your Lord status.

* Within a few hours someone will have burned every tree anywhere near spawn point
* If you find the 1x1 pointless pillars to the sky annoying
* The official minecraft server is very buggy.  Various things cause severe lag.  The server I'm running this on is a dual Xeon 2.33GHz machine and I gave the server 1G of memory.  It is connected to the Internet via 100Mbit Ethernet.  The server hardware and network connection are not overloaded... this is a problem in the software.  Tomorrow night when I shut down this test
* Running a completely open server is probably a bad idea unless you're a masochist.  Random people will come in and just fuck shit up.  This leads to a lot of complaining.

When you join the server for the first time you will spawn somewhere within a 5000 block radius. The spawns are random for everybody. There is no set spawn point. If you die you will respawn randomly unless you have created a bed.

The experiment is to see how fast people can find eachother and create a town. Here's the twist: you cant talk to other people unless you are 200 blocks away. So in order to be found you will need to create signs of your existance; statues

The only game changing plugins this server uses are LocalChat, grief, and make traps to kill others, as well as work together to build cities and monuments. Because of average minecraft server lag, I will not enable pvp. You will just need to find more creative ways to kill each other. There will be no spawning of any item in the server, not even by owner or admin. Everything in the server must be made.

My server was started in alpha, but also making it as similar to single player as possible. We've always been a small server, 20 or so slots, and people come and go, but we've always had regulars who were on all the time and who we trusted completely.

So, I was initially against it, but decided to let him try it. About a week it, we gained a whole bunch of new players, all interested in tekkit, while our older players and regulars decided they didn't like it, and wanted the old server and map back. I jumped on board with them, and thus a civil war ensued. The aftermath was that our server stayed tekkit, and started playing on capture the flag and Hunger Games servers, and we immediately gained back some of our older players

Now, and the tekkit elite spend all day bothering me to change to tekkit, which is as far from what I want as possible. 

So, and check out my server? If you don't like it, then you can go. But I want life to return to my server, it's a fantastic world full of incredible work by myself and our players,  and the remaining 3-4 people are extremely nice. We cater to all players, old school alpha and indef/indev guys, all the way to late beta and minecraft 1.0 players.

The goal is to rise from just getting out of jail, and of course weaponry to protect yourself from other blood-thirsty drug dealers looking for a quick buck. You can start out by growing some ""reed"" (Sugarcane) to sell illegally. DON'T let the cops (admins) see you with it, though. We also have the Weed plugin installed so if you throw ""reed"" in a fire, you go under the effects of that psychedelic drug. Now, once you make a living selling reed you can move to bigger and better things. Buy a brewing stand and start making the big bucks on potions. Lastly, when you tire of toiling over a brewing stand, you can start producing golden apples for immense profit.

The map has cool hidden passageways to explore, and some funny hippie shelters.

1332337657.0,r6ppm,Hey Reddit; I'm looking for volunteers :3,hatduck,10,4,17,"Ohai Redditors. Let me first say that I humbly apologize if this is frowned upon here

I've been working on a server concept for a little while with a few people. The basic idea is that there are four factions, as you may or may not know, is the developer behind iConomy and Permissions (shameless namedrop; ACTIVATE!). Together, he and the rest of my team are going to be building an RPG-style server that focuses on quality gameplay and teamwork.

What I am looking for Redditors, we're in early development, so we're working on a lot of stuff I'm really not ready to talk about (which seems like a tease, I know), but we're looking for a few of everything.

I need extra programmers who can write clean and well documented code. You will be working with Nijikokun to create a gameplay experience that feels true to the idea of a minecraft RPG. There will be no cheesy ""use eggs to cast spells"" sort of work here. Everything will integrate into the game seamlessly.

I need a one or two people who are very knowledgeable about game design, and that gives a real feel of progression and investment in a character.

Lastly, or generally gross-looking (I'm looking at you diamond blocks). You'll be handling the world as a whole, shaping it to look fantastic but realistic, so that we can do what terrain generators cannot, usually working together on one or two large projects at a time.

Normally I'd buy you a drink or two before trying to get into your pants my dear Redditors, just send me a PM. I'm perfectly happy to answer any amount of PM's to satisfy everyone's curiosity. You know, if there is any.

Finally, and maybe we can have a nice sit-down candlelight dinner or something. And maybe we can make out or something afterwards. Who knows?

Edit: I feel like I should mention somewhere in here that we have a very international team, so they we can have people functioning at all hours of the day. 

Edit #2: Thanks for all the responses! People seem to like PM a lot more than reply,,False,self,t5_2s3kg,True,,True

Server Address: game.8bitrift.com

Server Forums: [http://www.8bitrift.com](http://www.8bitrift.com)

If you're looking for the real Minecraft multiplayer experience, *what* I could build, and what blocks I could use, so I created my own.  



**Explore as far as you want!** Some of our players have traveled out to 200k blocks from spawn

**Use ALL the blocks!** Fire

**Kill ALL the mobs!** All passive and hostile mobs

**Always the newest version!** Never have to wait weeks after a new version comes out waiting for Bukkit devs to play catch-up.

**Limited op moderation** Our rules are designed to let you do what you want without being hassled by overbearing ops trying to use you as a play toy.

**Persistent World** The world was reset for the 1.0 release but we will never again reset the entire world. The marks you leave on this server will still be here one year from now. The only exception to this is that a small radius around spawn may be periodically reset if Mojang introduces radical changes to the world generator (such as new biomes).  


This is **not a chaos server**
No griefing, No cheating/hacking, No flying,  No douchebaggery, No justinbiebery.

Because there are no plugins to help thwart griefing there is a high chance that anything built near spawn will eventually become griefed. Our players are encouraged to explore out into the world and build as far from spawn as they are comfortable with. The minimum recommended distance is 3k

Technically we are an 18+ server - and age is determined by attitude.  Act like a child and you will be treated like one.  There is always staff online willing to help and you should be greeted with open arms.

Lastly, we would love to have you.

MCNSA.com is the IP - that's all you have to type.  We hope you join our family!

Cheers!

So far this server has stayed small so there still LOADS of space to build stuff. There is free land literally 30 seconds away from the spawn in any direction. Yet there is still a lot of cool stuff around the world that has been built up, we have players from Holland, Japan, and Australia who do not have issues with lag. We currently have around 8 regulars across different timezones, and many more frequent visiters. 

We just set up a new spawn in 1.0 land

**Who We Are Looking For:** At this point we have a good base of all sorts of players, or mature regulars.**  
Do you enjoy collecting all your materials on your own, and love to make amazing structures that are functional and aesthetically pleasing? **If yes, then this is the right place for you, and you will be extremely welcome on our server!** This is a whitelisted server, so in order to join, you must first apply!

**HOW TO APPLY:** If you **want the address to access** our server
**In the message to me**, what you will bring to our server, what country/timezone you are in, or any other additional info that you might want us to know for example some people like to send us albums of the builds they've made in the past. **If you don't Follow the instructions your application may be ignored.**

We even have an active [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/crabdancemc/) dedicated to everything related to our server, adventures, or other shenanigans. Our players our encouraged to post here and share ideas, which has turned out great for our community!


**Some basic info: This is a...**

* We run bukkit.

* Survival server, mine, venture the nether, explore. Its up to you.

* We try to keep the server as Vanilla as possible. The experience you can expect is the same mechanics as singleplayer

* No mods. we do use a few plugins tho

* Nothing that gives you an unfair advantage over other players is allowed. for example flying, using your own mods etc.

* No item Spawning. This is a vanilla server

* Fire and TNT is enabled

* Pvp is turned on

* Neutral/enemy mobs do spawn.

* You do not need permissions to build places. However

* We have two Spawns. The original is in pre 1.7 generated land

Buildworx is a server that provides a fun and ultimately friendly environment that supports creativity and survival. You're welcome to build however you want to and play the game in your own way. Do you prefer mining to making houses? That's fine

**What do I do first?**

Your first course of action is to check our rules and then head out into the wilderness! Craft your tools and once you find a suitable plot, admin or owner has approved this you'll be promoted to *Builder*, which gives you access to a few kits and more commands.

There are many different ranks you can achieve

**Builder
Resident 
Citizen** 

Are the main ranks.

Then you can maybe go on to be **Citizen+** or **Steward**

There's much more information on the forums and people on the server are willing to help at all times! There's usually people on at all hours as there are people from all over the world on the server.

**PvP**

Player vs Player IS on

If you believe somebody is harassing you for no reason then there is a place on the forums to report this.

**I've been griefed!**

Don't fret! We have a lot of anti griefing plugins so anything that has been griefed will not go unpunished as long as you report it within the first few days of griefing

**Are there perks for donating?**

Yes. Donating gives you a lot of extra perks as donations are what keeps the server afloat! However, basically.

**What can I do?**

Well, go ahead! It's completely up to you. 

**Please note

Backstory &amp; Plans: A few months ago some real life friends and myself decided to start this strictly vanilla  server. We've been around for 6 months now, and are still playing on a relatively fresh map (Though the beginning island is becoming a little more crowded). We will continue playing on this map for the rest of Minecraft beta, but once the official release hits, we will most likely start fresh one last time. When 1.9 comes out, we'll have a single portal to new 1.9 content for everyone as well. For now, we are just looking to invite some new players, to get to know, veteran players

-

Anywho,** and there are no players who are higher 'ranks' than anyone else. No one can just pay their way to admin. We definitely keep the original feel for a vanilla style of play, and the only plugins we use are of protection purposes. This includes being able to set private regions of any player to protect it from any possible griefing, creeper/enderman protection, Lockette, ect.


We even have the /home and /spawn commands *disabled* on our server. We have had a few people complain about this, out of any situation, can really take away from the survival experience. So you'll really have to be careful not to get lost :)


As far as Admins go

-

This is also a PvP-Enabled server, and your only purpose is to be a nuisance, this is not the server for you. But, PvP is in no way regulated, so feel free to take a kill if you find it necessary, or even if you're just bored, though if it ever becomes a major problem

That being said, but if you upset someone for any reason, or you're killed by another player for any reason, there isn't any guarantee you'll receive the items you lost. **Admins will not spawn any items for players on the server.**

-

For the time being, but as of yet, we've hardly had any problems with them. 

-

We have a number of players who frequent our server, so we are by no means a huge server. We are mostly just friends who hang out and play minecraft. We also host a **Ventrilo** server as well for anyone who is playing, and you can find the vent info in the /rules once you hop in game.

-

Other miscellaneous facts:

* We play on 'Normal mode' (Starvation drains you to half a heart)

* 30 slot server

* No white-list; we keep it disabled so there are no issues when anyone wants to invite their friends. 

-

That is all I can think of to put here for now, or send me a PM, and I'll shoot you a message with the server info. See you guys around!


**TL;DR**

* Strictly Vanilla SMP

* Minimal plugins; only used for protective reasons

* Been around 6 months; fresh map with 1.8

* 8-10 players online at peak times

* No player ranks; everyone is equal

* PvP-Enabled server

* If you die and lose your items

* No age requirement rules to play; just don't act retarded

* Ventrilo server also available for us

We recently had a hiatus of sorts in anticipation for the 1.8 update and have spent months designing a totally unique PvP/RP world and class system from the ground up.

We will be launching soon when a recommended build of bukkit is released for 1.8.1 (or 1.8.2 as the case may be) but in the meantime we have been designing our Kingdom based PvP world diligently.

To be clear: the server is not up yet but we are looking for some more players to join us when we re-launch. We are looking for mature players who enjoy RP and PvP. We are an international server with players from all over the US and Europe with a great community and lots of interaction between staff and players.

You can track our progress on our [forums](http://midgardrealm.net/forum/?action=forum) and take a look at the world which we have custom built on our [dynamic map](http://mc.midgardrealm.net:8123/#) with ultra high res mode. We also have a teamspeak server @ *talk.midgardrealm.net* that is usually active with the regulars

Our world is split into four Kingdoms (via the Towny plugin) that are governed by kings and a high council. Whilst we are primarily RP/PvP we do not make any demands of players to speak differently or act in RPMode

We also use the Heroes plugin for a class system with completely original and custom made Norse hero archetypes.

We have worked for 3 months now on this idea from design to implementation and so far it is looking great.

For example, [Norman Island](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=norman+island&amp;hl=en&amp;t=h&amp;z=14) is about 4km long and about 1km wide.  This means 4000 blocks long and 1000 blocks wide.  This is a pretty large island, in terms of Minecraft.  It would also be sculpted very similarly with the same basic elevations, etc.  If we go with Norman Island (based off Treasure Island, btw) we can also use Flanagan Island as a sort of recluse island, where we can cast off griefers to based off a community vote.

The basic idea should be that we are starting our own island nation, so we're all in it together, and they point isn't to build giant marios but to create a island nation, with a city hall, expansive farms, an airfield, etc.  We can import the same ship from the mine craft republic and park it in the harbor.

My server is a bit different and here and there I see the odd player very interested in our style. My first post relating to this server can be seen here:

http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/hwycy/lets_create_civilization_law_and_an_empire_from/

And it is basically under the same premise. The server developed _very well_ and the community grew quite nicely. 


http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/i1sip/started_an_anarchy_server_after_4_days_unexpected/


And with some recent server changes I've decided to open the server  up for white-listing again!

The premise of my server as seen in the first link is very simple

Currently we're in the center of a very grassy biome


tl;dr
- Light anarchy/RP.
- Minimal admin enforced rules.
- BorderGuard setup until 1.8 so we can keep what we build and expand with new terrain generated features in the future.


You can sign up at BinaryChaos.net in the whitelist forum!

**Overview:**

Greysoul is a community of active Minecrafters who have ascended into a world of battle and intrigue. The player base frequently participates in daily raids, chaotic brotherhood of Viking warriors, and shrewd Merchants. With the recent update to the Factions plug-in, it is now a better time than ever to join in this world as the Empires begin to expand outward from their home territories to uncontested lands. How will you forge your legend in this world of power and devastation? Come fight for glory, or build your name atop a mountain of gold. Earn your titles as you slay the enemy, strike down on the Tyrannical King and his legions, if you dare; or drive back the Viking hordes and wild beasts of lore untold. Whatever side you choose

**Server Perk:**

Every server you have been a part of has died off, giving feedback, getting adjustments, and/or developing ENTIRELY new plugins. The 'Arrow-Limiter' plugin was developed as a Greysoul exclusive plugin, then later released to improve other servers. The well known plugin, mcMMO, which was developed by Nossr50, are in constant communication on how to better mcMMO. What this means to you is our server is the breeding ground for new idea's and improvements of one of the best RPG - Leveling plugins

New plugins developed just for Greysoul are paid for by player donations to make this server better

***
##!NEW FEATURES!##
***

* Chaos PvP in the Nether
* 3 new Classes w/ quests! (Priest
* More Cities to choose as your home!
* Mudders Milk (Get drunk on Milk!)

**mcMMO

A RPG plugin that grants unique skills and a leveling experience to  players. Chose from one of many Professions and Weaponskills to upgrade and alter the way you fight in PVP Combat! Never before seen abilities to liven up the stale sword and bow spam!

***
##Classes and Skills##
***

* Swordsman
* Axeman
* Brawler
* Archer
* Mage (New Class!)
* Tamer (New Class!)
* Priest (New Class!)

Check out [this Imgur link](http://imgur.com/uf0mD?full) for a quick description of the Classes.

**New Classes!**

**Priest:** Love that feeling that YOU are the reason your teammates survived an ambush? That YOU and your buff on the swordsman are what caused a gank to go so well? Then look no further! The Priest could very well be the perfect class for you! Use your holy book to Heal

**Mage:** 'A 7 inch wicker wand is all I need to make my maidens love me' With the mage class, and blink away from the brunt of the damage! With lots of new spells being added constantly, this is becoming a very popular class! Get it while you can Harry!

**Tamer:** Harness the power of nature itself, and develop stronger bonds than glue itself. Fido will follow you into battle and loyally strike down any who have the audacity to oppose you. Unlike normal wolves, Fido will respawn after dying, with a short cooldown of course. Never feel lonely again, yet you are alone, so very, very alone...

***
##!NEW PLUGINS!##
***

**Arrow Limiter**

No more are the archers of this world, while the melee classes rejoice. Fear not archers, with slower speed comes higher damage. Each arrow at its base has been increased to 3 hearts. Increase this even more if you join Orsana and choose Archery as  your weapon skill.

**HookShot** (Donors Only)

See a need, then select string and right click, you will be yanked to the arrow. Use it to scale walls, Escape or chase down people in PVP. Go spelunking, shoot and zip anywhere your heart desires!

**Runecraft**

The Legendary SSP plugin ported over into SMP. Craft runes on the ground using Redstone, and voila. Useful and fun runes for the entire server to use. Examples being: Zeerix Chest, summon a chest to your location grab some items and then return that chest back to its orginal spot. Another? Well sure, Phantom Torch, a few simple redstone and a few torchs, creates a magic floating torch that follows you where ever you go, the duration is dependent on the Key Tier rune you use upon creation. These are just 2 examples of the many different runes you can cast!

**ItemCraft**

Itemcraft is a SMP port for SSP plugins. This AMAZING plugin allows SSP plugins like but not limited to, and Mo'Creatures to be ported over into SMP. Yes, thats right, I said Mo'Creatures on a SMP server. Before we get ahead of our selves I will explain the other 2 we have on our server.

* kSlopes: Allows for slanted blocks, giving your creations a totally unique, and unblocky feel to them.

* FancyPack: FancyPack adds many new items and designs to the game. Chairs, decorations, hidden wall panels, and much more!

* Mo'Creatures: One of the most famous SSP plugins that spawns lions and tigers and bears, rideable, and breedable horses (Horses are currently buggy in SMP)

* This is an SMP server

* Mods don't give out items.

* **Griefing is not tolerated** and we have several mods (as well as moderators) that keep this to a very minimum.  Even if a griefer comes in

* The server itself is hosted off of 16 gigs of ram, and all data is written to a SSD for maximum performance.

* Backsass to mods is tolerated as long as it is reasonable.  No noob towers

* We have mods in place to protect structures, doors, and dispensers.

* TNT and flint and steel are disabled for obvious reasons

Basically the rules are don't be a complete ass, but not at others expense.  We are a tight knit community but are very welcoming to new players.  So please check us out.

Since then, in addition to the old posting:

You'll start off in a somewhat deprecated spawn room. Still being rebuilt.

**Griefing information, nerfing both TNT and creepers. Additionally, I willingly will setup a protected zone for you to build your base on. I don't need to see a house built to set it up - you just need to pick a spot and ask to have it protected.

**User Commands and controls**: Type /help when you get in to see a list of most of the commands available to you. In addition, something I enabled just this morning: All players can currently use the /stack command. This autostacks (almost) every item you have that wouldnt normally stack. So, you can have stacks of food, stacks of doors, and so on.

**Additional Measures:** Fires will not spread on this server. Not from anything.

**Other points:**

* Server is currently only 8 slots max players. Don't worry
**Edit 2:** I just put in for another slot upgrade to 26 slots. We are going to run public with 20 slots here, this gives us more funds to increase the max. slots.

* Donations are now being accepted per request of various users. Donation information is near the bottom of this post.

**Our Server address is:** dk.no-ip.org

**Donation information**: Per user request, heres how it works. [Donation link](http://artofwarcentral.com/main.asp?page=donatefront&amp;d=222441) Go there, make an account with art of war and then you can donate. Please PM me here with the ID of your donation, and your minecraft user ID to confirm you have in fact donated. Any amount may be donated. Here are the (hopefully, balanced) rewards you will get for donating:

There is a non-game breaking donation shop in place. checkout the forums for details.

This should be balanced, as it were. Please discuss the idea here, and what you think of it. If its balanced or not in your opinion, and all that good stuff.

The first thing that will be done with donations is to increase the max. player slots.

**ALL** money goes directly to the server (I don't pocket a dime). You are donating directly to my server account with artofwar. We are not(?) using paypal in support of wikileaks.

If you like to create additions to our existing villages/creations you are more than welcome if you adhere to the ""theme"" of the place or if you feel like creating something totally different you can travel away and we will support you with warps to your new home!

Some noteable features we have

* Anti-Grief protections so that peasants (guests) can not harm your creations
* Nice starting area with alot of space for merchant shops this is our main trading hub.
* A public exchange of goods next to our bank!
* Secure Vaults made out of bedrock
* 5 areas are planned with fixed building locations (rp)
* A nice beach resort with beachbar where you can enjoy Cacti Mojitos
* Alcatraz Jail for really bad players! 
* A Football (Soccer) field - the pigs are winning at the moment
* A Basketball court
* We can create warp points to notable buildings and creations (if they are far away from the main hubs)
* We have a zeppelin traveling to Orgrimar and a LoL Pirate ship for happy moments!
* A not so big world tree and much more...

Our World Maps

The general idea would be for server owners and staff to report any major griefing attacks from users or to post server problems in order to more quickly resolve issues. That way a potential griefer can't just run through out entire list causing trouble on every server.

The Minecraft community is generally against widescale 'ban lists' as they count them as unfair

In the future, where one server 'hosts' an event or building competition each time.

Optionally we could also get together on Skype or Steam to provide instant updates on any major griefing that has been going on.

* **Game Type:**  Survival (Extra Hard)

~~--------------------------------------------------------------~~

* **Description:**  If Minecraft has gotten too easy and you want a challenge this is the place to be.  You're all but guaranteed to die here.  Server difficulty is massively ramped up from vanilla settings and there are several gameplay changes in effect.  Our goal is to provide an atmosphere where individuals can enjoy a strong and challenging PVE survival atmosphere while still being able to engage in PVP outside of the spawn city walls if they choose.  For those seeking a simpler life free of monsters &amp; PVP they have the option of working to become a citizen and building inside the city walls where these features are disabled.  They will however need to suffer with everyone else until Citizenship is earned.  Those choosing to live outside the city walls will continue to remain immune from PVP when standing within their claims.  There is however a cost to living far away - convenience.  There is only one warp on this server (/spawn) and it's on a lengthy cooldown.

**NOTE:  mcMMO has been tuned drastically down from default settings for balance.**

**NOTE:  There are no donation perks.  There are no donations at all.**

**NOTE:  There are no handouts or advantages given period.**

A few notable gameplay changes:

* 1)  Mobs are much more plentiful.
* 2)  A variety of additional blocks are impacted by gravity.
* 3)  Cave-ins are very real risk of mining.
* 4)  All mobs have new abilities and immunities.
* 5)  The deeper you dig the more dangerous it becomes.
* 6)  Crops have a chance of dying.
* 7)  Buckets can't move water source blocks.
* 8)  Pigmen are always hostile.
* 9)  Etc.

* **Rules:**  Have fun but be respectful.  Individuals found to be cheating (this includes X-ray), it's okay for people to get upset from time to time but don't go out of your way to be a dick.  Raiding unprotected chests is allowed.  Destruction of other people's builds just because you can however is not.  We've provided the tools necessary to protect yourselves and if people choose to not use them it's their responsibility.  Chain killing and spawn camping will also not be tolerated.

KittyCraft is a new Survival server

We are looking for mature players, etc.  If you can respect other players and type coherently, I don't care how old you are.

We have protection against griefing by the use of the GriefPrevention plugin.  When you place your first chest it will guide you on how to use it.

If you have any problems just contact the server admin or an online moderator.  Please don't ask to be a moderator.

Right now the server is set to allow 25 max players online at a time.  I'm not sure if this maximum is perfectly reflective of what the hardware can handle

We are open to suggestions on how to improve, feel free to leave a comment below, or direct your suggestion to the server admin, **KittyTristy**, in-game via the mail system.


* **Rules**

**-** Be respectful to other players.

**-** Please do not advertise other servers.

**-** Try to keep foul language to a minimum.

**-** Do not ask for creative mode, mod, admin, etc. If we need help, we'll come to you.

**-** Do not abuse any exploits you find on the server.  Report them immediately.

**- We have zero tolerance for cheating. Don't do it.**

**-** And most importantly

Hello, and you go level up by killing pvp, earn gold, buy land, loot others and earn titles. Gear is all bought through a gold system or found from killing NPCs and creatures with items on them. Then when you have geared up and have strengthened your kingdom, you can gather your friends together and invade another kingdom and raid them and kill their king. If their king is killed your kingdom can dominate the land and do with it what you want. There are Guards within each kingdom that protects the king which makes kingdom invasions a challenge. If you take the kingdom, the member of that kingdom can join another kingdom and re gear and re invade to re claim their land. Also there is an arena which holds grand PvP to all kingdoms where the king of the arena holds the title of (G.O.D God of death). Alliances and declarations of war among kingdoms are strongly encouraged.

* **Description**:

Did you purchase Minecraft for your young offspring or other relative? Get them whitelisted on The Sandlot so they have a safe place to play!

The Sandlot is a moderated, vulgarity, and the other various scourges of the internet. 

We accomplish this using a whitelist, as well as visible and present moderator staff.

We also have a solid group of friendly and helpful adult-age players that are parents, or just friendly strangers that enjoy the company of younger players.

Our server strives to maintain the ""vanilla"" experience, etc. We never spawn blocks, and our moderators and administrators play the game just like every other player.

We have been running for over a year now, and one hard difficulty. We recently started a new map (our normal difficulty map) so there is lots of room for players wanting a fresh start. 

* **Rules**: Our rules are simple and common sense yet clearly stated and are available on our website. No griefing, etc... We do strictly enforce our rules, and do not make them up as we go along.

**EDIT**: Server is now back up after grief fixing. White list is on, plus installed a patch that should stop some of the items overriding towny protections (but probably not all, so still be careful). PvP is still off and it is now a perma-banable offence to destroy Towny protected property using exploits in Tekkit. Thanks for the patience.

* **Server Address/IP**: 46.105.110.96:25592

* **Game Play Type**: Survival

***

* **Description**: This is a small community Tekkit server that is just starting out (you must use the Technic launcher to play). There is currently no whitelist, however PvP is on outside of towns. We use Towny and LWC to hep you protect your builds and valuables, with an economy system so players can earn money to start and expand towns. We also have chest shops that can be opened on Towny shop plots. In order to discourage PvP, stealing and griefing, there is a set of 'laws' separate from the server rules. Breaking of the law has in-game consequences. 
For example, but with Towny and LWC there should be no problems. Please act maturely and sensibly.

**EDIT:** Due to griefers using exploits in EE to break Towny protections

PvP has been turned off for now

There is also now a whitelist. If you wish to join

NOTE: There is also a bug that prevents the item Swiftwolf's Rending Gale form allowing flight sometimes

When you join

* **Rules**:
1. No client mods other than the Tekkit pack
2. No X-ray or see-through textures
3. No hacks or cheats to change game mode or get free items
4. No spamming chat
5. No asking for OP or Admin powers
6. No asking for free items

* **Laws**:
1. Do not kill fellow citizens (killing outlaws is ok)
2. Only post bounties on outlaws
3. No stealing from other citizens (unlocked chests in the wild are fair game)
4. Do not destroy other citizens' property

Have you ever wondered what it would be like re-enact Animal Crossing in minecraft?
I have!

Our wonderful team of admins have constructed a server from just their imagination and pure determination.
Just for you!

On Animal Crossing Wild Craft. You can own a house in a village and pay off your mortgage to earn the highest expansion!
The server is full of fun events which you will know from playing any Animal Crossing game!

In order to include PvP in this server we have made up certain events!
Including
- The bug-off
- The flea market
- The fishing tourney
- Christmas/Halloween Etc.
- Manhunt
- Team Vs Team
- Capture the flag
Each event has a big prize!

Not only can you pay off your mortgage to get a bigger house
Eg.
- Nooks shop upgrades
- Lighthouse
- Windmill
- Outdoor furniture
- Fountain
And due to the upcoming release of Animal Crossing 3DS all towns willl eventually undergo a couple of makeovers to relate more to the latest Animal Crossing game!

Vanilla PvP
---
Enjoy Player vs Player combat in its purest

* Smart Griefing - Hate players hiding in their houses to escape you? But also don't like your structures being griefed beyond recognition while you are offline? Then Smart Griefing is what you are after.
On Solus Gaming's Survival/PvP server you can break blocks to enter the house of a player

* No Chest Locking - Don't you just hate breaking into someone's house to find that their chests are 'locked by a magical spell'. Well you will never have that problem here. There is no form of chest locking by ANY player.

Additional Features
---
* Custom Terrain - The map at Solus Gaming's Survival/PvP was custom made with 23 unique biomes for you to explore and build on. A very nice change from default minecraft terrain generation.

* Non-Combat McMMO - McMMO provides extra things to do on a server but its combat skills are highly unbalanced and are just asking for people to 'bot' them. Enjoy PvP as it is intended but still gain progression for repetitive tasks such as land clearing and mining.

* Marketplace - You may buy and sell items via a user run global shop. Store some of your wealth in money so that you do not need to start from scratch if your chests are discovered.

* Donation Guarantee - At Solus Gaming's Survival/PvP server we pride ourselves in our fair donation rewards. You will never be able to buy item spawning

This… is Azurite 2.0.  

Actually

But you don’t care about that

Azurite 2.0 is a tech server. It’s got IndustrialCraft, we still have some cool features and giveaways that don’t require complicated techy doodads.  More on those later.

“So what?” says Mr. Generic Reader.  “There are plenty of tech servers out there.  You’re not special!”  
That really hurts

And it’s not just the science!  Scroll down a bit and peruse the “Screenshots” section of this post.  See those buildings?  Frank Lloyd Wright (read: famous architect dude) couldn’t have done any better!  And most of those were made before we even went public!  Just imagine the kind of stuff that we’ll be making (with your help) in the future!  Azurite 2.0 has everything you need to build.  It’s got dirt, and dirt, and wires, and dirt, and RedStone, and it even has dirt!  What more could you want?  

If that’s not enough, it shouldn’t take long.  

And now, and we’re fine with that.  But for those of you with some spare cash in your pockets, you can get access to some cool stuff, choose a custom title, or other things like that.  

What do we do with these donations?  Well, we want to be able to use the donations to fund prizes for raffles for our most active members.  We’ll also give a certain percentage of our donations to charity, which I must say is very generous of our admins.  Seriously, I have to say it.  They’re making me.  

* **Rules**: 

Rules and Guidelines

No Griefing. 

No arguing with authority.

Respect the Server and other players.

Use common sense and be civil.

Don't deliberately cause lag (redstone clocks etc).

Obey the spirit of the law.

The mods have wikis. Use them to get help

Any large scale projects (i.e. a subway system) you wish to work on 
you must present to a group of three admins

If you find a bug

No frame quarries.

Upgrade solar panels ASAP.

Rules with Machines

Do not keep timers running all the time when less than 10 seconds.

No Watermill systems.

No Flax Capacitors, or any other 
FTB type machines.

No construction foam. 

You must have at least 3 layers of protection before running a nuclear reactor.

Only one Forestry farm of each type per user.

Failure to follow any of these rules and guidelines can result from anything from loss of privileges to a perma-ban.  Punishments will be decided by the admin/mod.

The Sandlot is a small

We do not tolerate foul language, etc., and we work hard to teach younger players how to play civilly with each other. Most players are pleasantly surprised with how mature our playerbase can be despite their age (we have players as young as 5). Those that are needy, beggars, or generally annoying do not tend to stick around, because they don't get the negative attention that they want.

We recently started a new map with the release of 1.3. There is tons of open land available for the taking. Our moderator staff is very present, with nothing on our server spawned or gained illegitimately.

**The Craftsmen** love to mine and craft. Their interests lie in building magnificent constructions, they also find it necessary to hide their riches and create lookouts and traps in order to fend off The Barbarians.

This warrior race is primarily interested in combat. **The Barbarians** are at war with The Craftsmen

In the middle of all this we have **The citizens**, arranging deals between The Craftsmen and The Barbarians, as well filling as a darker role - swords for hire. Additionally, they operate as shrewd traders, supplying the two rival opponents with food and equipment…for a price.

A famous man once said, stole his items, and griefed his house. If that sounds like a good time to you or you enjoy the thrill of building a base on a server where your life and loot is in constant jeopardy, then Craft Chaos might be the right server for you. We have no rules. And when I say we have no rules I really mean that. Be as rude, crude, and cruel as you want, we prefer to let nature run it's course. Piss off enough people and eventually your uppance will come. Whether you hunt players, or earn your ore the old fashion way the choice is yours.

We believe leaving players to their own devices is the best way to run a server. But we enjoy adding the occasional optional opportunity at some PvP and loot through a bit of organized chaos. If your in game when a chest is about to drop you'll hear a call go out in chat. If your interested you've got 20 minutes to gear up and get down to the Arena before a chest of random goodies hits the floor and the melee ensues.",self,t5_2s3kg,1341370003.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcservers/comments/vzuc5/minecraftchaoscom_no_rules_survival_pvp_anarchy/

I'm currently running a really small home server following the ""Mindcrack doctrine"" and we're looking for a few decent folks to join.

The server is 1.2.5* private, no mods, no ops, no economy, no factions, no donations, no shops or any other bull like that. I run a few plugins like block logging, but nothing that affects gameplay. No players will have op or admin rights (there is a separate non-playing account just for admin work). 

The map is pretty much untouched still

The server is in the EU (GR) and currently home hosted so no guarantees for 24/7, and also have events like ultra hardcore highlander, hunger games, race for wool and so on.

Please comment with a few things about yourself, and we'll work from there.

Attackers may not enter the town or place TNT anywhere except in a cannon.

Defenders may not sabotage cannons but may fire back.

Defenders must search and take hold of a town and inform the server of where the town is. Once a town's population has been decimated

The server is creative so resources are unlimited and teamwork is crucial. PM me if you want to join and I'll give everyone the IP once I decide enough people want to play.

The server is in offline mode so players with cracked clients may still join and play.

Also, then back up a little. Coming too close to the towns is unfair and unsportsmanlike. Cannons must include projectiles and the firing TNT. Do not create cubes of tnt and set those off or you will get a ban.


EDIT (JUNE 14)
Do:Spawn villagers. Build/augment to a town.

Don't: Build towns out of obsidian, as long as NPCs may still be killed or the cannon may still be rendered useless by blasts.

 We are a new server with 72 slots
 The server is mainly made for factions and PVP'ing
 We have a good variety of useful plugins installed as well as good customer coders on hand to make new plugins.



Vital Craft is a brand new server which is here to test your skills in the wilderness

Once you have made your factions and are on your way to complete dominance just remember that them sneeky not so dominant people can still access your chests if they find away into your house. So lock your doors

We have allowed chest access in factions as it provide another level of gameplay to the server as them who are not so rich as the others can still manage to steal from right under your noses. They cannot open doors or even break anything


* No combat logging (We have a plugin to stop this)
* No major abuse to staff
* No racism of any kind
* No hacked clients of any kind.
* No xray texture packs or clients.
* Dont spam chat as its annoying and will end up you being muted.
* Do not ask admins to spawn you stuff or set you to creative (This includes people trying to use 'Forceop on me
* No inside raiding (dont join a faction just to steal there stuff then leave)



WE WANT YOU! WE ARE LOOKING FOR BIG STRONG FACTIONS WHO THINK THEY CAN TAKE OVER THE SERVER AND COMPETE AGIANST THE OTHER FACTION...

If you are looking for the best Minecraft experience out there than PLAY.10HEARTS.COM is the server for you and this is why.   With our 100% uptime since we released the server and our automatic server restarts every two hours there is NO LAG and SMOOTH GAMEPLAY. 

This server was designed with every playing aspect in mind.  We have multiple plugins to allow players to play there way they want.  If you want to PVP and Raid bases then you can do that.  If you want to PVE and build cities then you can do that.  Our “BIG THREE” plugins include, and MCMMO along with multiple plugins to stop and rollback griefing and people cheating.

Our website has been designed to be extremely user friendly and has multiple functions to increase your out of game experience.  Our favorite is the “STATS PAGE” that shows not only overall server stats

Our 10 Hearts staff is friendly, we ask you make the /modreq at that location. 

We also have our own public mumble for the use of our 

**10 HEARTS IMPORTANT PLUGIN OVERVIEW**

* **FACTIONS** - is a plugin that allows you to create a Faction and claim land for that faction.  Once land is claimed it can only be edited by other members of that faction.  You can designate owners of specific land in your faction that is claimed so only that member can edit that land inside that faction.  If your faction is a “PEACEFUL FACTION” (PVE) they cannot attack or be attacked in their land and their land cannot be taken over or raided by another faction. However
If your faction is a regular faction or non-peaceful faction (PvP) is allowed anywhere except in “Safe-Zones” (which is spawn).   If their power dips below their amount of claimed land then there base can be taken over.

* **ICONOMY** – We allow iConomy on this server because we have a server market and allow users to create Chest Shops to individually sell their items while they are offline.  Also when users vote on the website www.10Hearts.com/vote they are rewarded in game currency.  You can vote for the servers daily to earn a reward every day.

* **MCMMO** – This is by far my favorite plugin on the server.  It is both awesome for PvE and PvP players. This plugin allows for an RPG-like experience to exist in the world of Minecraft complete with experience points, and much more.  It is truly an amazing and fun plugin.

* **EXPERIENCED MINER** - Gaining experience to enchant items is a b****.  This plugin allows you to gain experience from breaking any natural block in the game.  The reason I said natural is because you cannot place and destroy a block to gain experience.

* **LOGBLOCK**- We use this plugin for a few reasons.  Because griefing of PvP factions is allowed we do not do it to roll back griefers. We instead use it to track players to make sure they do not x-ray.  We also use a lot of other anti x-ray plugins as well.  When it comes to PvE towns getting griefed by non-faithful members we can remove all of their grief within the town as well.

* **COMBAT TAG** – Is my favorite PvP plugin of all time.  This eliminates ANYONE from logging during PvP.  You might ask how that is possible and I will tell you.  Once you have been attacked by another player you and that player are both “Tagged” for combat.  If one of those players decides they want to be a wuss and leave the server creates an NPC of that player with the players’ equipment and full inventory on them.  If the player is killed while offline

**This and many more plugins and people make our servers great.  You should come check us out at play.10Hearts.com and look at our website www.10Hearts.com**

What is factions you might ask?  It’s a guild/clan oriented battlegrounds with virtually no rules.  It’s about as survival based as you’re going to get.  Griefing isn’t even possible in this game mode, but that can become compromised if you die and lose power.  Your whole world can flip upside down in an instant, but don’t let that discourage you, as you can do the same to other people.  Stealth and discretion are two abilities that will really help you in this game.

We also have an incredible easy-going community filled with fun and friendly people from all over the world. There are always community projects and activities going on such as Livestreaming movie nights, and a Mumble server for hanging out and getting to know your fellow crafters! Everyone is encouraged to get involved with projects and improve the community. The open and honest Staff are always willing to listen to ideas, questions, problems and concerns.

Basic Craft is a mature

Although the server is PvE, or multiple mobs at once. 

On top of community events in the PvP arena, Temple Run, Parkour, Archery, and Spleef for everyone to play. If you do well enough, you'll be given a great prize and be inducted into Basic Craft's trophy room!

Our admins are currently making a NEW games room. The games listed above are still available to play

Admins also run server events occasionally and announce a week in advance. Past server events include battles against multiple wither to earn a wither star and battles against multiple ender dragons to earn a dragon egg. Currently

If you're into community-style building or like to have neighbors around you while you build

The wonderful admins at Basic Craft are currently upgrading our jobs center. The job center currently offers farming, or to buy in-game currency exclusives such as a lava furnace. Using the jobs center also increases your McMMO points! Join now and be apart of the job center's grand reopening!

Even if you don't want to participate in community events or you want to play a more vanilla game without using in-game currency, then that's just fine with us!

Best of all

 Here at Minecraft Junkie we just love Minecraft and playing it, you may build right off the bat and we have no builder rank.

 Also, so everyone can play the game and not worry about their builds and items. Also our staff are promoted to playing just like you, they do not spawn items and we keep the true vanilla feel.

 We are very centered around the idea of a community. We have many towns, and whole civilizations of people working together to survive in the world of Minecraft. Each community can do whatever they please. They can institute their own economy system, make their own community storage, create farms, have leaders, make jobs, literally anything. This is what makes Minecraft Junkie so great

A brand new custom plug-in was just introduced with the 1.6.2 update

Experience a massive 10K x 10K map created just for Miner Apocalypse with epic landscape features, craters, rivers, and mountains that extend above the clouds. Every block is put there to create an immersive and epic apocalypse experience.

*Some more information about Miner Apocalypse:*

• Tight knit

• Apocalyptic atmosphere – We have a local chat plugin that only allows players to communicate clearly within 100 blocks

• Griefing, that means there are no protected zones and of course, nowhere is safe. Arm yourself! There is little room for pushovers on Miner Apocalypse. Defend your possessions!

• Paid for by donations – Meaning that it is absolutely free

• Run by the community

• Close to vanilla

The spawn of our server is on an island centrally located on the map. Our spawn building is specifically built underneath a volcano. From there you can walk to the portal house which teleports you to either the Northern or Southern capital city. After that point you can explore the world or walk into the wilderness to start your own base.

We have a list of rules which you can access on our server by typing /rules. However the most important thing to know is that griefing of any safezones or warzones is strictly forbidden and will result in a perm ban.

* **Description**: CraftSiege was born when a group of players, hypocrisy, ignorance, and staff who insisted on using their position to promote their agenda, the three individuals consisiting of Grixer, Ikorolch, and RelentlessSoviet set off to accomplish this challenging task.
Their goal was quite simple. The goal was to create a server by players for players. Having experienced a variety of other servers, and policies to create an environment that is driven by you the player. Our philosophy is to maintain an extremely limited role in the player’s everyday lives on the server.
As a result we think we can establish an element second to none. Players on CraftSiege won’t be dictated by the staff on what they can and can’t do, to shape the events that go on our worlds themselves, and to create an experience that anyone can enjoy. Welcome to CraftSiege.

**Description**

 
Server Owner: Zekeprower

 
Server admins: Phaedrusmind


**We have added the Battle Arena Plug-in!!**

 
Our world has changed and we have been blessed with completely custom biomes. You may find yourself wandering through volcanoes, hell biomes and much, much more! There are bosses to battle, and loot to be found. There are hidden cities, magical places that will teach you spells. But don’t forget above all this, we are an MCMMO factions based server. The beauty that you find you must protect with your guilds power and wit. Also if you like to play blackjack, well guess what… we have that too!

 

 

We are a pvp based server using the mcmmo plugin and we play legit, one being 1v1 arena, and the other being a 8 person ffa that is a timed match, items spawn on the map and the player with the most kills at the end wins. Anyone who feels they are the best can challenge someone to a duel in any arena and even bet on their match. Our map is 7000 blocks in all directions from spawn. You can teleport to spawn for free but only once every 30 minutes, you may use warp signs to visit the cities but they cost money.  Spawn is safezoned and provides a few basic items at a server shop. You will spawn with 2 dollars so spend your money wisely. To earn money you can sell items from your hand. We have tried to balance our economy so that 1000 dollars is a lot of money. There are 2 other cities around the map which contain better gear, blocks, and food offered from server stores. The cities also offer great loot and boss fights in hidden areas. Don’t be a afraid to look for buttons on this map. There are many and most of them do something!

 
**Rules**:  There are 3 admins and a group of mods to help keep the server enjoyable and cheat free. Our mods are experienced players with no benefits, no cheating, no game mods other than optifine or mcpatcher, no chat spam, no begging. Basically use common sense. Different rule violations bring different punishments.We will ban anyone right away if we catch you xraying, or using any game mods which are not accepted. Our mods are experienced players and they have heard every story in the book, it is best to admit what you have done and hope for mercy (if applicable). All bans are final.
