We don't need a stake in your project to do our best. No one is in this business to rip anyone off or make loads of cash. It's always a labor of love, and not get a return. But you want to offload some of that risk onto your work force. This is sleazy. And, not cool.

For composers: It's absolutely great to get your information and music out to people. Frequently, I've posted several ""[M]usician LF Project"" posts, and had no results from them. I would get suggestions and comments, but no real work. However, I've gotten at least 5 solid projects to work on from paying attention to people who REQUEST composers. So rather than throw your hat in the ring with 20 other composers all at the same time, I would consider patiently waiting for opportunities to arise. 

**TL;DR - I've gotten NO work from posting a ""[M]usician Looking For Work"" thread

So in response to this, like myself, who are *always* looking for new projects to work on.

Something like a single thread for musicians or a list over on the sidebar would be great for people to include a name, as any game developer can reference that list to find people they're interested in.

Unfortunately I can't post any of the stuff I have written for games here that have not been released yet

[Dual Dimensions](http://weeklybeats.com/#/derris-kharlan/music/dual-dimensions) is a rejected WIP for the game Parallax. Electronic / atmospheric. 

[Dr. Mad Stage 1 (old remix)](http://rokkochan.bandcamp.com/track/dr-mad-stage-1-old-chipped-by-derris-kharlan) is an authorised remix of a Rokko Chan (megaman flash game) track. 
Chiptune / Dance / House

[Syrup Quest](http://weeklybeats.com/#/derris-kharlan/music/folder-quest) (renamed) is a track for a company's mascot to be used for various purposes. 
Chiptune / Orchestra

[The Organic Food Store](http://weeklybeats.com/#/derris-kharlan/music/the-organic-food-store) is Jazzy

[Lazy Morning
](http://weeklybeats.com/#/derris-kharlan/music/lazy-morning) is Funky / Disco

[Luminesce](http://soundcloud.com/derris-kharlan/luminesce) - I'm mostly known for my chip music work

[Shop](http://soundcloud.com/derris-kharlan/shop) - Final Fantasy Tactics style shop theme. I was going for a lighter fun feel and felt that a busier track is somewhat appropriate in a shop scenario (seeing as all you are usually doing is navigating lists)

[Underwater](http://soundcloud.com/derris-kharlan/underwater) - Theme for an underwater city / village or something. 

[Synthy](http://weeklybeats.com/#/derris-kharlan/music/synthy) is ethereal and synthy. Actually the track that I pitched to the Parallax guys to get the job. Very atmospheric.

[Boss](http://weeklybeats.com/#/derris-kharlan/music/boss) is a boss theme for a game. Piano/Strings/Drums

[Running Riot](http://weeklybeats.com/#/derris-kharlan/music/running-riot) is one of the tracks I made at the last TIGjam. It's ridiculous. Chiptune.

[Quack](http://weeklybeats.com/#/derris-kharlan/music/quack) Quack.

[Magnetised](http://weeklybeats.com/#/derris-kharlan/music/magnetised) is a track for the game at theyloveyou.net (with melody though) 80s/Synthy. Nominated for Best Audio at Freeplay 2012!

[Super Levolution](http://weeklybeats.com/#/derris-kharlan/music/super-levolution) is a fairly lulzy track for a game made in [Ludum Dare 24](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&amp;uid=16861). Chiptune/Drum &amp; Bass/Cats/Ukelele

1374450192.0,1is103,Very Unique MMORPG Seeking Various Positions for Eventual Kickstarter,chronowar,23,9,17,"My name is James ""Walsingham"" Weeks previously of Trion Worlds  I am the Creative Director on a new project.

I have worked on the Community Team and directly with the devs and producers on RIFT, as such, we have an inner knowledge as to the processes and workflow involved. We also have many contacts within gaming media.

We are seeking various folks to begin work on a new project destined for Kickstarter. We have a 20+ member team with members having worked for the likes of LucasArts, Origin, and more.

As no one else is doing an MMO of this nature (and to our knowledge ever has)

As we are definitely playing this one close to the vest, if designed well, will have a good amount of appeal.

We will be starting out small, basic functionality (such as the questing system, UI, etc.), animation, and assets. We hope to have one dungeon completed before the crowd funding begins.

The position will eventually be a paying one providing the Kickstarter is successful

We plan for the game to be as fan-driven as possible, that the premise for the game is very, very unique. If we build it, they will come.

We are currently in need of:

**A few Environment Artists** (with at least one proficient in city building)

**A few Animators** (primarily character and mob animations at this time)

**Character and Creature Designers**

**Scripting Wizards**

**Engineers and those knowledgeable about mmo networking and client-side operations**

**Lead Game Designer**

**Content Designers** (objects and non-operational vehicles

**UI Designer** (familiar with Scaleform or the Hero UI system)

**Particle Effects Specialist**

**Engine:**

We are currently looking at / working on Unity 3D and Hero Engine. At the moment we are heavily leaning towards Hero Engine

If we happen to find an engineer this early capable of the network engineering necessary to support an MMORPG of medium magnitude on Unity, or Scalify Badumna). Aside from that, it looks to be Hero Engine.

That being said, we will also need class and systems leads.

Our priority at the moment is a lead designer who can keep things on track, etc.

Before we can discuss the game with you, and so that we can send you an NDA. 

If I had to describe our goal for the aesthetics, World of Warcraft. We hope to really see what Hero Engine is capable of.

An example of a model we will be using can be found [by clicking here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJ0RpgSgkYc).

Being that this is a very indie project

If anyone would like to put their time into the project

I guarantee this is unlike **anything** you have worked on before.

Thanks!

**UPDATE**: We've brought a concept artist, and have been in contact a good number more. There is a chance the UI position may be filled, but don't hesitate to contact us.",,False,self,t5_2sg66,,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/1is103/very_unique_mmorpg_seeking_various_positions_for/

1371323838.0,1gew8j,[P]rogrammer w/ casual + arcade game experience looking for full-time or contract work (willing to relocate),scswift,13,1,0,"Hello


I started programming from an early age and I began my career as a C/C++ programmer at a hardware company making 3D game controllers.  I then took a position as a level designer and and 2D/3D artist while working on Duke Nukem 3D:Duke it out in DC and Blood: Cryptic Passage.  I then went on to work again as a level designer on System Shock 2.  

From there, and developing an application called Seamless Texture Generator which uses algorithms I invented to remove perspective, smooth out lighting across an image, and blend opposing edges while maintaining contrast.

After that, then developing a match-3 game similar to Zuma which was never published because the company was bought out by PopCap.

From there I attempted to start my own company, which was published on ArcadeTown, but was ultimately a bit of a flop because shooters don't sell.

I then went on to learn how to design circuits and program microcontrollers

And after that I went back into doing contract work

Now


I am willing to relocate if necessary.  I currently live in New Hampshire but wouldn't mind moving to the west coast.


Here are some videos of games I worked on:

Lego builder bots:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAVPmvPW5rA

Attack of the Alien Space Beetles:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3x2g59hxklE


Space Beetles uses a sprite system I wrote.  It's fairly sophisticated, scaling with the parent, fading with the parent, etc.  It also features a simple physics engine and an advanced animation system with several types of interpolation / easing, and a path following system that can handle thousands of waypoints using binary search.  This path system was used in Volcano Gods, the unpublished Zuma-like game I mentioned earlier to move 50 spheres along multiple paths.  The spheres also used the easing in the animation system to snap back together and bounce when matches were made.  

The best way to get a feel for the quality of my work is to try out space beetles.  The game itself is a simple shooter

http://www.shawnswift.com/asb/Attack.of.the.Alien.Space.Beetles-v1.1.exe


Enter the name ""Cheater!"" to enable cheat codes, and B and N to skip to the first or final boss levels.  

Note how each enemy bullet affects the ship differently.  Note how you can shoot the powerups to juggle them.  Note how the powerups always bounce when they spawn towards the center of the screen so that they don't simply fly off the screen making them impossible to collect, and all the stars are themselves individual sprites animating.  Also note that the collision box for the ship is much smaller than the ship appears, in order to make things feel more fair to the player.  Finally, note that the game runs in full screen, at your desktop resolution, so the end user need not pick the optimal resolution for their screen in the game.  The game will also add black bars to the top and bottom or sides if need be to keep the aspect ratio square.

The game would have a start menu with 2 options Instructions and Play. There is NO player actions at all. It's all animations that are triggered by events.

The first scene is just a lady in an office with a time machine and 3 podiums where 3 treasures would go.

http://i.imgur.com/qWaWkVk.png

The player simply mouse clicks on the time machine

http://i.imgur.com/fldKS8D.png

The player chooses any of them, then the scene changes.

http://i.imgur.com/cmp7aul.png

What it is is just simply a multiple choice trivia game where the player is literally standing in place for each question. There are three separate questions that are multiple choice. Using the dpad, a new question pops up.

At the end there is a treasure. The player walks into it and holds it above her head. No animation. Just a static image of her holding it. Afterwards

http://i.imgur.com/tc5tj9S.png

The player can then reclick on the time machine, a simple static image will appear which will be the final credit image. By hitting the ESC button it takes the player back to the main menu. THAT'S IT.

Let's get strait to the point - I make cool audio, it's pretty spiffy.  
  
Contact: liz@bombadeerstudios.com  
  
My name is Liz, and creature VO artist for a brand-spankin'-new audio company called Bombadeer Studios. It's so new, it's not actually finished yet - at least not the legal paperwork, which is what matters when it comes to advertising the website and such. But that all takes time, and I'd rather be spending that time helping YOU on your cool stuff.  
  
My prices are **super reasonable**, and I never use loops in my music. I create them, fresh and new, just for you. Hell, most of the time I record the raw materials myself.  
  
**Here's the sort of stuff I can do for you**:

[Smooth
PLUS!
Combat, VO recording, editing and processing(I'm in touch with a couple very talented VO artists!), and implementation with FMOD, Wwise, and whatever other various game engines.  
  
**What about the music?**  
Well, of course your game needs something [happy-go-lucky!](http://www.thelizardofodd.com/music/BigglesvilleMarket.mp3) Or maybe even a little [silly](http://www.thelizardofodd.com/music/ImaginaryFriends.mp3).

Or something more like this [dark and grooving](http://www.thelizardofodd.com/music/1616.mp3) . . . thing. I dunno, you tell me, and I'll rock it.

I have some basic experience with Unity (went through a book I purchased and the tutorials + made some simple games) and looking for some partners to work asynchronously with on a project (preferably very small).

Pretty much just though it would be neat to find some people I might get a long with to work on a project. I don't have any game ideas in mind

Ideal partners would be another programmer (who has a little bit of artistic skill) who has similar/more experience.

I'm also open to working with UDK.

I wasn't sure if this was the right subreddit to post an add like this. If there are better please advise and I'll repost.

An article I wrote that communicates my gameplay theory and values as an indie developer:

http://gamedev.tutsplus.com/articles/game-design-articles/cubes-vs-space-marines-making-a-great-game-in-your-basement/

To address the main question immediately

I'm not great at programming, I want someone discerning who wants to make a quality product and sees value in this idea.

Here's where I've sorta set up shop if you want to read more about the game and its currently envisioned design, but where we both have an idea of what's doable and fun as well.

http://www.gamesprout.com/ideas/51a50377782ab085a800004b/design_document

What the programmer would need to be  able to do:
Really expand on the dynamic nature and behaviors of the fish so adventuring in the depths of the ocean feels like a constant sandbox of discovery, basic action/rpg elements and other general things to make a giant open ocean playable. 

I actually see this project as incredibly doable, every decision made was made not  just because it would be cool, but because it would also be easy to do. The game is just a few relatively simple systems that build together to potentially create an incredibly deep and engrossing experience that could reach an incredibly wide user demographic...

I've tried collaborating here before and ended up burned really bad twice, ready to try to keep us both motivated and the other 2 guys just weren't cut out for this deal, don't know what else to say. If you're a committed programmer who can slam out fun games, we could really have a bad ass game on our hands in the near future...

That said

While I like to dream this game could one day ship and make money on it's own, talk about the design document or whatever that's cool too.

I've run a development team before. It's no walk in the park when you start at zero. If you don't have a consistent programmer (even one with little skill) or any other position, haven't most every entity started up not through starting finances, but because they wanted to make a dream real?

I'm hoping that by posting this, as well as getting the work -done-. A group where listening to player feedback -before- implementing changes isn't thrown out the window. High quality business practices? Anybody?

So here's me reaching out :) And no offense

The following two lists are what's generally expected of an applicant

Traits I'm looking for in a developer:

- a passion for game development and execution (dream
- low skill or none but willing to learn? No problem so long as you try; improving over time.
- ability to commit to a project and finish it

- Programmers (C++ or Java preferred)
- Artists (digital, 2D, textures)
- Audio (music
- Writers (lesser extent until later down the road)
_______________________________

- zero tolerance for discrimination 
- positive work environment (blunt is fine
- consistent communication
- have time to burn
- apply yourself
- communication through Skype preferred
- ability to read and use Google Docs
- Leaves of absence are fine if notice is given (except emergencies of course)

---Let it be clear---

I consider myself someone who works alongside a team, ask me questions, and for heaven's sake be a little objective before getting all evil or afraid or defensive. Learn me. Then judge. 

**Where I've been in Game Dev** ( The story

This all started for me when I was leading a support group for Legend of Dragoon, the group lost momentum after awhile and some of them wanted to stay and try Game Design. Nobody knew what to do and we were certainly not ducks in a row. Largely because nobody else offered, I gave leadership a go. I didn't ""dev"" in a dedicated way until round two in 2012.

The game development scene started for me, but we didn't realize that Abysmal had such a negative connotation at the time. Starting in mid-2008 I in fact did not do much for asset development - mostly just leadership. Being honest, my only ""applied"" work is in Ast-Ore-Oids, a game being created by my longstanding friend Tyler and I. From 2008 till 2010 our single programmer and crew made four unfinished games, unable to stick to one thing. We first produced [Space Vigilantes](http://i49.tinypic.com/t5625f.png), basically a raw ""Space Invaders"" type of game. After getting enemy HP and player bullets done, the programmer got discouraged and wanted to work on something new. We made a game he called Mines, and we got levels and scaling music tracks that sounded more heavy as you leveled up. We hit a roadblock where we had a big white screen that hurt people's eyes

Sure enough the programmer switched again, and depending on how high you click-dragged them into the air, they took fall damage and/or died. We had a working mud-pool that slowed enemy units, and the castle took damage when the enemies got close. We also had a very rough attacking animation, even if the graphics were poor. And while it didn't match, he added a missile powerup that had a 5-or-10 second cooldown that destroyed all enemies that it landed near. 

However, directly, but it's in the past. Later, since the files weren't batched, a fellow team member and I re-textured Space Vigilantes and our [castle defense game](http://i46.tinypic.com/1128r9j.png), even if both games couldn't be completed (we never got the source code). At least it looked great in comparison to the old grass/sky/etc. This was around 2010. 

At this point we had a few dedicated people and no solid programming power, and he just didn't show up consistently. Great friend material, but not ideal for sticking to one thing. But it isn't -all- his fault, I'm not here to blame the programmer. I made the mistake of over-doing the leadership thing in 2008 and didn't learn until 2009 via an EVE Online experience.

For two years I was not involved in game development. In September 2012 this changed, my long-time friend Tyler was switching from PHP web programming into Java game dev. 

**Where my work starts**

So we started work in September. Tyler wanted to test his abilities by [recreating Block Runner](http://i48.tinypic.com/1264bq9.png) from scratch. By this time we realized there were several other games called Block Runner, while I focused on art. It was really tough as we still didn't have a theme at the time. Eventually we voted in favor of a Space theme, as square solid-color no-texture blocks on a white background still hurt the eyes, etc. At this point I developed [every art asset](http://i45.tinypic.com/166jbsz.png) except for the [title art](http://i48.tinypic.com/13zd9x3.png), which was done by a wonderful volunteer digital artist. 

We built it from the ground up since September 2012, but due to having a tough time in Blender I am having trouble with 3D modeling. I enjoy terrain editing and 3D modeling, but I only succeeded in those things in a game called Second Life which doesn't allow exporting. It's a virtual-avatar game, but I signed up for the building interface - still love it today, but I hope to learn Blender or something similar. I also liked Level Editing, where I spent months studying the -very- in-depth Unreal Tournament 2004's Unreal Ed 3. I went through so many hours of tutorials and I loved working through it; level design really spoke to me. I like the idea of taking that further, but I have not practiced in a long time. I know you guys want proof and I'm happy to give it

Going forward, level design, storyboarding, and concept art, but I would need to improve in most of these. I believe I'm most valuable right now as a texture artist and a concept artist/storyboard designer. My art was only supposed to be placeholder content in Ast-Ore-Oids but we have no other artists, so I've been re-designing and tweaking the art I made for AOO so it all feels like it's part of the same game. I'm it's main artist going forward, and I'm confident I'll do it justice. 

**You can play the alpha version** of Ast-Ore-Oids in PC or Mac at http://www.blockrunner.artistbeginnings.com for now. Tyler did all the programming, ask and advise.


**Leadership experience**

I've had a lot of amateur leadership experience over the last five years; although I don't claim to be a know-it-all or very well-seasoned compared to industry professionals. I like organization and I like making sure everybody's on the same page. I have lead my former game development team from 2008-2010, but I'm not in charge. I generally like to do all the ugly work that nobody else wants to do, such as alliance roster management (making sure people who leave the alliance no longer have access on the forums). I also administrate their voice chat server on Teamspeak, and I issue the bills to all alliance corporations every month that pay for our people's PVP fun and so on. Basically I'm the desk clerk, haha; I stopped playing the game for ""fun"" about two years ago. A lot of people just wanted to play the game and have fun, so when almost no-one offered to help manage these things, I stepped up knowing I'd keep it all in check.

So why? Why do all that? I'll tell you why. I often see entities that, or nobody steps up when the help is needed. I really dislike that, and I put myself in the equation -when welcomed-, knowing that I strive for making sure an entity stays healthy. A lot of teams fall apart because Person A doesn't care so long as he gets paid, and Person B is a huge slacker, and Person C is never around. I do leadership/management because I know I'll catch things like this, and politely notify people so we can get a replacement when somebody goes sour or simply has to leave for real-life stuff for awhile. As my superior says ""I keep the machine well-oiled and well-maintained."" I know management in itself is not as vital as the people providing art/audio/programming, but I'll be darned if I let a group I'm a part of die just because nobody wants to save the team when the ship is ready to get a hull breach and sink. So that's why I offer to lead - because I know I'll *take care* of something to the best of my ""amateur"" ability. It's not much in the real world

So that's a bit about me, just ask. I think I've lengthened this post long enough for right now. I've got a few GDDs to write.

Some of you may know me if you have been loitering around the chip music scene for the last few years - but as most of you won't I'll give a brief introduction.

My name is Nathan, and have played numerous shows/festivals around Australia and the United States. However, I write in a range of styles and can pretty much pick up a style/genre/aesthetic just by listening to it. Essentially what I can offer you is extremely high quality, interesting music, very short turnover, really reasonable rates (not free: my work has value), genuine enthusiasm and the ability to take your game's audio from mediocre to spectacular. Find a varied list of example tracks below. 

---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----

[Dual Dimensions](http://weeklybeats.com/#/derris-kharlan/music/dual-dimensions) is a rejected WIP for the game Parallax. Electronic / atmospheric. 

[Dr. Mad Stage 1 (old remix)](http://rokkochan.bandcamp.com/track/dr-mad-stage-1-old-chipped-by-derris-kharlan) was an requested remix of a Rokko Chan (megaman flash game) track. 
Chiptune / Dance / House

[Folder Quest](http://weeklybeats.com/#/derris-kharlan/music/folder-quest) is the title theme for one of the games I am working on. 
Chiptune / Orchestra

[The Organic Food Store](http://weeklybeats.com/#/derris-kharlan/music/the-organic-food-store) is Jazzy

[Lazy Morning
](http://weeklybeats.com/#/derris-kharlan/music/lazy-morning) is Funky / Disco

[Luminesce](http://soundcloud.com/derris-kharlan/luminesce) - I'm mostly known for my chip music work

[Shop](http://soundcloud.com/derris-kharlan/shop) - Final Fantasy Tactics style shop theme. I was going for a lighter fun feel and felt that a busier track is somewhat appropriate in a shop scenario (seeing as all you are usually doing is navigating lists)

[Underwater](http://soundcloud.com/derris-kharlan/underwater) - Theme for an underwater city / village or something. 

[Synthy](http://weeklybeats.com/#/derris-kharlan/music/synthy) is ethereal and synthy. Actually the track that I pitched to the Parallax guys to get the job. Very atmospheric.

[Opening](http://weeklybeats.com/#/derris-kharlan/music/opening) - this was made for one of my clients for the opening movie to their game. Medieval/Opening/Voiceover

[Sol](http://chiptuneswin.com/track/sol) - Was my track on the CHIPTUNES = WIN compilation that was recently released. 

---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----

I have SO MUCH MORE MUSIC. And a I obviously can't show most of the stuff for projects that are currently in progress... but if you have any requests of certain styles feel free to ask and I can either email you a track or post it here if I am allowed.

Here is the link: 

http://www.kradenscrypt.com/

Here's a quick game summary: 

You’ve been the last to be banished and sealed into the Kraden’s Crypt, where you control every hurl of your spell, every swing of your weapon or every pluck of your bow. Mix and match equipment and weapons to determine your class and play style. Fight Epic bosses, hordes of enemies and why not celebrate your victories in the tavern rooms with a few friendly crypt creatures? You may meet new characters that tell the story of the Crypt from many different perspectives. Never play the same game twice with our randomly generated Crypt that can catch you off guard through any given door!

We aim to make this game a unique physics orientated combat game, aim and control your attacks. We want you to feel the impact of an orc’s charging attack, and see the consequence of mistakes, thus making Kraden’s Crypt all the more rewarding when you prevail! We think the fundamental game-play with these mechanics combined with clever scenarios and coop game-play will offer plenty of challenge, replay value and endless possibilities for the future of the game.

Not only this we are story tellers at heart so we want these characters to feel alive, and of course there’s the mystery that is Kraden himself, who even some creatures of the Crypt are skeptical about.

We want the game to unfold through a randomly generated dungeon, and would like to see it come to life then help us by sharing it with friends and family, Spread the word!

Also We have no game programmer on the team yet, but we feel we have done a pretty good job portraying what we wan’t to aim for with our game,

If you would like to be a part of the team as a programmer or know someone who would then please get in touch and contact us at:

foster@wisewonky.com

Of course we wish this to be a commercial game and we will negotiate a fair cut for those who participate

My current interests are in RPG's, but then again, *I'm willing to do a lot of things.*

I also have a basic understanding of programming in java and C#

-Unpaid, but I won't be passing it off as just a ""hobby"". I'm dead serious about this, and so should the programmer. If it does end up selling for any reason, that's just a bonus.

-Also does game design. I don't want to make MY game or YOUR game but OUR game. I want a programmer with ideas as well

I also consider myself to be a down to earth and friendly guy who's easy to work with (at least I haven't yet been told otherwise!).


Feel free to have a listen to my demo reel over at [http://www.mattjavanshir.co.uk](http://www.mattjavanshir.co.uk) and if you like what you hear

My name is **Adam Haynes** and I am a music composer available to compose music for your game projects. I compose music for media in a variety of styles


* [Showreel - Audio Version - Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/adamhaynes/adam-haynes-composer-showreel)
 

* [Showreel - Video Version - YouTube](http://youtu.be/yau2O-eYOpQ)


The majority of my music is written in the way that **video game music** is: by capturing mood, whilst setting the scene and establishing an atmosphere. I'm particularly fond of writing music that is fun, quirky, and exaggerated, but I also compose music in a more subtle and emotional style too. I like to focus on themes (character or location) and strong melodies. 
I like to write in many styles, orchestral, instrumental, medieval, choral, piano, blues, electronic/synth, ""movie-esque"" styles


My biggest influence in my music is **Nobuo Uematsu** (*Final Fantasy*), and Joe Hisaishi (*Studio Ghibli*). Some metal works are also influential on me, such as Opeth's writing techniques, as well as classical composer Felix Mendelssohn.

Some of my original compositions can be heard in my Soundcloud sets:

* [Final Fantasy VIII Woodwind Sextet Arrangements](http://soundcloud.com/adamhaynes/sets/final-fantasy-viii-woodwind/)


I successfully achieved a BA in Music Composition for Professional Media in 2012, and arrange in many styles. Alongside my VGM composition styles, I am confident in my ability in writing music from different periods of Western classical and for multiple instruments of the orchestra. I also compose in styles from different cultures, such as Chinese folk, Argentine Tango.
I mostly compose digitally using VSTi.



I have had experience in working with music for animation (*The Bird Girl*), and have recently had my work showcased at [AlphaOmegaRadio.com](http://www.alphaomegaradio.com/) as a 'Featured Composer'.

My name is Jan Johansson

Early in my career I spent around **3 years developing racing car games** with online web leaderboard systems with administration tools. In short I worked on several different systems since the PC team was small so we all had a more fluid role which was good for me since it gave be a great start with a lot of insight.

Secondly I worked as a **programmer/project teacher and developer for around 1.5 years**

Currently I have just finished a break in all that is programming

Now we supply multiple services, but we are in the process to employ 2D/3D artists so we can supply a client with a total package. We also believe in keeping the client updated and integrated throughout the entire development process so all of us comes out of the **collaboration** happy.

or contact me at: jan@twoorb.com

Before this ends up being a wall of text I'll sum up my main skills as a programmer and individual:

* I have been working with almost all aspects of game programming / technical programming. Gameplay, Databases, 2D and 3D Graphics, Shaders, Animations, Tools, Audio, Build Systems.

* I use tools like Maya and Photoshop up to a intermediate level so even if I am “only” a programmer I still have knowledge in other fields that will help me communicate.

* I know the workflow of creating a game

* I have developed multiple rapid prototypes for a veteran game company and with great result.

* I am organized, helpful, driven, humorous, honest and from what I have heard, a bit stubborn ;) I like they city life as much as nature life (Fishing, hikes, etc)

Also we are **open to other kinds of payment**, etc. Tell us you situation and we will do our best to come up with a solution!

Hope to hear from you!

All the best

We're making an MMORPG, and to that end we need spriters.

Payment is... Well, microtransactions, advertising or what have you. If potential money doesn't exactly strike your fancy (totally understandable), we have current money that could be paid as well- Negotiable.

In summation, and the poor folks down below just get trodden on. However, this world is a bit different- For one thing, the colonization of this 'America'- the continent of Dabriehn- was delayed until much later. And, there's magic- Runic tattoos made with crystals found along the ley lines of the world that allow their user to gather power and cast spells.

For a simple way to describe this setting is 'dark dieselpunk magitech fantasy'- There are no elves here, giants- dominate the world. Below them are the natives of Dabriehn, the Demibeasts- Normal animals transformed into humanoid creatures by magical pollution. Satyrs, harpies, neireids (fishpeople), and wyverns all live in tribal groups on Dabreihn, though now they mostly live in slums. A [world map](http://i.imgur.com/zvfXY.jpg) has been done

Just so you know we actually do mean business here, 80+ pages at the moment) We have an artist for concept and design, several skilled programmers, and a reasonably large number of potential testers and players.

From you

First off, we're not picky). The character models and such would be from that isometric view as well. Gameplay would also be rather similar in its basics of turn-based strategy, although adjusted for playing a single character.

Second, probably not the movement.) Attack animations are very much appreciated and hoped for, but not required at the moment.

Lastly, what we're hoping for a base model + features kind of system. Separate sprites for clothing, equipped items (Probably just armor and such, not weapons or runes or anything), and hair, so that you don't have to actually draw each individual combination. They would also need the four-directions-movement sprites. Attack animations for them would be wonderful, but are not necessary at this point in time. Though adding them later would be a lot more of a nuisance... Spell effects and such are included in that 'not necessary but really really nice' category.

Monster design and visual stuff have people to take care of them- Our main issue is our difficulty in working with isometric sprites. That's what we need you for. There wouldn't be a deadline

Hi, server, web, mobile side, all that jazz, whatever is required. I've worked on MMO's, done AI, game systems

I have no artistic abilities and frankly I'm not a very good game designer either. So I'm looking for a creative partner. I'm not looking to make money or anything. I simply want to undertake a fun creative endeavor and try to build something that people may like. Something my son might like to play one day. I'm looking for a partner because frankly two heads are better than one

Right now I don't have any particular kinds of games in mind. I like innovative games, that would work because we might be able to do a strategy game or something. Pixel art, awesome. If you can only model, that might be okay, because we could do something with a flat/minimal/procedural look. Just please have more skills than merely having game ideas. I do need someone that can produce content.

I'm back! Many of you have seen me throw posts on here in a the last few months looking for coders and programmers for an RPG project I'm designing; well thanks to the thorough tutorials and the excellent community here, but unfortunately our timing hasn't lined up yet for a committed addition. 

Scope of work: Right now we are collecting area models (buildings, enemy models, and looking for a solid 2D artist for title screen/GUI/item &amp; ability icon work.

First

* Prototype is already in creation (many major systems working
* The entire game is laid out and ready for generation (with a focus on introductory areas currently)
* Currently the prototype is using mostly place holder art; this is a great opportunity for someone with some time on their hands to make an artistic mark in a big way!
* Extremely driven team that sets milestones &amp; goals (and then works to achieve them)
* Coded and developed in Unity for deployment on the PC &amp; Mac platform in C#
* Game-play and style reminiscent of Fallout 2 / Arcanum / Wasteland 2.

The current plan for this project:

* This project is marked Hobby due to the fact that we are not currently offering monetary compensation for the artwork.
* This project is also marked Revshare due to the fact that active and committed individuals will be asked on to the team when final development begins. *As a note
* The current timeline has us finishing the prototype (introductory area and prologue with all major systems in place) in Dec 2013. 


To put it bluntly; at this point we're looking for enthusiastic artists that want to work in an environment where progress is being made daily. This is the kind of project where you submit us models/art in the morning then download the latest update that evening to see your enemies/NPC/graphics in action. Again

More details on the project are available on request. We'll also give out the demo to anyone coming on board. 

If interested

Thanks as always

Grab a screen shot (either from the project's webpage) or download the game - play it and grab a screen shot (SHIFT H to hide the hud elements). Mock up the screen shot with your personal style/artistic ability/vision - in a semi rough state (eg: one item could be close to the finished style) rest could be placeholders very rough. Send that to me and we can go from there.",self,t5_2sg66,1356561438.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/15ftsb/lfartist_2d_for_a_hud_and_gui_overhaul_of_a_space/

The project is an arcade-style game where you are a kid in a neighborhood flinging water balloons at your neighbors who are wandering around. Your slingshot is at the bottom of the screen, and then released to fling balloons deep into the scene and hopefully hit a 2D character.

**EDIT**: Here is a [programmer-art screenshot](http://imgur.com/rFyUv) that shows the basic layout. Character art is completely temporary and for testing purposes only. I'm not looking to make a pixel-art game. The green boxes are to illustrate perspective.

The style of the game will be a cross of edgy and cute, and seeing him holler at you as he fades away. Obviously the art of these characters will be very important in establishing motivation and providing payoff.

A basic list of assets needed is:

* 7-10+ characters (kid, mom, business man, old man a few more interesting special characters), with about 4 very simple animations each (walking, ""dying"", etc). Characters will (with one exception) appear small onscreen so there isn't much room for detail
* Art for the slingshot
* 1 background scene: grass and sky.
* A few houses to scatter in the background.
* Other static objects such as bushes and shooting target (for practice mode)
* Simple menu assets that can be cut-up and reused to create the various menus
* Title Screen background (probably using hi-res versions of other assets)
* Miscellaneous UI art (badges
* Finally

There is also room for further creativity on your part, etc.

Obviously this is a *simple* game, etc. Some of the assets (like the Kid character, or the houses) will be color-shifted and reused.

1375018480.0,1j7q1z,Writing a politically charged story for an RPG-type game,shockfyre,7,1,9,"So like my title says

The story goes like this: 

It begins on December 10th

Aric, lending medical aid for refugees in Africa. He tends to be rather shy around women.

Ethan is an accomplished rhythm guitarist

Michael is a game design student

Crystal is doing a CNA program and is about to leave to start a job at a local hospital. She's in a relationship with her school work and likes keeping it that way.

Shane is a marketing and media student

As the days go by, calling themselves the Continentals, believe America to be corrupt and rather than sitting back and letting the world play itself out, they want to do something about it. On December 20th, numerous ""End of the World"" parties begin popping up, and Michael can't resist the promise of booze and drugs. Ethan eagerly attends one such party, along with Crystal. Shane is a strictly straight edge person

On the other side of the world, he offers her his iPod so he can go to sleep. As Led Zepplin rocks out, the first slice of the Continentals' attack begins - The plane is shot down, though Aric and two classmates only barely survive. A group of the Continentals arrive and take the three survivors captive. While being held, we get a glimpse of what the Continentals really want. In front of a video camera, one of the Continentals' camarilla begins to explain - They believe America has run its course, and corruption and lust has taken priority over the will of the people. They believe the poor are neglected since they can't financially contribute, they don't want money, he begins to execute the three surviving students. Slowly.

Later in the day on December 21st, Shane's fight or flight instinct kicks in and he steals the shooter's gun. He tells the guy ""I don't want to hurt you, but I will if I have to"". Shane then proceeds to shoot the man as he pulls a knife and tries to stab Shane...

...And ""Fall of the Union"" begins.

I feel like part of the reason I can't connect to most modern games is that it's all about shooting terrorists and having a prick waving contest between nations, as his life of living life inebriated and being cynical is suddenly uprooted when he needs to leave his life behind and learn to survive. The theme is the loss of innocence; we already get a glimpse of that as Shane, a very serious, business oriented fellow is forced to take a human life.

**tl;dr Four friends get caught up in a coup d'etat hatched by their own countrymen and must survive when their world goes to shit.**

1373328415.0,1hwfa3,[LF]Animator to for a 3d action mobile game! [paid],AveryTingWong,7,1,3,"EDIT: position filled! Thanks all!

Hi all

We're a small indie start up working on our first game as a company. Between the two of us we have nearly a two decades of game industry experience. We are self funded

Things you will do in the project will include:
-Setting up rigs and skinning about 4 characters to work with Unity.
-Cleaning up and fixing mocap data (we're using ipisoft mocap studio).
-Keyframed animations.
The game is a mobile (iOS/Android) 1v1 moba style game with a primary focus on PVP. You play as a ninja with ninjutsu powers (think Naruto) but it will be more about the different cool powers as opposed to hand to hand combat (there will be a little). The game has been described as a cross between Naruto and Magicka. You can check out our website with a bit of info about our game here (Jurojin): 

www.criticalbacongames.com

We will need between 30-40 animations (we have some walk cycles and some power animations done, ice sprays, lightning bolts, aoe's etc), walk cycle, sneak cycle (currently using procedural cycles from CAT, needs some tweaking). Animations for command inputs (hand symbols). Much can be reused for different powers.

The time frame is about 3 months with a large portion finished and working before PAX (2 months from now).

So, it's a mix of Metal Gear Solid and The Legend of Zelda, where the player must navigate through an environment to reach the end goal. They must avoid guards, and use the environment to their advantage to get through the world. One catch however, is that the character is blind! In a twist of fate, the character is blinded by magic, but the same magic has given them an extra ability, giving them a unique ability when looting the world and avoiding danger on their adventure.

1368785600.0,1eiczf,[LFA] Pixel Artist for indie studio logo / brand splash screen.,AirborneArie,7,0,15,"Hey there

**Who am I**

I'm Ariejan, my game is made up out of 8x8 pixel sprites. 

To get an idea

**The Task**

I'm looking for a logo for Forsaken Labs to use as a splash screen and for the website. The logo should be pixely (see stuff I like). I'm looking for a logo that includes ""Forsaken Labs""

The logo itself could show something of a laboratory setting (like a flask or something) but with a touch indicating the 'forsaken' part. Feel free to come up with fresh ideas here.

The logo should should be delivered as a standard PNG image that could be used a sprite directly with the sprites mentioned above (""Purge the alien menace"")

**Stuff I like**

To give you an impression of pixel art logo's I like:

By no means feel obliged to follow any style in these examples. It's here to give you an idea of what I'm looking for.

**The Reward**

I'm putting this request ""out there"" as a contest. Please submit your (watermarked

I'm a hobby/indie developer trying to put out my first game later this year.

The winning entry will be rewarded with a $75 Amazon Gift card. For the runner-up (if any) there's a $25 Amazon Gift card waiting.

1361398282.0,18wvi2,Would any programmers want  to collaborate on a tower defense game? (I'm an artist/ designer that dabbles in programming),crazyfingers619,8,3,4,"Here's my portfolio:
http://jeffberry.carbonmade.com/

Pitch: Tower defense games are relatively simple and offer tons of fun for relatively simple development both in programming and art

Plants vs. zombies for example was an incredibly successful game and I feel there's tons of room in this genre for more games of this type. The dream here is to make a game we're both wanting to work on and have ownership of while still making something that could end up being commercially viable.

I have some ideas of my own for where to take a tower defense game but i'm very open to coming up with an idea that we can both be excited about. I've been around this scene enough to know  how important it is to focus on your team's strengths and build the game around that

I'm looking for a competent programmer with shipped games able to follow through with a project and is a fan of the tower defense genre. There's plenty of fair weather designers out there

I have no doubt i could create quality 3d or 2d towers and landscapes and even enemies, but are actually more fun because of it. The zombies in plants vs. zombies were incredibly simple in their animation, but also very endearing and unique... Fun games don't have to be overly complex, but they do need to be deep in their simplicity.

What platform would we build this in? what engine? all that is up in the air

I know the odds of finding someone worth working with in these parts is rare

Oh and to supplement my art portfolio here's a 2 button (left and right mouse) Unity game I was working on solo that focused more on gameplay than art

http://www.2shared.com/file/9lNFPu9j/RamPageTest.html

Scene is RF5 under assets
(requires Unity)

And here's a starcraft 2 mod i made a while back that's easier to digest than a unity project (made all the art and gameplay tweaks myself):

The concept comes from my girlfriend while we were playing video games. She said to me ""Why don't they make a video game where you don't die"". Well

In the dead world you observe similar things to the real world, maybe you'll know if this game idea takes off.

We can release this game on donation or for a price, I want to be able to left click to find easter eggs, and I want to be able to move left/right/jump with A/D/SPACE.

TL;DR : I want to make a platform game where you play as a human that can either be alive or dead by the right click of a mouse,False,self,t5_2sg66,1360249937.0,,,t3_1813oh

I do have some money, but I have three things going for me that many don't:

   - I have already shipped many apps so I'm confident this one will ship

   - I have a partner on two of my previous apps and have been revenue splitting with him for a year now

   - I do have some up front cash

What's needed: 

   - [1] 3D model of a rabbit

   - [5] 3D models of other animals (the enemies)

   - a critical eye to the rest of the game

Our first game is 2D sprite based (we're using the 2D Toolkit, we're lacking in special effects and could greatly benefit from someone who really understands how to make stuff look ""cool"" in Unity3d. I'm trying to find someone available for contracting (and who could potentially join us as a partner if things work out) who:

* is a great artist and a decent coder
* is great at making special effects in 3D engines (with a focus on Mobile devices)
* has experience writing &amp; tweaking shaders
* has experience creating awesome particle effects
* (optional) has experience making 3D objects with animations (or at least can rig them so we can animate them later)
* (optional) knows the Unity3d art pipeline
* can use Git (source control)

Let me give you 2 examples of special effects that we would want someone to be able to do:

1) We have a bunch of flat 2d icons for a matching game. If you get a match

2) If you do something good in the game, a 3D animated object (like a treasure chest that coins and stuff fly out of), etc.

The challenge for me in doing these types of things is that I'm 95% programmer and 5% artist. In other words, I'm hoping to fill that gap with someone else, someone who has a good eye for art but is also technical.

Let me give you an idea on what I expect our workflow to be like. I'm going to be doing the majority of the game programming. I would basically make the game work

We would pay you an hourly rate (negotiable based on your experience) with the hopes that if things worked out you would want to join us full time. Then

I'm located in Berlin, video calls, and screen sharing for collaboration.

Interested parties should email me (taylor at foxcubgames.com) or post here. Include a link to your resume and/or portfolio. Then

Here is a screenshot of our current project: http://i.imgur.com/cMRE5.jpg

A little bit about me: My name is Ben, though I make progress on it nearly every day.

**2. Project Title**
The title of my project is Clash of Cards.

**3. Description of project**
I have been creating my game for about 11 months now from scratch in Java using LibGDX.  It currently is able to be deployed to PC (as a stand-alone app)
The project itself can be best described as a Card Based Adventure-RPG set in a somewhat classic medieval fantasy setting (mostly human, you obtain their ‘card’ (like a business card). The card battle is therefore explained as calling upon your honor-bound allies and friends to help you.  Cards will also be obtained through many avenues, in-world minigames, special events, or simply hidden throughout the world.  The art style is pixelart, and heavy inspiration has been taken from the classic Neo Geo Pocket game, Card Fighters (for the card art) and various RPGs for tile art

**4. Position &amp; Job Requirements**
At this stage of development, though I will certainly pass on my specs if requested.
As for the tilesets

*Forest Tileset:* The forest surrounding my capital city of Amn Isile is a thick deciduous forest.  Because Amn Isile is founded near the sea, overcast, that sort of thing. 

I have created a VERY rough tileset of grass/dirt/cliff which you can use as a reference here:
http://www.clashofcards.com/screenshot/ss2.png  
Some of the stuff I’ve seen from the RPG Maker community is also great. Here is a good example:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKFx9Qkkgvw&amp;feature=player_embedded

*City Tileset:* The other tileset I need is of the city of Amn Isile itself.  Some background about the area is that it’s the only place in this world where magic is allowed to be practiced. Sort of like a Las Vegas of magic.  The building tiles should be of a tudor style, and perhaps elements of magic (glowball street lamps? That sort of thing). I have not mocked up my own placeholder tileset for the city, so I will only have references from other art:
http://kiwinuptuo.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d4v6ro9
http://kiwinuptuo.deviantart.com/gallery/16300074?offset=24#/d2euwlo
http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/075/6/4/wizard_house_by_pinkfirefly-d3bsa4r.png
Though these aren't exactly in a city

Technical details:
Tiles should preferably be 32x32 px, such as trees, lights, etc do not have to be tiled(if you prefer), and can be any size/dimensions as they are essentially non-moving actors – I call them doodads.  Tiles and doodads can also be animated with any number of frames.

**5. Payment**
I have the utmost respect for game Artists, and I have no issue with this.  The caveat of course is that I’m not sure how long these tilesets would take to produce, though I realize quality takes time.
I’m not looking specifically for a rev-share or anything like that.  Perhaps part upfront

**6. Contact Information**
Please contact me at dashiva(at)dashiva.com.  If possible

I hope this wasn’t too long winded

The game aims to be quite gritty. Music will be dark ambient.

A human would be about 40px in height. I don't think there's need for views from all angles

Enemies will range from dark robed monks (or something) to high tech battle human/mech/monsters (think Quake1

The game (including all art) may be open sourced with a permissive license in the end

Fixed price for the whole project is about ~ $1200 (don't know if that's fair - you tell me)


**Update**

The number of animation sequences of course depends on the type of enemy.

So for instance a human type enemy will have an idle animation (think 2 frames, shooting and maybe a melee attack.
	
A simpler enemy type that behaves like the Fiend from Quake or Head Crabs from Half-Life will need an idle

The game's theme will be a kind of ascension. Going through Maya themed jungles, man-machine hybrids or battle-suits with somewhat like humans in them to fully automated turrets for the later levels.

I love the enemies from Quake1

What I don't want is enemies to look like normal humans with guns. There are enough COD games in this world already :)

When Intelligence became a commodity

Intelligence, forced to come to prominence when the Artificials took over the so-called ""defense"" satellites. Fire, tungsten rods, decrepit satellites in decaying orbits, even nuclear waste--the Arts used them all in their insane effort to drive humanity back into primitivism so they could take over our factories, laboratories, and remaining natural resources.

When brush fires are common

When the computers kill anything near books, signs of intelligence--the survivability of your species forces you to get stupid, fast, or go underground.

The sperm of a young, find a rabbit or other morsel of food, and live to share it with their idiot siblings.

The only exception to the rule of Dumb is the Factory where young women willingly submit to artificial or 
not-so-artificial insemination from the brain trusts of our era. They spread their legs for humanity in the dim hope that one day our best and brightest can emerge from the darkness and take back the surface from the Artificials.

I've been a lurker here a while

I'm a comic book writer and screenwriter (in that order ;) and I've always been interested in games as more than just a casual gamer. I have been writing professionally for 5 years now, have written dialogue for another film currently in production, and am working on dialogues on another screenplay at the moment (this is 'work for hire' and not the work I've done 'on spec' and am currently shopping around.)  

I am also one-half of the team behind 'Aaapki Poojita' a humor webcomic in Hindi and English

I would love to be involved in the development of a game with an experienced company since I am new to the medium, and with a good programmer would love to learn how to translate those to Game Mechanics.

* As I mentioned in the title, though Grim Fandango is my favourite among Lucasarts' catalogue, and Telltale games is fast becoming a close second.)

* I am looking to get into this professionally

So how about this - I will charge for 'game doctoring' i.e. if you have a basic idea for a game, write backstories, worldbuilding, or clear out plotholes if your game has any, or even if its a basic Plants vs Zombies type game, come up with an interesting twist to it - what ever you need, for a price.  

BUT, and we develop the idea together - we work out some sort of a revenue sharing or a deferred payment dealy.

You may be wondering why our game looks so bland. The fact of the matter is that our current team members need to focus on the coding and coding alone. We do not have the time
We are looking for someone willing/capable to take initiative on the graphics end.  
  
**Work ethic**
This game is large commitment on everyone’s end. We're trying to move as fast as we can given our limitations on free-time and our ineptitude to compensate anyone(including ourselves).  
The coders don't a have a lick of free-time as most of it either goes to school, or the development of this game. If we can expect the same from you, you'd be a good addition to the team.  
  
**Quality of work**  
We're not expecting top notch quality models from anyone. Only their full and undivided effort.  
We're willing to accommodate novices and intermediate level graphics people as long as they're reliable and produce better content than the coding team is capable of producing.  
We value work ethic
  
**Communication**  
We rely heavily on skype for communication and use it on a daily basis.

**Contact us**
Send a pm with you skype user ID
We're also using this to build a private profile for graphics artists we plan to reference whenever new projects come up.  
  
Tell us a bit about yourself and your current capabilities within the field of computer graphics/animation.
  
You can also post references to your portfolio/work in this thread so that it could be shown off to other people looking for Artists.
  
**Payment**  
Revshare /equity.

**Some things about me** (Skip down for project details)

I am a programmer. I work on games in my free time for fun. Most things I work on are just ideas me and some friends have bounced off each other. I have never actually completely finished a game, and so I try doing the artwork myself. It just kills the fun for me because it's extremely difficult.

My current project was something I came up with one night which I thought was pretty funny and have stuck with it because it sounds like a fun concept to me. None of my friends are very good artists

**About the project**

The game is currently a pixel style and my current character looks like Mario a little. It's only pixel at the moment because it was the easiest for me to animate. However, I'd totally be up for a style change.

I need pretty much everything art related done

* Characters &amp; animations for each state
    * Idle stances (left and right)
    * Walking states (left, down)
    * Attack/block/using of items
* Level art, that's what I'm aiming for.
* Items and weapons
* Some HUD and UI stuff
* And probably more

Like I said in my sorta half-assed bio, if any, money off the game. However, if while working on it, the game begins to look and feel really good, I may submit it to steam greenlight. If it were to be accepted there, we could talk about compensation for **all** work completed for the title.

If you are familiar with this Genre you may know that there are currently two games competing for top spot. Day Z &amp; War Z. You may also know that there is a lot of controversy surrounding these games and the limitations both of these games have.

Who Are We?
A group of individuals who have developed various types of games, SAMP)with a combined total of over 10,000 members. Over the past several years we have seen the interest this game genre has received, and received valuable information from our communities on what people are looking for. At the same time, we have developed a Multiplayer FPS prototype in Unity, several Mini-Games, and a browser based 3D chat game. All of this however, as well as personal experience and feedback given to us by thousands of players. I am currently getting a degree in Game Development and plan on developing the 3D Environments

What About The Game?
Unfortunately, and allow us to develop it fully. I am confident, that if we had the proper materials for our campaign, we could easily reach our fundraising goals. I can tell you, that it is a zombie-free Surival MMO set some time in the future. The environment will feature a post apocalyptic city. Though this information is somewhat vague, we will reveal more details to anyone interested in joining our team! 

What Do We Want? 
We've expended our own investment money (out of pocket) into other projects over the years. For this project, is some concept art for our Kickstarter Campaign. This will help us promote the campaign as well as help prospective players understand our ideas. If any artists would like to join us, we would very much appreciate it. Your work will be fully credited and you will be fully compensated once the project is funded. We are excited to get started, as there is great potential for our game to be hugely successful. You can be a part of it!

Concepts We May Require
An image of the futuristic city. A city block
Character concepts. Male &amp; Female Sci-Fi Appearance.
Modern/Futuristic House showing above/below ground structures.



What Else? 
We will be moving forward with the development of this game regardless of whether we find an artist to help us now or later. The only difference is going to be time. If we were to launch the campaign within the next few months, which is why we are asking for help from you guys.

I've broke ties with my last company for various reasons. The idea was that we'd make a MMORPG out of the Gauntlet style engine we wrote. I wanted to do episodic content, gaining resources in the process. Also another key feature would be that you'd recruit an army, and equip them with treasure. This would beat the problem most MMORPGS have of decking a single guy out with super uber rares, so rares no longer looked attractive. You should generally have someone to handme down some equipment.

Since it would be upgraded every 3-6 months, the game would be playable. But in a couple years, the game would be in full force.

If you want to test drive the engine

The difference between that game and the one we're making is all about depth of the RPG influencing the combat. I want to get to a state where you're having 500 against 500 army battles in full speed. Do you want to risk your own self and deal damage quicker

I have an overland already coded up, and rebuild a town. You can either feed the townspeople daily and instruct them to rebuild, or you can gather resources to help build it quicker. Anyway, the game is fun, and I spent a couple hundred extra hours on it from the last game, but my last company wouldn't even look at it because they didn't have time.

I know it is a shot in the dark, and many multi frame monsters. So I could understand why no one would want to help, it is significant work. But on the upside, you'll know the code is already done.

**More Info:**

I have been working on various projects since I was about 15 (that's nearly 12 years, what do they eat, and other things to ensure that I can capture the feel of the place the best I can. The goal of music in video games is to communicate to the audience what can't be done through text, dialogue, or gameplay. 

Style-wise I tend to focus on a mixture of electronic, and jazz. I am proficient with 8-bit music as well. I really enjoy working in ambient, noise, and other ""experimental"" genres.

When it comes to sound effects I create them using digital instruments, but sometimes that's not possible. 

I take my work seriously

**Education:**

* Bachelor's of Music - Five Towns College

* Associate's of Music - Bergen Community College

* Nearly 15 years of working with Digital Music.

**Tools:**

* ProTools 9.

* Fl Studio 9.

* Reason 4.

* Famitracker.

* Sibelius 6. 

**Other Skills:**

* Basic Programming knowledge. - I working on expanding my ability for audio development and would gladly take up a project that allows me to explore it. Currently I'm working on something in GameMaker

* Experience with QuArK and Hammer. - I'm no 3D level design master

* I make some mean Beef Stew and Chili. Doesn't help with audio skills

My name is Sottaceti, but I need a team to help me out. I have a lot of experience with writing; I've even written me own mum's papers for college and earned her perfect scores (least I could do for the lady for takin' care of my ass). I have a negligible amount of experience with 3D modeling, and I have a bit more extensive experience with music-making. I have no experience with programming at all. The majority of the creation of the game will be a co-operative endeavor.

I want to essentially utilize Amnesia: The Dark Descent's HPL1 engine, I would like the programmer to be able to tweak it should he wish. I want to build environments from scratch or using royalty-free and customized scenery and objects. I can assist in grunt work for 3D modeling if it is needed. I have FL Studio 9 along with NI Massive, Shreddage II, AmpliTube and Miroslav Philharmonik VSTs. I've made a variety of pieces utilizing those tools and, previously, Edirol Orchestral. I also have a partner who will be assisting us who is more dedicated to music production and has a better ear for composition and score than I do.

The game's story will be told through letters, and dialogue between two additional characters besides the main character. The story is built upon an extensive lore that has been in light development since 2009 intensive and intricate development since as early as mid-2012, so many portions of the story are set, however, the associates shall have a hefty final say in the inclusion of elements aside from those few predetermined.

The associates will be compensated as the project moves along as needed out of my own bank accounts. I have a minimum wage job lined up, and through digital downloads hosted by the associates' and my website for our act. I will take full responsibility in acquiring and funding voice talent where necessary.

Examples of talent will be mostly not directly related to the project at this point in time.

The system is very good. It uses graphs to create a reference map and then 'tile-izes' it with prefab 3d tiles. Its not actually that hard

There is *big money* to be made creating a system for this in C#/Unity and selling it on the Unity Asset Store, I know the maker of NGUI was grossing $300k/year on his $95 GUI system. Depending on the quality and amount of tiles, the system could be worth anywhere from $35-$200 per sale (bare bones tile set vs Path of Exile quality) and there is currently no solution available on the asset store for this to compete with. I think the business case speaks for itself. 

I'm looking for an artist to work with me in a joint venture to produce a working procedural system a la path of exile. The first person to publish a really great procedural system on the Unity asset store is going to make a lot of money and I hope its me and you :)

1357201451.0,15vojm,[LFA] [LFD] 2D Puzzle Platformer,D16_Nichevo,6,2,0,"**What is the game?**

Vox Venio is a 2D puzzle platformer with a slight twist. The player controls two characters -- one with the keyboard/gamepad as is the norm

You can read the game's development blog here:
http://deck16.net/tagged/vox-venio
There are plenty of images and videos if you scroll through.

**What roles are open?**

We are currently looking to fill two roles: an artist and a level designer.

The Artist:

The artist will be taking over from a previous artist who is no longer able to work on Vox Venio.

The new artist is not constrained by the old artist's design and may redesign the look of the game as he or she desires. Currently the game has a ""pixel art"" style, that the game is tile-based.

The Level Designer:

Level design in Vox Venio is quite easy and doesn't require skills beyond general computer literacy. Creativity and imagination matter most.

Both Roles:

Both positions are encouraged to take an active role in the ongoing design of the game. If you have good ideas we want to hear them!

Applicants should have easy access to a Windows computer (XP or later) so you can run the game. It does not have to be a particularly powerful machine

Applicants should be willing to communicate over IM or voice chat (it's so much easier to explain things that way).

If at all possible it would be nice to see your past work and/or any ideas you have regarding Vox Venio.

**What's in it for me?**

You should not be motivated by money. The game will only be sold (as opposed to made available freely) if it is good enough. And even if that happens there's no guarantee anyone will buy it. I repeat: you should not be motivated by money.

You will be joining a small and friendly team of hobbyists. Hopefully you'll have some fun!

1355868241.0,152nfk,[LFP &amp; A] Looking for some collaborators on a Fallout 2/Arcanum style project,BringingArcanumBack,6,2,4,"Hello!

About half a year ago I posted in /gamedev asking about how to get started with a few hundred pages of IP &amp; mechanics. Since that time

**What we're looking for currently:** Right now we're looking for a few good programmer and artists that want to work to bring this game to light. This game is primarily focused on the people who thoroughly enjoyed the freedom and exploration character possibilities in games such as Fallout I &amp; 2, this is not a paid position; I'm currently in school myself, and we have not yet made a push to publicly fund the project. All of this, however, will come later. We're looking for people who are passionate about bringing this type of experience back into the field, in a way that is interesting, innovate, immersive. 

**What we have:** Currently we have a working demo of the initial prologue location. The demo itself is about 25% complete

So why would you want to dedicate your free time to this project? Let's go over some of the features we'd like to eventually see in the game:

* Top down
* Point-&gt; Click driven interaction system
* Vertical-pane UI system (Left/Right panes) with Right/Left click choosing functionality (can extrapolate this further if necessary)
* Extensive experience system with bonuses for exploring 
* Unique Skill Group system (Characters are comprised of Skill Groups which house Ability Trees)
* Real and Turn based Combat system - This system is created
* Forward progressing storyline with five major Acts.
* Unique and magic world based in science and technology
* A long dead race of almost completely unknown origin that is just now being discovered
* Main story can be played by either side of the main conflict; Do you infiltrate as an honored brother or join the so called ""terrorists"" fighting for their freedom?
* 6 major continents (including the main city in the game). These continents all feature plotlines associated to the different tribes that originate. Map is created and ready to go
* A combination of old school roleplaying

Now, for platform flexibility, that we may keep it as such. *However, this is subject to change if required* as we will be willing to work with whatever talent is available. 

**Programmers**: We're looking for people who can work in a collaborative fashion with others, just shoot me a message with any questions.

**Artists**: Specifically we're looking for 3D modellers for the initial demo

For 3D Artists, would like to start working on our final product, but that is not reasonable in the current scope. 

**Our Current Scope:** What we're looking to do is create a ""foundation"" build for this project. We have a semi-lengthy Core Build Requirement document that we'd like to have completed before the world construction and integration begins. This includes:

* Character and NPC systems
* Point -&gt; Click interaction systems (Identification of move commands/object interaction/etc)
* Pathfinding and Locomotion system (Currently using A*
* Hex based tile integration
* Real and Turn based Combat transition and system P.O.C. (Already created

1355273520.0,14p3pz,[LFT]eam to work on a free-roam island survival game [Hobby],SoModest,9,4,14,"First timer here. I do game design and writing. I'm willing to work as hard as I need to in order to complete this game. I guess I should explain how this idea came to be then tell you what the game is about.


The game is kind of a mixture of the age old question, gave him a basic answer. I'd find shelter, forage for food, and purify water. But then I kept thinking about it. By the time I got home I had a million ideas in my head of what I would do, so here I am ready to put that into a game.


The game's main concept is surviving on an island. Other than that I can't get into details


anon599999@gmail.com


**EDIT: Details. The game will be a free-roaming text based RPG where your main goal is to survive on an island an find out why you were put on the island in the first place. The map of the game will kind of work like a grid. You might start out in maybe C12 and you want to move to another area which will be C13. When you move to the next area, fish, gather materials, and set up camp. Every event will have a response to it. There will be unique events, some pertaining to the main storyline and some independent ones.** There is a lot more to the game but I'd rather talk about it in voice-chat.


So far I have a list of game concepts, I may add/revise the introduction to give it more character/personality.


This game should be easy to code and create


What kind of team I'll need:

~~-Flash Developer (or something similar)~~

-Artist (2D)

~~-Writer/Game Design (For extra help)~~

~~-Music/Sound Composer~~


I may be missing something vital to the game's creation because my lack of knowledge of coding


If you want to be involved in other ways other than the making of the game itself. I may need a website down the line once the game is ready for release.

We are Mercenary Games, an upcoming tactical space combat title (due late December 2012), and also [a Kickstarter survivor.](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mercenary-games/vigrior-maneuver-warfare?ref=users)

**THE MISSION**

We've decided to freeze off our 2nd Kickstarter run

* Completing FleetCOMM (at ~80%) 
* We are looking for new crew members for our new mission starting Winter 2013.  

As described in the heading


**THE IDEAL RECRUIT**

*Anne Hathaway


**THE RECRUIT**

Someone who wants to have a project gearing for an intense combat atmosphere. Your role will be producing cohesive, we don't mean mindless violence, rather *mindful violence*. You also want to own the visual style of the game, and will be the principal artist if the project expands.

You must be comfortable working with a networked group with no physical office

*We don't care how many years of ""industry experience"" you have; if you show us a portfolio of your work

**YOUR SPECIALTY**

You must be hungry for a project with a mecha-dystopian scifi style, and drone armadas. 

**THE TOOLS &amp; ENGINE**

We have a custom built pipeline that values simplicity. Nothing as big as Unity

We use Skype

Our core engine modules can deploy in the following platforms

* Windows
* Linux
* Mac
* iOS
* Android


**THE TEAM COMPOSITION**

This next project will start off with a very small team; a maximum of three to four core members. We're keeping this operation small since the next game concept is still being drafted. With a smaller team

**PROJECT PHASES**

This is a long term project

**THE TIMELINE**

* JAN 2013 : crew members convene to create core game concepts.
* FEB 2013 : core engine modules drafted and ready for playtesting.
* MAR 2013 : playable multiplayer alpha engine
* SUMMER 2013 : multiplayer beta.

**THE LOOT**

This is a revenue sharing project, and no NDA. We don't need ""secrecy""; you can blog and talk about the project at your discretion. While keeping this core team small, we will also have a bigger share for each member. Crowdfunding potential is always on the table, depending on what we can accomplish and show as a playable game using 3 months of crafting time.

That said

Here is a small pitch of my project:

 * The character is a household pet going through the trials and tribulations of daily life. I want the game to be interesting, I'd like the game to feel as fluid as Super Meat Boy or Rayman: Origins (e.g. lots of very fluid jumping).

Responsibilities:

 * Front end client programming
 * Graphics rendering (though I'll provide/edit the artwork as we work on things).
 * Game logic development
 * Enjoy ourselves!

Requirements:

 * Passion and enough skill to hold your own
 * Previous experience in game development would be nice
 * I'd like the game to end up being cross-platform (Win/Mac/Linux

Compensation:

 * Compensation would only come at the end of the project assuming we decide to sell it. You'll hopefully learn to find that I'm quite the Good Guy Greg and will be fair and ethical in this domain. I can't stress this enough. Trust is hugely important in any team. I'll trust you

**The game**

Sequence is a skill-based game where the player has to complete as many sequences as he can, the more points the player earns, granting him the option to enter a special mode to boost their time and score count.

You can see a video [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hArqdmgnooo) (note that it's recorded on an emulator so the performance and colors are not entirely representative).

Some screenshots here:

When finished

We understand everybody likes being paid for their work, wants to be part of a polished project for fun, experience and expand (or start) his/her gamedev portfolio.

**Details**

At least two musical pieces are needed, one would be appreciated for the moments when the player gets to enter into a special mode.

We prefer the pieces to be in .ogg

Besides that

Super Avalanche is a retro jumping platformer that builds on the gameplay established by the first game. It is a randomized climbing game that features power-ups, bosses, multiple gameplay modes and local multiplayer.

Right now most of the major elements of the game are in place (several enemy types, climbing, etc). The only thing preventing alpha release are a lack of menus and music.

The final game will be released in two forms: a premium edition and a free edition.

About me: I’m a designer, and a general business guy. I can do just about anything for game dev, but while I have a rudimentary understanding of programming (some XNA and scripting work), it’s not really something I’m very good at. I’ve formed, led, and worked with many teams of people before successfully. My most recent project was a card game that I got published, revealed and sold at Gen Con, with agreed upon shares based on who’s doing what work. I am dedicated to my work and will do whatever we need to finish our game!

About the projects: Depending on what kind of result I get
LOCKS is a simple word game for two players. I’d like to release an iOS/Android (and maybe web) version. The project is incredibly simple to make which makes it a good way to gauge how we work together

The second project is Tannhauser Gate, with a very simple first-stage prototype that can be built on and iterated until the final project is finished.

For the past few months I have been prototyping and finally started work on a 2D platform game in Unity. I am a lone programmer/designer however I am less than useless when it comes to art.

I'm looking for someone who is able to contribute everything from environments/characters/sprite sheets to the project. I have a rough idea of what I want however the floor is open to experiement in whatever way you want. I'll try to contribute to the overall process however

Unfortunately

If anyone is interested

** EDIT ** Adding description of the game

The platformer that I am working on is a game called Tempus and its main mechanic is inspired by the time rewind mechanic of Braid. The key differences between this game and Braid however

The NPC's in the game perform various actions on the level, from the players view are all playing out simultaneously.

Lets say and NPC, and continues on. If you take that box to use in a puzzle solution, you are interrupting the timeline, and so the NPC ceases to exist. If you however rewind time until the point BEFORE you interacted with the box, the NPC exists again and the timeline is reinstated.

In a nutshell, but by performing the correct actions at the correct time. Since time is not explicitly linear, it is up to the player to manipulate time in order to find the correct place on the timeline to perform these actions.

If anyone has any questions

The game is a 2D side-scroller strategy game: you get to spawn some units (while minding your gold) and so does the computer and they battle it out until either of your castles are destroyed. Those action sequences are separated by a campaign style map where you manage your economy and defend or invade countries.
Other game mechanics include spells

The assets required would be:
# 5 units,die)
# 1 environment with a few layers to use for all that fancy parallax crap.
# 2 buildings: A castle and a tower.
# A map
# A few icons for spell and skills. I haven't counted but that's between 10 and 20.

I'm CK, I'd be happy to set that person to work on asset creation (and start paying him/her!) immediately.

Our first target platform is Windows if that's a thing you care about.

Said artist will be responsible for the entirety of the project's art, level backgrounds/environments, HUD/menu colorfulness, icons, etc.  You are not responsible for game mechanics/design, but your input is more than welcome.

About me: I've made a game and a half by myself previous to this project.  The full game is [SPACIOUS](http://www.desura.com/games/spacious), but most of my dev work for it ought to be done in a few months.)  I worked in other industries as a programmer for five years prior to making SPACIOUS.

I've raised funding for the project and would like to pay an artist outright for the work.  I'd be willing to make a revenue-share deal (or some hybrid) if for some reason the right person for the project would prefer it.  This is a full-time contract that will last at least six months. 

My target artist is someone with talent but not a tremendous amount of industry experience; I have funding

In terms of your personal style

Shadow Grip is a top-down puzzle game where you control a human character and his two shadows (red and blue) to solve puzzles.  

This game is the result of 1 semester of hard work from our small team at Indiana University.  However, I had to pick up art duties and tried my best to fill the role.  Now that the course is finished, we are looking for any artists who are passionate and looking 
to build their portfolio.


**What our goal is:**


Our goal for Shadow Grip is to make a great indie game that we can show off on our portfolios.  As such

Making money off the game in the future is a possibility, you can be rest assured you will be making money as well.  Our goal is to be as fair as possible because to be honest, we are just looking to make something we can be proud of.


**What we are looking for:**


We are looking for motivated 2D and 3D artists who are interested in building a portfolio and some experience.  Our goal is to make a game that stylishly meshes 2D and 3D aesthetics.

2D Artists - Our 2D art of the game is focused on characters and character animation.  This however can extend over into character effects if the artist has the desire.

3D Artists - Our 3D art is focused on the game environment.  These 3D environments are meant to eventually mesh well with the 2D art.  This is a good example of what we will be going for in regards to this

1367695517.0,1doxs9,Deep psychological thriller/horror project seeking help.,Lhino,4,0,2,"Hello everyone! There is quite a bit of information here

Yet as I explored various genres, an engrossing setting, excellent narrative and seemingly limitless gameplay possibilities. I have been writing for about nine years now and gaming for the past eight. I have written many stories before, but none have ever been published as I had no intention of doing so at the time. 

I have always dreamed of becoming an author as a hobby, allow me to introduce the project and give you all a better idea of what is expected and how I plan on handling this.

Concept

Working title: Ethereal

Here is a bit of the narrative from the beginning of the game. All work in progress.

The game begins with a line from the protagonist while the screen remains black, blocking out all hope of escape. These creatures do not utter a word, but their intentions are clear enough. I find myself standing upon a diving board, my eyes drawn into the abyss that lies before me. I can hear death's voice growing louder with every passing moment, but never does it extend the courtesy of calling my name. The glow from the rancid waters below offers little solace in such a cold and unforgiving place. A bubbling mess that has consumed so many before me. Their souls swell around in the green liquid, begging for forgiveness, cursing their misfortunes and crying out for loved ones that have been lost to them. All the while I continue to ask the same question over and over again; how did I get here? I barely remember anything of my life, no matter how small or insignificant they may seem. A final chance to reminisce about a past I cannot seem to recall. One cannot ask for anything more in my situation. I can think of few words with which to leave this strange world...but these will just have to suffice. Adieu and farewell.” The player is presented with a prompt to move forward, revealing stone walls all around him
Throughout the game there will be a very deep inner-narrative, but gameplay is a major part of it as well. It will be a first-person game. 

What makes it a psychological thriller/ horror game is the setting in which the story takes place. I do not want to give away the entire story here by detailing exactly what the place is or what brought the protagonist to it

There will not be a fixed gameplay style, but there will also be various other obstacles and enemies to overcome along the way. The game will be single-player only (for now). There will be a lot of different locations: caves, buildings (one in particular is about five-stories high) and even natural environments like forests.

Ultimately I plan for this game to be an incredibly deep and moving experience for the player. It will offer very interesting gameplay mechanics, it is open to discussion. Those two platforms will probably be Kickstarter stretch goals however as we can then hire experienced mobile game developers to assist us. 

Once a good team has been recruited

Right now (2013)

I can program pretty well and I have been learning Unity 4 for the past few months. I am already working with a number of different AI programming techniques

I am currently involved in another game-development project where I have learned A TON of important things, development will go into full swing. 

I plan to have a trailer out by about March- May 2014, youtube devblogs and other communication mediums. 

Now onto the topic of money (yay!). The Kickstarter will hopefully bring in a good amount of money that can be spread around between all of us. Some of that money though will NEED to go toward additional things to assist with the project (possibly additional licenses, the other 70% of profits will go to everyone that contributed to the project, calculated by how much each person put in. 

Positions:
If you have previous experience working on a game-title or have some sort of portfolio to present with your application, you should have some experience with Unity as well (Unless you fall under the role of concept artists or similar fields). You must have some people skills! We don't want any fights breaking out about silly things. English is the primary language of the team and therefore you must be able to speak and write in English fluently. We will definitely excuse some bad grammar or spelling if English is not your language of choice, so don't be afraid to apply. You must be willing to communicate with the team and be able to meet deadlines when the time arrives. Knowledge of DX11 implementation and programming is a MASSIVE plus! If you already have a professional version of Unity 4 (legal version), that is another big plus. 

Each of the positions below will have a lead position, must have worked on a previous game-title and be able to manage their team. They should do things like: Give information as to how to do particular things, teach people how to optimize their code(programmers), be willing to check through submitted work and give suggestions or be able to fix it themselves. These lead positions will naturally get a bigger cut of final profits. Concept artists and voice actors do not have lead positions. I will still be available for comment on all submissions and the leads must report to me and be willing to listen to my ideas and suggestions. 

Here are the open positions:
Concept Artists: Must have a great imagination and excellent artistic skills. The concept artist will need to be able to express my ideas (and of course their own) through their creations with relative ease and create a very clear concept for reference. 

3D Artist: Must have experience with programs such as 3DS Max or Maya. Blender is acceptable, LODs and the such. If you specialize in a particular field (vegetation, characters, environments) let us know! Must be willing to communicate with texturers if you do not texture your own models.

Texture Artist: Similar knowledge and requirements to the 3D artist. Excellent drawing skills and knowledge of texturing is required as well. Must be willing to co-operate with the 3D modelers and work together to create the best looking assets possible.

3D Animator: Experience with animation programs such as 3DS Max

Programmers: Should have great knowledge C# and possibly Java (Current code is all C#). You must also be experienced with Unity programming and be able to create the essential systems and gameplay mechanics the project will require. 

Sound Artist: Inventive
Sound Artist-Music: Must be a musical person that can truly capture the atmosphere and emotion of a particular scene. Should be able to implement music into Unity 4. 
Sound Artist-Dialogue: Similar qualities as above

Voice actors: 
If you have an awesome voice
Protagonist: This is the most important role in the voice acting category. I am looking for a particular kind of voice to fill this position as the entire narrative and even some dialogue sequences will be voiced by this character. 
Little girl: Relatively small role
Woman: Another relatively small role
Additional voice actors (male and female) for enemies and other roles: If you have an interesting voice

Open-category: If you have any other talents that can assist in bringing this project to life

Steam/E-Mail: antonqvarfordt@gmail.com

I also want to stress that it's NOT trying to be retro or trying to be ""like"" anything. We use the tools, music and gameplay features we think are cool and would be fun but most importantly interesting, moving and funny. ""Engaging"" is more important than ""Entertaining"". Did you think of a feature that would be cool, maybe a gameplay mechanic that's witty, engaging and could maybe act as a methafor through gameplay, or something like that, in the game? Then great, but there will be a million things i don't want it to  be like. However my point is you will be creatively enabled

I'm going to stop now

I currently have a basic engine for the game.  If I continue at the pace I'm going

It's written in Javascript / HTML5 and will be playable in most browsers.

As far as the specific assets I'll need

* Main character with animated cycle [standing guard
* 8 Monsters with animated cycle [standing guard
* 5-6 pickup items
* GUI elements [HUD, etc.]
* 2-3 tilesets
* A handful of miscellaneous effects [taking damage

Hey Devs

We're still working on growing our team so we came to you guys. We are an Ottawa-based company
The project is called CoreTechs. The game: has collectible cards; is primarily small-scale, multiplayer game set in a cyberpunk universe. Think Magic the Gathering on a hex-tile board.
We have a facebook page up: [CoreTechs on Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/CoreTechs.Team) 
for anyone who wants to take a look.
Here's our work-in-progress website with our Wiki that contains rules and such - 
[CoreTechs on Home](http://coretechsgame.com/)
There is quite a bit of material that I can send out for those that would like more details.

Here are the **positions** we're looking to fill:

* **Graphic artist**
* logos
* buttons
* banners
* UI skinning

* **Concept Artists**
* characters
* environments

I'm working alone and paying out of pocket so obviously I can't pay studio rates, texture, rig, and animations.

Technical Requirements:

1. Must use 3DS MAX 2011 or earlier (for #2)

2. Models must be exported using KW X-Port. This is non negotiable. Models having multiple animations that can be blended together do NOT work correctly in XNA unless this exporter is used. If you have experience using this it's a huge plus.

3. XNA can be very picky about importing models, or vertices are duplicated or not weighted to any bone.

Your task would require you to have complete understanding of a C++ programming language and also a have strong background in SDL.

The project we would be working on is a 2D RPG.

You would be also involved in designing the game with me.

Your specific task would be building the game engine.

 - Meaning besides some specific design rules. You would have creative freedom to do as you see fit.
 - Meaning using the SDL to load and display images.

 - Meaning handling the user input.

 - Meaning triggering the scripts once the player (or NPC) enters the certain area.


My tasks would be:
 - Building an active user UI

    * Meaning I will build all of UI. (In game and otherwise). Of course all in SDL.

    * Meaning handling all of the player's inventory and the math behinds it. (player equips another weapon etc..)

    * Meaning Save/Load 

 - Net code. ( If we decide we need any ).


We will use a ""Tiled"" teditor and a ""tmxlib"" for scripting and SDL for representations of the tiles on screen.

I already have a musician who will compose audiotrack.  And I know of an artist who will be happy to join. (worked with him before).

I'm also a writer on this project. And the main premise is that we ( our society as it is now ) are invaded by a force we don't understand. We are slaves now. Tasked only to breed and work. 

The main prologue would be like this for the protagonist: (story concept. Intro)

""And the moon shines bright once again. He raise his eyes and his soul cries out. 
""How long... How long must we endure this. Slaves for another? Why?"" 
And from his suffered eye a single tear shed. 
A tear of happiness
That tear were we.

1342482470.0,wo76i,[LFP] Client needed for very simple multiplayer Turn-based Strategy. [Hobby],DarkAgesRP,5,2,0,"I'm currently working on getting a Turn-based Strategy/RPG ready for initial testing but have come across a flaw in my plan. The initial idea was for the game to be play-by-email

The game is a hex-based mediaeval RPG/Strategy in which each player is a Feudal Lord. A large part of the gameplay is diplomacy- meaning lots of discussion and negotiation. The easiest way to handle this would be letting players email each other the majority of the time, your communications could be intercepted. This would be handled by the GM (me) but isn't possible if I don't have access to chat logs to simulate this. Of course I could simply use honour rules but... that never works.  

The other option would be forcing all communication to be done through the GM- but this would become unwieldy for larger games and the delay between messages would be terrible for playability.  

Another issue is that the game has essentially no cap to size. I designed the game around 30-50 players but can imagine larger numbers improving gameplay substantially. This would turn the GM's job from a hobby to a full-time job.

The easiest way out I can see is to have a dedicated client where players can chat, and all that jazz.  All chat messages can be copied into the GM's inbox so that they can process them but still letting players chat freely. This would vastly improve the flow of the game and decrease the workload on the GM exponentially.     

I can expand more if you have any questions

I realize that most of the recruiters here aren't located in Poland

I mostly work with FlashPunk, and AS3 without an external framework to a lesser extent. I do everything in FlashDevelop making use of classes and OOP. Other than AS3 I also love to code in C# - it's much better than AS3, imo :D

My current project is a puzzle game called Qublox

**I also have a lot of unfinished prototypes that are each about 5-10 hours into development:**

[CavernDash](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53503414/CavernDash-AKLOS.swf) - a clone of the classic BoulderDash games.

[Stickman Card Battle](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53503414/StickmanCardBattle.swf) - a strategic ""card game"" where the player fights against an AI by using cards from a hand of 5 randomly picked cards.

[EatTheFlies](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53503414/EatTheFlies.swf) - this is a simple tug-o-war game idea I had. Click on the screen to ""eat flies"" before the hunger bar reaches zero and click on the frog to buy upgrades.

[BoomChime](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53503414/BoomChime.swf) - a chain reaction game based on ""BoomShine"".

[BoundGame](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53503414/BoundGameFinal.swf) - a top down game where the player must get to the end of what is essentially an obstacle course. Press SPACE to jump

[BreakinBalls](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53503414/BreakinBalls-AKLOS.swf) - a physics game where the player tries to launch a ball into other balls and break enough of them to pass a level. I used Box2D for the physics in this

[LDGame](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53503414/LDGame.swf) - this was going to be my submission for the last Ludum Dare competition. Mouse controls

The company was founded by veterans of the video game industry with experience developing for PC, Xbox 360, Playstation 3, and the mobile market of Android and iPhone/iPad. While we will primarily be developing and publishing our own titles

Our goal is to make high quality games for audiences of all ages. Down the road

    
**Myself (Michael):**   
I've worked on four video game titles. The first release was for PC with a small game developer, PC). I also worked on two iPhone games. The last 2 years I have been a Lead Coach at Microsoft for the Xbox 360. I have a Bachelors in GSP (Game and Simulation Programming) from DeVry University, and I also spent two years studying Entrepreneurship. 

Production is my love. Most people are surprised to hear this, handling documents, relaying communications, and most importantly, making sure the team has access all the tools they need to succeed. I also enjoy working with the Microsoft suite (Project, Excel, Word, Outlook

All the art for the games I've worked on so far are done by myself and it's pretty rudimentary. More info on my work so far can be found on http://tuttlegames.com/

I'm pretty open minded about the style but I prefer a sort of stripped down look, for now these are just for fun; I just think it'd be nice to be able to focus on the programming/game design aspect of things and have a partner around to do the art assets.

These would include level backgrounds, so it's not just a ""hey I need you to draw X with Y colors and Z expression, no I don't like the door, show me another..."" kind of deal.

The August game--the one we'd be starting with--is a somber/serious one that aims for a cinematic experience. The theme word for this month is ""PHILOSOPHY"" and we'll be exploring a few concepts about human nature and whatnot (don't want to give away the ending!).

The game is a homage to System Shock 2 and Thief, to name a few.

Dynamically the game will work something like a combination of the aforementioned games in this post; the game involves the use of stealth, in a forest based on the real-life Aokigahara, a forest underneath Mt. Fuji, famous for suicide. The challenge is presented in the player's ability to avoid situations that will affect their character's sanity level, which will diminish in varying ways depending on interactions with the environment and enemies.

The player will proceed through the game recovering articles and more alluding to his eventual discovery of the reasons which have brought him to this place

I am offering my services to anyone who is interested.  I am a quality game designer.  
I offer assistant game design services to anyone who has a crew that makes games.  

My credentials:
I've designed games my entire life. I've also logged over 10, and AS3(Flash).  I've played video games since 1980, and they have been my major point of interest since then.  I treated them as if one day they'd become a professional sport since I was a very young age.  So I was among the best in the world for Starcraft/Diablo 2 hardcore/Warcraft 3 because I at one point held a #1 on each ladder.  

I coded and assist game designed Dungeon Run:http://www.shockwave.com/gamelanding/dungeon-run.jsp

I coded a puzzle game: http://goodnewsjim.com/DiamondDrop/HowToPlay.html

I coded a way to play pencil and paper RPGs: http://www.abcrpg.com/

I was working on MMORPGS solo since 1992.

I'm working on an episodic MMORPG now with Dungeon Run's engine as programmer/designer called Throne And Crown.

I'm also working a 3d game called Crystal Fighter which is going to be like Tekken meets League of Legends: The old webpage for when I was making it a MMORPG is here: http://www.goodnewsjim.com/js2/work/roaming.html

I am currently programming two projects

I have a game design blog where I talk about things on my mind at: www.crystalfighter.com

The reason why I am doing this:

*I'm looking to help other teams solidify their game.  

*My coding background helps me know what is easily implementable.  

*My game design background knows what is fun in previous games I've played

*I can help guide the development of your game.  

*I can tell you new features to add

*I am somewhat creative

*I choose to be an assistant game designer as to help you form your idea and develop the game you envisioned.  

*I will have more titles worked on.

*Complex game design is easy for me

So my offer is to become an assistant game designer for a fair negotiated rate.  I'm down for % of revenue of a finished product

I'm a programmer
Here is the mid-term game I made with a partner in class: http://www.materialpoetics.com/Hatchlinks/Hatchlinks.html  
This is a 10 weeks work.

Through some unfortunate circumstances, so I left. By that time, there was nobody left without a team.

I have a concept
The document contains a link to a first prototype.
It also contains a link to some pixel art I made

There are two ways we can work together.  
1. If you want to develop the game as 50-50 partners. We share game design decisions
2. I can pay you. I'm not sure how much I can pay

Wanted to let you guys know I'm having a huge Summer Sale. 20% off ALL music libraries! If you've been looking for professional video game music now's a good time to pick up a library or 2 for you future games. Also

A few libraries I'd like to highlight:
KINGDOM OF LIGHT BASIC/STAND/PREMIUM EDITION: This is a huge library of cinematic quality  music for RPG / adventure type games. Definitely check this out if you're needing high quality orchestra music. I think it's an amazing deal for the amount of music

KINGDOM OF LIGHT MODULES: Music of the KoL in modules for those needing just tavern music, tavel music, etc..packages instead of 192 minutes of all orchestra music.

KINGDOM OF LIGHT - COMBAT:  A module of close combat (skirmished) and Epic Battles. Loops included for prolonged fights.

KINGDOM OF LIGHT - Dungeons &amp; Caves: A popular KoL module that brings the same cinematic quality like the rest of the KoL libraries for your dungeons

TITAN SCI-FI: The music from this is one of my best selling products. It brings new material and combines the music libraries Atmospheric Sound Design, celestial bodies and great sounding drones and ambient tracks.

CUSTOM MUSIC: I should be available for custom tracks soon for those needing something specific for your games. Starting prices for basic custom cues start @ $50 per minute. However

Thanks guys and have a safe summer/winter!

**If you have an don't have asset list or don't know how much to charge**

It's super helpful to know your budget too. I try to spend enough time on your project that i work an hour for each 15$ you send over. So if you send 50$

But no matter your budget or project size

**If you are still in the 'prototyping phase'**

I've done 80$ prototyping deals with great effect for this community. I've done 4 so far. Basically, a player character and some background elements.

I have a game that I've been working on for over a year now,  but needs more help to make it really work right.

This is where you come in!

I'm at the point where I'm realizing that I really should be collaborating with someone else on this

So, and an animated rider. But, it's not good enough yet, and needs some TLC. 

**That in mind

* Experience in Unity. Or just starting out
* Experience in programming
* Desire or experience in 2 wheeled vehicle physics. I'm trying to create the best mounting biking simulation available. Does that interest you?
* On the West Coast, is ideal. 
* Wants to have fun
* Bonus: You are a mountain biker! 

**About me:**

* I'm a mountain biker and amateur (very amateur) game developer. 
* I can low poly model (3ds max) and texture characters and in game assets. 
* I'm a web designer and can do all kinds of 2d design. (Gui Logos etc..)
* Fairly new to Unity 

Please respond addressing the above points, but I feel like the right person is out there somewhere. Skilled in programming and Unity, and wants to get their first or second game under their belt. Maybe someone currently in school for game dev, or just fresh out?

There is a good demand for this type of game. I hope to get a solid alpha running and then do a Kickstarter

I have a temporary site up. You can learn more about the game

**Thanks!!**

1370200144.0,1fj6zf,[P]rogrammer looking to join or create team,CyruzDraxs,3,0,6,"I'm looking for a weekend project. I'm serious about making a good game

I'm located in Vancouver, so that's fine too.

I'm a web app developer that has done game dev as a hobby for years. I'm very deep-rooted in the web app dev community, including adding MRuby as a supported language. And I contributed a bit to the Moai engine, but it's kind of a mess. :(

**My game dev experience**

I've worked with a wide variety of languages and libraries including; Visual Basic, C++, Java, Objective-C, SDL, DirectX, OpenGL, OpenAL, Javascript, Torque2D

I got started in programming by making a 2D online RPG with Visual Basic and DirectX about 10 years ago while in high school. The graphics were ripped from various SNES games. It was effectively a gamified chatroom for my friends and I

I also made some Gameboy Advance demo games. One was a short mario clone and mainly a 2d physics experiment. The other was a mini RPG

After that, and it's been used in most tile-based XNA games since.

I worked on an engine several years ago called [JSGame](https://github.com/Qard/jsgame)

About a year and a half ago I joined a mobile games company. I created the Peint rendering engine for HTML5 and canvas while working for them. I didn't really enjoy the games I was building though. I wanted time to work on stuff I actually *wanted* to create

I have complete confidence in my coding abilities

**Samples**

I don't have too much to show as most of the more interesting stuff I've done was years ago

**What I'm looking for**

- Not interested in web. I do Javascript all day at work
- I want to work on 2D stuff; ideally using the Polycode engine.
- Story and style are important. I want to make something unique.
- Don't really want to do core engine stuff. Would prefer rapid prototyping to toiling with engine innards.",self,t5_2sg66,1370203332.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/1fj6zf/programmer_looking_to_join_or_create_team/
