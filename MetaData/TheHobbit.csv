I had a talk tonight with one of the main robotics/animatronics experts that worked on The Hobbit. If you remember the scene just before Riddles in the dark where Bilbo falls with a Goblin

After some chatting, so there is no real good time to suit the US portion of our members. I have decided to open this topic as a free forum for asking questions. Obviously he won't be able to answer everything, but if you have any questions regarding the film, working at weta, robotics in the Hobbit, special effects, whatever

I will point him at this topic and let him answer as much or little as he wants. I'm also trying to work out a couple of other AMAs in the near future. I know one of our Hobbit friends was trying to get an AMA going with Bombur from The Hobbit and had been discussing it on Twitter.

Ok, there's a good chance he'll answer :)

&gt;**An unexpected journey**
&gt;
&gt;It is only at the end of a shoot that you finally get the chance to sit down and have a look at the film you have made. Recently Fran, the strength of the characters and the cast who have brought them to life.  All of which gave rise to a simple question: do we take this chance to tell more of the tale? And the answer from our perspective as the filmmakers, and as fans, was an unreserved ‘yes.'  
&gt; 
&gt;We know how much of the story of Bilbo Baggins, the rise of the Necromancer, and the Battle of Dol Guldur will remain untold if we do not take this chance.  The richness of the story of The Hobbit, as well as some of the related material in the appendices of The Lord of the Rings, allows us to tell the full story of the adventures of Bilbo Baggins and the part he played in the sometimes dangerous, but at all times exciting, history of Middle-earth.
&gt; 
&gt;So, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Wingnut Films, and the entire cast and crew of “The Hobbit” films, **I’d like to announce that two films will become three.** 
&gt; 
&gt;It has been an unexpected journey indeed
&gt; 
&gt;Cheers
&gt;

1355237626.0,14o04w,"[Spoilers] Just got back from the public world premiere, at the Embassy Theatre in Wellington. My thoughts on The Hobbit, and 48fps/3D.",chimpwithalimp,124,89, 3.30am

First and foremost let me give some words of encouragement. If you like The Hobbit book, its pretty much non-stop story and action, and its a fantastic journey. Everything from the first third of the book is there, with some extras which I'll mention later.

**48fps and 3D**: Right from the Warner Bros title spinning in high frame rate and 3D, it did take me a good five or ten minutes to start to properly like it, because what everyone says is true. Its more like watching a play or seeing it live than watching a movie, until your mind adjusts to it. The bad part of that is that the whole ""Old Bilbo"" prologue was a little ruined for me because I was far more distracted by the look and feel of the HFR than of the words being spoken. However, once your eyes and mind click into gear and catch up, you just see a beautiful, smooth, its breathtaking. The 3D was well done too

**Changes to the book:** I'd describe this movie as being the first third of The Hobbit
[spoiler](#s ""There is a new big bad guy called the Pale Orc
[spoiler](#s ""Also
For the most part

**CGI:** CGI has come a huge way even since the original LotR trilogy and its put to great use here. There are certain scenes as some feared that are plainly CGI

**The Dwarves**: Each dwarf is visually unique but honestly only a few stand out. Most are filler, but the direction has obviously (to me) put forward a few dwarves into the limelight as being more important. I'm not talking Thorin, I'm talking Bofur. He has several emotional close up scenes, whereas some of the dwarves, I genuinely can't put a look to their name. Its as if they were made intentionally forgettable, unfortunately. Perhaps in pt2 and 3, they'll focus on others.

**Smaug**: Cumberbatch revealed on some talk show that [spoiler](#s ""you get to see Smaugs eye in this movie. There's a little more than that

**The mood and atmosphere:** If all six Middle Earth movies were to be lined up with the Hobbit trilogy first, much like the Harry Potter movies managed. With that in mind, this movie is very much full of comedy, lightness, fun but also a lot of fighting and action. The sense of bleak desperation isn't there - yet - so we have that ahead of us. A friend described it as a ""comedy version of a LotR movie"", which I think was going a little far. Perhaps a light hearted version is more correct.



After the slow start I mentioned, sometimes deviation to a side plot before returning. Parts of it differed significantly in look and location to what I pictured from the books. If anyone knows Figwit, he gets a far bigger part in this movie, with several lines. Not sure I liked it, seemed a little pandering to the fans, that one.

All in all, and a point for what I perceive to be unnecessary diversions to the book, making for some length issues. People were shifting around in their seats at times, during some of the slower scenes.

Thoughts appreciated :)

That being said I don't think the hobbit: an unexpected journey is a perfect film and is not nearly as good as lord of the rings.  I just don't think it deserved all the hate its gotten.  It makes the Star Wars prequels look absolutely terrible

I think after the next two films come out everyone will look kinder on this film trilogy as a whole.

What's your opinion?

This happens  to be both 100% correct and still not a good reason to not like the film.  The story arcs from the book cannot translate to the film medium without alteration.  Due to the scope and size of the film

To illustrate, noble and has his eye ever on the prize.  All his angst and training and toil is behind him.  In the movies he is unsure of himself, disconnected from his kin.  The sacrifice of Boromir as well as Frodo's growth change him from reluctant heir to cautiously optimistic leader.  The next movie sees him accept his role as king by inspiring and assisting his subjects (Rohan).  He risks his life to inspire and save the world he had rejected (I often think the Anduril scene should have come at the end of TTT as a pay-off.  The Third movie is where he fulfills his destiny in spite of overwhelming odds.  After Pellenor, he could have assumed his throne and left Frodo to rot.  Gandalf would have been powerless to stop him.  That is an arc that pays out over the films for just one character.

When you see a change was made between book and film, I'm looking at you).  While Gimli suffers from Jar-Jar syndrome at times, his overall arc as ""insular Dwarf who learns Elves aren't totally bad and sometimes natural beauty beats forged steel and polished gems"" works.

So let's talk about The Hobbit.  This movie focuses on a few key characters in a possible crop of 15, a key to screen-time success.  I trust they will have roles to play before the end (all in good time).

The two main characters are Bilbo and Thorin whose arcs are intertwined like yin and yang.  Bilbo's arc is modified significantly from the book much to the purist's chagrin.  He finds his courage much earlier, Thorin distrusts Bilbo and only trusts himself so much that it takes multiple thumps over the head to make him realize it (confound the stubbornness of dwarves).  This could not have been done waiting to the next movie as the quest hangs on Bilbo so much as to make it unbelievable.

But I have to say that a few things left me kinda perplexed; especially

1) In the prologue, if we consider just Erebor, it's kind of a small mountain, in extension there are lots of countries larger than that, even the Shire is larger! The only way it could hold up is if we consider also all the Longbeard Dwarves living scattered everywhere, from the Grey Hills to the Blue Mountains, since Thror was King of the Durin's Folk, right? But it's kind of stretching the point to me. Another option would be to consider the phrase as the sense of 'most powerful' and 'richest', Gondor hasn't fallen THAT deep

2) Of course it had to be Balin explaining the Moria part (which is correct, in the LOTR movie it was just a passing note, in the book he was branded as stupid for trying to return to Moria, and in the Hobbit movie he's the most cautious of the gang!). But quite frankly, that part is kinda confusing; either we take it that the battle was so fierce that almost all of the Dwarves died and only a few remained (and that would be part of the reason the other Dwarven clans refuse to help, as Thorin said), or else it furthers the subplot of Thror's madness caused by his ring, since the Balrog kicked their butts!

The change in fps is unmissable from the outset, which is why I failed to initially see why Peter Jackson had chosen to film at double the frame rate. However, as soon as you reach the first scene which uses masses of CGI, you begin to truly appreciate how much of a difference it makes.

The easiest way to describe it is that it seems to close the gap (which has up until now been really quite vast in my opinion) between distinguishing real-life characters and computer generated ones. There is next to no blur

I'd like to start off by putting on record that I thoroughly enjoyed An Unexpected Journey

Looking forward to The Desolation of Smaug, my anticipation has grown. It is looking to be a very beautiful, and yet darker, and more serious film than the first, which I think I will enjoy. The only problems I have with this so far are

-Tauriel - for some of the same reasons as Azog, but remains a fantastic, wondrous masterpiece. I think that is something that nay-sayers have to accept, or else something like this happens. Furthermore, I believe that to support the creation of female characters is to take for granted the various significant, (and sometimes quite badass) female characters already in the Tolkien universe, such as Galadriel, Arwen, Yavanna, Nessa

-More Azog - Though I knew this was inevitable by his survival in An Unexpected Journey

Thankfully

Now, but I believe that There and Back Again has the potential to be completely true to the book, or the closest thing to it for a film adaption. Here are the only things that would need to happen for that to be possible:

-Limit Tauriel's role to Mirkwood, I do not think it is very likely to go this way because of Tauriel's dialogue in the trailer ""It is our fight"" - which to me means she is eager to get involved in the conflicts happening in the outside world (i.e. the fight for Erebor). If they do bring her outside of Mirkwood, let's just hope that they don't play her role up too largely, which would definitely have the potential to put a huge dent in the purity of such sequences as the Treasure Negotiations and the Battle of Five Armies. Alternatively, giving her a dramatic, heroic death would surely satisfy the writers' cravings for a significant female role, although I doubt this will happen, give them as much depth as possible

-Kill off Azog in the The Desolation of Smaug- I think the general consensus on Azog's presence here is negative, the better. Here is why I think killing off Azog in the Desolation of Smaug would be the perfect thing to do:

-This film takes place around the middle of the book, they barely accomplish anything at all. Thorin's triumph over Azog would add a major plot sequence to the film that would help hold the attention of (mostly non-reader) audiences.

-It would make room for Bolg- Bolg is one of the most important parts of the Battle of Five armies. Discovering his father's death would be a great way to instill rage in him, other than just the death of the Great Goblin and rumor of Smaug's death.

-It would get rid of the other unnecessary non-cannon character

So that is my take on the trilogy at this point. If you've made it this far,,False,self,t5_2sfnk,1375673115.0,,True

1356939267.0,15pqzz,"My ""An Unexpected Journey"" Review -  A Look at The Major Differences between the Book and the Movie",lordleycester,48,8,6,"*Edit*: **WARNING MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD** sorry


So this is a little late

****

**1) The Frame Story**

Unlike the book, it’s done very similarly, with the beginning of AUJ tying back to the beginning of FOTR.

Another thing the frame story does is give a lot of exposition on Erebor and its Fall, but more on that later).

I think that the frame story works perfectly and is in fact taking a leaf out of Tolkien

   **2) Thorin’s character arc**

In the book, and you’re not a king. So you’re nobody really.” Book!Thorin seems to act all regal in spite of this.

Movie!Thorin on the other hand is painfully aware of being a nobody and wants to rectify this. And that feeling of inadequacy makes him much more reserved than he is in the book. Movie!Thorin is also much less interested in gold than he is in regaining a homeland for his people. I think this will make the dragon sickness he succumbs to at the end more poignant. 

**3) Bilbo’s character arc**

I found the way they changed Bilbo’s character arc very interesting. In the original Hobbit

In the book Bilbo is your typical hobbit: he doesn’t care for adventures and when the dwarves come knocking he’s a bit flustered but he plays the gracious host all the same. He finally decides to join the quest at the end of the Unexpected Party because the dwarves hurt his pride and “he would go without bed and breakfast to be thought fierce”. He’s only late the next day because he overslept. 

In the movie, as if the mere mention of adventure troubles him. Look at the indignant way he says: “I don’t think anyone west of Bree would have any interest in adventures.”. Contrast this to book!Bilbo who’s reactions seems to be more “lol that dude is crazy and a teensy bit creepy” and actually invites Gandalf to tea the next day. And when the dwarves start coming, he almost immediately tries to throw them out again. He outright refuses to join the quest, even as Gandalf reminds him how adventurous he used to be. 

To me, he can’t resist anymore and finally decides to run after the dwarves.

This makes a lot of the other changes to Bilbo’s storyline in the movie much more reasonable. Hobbit!Bilbo might never have been quick thinking enough to mislead the trolls, is able to. The same goes for jumping at the orcs to try and protect Thorin towards the end of the movie. This change, IMO, is very much in line with what Tolkien might have done if he persisted with his intention to rewrite The Hobbit to bring it in line with LOTR. 
 
**4) The relationship between Elves and Dwarves**

This is another rather interesting change

In the LOTR movies it’s clear that there’s dwarves and elves are generally on less than friendly terms. It would be jarring if they were perfectly hunky-dory with each other in the Hobbit movies. But the audience will also be expecting an explanation of why there’s such enmity between the two races. All good Tolkien geeks know that the canonical explanation for this can be found in the Silmarillion

And as far as that goes, since it definitely can’t play out the way it did in the book. Thranduil will definitely recognize Thorin and probably will be able to guess the nature of the dwarves’ quest so I wonder what his reaction will be.

The thing that makes the change problematic to me is that they make no distinction between the different types of elves I.e. the Noldor and the Sindar. Thorin’s beef (which is a pretty recent one, some of whom still live in Rivendell.  And the Noldor and the Sindar don’t always get along anyway. 

I guess these kind of subtleties are hard to portray on film but oddly enough it’s small stuff like this that bothers me the most. Taking out Tom Bombadil and the Scouring of the Shire I’m fine with

**5) The Azog subplot**

This is probably the change I like the least but I can see the reasons behind it. In the book, with the whole “Thorin hates elves” subplot they introduced, they need to force the dwarves to go to Rivendell.

So this change kills two birds with one stone and gives the orcs chasing the dwarves a more personal undertone (""My name is Thorin Oakenshield, and that Bolg will be a connection to the White Council storyline.

So this is a change I'm totally on board with

**6) The White Council storyline**

One thing that PJ likes to do in the movies is compress the timelines. In the books 17 years pass between the Long-Expected Party and Frodo setting out with the Ring. In the movie it looks like a few weeks have passed at the most. He seems to be doing the same thing with the White Council storyline. 

According to the Tale of the Years in Appendix B of LOTR, the same year as the events of the Hobbit.

Now it’s very problematic to show this on film. Why does it take so long for Gandalf to identify Sauron and for the White Council to finally drive him out? What are the Nazgul doing during this millenium? Even Tolkien does little to explain any of this except for the fact that Saruman kept counseling against doing anything about Dol Guldur. This raises another problem: if Saruman is acting so suspiciously why does Gandalf seem to trust him so implicitly in the FOTR movie?

So the filmmakers try to solve these problems by compressing the timeline even more than they did in the LOTR movies. Radagast (instead of Gandalf) identifies the Necromancer almost immediately after he reoccupies Dol Guldur

Gandalf presents this discovery to the White Council. PJ doesn’t want Saruman to be acting too blatantly suspicious thereby removing the only obstacle to attacking the Necromancer

Usually this is the kind of change I’m okay with; I can see how it’s necessary, that is now known by the vulgar as Deadman’s Dike…” I can just picture thousands of movie fans’ eyes rolling into the back of their heads. 

But I'm a little worried about how this affects other storylines, you get the impression that Isildur was the last king of Gondor and really no indication of Arnor even existing, so I guess it stays consistent within the movieverse at least. 

****

Although I'm a film fan

But I like Tolkien.  A fan

So I went...

**I have never stared in utter disbelief at a film since I was a little kid.**  There were so many scenes where my mouth was literally slack, a puff of smoke there.  Three hours flew by and I wanted more.  I didn't care what-- just let me continue experiencing that world.  Maybe a pie eating contest at the Shire.  Anything!

Cognitively the film had its flaws.  But in terms of a movie going experience

In one early scene the Dwarves smoke pipes and sing a mournful song about their wandering.  Smoke has never been seen like this before!  The song, the looks on all their faces --you believed it when Bilbo chased after them the next morning.  You were there, and you wanted to go, too.

At the end of the film

I sat in my chair, a believer in what had just happened.  

**Why did this ""renew my faith in humanity?""**  Because the three film project is so monumental and such a risk that rightly it should not even have been attempted.  But not only was it attempted

The vast technologies required should never have come together.  But they did, the Hobbit could have been a very modest offering for a modest adventure.

There is a cyniccal modesty that moves people to propose the Hobbit should only be one film

&gt; The Hobbit is too long.  It's boring.  Nothing happens.  I hate dwarves singing.  There are too many details.  Radagast is not in the book.  The plot doesn't move step by step like other films I like.  They made three parts to make more money.

Yet this risk of length that allows the film to actually approximate the works of Tolkien

&gt; Yes, and unfinished tales.  

That is exactly what the Hobbit is!

&gt; But don't worry

Just picture the movie executive staring out the window

People have this thing completely backward.  From a risk perspective

What a victory for storytelling over streamlining a product.

Take the sequence at Bilbo's hobbit hole.  Executives watching this had to fight against it.  You know they must have argued that it was too long

I got the sense Jackson sat before the studio heads and said

&gt; Let's not be modest for a change

And it happened.  It's real.  I'm a believer.

That's why the Hobbit renewed my faith in humanity.",self,t5_2sfnk,False,review,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheHobbit/comments/14zp9s/the_hobbit_renewed_my_faith_in_humanity/

There wasn't.  I tried to make my eyes see something ""different"" but the only thing they reported back was that the image was bright and crystal clear.  The one and only thing that I truly noticed was that I never had to adjust my 3D glasses trying to see better like I constantly do in regular frame rate.

After the film ended I found myself surrounded by happy fans with quite a range of ages.  My sister had gone with me and has a terrible time with 3D
