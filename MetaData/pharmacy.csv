This makes me believe one of two things. One, this seems very unlikely because I was taking bong rips the night before the test and I am a daily smoker). Two, Quest tried to call me but had an incorrect phone number. If this was the case, I believe they would have contacted my Walgreens to get my phone number so they could have the MRO call me. 

My store manager called a former DM to ask about my situation. The ex-DM said it can take the district office up to 3 weeks to come down to fire someone. It's also apparently not unheard of for the district office to sweep incidents under the rug (for example, October 26th) since the district people often come down on inventory days anyways. 

Since this thread is getting kind of buried in /r/pharmacy, as even though I disagree with you, I still respect your opinion and it has caused me to look at my situation with a new perspective. If nothing else, it has allowed me to see the perspective that the district people will have in the event that I have a confrontation with them about the positive UDS. 

If there are any other pharmacist cannabis-consumers out there, please never go to work under the influence of any substance, we do have patients' lives in our hands. What you do at your home is your business, and your business alone. Everyone take care, and do good for goodness' sake. I'll update you all in a new thread ASAP, and I'll continue responding to comments and specific questions in the meantime. 

EDIT: It looks as if I'll be terminated. My store manager says I should walk out voluntarily before the District people come down to fire me on Monday. I'm waiting for the pharmacy manager to call me back to see if there is any way he can intercede for me. I'm still unsure if I should effectively quit at the end of my shift tomorrow or wait for them to tell me I failed and act completely surprised and demand a retest. I'm also unsure if this will go all the way to the Board of Pharmacy. Any advice

This is a throwaway for anonymity...

Here's the scoop. I'm a pharmacist at a major pharmacy chain, but does anyone out there (especially pharmacists) have any first hand experience or advise with my situation? I'm thinking that the worst-case scenario is I lose my job and my license is suspended, and the best-case scenario is I go on probation with my employer and have to pay for drug rehabilitation counseling.",,False,,t5_2qjl3,,http://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/11bopw/im_a_pharmd_for_a_major_pharmacy_chain_who_likely/

As difficult as it might seem let's try to keep political and ethical viewpoints out of it. If you want to debate whether or not health care is a right there are posts in other subreddits for that.

That being said, patients) think the Affordable Care Act will have on the profession. I have heard plenty of physicians express their disapproval but I feel like pharmacists (the ones I know) have stayed pretty tight lipped about it.

Interesting points of discussion might include changes to the pharmacist's role in patient care, demand for jobs, Pharm.D education, or anything else you find relevant.

I am a pharmacy student and will admit that I don't know all of the components of the legislation. My impression from what I have heard/read thus far has been a negative one. Here's a few things that come to mind.

A.) **Greater generic availability** - sounds great on the surface. Cheaper drugs available to more people

B.) **Changes in reimbursement** - still not clear on all dynamics of this. If I had to take a stab in the dark I would say 3rd party reimbursement pay in both community and clinical settings will decrease. If this happens I think those changes will be reflected in RPh salary. Possibly through mandatory mail order? I don't know

C.) **Pay by performance measures** - will pharmacist pay be based on how many times their patients skip a dose or refill medications? Not likely

D.) **Greater role in patient care** - this is the only possible outcome that has come to my mind that seems positive. If pharmacy is given a greater scope of practice it could increase jobs by creating new roles for the Pharm.D to fill.

That's all I have for now. So now I want to hear - what do you think?

After all if the patient will keep eating unhealthy it is obvious that he will have to keep taking statins to keep his cholesterol in check and that will result in more side effects

Betty Dong was a strongly against switching patients from brand-name thyroid replacement products to generics, however, was that there was absolutely no difference between the two. As any good scientist would, she wanted to publish these groundbreaking findings and submitted it to JAMA - despite the fact that she had publicly been against switching patients from brand to generic. Boots pharmaceuticals was pissed, ended up threatening to sue her and all those involved. She was forced to pull the article at the last minute, and the pharmaceutical company started published other articles discrediting Dr. Dong in other journals... eventually the Wall Street Journal figured out what the company was doing, the FDA stepped in

Pharmacy callers:

- We know you've been transferred a lot. It sucks, there's nothing we can do about it. The insurance companies hide behind us and will put our phone number on their cards instead of theirs. It's basically a filter system where we have to determine where callers go. It's terrible and we want it to change as much as you do, but we don't have the power. And getting mad at us or telling us you've been transferred a lot only wastes both of our times. :/

- Yes, patient name and dob, your name, phone number and npi number for the pharmacy, pharmacy name, etc. 

- You know how most of you guys are calling in for processing information on patients' new plans? Well, but having the patient order a new card is useless -- it will likely have the same information. 

- Speaking of processing information, the fields don't update to reflect your new info. For example: you process with a BIN number of 12345 and a PCN of AB, if you later update that same claim with BIN 98765 and PCN of CD, the new claim will still have the old info. Usually cashing out the claim or backing it out then reprocessing will work. This seems to be a problem with all chains of pharmacies. This is also a common problem with DUR codes. Basically, if updating information doesn't work, try starting the claim over and reprocessing.

- We know that you hate it when we suggest calling your software vendor for assistance, we're the processor, not the actual insurance company. We can't change any information. If you're using information we give you to process a claim, etc, and it doesn't work when it clearly should be, we have no choice but to refer you there. 

- As you may have guessed, this type of work requires lots of knowledge on the topic and attention to detail, but we have to work with what we've got. If you have someone that you suspect is new and doesn't quite understand what you're saying, please be patient with them. If it gets bad enough, you can always ask for a supervisor but this should only be done if you feel you absolutely need one. They are just as busy as we are.

- In a related matter, especially with certain plans. 

- As a company, but our average time is expected to be around 3 minutes. While we try to make sure that we give accurate info, we also have to do so in a timely manner. So with all due respect, please don't ask questions like, ""How are you?"", etc. Also, please try to have all your info ready when we answer. We know you guys are multi-tasking, being prepared saves us all lots of trouble. :)

- In a related matter, but specifically, at the end of the call if you've gotten what you were looking for and you hear us giving our ""little speech"", feel free to go ahead and hang up. It won't hurt our feelings at all I promise.

- Lastly, PLEASE DO ***NOT*** hand the phone over to the patient because at our department, we are not allowed to disclose any information to them. All it does is get them mad that we can't talk to them. All they can do is contact their customer services number on their card if they have any questions.

- I think that's all for now. I feel like I'm forgetting some things, we're in the same boat as you. We're decent people just trying to do our job and so long as you're good with us, we'll be good back! :) There's a lot of things I'd be interested in learning about what you guys have to do in your system and whatnot, so please feel free to respond and ask any questions!

Doctors/Nurses

- The main reason you guys call in is for prior authorizations. At the department I work, it's a filter system!) and sometimes we have to refer you over to the plan itself (remember, we're not the plan! Just the processor!) We understand you were probably transferred 2-3 times just to get to us, but as I said, we can't issue PAs and we can only get you to the right department. :/ It would be nice if the cards had the number directly to the PA department, but I guess the logic is to direct to us so we can confirm the exact reject and what needs to be done. 

- A lot of your calls are also drug coverage related and we do our best to help you here. The main problem is that we aren't medically trained, I know that Levoxyl is the brand name for Levothyroxine. Keep that in mind if you need to know if certain meds are covered!

- I guess that's about it for you guys, we hate it as much as you guys do. Our systems only allow us to do what we're authorized to do and if we have to transfer you, we have no choice.

Colleges of pharmacy recently expanded to meet the predicted increase in pharmacists needed to provide patient care services. Now, let alone professional services. This situation may lead to what Brown described as the “perfect storm”—an oversupply of pharmacists coinciding with decreased demand. This situation would affect all pharmacists, regardless of practice setting.

When I say there is no tomorrow, we need to work harder to convince patients and payers of our value. Educate them about what you do to ensure that patients achieve their therapeutic goals through medication counseling and management. Discuss your clinical activities, interventions, and collaborations with other providers. Document your patient care activities so that you have proof of what you do. Integrate patient care activities into your daily practice, and follow through with targeted and comprehensive MTM interventions.

Pharmacy organizations need to help create different reimbursement models that pay pharmacists fairly for patient care activities. Reimbursement needs to go beyond our current model

Schools of pharmacy need to prepare students for the changing health care system, and document their activities effectively and efficiently.

He did a pill count and according to him everything checked out, this was supposedly the dose he was suppose to take that day but he wasnt completely sure or not.  The man was worried about double dosing.  He said he read in the pamphlet that it said not to take a double dose if you missed it.

When it comes down to it I'd rather not work overnights.  But I'd rather work overnights than be unemployed with 117k in student loans.

So, but the overnight pharmacists at my hosiptal rotate 7/70 with 1 week overnight, 1 week off, 1 week days, 1 week off, repeat so they can't really comment on the schedule itself.

Any input you can give would be greatly appreciated!

1358910431.0,173lfo,Rationale for formulary benzodiazepines ,psychauth,17,6,17,"I work almost exclusively with obtaining prior-authorizations/formulary exceptions at a psychiatric clinic and we have been bombarded with temporary supply letters for benzodiazepines since the start of 2013.  This has been a relatively painless process so far (aside from the tedious nature of it)

So far most of these requests have gone through other PBM's with ease despite them preferring some benzodiazepines over others and the non-preferred options have gotten approved.  WindsorRx on the other hand prefers diazepam (and one other I can't recall off the top of my head) over lorazepam and will not approve without relevant information documented in chart notes as to why the formulary options can't/won't be tried.  While I can provide this information most of the time

So my question is, like I stated above, they are in the same class and roughly the same cost?  I understand the concepts of drug formularies/step-therapy etc, and how usually they are in place for cost-saving and/or safety measures, but this one has me puzzled.  I've asked a few of the providers at work but they also are at a loss so I'm wondering if any redditor pharmacy folks may have some insight.

 So

**1) Begin developing good habits.** This means STOP CRAMMING! (I know it's a little too late for this in summer, pick up a fun, long-term hobby. This can be exercising, playing a sport, dancing, singing, cooking, whatever! The point is you want to lead a balanced life in order to de-stress during the difficult times in pharmacy school. 


**2) Develop networking skills.** Since the job market is narrowing, relies more on the people that you know. Begin making the effort to meet new people. Practice remembering the names, and finding conversation. Ask for a facebook add, email, or phone number to stay in touch. These skills should help for when you actually do become involved in organizations and conferences in pharmacy school. 


**3) Find a mentor** Out of all of your friends and family, but ask him or her if you can shadow or work. If not, obtain their contact information, and use them as a source for questions. Ask how the job market is, how to improve yourself, and how a pharmacy simply works. And who knows.. maybe after you get your intern license, they'll end up hiring you. 


**4) Learn your word roots.** Many times, then great! Review your old notes. Once you've covered that, move onto generic drug suffixes and their corresponding drug classes. Once you've done that, move on to memorizing generic and brand names. Do this in order; I think the results will be astounding. 

**5) Plan a career goal.** By now, try to pinpoint what you really want to accomplish in life as a pharmacist, and create a simple long-term plan with steps of how to get you there. You obviously won't know for sure what you want to do until you get your hands dirty, but taking these first steps can do wonders. 


Now, this probably is your most free summer before school, so ENJOY IT! What do you guys think? If you have additional suggestions, feel free to comment. 


**EDIT:** Just to clarify, do ask this before school starts. With the exception of shadowing/working in #3, you can easily enjoy your summer. 1) Picking up a hobby won't buy into your relaxation time; it's supposed to be fun. And chances are, you already have one. 2) ""Network"" at parties, bars, or hangouts. Simply, meet people and talk. Make friends. 3) You don't need to shadow or work, or you can take care of it in one week. You'd still end up having at least 2 months to yourself. 5) Ok, there is still time to refuse acceptance and re-plan your goals. Aside from all this, or to pursue a new skill you never had time to master before. I had a 3 month summer before pharmacy school to do all of the above
1359021172.0,176lfd,Dutch Pharmacist here. How come the USA has such a big problem in drug-shopping addicts?,LucoBuck,12,2,13,"It seems to me as if a big portion of a pharmacists work in the USA is to cope with addicts looking for opioids

In the Netherlands this is hardly a problem. If a pharmacist notices overuse of benzo's/opioid's without a proper indication he will contact the GP (or any other organization which supplies the prescription), they will contact the ""prescribing"" doctor and other pharmacies in the area to have them be aware of the patient. This also happens if a client steals a prescription block from a psychiatric healthcare organisation.

So I am curious. Is my view of the American patientfield skewed or is this really a major problem. It seems to me as if 1/20 patients is a pillshoppper

  On top of simply getting the pharmD I want to go into R&amp;D which at first I figured I could get away with not having any other degree than a B.S. in chemistry (which I am headed towards anyway) and the PharmD and a fellowship/residency in a particular area would do the rest. I have yet to work in a pharmacy but I've shadowed some doctors and I am pretty sure I don't want to go into that not to mention I don't feel my gpa/extracurriculars match what they are looking for. Pharmacy seemed to allow me the use of my brain

Sidenote: I am considering a dual degree in pharmacy school (an MBA or PhD).

tl;dr 
 I want to know what I need to do to start working in a pharmaceutical company's research or upper management positions?

2. When clinical positions become available, that seems to be the new trend. 

3. Raises don't even keep up with inflation anymore. 

4. Health benefits have been diminished practically every year. 

5. I'm in a state that is not passing the Medicaid expansion

My current options are:

A. Stick with current position and try to weather the storm.

1. I'm not eager to go out and get a Pharm.D. on top of my law degree

2. Please tell me about any experiences you have had with pharmacy lawyers/law in general.  

3. Now I know that ""pharmacy law"" is quite broad; there's everything from pharmaceutical patent lawyers to tort litigators. I'm particularly interested in taking a counsel/consultant/legal compliance role for a firm or insurance company. What do you think? Is there a particular sub-field in pharmacy (e.g. pandemic drugs [excuse my ignorance]) that you think is going to be hot in a few years and will have high demand for lawyers?

I'm currently on a general medicine rotation and its not at all what I expected. I'm thinking about sitting down with my preceptor about it but I just wanted to make sure that my expectations are not atypical.

Basically I come into the pharmacy and I work up a whole floor of patients. By working up I mean, electrolytes if warranted, microbiology), check their chart to see if they are improving on therapy and if therapy is still appropriate, go through and make sure relevant labs have been ordered, finally I find out how well they are eating for IV to PO conversion. After I'm done with that (2-3.5 hours depending on census) I just work on projects (usually case presentations) until the clinical pharmacist comes back and we take 20 minutes to go over my patients. Then I either go back to projects or if I'm lucky I get to counsel a patient on warfarin. Recently, I was given a new project where I just determine whether an ADR occurred based on drug therapies ordered. 

I was kind of expecting to go on rounds and make suggestions on therapy in an interdisciplinary team. I don't know have some interaction with doctors other than ""I need that chart.""

I guess what I'm getting at is I don't get how what I'm doing now differs from what I would do on a hospital rotation, etc).

Feedback Desired!,PharTicaWhaaa,17,10,24,"TL;DR - We have designed a Windows based application called PharTiculate to help people in the Pharmaceutical Industry learn how to pronounce drug names and get basic drug information to educate and improve credibility.

Hey Guys and Gals of /r/Pharmacy!

My name is Brad and am a long time Redditor. On behalf of my newly formed business partner Deidre, PharTiculate was born. In a nutshell, PharTiculate lets the user search a list of either Generic or Brand Name Drugs and view basic information about it in a flashcard format. Besides being a shameless plug to spread word of mouth about PharTicualte, we decided that what better way to get good honest feedback than to reach out to the Reddit community which made this kind of feedback famous on the internet. Our intention is to make PharTiculate as good and polished as it can be.

More information and a downloadable demo can be found at http://www.pharticulate.com. We would appreciate any positive as well as negative feedback that you guys might like to provide with no obligation to purchase any licenses at all. If you believe we are on to something and might like to purchase a license believing it may be of benefit to you

1358643067.0,16wkkv,Pharmacists and techs! Are these patterns prevalent with Suboxone users in your area?,Scyphex,15,10,18,"I am simply trying to determine if these are general issues other people have had to deal with in the pharmacy

I am a tech with almost 2 years of experience. I worked in a retail setting for a while and then moved away to a different school for a year. I came back and got my old job back, and suddenly, it appears that 30-40% of the cusotmer base is getting it.

I live in an area that deals with prescription drug abuse frequently. However, and have always been right. This disturbs me.

In instance one, and stare at me. Now, when a customer asks what they have that is ready, I don't want to tell them they have Valtrex and Viagra when I don't know if the person standing next to them is a stranger or not. This happens around 80% of the time when someone is in line for Suboxone. No customer privacy whatsoever.

Calling. I would say the majority of calls I answer are about someone telling us to get their Suboxone ready. However, they tend to have others pick up the medication for them. Not only that, 50% of the time they are on the phone and make a damn drug deal right in front of me. However, as this is retail, the sale matters more, as I am told. I would estimate (where I live, anyways) that 2 out of the 30+ patients that receive this medicine are actually trying to break away from the substances they were originally addicted to. The rest make sales in front of me

I see these people several times a day. Now, and 2. Multiple times in one day. I should not see you on every shift I work, much less 2-3 times a shift.

They come in pairs - Since many tend to have no issue talking in front of the pharmacy, often leading me to believe that they have simply given money to pick up the suboxone from the other person.

They know the price of their medication and tend to have exact change. It is understandable since they are here, rolled up in electrical tape and such gets suspicious. This isn't something I am bitching about, it is just another thing on the list of common things I see. Even the customers that are clockwork, knowing what day they are out of X drug dont come in with exact change. Something about suboxone always ends up without having to break a bill. Always exact change, everytime.

I'm not looking down on anyone here. I am merely wanting to know if other places outside of this region (SWVA) deal with the exact same thing, why they have exact change, why I see them several times a day (I dont want to assume dealing, but hey, I see it often in this field) and why they call so frequently, and are in the parking lot when they call. I don't know exactly how this stuff affects people, but I can easily state that I don't see this with people on other substances that I deal with on a day to day basis. I don't want to continue asking why

I was wondering how / if labor laws pertain to retail pharmacists in the sense that they can only work a 40 hour + overtime(unless salary contracted) work week

My girlfriend is a salaried FT pharmer and works at a large retail pharmacy (DR, one of those) and she works 10 hour shifts (Scheduled) but stays for 12-14 a day sometimes, with **no time for lunch / bathroom breaks.** Now as a normal person who works a 9-5(6 or 7) job, I can't wrap my head around the fact that she works this much and doesn't even get a 5 minute break to do personal business or even eat a fucking snack, it's really frustrating hearing that she doesn't have the time to maintain her own health during work hours.

I've been looking around on the web and while there's an abundance of ""How to become x doctor"" websites, which is what I was interested in because I think I'd enjoy doing research.

Is it feasible to get a PharmD and perhaps some fellowship training and then work on a PhD while I'm in the workforce? Or should I be looking at schools where I can get them both done in the same go.

Morphine is used for treating moderate to severe acute or chronic pain (i.e. it is an analgesic). One of its more serious side-effects is respiratory depression. Its severity can be judged by the degree of sedation (i.e. depression of a patient's awareness to the environment and reduction in their responsiveness to external stimulation). Almost all of a dose of morphine, acting via a similar mechanism to morphine.

(a)
The Australian Medicines Handbook (AMH) advises to “Avoid use in severe hepatic impairment; may cause excessive sedation or coma.” What might be the reason for the excessive sedation from morphine in patients with severe impairment of liver function?

(b)
The AMH also advises that morphine may cause excessive sedation and delirium in patients with renal impairment. Explain why there might be a greater risk of these side-effects in such patients.

I started as a technician and got my training and license by working for CVS near the campus of a major US pharmacy school where I was an undergrad student with hopes of getting into pharmacy school and becoming a pharmacist. After 6 months my license was upgraded from tech-in-training to regular tech and I studied hard for the national tech certification. Because of financial troubles (I made what highschoolers who put fries in a box at McDonalds make) along with my parents' declining health I had to go home for a while.

I continued to work for CVS but after some typical CVS shenanigans I began working at a small local grocery store chain.

My boss seemed like a really nice guy. He hired me on the spot and gave me a $3/hr payraise over CVS and it was only two minutes from my house. I worked as many hours as possible in a couple locations around town including 1 weekend shift/week at a location an hour away because they needed the help. I was putting in over 50 hours a week for 6 months straight. During that time I had some health issues but nothing too serious that would require me to miss work or perform poorly. I had broken tooth that would have been too much for me to pay out of pocket to fix

I spent all day helping people in the community bill their controlled substances to the government from doctors who were under investigation by the DEA

After 6 months I was contacted by someone in the company who wanted to talk to me about my options for limited health insurance coverage that I would have to pay for myself at a very high monthly cost that was out of my ability to pay

I was pretty angry, I was putting in over 50 hours a week. I called him up and asked him if I was full time or part time. He assured me I was full time.

I knew where the employee files were kept so the next time he was gone and we had a floater pharmacist I took a peak at mine, 'employee switched to part time' dated with his signature next to it. He knew I was working under the idea that I was full time and putting off my own care until I would get insurance, which he knew that I wouldn't be able to get. 

Also in the file was my 3 month review which stated that I was a great employee with a professional demeanor that was a great addition to their team

During my time there, xanax, and valium.

Customers would come in with prescriptions for these sorts of drugs and have the gall to tell me that CVS down the street wouldn't fill it for them because it was too early

I learned about the national database that these sorts of purchases were reported to and learned that we can look up patient prescriptions. I told my concerns to the pharmacist at the store an hour away that I worked 1 shift a week at. I began, which drugs. We are talking about obscene amounts. Sometimes I saw these patients making drug deals in the parking lot after leaving our store.

Word came down from the pharmacy head of all stores that I was to stop doing this. I never betrayed patient confidentiality, or help local dealers fill their inventory. I did as I was told though and just did my job to the letter and kept my head down.

Rather than cause a stink

I gave 1 month notice and worked up to my last day as a professional and left on good terms. I never confronted my boss about lying to my face about the full time/insurance issue.

When I got back to school I started working at the new location. The store manager that had promised me full time and benefits wouldn't let me fill scripts, etc, as it was a small pharmacy and he wanted to do all the patient interaction himself. He instead scheduled me for 10 hours a week driving a hatchback gremlin delivering meds to patients out in the boonies. I talked to him about the promise he made, the whole reason I had relocated in the first place, and he said he couldn't do anything for me. Unable to sign a lease or afford a place to stay with only a 10 hour a week job, I was forced to quit and without notice, as I couldn't even find a place to stay while I did another two weeks.

My file now says quit without notice.

I abandoned pharmacy altogether and now work as an EMT. I deal with heart attacks, etc.

I still don't get health insurance. I haven't been to a doctor, many years. I can't afford to finish school still. I'm extremely bitter about health care in America, and really peeved about how things ended in my pharmacy job. My license has expired naturally and I haven't renewed it.

I love medicine

Are there any career paths in medicine that I can pursue that will allow for a decent lifestyle

Sorry to rant. I just miss working in pharmacy and feel really nostalgic today.

Advice?,PharmDvsTRex,17,12,27,"I work for a major chain in California. I float from store to store. Here are a few things that make me quite uncomfortable

1) California law mandates that if there is only one pharmacist on duty then there may only be one technician. There may be as many clerks as the rph feels comfortable with, type scripts, and accept refills. Now in this chain I constantly see two techs per pharmacist. One of those techs should be working as a ""clerk,"" doing nothing but clerk duties in order for it to be legal. But both the techs do tech work (ie filling scripts, restocking drugs, etc).  An inspection by the board could land me fine if I'm the rph on duty at the time. 

2) California requires mandatory counseling on ALL new scripts, but it is dangerous! As an intern I've learned that patients don't know shit about their drugs or their side effects. It's important they talk with a pharmacist. 

I'll leave it at two. These are the things that bug me the most though there are a few other things that strike the wrong chord. 

Once I am working as a pharmacist I will demand any tech I work with to follow the laws. If they don't I'll report them. If I'm a manager I'll write them up. If corporate doesn't do anything to remedy the situation I'll report the pharmacy to the board.  This makes me seem like a bitch

*tl;dr* I know counseling takes a lot of time, and are usually understaffed, but I don't think that is sufficient reason to blatantly ignore the law. People are going to hate me.

I am not really getting the kind of pain relief from the Difenac that I was getting from the Robax Platinum and I think it may be because the methocarbamol was helping with the muscle spasms.

I'm uncertain whether other countries have tiered healthcare in senses similar to the way we do



I find the insurance co. driven healthcare system in the US discomfiting



The instance that comes to mind was about a dad under Caterpillar insurance, numerous families have gotten quite skilled at trying to understand the exact niche that their insurance co. has placed them.  That being said, I don’t believe this is reason enough for us to abandon our father figure example either.  Let's look on.



The Caterpillar example has a few variables to it, and unfortunately none of the preferred local options, which would have charged nothing through his policy, had enough to fill the prescription.  I am aware that the promotion systems are continuously engaged in our healthcare system, but the act of penalizing a man for trying to work with a system that may have benefited him more based on proximity or whatever variables he normally manipulated is clearly hurtful to the patient, and seems blatantly driven by company politics.


My pharmacist



It might not seem like much to make a few phone calls, and questions, vaccinations, and some biochemical analyses, as well as the traditional role of monitoring indications and contraindications for our customers, placating a customer to this degree isn't feasible. It especially reeks of yesterday's fish when everybody is painfully aware that the big pink elephant, representing insurance companies' mentality of “our politics first and our customers' health second



TLDR: Anecdotal evidence shows US insurance companies' disinterest in their customers' health being the cornerstone for their policies.   Pharmacists literally work to manipulate any variables they can to maintain their customers’ health at reasonable costs



So my questions for the rest of the pharmacy world are:



How does your government handle healthcare, and what do you think is completely detrimental?

The first two years of school I had lack of motivation to pursue my studies seriously. I wasn't going out every night or even indulging in bad behavior but rather my mind was never at the task at hand.  In my non science/math classes I got mainly all B's but for everything else I did even worse. Got Cs in general biology, i retook and got a C. Also when it was time for me to take orgo 2 i withdrew from the course (keeping the lab I got a C) and even got a D in microeconomics. After these two years I took a hard look at my life and the road it was headed towards and decided to make a change but  I'm afraid it's still too late.

 I received a 2.5 GPA after those 2 years and that following summer enrolled in Physics 1 at my local community college (due to the classes being significantly cheaper as opposed to my 4 year) and got a B. The following semester I got a 3.2 gpa (last fall) and that includes a B in Anatomy and Physiology 1 ultimately raising my gpa to a 2.72 . As of now I'm taking other classes required for my Public Health major which are going ok


My current plan is to enroll into orgo 2 this summer at my local community college (again due to cost) but doing well next year in both gen chem 2, getting Bs in my more recent science courses is not going to be good enough with my horrible academic record. I plan on  prepping very hard for the pcat and working at a pharmacy as a technician, but I don't know if this will suffice. When I think about it, by the time I'll graduate with my improved recent grades, I'll still barley meet the bare requirements for the 2.5 min prerequisite gpa that most schools require since I did so bad initially.

In the first half of the course, IBW, etc. The professor who covered these topics provided the class with the formulas on the final exam and most people did well as far as I understand. She didn't see a point in forcing us to memorize all of the various formulas, molecular weights, sodium chloride equivalents (E values for calculations isotonicity) and the like.

However

I'm perfectly fine with learning whatever is asked of me, the majority of my classmates will likely end up in retail/community pharmacy and stay there for the extent of their careers.

What I want to know is how often any of you retail/community pharmacists actually use these things. How often do you calculate mEq or perform other calculations involving molecular weight

While I'm not the typical young person who likes to mindlessly claim we can just look up formulas, etc. in books or our phone when we need to, I have to think it's an option utilized by many pharmacists.

I am in the process of deciding what I should do for my last ""free"" summer before pharmacy school. I apologize for the long post in advance: 

[B]Option 1: [/B]
I was just presented with an opportunity to intern with a company called 'Southwestern Advantage.' They sell educational supplies including textbook study aids and software. Essentially, my manager, and 3 other student interns. 
     I've looked at the products, and this is not a scam. The catch is that it takes a lot of work to sell the supplies; I must visit 30 families 6 days a week. 
[U]Advantages: [/U]
- character building (leadership, exposure to working in new locations, improving work ethic and commitment) 
- college credit
- experience
- money
- possibly once in a lifetime opportunity 
In addition
[U]Disadvantages: [/U]
- working about 80 hours a week
- stress
- accepting rejection
- pay based on my effort 


[B]Option 2: [/B]
At the same time

My alternative plans for summer would be to work part-time, and to really do new things that I've never really had time to do as an undergrad.

So again
1) Enjoy my last 'free' summer by traveling
OR 
2) work my butt off through the entire summer with this internship that can most likely pay me above 8 grand? 

Do any of you have advice on what I should do? Is this really my last relaxing summer before pharmacy school? Would this program heighten my experience and personal character? If you have any other questions about the program or what I’d be doing over the summer in detail

1376285456.0,1k6v3y,Should I quit my job?,throwaway__meow,4,1,6,"I've exhausted my brain from thinking about this... issue and would just like some insight/potential advice.

I'm currently a student on the pre-pharmacy track, and past mentors for recommendation letters about 1-2 months ago. One of the people I asked was my manager at my part-time job that was my first big exposure to retail pharmacy, but the response was quite disappointing. Instead of treating it as a personal recommendation, the manager first stated that corporate may have an issue with it and basically pushed it off for 3-4 weeks. Granted, I could have been more aggressive, but that point I took the behavior as a negative sign and looked for other references.

Some background on the job: It was only in my third year at university that I seriously decided to pursue pharmacy and looked for more opportunities for a place to learn. I volunteered and applied to a bunch of pharmacies in the area, and really put my heart into doing my best. I made my fair share of errors though, mostly because I had trouble the first few weeks since there was no guidance and the store was quite busy (making it hard to ask for and receive guidance :/). I've definitely had my slip-ups, but it's frequently commented on (by that same manager) that I'm hardworking, helpful, friendly, calm, and willing to learn.

I thoroughly enjoy this job, but I am still a bit bothered by the manager's behavior. I know that it's up to a supervisor's discretion (or anyone's discretion, really) whether or not they want to write the recommendation, but the way they went about it seems a bit off in my books. Why did I not receive a straight, honest answer if it was obvious and stated explicitly (many times) that this was a time-sensitive case? Even after it was ok'd by the higher ups, more conditions were put on the quality of my work and there have been so many mixed signals regarding a simple letter of recommendation even up to this day. (Personally, I am not adding them as a reference simply because I don't want my application to have any weaknesses that I can consciously avoid). I have only been working for half a year, I've made my fair share of mistakes but I've also done my best to maintain quality in my work.

Should I be looking for a new job with less hours and possibly a manager who is more confident in my skills? I'm not sure how things will work out in the future, but at the end of the day, I do wonder why should I put so much time and effort into the job when I can't even get a recommendation out of it. Is this a huge red flag? Should I just ride it out for the rest of this academic year and look into a new location later on down the road? Or is it time to look for new opportunities?
