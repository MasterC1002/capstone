1358350030.0,16ortk,Follow-up: Broadening my narrow anti-gun view,jellatin,6230,3104,1179,"**Edit:** [inspectormac's follow-up](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/16ortk/followup_broadening_my_narrow_antigun_view/c7yf1jj)

[Original thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/1503uf/broadening_my_narrow_antigun_view/)

Some people expressed an interest in reading about a member of gunnit taking me out shooting for the first time.  

[Inspectormac](http://www.reddit.com/u/inspectormac) offered to take me shooting and give me some experience handling various guns

Well not much, this guy likes guns.  **Really** likes guns.  In fact I don’t think there are any posts in here not in /r/guns.  Inspectormac offered to meet in the middle of where we live and drive down to the range since it was further from my place, I declined, but not because I was afraid he was going to shoot me.  Well, mostly not for that reason.

He took me to a range with several different sub-ranges for different types of shooting.  When I arrived, but it was still a relief to know.  We also went over the four safety rules from the sidebar that he asked me to know before arriving.

After stepping into the range itself, what looked like a guy teaching his girlfriend how to shoot, two older guys smiling and swapping stories.  The crowd looked more like they were going for a relaxing day of fishing than firing guns, but it helped drive home that this is a hobby like any other.   

After an intro into basic gun handling and mechanics and setting up our target, no distracting firing noise, and generally pretty entertaining to try and hit a target with.  This was followed up with two handguns, a Ruger SP-101 .22lr revolver, and a Ruger MK2 Target .22lr semi-automatic pistol.  While they had a somewhat threatening look to them, both were very easy to shoot and entertaining to work with as well.  I found I didn’t have to be distracted with worrying about recoil and got to focus on aiming.

This changed as we got to the bigger guns.  The first gun I shot that was really in the size and shape that I was expecting was a CZ-75b 9mm pistol.  This is the kind of gun I imagine everyone carrying with them on a daily basis and what I had the most interest in getting some exposure to.  The gun was heavier than I expected, nothing bad could come of it.

The main thing that struck me when shooting the CZ-75b was that hitting a the target where I wanted it was *hard*.  When Inspectormac placed the target at the first berm (10 yds, my aim was not so impressive.  Besides being humorous, it did really illustrate Inspectormac’s point that they are for self-defense, and in most self-defense scenarios your target will be in the 3-10 yd range.  If they’re not, they’re probably not a major threat.

I went on to shoot a Ruger Security 6, and a Springfield Armory XD9, 9mm striker fired pistol (Inspectormac’s carry gun which he graciously retrieved from his car for me to shoot).  The revolver was interesting, but like the CZ-75b, I spent so much time focusing on my grip, preparing for the recoil, and the number of shots that I had fired, the XD9 was shockingly light compared to the CZ-75b

Throughout the day we discussed various topics, to ammunition and history of the guns, mechanical (double action, single action, firing pin, etc) and a little bit of the political side of the issue.  I got to walk around and see the different types of ranges and activities that go on there as well.

I would call the day a definite success.  First and foremost (for me) I don’t hold an irrational fear of a gun being dropped and misfiring.  All the weapons I shot took conscious, while I did find the recoil on the larger guns substantial, I never felt like I was going to lose my hold on them.

The next important thing that set in was that hitting anything beyond 10 yards is somewhat difficult

One thing that struck me in talked to Inspectormac was that while walking around with his carry-gun

The last really important thing I learned was what ""semi-automatic"" actually means.  It's a lot harder to get caught up in the fervor of *banning semi-automatic weapons* when you actually know what it means.

In short, whereas before I thought it was outdated.  

Thanks again to Inspectormac for taking me out, he focused 100% on helping me, didn’t shoot at all) to educate me.  He is a great ambassador for your hobby (he even got me to say magazine instead of clip!).  And thanks to all the members of gunnit who offered advice, opinions, and recommendations in my original thread.

School says kids' anxiety went down and kids said they felt safer with the dads there.

Since, extra playground monitors, door watching to make sure the doors are locked from the outside that should be, stuff like that.

So now we have a program officially in place where dads can sign up for shifts and positions in the school on their days off and stuff. the school says that since this has started, no one's fighting in the halls, and when they sit with the kids that sit alone at lunch, other kids come and sit and the quiet kids are now participating in class way more.

As a gun owner
And you do not *ever* run around pretending to be the police while carrying a gun because then
You do not start shit, roll your eyes, talk shit, or even raise your voice. *To anyone.* **Ever.**

A combat instructor (who happened to be Buddhist and a Marine) once said to me: ""From now on
""You do all this because if you are the one to start a fight, you're going to pull it and kill him. And even if you don't go to jail because you could convince the jury that it was self-defense, you're going to have to live with the fact that you could have saved someone's life and yet you let your ego kill someone.""
""You are not the police, the continuum of force policy, or a union plus free lawyers protecting you if you screw up.""

ed: He also said: ""but after backing down and trying to apologize, call the police, give a statement, go home, and sleep like a baby. You did all you could for your attacker, and he was the one that made the final decision...

... to kill himself.""

Cross-post aside; make sure you take the responsibility of carrying a weapon seriously. All of our rights depend on it. DO NOT give chances to people when your life is in danger

1375574717.0,1jnj4u,Lessons Learned from Shooting at Police Officers (with Simunition),campussim,2669,814,730,"I got the opportunity to participate in police training exercises through my campus marksmanship club

**What We Did:**
We did a variety of realistic exercises

* Hostage situations
* Clearing a building with multiple active shooters
* Traffic stops

The volunteers from our marksmanship club were the bad guys, except that they shoot marking pellets and won't chamber real ammunition. Shooting Simunition feels like shooting a 22. There's very little recoil. It's loud enough to where it gets your attention even though no hearing protection is needed (unlike a 22, where you should still wear hearing protection). Imagine a large man with big hands clapping his hands together about two feet from your face. I found a pretty good video of Simunition here (skip to 3:15 if you just want to see it shot): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C2lwo-VjPE

So without further ado


**1. COPS DON'T KNOW THE LAW.**

Almost every time we did a traffic stop, unload it, run the serial number, and ask us if it was registered. They even arrested one of us for simply having it. In my state there is no gun registration, and it's perfectly legal for anyone to have a loaded gun in his car without a permit. Seizing the gun and running the serial is improper unless there is probable cause to believe it's illegal or stolen, et cetera. We didn't get the chance to explain any of this, because the cops became extremely aggressive and on-edge the moment they knew we were armed.

*Take-home point:* Know the law, but let them go on doing it. Your lawyer can sort out an illegal search and seizure later, but a resisting-arrest charge is harder to deal with. 

**2. SHOOTING UNDER STRESS IS NOTHING LIKE RANGE SHOOTING**

Simunition *hurts.* It will make you bleed if it hits you in the right spot

* Your hands will shake like mad. My front sight was bobbling far more than normal. When I went to change magazines
* You probably won't see your sights. During one traffic stop, and my gun was pretty well concealed at 4 o'clock in my IWB holster (Crossbreed Supertuck Deluxe). Ten feet to my left, an officer is going through the passenger's pockets and has just spun around to where he can't see me. Ten feet in front of me is an officer who's facing my direction but is distracted, reading the details of my fake driver's license into his radio. I've been told to start shooting if I see an opportunity, and I see it. Time slows down, I agonize for what seems like a minute but what is actually two or three seconds over whether I'm going to do it. Then I do it, there's no looking back, lift my shirt, keeping my isoceles
* Moving helps. Those who moved, did. 
* Capacity matters. When my hands were shaking and I had tunnel vision and I was confronted with an opponent, keep shooting until I couldn't shoot any more. I remember reading that when multiple police officers fire at one suspect they use something like 5 times more rounds per officer than one officer does shooting alone at one suspect. The sound coming from their fellow officer's guns freaks them out even more, they can't process it in the heat of the moment, they don't know what's going on, they just shoot and shoot until the threat is ended. That's pretty much how I felt.

*Take-home point:* If you think standing at the range and shooting at a stationary paper target is going to prepare you to defend yourself, but that alone will not help you survive a self-defense scenario. I'm no great fan of James Yeager, but he did say something that now strikes me as very true: In a stressful situation, you won't default to your highest level of training, you'll default to whatever level you've totally mastered as muscle memory. Participate in exercises like this if you can, take courses that teach defensive shooting and put you in actually stressful scenarios.

**3. COPS DON'T SHOOT WELL.**

As I mentioned before

*Take-home point:* Support your local police force. Volunteer for events like this. If they are spending their budget responsibly but still don't have the money to train their officers properly

Carrying a gun does not make you a righteous bastion of moral purity. It does not make you badder, and morally, that's all it does. 

The gun is not a license to go to dangerous places, just because you might have a better chance to survive them. You should still use caution and maintain situational awareness to avoid violence. You should back down from the swaggering bravado of other men and act more timidly and kindly than your caveman instincts would normally encourage you to. Rather than carrying a gun through the bad part of town at 3am, it's better to structure your day so that a trip through the bad part of town at 3am is not on the agenda. 

Zimmerman was legally justified to shoot Martin at the moment he took the shot, and society as a whole would've been better served if Zimmerman had not followed Martin, or at least had not followed Martin as long as he did. 

Now, he paid for his masculine pride with his life. 

If you're going to carry a gun, and practiced. Carry safely in a holster. Carry jacketed hollow point ammunition. And do *not* treat the gun as a license to be stupid. Carrying a gun means the opposite: it means you have a duty to be cautious and to be smart.",MOD APPROVED,False,,t5_2qhc8,1373843647.0,,

You're special and unique and your mommy loves you very much and if you just applied yourself I'm sure you'd go real far (as if that's somehow a compliment). But guns are guns and your performance is pretty well independent of the platform you're using

So these are the guns you should buy

(Yeah, but what the hell, call it 100 for the internet. I'm not writing for you, and newbie here should make purchases he'll use to learn things instead of following in your illustrious footsteps.)

**FIRST GUN:** First we're going to put on our big boy pants and go to the local Wal-Mart and get us a Ruger 10/22. There's nothing wrong with most other .22 rifles, you're gonna walk out with some random WASR or something, because you're too dumb to do your research beforehand and are asking strangers of unknown wisdom on the internet what to buy. 

You're all Appleseeded up and you're super cool and now you want a

**HANDGUN:** Glock 19. No. I don't care that the M&amp;P fits your hand better or that the SR9 is cheaper. Shut the fuck up. You're asking vapid entry-level questions on the internet. Get the Glock. Not a 1911, not an overpriced goddamn HK that's gonna turn you into Tom Cruise from Collateral. Glock 19.

The communist zombie 1% martian UN muslim Obama Axe body spray troops are invading and you need a

**RIFLE:** [Spike's Tactical](http://www.spikestactical.com/new/z/st15-16-midlength-le-carbine-p-443.html) AR-15. Play fucking legos with it. Go nuts. Throw red dots and lasers and a vertical goddamn frontpenis on there. It'll make you tacticooler and you wouldn't listen to my real advice (which is to leave it bone-stock and add accessories as necessary to address real shortcomings you experience on the range rather than perceived problems invented by marketers) anyway.

Yeah

**SHOTGUN:** [Mossberg 590](http://www.mossberg.com/product/shotguns-pump-action-590-special-purpose-special-purpose-9-shot/50645). Mossberg 500s are fine but those listed on their web site are either all tacticool or designed for Elmer Fudd to shoot gooses and shit. God damn. Just spend some reasonable fucking money on a black-furniture-having shotgun that's short enough for your hallway, I will laugh at you as soon as you leave.

Now take some blurry pictures of your special and exciting new ""family

I also brought up the fact that should an incident like this happen, and nothing more. They are as dangerous as the people who own them.

**EDIT 2: Thanks for someone, looking for more information on me.**

We are all aware that reddit is a community, who look to cause you harm, and reddit is far from immune to these people. We expect a certain level of anonymity, the rules of the community support this, and as we know, people will break this rule.

reddit is a very ""liberal"" community, and hopefully educate them in what this community is about. This kindness, goodwill, and education, can be seen be viewing the [second highest scoring](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/16ortk/followup_broadening_my_narrow_antigun_view/) post on /r/guns. Though, having only a few hundred subscribers between several subs, none of these legitimate anti-gun subs are popular. 

We do have anti-gun subs on reddit that have a small following. However, and direct others to the post to belittle, mock, and cause problems for the OP. Most of the people they target, are not frequent posters to the gun subs, but want to share something with the community. Not only do they attempt to manipulate, and brigade votes, belittle, color

They post screen shots from different subs of anyone who brings up guns in a good light, to do the same as they do with the pictures. 

They RES tag just about every one they can, they will downvote you, and comment on your post about you being a gun owner. 

They keep categorized list with hundreds of pro-gun posts that they don't like, sometimes in subs, or posts, that have nothing to do with guns.

Where it does get very personal, facebook, phone number, location, etc...) of another user, or anyone really. They have done this to several members of the community, for things such as posting a youtube video

Not only that

It goes as far as them contacting, state PD, the ATF, and FBI, to investigate legal gun owners, and proprietors on /r/guns, and reddit as a whole. They will lie to these agencies

The admins have been contacted over, rule breakers, take jabs at us. And, as gun owners, we are some of the most upstanding, and law abiding members of the community, and we will just keep our chins up.

The reddit community is supposed to be a safe community. And as many of us who carry guns know

So please, or video, if it is not yourself. Please, do not even try to vaguely threaten, or try to argue with these people, as that is what they want. They want nothing more than to try to catch you fuck up. 

Be safe

TL;DR: reddit is not anonymous, to cause emotion, and elicit a response from you, causing a not so good/safe reddit experience. Please be safe, and be aware that this can happen to you.

Good evening:
 
This is to let you know we received your text message. We are preparing the two documents for your review and signature:
1)      the lawsuit designed to strike down the bill the Governor signed into law last Tuesday unless he can show there was a true emergency to warrant the waiver of the 3-day rule, which reads,  “No bill shall be passed or become a law unless it shall have been printed and upon the desks of the members, in its final form, at least three calendar legislative days prior to its final passage, unless the governor, or the acting governor, under his or her hand and the seal of the state, given the language of the bill itself

2)      The Petition that will be served on every member of the state legislature and the Governor instructing them to comply with Article XII of the State Constitution, “A well-regulated militia is essential to the security of a free state ….” The Legislature has failed to provide for the discharge of the obligation of all persons in the state to defend the state and nation through an organized militia, well-armed, well-regulated, well-trained and well-disciplined, to which all able bodied men and women belong. As the enforcers of the State Constitution we need to Petition the Governor and every member of the State Legislature to act to begin to bring the state into compliance with the State and Federal Constitutions by restoring the state militia. 

 
I expect to send the documents with instructions within a day or so.

We will reach every rep.

We will overwhelm them.

We will be victorious.

(Courtesy of the fine people over at Ruger) - Clicking this link will bring you to a pre-typed letter that will be messaged to ALL of your reps. Send it two or three times a day until further notice.

http://www.ruger.com/micros/advocacy/takeAction.html

**Phone:**

The bill will first be introduced into the Senate and the Democratic Senate Majority leader has already been hard pressed to allow a vote on this issue. **Call him first and let him know your opinion: Harry Reid (D-NV) (202) 224-3542**

As /u/Deradius bravely put it

&gt;Reid is paying close attention to what will happen in the Senate. If he doesn't think he can get 60 votes

**We also have a few swing seats that will be up for reelection soon and this issue could cause them to lose their seats. Let's let them know that.**

Senate Swing Votes Who Are Up For Re-election in 2014:

Max Baucus (D-MT) (202) 224-2651

Mark Begich (D-AK) (202) 224-3004

Susan M. Collins (R-ME) (202) 224-2523

Kay R. Hagan (D-NC) (202) 224-6342

Tim Johnson (D-SD) (202) 224-5842

Mary L. Landrieu (D-LA) (202) 224-5824

Mark L. Pryor (D-AR) (202) 224-2353

Mark Udall (D-CO) (202) 224-5941

Tom Udall (D-NM) (202) 224-6621

Mark R. Warner (D-VA) (202) 224-2023

After you have called those above you should call your representatives and tell them to OPPOSE the assault weapons band and to not compromise on any further gun legislation.

I think we should come up with our own hashtag and message and set up a similar system. What do you think?

Among other things I expect we will be seeing more traffic from gun control advocates wanting to discuss these issues. I personally feel it's to early to discuss such things and its also unlikely to change the opinions of “us” or “them” I do think it provides a good stage for those who may not have made up their mind on these issues to see the debate and make a decision based on facts.

As such I would urge you as you have these discussions

I am sure some discussions will get heated (they already have) just try to remember we represent the gun owners of reddit and how we act will play a role in either solidifying or breaking stereotypes.

All that being said

I welcome comments on this.

Stay safe my friends.

1333039694.0,rjg51,My (so far) 100% winning anti-gun control argument. ,,2474,1212,1522,"This is not particularly complicated and perhaps others use it.  I went to a VERY liberal graduate school.  I am not a drinker, came up I would simply say this statement:

""You seem like a fair minded person.  You don't like guns.  I don't like alcohol.  If you can tell me one argument for banning guns that does not apply equally to banning alcohol

Some of the usual attempts were: 

""Guns kill people.""  Response:  Alcohol kills more people.

""Yeah

""But guns are used in terrible murders.  Alcohol only causes accidents or health-related deaths.""  Response:  This is an even stronger argument for banning alcohol.  If you banned guns, unlike murder).  

""They tried to ban booze and it didn't work.""  Response:  Try to ban guns in the USA.  You see what happens.  No country with hundreds of millions of firearms in circulation and porous borders has ever successfully banned guns (or anything for that matter: see war on drugs.)

""But drinking is fun and a social activity.""  Response: Let's go shooting on Saturday.  Empty a few mags from an AK-47 and then tell me it's not fun.

And so I took some of the more open-minded ones shooting.  They had a great time and several of them are now gun owners. 

Nobody has yet given me a reason to ban guns that didn't apply with equal or greater force to booze.  

**Edit:**  I probably should have called this an anti gun-ban argument rather than an anti gun-control argument.  I'm not trying to advocate any policy in the real world based on this. I was just trying to explain to people -- many of whom had never even met a pro-gun person -- how anti-gun views were more of a matter of opinion than of some cut and dried logic.

I got an email for a ""Community Committee Against Gun Violence Meeting"" in my area, really.**) So I thought at the very least I could troll the group of 40 RSVP'd folks. Show up and there are 200 people packed into this church cafeteria. They talked for an hour about how to most effectively reach/influence your legislators, and everyone there *hand-wrote a letter* to a Colorado legislator. Many sad stories were told, and one of the Columbine victims' fathers was in attendance. Then there was a Q&amp;A, and a Registered Nurse (who treated one of the Aurora victims!) took the microphone to warn people about invading Patient Privacy. Then the only other person there under 50 spoke about Johns Hopkins research on mental health. 

I warned them as a medical student about the unintended consequence of driving people underground, but I forgot!  Facepalm!

Their official goals

* Reinstate stricter AWB &amp; mag caps  
* Background Checks for Private Sales  
* ""Something"" about Mental Health (yes
* [Assault Weapons Literature](http://imgur.com/zeriT)

Insider insight:

* They've wised up about the toxicity of the term ""Gun Control"" and have substituted the phrase ""Stopping Gun Violence."" 
*  The lady running the show knows the tricks: private sales
* Claims that the NRA is promulgating myths like ""More Deaths from Fists and Hammers"" (yes
* I asked the room how many had ever operated a firearm - **probably 70% had used a gun!** That surprised me. We always rail against the anti's as ""ignorant people who've probably never fired a gun"" but that's incorrect.  
* I asked the room how many have ever fired an AR-pattern rifle.  About 9 raised their hands (to audible gasps). 
* They are submitting bills to counter all the pro-gun progresses made

The good/bad news:  

* We are fighting little old ladies and moms. Who have plenty of free time to hound legislators with letters and phone calls and meetings.  
* People honestly are afraid of ""black guns"" and scary components.  
* Our opposition knows they're splintered and terribly organized. The grabbers know they face a mighty foe with the NRA. 

Final thoughts: don't bother using facts. You must appeal to emotion.  And do be nice

I did a post about this store called [You think you had a bad day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1ejoer/you_think_you_had_a_bad_day/) Anyways

**First Experiences**

Before starting working where I work now, weapons, etc. I was nervous as all get out to work behind the gun counter. One of the people training me, laid some ground rules about handling firearms that should always be followed. These rules are:

* 1) The weapon is always loaded.
* 2) Even when you know the weapon is unloaded. It's always loaded.
* 3) Always point the weapon at a safe direction. Never at someone. See rules 1 and 2 for why.
* 4) When handing a weapon over to someone
* 5) When a weapon is handed to you
* 6) Never point a firearm at something that you don't intend to kill. There is no such thing as shooting to injure.
* 7) Finger is never on the trigger unless you are ready to kill whatever it is you are pointing at.

I also developed a habit of not walking in front of pointed weapon. People will take a weapon and look down the sights usually aiming at the back counter wall. I would wait to the side for them to raise or lower the weapon due to rules 1 and 2. Most people will drop sight line, etc to let me pass. Cool, no problem.

My first day behind the gun counter, locked the slide back, handed it to him and then he proceeded to let the slide forward and take aim to see how it fit in his hands. Problem? He was pointing it right at me. I moved to the side to get out of the line of ""fire"" and he followed me.

""Sir

""Why

""I don't care

""Stop being such a...""

At this point, breaks the guys grip and tells him to leave.

""Why do I have to leave?""

""Because you aren't being safe with the weapon. You need to leave now.""

""Fuck you. I want to see a manager.""

Fine. My coworker calls out a name. Down at the other end of the counter, the president looks at me asks if I did have a gun pointed at me. ""Yes sir."" Asked the customer if he did point the gun at me, ""Yeah, but it was unloaded."" The president looks at the guy and says matter of factly,""Get the fuck out of my store and don't come back.""

The guy started to cause a slight ruckus about it, we usually have a sheriff, police officer, constable, state police, or a federal agent in store. The president pointed out that right now the guy is trespassing and disturbing the public and that there's five officers looking at him, ready to take him out of the store and to downtown/jail if he doesn't leave now.

Officers were watching the scene unfold and were just waiting. I never seen so many different people from different agencies waiting to bust some jerk's ass.

""Fine! I'm never coming here again!"" The customer said.

""I know and I don't care

**Yes

So, and hands it to me. It felt... different. Heavier.

""Are you sure this is cleared?""

""Yeah

I rack the action and a shell goes flying out and hits the guy in the forehead. I follow the shell in flight

I rack it six more times.

Six more shells go flying out.

He is told to put the shells back in his car and we'll finish the trade when he comes back in. He also got a stern talking too by one of the mangers.

**I need a holster**

We sell anything an officer needs; duty gear, accessories for their weapons, badges, vehicle equipment, you name it, we have it or can get it. So a local officer comes in and needs a holster.

""We can help you with a holster. What weapon do you have?""

""I don't know.""

This happens more times than I feel comfortable with saying. If my sample size is any indication about other officers, and we tell him to clear the weapon, lock the slide back and bring it in and we can help him find a holster.

He comes back in with a weapon, someone notices that he has a full loaded magazine in the the weapon. He drops the slide, which chambers a round. The gun is now hot, live and ready to shoot. Someone mentions this to him as he slides the weapon into the wrong holster. The weapon is stuck.

Fuck us, drop the magazine, and keep the whole thing pointed down at the floor. I explained to the guy that we can try to take the weapon out, but it's gotta come off the floor and we have to take it our vault. For his safety and the safety of others, he's not allowed in there. I also tell him very politely how much of a dumb ass he is.

He's cool with this

So, grumbling, lots of WD-40, and talk about taking a saw to the holster. We finally got it free.

The next day

**I'm on the SWAT team**

People come in all sorts of different shapes and sizes. Sheriffs

This big fellow comes in and is looking for tactical gear for his SWAT rig/uniform. He has a purchase order from his department. He needs everything, thigh rig, chest holster, sling for the AR he has to get, new duty belt rig, the whole nine.

The problem? We didn't have anything that fit him.

We can measure for body armor as those are custom made. But the sheet measurements didn't go that big.

Pants? We didn't have anything close to his size. I had to take a measuring tape, I'm a size 30 waist. When these pants finally came in, myself and another guy got into each leg of the pants and had room for more people.

Of course, and would be up charged for the size, which, the department PO didn't take into account.

The horrible person in me was thinking that they were going to use him for tactical entry as a human shield. I also joked with some other coworkers that the department should order all his gear in red and when he does bust down the door

I joined the Army several years ago on the active duty side. I worked as a 35N and eventually went through the selection process. 2 years later I had my 18B. (Yes it took me two complete years or 23 months

During a recent national emergency, ...etc. So I said yes and a few days later I was in Louisiana. During the course of my stay, we were told by state that they wanted us to start collecting firearms we saw and turn them in. You know it's against the law, I know it's against the law. 

A certain Louisiana guard soldier and I got to talking. Neither he, under any circumstance help destroy the nation that we took an oath to protect. We took an Oath and planned to stick to it. We went to the commander and told him our stance and he agreed. At this point in time we started a group known as the Oath Keepers. Any soldier, LEO, Contractor can be an Oath Keeper. So, without further introduction, AMAA

EDIT 1: Quick overview of what an Oath Keeper believes.

You're being very vague. It means that if any of the following happens:

    Orders to disarm the American people.
    Orders to conduct warrantless searches of the American people.
    Orders to detain American citizens as “unlawful enemy combatants” or to subject them to military tribunal.
    Orders to impose martial law or a “state of emergency” on a state.
    Orders to invade and subjugate any state that asserts its sovereignty.
    Any order to blockade American cities
    Any order to force American citizens into any form of detention camps under any pretext.
    Orders to assist or support the use of any foreign troops on U.S. soil against the American people to “keep the peace” or to “maintain control.""
    Any orders to confiscate the property of the American people
    Any orders which infringe on the right of the people to free speech

That you will not only disobey said order, to prevent said order(s) from happening.

1334667770.0,se4mr,I will keep my gun,,1440,477,463,"I would like to have a moment of your time, I would like to introduce myself and explain to you why I think it’s a good idea for me to have a gun.

I work in software, western European country.

I will be the first to admit that I did not immigrate out of desperate need; I came here to make money. That’s fine

All that being said, chances are, you’ll have to pry it from my cold, dead hands.

A lot of you will now be wondering how those two completely different ideas are compatible - and I will try to explain it to you by addressing some of the most common arguments of those people seeking more restrictive gun control. We’ll start with the most obvious:

*Guns kill people.*

Nonsense. People kill people. Would you prefer I use a sword? This is born out of the false assumption that access to a gun means an easy way to kill many people all at once, the ones of the school shootings and crazed people shooting up youth camps, are the exception, not the rule. In the scope of things, you have a better chance of being struck by lightning than you do of being shot in a classroom. In the past 500 years, the murder rate has consistently decreased - not increased - and that is in the center of the age of gunpowder.

Additionally, and knives are about 10,000 times easier to get than a gun.

*We have too many guns in the hands of criminals.*

That’s absolutely true - but they got there through illegal means. Adding more laws on top of that won’t do a damned bit of good. We should try enforcing the ones that exist, I can assure you, I would have no problem getting a pistol on the black market for a couple of hundred euros.

*Criminals steal guns from private citizens.*

Some do

*Manufacturing more guns makes them easier for criminals to get.*

There are already enough guns in the world to arm us all to the teeth; it’s far beyond making a difference. If you stop manufacturing guns right now

*Owning a gun makes a person more likely to use it.*

That’s true; in the same sense that being punched in the face makes you more likely to lose a tooth.

*Private citizens don’t need guns - the Police should be responsible for the enforcement of law.*

I want to live in the world you live in; I really do. The problem is, the world isn’t operating normally. We don’t need to look as far as a failed state; consider Louisiana during Katrina, or Los Angeles during the riots.

I am not trying to malign Police. I am really glad that cops exist

No, for a very long time, you were legally required to aid law enforcement. De facto, it is our responsibility as citizens of a society to engage in its defense, against threats both internal and external.

There are other
Many areas lack timely police coverage.
Many areas have completely overworked police forces
Police officers are human beings
Police can’t predict crime.

*Assault rifles should be banned.*

You’re under the mistaken assumption that an assault rifle is the deadliest form of weapon

Shotguns are far deadlier than assault rifles in an urban setting, and they usually fire cartridges smaller than regular rifle cartridges, too. The vast majority of assault rifles can’t pierce body armor, but I can get around it with a shotgun, and I can blow straight through it with a sufficiently powerful single shot hunting rifle.

As for assault rifles being used in mass shootings? A handgun is about 10 times easier to keep hidden than an assault rifle

*Guns are evil.*

That’s not even worth addressing

*You don’t have a right to shoot someone just because they break into your house.*

Actually, a man’s dwelling is inviolable, and any who do violate it, basically surrender their rights. 

I hope you’ll forgive me for not making the distinction between a really bad criminal, when my girlfriend is sleeping in the other room. When my infirm neighbor is asleep. When no one is awake to be summoned for help, and when I might only have one opportunity to shoot first.

*There is no reason to shoot an unarmed man.*

There are plenty of people who can kill with their bare hands. I’m really glad for you if you’ve never experienced a beating

Obviously, or if they already are trying to, and I feel I might lose that fight, I have every right to pull the trigger.

Also

*There are other ways to solve problems than with violence.*

I agree with you 100%. I will always try to solve a problem non-violently. However

*But...*

I am sure you can come up with a thousand different arguments. I can come up with a thousand different counterpoints. Here are three basic statements that will nullify most arguments you can bring against guns:
Police can’t be everywhere
Society is a contract
There is great evil in this world

1) I was in an ice cream shop with some friends. As I walked out there was a family sitting by the door. The little boy instantly screamed ""Look mommy he has a gun!!"" The entire restaurant looked at me, as if I was about to commit a crime.

2) In my other daily activities, but was worried that he would get kicked out of places. I just gave him my opinion and it ended very positively.

I guess some people would rather turn a blind eye to what's really happening with peoples rights and look at shitty pictures anyway.

And this from a community that (rightfully) goes around correcting people on terms like ‘’clip’’ and ‘’assault rifle.’’ (If you're unclear on the definition of an assault rifle, I realize I sound arrogant

The primary topics I intend to discuss are listed below. If you would like me to discuss any other topics, of course), once we have agreed upon the facts.

* ***Accuracy vs Precision***

* ***“Tolerances”***

* ***Felt Recoil vs Total Recoil***

* ***Loudness***

________________________

***Accuracy vs Precision***

Accuracy for the actual machine that is your rifle is (basically) irrelevant. Yes

**Accuracy** is how close the average result is to the intended result. 

**Precision** is how close each result is to the others.
 
Poor accuracy is easily remedied by zeroing your sights properly. Precision is a result of your barrel

The only time accuracy would be relevant for a rifle is if the point of impact is so far out of line with the bore that you physically cannot adjust your sights far enough.

For the shooter, and 10 precise shots might kill the shit out of the tree next to your target. But neither of those are what you’re aiming for.

Personally, and that is that the rifle groups tightly. Even though that's not technically what they said.
__________________________

***“Tolerances”***

I see this term thrown around a lot, the person should be saying clearances.

**Tolerances** refer to the permitted variation from the intended dimensions of a completed part in a manufacturing process.

**Clearances** refer to the intended “space” between two parts

**Allowances** refer to the ‘’extra’’ material that is present after a step in a manufacturing process

Your AK is not more reliable because it has higher ‘’tolerances.’’ High tolerances mean a poorly made firearm. Full stop. High tolerances means the manufacturer was unwilling to spend the money to ensure low variation and high consistency in their product. If your QC allows for a barrel diameter of .220 inches ± .0002 inches

Your AK is reliable because it has high *clearances*, and the blood of fascists to build up without affecting the functionality of the firearm. If you have a 1.00 inch wide magazine than must fit into a 1.06 inch wide magazine well, then you have .06 inches of clearance between the two parts. 

Lastly, you better not make that barrel with an outer diameter of .502 inches, or you want have enough material to make the threads.

__________________________

***Recoil***

Recoil essentially breaks down into two relevant topics – total recoil and felt recoil.

**Force** is the ability to make an object accelerate. How much it accelerates depends on the object’s mass. Force is what causes felt recoil.

**Impulse** is the total change in momentum of an object. Impulse is the total recoil.

The impulse imparted onto the shooter and his rifle is equal 
to the bullet’s muzzle velocity times its mass (plus the momentum that results from the expelled propellant gases - thanks to /u/TwoHands for this addition).

I=∆p=m*v

Where I is impulse, and v is velocity.

You *cannot change the impulse*, by the way, the rifle’s proper name, as all Nagant did was design the god damn magazine spring. His name is only used to refer to the rifle in the Western world) of Motherland, or a 5 inch thick rubber sissy pad (I guess I’m a sissy, because recoil pads rock). I don’t care. The impulse is the same. Unless you want to redefine physics and say that the Law of Conservation of Momentum is no longer valid, you cannot change the impulse imparted onto a gun by a bullet of a known weight and muzzle velocity. *Nothing* ‘’absorbs’’ recoil. The closest thing would be a muzzle brake, of course

So what *can* you change? Felt recoil. This can be changed in two main ways: by spreading the impulse out over a longer period of time (we’re still talking hundredths of a second here) or by increasing the mass that the recoil is acting on.

The former follows the equation 

I=F*t

Where I is once again impulse

Rubber butt pads are, and serve to increase the time over which the rifle is smashing against your shoulder, thus reducing the average force and overall ouchiness of firing the gun. Another way to increase the time of impact would be to adopt a looser stance (with your body, not your grip. If you don’t hold the stock against your shoulder, it is going to hurt). In the same way that a boxer leans away from a punch to soften the blow, allowing yourself to lean back (as it’s firing, that is. I’m not referring to the infamous “chick lean”) with the gun will decrease felt recoil. You may have seen this in some videos of people shooting large bore rifles or shotguns. Bending your elbows has the same effect for handguns.

The second way of reducing felt recoil is by increasing the mass of the firearm.

F=m*a

Where F is still force, simple as that. This is why shooting the 2’’ .357mag S&amp;W airweight revolver that the RSO handed to you with a grin on his face on the first day you ever shot a gun feels like getting stabbed in the hand, whereas shooting the 6’’ .357mag S&amp;W 686 next to it is rather pleasant, despite them both firing the same round. But I’m totally not speaking from personal experience, so make of that what you will.

__________________________

***Loudness***

**Well, since they were anyways only intended to serve as examples to further the general ideas. Instead they caused confusion. Thus, off with their heads!**

~~(Thank you to /u/Szalkow for correcting me here. Loudness scales by a factor of 2 for every +10 dB

This topic I will only cover very briefly

The scale used to describe the loudness of a sound is logarithmic, where 110 dB would be 110% as loud as 100 dB, 110 dB is actually multiple times as loud.

A suppressor or ear plug that decreases the muzzle report by 30 dB is decreasing the sound by orders of magnitude. This is a big fucking deal. USE YOUR HEARING PROTECTION. ALWAYS.

The second and final point I will make on this subject is that sound decreases as a function of the square of the distance from the source. This means that if you are twice as far away as your friend is from the gun being fired, your ears may be up to twice as close to the muzzle, making the sound 4x as loud. 

This has not taken into account the effect of muzzle brakes/compensators. Most of the sound from a gun without any muzzle devices is ‘’projected’’ forward. However, and the sound will go along with them. 

____________________________

So there’s my guide. If you find any errors

**TL;DR** I would say ‘’screw you this took me over an hour to write so read the whole damn thing

* A good gun is precise. Accuracy for the gun comes from properly zeroing it. A good shooter is both accurate and precise (consistent).

* If you’re saying your gun has high tolerances as though that’s a good thing

* Felt recoil is how much it hurts. Total recoil is how much it’s ‘’pushing’’ you. Felt recoil is easy to decrease with butt pads and heavier guns

* Sound is measured on a logarithmic scale, so standing 2x as far from the gun makes it 4x quieter, and 3x as far away makes it 9x quieter. Wear your goddamn ear protection.

EDIT:  It's interesting to watch the headlines evolve on Google News.  9 shot by gunman &gt; 2 dead

**EDIT2:** They keep updating the linked article

&gt;One law enforcement official said that based on the preliminary investigation

Either way, put his gun away and then later was confronted by police and drew on them.

EDIT3: NYT article headline now changed to not mention that anyone was hurt. One gunman shot and killed by police.

""A STATEMENT FROM RONNIE BARRETT:

Barrett’s Position Regarding the Assault on Liberty
February 20

Barrett opposes those who are illegally disarming the American public from their efficient arms and creating superior armed elitist government agencies. 

Elected state officials of New York, these officials now cause their state and local policing agencies to enforce these unconstitutional and illegal so called “laws”. 

By current law, cannot and will not service or sell to New York government agencies. Barrett also applies this stance to the individual elected official who, as a matter of public record, has voted for or created regulation that violates the constitutional rights of their citizens. This is an expansion of our 2002 ban against the California government due to their second amendment infringements, and shall apply to any future violators. 

In the course of world history there have been officials that strip inalienable rights from the people that were given to all by our Creator. Most of these officials inevitably come to trial

Intentionally violating constitutional rights by officials that have sworn to uphold them should have severe prison sentences. 

With the clear vision of horrible events in history repeating itself

During this era of assault on liberty

What better resource to have than such a varied group of individuals sharing knowledge about a subject that they all enjoy?

""Wow, someone voicing an opinion different than your self proclaimed ""expert"" opinion. Can people just take a step back off from being a know-it all long enough to treasure and enjoy what a great community this is?

[–]sewiv 50 points 2 days ago

It's fantastic to see another new shooter out there.

However

    That lean. Shoulders in front of hips. It's not at all a question of strength

    That grip. When I'm teaching new woman shooters, but it works.

    Feet are way too far apart. Shoulder width apart or a touch more or less, weak foot forward. Knees unlocked, about a 55/45 weight split front/rear. Shoulders in front of hips.

    She really should be starting with a .22. Every single thing you need to know about shooting handguns, and a proper grip and stance takes care of that for you.

    Unlocked elbows are okay

Learning the basics correctly

That said


TL:DR Quit being a know-it all! Try and help people.

After several hours of orientation and instruction over a couple of days we headed off for our local indoor pistol range.  By the time we got there he was nervous but excited.  We donned our eyes and ears and proceeded into the range.  The gun for the day was Heritage Manufacturing Rough Rider .22LR.  Nothing fancy

We weren't alone in the range.  My wife was in the next lane testing out our new Sig Sauer P938.  My nephew jumped the first time she fired it, I loaded it, disengaged the safety, and handed it to him.  He aimed and...

...nothing.

He kept the barrel pointing down range the whole time, and we'll try again when he feels he's ready.

Here's how it went down and here's how it was handled.  The shooter was given the load and make ready command, then lots of screaming and four letter words.  The .45 entered his upper thigh and exited just above the knee then re-entered his upper calf and exited his lower calf.  The match director and ROs went into crisis management mode - and they calmly did a great job.  There were at least 2 EMTs shooting the match.  One immediately starting treating the patient, the other went and retrieved his well stock personal trauma bag (there is a trauma bag present at all matches that's provided by the club).  The match director called 911 to report the accident and that the patient was currently being treated for a non life threatening injury.  He then went out to the club entrance to lead EMS right to the scene.  The ROs had everyone unholster and bag up their guns and move away from the bay where the accident occurred.  The match director and ROs handled this like pros.

Last week I took a ton of shit for a post describing a HiPoint shooter who was DQ'd from a match for gross safety violations.  This is what happens when people don't/can't follow the rules.  Shooting accidents are rarely minor and often fatal.  This is why safety violations are treated as a DQ'ing offense.",,t5_2qhc8,1370282447.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/1fkt93/self_inflicted_nd_wound_during_a_match/

The bill, co-chairman of the legislature's public safety committee, would make public the names and addresses of permit holders under Connecticut's Freedom of Information Act — and would reverse lawmakers' decision to protect that personal information from disclosure nearly two decades ago.

The gun shops run by the long-winded / narrow-minded individuals who are infallible and ""everyone else is wrong"".  Lately there has been a plethora of posts by these select few bemoaning the contributions by those who aren't them.  

The thing they don't even consider is that these ""look at my first gun"" pics or ""which CCW is best?"" inquiries are probably posts by those new to firearms ownership or looking to get into it.  And by greeting them with disdain and complaints of ""lack of original content"" it just exacerbates the long-standing reputation of gun owners being unapproachable snobs and that if you aren't inherently versed in the subject you should just go away and 'not bother us big boys' with your newbie questions and opinions.  

In a forum of 40k subscribers a handful are trying to dictate content **they** want to see.  And it wouldn't be wrong if they did it in a manner of soliciting ideas and building a community from there.  But to do it by blatantly disrespecting and condescending folks?  That is just another manifestation of BMOC syndrome - having a power trip because they happen to know a few more technial details or because they have a clique that follows the hive mindset.  

When I first joined Gunnit I was excited that a community of shooters/gun owners had been able to transcend the typical bullshit of elitism and showed camaraderie towards one another - across all skill/knowledge levels.  Then, and suddenly Gunnit changed.  

There is no question that technical knowledge is a desired evolution of gun ownership.  The more you learn

This post may get downvoted into oblivion - it may be met with shouts of ""good riddance"" - and I'll probably get accused of being too sensitive for the internet.  So be it.  But as a parting shot to the jackasses who have probably driven away a plethora of others before me?  Have your damn forum.  I'm going to go spend my time with a better class of people.

NYPD officer here to answer any questions. Here are some facts:

•Every officer hired since the introduction of pistols in the NYPD back in the early nineties is NOT allowed to use a revolver as their service weapon. They must choose between a Glock 19

•Everyone who is allowed to carry a gun in the department (not everyone is) has to re-qualify once every six months (give or take

•MOST NYPD officers fire their FIRST gun, some as young as 21 to as old as 35 shooting for their very first time, and on a DAO pistol.

•The qualifications are HORRIBLE mad get dumbed down every year.

•The NYPD offers once a month training for members to use

•Our tactical training is a joke and maybe ten people in a department of 34K have had Active Shooter training (I'm not exaggerating).

There is a lot broken

Some of our members NEVER take their service weapons out of their gun belts

The NYPD has been tight fisted with ammo for the longest time. Take your one box and be happy.

Range cleanup days are not enough, brass, cardboard, glass, clays, and whatever the fuck else someone wants to shoot.  Its disgusting.  

What really set me off on this today was that I had a new shooter with me.  Someone who had never even held a gun before.

What an amazing impression, having to go out into the woods and clean up this guys mess.

But I also encourage you to start calling people out on this shit.  You see somebody doing something shitty, tell them to knock it the fuck off.  Make sure the people around you are cleaning up after themselves.  Even better if you can get them to do a little extra.  If you want a place to shoot in 10 years, you think about this.

I ran through my drills (after waiting an hour - my local range is always packed on the weekends), and then had the older boy shoot it - he did pretty well, shooting a 5-shot group at 5 yards that many people would be envious of. Then it was the younger boy's turn. I finished packing up and turned to the range officer, telling him that I was done and that my lane was free. When I turned back, the younger boy was crying and being consoled by his mother, and I instantly knew what must have happened: the boy had tried to take a shot and found the gun too much for him to handle. I looked at their gear, and it seemed that they only had the one pistol

I asked them if they had any smaller guns with them - they said ""no"". I offered to have him shoot my Model 18; I went straight into teaching mode. I had him dryfire it a couple times to get used to the manual of arms, and then he sat down on a chair behind the line with a smile: rather than having to sit out while his brother and parents got to have all the fun, he got to sling some lead with the big boys.

Here's why:

Think about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead.

Basilisk?  Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express.  Worried about its Medusa-gaze?  Wear night vision goggles.  The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes.  You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it.

Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, carrying a SPAS-12.

And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters?  Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons.  Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins.  God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.

Now I know what you're going to say:  ""But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!""  Yeah

Avada Kedavra

Imagine Harry out in the woods, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill.  I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that.  Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core.  Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second.  Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound. 

I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:

""Well then I guess it's a good thing my 1911 holds 7+1.""

My funds had not been deposited into my account in 7 days.  
I emailed them asking why and here is what they said...  

&gt;Hi Charles

&gt;I apologize for the delay in reaching out to you. There was some research I had to perform regarding your account. Everything appears in order however, or telephone order transactions for firearms or weapons. Those types of sales put a stop to all deposits.

&gt;Because this transaction for $1625.00 was for a firearm that was sold when the card was not present, or Internet transactions of this type using Square. You can use Square for any other type of transaction not listed in the section I referenced above.

&gt;To read more about the User Agreement

&gt;Please respond before 4 pm PDT tomorrow (Friday) since I do not work weekends and would like to help you resolve this matter quickly. You can respond after that but I only check email once on Saturday and Sunday. I appreciate your patience and cooperation throughout this inquiry.

&gt;David
Square Account Services  

And the email I sent back    

&gt;I do not understand why there is a restriction on a legitimate sale of an inanimate object. I think this is absolutely ridiculous.  

&gt;I agree to not use Square for this type of sale ever again.   
But I also agree to never use or recommend this service again.  

&gt;I thank you for your time

Here is their website  
https://squareup.com/  

Here is their Support Email  
compliance@help-messaging.squareup.com  

I will update when I get an answer back.    


**Small Edit: I wrote this in a comment below. I feel it adds to this.**  

People vehemently avoid PayPal because of their history with firearms.  
I am merely trying to point out the obvious.  
I have the *possibility* of loosing quite a good bit of money from this little predicament I find myself in.  

Here are two quotes from people on other forums that add to the aggravation.  
&gt;This is odd because my local forum just had a group buy of 100 AR15 lowers @ $250ea go through without issue with Square.

&gt;It wasn't with GB but with a firearms manufacturer.  

and  

&gt;Never had an issue with square and I'm an ffl. 
 
&gt;I swipe and punch stuff in manually. When we switched to square we made it very clear what we were and what we sell and they were ok with it.  

Now

**Edit:**  

They have unfroze my account.  

This is a response to an email someone sent in  
&gt;We regret that you will not be using our services, phone, and internet sales of weapons, where the credit card number is manually-entered into Square, involve situations where we, and the weapons merchant, cannot confirm the identity of the buyer.
Our policy, parts, ammunition, and other accessories are permissible for card-not-present transactions.
More information about Square’s Merchant User Agreement can be found here:
https://squareup.com/legal/merchant-ua
Section 6 provides additional details regarding prohibited businesses.
Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

**Full Edit and conclusion.**
&gt;A little update. The buyer cancelled the sales so all is well.  
I just wanted to inform you of the bug.  



&gt;I would like to apologize for my harsh words.  
I was told by many people that Square had all the legal right in the world to simply keep my funds.  
I was extremely angry and acted out of impulse.  
I still hope to do business with you guys in the future.  
and I understand that it is more about the possibility of CC fraud then it is the actual firearms.  
If you would have worded your response a little different I think that is what you meant

I went to the Poughkeepsie-area gun show today, rather disappointing. Lots of milsurp gear and *lots* of knives, not that many guns, and no good prices. In one corner was a guy who sounded like he was from the Bronx or near there, selling Mausers, mosins, and a few other older rifles.

I spent some time looking at the mosins, a couple of guys came up, commented on the price, and were trying to get the guys attention to ask him a few questions. I happily answered all their questions for them, and informed them that I personally owned one.

While they were there, stopped by, and asked me a few questions about the mosins as well. This trend continued, and after awhile, I guess people assumed I worked there, and continued asking me mosin questions. After about 20 minutes of showing a few very interested guys what was what, including visually showing them how to take them apart (without actually doing so) and telling them my experience with cosmoline (terrible gunk, that's about $330, and he looked at me and said ""you really know your mosins... thanks for the sales."" and handed me $40 in a handshake. I didn't see the money ;til it was in my hand

**EDIT: Updating some points to make myself a little more clear**

So apparently


* **All posts must be gun related.**

Sure

[Not strictly gun related

My point is

**EDIT:** For everyone that is saying the Buck Compton post was stupid, 501st PIR, WW2) died yesterday, also check out the terminal ballistics of this .32 S7W wadcutter."" Fuck.


* **No memes.**

[Exhibit A](http://i.imgur.com/7cL4A.png)
Some people find meme's amusing. Some don't. Let the upvotes/downvotes decide. 

**EDIT:** Personally, should it be moderated? What about memes in the comments? What about non-visual memes? Like soviet russia, RAKE, RIFLE IS FINE, ಠ_ಠ, etc? No memes right? 

How about we let /r/guns use goddamn discretion


* **No rage comics.**

Here are some rage comics you might miss out on if you head is planted firmly up your ass:

[Gun shop employees](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/rx5bo/gun_shop_employees/)

Again

**EDIT:** Got it


* **No posting of another users' personal information.**

This is already in the reddit general rules. Perhaps you could just say all rules that apply to the reddit in general apply here. Or you could just leave it out. 


* **No asking questions about illegal firearms modifications.**

Who defines what is illegal? What country's laws shall apply? US law? What state? New York? New JerseySince when is information illegal? This isn't communist china last I checked. There are plenty of people that post here that have the license to manufacture all types of firearms. Others may be from a country with no restrictions on modifications. If I need help installing a DIAS or cutting down the the barrel of my SBS

Alright

When information is suppressed

**EDIT:** bellemarematt makes an excellent point. AR-15's (unless crippled) are illegal in California. Should we not discuss them? 15 rounds magazines are illegal in New York, it's illegal. You can't prevent stupid, but saying ""hush now, big brother doesn't want you talking about that"" is silly. 

*But storelogix

**THAT""S ILLEGAL OMG!!**

Not necessarily. Because it might not be. Doesn't answer his goddamn question though. Why should OP have to reveal that he lives in Antarctica, guys, he said hes a gov't agent/FFL, you can talk about it now, he would never lie*.) Discussion is not illegal.

There are plenty of legitimate reasons why this rule is fucking retarded. 


* **No blogspam.**

Error: Rule too vague.


In conclusion

Back in 1934 congress passed the [National Firearms Act (NFA)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Firearms_Act). This regulated a  few types of weapons including; [machine guns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_guns), [suppressors aka silencers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppressor), [destructive devices (DD)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destructive_device), and [any other weapons (AOW)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_II_weapons#Any_Other_Weapon) which is a kind of catch-all for other weapons they wanted to regulate. All weapons that fall into one of these categories are considered [Title II weapons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_II_weapons). Any weapons that don't fall under the NFA but do fall under the [gun control act of 1968](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_Control_Act) are considered title I weapons due to them being Title I of the U.S. federal firearms laws.

To transfer Title II weapons you usually go to someone who holds a [Federal Firearms License (FFL)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Firearms_License) AND holds a [Special Occupational Tax (SOT)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Firearms_License#Special_Occupational_Tax_Classes). This is where the misconception of ""Class 3"" came from. The FFL that you transfer the title II weapon through usually has a Class 1, and they typically hold a class 3 SOT. The weapon you wish to transfer must also be legal in your state. State NFA laws make no sense, some allow machine guns (with any barrel length) but not SBRs. CA still allows AOWs I believe but not SBSs, so you have to do your own research here. Before a transfer of a title II weapon can take place, the ATF must approve it, even if it is between two FFLs. The most common forms an individual would be familiar with is form 1, 3

A [form 3](http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-5320-3.pdf) is used between two FFLs with an SOT, and if they are a FFL/SOT they would fill out a form 3 with your receiving FFL/SOT's information. Once approved they would ship it to your FFL/SOT. 

A [form 4](http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-5320-4.pdf) is used as a transfer to/from an individual, meaning you!). Continuing the above example your FFL/SOT receives the suppressor and will give you two copies of a form 4 with some of the information filled out. You complete anything they are missing, sign it, and include $200 to transfer anything except AOWs, they are $5. This price has been the same since 1934 when the NFA passed. If you are transferring it individually you (currently) must also include a picture, fingerprints, a local chief law enforcement officer sign off, nor fingerprints

A [form 1](http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-5320-1.pdf) is used to manufacturer a title II weapon. Typically this is used for SBRs and SBSs, or trust fill out the form 1, include the necessary information (fingerprint, photo, LEO sign off, and 922g if doing it individually), and pay the ATF $200 (even for AOWs). After waiting the 7ish months you should get your approved form back and you can make the title II weapon. Note: there are also engraving requirements for your name (or trust, state on the weapon. 

Private sales of some title II weapons are legal in some states

After you have your title II weapon with your approved stamp there are a few differences in how you can use it over regular guns. First it is recommended that you always carry a copy of your approved form. Technically/legally you only have to show this to an ATF officer, you can not take title II weapons out of state without approval (except for AOWs and suppressors). To get approval you need to fill out a [5320.20](http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-5320-20.pdf). The ATF turns these around very quickly, inside 2-3 weeks in my experience. They will only approve 5320.20's for a date range of 1 year, so you have to put in one for each state each year if you wish to travel with them. Third, you ""must"" [report any lost or stolen NFA weapons](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/pagedetails.action;jsessionid=b332b3b5fdff8c4a6529b5d6a34e82f87a4b3373f0c339cf3d70963b16fbcc6b.e38NbxuQaNiKbi0LchmOc3eNb3v0?browsePath=Title+27%2FChapter+I%2FSubchapter+M%2FPart+179%2FSubpart+J%2FSection+179.141&amp;granuleId=CFR-2002-title27-vol1-sec179-141&amp;packageId=CFR-2002-title27-vol1&amp;collapse=true&amp;fromBrowse=true), though it doesn't seem like there are any penalties. And lastly you can't loan any title II weapons to anyone. If you transferred it via a corporation or trust anyone on the trust or corporation can posses it. This doesn't mean others cant shoot it, but you have to be there. Also you do not give up any 4th amendment protections, though I wouldn't recommend that phrasing. This rumor probably came from if you have a FFL/SOT

Cool I have $200 for the tax and a few hundred for a machine gun, the entry point is usually a Mac-10 at 3-4k currently. M16's run 11-19k, and belt feds will get up to 60k+. Some popular boards for NFA items are [subguns](http://subguns.com/boards/) and [sturmgewehr.com](http://www.sturmgewehr.com/webBBS/nfa4sale.cgi). This price insanity only applies to machine guns, suppressors and other title II weapons can still be made so they aren't too overpriced. 

So why do people use a trust? The primary reason is to avoid the LEO sign off, and you wouldn't have to officially transfer the weapon through the ATF. People claim (mainly lawyers) that you shouldn't draft your own trust using quicken or other tools. If there is a problem with your trust down the road you would be in violation of federal firearm regulations, though you can modify the trust at that point. My trust cost $500 from a lawyer, and I got to talk to him for 2 hours on many different firearm topics, and he also continues to answer my few questions by email when I have them. Considering I plan on putting $10k+ of weapons into my trust it was worth the $500 to me to not have any problems with the ATF. 

Other forms if you are interested; [form 0](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=iEeMJgV75nQ#t=53s) transfer for native american reservations [form 2](http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-5320-2.pdf) manufactured or imported, or to/from gov, [form 6a](http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-5330-3c.pdf) imported firearms, [form 9](http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-5320-9.pdf) permanent export of firearms. [form 10](http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-5320-10.pdf) for government entities.

Pre-sample and post-sample refer to pre/post 1986 machine gun dealer samples. Today pre/post samples can only be transferred between FFL/SOTs or Police which is why they are so cheap. FFLs with SOTs (class 2) can also make their own new machine guns, unless the selling FFL/SOT is going out of business. In that case all post samples must be sold/destroyed immediately, though pre-samples can kept by the former FFL (But they can't transfer it to other individuals).

1343575601.0,xcdyy,Why I Open Carry,,1194,522,769,"I open carry. I'm not the uneducated stereotype of someone who walks around with a handgun on their hip. First of all, I’m actually from a rather wealthy family. I attend a top 20 university. My boyfriend and I will go shooting together- he actually has a range at his house.

But back to open carrying.

The average height of an American female is 5’4.5. The average height of an American male is 5’10. The average weight for men aged 20-74 years is 191 pounds. The average weight for women the same age group is 164.3 (all of these height statistics are from last year

I’m 5’2, I most likely could not fight off an average sized male, or even a slightly above average female, simply due to size (I’ve actually gotten in physical altercations with my larger but younger sister when we were kids, and this is true in my experience).

But remember. I’ve been shooting since I was 4.

And I’m a damned good shot.

I’ve been mugged. I’ve been raped, and started open carrying. I have not been assaulted since. Having a gun on my hip scares away people who would want to do me harm- and if someone attempted to go after me again, I would not hesitate to pull the trigger. I tend to like animals more than I like people, and I grew up hunting. So even though later on, I would feel bad about it, and probably shed a few tears, I would not regret pulling the trigger because I *refuse to ever be a victim again.*

1373139215.0,1hrh0y,So you're going to buy your first gun...,BlackPullet,827,174,127,"Great!  Shooting can be a lot of fun

**You're probably thinking about hardware right now**.  Lucky for you, *[many](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/wiki/faq)* discussions about good first guns (which you no doubt found when you read [the FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/wiki/faq)), and I've even written [one of my own](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/1ibkog/how_to_choose_your_first_handgun/).

Finding your perfect firearm is fun and interesting

Let's talk about the other considerations that are often ignored in these ""First time buyer"" threads

1) **Safety**.

Know the [basics of gun safety](http://training.nra.org/nra-gun-safety-rules.aspx) before you walk into a gun store to even look.  Once you're there, and keep your finger off the trigger unless you're ready to shoot.  If the employees aren't doing the same, find a new store.

2) **Think about the rest of your personal security first**

First, even in the most clear-cut self-defense imaginable, *severely injuring or killing another human being is going to mess with your life*.  Legally, emotionally, and financially, if you have to defend yourself with deadly force, right or wrong, and that's assuming you come out alive and relatively intact.  So you need to look around at other parts of your life that make that exceptionally crappy situation more likely.

If you need a gun because you're moving to a crappy neighborhood, get the cops involved too, document it.  If you're banging a heavily armed biker's wife/husband/mom, well, stop. 

Buying a gun while ignoring other risks in your personal security plan is like having a diet soda with your triple-decker burger and chili-fries.  Sure

3) **Be honest with yourself about how you'll be using the gun**

First, and those are both different than the right guns for putting holes in distant paper (or distant deer) on a Saturday afternoon.  The right gun for carry in Minneapolis winters is the wrong gun for carry in Miami summers.  There's nothing wrong with any reason you have (even ""because they're fun!""), but don't whip yourself up in fear of polar bears when you really want a gun for Miami-carry, and don't buy a super-compact carry gun if you're north of the Arctic circle.

4) **Learn the laws and rules at the federal, and really local levels**

Every country, and city has laws, and the interactions between them can be even more complicated, especially for carry.  Learn them for where you live, work, and travel often.  [Handgunlaw.us](http://handgunlaw.us) will get you started, but it's no substitute for talking to a lawyer specializing in gun and concealed carry law about the oddities of your particular jurisdiction(s).

Equally importantly

Even think about *really* local issues.  There's no shortage of posts on here along the lines of ""My girlfriend/boyfriend/roommate/cat said they'd move out if I buy a gun

5) **Get enough training to be more of a danger to bad guys than you are to yourself**

If you've never really shot guns, mechanics of guns and ammo, basics of shooting, basic laws in your area, and ideally, maintenance and cleaning.  Most also have a live-fire portion so you can shoot, and more importantly

Many states require training to apply for a concealed carry permit, a gun is not a magical talisman, it is a tool for *you* to use to keep yourself safe, and *you* need training to use it well.

Finally, they at least need to know how to safely move, unload and secure the weapon without you present, for that one day you leave it on the bedside table and they've got to dust.  As an aside, that knowledge alone might make spark a bit more interest and address some of the issues in #4.

6) **How are you going to keep your gun(s) safe?**

As you're shopping around for your gun, less still.  Some areas have laws (see #4) about how you can store guns, make sure your plan jives with them.

If you've just bought a pistol, as that's usually easier to attack than the keypad.  If it's got a [tubular lock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubular_pin_tumbler_lock) as a backup access method, you can likely do better, as they're easily picked with basic tools.  Go to a few lock shops in your city to see what they recommend (as they tend to have more secure options than gun stores).  Secure quick-access boxes can be had for the same price as cheap ones, you just have to look harder.  $150-200 is not unreasonable for a secure quick safe, and remember that unless you've bolted it down to something, it doesn't need to be opened to be stolen.

Again, but if you've got teenagers, roommates, or criminals around, you might want to spend the money when you can.  And if you live alone (or with a trusted spouse), in a safe neighborhood, and the rest of your security is good, a bedside cabinet or book safe may be good enough.  But think about how much security you need

7) **Can you take care of it?**

You'll need to clean your gun.  Some tolerate more dirt than others before failing, everything you can do to keep it reliable and in good condition is time well spent.  Your training course (you did take one, right?) should cover the how-to of cleaning, and your local gun store (or YouTube) can show you how to break down whatever you buy, but expect to spend $50 or so on basic cleaning supplies for a handgun, likely more for rifles.  Also, /r/guncleaning.

8) **Can you feed it?**

Ammo is not cheap, and practice needs ammo.  So, expect to spend another $200-300 on the ammo it'll take to get proficient, more so if you're shooting a huge, rare or obscure caliber.  

Also, because they talked about that in that class you took (see #5).

9) **Where can you shoot it?**

Few are lucky enough to have large amounts of safe land and tolerant neighbors, *and then call to see if members of the public can shoot there*.  My nearest 2 ranges are members-only, with 2 and 4.5 year waiting lists, respectively, so despite living on the edges of a major metropolitan area, I drive around 45 minutes to shoot at a place I like.  It's also worth Googling or checking Yelp when you're looking at ranges, because that's where you'll find out about the bad ventilation, and/or crazy owners.  

If your only range is too far, that's something you need to know now before you end up with a $500 tool you can't learn to use.

One other thing to keep in mind is that you need to wear eye and ear protection *every time you shoot*.  Most ranges have it free to rent, etc), you'll need to bring (and buy) your own, around $50.  Remember, *every gunshot you hear unprotected permanently robs you of some of your hearing, and you cannot get it back*.

10) **How much will this really cost?**

There's a lot more to buying your first gun than walking into a store and plunking down cash for hardware

* Governmental Costs (Background Checks, Sales Tax)
* Training
* Cleaning Supplies
* Gun Safe/Quick Access Box
* Defensive Ammo
* Practice Ammo
* Range Fees for your first outing (if it's not part of your training)
* Eye and Ear Protection
* Other accessories (like holsters, snap-caps for practice at home)

These things together can easily cost $400-500 on top of the price of your weapon of choice.  Luckily, but you need to know that these expenses are there before you plug the price of your favorite gun into the ""Becoming Armed"" category in this month's budget and think you're done.

**OK

Shooting is a lot of fun, questions, and expenses, and realize that there's a lot more to buying a gun than running into your local gun store with a wad of cash and a clean background check.",,False,,1373868033.0,t3_1hrh0y

1329324708.0,pqvfz,My state senator is sponsoring a bill to outlaw concealed carry on college campuses (WA state). Here's the email I sent to her.,FreedomsTorch,948,298,270,"[WA SB 5592](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/billinfo/summary.aspx?bill=5592) - Concerning weapons in or on the premises of an institution of higher education

I don't see much chance of this bill passing

&gt;Senator

&gt;I am disheartened to see you're a sponsor of SB5592. I'm hopeful your intention is to prevent violence and harm to your constituents and all citizens in our great state, to prevent violence on college campuses and at associated events, while simultaneously preventing otherwise law-abiding citizens from effectively defending themselves simply because they're on a campus.

&gt;It is particularly concerning that you and the other sponsors are not only attempting to prevent otherwise lawful carry of firearms

&gt;Obviously you believe this is necessary and wouldn't presume to violate such rights without a highly justifiable cause. Perhaps you believe that criminals, though I must admit this belies ordinary logic and would ask that you proffer evidence of such. Maybe there is an epidemic of gun violence at Washington colleges of which I'm unaware. Is there something magical about the campus of a college that makes it a bad place to legally carry a weapon as opposed to the areas in its immediate vicinity? A clarification as to the necessity for this law would be greatly appreciated.

&gt;One must also consider the unintended consequences. Since this is not a trait which politicians are known for, we can assume that carriers with permits will likely disarm themselves voluntarily and follow your new law should it pass.

&gt;This presents multiple problems. First, this could mean multiple bus rides with connecting points at transit terminals that are, to say the least, some of the more crime intensive locations. I wouldn't want to be a small female at the Downtown Seattle bus terminal at 11PM by myself and disarmed. I suggest you try it sometime if you don't believe me.

&gt;Another problem is that those who drive their own vehicle will likely store their weapon in their vehicle. I'm not sure if you're aware, if not the majority, are a result of theft from vehicles. As car burglary is far more prevalent than home burglary, it is an entirely foreseeable conclusion that passage of this law will increase the number of stolen firearms in black market circulation. Thieves looking for guns will know that the parking areas around college campuses will be more likely to yield a firearm, and they will certainly exploit this knowledge for full effect. In other words, this will undoubtedly lead to more gun violence. 

&gt;Most importantly, would be effectively put on notice that college campuses in Washington are a great place to commit their heinous crimes. He certainly wasn't deterred by their no-guns policy.

&gt;Perhaps I'm wrong and there's something I missed. I look forward to your reply.",,t5_2qhc8,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/pqvfz/my_state_senator_is_sponsoring_a_bill_to_outlaw/

The deal was that my Dad had sold all his guns when we were kids in order to put food on the table. He's been missing having one

We were able to get the money together and went with an [American Tactical](http://www.americantactical.us/940/detail.html) 1911 .45 caliber.  

On Christmas morning

He got really quiet and said ""It's been a long time..."" The grin on his face as he turned it over and looked at it had me absolutely ready to burst into tears. 

So then he got to unwrap the ammo (we got him 100 rounds)

He promptly put on his shoes and went outside and shot it several times. It was amazing. My dad, and my future brother-in-law were all outside shooting the gun. I couldn't have been happier.

The next day my Dad finally got to teach me how to fire a weapon. I'll admit

My Dad hasn't let the gun leave his sight. He carried it around the house. He was holding it while he sat on the couch, and he started browsing for accessories  for it. 

I know I didn't go with what you folks suggested

TLDR: r/guns made me confident enough to go to the gun store and buy my dad a gun for Christmas. He flipping loved it. Thanks

1302876284.0,gqqrp,Anyone else a gun-loving liberal?,shadmere,896,310,721,"Before I start off

But yeah.  I love guns.  I've only got one (an XDm bought last week after a lot of gunnit's advice!), own, and carry firearms.  

I am for *some* gun control.  I think a basic background check makes sense, especially local ordinances and such, are common sense; stuff that no one in their right mind would do anyway.  (Setting up firing ranges next to elementary schools, stuff like that.)  But for the most part, I'm against the more severe forms of gun control.  I think it's a shame that there are places where people can't carry, or even own, a firearm.  That bothers me intrinsically.

But almost all of my other politics are pretty left wing.  Ten years ago I would have called myself a moderate, I'm for better funded schools, I'm usually pro-union (depends on the union), I'm basically pro-choice, and I'm anti-corporate.  I'm for progress, I'm for science, I'm for the separation of church and state.  (I'm *not* anti-religious, and it bothers the hell out of me that some politicians have proposed it.)  

If this means higher taxes

And that's where I end up having problems.  I want to vote for politicians that are against gun control, my views line up.  If a corporation ever completely purchases a state and converts it to private property, then that population can kiss any consitutional rights they had goodbye.)

So any other liberals here?  How do you make your decisions?

The JTFOC will no longer sell prohibited items to law enforcement agencies or any government agencies in states, and municipalities that have enacted restrictive gun control laws against their law abiding citizens.

He carried it for a month before the captain made him lock it in the armory since it wasn't an issued weapon.  Roughly a month later, he asked if it was Army issue.  ""Yes!"" Dad answered, ""In 1858.""  He also commented on the revolver and expressed the same concerns.  ""But, sir,"" interjected their lieutenant, ""he's already used it in combat.""  General didn't say another word and their squad actually got a commendation for that inspection.

Edit: Taking cell phone pictures of 40 year old pictures doesn't yield very good results.  Please excuse the quality.

FINAL EDIT: Glad the morning crew and day crew enjoy this just as much.  I'm blown away by how much Gunnit enjoyed this and I'm sure my father will get a kick out of it, I'll get some better scans.

Hi /r/guns - I was hoping you could help me out.

I've been pretty anti-gun (for purposes other than hunting and law enforcement) for as long as I can remember.  I honestly can't imagine many scenarios where I think they would improve a situation - recently I had someone show up to a party my friend was hosting with a sidearm on his hip and it made me *wildly* uncomfortable.

**However**

The problem is I don't really know how to go about broadening my view in this area.  Are there some good books to read?  Is it going to take me going to a shooting range and actually confronting firing a weapon?  Do I just show up at a shooting range and confess I have no idea what I'm doing and that I don't ever really want to own a gun?

I'm not here to debate people


**Edit:** I greatly appreciate all the offers from Arizona gunnit members to take me shooting

**Edit2:** I should probably explain my unease with guns further.  I'm uneasy around guns in social settings (stores, only that it adds an element of (what I consider to be unnecessary) danger to the situation.  I'm fine with the idea of walking into a shooting range because I *expect* guns to be there, and the environment is equipped to handle them.  It's not like bringing someone afraid of clowns to a circus.  I'm willing to admit that this feeling may be irrational or unfounded, but that's why I'm here.

I've been raped.

But holding that gun, barely above the 18-in limit. Light. Smooth trigger, smooth pump. I know this probably isn't true, but it's as if whoever designed it thought of people like me. People who struggle with opening jars and reaching things on the fridge, people who wince away in fear if they pass a large man on the street.

Oh my God... I don't have to be afraid at night anymore. Oh my God.
Thank you

**tl;dr:** My whole life I have felt and believed I am weak and powerless to stop people from hurting me. Now that I have been given a weapon that is *mine*, you guys.


**edit:** WOW, but please understand that this brought up a lot of stuff for me. However, despite that, I DO respect the seriousness that a deadly weapon entails. I do intend to practice, and I am taking lessons from my mom's boyfriend, who used to make a living training cops. I am committed to making the habits of firearms safety (not pointing the muzzle at anything you don't intend to destroy, not touching the trigger, thank you for the kind words

I decided to post my personal defense rifle and why I decided to go with certain options. Keep in mind these are all opinions and only you can decide what works for you. I'm pretty dismissive of ""You have to get part ""X"" for your rifle and brand ""Y"" cause it's so operatorlolz"". I am pretty certain that a rifle you intend to defend yourself with needs a couple of items (Light, etc.) but you have to choose which one's will work in your situation.
Keep in mind when I say ""fighting rifle"" I don't mean ""end of the world Mad Max keep the hoards away"" I'm talking about a rifle I will use to defend my life.

Edit: I put together a parts list and what I paid for each item at the time. That doesn't mean that's what it costs now. Also

1375187911.0,1jcf0u,Armslist Woes: A Gun-Purchase Thankfully Aborted,Caedus_Vao,657,124,256,"I don't normally self-post to bitch

Armslist is usually my default starting point for any gun-related searches;  it's free, no hassle at all. I'm continually looking for Lee-Enfields, and there have been some screaming deals to be had from guys that just didn't know or care what they had, and posted it up online.  

I've got a rolling ""Want to Buy"" for Enfield stuff that I renew periodically, and it turned out to be a 1943 Longbranch No. 4 Mk. I * that was up for sale in my area . A little back-and-forth revealed the following:


* bayonet came with scabbard and frog
* The gun has been shot
* All the serial numbers match
* He's GOT to sell this gun
* He'll throw in 25 ""shells""
* He's local to me

So we agree to meet in the parking lot of a Gander Mountain after work

....and the plot thickens. 


5:45 rolls around, about ten minutes later the red Chevy Blazer he described comes rolling up, but it's thumping god-awful rap and the windows are buzzing in time with the bass.  A faint whiff of shitty weed comes wafting out of the windows, and three guys jump out, sporting clown tattoos and Psychopathic Records gear. At this point, I recognize the music for what it is: Insane Clown Posse. 

....that's right.  Buck is a fucking Juggalo.   Buck the Juggalo. Juggalo Buck. 


At this point, shake hands, and they haul out this Longbranch to take a look at.  Right off, it's filthy, the bolt doesn't match the action, neither match the barrel, and the magazine (marked Savage actually) had no number at all.  The butt's been spliced and repaired a few times, and I see a little bit of wear in the chamber

At this point, Buck*, thinks I.  I tell them right there that this gun is non-matching and a little beat.  I can't do more than $200.  Buck agrees, but first I tell him I have to check the bore.  Thank God I did, because it was blacker and more pitted than Satan's taint.  Fouling pretty much obscured the grooves, but I could see substantial pitting on the lands of the rifling.  I look up and ask him if he was shooting corrosive ammo, or cleaned this gun EVER. 

Juggalo Buck produces a ziploc bag of ammunition.  Sure as shit, he says ""well, can't you just scrub it out or something?"" I briefly explained how rust and corrosion work, and told him that as the gun sat it would be a parts gun for me, and my offer had dropped to $125.  I was secretly hoping he'd just walk away.  


....and this is where I found out that I was flirting with a felony.  

Juggalo Buck's face falls and he's all ""Man, his reply. 

In Ohio, sorry man.  Gotta go."", and they apologetically load up their shit and thump on out of the parking lot. Had the sale actually gone through, I'd have asked to see ID before the money changed hands like always and balked then.  

I sent him a text a little later giving my assessment of his gun, along with a warning that he should probably have someone 18+ sell the gun for him. He was polite and appreciative.


All's well that ends well


**TL;DR**- Almost bought a rusty Lee-Enfield from an underage Juggalo named Buck.
