Ingredients:

* 2 Garlic cloves (minced using a garlic press or finely chopped)
* 3/4 Large Onion (finely chopped)
* 1 tomato (diced)
* 1/2 red bell pepper (diced fine)
* 1/2 yellow bell pepper (diced fine)
* 1 baby eggplant (diced)
* 1/2 zucchini (diced in quarter pieces)
* 1 cup of mushrooms (diced)
* 1 cup mixed veggies (carrots
* 1 box of Lick's Nature Burgers mashed (If you don't have those you can use any veggie burger
* 10 large potatoes 
* 1/2 pack shepherd's pie seasoning (read the labels to make sure no meat product used)
* 2 table spoons of masala spice 
* 2 table spoons of butter or margarine
* 5 - 8 spoons of mayonnaise (depending on your tastes
* Salt 
* Pepper
* 2 Dried chili peppers cut up (use less or none if you don't like a kick)
* 4 - 6 table spoons of Milk (you can use soy or almond milk - add more as necessary for the consistency you need)
* 2 table spoons olive oil
* Kettle of boiled water (to add as you cook to avoid burning / drying)
* 1 egg (whisked &amp; beaten)



Instructions

Top half of your pie - potatoes:

* First peel &amp; dice the potatoes into small pieces so they cook fast
* You should fill the pot you will cook them in with cold water and add the potato pieces as you chop them.
* Once you have your pot filled put it on the burner on high heat until the potatoes are cooked.
* You can over cook them a little because you are going to mash them.
* Once Cooked make mashed potatoes using the milk, pepper and mayo (or yogurt/sour cream).
* Make sure the potatoes are mashed well they should be soft and fluffly but not runny.


Bottom half of your pie - the rest

* Use medium heat on a large sauce pan on the stove with the olive oil
* Throw in the chopped garlic &amp; onions 
* Throw in the salt &amp; pepper to your taste 
* Throw in the tomatoes 
* Throw in the seasonings (shepherd pie seasoning and masala spice)
* Throw in the cut up dried chilies if you are using them. 
* Add the following veggies first: bell peppers
* Add your mashed nature burger patties (or other proteins used)
* Add all other veggies now eggplant
* Add small amounts of water as you need to avoid burning
* Once the veggies and ground patties/veggie ground are all cooked up turn your heat down to minimum and let it simmer for a little bit to achieve a slow cook taste.

Making the pie 

* Get your large corning ware dish or casserole dish and put the veggie cook-up in the base ... fill as much as you can depending on the potato-to-veg ratio you want.
* Take your mash potatoes and put them on top in spoon dollops 
* Smooth down the potatoes over the veggie cook-up.
* Use a cooking brush to lightly brush the egg over the potato to hold it together and brown
* Use a fork to lightly go over the smoothed potato to make pretty lines for presentation and to help you use these guidelines for cutting later.
* Bake in the oven for 30 minutes at 375 degrees F with foil on top of your pie.
* Remove the foil after 30 mins and place back in the oven for 15 - 20 minutes to brown the top depending how brown you want it.
* After the pie is cooked let it stand for 20 - 30 minutes before cutting and you can serve this up with veggie sides or whatever you want to serve it with.

1 1/4 cups green or brown lentils
1 very large onion
6 tablespoons olive oil
salt and pepper
3/4 cups rice


Heat the oil in a skillet, until they are a rich dark brown. About 10-12 minutes. Set aside when done. Meanwhile, put the lentils in a large saucepan with a quart of water and 1 teaspoon salt. Heat until it boils, then simmer for 15 minutes. Then add the rice and plenty of pepper to the saucepan, add water to cover if necessary, then cover and simmer on low heat on for another 15 minutes (or until the rice is cooked). When that's done, add half of the onions to the lentils and rice, cover and let sit for 5 minutes. Serve on plates and add the rest of the onions on top. Serves 4-6.",t5_2ru7e,True

First i would like to thank this subreddit for it's great culinary contribution to my diet. 

A group (which I am a part of) have recently come together to construct a nonprofit cooperative cafe; The goal is providing a free space from both social and political pressure where art and dialog can evolve (we are Palestinians).


Recently we have reached the food issue. We did not receive authorization for gas stove / cooker and will thus only use electric one. Also we prefer to work with local farms and thus will mainly have access to mediterranean flora. (yes

While vegetarian the menu won't be vegan!

Do you have any suggestions beyond a plate of cheese &amp; olives / pasta ? something that can be cooked using an electric stove perhaps? what vegi snack would **YOU** like beside your beer?  

Thank you all in advance for your contribution.    

----------------------------------------------------------------edit-----------------------------------------------------------

Thanks for the great idea; just to clear something up:
1. Bonus points for simplicity this is more of a pub than a restaurant.
2. While the signature palestinian foods like humus and falafel are great they simply do not suite (do not sit well with alchohol / too smelly for a place with an indoor bookshop).

1326122285.0,o9cfl,Vegan Latkes and apple sauce,,36,4,3,"**For the latkes you will need:**

1.5 pounds of russet potatoes

1 medium yellow onion

1 tablespoon of parsley 

.5 teaspoon of baking powder

1 teaspoon salt

.25 cups flour

pepper to taste

oil for frying (I recommend Canola or soy bean oil)

add ons:  you could add garlic or rosemary to this recipe and it would fucking rock.

Peel the potatoes, but not with the potatoes.  Mince the parsley, set aside.  Combine all powder ingredients and set aside.

Squeeze the shredded potatoes in the collander to get out as much liquid from them as possible.  This will make them cook faster and hold together better.

Coat the bottom of a skillet with your cooking oil

Once they have been squeezed, garlic / rosemary, and mix well by hand.  slowly stir in  
the powder ingredients.

once everything has been mixed in, roll it into a ball, and flatten it out, then add to the skillet.  it should take about 4 minutes per side, but it should be brown when it is done cooking- you be the judge.  when you remove each round of latkes from the skillet, they will be pretty oily.  put them on paper towels, newspaper

**For the apple sauce:**

8 good sized apples

enough apple cider to cover the bottom of your pan about 1/4 inch deep

1 lemon

cinnamon to taste

Peel and core the apples

pour the cider into a pan, remove from heat, add 1/4 of the lemon's juice (or to taste) and the cinnamon.  let cool, then chill before serving.

NB's:  
The apple sauce will thicken up more as it cools.  be aware of this when judging consistency. 

It's best to use a more sour apple than you would ordinarily eat.  Cortlandt, winesap, and rhode island greening are all good for this recipe.  If you think it is too tart at the end, you could add a little maple syrup, but add it sparingly. ",,False,t5_2ru7e,True

In a medium sauce pan, bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 10-13 minutes, until quinoa is soft, stirring occasionally.

While the quinoa is simmering, stirring occasionally to ensure they cook evenly.

In a small frying pan, about 3-5 minutes. Add garlic and saute for another minute. Add mushrooms and cook until the mushrooms begin to release their liquid, about 5 minutes. Add the white wine and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, until the wine reduces to half. Add oregano and thyme.

It came out pretty well

Here are the ingredients I used: [http://i.imgur.com/uDcNP.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/uDcNP.jpg).

Anyhow

**Do up the rice**

I put a half cup of organic sushi rice into my rice cooker.  When it was done I stirred it around a little bit

**Prep the stuff you plan on inserting into the sushi rolls**

Cut everything into strips.  I used cucumber, avocado, and some sprouts.  This should be simple enough.  Veges are great, but you know what will really make the sushi awesome?  Yam fried in batter.  It's fucking delicious, trust me.  I cut the skin off of the yam and then diced it into small pieces.  Then I boiled the little yam pieces for like 5-10 mins to soften them.  Then I made up [this](http://www.philamfood.com/images/T/shirakiku-tempra-bttr-mix-10oz_tn.jpg) Tempura Batter Mix and dunked all the little yam pieces into it so they were coated really good.  Last, I fried these batter-soaked yam pieces in a couple tablespoons of vegetable oil.  I put all of my fillings aside.

**Roll up your sushi**

You are going to need a sushi mat and sea-weed wrap (called Nori).  Make sure to wet your hands so the rice doesn't stick to them

**Flavor it up**

I got some pickled ginger, and made some spicy mayo by combining mayonnaise with cock sauce (aka Sriracha sauce).

**ENJOY**  (Green tea = optional)

Pumpkin Lentil Curry Soup with Kale
Recipe yields 5-7 bowls

- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 3 cloves garlic
- 1 can pumpkin puree or equivalent fresh
- 1.5 L veg stock
- 2 cups water
- 1 can whole or crushed tomatoes
- 1(ish) cups red lentils (I eyeballed it using one coffee mug's worth)
- 1 1/2 tsp curry paste
- 2 tsp curry powder
- 1 1/2 tsp cumin
- salt to taste
- 3 generous handfuls chopped kale

1. Heat a large pot and add the olive oil and minced garlic. SautÃ©  until it is lightly browned - watch carefully to make sure it doesn't burn! Add the pumpkin puree, crushed tomato, lentils, and spices.

2. Reduce heat and allow to simmer until lentils are soft

This soup is really easy and good as is - but would probably benefit from some onion (added before/with the garlic in step one) and perhaps some carrot (ditto).. That's probably how I'd make it next time.

2lbs Green Bell Peppers

2 Lbs Yellow Onion

10 Cloves of Garlic

1 pound dried black beans OR 3 cans worth of black beans

Spices / condiments:

Olive Oil

Vegetable Butter (Nature Balance)

brown sugar

chili powder

Cumin

Salt

Pepper

you want to start off by making Sofrito.  do this by finely chopping up all the onions, and cooking in a skillet on high for ten minutes, stirring occasionally.  after 10 minutes, turn the heat down to low and cook for another 45 minutes.  add salt and pepper 10 minutes before you are done cooking.  this will make a shit load of Sofrito.  you will not use all of it for the rice and beans, but it goes well with most everything, so leftovers are not a problem.

if you are using canned beans, bring to a rolling boil, then reduce heat, and cook until you can smush them between your tongue and the roof of your mouth.  drain them.

once drained

1/2 teaspoon ground Cumin

1 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar

1 1/2 teaspoons Chili powder

salt and pepper to taste

for the rice, 1 cup water.  you should mince the remaining 4 cloves of garlic, and add them to the cooking rice.  also put in 2 tablespoons of olive oil, a big pat of veggie butter, and salt.

This is really good as a side or as a main dish

Here is my brother's recipe for vegetarian mexican lasagna. Next time I make it I will send pics.

mexican lasagna

to serve ~3-4 and a few leftovers

ingredients:

* about 20 corn tortillas
* 1 can black beans
* 1 small can diced tomatoes
* 1 very small can tomato paste
* 1 can black olives
* 1 can corn OR 2 ears corn
* 1 onion
* 1-3 bunches of spinach
* 1 block cheddar cheese

optional:

* ancho peppers
* jalapeÃ±os
* garlic
* 1-2 packages ""soyrizo"" not sure why but it just fits


I've never tried this with real meat but that could work also

Chop up everything except the tortillas and spinach.

Mix together the beans, corn, diced onion, and (optionally) chopped peppers, chopped garlic, and soyrizo in a big bowl.

In a large glass baking dish, and third spinach. Repeat until you can't fit anymore in the dish. (top layer can be the wet bean/tomato mix to avoid the tortillas and spinach getting TOO crispy on top)

bake at 350-400 for 30 minutes or until the end of the world

Top with avocado, hot sauce.

2 tablespoons olive oil

1 onion (diced)

3 large green chiles (roasted, choped)

2-3 teaspoons chile powder (ancho is best)

1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin

1 teaspoon Epazote (mexican oregano)

1 28 oz can diced tomatoes with juice



For the potato and kale filling you will need:

1 pound potatoes (yukon gold or red)

1/2 pound kale washed trimmed and chopped finely

3 tablespoons olive oil

4 cloves garlic

1/2 teaspoon ground cumin

1/4 cup vegetable broth

3 tablespoons lime juice

1/4 cup toasted pepitas (pumpkin seeds)

Salt to taste

you will also need 12-14 corn tortillas


Preheat the oven to 375

in a heavy sauce pan, bring to a simmer, and remove from heat.  when the mixture has cooled enough, taste, and add salt to taste.  then puree in a blender until smooth and even.

for the filling:

peel and dice the tomatoes, keep stirring to cover the kale with oil and garlic, partially cover the pot to steam the kale until it has wilted (4-6 minutes) 

remove the lid and mix in the potatoes, pumpkin seeds, and salt.   with a wooden spoon, mash some of the potatoes.  cook another 3-4 minutes until the stock is absorbed, add more salt and lime juice to taste.

have ready the following: a pie plate filled with 3/4 cups of the sauce, and a lightly greased heated, cast iron skillet.

ladle a little bit of the sauce into the bottom of the casserole dish and spread it around. put a corn tortilla on the skillet for 30 seconds per side until it is softened.  flop the tortilla into the casserole dish and flip it over to completely soak it in the sauce.  then fill the tortilla with the potato and kale filling, saving some sauce for later.  cover tightly with aluminum foil, and bake for 25 minutes.  remove foil and bake for another 10-15 minutes, until the edges of the tortillas sticking out of the sauce are slightly browned.  top individual servings with more sauce, warmed slightly.

Makes 8 cups

1 28-oz can of whole tomatoes (I prefer Muir Glen organic fire-roasted)

1/2 green bell pepper

1/2 white onion

1/4 bunch of cilantro

5 cloves of garlic

1 jalapeno pepper add/or 2 habanero peppers (depending on spice tolerance)

1/4 to 1/3 cup white vinegar

1tbsp chipotle powder

1tsp cayenne pepper

salt and brown sugar to taste

optional: dash of caraway seeds and rosemary



First, garlic, jalapeno and habanero peppers to a 8-cup or larger food processor. Pulse until contents are coarsely chopped. Next, add spices, white vinegar and the entire contents of the canned tomatoes. Pulse lightly. Finally, add the cilantro (I use stems and all) and blend until desired consistency is achieved.

Notice that I have not used any fresh tomatoes. A common mistake is to reach for the fresh tomatoes thinking they'll make your salsa even better. Not true. If you only use fresh tomatoes

Also, not the vinegar. Stick to white vinegar so that the taste stays in the background.",,False,self,t5_2ru7e,False,,

I was thinking it would be cool to come up with a list of important/versatile ingredients to keep around the house to that you can always put together something yummy at a moment's notice.

There are so many great veggie recipes out there, for those of us on a tight budget, even if we had the time to always go shopping for new ingredients, it's hard to afford buying that much variety. 

So

And don't say things like bread, salt &amp; pepper, because I'm assuming people generally have these things around. 

For me

* Quinoa (quinoa salad, breakfasts, etc)
* Orzo pasta (easy warm or cold pasta salad)
* Lemons (dressings on salads
* Tomatoes (salads
* Spinach or other dark green (salads, pizzas)
* Celery (snacks

I'm a poor college student with very little cooking experience (by ""very little experience"" I REALLY mean that. I need a book that doesn't assume I know how to do anything). I have some vegetarian cookbooks that are good

Can you recommend a cookbook that fits these criteria?

* Uses not too many ingredients and cooking equipment (preferably less than 5 ingredients and no more than 2 pots or pans)
* Doesn't use too many unusual ingredients (I'm too poor to constantly go to the store for a random ingredient I might not use that often)
* Optional but very preferable: has color pictures :)
* Has recipes that don't take longer than 30 minutes
* Has a good number of vegan recipes

Thanks in advance!

**Roasted Almond Hummus**

Ingredients:

* garlic cloves
* olive oil
* whole almonds
* canned chickpeas (garbanzo beans) with liquid
* tahini (sesame paste)
* lemon juice
* salt


Directions:

* Roast almonds on a baking sheet in the oven (say 350) until fragrant, almost burnt taste, like coffee has).  Let cool.  I tend to roast large batches and keep them in a plastic container so that I can skip this step when I want hummus.

* Combine garlic

* Add almonds to the the garlic and oil already in the food processor.  Process until thoroughly ground (may take a bit).  Once the mixture has the texture of ground coffee

* Open the cans of chickpeas and drain, lemon juice, salt, and a bit more olive oil (not too much) to the food processor.  Process, drizzling reserved liquid as the mixture combines.  The longer you process it, the smoother it will be.

The final product has a nice, so there's a need for more than liquid than normal.  But olive oil tends to give the hummus a weird texture.  Sometimes it will ""break"" and look like soft cheese.  The reserved chickpea liquid gives a **much** more pleasant texture.",,False,self,t5_2ru7e,False,,

a 9"" bread pan

4 cups of flour

2 cups non-dairy milk

2 teaspoons white vinegar

1 teaspoon salt 

1 teaspoon baking soda


Start off by mixing the ""milk"" and vinegar in a small bowl.  one mixed, and lightly oil the bread pan.  mix the salt flour and baking soda in a big mixing bowl.  once the buttermilk has been created, mix it into the dry ingredients.  stir it and fold it enough so that all ingredients are mixed, but don't overdo the stirring.  the dough should be very sticky.  plop all the dough into the bread pan and with a small knife carve a cross into the top of it. (it's to help it rise don't get your atheist feathers all ruffled) place in the oven for 40-45 minutes.  when you take it out, if you knock on the bottom of the loaf, it should sound hollow.  

this bread is especially good fresh out of the oven (let it cool first) and hosed down with as much Nature Balance or other non-dairy butter as you can pack onto every square inch.  enjoy.
