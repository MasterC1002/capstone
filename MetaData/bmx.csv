I've just been riding it around the past few days. I'm 26 but I figured it's never too late to try something new.

Today I was riding around the downtown area of where I live and saw some bmxers fuckin around by the train station. I've skated my whole life so I know the deal when I see someone else skating...you go say what's up and skate with them. So I went up to them and introduced myself. There was a little bit of a language barrier but the dudes spoke good English. I was asking about the tricks they were doing and if there was a local skatepark to go to. 

They offered to ride over to it (a couple miles away) with me so I could see where it was. We got there and they showed me a lot of tips for a beginner to learn with. It's like they wanted me to do well simply because I had a bike and was trying to get to know new people.

Not really a point to my story...just wanted y'all to know I'm thoroughly impressed with the friendliness of bmxers thus far. People like these guys really give the sport a good name",self,t5_2qjv9,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/bmx/comments/1jaqbe/my_first_real_bmx_sesh/

Well, 360's, bunny hops were decent and my manuals eventually came back when I found the balance of my bike.

The only thing I couldn't land was a barspin...thats only because I wasnt even going to attempt those (paranoid about not catching the bars) before practicing the motion for a few days.

All in all it was a decent day of riding

Good luck fellow riders and im glad to be back in the scene.

1333474397.0,rrg4n,So I'm hella pumped on this reddit passing 1K  subs! I have some things currently in the works for an online contest here to CELEBRATE! Come orn inside.....,n1rvous,20,0,9,"So first off

I'm going to get my buddy Dane aka Ddne here on reddit to handle some of the more html and web designish stuff around here. I asked you guys a little while back what you thought were things to do for this place and I listened so I'm going to run it by him when we meet for some beers later in the week. I'm going to add him to the mod list probably so he can work on it whenever he has time and I don't have to be over his shoulder the whole time. So yeah. Thats that.

**TL;DR** Adding a mod to spruce the place up. He's cool

ANYWHO about the contest. I sent out some emails to a bunch of bmx companies about throwin some free shit to send out to you guys for this lil online contest. **IT'S SPRINGTIME AND EVERYONE SHOULD BE RIDING A GRIPLOAD** so why not capture some pics or vid of it???? 

- **Video Contest**

So basically I'm going to make a post in like sayyyy a month that YOU GUYS will post a comment inside of the self post with a link to like a minute long quick hitter video of you riding/chillen/whatever. It can be longer

Then inside the cool ass people in the subreddit will upvote the ones they are siked on. Highest upvoted...oh

- **Picture Contest**

Same thing basically as the video contest. Post a link, cause that takes wayyy more time to do, but free shit none the less. Honorable mentions and pics that didn't win that got me siked on randomly will get hooked up for sure too with random goodies.

-**FINE PRINT AND RULES. READ THIS SHIT**

So that's basically what I'm doin. Take roughly a month and get some sweet shit. This place is run by YOU guys out there, to come join r/bmx and get in on the free stuff. **MUST BE A MEMBER OF R/BMX TO JOIN ONLINE CONTEST DAWG**. And the pics and vid have to be **YOU** and the winners will have to PROVE IT with a validation pic link message to me after the contest. I'll get in touch. If it isn't you, then SORRY HOMIE, THEM THE RULES! Next in line will win.

I'll warn you like a week or 2 before the actual contest post will be posted up just rehashing everything else out, if you're over 21 and can prove it, I'll send a 4-pack of tall cans of brew if I'm siked on your entry. Why not? BMX and beer go hand in hand in my world.

Any tips or recommendations will be taken into account but I'll have final say on errthing! Questions? Hit up a comment

**UPVOTE THIS TO THE TOP. I GET NO KARMA FOR SELF POSTS BUT WHO CARES ABOUT THAT ANYWAYS??**

SO GET OUT THERE AND GET NASTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",self,t5_2qjv9,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/bmx/comments/rrg4n/so_im_hella_pumped_on_this_reddit_passing_1k_subs/

I used to ride back in 97 to about 2004/05. I was fairly decent for the time. Now I watch clips of riders now and it seems like the level of riding has stepped way up!! which is cool!! i can only attriubute that to being exposed to riding at a young age (i.e. more skateparks everywhere and of course the internet).

I still have my bike

I was mainly into ramps

Pretty much i ALWAYS look at everything from a riders perspective. I cant get the though of pulling a 180 or 360 of off a ledge or grinding a rail out of my head.

Does the community see that as ""this old guy needs to stop trying"" or ""dam thats badass""

**My goal:** I need a hobby outside of computers, though mostly mountain bikes.

**Some basic info about me:** 23 years old as of march. 175cm tall
Location: Eastern suburbs of Melbourne

**Questions:** I want to slowly start saving up for a good bmx bike. Not sure what exactly the types are called but something I can take out on the streets, but not too expensive. Say I could try saving up around $1k AUD for a good bike that will last me.
What size should I be looking at? What brands? What types? Colour is obviously a personal preference so I'll get to it once I have an idea on what I have to look for. Anything else I need to look out for?

Once I get a feel of the bike and adjust to it over a few weeks once I get it, I most likely wouldn't feel comfortable going there by myself, so I would most likely try to get a friend to go with me anyway.

If anyone reading this happens to be a local
And if you do happen to be a local, I'd like to get to know some locals... boost my self esteem up etc.

I probably have missed something in here that I was meant to ask before

Cheers guys.

**Edit:** (Knew this would happen very soon). Are there any community sites/forums for Melbournians that I could join and have a read over and communicate with other locals?

**Edit 2 (23/06/2012):** I've found this website here that lists bikes for sale from all different shops in AUS. http://www.bikeexchange.com.au/
So thanks to all your feedback I have a very small idea about what I should be looking at

The bike is a 20"" wheel kid's BMX bike. It is too small for an adult!

**Subject:** Re: Bike - $60
**Attachment:** [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/s3i95PR.png)

Bless your heart! Thank you for your concern, and rode a total of four 20"" wheel BMX bikes. I'm lucky in that I am 5'8"" and 160lbs today as I was the last time I rode a bike 13 years ago.

You may also be interested to know that modern BMX bikes are drastically different than the bikes manufactured more than 8 years ago like yours. Due to the different handlebars, seat post, and frame dimensions, new riders (kids) are not looking for bikes like yours. The old bikes and the new bikes feel and ride totally different. Your most likely buyer will be someone who is already used to the way your bike rides and feels. i.e. someone who rode a BMX more than 8 years ago.

I would rather have a classic BMX bike than the $60 in my wallet, I am willing to meet half way.

See you soon?

Ive got some questions!!

What companies are good now? When I rode Odyssey was a joke and Hoffman Bikes were top notch and made in America.

What is a good online shop? The only one I know of is Danscomp.

Can anyone recommend a good wheel set that isnt too expensive? I'd like to run a left  drive bike

So it has been quite some time since I have been on a BMX bike.  probably 6 years.  I still skateboard about once a week

Regardless, as I am pretty comfortable on it after 11 years...but I'd like to get back into it a little bit.

So, super low seats.  I get that it stays out of the way, but I remember that the seat was used heavily (knees squeezing the seat) for things like no handers and bar spins.  Do a lot of people just learn to do it without holding the seat?  Or perhaps just mid air?

I also notice a complete absence of gyros on new bikes.  More like a racing bike set up

I've also notice a TON of plastic parts.  Again

These are just a few questions I have,False,self,t5_2qjv9,False,,,t3_11yyx7
