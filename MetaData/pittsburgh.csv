I figured it was gone for good, and I started looking into replacing it (I also told my wife at this point).  Well, I got a call yesterday from PWSA trying to set up a time to meet there to search again, I was hesitant and felt like I'd be wasting their time, but they insisted.  We planned to meet this afternoon, probably around 1pm, and they'd call to let me know.  
I received a call around 12:00, they told me they had it and asked where they could bring it (they delivered it downtown), and when they dropped it off, they refused any reward.  
They explained that they tried going down in there yesterday, when they easily could have ignored my requests, especially since it was 100% my fault that it happened.  I've seen a number of posts on this subreddit talking about how nice the people are in Pittsburgh, and I just had to share this story, reinforcing that truth.

1363030216.0,1a3jig,TIL: spot delivery scams are fraudulent and illegal. A warning to anyone buying a car in PGH,saraquael,135,13,43,"This is a text post because I don't want any karma

Two weeks ago, went through financing, was approved, signed the papers and drove the car off the lot the same day. She'd given them an almost 30% down payment on the vehicle, too. Everything was gravy. Then on Friday (of course, the day before the weekend, right?) the dealership left a message telling her that her financing had fallen through

So she called Saturday, so she goes from job site to job site, working for different contracting companies. She had had a couple days off between jobs, but she definitely wasn't ""unemployed."" She had also discussed this with the salesman, who had told her that he sold to union people all the time and it wasn't a problem due to the nature of the business, blah blah. Anyway, the finance guy then went on to tell her that the loan company was pushing them to repo the car

She said she'd call her loan company Monday morning to sort it out. Well he then made it sound like the repo trucks were already out looking for the car (funny how it went from a possibility to impending doom in 30 seconds). He tried to push her into coming in immediately so they could, he didn't answer and didn't call her back. 

Monday morning, they had just needed to verify her employment. All they needed was a phone number for their records. She called Spitzer back and spoke to the finance guy again. She deliberately didn't mention having called her loan company, just to see what the guy would say now. 

Once again,"" Scumbag Finance Guy said. ""Your union sent a letter to the loan company saying you aren't employed, and so the loan was denied. Loan buyers can pull funding at any time."" This is an outright lie - three of them, in fact. Her loan was still approved: the loan company had only been looking for a phone number to verify; no one had sent any letters from the union (she checked; the union doesn't even verify employment); and she had already gone back to work on another job. She was fortunate enough that she had the money to pay off the entire balance of the car loan if needed, but she still called a lawyer just in case.

Most people don't know that this is illegal. ""Spot Delivery, often weeks later, that their financing had fallen through. They then ""yo-yo"" the buyer back into the dealership, telling them that they'll have to finance at a higher interest rate, pay penalties and fees, and/or give the dealership more money to avoid repossession on a car they've already been approved to buy. This is a predatory tactic because they know that, after a few weeks, as the dealership pretends to be sympathetic to the buyer's plight. Dealerships tend to use this tactic on young people and people who have bad credit

**Don't fall for it. If you signed purchase documents and registration applications and if you obtained insurance for the vehicle, and the RISC (Retail Installment Sales Contract) is binding. In addition, they're legally required to find you financing at the same (or better) interest rate if your financing falls through. Period.

I didn't know any of this until today, but [Kimmel &amp; Silverman](http://www.lemonlaw.com/spotdelivery.html) (think: 1-800 Lemon Law commercials) were awesome and will represent you for free. They also have a lot of info on their site about this type of fraud and helpful tips on what to do. They're the reason my friend didn't get scammed out of any money. 

And what do you know? As soon as she mentioned that she had a lawyer and wasn't paying a penny more

**TL;DR: Once you sign the paperwork, or ask you for any more money because the contract you signed is legal and binding. And if they do, they're scamming you and you should call a lawyer and tell that dealership to eat a thick stack of dicks.**",,False,,t5_2qhrn,,http://www.reddit.com/r/pittsburgh/comments/1a3jig/til_spot_delivery_scams_are_fraudulent_and/

People have pointed out that you can go to the City Paper, or a handful of other websites to get all of these show listings. I use all of those along with venue pages, blogs, and social media to round up everything. No list is perfect, this one isn't either, I'm just trying to bring together a what's happening in Pittsburgh music for the week post.

Last week I mentioned that I didn't include the Justin Bieber concert on this calendar and someone said that I should include every show including those of bands that I don't like. I'd just like to point out that I'm not familiar with the majority of these bands and I try to post everything I can. I skipped Bieber last week because I didn't think his music was geared towards this community. I went ahead and included things like Carrie Underwood and Twiztid this week though and I won't filter out concerts in the future.

I'm going to miss shows here and there

I would like to make these posts on Mondays and list shows all the way through Sunday. I'd also like to include recently announced shows so that people can plan ahead.

Pedestrian vs. Car rage is nothing new at the intersection near my house, and hear someone yelling ""Call 911"" and traffic backing up.   

So I throw on shoes and run down the stairs.   Find half a dozen people in the street, and the driver of the car is on the phone in hysterics.  

Traffic is stopped heading towards Forbes on Wightman, so I start directing traffic.   Another bystander helps with the other direction of traffic so we can actually get people across Wightman as we need to.   

Realize that this is within 60 seconds of the pedestrian being hit: there's a doctor tending to him, offering assistance/blankets/water if anyone needs it.  While I was directing traffic, a physician is driving by, asks if we need help (I tell her yes, not knowing the guy who is already helping the guy's qualifications) and stops and helps a bit.  

The first responders (big fire truck) show up within about 3 minutes

Beyond being a bit traumatized by the experience (which is part of why I'm sharing)

- Within 60 seconds of this guy getting hit
- There were at least 2
- Our emergency services are awesome

The car in front of me makes his legal left turn with the green arrow as the cop pulls out and almost hits the guy. Cop turns on his flashers and pulls the car over right in front of the US Steel Building. My arrow is still green, and after a bit more chatting I left.

I feel terrible that I just drove away without getting the Cops' names, but if the guy that got pulled over got a ticket, it was truly the most bullshit ticket ever. 

I know its an off chance that the person who got pulled over is a redditor

I'm hoping the cops just let him off

***TL;DR: Saw cops run a light and almost hit a person making a legal left turn. They pulled him over and were taking his license when I stopped to speak up. They thanked me but I left without getting any information (like a moron). If it was you that got pulled over yesterday, I'll help.***

I didn't have as much time to explore the city as I wanted to. Turned out the NHL draft was so much fun I spent a lot of time there. What I did do was go down to the strip district and eat GOOD. Like Rowdy_Roddy_Pipper said I can see most of the attraction would be to go shopping at all the incredible grocery stores and cooking the food late

I must say the people of Pittsburgh are some of the nicest I've ever met. Everyone just wanted to talk and be helpful. Even at the Consol Energy Center wearing my Tampa Bay jersey nobody gave me shit unlike other fans have. Just polite banter. Really classy people.

I will be back because there's a lot I see that I missed out on. I wish I made it to Squirrel Hill

I have ONE gripe. Walking back to my hotel (I love that the city is so walkable) I tried to buy beer at a 7-11 and then a liquor store. Can you not do this there??? Someone told my I'd have to go to a bar to buy a case. Definitely not a deal breaker just very interesting.

Meetup point can be in front of the Fort Pitt Block House:

DOUBLE EDIT:

Resources for printables can be found at http://www.restorethefourth.net/resources/
Currently I have 100 of their trifold designs

You may want to bring your own sign, and comfortable shoes. 

There are lots of great threads on how to prepare on /r/restorethefourth so make sure you check that out too.

All of these occurred while I was delivering.

Incident 1: tl;dr ""I'm in a hurry! I'll go first

While approaching an intersection with an island isolated right turn lane with a yield sign, pulls around me and speeds off in front of the ambulance. 

Incident 2: tl;dr playing chicken with an ambulance.

I was driving on a two lane, and as I saw the ambulance approaching within 3 car lengths of the truck, I pull off to which the truck uses as an opportunity to pass me *and then* pull off for the ambulance. 

Incident 3: tl;dr He's not turning *my* direction

I made a left turn onto a 4 lane road with a speed limit of 35, they were some 100-150 yards back. As I approached the right turn, there is an ambulance coming the opposite direction in the left lane. Seeing as though we are approaching a small intersection, I pull off just before the entrance to which the car behind me ignores and flies right on by, just as the ambulance is making it's left turn into the complex. The ambulance was forced to hit his brakes to give way to the car that didn't care. This is the worst in my opinion as it is exemplary of a very short sighted selfishness; would you want the ambulance that you called to save you or a loved one's life held up by someone who is just in too much of a hurry to get out of the way?

This is unacceptable. I imagine one can get a ticket for not pulling off for emergency vehicles

I witness all sorts of careless, but this takes the cake. No where else that I have lived or driven in is it even a question of whether or not to pull off for emergency vehicles. Please, Pittsburgh, this needs to stop.

1341423037.0,w1ey0,Trying to open an arcade in the city of Pittsburgh - Here's an update on things.,MagicPantsMachine,91,10,79,"Hi everyone

A while back I had posted about how my fiancée and I were trying to open an arcade in Pittsburgh. I wanted to give a little update to everyone to let people know where we stand and what is going on.

We have the equipment. Actually we just drove eight or so hours for a Point Blank machine. Getting all of the rigs working is very hard work. I can't tell you how many crimp connectors we've gone through. But at last we have some games that I think everyone will enjoy.

Unfortunately, they make opening an arcade as one would have in the 80's or 90's impossible.


&gt;§ 777.05 - LICENSE FEES.

&gt;(a) The annual fee for the issuance of a license to maintain a mechanical or electronic amusement device that is
&gt;not a ride or a juke box or an electro mechanical gambling device shall be two hundred nine dollars ($209.00).
&gt;
&gt;(f) The quarterly license fee for amusement arcades containing six (6) or more licensed mechanical or electronic
&gt;amusement devices shall be seven hundred forty-six dollars ($746.00). This fee shall be due on or before
&gt;January 1, and October 1 of the current year.


The $746 quarterly ($2984 annually) is pretty bad. There is no feasible way for us to take 15 or 20 arcade cabinets (to start) that make 25 cents a play and make a profit on this. We were actually going to be taking a loss on things before

The thing that absolutely crushes us though is the license fee per machine. It appears that in addition to the $746 quarterly fee and the mercantile license needed to maintain a place like that, is $209 a pop. So, if we have 20 cabinets, that means we have to pay $4180 a year in taxes just for this law.

Worst part? The feest just went up. It's now $800 quarterly ($3,100 total on 20 machines) . So look at it this way:

If we have 40 people enter the shop every day and they each play 8 games (which is actually being a bit pragmatic, electricity, or the maintenance on the machines.

Even that has a lot of variables. In a shop with 20 arcade machines, say, an old Galaga machine that gets 4 or so plays every day. Then, even if it's played every day for those four times, it will never makes the funds necessary to be worth it. This is sad, because a lot of the old, unpopular machines are my favorites.

We are going to go talk to a lawyer in a bit to see what we can do about this. Unfortunately


&gt;§ 777.01 - LICENSE REQUIRED; EXCEPTION.
&gt;
&gt;(a) No proprietor shall set up, exhibit, display
&gt;or maintain on the premises of a business establishment within the city
&gt;profit
&gt;otherwise used for the purpose of amusement or entertainment by the insertion therein of any currency or a coin
&gt;or any other metal disc
&gt;shall be paid for each machine. This provision shall be applicable to proprietors who charge fees for the use of
&gt;pool tables on their premises although such pool tables do not operate through the insertion of currency
&gt;metal disc
&gt;
&gt;(b) This Chapter is not applicable to devices
&gt;playing one (1) game is less than five cents ($0.05).


So this is interesting. I think what it's saying is that all of these laws and regulations are only applicable if the cabinet itself takes money, pay something at the door? I'm not sure if I'm reading it right, but maybe someone else can let me know if that's what they think it says. If we did have people pay something at the door, then we may have to pay the Allegheny County Amusement Tax, but I think we're okay there. It's just that massive fee on each cabinet.

The funny thing is that I don't think any places over the county line have these weird laws.

Anyway, and that can't be too bad, right? Except for the fact that I'm horrible at Street Fighter, and that seems to be all he wants to play :P",,False,,1341423345.0,t3_w1ey0

* Re:        Bomb Threats
* Date:        April 3


Very early this morning
Litchfield Towers
Science Center was made.  These were the third and fourth bomb threats targeting
Pitt buildings to be received in less than twenty-four hours and the tenth and
eleventh to be received in recent weeks.  Each of these threats has been disruptive
– requiring the evacuation of facilities
other important work and
students to leave their residence hall rooms in the middle of the night.

Each threat has been taken seriously
Careful searches of each evacuated building
the University and from other area police departments
any explosives of any kind at any site.  We are thankful for that result and are
deeply grateful for the help we have received
pressing forward with the ongoing investigation
agencies.  In fact
many significant costs resulting from these threats – that limited police resources
have been reallocated from other pressing matters to be invested in the security of
this campus.

The inability to bring this succession of threats to a quick end obviously is a
source of frustration for everyone whose life has been disrupted by them.  But I can
assure you that law enforcement professionals are doing everything they can to
pursue all possible leads.  And
police work and related efforts being undertaken within the University itself
have offered a very substantial reward for information leading to the arrest and
conviction of those responsible for these crimes.

Even without the motivation that might be provided by a reward
the University community to be especially attentive to any unusual activity and to
share any relevant information with the University of Pittsburgh Police. 
Representatives of the Department can be reached by phone at (412) 624-2121 or by
email at police@pitt.edu
. 

Particularly given last month’s shootings at the Western Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic and recent reminders of violence on other campuses
these threats not only lack basic respect for the thousands of people whose lives
have been disrupted by them but must possess a heartless streak.  When those
responsible are apprehended
full extent of the law.  Until then
maintain safety as our priority and do our best to cope with whatever further
disruptions may come our way.",,t5_2qhrn,False,,Brookline,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/pittsburgh/comments/rsgni/we_could_use_pittsburghs_help/

I believe that it is important for Congress to examine and address the presence of illegal, introduced by Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX), does not properly target online piracy and could have serious consequences for existing and new websites and technologies on the Internet.



What concerns me most about this legislation is that it would target the Internet's domain name system, thereby punishing even those outlets that didn't commit a crime.



I am also concerned that websites which carry user-generated content might be wrongfully punished.  The owners of these sites are often unaware of the kinds of content that individual users upload to them.  Yet under this legislation



Importantly, I believe it is important to continue to protect innovation and the basic framework of the Internet, and therefore to develop a more targeted approach against piracy than the Stop Online Piracy Act provides.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to create targeted solutions to deter the availability of such content.



As you might know, the Protect IP Act.  That legislation was introduced by Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT).  As Congress continues to deliberate the topic of online piracy, please be assured that I will continue to work with my colleagues to protect against Internet piracy in a balanced and targeted manner.



Thank you again for contacting me about this important issue.  Please do not hesitate to get in touch with me again if I can be of assistance to you in the future.

Final edit: So here's pretty much the story. A local gun shop owner decided to give away an AR-15 in a contest as a protest against the Obama Assault Weapon Ban that is in congress at the moment. The Pittsburgh Tactical Firearms Facebook Page decided to promote the raffle and the fact that this guy is giving away tons of free assault weapon stuff along with it. TB responded by bashing the give away saying that it was stupid. Queue the response from the facebook page to go after Benz and everyone else in the thread on the X Site.

I just self-published my own book about this city 2 weeks ago and I've been nervously debating whether or not I want to put it out there for my fellow redditors. I'm nervous but hopeful the quality of the book will speak for itself. 

It's available in both Kindle and Paperback format. I'm not going to spoil anything

I am very proud of this

However, do you want one?"" you say YES. Here is why. Now, I'm doing this from memory, so I may not have every detail exact, but the general tenor is correct.

I was standing behind a woman waiting to input my car details and pay for my parking. She finished up and left the kiosk right after the screen says ""You're done, not knowing what to do. The woman is long gone and the screen is still there. It seems like nothing is happening. Is it ready for me to input my license? I have to get back to that screen.

So

To my surprise and chagrin it did not cancel me only out of the CURRENT screen, and if a meter guy/woman came along, input the license plate, it wouldn't have shown up in the database has having been paid. (And I assume her credit card was not charged.) Basically I unintentionally dicked her over. 

The solution to this is always request the optional receipt. Once it prints out,"" and you leave, the guy behind you might be waiting--I dunno, 30 seconds? a minute?--staring at that screen. Most people are impatient and will press the ""cancel"" button, I presume. When they do this, your entire transaction is canceled and you might get a ticket. But printing the receipt will always circumvent this issue.

* One person yelling at me to get off the road.
* Three people passing me so close I could touch their cars.
* Having to slam on my brakes to not hit a person making a ""Pittsburgh Left"" in front of me.
* Four people driving cars in a bike lane.
* One person tailgating me closer than a car length because I was only traveling 27 mph on a 25 mph road and there wasn't room for the person to pass me.

And while I don't normally see as many of these things on a single ride

This is why I find it very difficult to find sympathy with all of the people complaining about cyclists on the road.  There are lots of automobile drivers out there who are actively endangering my life on a daily basis.  This is what I mean by the statement that automobile drivers are often worse than the cyclists on the road.

While I pedantically try to follow state law on my daily commute I can certainly sympathize with the cyclists who don't follow the letter of the law so that they can avoid interactions with automobiles (though I have few sympathies for the people who ignore the rules altogether).",,t5_2qhrn,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/pittsburgh/comments/1kiem7/why_i_say_that_auto_drivers_are_just_as_bad_or/

Major League Bocce - Pittsburgh, has officially arrived in Pittsburgh for its inaugural season for Spring 2013!! If you like playing with balls, drinking, or a combination of both then check us out!



The inaugural Spring season officially opens in Pittsburgh on April 30th and will conclude on June 18th. All of the games will be played on **Tuesdays at 6:30pm** at **the Point** in downtown with a trip to our local sponsor bar (TBD) to follow.

EDIT: formatted to make it more readable as this was originally posted from a phone.

EDIT 2: I know some of you had questions regarding what qualifies as ""adequate"" health insurance. I did some more research and follow up with our corporate office regarding what qualifies as ""adequate"" health insurance for players. Even if a player does not have insurance, Major League Bocce will not be liable in any way. So if your friends would want to join, they are more than welcome to and we would be happy to have them! They just need to understand that by checking that box, they are agreeing to waive Major League Bocce of any legal liability in the very minimal chance of injury.
