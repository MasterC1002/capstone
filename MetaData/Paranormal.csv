There's a list like this that's been floating around the 'net for some time, I know) categorised for readability. I thought I should post it somewhere, and reddit is semi-permanent, so here goes. Note that some articles are more interesting or bizarre than creepy. Please contribute, and enjoy your sleepless night(s).

P.S. Apologies if there's a subreddit better suited for this; I'm not a regular so wasn't sure. Is not being addicted to reddit considered paranormal?

1359150773.0,17a3e5,My strangest paranormal experience. Disney. ,welltheresthat,301,42,58,"I have had several paranormal experiences throughout my 23 years of life. This one

Back story.

I worked at Walt Disney World for four years. Most days

This experience happened at work, you would complete one layer, go up or down the stairs, complete the other layer, and go up or down the stairs again. The main goal of our ""set"" was to see every guest in the restaurant at least once. Also, there is only one way in/out for guests, down that ramp there. 

The greatest part about working at this restaurant was the final set of the night. Usually, or we would get time to play around in the restaurant and have fun. 

Experience begins!

It is the last set of the night, two began up, two began down. I started up and greeted the family on the top section. I completed the circle, and was about to go down my set of stairs, when I saw the back of a man's head sitting just to the right of the stairs I was about to descend. Well, I had to greet everyone in the restaurant one last time, so I came up to his table

He serenely (yes, and grinned widely. He didn't have a drink, a place-setting, and was not wearing a name-tag (like a manager would). Instead, he grasped the menu of the restaurant in his hands, and laid it carefully onto the table when I waved.

""Why, slick hair, and was wearing a long sleeve button down shirt, with a vest over it, and a tie. He also had a mustache, with an otherwise clean shaven face. I thought it was cool that an adult male knew which chipmunk he was talking to, usually no one knows Chip from Dale. 

Again, and put his hands back on the menu, picking it up.

I pointed to the menu, asking ""Are you hungry?""/""Are you eating?"" It was odd, because it looked like he had just been seated for dinner...but the restaurant would be closing in about 15 minutes, and stopped seating new guests about 30 minutes ago.

The man laughed, ""Oh no, nothing for me today, Dale."" 

I nodded

He spoke to me again.

""I'm just here to check up on things. See how they are going."" 

I looked back at him, and touched my arm. Through the fur, I felt 'static', and a swift feeling of pride. 

""Go say 'hi' to the children down there. The restaurant is closing."" 

Again, I signaled to him. I pointed at my chest, and put my finger to the table. ""I'll be back."" He nodded, ""Alright, Dale"" and picked up the menu.

I went down the stairs and rounded to the other side of the restaurant, ""Found you, Dale!"", took me by the arm, and went to guide me back inside. I gave her the ""one second"" sign, and ran back to the other side of the restaurant, to find the man again. 

There was no one there. The menu was still in the middle of the table

No one had walked out behind me while I was on the other side with the families, nor did he have a name tag on.

I went through the backstage door, ""The dad with the kids?"", and head shaking. 

When I went home that night, I would have recognized him, surely, and Walt never actually saw Epcot. Which leads me now to believe I met an imagineer, or some other sort of operator. 

It boggles me

Every now and then I start trying to look into Disney's past and find photos of someone I might recognize. No luck yet

I always make a point now when I'm on a Disney vacation to visit the Land, I feel like I will see him again.

* There is no mirror behind them.

1369678223.0,1f5d5n,Conclusive proof of Reincarnation ??!! Please help...this is FREAKING ME OUT .,gregclark1,279,53,151,"In June 2003 while working as Development Producer for a TV company I came up with the idea of doing a documentary on reincarnation. I found a psychic who claimed she could discover past-lives. In order to prove the process I gave her pictures of myself. She would do the rest.
A few days later she gave me written details of three past lives. One detailed a life just before WW2 where I was working underwater in a ""machine"" I was happy but then something happened and I was trapped. We weren't attacked. (She was insistent this had happened just before the war) but it was an accident. I was trapped for many hours. The rescue party were above us but they couldn't get to us. We all died. She wrote that she saw the word Thesis floating on the water.
This was strange, half drowning I gave up and went back. An officer and a group of crew were waiting on me. I had tried my best, I was commended for it, but I could see the intense worry and panic growing in their eyes. I was sent back to my bunk to rest. I was finding it hard to breathe, the air was so thick, hot and wet...The dream ended here.
Maybe this was the reason I looked up submarine sinkings around 1939 I don't know, not Thesis, that sunk in Liverpool bay on its maiden sea trials on the 1st of June 1939.
During routine drills one of the torpedo hatches was opened accidentally causing her to flood and sink. Rescue teams were soon upon it but they didn't receive authorisation from the Admirality to carry out the rescue. This was immediately pre-war and the submarine was classified. The delay was fatal. Exactly 100 people died. Many attempts were made by the men to abandon ship but the Davis escape hatch broke and only two men managed to get out. It was a scandal.
Now there is a lot of information on the Thetis accident now on the Internet but in 2003 when the Internet was still in its infancy there was none. She could have happened upon this story and fed it to me but I was fairly confident the psychic didn't have the research skills needed. (Plus when I had suggested a submarine. She said she'd thought - being ignorant of military history - that she didn't think submarines were around then
I told the psychic I didn't know what do with this information. It was intriguing but not conclusive. She said I'd have to work through karma associated with the sinking and that it would need equalised in this life. The opposed of the tragedy would need to happen.The idea was a bit far fetched. And more importantly the process wasn't visual enough for TV so the idea joined the 99% of rejected TV ideas.
Now this is where its gets increasingly bizarre. Two years later I'm working for the BBC, but I didn't hold out much hope. To my surprise the programme was commissioned immediately by the BBC and I was soon helping make the documentary called SUB RESCUE.
details below
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/4128614.stm http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/01_january/04/sub.shtml
It was a great story. Russia had put up an international rescue call for the trapped submarine The PRIZ. The Russian rescue attempt had proven futile. The men had less than 48 hrs worth of oxygen left. The U.S , Kamchatka to rescue the men with only hours oxygen to spare. The British led the mission with some American assistance having arrived in Russia first.
As I researched how the men had survived and the oxygen preservation techniques needed when trapped on a submarine. I thought it a strange coincidence that here I was researching a case what was the polar opposite of what my supposed past life had been. In mine bureacracy had killed the 100 men of the Thetis. With the Priz red tape had been cast aside and quick decision making had a near impossible mission possible.
For the documentary we decided to arrange a meeting with the men. The Russians had never met the British crew so we took Stuart Gold and Commander Riches back to Petropavlovsk to meet with Cpt Miloshevsky and the rest of the crew.
It was an emotional night that will stay with me for the rest of my life. The Russians thanked the men for saving their lives and for the ability to see their children grow up.
But one thing bothered them....The young Russian Captain Miloshevsky asked Stuart Gold via an Interpreter why it was the British and not the Americans
Stuart Gold bent down and opened up his bag. In it contained the publicitly booklet for the British Submarine Rescue system. He open the booklet to the first page 
I was astounded. Here was someone pointing at the same picture of the Thetis that I had looked at 5 years previously. Here was someone independent of me telling a third party, possibly? But whatever belief system I have I truly cannot explain these events rationally.
Some people have glibly mentioned coincidence
To explain this rationality I would need to include odds that are so astronomical they become irrational. They would need to become a faith system held by an irrational faith in the rational. And that is something I cannot do.......
So can anyone else help me explain this???
I swear that everything above its 100 percent True to the facts.

My mother was pregnant with me and I was going to be my parent's first child. They lived in a house that was a decent size in Sandy Hook, but my dad was a carpenter so he decided to put an addition onto the house before I was born to make more room in case they wanted more children down the road. Being a carpenter, my dad had a lot of tools and basically did the whole addition by himself.

One day while working on the addition, one by one they would all start disappearing day after day with no real explanation. When I was born, my dad had basically replaced every tool he owned with a new one by the time the addition was finally done.

Part 1 of the weird stuff that happened: After my mom gave birth to me and was good to leave the hospital my parents came home to put me in my brand new room that my dad had just built. Shockingly, but it gets weirder.
This whole incident freaked my parents out and they would tell the story to friends, my parents reluctantly agreed to have the ""spirit lady"" as my mom calls her, come by.

As soon as she entered the house, he understood and returned the tools. Cato kind of became a fun excuse for us in the family any time the remote went missing or something fell off the counter. ""Cato didn't want you to change the channel"" my mom would say. It was kind of freaky but nothing paranormal ever happened after the tool incident. It was kind of cool to think that we had a friendly ghost in the house watching over us.

We moved out of that house in 1997 to the Boston area not knowing whether or not the story about Cato was true. However, my house was chosen to be part of it. She sent us the reports and it all made us take a step back. They found an ""X"" on part of the chimney base which traces back to homes built by former slaves as well as a shoe under kitchen floorboards which was believed to prevent evil from entering the house. Even more striking was that the historians believed the house to be built by a man by the name Cato Freedom, a runaway slave. I havent been back by that house since I left but I would love to have the chance to go check it out.

I have been living in a rural, I used to ride my ATV on the trails.  As I grew older, I'd take girls for ""walks"" in the woods.  As I grew older, still, the house was passed down to me, and became my own.  What I'm getting at here, is that I know the five-square mile hunk of woods behind my house like the back of my own hand.  
  
Just for fun, but I could always find my way back to familiar territory by locating some type of game trail, ATV trail, tree that I remember from 2006, basically any of one of the thousands of reference points that I have in these woods.  That's extremely important to know for my story.  I haven't gotten lost in those woods in the last ten years, except last Sunday.  
  
It was the 17th of February, so when I stepped outside in my usual heavy jacket/ sweater combo, I started sweating.  It was close to 50F, outside, so I stripped my jacket off and left it on a chair in my den (Yeah, I'm kind of fat.)  After I took the first few dozen steps, I remembered that I had left my cell phone in my jacket pocket.  I was thinking about turning around to get it, and once when I get in the trees my reception is spotty
  
So I start walking on the main trail that leads, old trees that are isolated in the backyard, itself).  I made this trail with a four-wheeler and a bunch of spare time when I was a kid. I made it connect to the one, huge trail that everyone else would ride on.  I continue walking my regular path, and my trail starts to take me into the woods.  If I continue straight, it will take me to the main trail.  If I head right it takes me to a trail that I made that runs parallel, and real close
  
I continue straight to the main trail, if you get my drift.  Not literally, I mean.  It's just everyone's 4-wheeler trail that they use when the kids from out-of-town are over, and no one else gets upset because it's not in their back yard.  However, I'm the only person who walks it 2-3 times a day.  
  
My dog (A Brittney Spaniel), we keep walking down the main trail.  There's a few trails that branch off to the sides, but I know where every single one goes, and only one deviates from the main trail and goes to someone else's house about 1.5km away.  Right before that is my trail that runs parallel to my property, that I mentioned earlier.  
  
I'm not going to sit here and lie to you, the moment I turn down to trail to go home, she takes off trotting and gets home about five minutes before me.  I don't know why she does it, but she does.  Just as I'm turning onto the trail, watching my dog disappear into the woods in front of me I caught movement out of the left side of my vision.  Thinking that it was a deer, squirrel, fox, coyote, I casually cocked my head and immediately stopped.  
  
My neighbor's eighteen year-old kid is standing not twenty feet away from me, I can't take it anymore and shout his name at him.  No response.  
  
My head started swimming, vividly.
 
I looked back at him, or god knows what.  I've got a Taurus Judge loaded with 3"" .410 Hollowpoint Slugs and 2 1/2"" .410 PDX Shells, so I think I'm fine.*-.  Sorry.  He didn't make one sound in the process of turning around.  He would have had to of made some type of noise.  Me trying to walk stealthily in the woods still makes a few twig pops and leave rustles.  I had only turned my head for what felt like two seconds.  In order to turn around that fast, we would have made a bunch of noise.  His head was still down.  
  
This is, just thinking about it;  I'm a twenty-six year old man.  I felt something tug.  When I write the word ""tug"" I want to write it in all caps.  I've never felt anything like it before.  It was the opposite of what you would sometimes feel as you drift off to sleep; That feeling of weightlessness.  This was the exact, terrible opposite.  It felt like I was falling out.  I can't f--king explain it.  I'm sorry.
 
When I opened my eyes, but not in the sense that it was suddenly overcast, or the the sun had went down.  It felt like a solar eclipse.  I couldn't even sense where the sun was coming from.  There was a little more snow on the ground than there had been before.  I don't remember why that sticks out to me, it must be because I'm associating it with the fog.  It was slightly foggy that day from the snow melting, but I couldn't see more than twenty meters out, now.  
  
It felt like the woods were alive with something that did not want me there, because trees don't slightly shift from side to side.  
  
I stood there looking around for about thirty or forty seconds.  I was completely petrified.  This wasn't the place that I had grown up living at.  This wasn't even someplace that I felt I was supposed to go.  ""Alien"" pops up in my head when I think about this.  Everything felt alien.  When I finally tried to take a step
 
I was back on the trail heading to my house.  My neighbor was standing in front of me, but was finally able to kind of choke something out as I extended my hand out to give him a handshake.  He didn't notice anything out of the ordinary.  At this point I started feeling sick.  
  
I remember the kid asking me if I was alright.  He said I looked pale
  
I saw something out of my peripheral vision.  It was my dog
  
Picture you're somewhere with a friend of yours that you know likes to joke around a lot.  In mid-conversation, times a hundred.  It felt like the kid had suddenly tried to attack me, but my eyes didn't register anything.  I put my arms up, in defense as I started to step back.  Before I took a step, I realized I was somewhere else.  I was about ten minutes down the trail, at the point where it would connect to ""my"" trail.  I jumped again, in shock.  
  
I looked around.  It felt like I should look around for something, and I only smoke 2 or 3 a day.  I've burned through a pack since Sunday.)  After smoking half the cigarette, my dog came trotting down the trail, coming from out of the woods.  Not from the direction of the house.  How did I get ahead of my dog?  
 
Then I threw up a couple times.  I felt dirty.  I rushed down the trail to my house, and I could figure everything out with him.
  
When he finally got home, and I think he was starting to understand how I was feeling about what had just happened.  He tried his best to reassure me that I wasn't crazy, but I still felt like I had budding schizophrenia, or something.  
  
We finally decided on a course of action.  He was going to wait for our third roommate to get there in about an hour, and ask to talk to their kid.  He was going to hint if anything funny happened, and then he was going to relay the information to me.  A few fingers of whiskey and a few smokes later, my other roommate finally arrived and went into her room to get changed and take a shower.  She didn't even notice that I was staring at a television that wasn't on, getting drunk and smoking cigarettes at six in the evening.  Then again, she isn't one of the most attentive people that I've met in my life.  
  
Finally my roommate comes back and looks shocked.  He sits down next to me and starts telling me the story.  He walked over to the house, except for his kids two cars and the broken down Monte that's been sitting there since I was a kid.  After waiting for almost a minute, he told me, the door opened a little bit.  Only about three or four inches, he told me.  He said, ""Hello?"" to the cracked door, and reached his hand out to push it open, the door opened quickly, the door slammed shut in his face.  He started ringing the doorbell and pounding on the door like a madman.  He tried the knob
  
Finally, due to an unfortunate accident, so there is always someone there looking after her.  My friend asked if the kid was home, and she said that he hadn't gotten dropped off from work yet, saying that his car was broke down.  
  
That's all the information that my friend has relayed to me.  He doesn't want to talk about it much, because he's been my best friend since for the last twenty years, and is the closest thing to a brother that I've got.  
  
This has been screwing with my brain for the entire week.  I don't know what to do, but I have to admit, so am I.  I'm at my wits end, Reddit.  What the f--k happened?  We've seen the next-door neighbor's kid, since then, but we haven't had a chance to talk to him.  We've just seen him coming down the road with his car.  
  
I'm hoping someone here can help me with this.  I don't even know what to do.  Right now
 
TL;DR - I took my dog for a walk.  Saw my neighbor's kid acting weird in the middle of the woods.  Almost ""blacked-out"" and woke up several minutes down the trail

I'm home alone today.  Both roommates are at work and my boyfriend, but I brushed it off.  I heard some thumping in my room, which sounded like my dog wagging her tail against my furniture.



I got out of the bathroom and checked my phone, and that I answered, which I didn't.  I called her back, and she said yes, I did answer.  ""We"" spoke for about two minutes.  She says I sounded like myself, but maybe with a sore throat.  She says I promised to make some soup and take it easy.



I grabbed my dog


**UPDATE**



Here are some answers to some general questions:

If my dog had seen a stranger, though, she would have hurt him.  When I came out of the bathroom, she was acting pretty normal.

I honestly do not know if somebody was in my house.  We're all usually very good about keeping the doors locked throughout the day, I didn't see anybody, and nothing immediately struck me as out of place.

I went to the doctor and he gave me a clean bill of health.  I'm not on any medication (not even antidepressants

In Mid January 2011

The day after we moved in, was greeted by my neighbor from downstairs complaining that massive amounts of water were leaking into her unit from ours. I checked the water heater and found water gushing from an emergency release valve on the top, which is never supposed to be opened.

A few weeks later, he wasn't able to climb down. He also didn't have his cellphone. He told me that he swore the door was unlocked when he went our for a cigarette. We agreed it was kind of strange but laughed about him being stuck out there for 6 hours.
A few days later

I go to bed 45 minutes later and out of nowhere I am the most terrified I have ever been in my life. I felt a strange sensation and I had the overwhelming feeling that there was some manifestation of negative energy in my room. I was hearing thoughts that were not mine

I frantically grab my phone from the window seal to text Ryan in the next room. My phone shows one new text so I click the message box but there is no new text message. Convenient time for an Iphone glitch

The next morning I wake up
A few weeks went by before one day when I'm at work and get a text from Ryan saying that he's locked out again.  Conversation is here http://i.imgur.com/zApb8.png . So I leave work early to get home and let him in. When I got home and let him in
On March 15, and he starts banging on the glass... ""Chris let me in man....hurry up let me the fuck in....."" I open the door for him and the first thing he says to me is ""bro all of this shit happened while I was out there....I FUCKING WATCHED as my room was completely torn apart by some invisible force for half an hour...""
He swears that he went out for a smoke, he watched as his room was ransacked by some invisible force. I was freaked the fuck out, and wanted nothing more then to gtfo out of there and never go back. I told Ryan that I thought we should both get out of the apartment for a while, but he just wanted to clean his room and ignore it. (His tough guy attitude toward the situation was typical). http://imgur.com/a/FtQNt


I couch surfed for about a week before regaining the courage to go back and face this thing.
The weeks and months that followed were among the worst of my life. Any peace of mind that I had in my own bedroom was lost. When I wanted to fall asleep
Ryan would go home to San Diego on the weekends, when it was around our apartment, I could feel it. I would get goosebumps out of nowhere and I could just sense it. It was a very strange sensation and I'm afraid I cannot quite effectively describe it to you. My sleeping habits deteriorated and my grades began to drop like stones. We didn't know how to deal with it so we started to ignore it....but I can tell you that It was very difficult to ignore. I found that it was nearly impossible for me to fall asleep before 2am, no matter how hard I tried. Something would always keep me up. The growling sound was the worst. It was low pitched, and extremely creepy. For a while I thought it was an airplane but after going outside and not being able to hear the sound, I concluded that the source was indeed inside the apartment.
I'm having trouble piecing the rest of the events in order so I will just list some of the creepy shit that happened:
During the day in mid April, the power outage was restricted to our two bedrooms and not the rest of the apartment. Strange. We decided to play uno on the carpet in the main room. While playing, we all 3 heard the sound of something sliding across our tile counter top in the kitchen ... I go to investigate and find that it was their bottle of Andre champagne (classy, I know.)
A few weeks ago, back and forth and making strange shapes like it was alive. I left the room and went into the kitchen. I opened the cupboard and discovered that my unopened box of honey bunches of Oates (bomb, I know) had been torn open and the bag had been pulled out at a very strange angle. Decided to leave and spend the night at the fraternity house.

I felt warm sunshine on my face and a small foot nudging my head. I opened my eyes and a saw a dirty, ""We have to get to the ferry!"" I gave her a confused look. ""It's leaving soon! Get up!"" I stood up slowly and looked around. There was a farmhouse- very much not on fire- and a barn, and a vast ocean behind a neatly manicured soybean field. ""That's funny,"" I thought, ""Salt water would kill those soybeans."" I looked around for another house, or another person, or the road, but there was only the girl and me. ""Let's go!""

To begin

I was at a friends house one night hanging out. I passed out on the couch watching tv. When I woke up, quite a few years earlier there was a family that lived there and had a few kids. One of those kids, at a relatively young age, ""hanged"" himself (thanks /u/menwithaven) in the upstairs of the house. He then began to tell me his stories and that of his family. 

JL's brother used to live there before JL did and apparently his now ex wife was very into black magic. She did the rituals in living room from time to time. One of the stories I was told from him was that they once saw a tall skinny woman with long black hair, in some way or fashion, made it know that she liked the husband and would go crazy if the wife and husband slept in the same bed. Things would fly across the room, doors open and shut randomly and so on. When they slept in separate rooms, everything was fine. Well finally, one day the husband and wife decided to have a priest come over and check things out. The priest entered the front door and it slammed shut behind him. I was told he noticed some of the ""black magic"" items she used on the mantle (i know nothing about black magic btw. Sorry if I don't  know what things are called) He immediately turned pale white and told them they are on their own and because of what she had been doing in the house there was nothing he could do to help them. He left and never again returned any of their phone calls. The husband eventually developed a bad cocaine habit and the two split up and moved out of the house. That's when JL moved in. The husband also told me that when he moved to his new house down the block that the same spirit ""followed"" him to the new house and showed herself to him a number of times, but he stated that she wasn't as ""dark or demonic"" more like just a random spirit wanting to hang out. He later moved out of country. He straightened out his life and a few years ago he was actually in training to become a priest. 

So, voices saying his name and things randomly moving from place to place about the house. His girlfriend moved in and immediately she started to notice shit. One particular story that stands out was that one time she was taking a bath an she had the radio sitting on the sink. All of a sudden the radio turned off. She turned it back up. It went back off. She turned it back up again and it stayed on for a minute. She closed her eyes and laid there. She then said she heard someone whisper ""TURN IT DOWN"" in a quiet stern voice. She opened her eyes and there stood a young man with dark wavy hair and glasses. She sat up in the tub quickly and he was gone. Just like that. No one else was home. She freaked the fuck out and grabbed some clothes and bolted to a friends house. Later that day when she told JL what happened he called his brother and described what happened. His brother told him to go across the street and talk to the old man that lived there and tell him everything that had happened. JL did and as he was describing the young man that his gf had seen the old man abruptly walked away an grabbed an old picture from the living room and showed it to them. The gf broke into tears and said that that was the guy she saw! The old man told them that the picture was his brother who had hanged himself in the upstairs of that house many years ago!  (This was before I had my first experience that I told earlier in the story) 

Another story of mine, no one ever went up there and a lot of his brothers shit was left there after the divorce). We heard whatever it was bang loudly down the steps until the upstairs door flew open and crashed into the wall behind it moving all the stuff that was in front of the door out of the way. We were shocked and just looking at each other with blank faces. JL came out of his room and said ""WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU GUYS DOING IM TRYING TO SLEEP!""  He saw our faces and instantly knew it wasn't us that made the noises. We both pointed at the upstairs door. He nervously went and shut the door and yelled ""I WISH YOU WOULD LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE!""  It's was eerie but calm the rest of the night. I was scared. I won't lie. I didn't sleep and neither did the other friend. 

Another time we were there watching tv and partying one night. There were quite a few of us friends there. JL had pictures and vases on the mantle for decoration. As we all sat there drinking and what not

I haven't talked to JL about a year or more. (I moved a few hours away until about 2 or 3 days ago we got in contact with each other. We started talking about some of the crazy shit that happened there and he told me a few new stories. (Yes ! He still lives there with his new gf and his son! He went through some rough times and moved his son and himself in with his mom for a while and went back to the house a couple years ago)(house is owned by his family btw I believe a great aunt is the deed holder)

This was a really old house and JL had learned that it had lead paint covering the walls and he wanted to make it ok for his son to live in so he decided to remodel, during the wall removal, standing on the railroad tracks near the house as he walked outside one day. Again he just stared, shaking his head and vanished. 

Well that's all I can remember right now and I will talk to him again soon and update this post with anymore stories. I plan to go visit him soon as I haven't been to the house in a few years.

Glad I got to share this with you all.

1343620020.0,xdh5i,My mother received a voicemail from my grandmothers landline phone and it is pretty disturbing.,midwayer,194,40,148,"Hello r/Paranormal
My grandmother lives alone in an old house that my mother and her two sisters grew up in. When they were children the house was supposedly haunted by spirits. My mother was haunted by a voice that would call her name ""Judy"" from the bathroom

So today my mother calls me and asks if I pranked her by leaving her a creepy voicemail. I explain to her that I didn't, and my mother even went over her house durning the day to ask her about the message and she was told that there was no way she left a message on her phone. The message is not static but seems more glitchy, but there is a dominant low voice that seems to say my mothers name slowly ""Juuuuddyyy"" at times. its 50 seconds long and repeats. I brought my friends over because they love the supernatural so we came over to see what we could investigate, and to help my mother put because she is extremely religious and emotional. I figured out how to send the message to my own phone and then uploaded it to my computer where I have some software that can enhance the sound clips. Every time I listen to it I get shivered down my back, and I wanted to see what anyone else thinks of this. 
I have uploaded the original voicemail to an mp4 on mediafire. I am not sure if there is an easier way to share this

The message came in a dream

The house is a multi-story (2.5?) brick georgian style with a mansard roof. There are columns on a small porch, legs folded under her, leaning over looking mournfully down into the water. 

To the right of the pool is a brushy tall undergrowth that blocks the view to the next lot over. In the next lot over is a machinery shop/automechanic shop. The shop consists of two buildings: the main shop which looks like what a convenience store may have looked like in the 20's - an office but also a place to buy a Co-cola and a packet of peanuts or stuff like that, and I saw one or two Mexican men in his employ there. When the owner saw me out there peeking in the garage, he ran me away. That is when I walked back toward the house. 

Standing in the yard by the reflecting pool and facing down the road to the left, if not a big creek. 

Looking back to the house, two are in front of and slightly down from the other two). White concrete steps. Fluctuating with this image is a crumbling wreck of what used to be that house, blackened brick, shattered windows, no shutters, roof caved in. The reflecting pool is the same. They want me to see how beautiful it was, but over that image is an overgrowth and weeds in the yard growing over the broken statuary and choking the dank water. You'd never know that pool was there. 

The machine shop didn't change. It is an old place and hasn't changed much, packed dirt in the yard between the two buildings. 

The reason I was contacted was that the machinery/automechanic shop is buying the land that the Old Bickford Place is on and razing the ruins that are left. 

There is someone still at the Old Bickford Place: Harriett (emphasis on the 'yett') Bickford, she will be gone too and that is why she wants me to pass along a message. 

I walked up to the house, he was an avid sportsman and hunter. There are old guns mounted on the walls, decoys here and there, memorabilia from past hunts, rustic paintings of various scenes. His room is quiet, tranquil - a portrait of his past. He is not here. I sense nothing but memory. 

The other room, there is the left wall less than two feet from the door and the right wall is maybe fifteen feet from the door. In that corner is Harriett's chair, an uncomfortable looking fairly modern chair that adjusted. It was not a recliner, rather something that looked more like you would see in a nursing home: white plastic with blue parts. The chair was vibrating and shaking in the corner, and I knew she was there. I couldn't see her, but I could feel her and hear her rage. Beside the chair sat a woman at least in her 80s, and a younger woman in her early 50s - long straight blonde hair with a plain face

They are trying to lead me to William's room, so I wasn't afraid. I walked to the chair, picked it up and awkwardly started rocking the chair back and forth like a baby. Then, just like that - there she was: a reddish haired toddler, rocking and being comforted. Somehow I knew through what she 'thought' to me that she was acknowledging the fact that at the end of her life, she was angry, mean and spiteful to her daughter and granddaughter

The message was simple: ""Tell them it isn't William's fault"". Though she didn't have the words for it, with no way to articulate her fear or her anger. She wanted them to know that she was sorry, that she was sorry for letting them think it was William's fault (evidently she told them he did something to her, or they thought he did something to her to make her the way she ended up but she did not elaborate), that she understood that she pushed them away by being a hissing, anger-spitting, spiteful

When the house is torn down completely and everything is burned off and bulldozed over, consider passing along the message. It may lead to nothing, but at the very least I will feel better knowing I at least made an effort.

The story begins at my Texas high school. My mother had agreed to drop my best friend off at her house after school was over. We piled into the car. My mother drove

We started by turning onto the main road. Around 1 minute into our drive we noticed the end of a red string waving about an inch away of the middle of the windshield. It came from directly in front of us but we couldn't tell from where. There was a school bus ahead of our car, so I started pulling. We followed the bus for 2.2 miles. During this time we went over a high way and under an underpass. 18 wheelers, trucks and cars were speeding by us on the left. Still, I pulled the string in. By this time I had handed the bulk of string (a baseball sized ball) to the backseat for my friend to hold onto. We turned left, across the busy traffic, onto a new road. I expected the string to follow the bus that was continuing on in the other direction, but instead the string remained in front of us at the same level as the horizon. Everyone shifted in their seats and became quiet. I continued, to pull the string in through my window. All the while the string pulled back. After 1.4 miles we turned again. The string remained. We took a hard right and then a hard left. The string followed the road directly in front of us. It's origins blurred by distance. We took another right onto my friends roads. My friend and I both were pulling as quickly as we could. The string remained taut. It never drooped or gave way. No

That night my friend and I cut the string in half and each took our handful. My mother says it was by far the weirdest thing that she's ever witnessed.

I wondered if anyone else has ever experienced something like this

When I was eight or nine years old my family moved into a house that was about 100 years old

Over the next 5 years we completely remodeled the house and turned it into something beautiful. The house, was now a cute dove grey home with flowers and gardens and life. It had been a rent home, we found out, as many friendly locals would randomly stop by and say ""Oh we lived here when I was a kid and it looks so nice now! Can we have a tour?"" Our closest neighbor, a very cranky old woman, had even lived there as a child with her period-appropriate huge family.

The house was surrounded by about 100 acres of Texas plains in any direction between other homes so we were pretty secluded. Being so old it had the understandable character. It had electrical quirks

My bedroom was right off the living room and my parents were in the back of the house (single story) so I never really heard them back there at night. 

When I was about 12 our family was pretty happy. My parents never fought, dicking around in my room. 

My door was closed, and was confused as to what the hell she should be upset over. As I reached my door I could swear I heard the living room floor creaking. It sounded like that slow back and forth groan of a rocking chair... but that couldn't be. We didn't have a rocking chair and the floor didn't creak that loudly because of the carpet. You had to be in the actual room it was squeaking in to hear it. 

I opened my door and since the living room was empty I walked back to my parents closed room. I still heard the crying coming from somewhere, and stopped sneaking into the kitchen at night for snacks. I didn't hear it again for a few years. After my parents split when I was 15 I started hearing the same thing about once a month but never had the guts to go investigate further. I moved out when I was 18, never having shared the story.

About 4 years later I was talking to my mom and since she wasn't living alone in the house at the time I told her my story. The color drained out of her face and she looked very shaken. I asked if she had heard it before too. She said after I moved out she had heard it frequently. Then one day she was visiting with the aforementioned cranky neighbor (without mentioning the sounds)who had this story to share.

Anyways, despite loving him very much and knowing that he also loved me very much. In short, he was a great dad, kind and generous, but we didn't really know each other that well, no big deal. While he was in hospital it disturbed me how disheartened he became after the operation. I felt incredibly sad for him as he was never going to be able to eat solid food ever again. It was just sad.

One afternoon I went to visit him on the ward and learned that he had been taken to intensive care where he was fighting for his life. A blood clot caused by the operation had blocked a blood vessel and he was in an induced coma. A long, I went home, cried a lot and slept.

The next day, I may even have been looking at porn. It was exactly 1pm and I suddenly felt incredibly tired again. Grieving is surprisingly tiring. I slid off my computer chair and slumped on my bed. 

I lay there for a few moments and suddenly became aware of my fathers presence in my room behind me. Genuine spine chill. I hadn't been in my place long enough for my dad to have ever visited me so it wasn't nostalgia or a memory, I could also feel/hear/sense our old family dog, a bullmastiff, long, long dead right next to me, panting away. This dog was much loved and perhaps was the single most important bond our family had ever had. All the happiest times in both mine and I my fathers lives while my brother and I had been children had revolved around adventures we had had with that dog.
Anyway, not even my head. I could smell the familiar 'dad' smell of slightly worn off aftershave and soap that my dad always had. I was scared I must say.

 I croaked: ""Daaaaaaad?"" and as I said it I managed to turn around and I saw him there standing next to my bed smiling at me. (The dog was gone) He was wearing a weird red silky shirt, there.

All of this

Apologies if this is a boring story

For a year or two afterwards, a certainty that he *was not* there/here with me in any way shape or form. It's this sureness I get of him not being here that makes my sighting, my experience of him the day after he died seem all the more real.",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1983le/i_saw_my_dead_father_true_story/
1351085596.0,12060x,Scratches and letters appearing on GF body over the course of 3 days,christoforever,173,46,227,"The story is as follows ... On day one (this past Saturday night 10/20/12) we come home and lock all the doors and head to our bedroom to watch a movie before we go to sleep. Mid-way through the movie GF goes downstairs to grab something to drink. She yells up to me asking why I left all the doors open. I go downstairs to find both our front and back doors completely open. Thinking maybe I did leave them open I close them and we go back upstairs. The following morning I wake up and go downstairs to find both doors completely wide open again. At this point we are really scared and I'm thinking someone has been playing games and possibly breaking in our home (though nothing is stolen). So later that day we change the locks and by some security bars for both doors.
     Later that night (Sunday now and day two 10/21/12) we are playing w/ our children and she says she is feeling a burning sensation on her legs. So her and I go to the bathroom and we see deep scratches (in 3's and 4's) on her legs some of which are slightly bleeding. Now we are little freaked out. Maybe she has something which is causing this but we don't know. So we put our children to sleep and go to sleep ourselves. During the middle of the night she wakes up screaming that something is pulling her hair. After a minute or so she stops screaming and goes right back to sleep. The next morning we look over her and notice that along w/ the scratches there are now bruises all over her legs. We are really upset and scared at this point but continue on with our day so as not to alert or scare the children.
     Later that night (Monday now and day 3 10/22/12) we go upstairs to lay down. Before doing so we check her over for any new marks and don't notice anything. While watching tv and she falls asleep on me. Half hour later (It's about 11:00 pm) she wakes up saying her stomach is burning. We lift her shirt up to find letters (along w/ more scratches) scratched into her abdomen.
     At this point we are really scared and don't know what to do. I take her to the ER and all the doctor's there say they have no explanation. They say the markings look a few days old but I show them the pictures taken each day and they tell me it's impossible given the scarring. The doctors ruled out all the possible medical reasons. We don't know what to do or what could be causing this. We think it may be a spirit of some sort. I've posted an album on imgur of what's taken place:

http://imgur.com/a/BXfjD

The most telling picture is the one on her abdomen here:

http://imgur.com/a/BXfjD#a2PbN

Can anyone tell what it says or make out a possible name/word? The only thing I can make out is: 'MNIENN'. Feel free to ask any questions as I'll be more than happy to provide answers to try and understand what is going on. Thanks.

EDIT: Thinking the first night she may have been sleep walking I put powder at the foot of our bedroom door and throughout various places along the path to both of our front and back doors. I also put powder on our door handle of our bedroom door. Nothing was disturbed.

EDIT2: We are both from

EDIT3: We are (or at least were) both atheists. She is a doctor and I an engineer.

EDIT4: We did put garlic/rosemary/sage all around our bedroom and burned lavender candles all night last night (which would be the 4th night) and nothing happened. Not sure what this means but it's at least something.

UPDATE (10/24/12): Unbeknownst to me yesterday morning on her way to work she stopped at a family members house (someone we've been confiding too in all of this and someone who is a practicing catholic) who had called in a ""witch"" (sorry I don't know the proper name) to make the negative spirit go away. She was not told the woman's name. She said the woman looked a bit older (60's or later). The woman said that as soon as she walked in the door she could feel the negative energy/spirit with her. The woman said a chant in Spanish and fixed together a drink which my girlfriend described as looking clear-like. She was told to drink all of it. She said it tasted horrible. The rest of the morning/afternoon she was throwing up constantly. Late afternoon she told me she started to feel much better. The woman/witch told her that essentially it's a negative spirit and that whatever door was opened she now closed it and to leave it alone. And that she will be fine and things around the house will start to feel better over the next couple days. Again I don't know what is making the difference here but the disturbances have stopped and things seem to be Ok again.

EDIT:5 We tried to get more information out of the family member

UPDATE (10/28/12): Exaxtly 1 week to the day the ""disturbances"" have returned. This time it has affected both of us. This past night it

UPDATE (11/03/12): During the night I was tapped on the head again. No more than 10 minutes later my GF was pinched hard on the leg (enough to wake her up from a dead sleep). A few hours later I woke up to my arm burning and noticed these:

     http://i.imgur.com/QWRqr.jpg

     http://i.imgur.com/fYndX.jpg

It looks like little nips or bites on my arm. I'll continue to update as ""things"" keep happening.

UPDATE (11/08/12 - 11/09/12): A few hours before dawn on both of these nights are youngest daughter (3 1/2 years) woke up asking if we could put her blankets back on her. While walking to her room she said she heard doggy sounds and made the typical doggy ""growl"". When we entered her room we noticed that her blankets had not fallen off her bed but instead were folded neatly on top of her dresser quite a ways away. 

UPDATE (11/11/12 - Daytime): While taking a shower I heard a thump in our room. Opening the door I see one my GF's boots sitting directly in front of the bathroom door. I ran downstairs to tell my GF who was sleeping on the couch and we came upstairs to poke around a bit. Eventually she sits down on our bed and I go back into the bathroom (door open). Directly behind me, which was locked by the way, it magically unlocked and swung open. So in my brilliance I decide to take a walk downstairs (it should be noted this is not a creepy basement but had in fact been done over by the previous owners and is now a bar and couple bedrooms). About half-way down the door slams shut on me. I run back to the top and open it and see my GF walking over asking why I just slammed the door shut. After telling her it was not me I ask her to hold the door open while I walk downstairs. Again about half-way down my GF is pushed out of the hall-way and into the stairwell. At that moment I grab her and we leave the house.

UPDATE (11/14/12): We have not been sleeping at the house but at friends/families house until this issue is solved. Tonight we had a couple guys from http://www.tmprg.com/ come and check out our place. These guys were great and stayed w/ us for hours explaining everything and anything as well as answering all of our questions. We now have a plan in place on how to proceed for the next couple of weeks and what we can do. Basically document everything from when/where as these things often ""occur"" in patterns and figuring out those patterns can better help us understand what we are dealing with. I will update again in a few weeks w/ how things are progressing (or unless something happens sooner). 

Update(1/20/13): a LOT has happened since last I posted so bare with me while I get this all out.

Before the guys from tmprg came we were put in contact with a local spiritual warfare group associated with a nearby church. They came over and immediately felt them in our house. By them I mean an infestation of demonic spirits (their words not mine). They said these spirits have been here for a while hiding dormant and that for whatever reason us moving into the house woke them up. They said they felt the presence of a leader with many ""soldiers"" underneath it. In their opinion this was entirely demonic as is all types of ""spiritual happenings"". To them anything that is interfering in our lives would be demonic and their is no such thing as ""good"" spirits. In either event they proceeded to remove these entities from our house. Mostly it was calling the creatures out and telling them to leave in Jesus name. One guy was speaking in tongues at one point. When they were done they said nothing should happen again but because of the infestation it's possible they missed a couple and to notify them if anything happens again. As it were things did (and still do) happen again but nothing as crazy as what's already been said. The next week the guys from tmprg were scheduled to come. In between this week there were taps and pinches at night but that's it.

 The following weeks the guys/gals from tmprg came and did an investigation in our house. The sensitive they had with them did note that the ""entity"" was here and it's presence was filling the entire house. At one point while we were all talking (mind you there are 8 strangers in our house at this point) my girlfriend becomes completely drained of energy and proceeds to pass out. I had to help her to the couch. We were unable to wake her for a little while. The sensitive said this does happen and that the entity here was feeding off of her energy. After letting her rest for a half-hour or so we were able to wake her. She also said that the entity hated women

Not more than a few days later did taps and pinches start happening again. The following week I had the local spiritual warfare guys come back and they also felt the demons were still there but much less powerful/present than before. They did their chanting/yelling to purge it from the house and again said its entirely demonic and that Jesus is the only way to remove it from the house. We were also advised to remove anything negative/ungodly from our house as this could attract them. They specifically noted Harry potter books as the spells inside them can be used in real life to call the enemy. One of their guys who was able to see ""that side"" more so than the others said that in addition to the non-human spirits he saw he was also seeing what was once human spirits walking around. He said he had no way of explaining this or how it fit into the christian religion (because their is only heaven/hell after you die) only that it is what it is.

A few days after they left, why the big things are no longer happening. There have been scratches recently on her but nothing crazy. I've not heard back from tmprg as to what, if anything, they found while recording audio/video. I'll try and get in contact with them and see if they found anything.

UPDATE: I did eventually get in contact w/ tmprg and they said they found nothing on audio/video recordings while they were here. I unfortunately had them come AFTER the spiritual warfare guys came so the thinking was the sw guys got rid of mostly everything that was here. They did say they ran the letters on my girlfriends chest through all their language programs and the one they were able to come up with

     ima ile ei vini

    *which literally translates into english (via google translate) 'lower intestines to wine'

It should be noted that after the 1st time the spiritual-warfare guys came activity decreased substantially. They made sure to point out that when your forcing these entities to leave that you do so ""In Jesus name"". 

UPDATE (2/22/13): We've had a lot more activity recently. Here are the ""highlights"" of the past few weeks:

     -More scratches. Both on my GF's legs and stomach. No written words/letters just scratch marks. There were also minor scratches appearing just above her right breast. Again all of the scratches are preceded by an itching/burning sensation.
     -A small toy was thrown at my GF (hit her on the cheek) after leaving the bathroom one day.
     -One night we both came downstairs into the kitchen to find ALL of the cabinet doors wide open as well as the       bar stools for our bar flipped over and sitting on top of our bar.
     -One night as we were commanding it to leave we walked up our main stair-well which leads to our bedroom
     -It has said ""hey"" or ""hello"" a few times
     -My 50+ pound set of weights was moved from one corner of my bedroom into the front of our bathroom. Once I noticed I put them back and left the room and went downstairs. When I came back upstairs
     -The letter ""M""

1355149517.0,14lrw6,Hide and Seek Alone. (A popular Korean ghost game ... super creepy!),JesusJones207,155,35,43,"**I copied this text from another person's blog**

So I heard about this game called ""Hide and Seek Alone""

And this is basically what it is;

""Playing hide-and-seek alone is pretty popular in Korea and Japan (probably China as well)

The meaning of this play is ""If you can find me
This ""play"" is necromancy - it is potentially very dangerous. It is not recommended that you do it
This play is not good for your sanity.

You need:
- A doll with legs. Not a human doll
- Rice. The spirit that eats this offering is said to grow stronger.
- Red thread. This later symbolizes blood and acts as a restraint.
- Something from your body. It's usually fingernails, hair, etc. It becomes a curse if you use someone else's body parts.
- Weapon. Something to stab the doll so that you can anger it. Real knives are dangerous
- Salt/Saltwater or alcohol. Without this
- Safety place. You NEED a safe sanctuary, etc.
- A name. Giving the spirit a name is the most powerful thing a human can give to the spirit. Names give spirits great power.

Method:
1.Cut the doll and replace the foam/stuffing with rice.
2. Place something from your body into the doll.
3. Wrap the doll with a red thread as if to hinder(stop) the doll.
4. In a bathroom
5. Place a cup of salt water in the place before starting the game.

To play:
Start at 3 AM
Give the doll a name (for example: Bob).
When the clock strikes 3
When talking to the doll
Now go to the bathroom and place the doll in the washbasin.
Turn off all lights.
Close your eyes and count to 10
Go to the doll in the washbasin and say

""I found you (doll name)!""

And stab the doll.
After that

""Now (doll name) is it! Now (doll name) is it! Now (doll name) is it!""

Place the weapon next to the doll and go to your hiding (safety) place. You MUST lock the door.
Also
Place the salt water in your mouth. DO NOT SPIT IT OUT. The salt water will protect you from the spirit.

To end the game:
When you want to end the game
The doll may not be in the bathroom. (There are instances of the doll being outside).
When you find the doll
Close your eyes and shout
""I win! I win! I win!""

The doll will give up.
It is advised to burn the doll after the game.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
-You MUST play this game alone. If more than one person does this at the same time
- Do NOT go outside the house.
- Keep the game under 2 hours. After this time
- When hiding
- Turn off all electronics before starting.
- When running away
- When discovered by the doll, so you must be careful.
- After the game is over

Experiences:
People say that usually the TV flips channels on its own, doors seem to open and shut on their own, or you can hear the sound of laughter. Often when the doll is found, it's away from the its original spot. Sometimes, the demons actually chase after your spot and demand that you come out.""",,False,t5_2qjxn,True

1372713555.0,1hgaqn,I used to work in a haunted house,Lovekats29,144,29,17,"I used to work in a haunted house. At first glance it didn’t look like much - a simple split level on a residential street in a suburb of Jacksonville

It was little things at first – you put your pen down on the counter and turn to do something and the pen is gone. You look EVERYWHERE only for the pen to show up where you know you left it in the first place. The computers went haywire… and we had fairly new Macs which were trouble free in the old location. We started joking about “the ghost”. “The ghost” took your pen. “The ghost” crashed your computer again… It was funny for a while. And then the cleaning crew quit – because they saw a little girl floated outside the upstairs window. 

My boss (and owner) of the company joked around about it at first. And then the employees started sharing their stories. A man in overalls with mutton shop sideburns was seen in the house when the first employees arrived for the day – they unlocked the doors, glug, glug… like someone had gotten a glass of water from it. I know what you are thinking… sometimes those coolers make the noise on their own. But this one was bone dry – no water in it. He packed up his stuff and left for the night. 

Then the interactions got more intense. One particular worker was pinched and scratched in the back room of the house that we used for our bindery area and storage. My boss – who would come to work at 3 or 4 in the morning had several experiences. One morning she came to work and went down to the back room to get some files. As she was leaving she heard a voice tell her to

Now up until this point I had heard a lot of stories but hadn’t had anything happen to me. I think part of the reason for that was that I a) did not work after dark and/or alone and b) said out loud to whatever was there that I did not want to see or hear it. But one particular day I was working at my computer and our pressman (a diehard skeptic and volunteer fireman) came up from the garage to grab a soda out of the kitchen. He passed by my desk before pausing and darting upstairs to the accounting offices. He came back down the stairs looking white as a ghost and asked if our boss had passed by my desk. I told him that no one had been by. He then explained to me that he had  seen our boss in her office by the kitchen when he went to get his soda. She was standing there smiling at him. He assumed she was ribbing him for dropping a bunch of rush jobs on him. When he came back into my area

That Halloween a local radio station had a contest  - they would broadcast from a haunted location in the area. We entered and told about all of our stories and won! The radio station came out early that morning before I was even awake. By the time I got in my car and started to listen, a ruler had been suspended on a wall and fallen right in front of a coworker! Crazy stuff! As soon as I got to work I ran to find someone who had witnessed the ruler falling. A coworker took me to the infamous back room and showed me where a metal ruler had been suspended high on a wall, right above a doorway. There was no shelf or even molding of any kind around the door. It was just painted cinderblock. As she is explain this to me, over to our left we saw another coworker… he was just standing there staring at us while we talked. Suddenly, here is this same coworker coming in the door on the opposite side of the room! The two of us looked at each other and asked him how he did that! He looked at us like we were nuts and said he had been out back cleaning the mop for a while. There was absolutely NO WAY he could have gone from where we saw him to the back door. 

Later we listened to some of the earlier broadcast on playback. At the time, threatening voice that said, “LEAVE ME ALONE.” 

After the broadcast my boss was contacted by several psychic mediums. She let probably half a dozen come to the house. Some of them were quacks but there were three or four of them who actually came up with the same details. One of these psychics stood out

She said there were four main spirits in the house: a young woman in her late 20s to early 30s, until she walked into the back room.

As soon as she entered the room she was visibly shaken. She excused herself and said that she could not stay in the room, there had been. Then she said, “That’s where he cut them up.” That is how we found out that not only was our house/office haunted. But it had been the scene of at least one murder. And a mutilation murder at that!

Needless to say

I just googled the address and found that the commercial property is available to rent for $2500 a month. I just wouldn’t stay there after dark if I were you.

I had a ""weird feeling"" all day



The kids looked at each other and started giggling.  I whirled around and saw the ball suspended in midair for a split second before falling to the ground.  The kids just kept laughing.  They started pointing and saying what sounded like ""the man! the man!""

I have been really sick for a few weeks now - terrible migraines, trouble breathing (we thought it was my asthma), insane dreams - and just got back from school last week.  My mother thought it was a really bad, really strong case of the flu.  



A few days ago I was lying on the couch



Suddenly, and I could breathe with no problem.  I was also standing.  I opened my eyes and saw that I was standing on the opposite side of the living room, looking at the couch.  My mother was bent over the couch, touching a person lying there.  I realized that the person she was standing over was me.  



She touched my shoulder and said, and nothing happened.  She started feeling for a pulse and breathing.  Then she started screaming.



My dad, but I couldn't.  It felt like I was moving underwater.  My dad started chest compressions while my sister dialed 911.  As soon as my dad pressed on my chest a few times, I felt my (ghost?) self being pulled forward.

I am a very skeptical and logical person who does not believe in the paranormals in particular, dispite me being only 2 when it happened. But somehow I don't remember it as a normal 1st-person memory; I remember seeing it above myself as it happened. Somehow while this occurred it was as if I were floating above myself watching it happen, and the memory plays in my head like a video camera strapped to the ceiling recording the scene.


I was playing with toys on the floor of my living room. My father was sitting on the couch a few feet away, I just stood up, and then slowly turned around and faced my father. I looked around the room saying, ""Who am I? Where am I?"". I was extremely confused and disorientated.

Then I walked towards my father. I began frantically asking him for help. 

""Who am I?"" I asked my father. 

""...Well

 ""No

Then, walked back to my spot on the floor, and continued playing with my toys.

My parents tried for years to find information about this. Eventually they did find a Welty boarding house in the 1800s which got set on fire.

This turned out to be really

Boring background that is probably not relevant at all

When I was 5, and used to be a farmer's house, I think. It was here before our town was even established. About 30 years ago, when the suburb was being developed, they didn't want to just tear the old half down, since it was in good shape, so they just tore one side off and added on to it, and the rest of the house is just slapped onto the side of it. 

Anyways, and there's history here. 

I'm the only person with a bedroom in the old half of the house. All the other bedrooms are in the new half. The very first night we were all sleeping in the new house, even when I was little. But I just woke up, and it was like someone had just put knowledge into my head. I knew that there was something I *had* to do, that it was on me. 

I grabbed my Nani (stuffed animal I loved very much, I saw several small balls of bright blue light that were moving around. There were about 7-10 of them, each about half the size of a soccer ball, and about a foot off the floor. They were floating in the air, but it wasn't a light, easy floating. It felt like people standing at a meeting, maybe shifting around a bit or moving around to get to their spot, that they were watching men to see what I would do. They arranged themselves into a rough half-circle

I knew that they wanted some kind of sacrifice. Not sacrifice, because of their importance. It was like the same way a king expects a emissary to bring a gift. They wanted something valuable and important to me. So I gave Nani one last hug and kiss, and carefully set her down in the middle of the half-circle, which was about the middle of the room. As soon as I did that, it felt settled, like a contract had been signed. So I went up to my room and went to sleep. The next morning, before my parents woke up, and Nani was gone. 

I have to explain something really quick. Throughout the experience, or sad, or anything but sort of matter-of-fact. It was just like ""ok, this is what's happening, this is what I have to do"". It felt very business-like.

I think I bought protection or something for our house. In the time we've lived here, we definitely should have had flooding, or power problems, or water problems, or something. But we've always been fine! This is especially odd because according to the guy who inspected our house a couple years ago (my parents were thinking about selling), the builder for the new side did a shitty job with sub-par materials, and by all rights that side should be basically falling apart. But it's totally fine! 

Additionally, nothing falling over and breaking, and no animal attacks or bites (despite several meeeeeean dogs of guests). 

I don't know if I'm just crazy and we're lucky, and that's all I know. It felt very real to me.

I would love to get any theories or information about the blue lights

Thank you!

1361307847.0,18u9k9,I got more than I bargained for at the Thrift Store. Finally sharing my experience with the Paranormal,the_clown_prince,133,31,36,"

Everything you are about to read is 100% true. The things I'm about to talk about took place between 3 and 4 years ago.
 
Some background on myself, but I just felt drawn to. It was $7 and I really didn't want to buy it, but I felt like I had to, so I did. I didn't mention this feeling to anyone because I didn't think anything of it. 

By this time she had a baby girl, and their baby have the back room, I have the middle room, and my parents are in the front.
Anyway

 After a few weeks I started feeling like I was being watched in my room. It was a feeling I never had in my own home before. Whenever I was in my room I felt like there was someone behind me watching.
 My bed faced my door. I always slept with the door closed because my dogs sleep in my room with me. Not long after the feeling of being watched I finally saw it.

 I woke up in the middle of the night and I felt it really strong so I sat up and looked around my room. Obviously it was pitch black, but I never saw any details on him.

 I honestly don't know how long this went on. All I know is that night after night he was there

 I didn't want to say anything to anyone because I watch a lot of paranormal shows because the topic intrigues me. My dad thinks it's all crap and thinks I'm scared of my own shadow. If I told him, but I didn't want to because I didn't know what she'd think. Finally she came into my room one day and asked if she could talk to me about something. (last time this happened she was pregnant.) Naturally, I said yes, and sat down to talk. 

She told me she didn't want me to think she was crazy, and he would. She finally came to me, because she saw him bending over her daughter's crib. 

Yes, you can attest to this: a baby's hunger cry, and a baby's scared cry are two very distinct sounds. Apparently this had happened repeatedly lately.

 I was freaked.

 I told her I had been seeing him every night for weeks. He watches me while I sleep. She said we had to do something about it

She went out food shopping and I was home alone for a bit. Looking back on it, some kind of COWARD!? Does that make you feel good scaring a woman, and a baby? Does that make you feel like a big man? You leave her alone! Don't ever go near my niece or my sister again! You want to pick on somebody? PICK ON SOMEONE YOUR OWN SIZE!"" I was almost in tears by the time I had finished screaming. 

I went back into my room and got changed. Went on with the rest of my evening

 I woke up and looked over to where he stood, he was glaring at me, and I knew it.

 I was terrified

My blanket got thrown against the wall next to my bed and when I tried to grab it

This went on until 4:01am. It was less than an hour

The next day I went and bought a St. Michael statue and put medals around my room. I was terrified to sleep in there. I told my sister the jist of what happened (this is the first time I've ever shared full details)

It turns out

If I haven't lost you by now, was the first day since I bought it that I didn't wear it. When I didn't wear it I felt like a different person, I felt like a weight had been lifted from me. Like I was chained, and now I was free. It was an odd feeling.

 I never wore the hat again. The man didn't go away immediately though.

 You see

 A few weeks after the attack, and since I didn't wear the hat anymore I cut it up to use it on a costume. I didn't like how it turned out, so I threw it out.

 After the hat was destroyed and gone
 
Now, but I have experienced everything you have just read.

This past Monday night my coworker committed suicide. 

I came the morning after and lit a candle for him. He was the first amidst the office to not only help me get my bearings for the job but welcome me as a friend. We went to breakfast and would just mess around during our shifts. It was almost like I was a kid-sister... or something. 

One of the things he'd do to ""bug"" me was rub his index finger and his thumb together to make a vibrating noise that would sound like a bee. He'd do it right next to my ear so that'd tickle and I'd jump back. 

I decided to check out the new break room that was built for us today. I lounged on the new couch for a minute next to the lamp we were going to have memorialized for him (with a plaque). As I was walking through the hall to leave the break room to get back to work

My ear tickled and I stopped. 

I walked back through the hall to see if maybe some new thing in the wall was making noise or something (since the room was just built). But I couldn't find the sound again. Beside that

I'm not sure if it was him or not. But if it is

A few weeks into living there I began to get very strange vibes from the place. I began feeling like somebody was in the room with me, I actually wasn't too scared about it. It was a very non-threatening feeling.

3 weeks in I went out and I purchased a dog. He was just a puppy but the whole time he grew up he would increasingly wake up for no reason

About a month in a had a very strange dream. I was in the living room of my apartment and I saw a lady in there that drifted across the living room. In the dream I said, bathroom fans turning on, doors being unlocked and locked, and even seeing shadows underneath doorways. Again, I was never scared but still didn't know what was going on. There began to be a distinct smell that only occupied the second bathroom. An almost ""elderly"" odor if that makes sense. An odor that was not apparent in any other room of the house.

Well, ""who told you that?!?"" Well... turns out, an elderly lady had passed away in my living room of cancer just a month or so before I moved in. She was a dog lover, a great person, and from what my neighbor (who has her urn and dog) says, a bit of a prankster! I described the features of the lady I saw in my dream to my neighbor and she almost lost it. I was spot on when I told her what she looked like.

It was late at night, casting a big light patch on the wall opposite me. I remember it clearly

Now... imagine, with the headlights of a car behind. I'm sure you can imagine the way you would see their shadow, clearly humanoid, looming up alongside your own. 

Well, only person awake, I saw that shadow. In the rectangle of moonlight opposite me, I saw a shadow like that of a person walking towards the hut grow up the wall over about 20 seconds. It even swayed slightly from side to side as a person's shadow would with each footstep. When the shadow was filling about 3/4s of the moonlit space on the wall, it suddenly shot to the side, as if a person had suddenly dived away to avoid being seen. 

I got up, and told him I thought someone was outside. We went all around the hut, and there was no one out there. We called out into the night, and there was no response. We were about 20kms from the nearest highway, on a remote bush track, so its not like there were many casual passers by. There were certainly no vehicles nearby that we could hear the sound of, and like I said

Pretty much the most unnerving thing I have ever seen. I've never seen anything like it since

1362975227.0,1a2b6j,My first paranormal experience and how it has affected me for 14 years - quite an unsettling story so don't read before bed!,spf20,105,13,33,"Hey guys

When I was about 7 my parents had an extension put into the attic of our house

However, when I told my parents about this my Mum started coming upstairs to read with me and my Dad would play songs on the guitar until I fell asleep. They would then turn off the light and I would generally not wake up until the morning.

But then one night, like I had just opened my eyes after holding them shut for a while. I remember an intense feeling of what I can only describe now as dread all over me. The room had never looked darker and I was terrified. Then I saw him. I looked across the room and saw a little boy, around the same age as I was, pale faced, vacant expression, standing by the bookcase. He was dressed in Victorian clothing (my house is a Victorian house) and was looking at my books. Lying at his feet was a huge black dog with long, straggly hair. As you can imagine I was paralysed with fear, the boy looked right at me. I can't remember much about his face other than he was very pale. Immediately

Now, but for me when something is gone it should stay gone. But anyway, for many years I just thought I had just imagined it (I had an incredibly over active imagination, like most children do) but in the past year I have noticed some patterns. (I just realised that this is going to be quite long, sorry! Please bare with me, I could really use some advice on this).

Okay so firstly, I would get them a lot and go running around the house screaming in fear until my parents calmed me down. I wont go into details but basically, about a year ago I asked my Mum when these started. She said at around 7 years old. I asked for her to be more specific and she said when I moved into the attic, which could be explained as simply a young boy being freaked out by changing rooms but maybe not.
Anyway, and especially when I slept in that room I would have friends and girls stay over as much as possible. In fact, still today I always have a good proper look around the room before turning out the light and my girlfriend has got to understand that, some nights, if it doesn't feel right the light stays on all night.

I also thought about this room and the effect it had on my lifestyle. When I was about 14 I started smoking weed (and still do), to be honest, scared of everything. I would sometimes get panic attacks that I would have to ride out in my room on my own because I didn't want my parents to know I was taking drugs. I would talk to myself and cut my arms, with no real understanding of why. I moved out of the room when I was nearly 19 and I stopped taking the more dangerous drugs, felt a lot better about myself and generally turned my life around. Now, my little brother who's around about 2 years younger moved into that room. He had developed a strong reliance on skunk, starting when he was about 15, when he moved up to that room he started having panic attacks, moved out and is now at university himself, isolation in the house and just general teenage angst. But the pattern seems interesting to me.

When I was in the room, wrote on the walls and just did general disrespectful teenage stuff. However, I realised a while ago when I was in the room what I did to the bookshelf. Now, this is pretty horrible and I'm actually crying whilst writing about it. I had a very large hunting knife from when I was in the scouts. I had, over time, hacked away at the bookshelves with this knife. However, I only ever hacked at one shelf and recently I realised that this was the same shelf that the boy was standing by. When my brother was packing for university we were emptying the bookshelf and I saw, ""No one will ever love you"". It scared the hell out of me when I saw it.

The other day my parents moved up to the room because of decorating work in their room. After a night in there my Mum felt very uncomfortable, her husband was with her, the room is well insulated and is the biggest room in the house! I understood immediately when my Mum told me and I said for her to use my room (now downstairs, thank God!)

I'm 21 years old and haven't slept in the room alone since I first moved out. I don't know if anyone had any ideas on this but I thought I'd share. I'm not at all a die hard believer but it interests me and wondered what you guys thought. Personally

1343165712.0,x3ft5,Do you guys think we should have a sidebar that links to relevant articles debunking common paranormal mistakes and misconceptions? ,chipstar325,108,23,27,"So I've been lurking the paranormal subreddit for a while

Things that have already been debunked or at the very least given very plausible explanations are still investigated as if they are new phenomena. This is counterproductive and makes paranormal investigators look silly

I propose that we create a sidebar that lists some of these common paranormal events/pieces of evidence and links to articles or video showing that they are not paranormal in nature
My list would include:
-The crystal skulls (of which none have been dated to ancient times
-Spirit orbs (dust in a cameras flash for the most part)
-The surgeons photo of Nessie (a known hoax)
-The idea that humans couldn't possibly have created Stonehenge or the Moa of Easter island (shown to be possible using simple physics principles)
-The paranormal phenomenon attributed to the Oregon Vortex house (shown to be an optical illusion caused by the slope of the house/grounds and the dense forest around the home)
-The starchild skull (the skull of a child who died most likely of a genetic defect)
-Any UFO or cryptid photo or video that is a known or suspected hoax
-Anything that purports to know how Sasquatch lives in the wild/where it lives/what it eats that doesn't use inference from good primate biology. Jeff Meldrum is a great cryptozoologist because he doesn't simply assume that every forested area is ""squatchy"" but looks for real biological reasons for why a Bigfoot may live in an area and backs it up!
-Any paranormal ability that can be replicated by an experienced hypnotist or magician, seance magic, etc.
-I would also include a lot of links to more skeptical content, how to tell a good bigfoot track from a bad track using anatomical information and inference, stuff like that. 

This isn't to say that we couldn't still post about these topics, that alien life may be visiting the planet Earth, that Atlantis may have existed (and other unknown civilizations), and other sorts of things. I just think we should try and do more to get away from things that have already been explained or debunked, and try and find more hard paranormal evidence and cases of things that have not already been debunked. What would you all put on a list of this sort?

tl;dr I think we should post a list of debunked paranormal phenomena and known/suspected hoaxes

1355457581.0,14tqb9,I live in a house that is over 100 years old..,Azumikkel,102,16,27,"..and I have been doing so for the whole 17 years I've lived. During my time here

I would like to start out by showing you two pictures.

[This is the hallway outside my room.](http://i.imgur.com/ot47q.jpg)

[This is my room seen from my bed.](http://i.imgur.com/nwUDQ.jpg)

Why do I show you these pictures? I'll get to it. Before telling you why

We have several housecats living in the house. It hasn't happened much recently, but there would be nothing other than an empty wall, a piece of furniture, sometimes the ceiling. The cat would act threatened, raise the hairs on its back, hiss and growl. Then it would run into the kitchen or entrance room to hide. If there were other cats around, they would look at the same thing as the first cat and growl.

Since this is a pretty old house

Once in a while, or a light object such as a piece of paper might soar off a table. I only consider these occurrences odd when there is no wind to push it, nobody is near the item, and nobody has touched it for hours or even days.

We have a lamp in our front yard that has a sensor making it turn on for a little while whenever something moves. You have to make some pretty heavy movements before it turns on. The light turns on way too often when everyone's in their beds. 

If I have my room's window open at night

This isn't something paranormal and I'm sure it happens in a lot of houses

Now, letting you look at the big window behind it which reflects a little blur of the lights in the hallway. The view on the image is what you see every time you walk up the stairs. The hallway makes you feel very unpleasant, whether it's day or night. You get the feeling someone is watching you.

Now, and I never dared to go out there and check. It could be someone sleepwalking, but while you hear the footsteps go across the hall, you never hear the 'person' walk down the stairs, enter a room (my room is the only room near the stairs), or walk back into the room at the end of the hall. 

As for the picture of my room, outside the field of view. Before I resided here, my brother did. Both he and his girlfriend has mentioned getting nightmares in here, feeling someone watching them, and even hearing voices. After I moved in, I have experienced those things as well, except for the latter. My brother thinks it's our great-grandmother who's in the room. Personally I think it's one of the previous owners of the house. I don't know any history about the place sadly.

If you look to the right of my monitors, the window blows off its hatches and opens. I haven't really spared this a thought until I realized it only happens when I'm sitting in my chair next to it. Never once has it ever opened itself while I was anywhere else in the room, or not in the room at all; I never returned to my room to discover the window having opened or the hatches being off.

Now to the most peculiar part. A couple nights ago I had been trying to sleep for hours. Out of impatience and for being warm, facing the wall. I felt something was wrong and got the urge to turn around, so I rolled onto my other side. I saw something transparently white standing in front of my closet. The room was so dark, whatever it was, it was extremely hard to see. I'm still not sure what it resembled. It looked like something much lighter than fog, shaping what I think was a woman wearing a white dress, slowly swinging it from side to side. I was scared at first, she would have done so already. I tried looking around the room in case it was just some smudge on my eye

I considered whether I was sleeping, I only see the details I expect to see, I have a strong urge to close my eyes, I see things from the inside of my head and not through my eyes, and I only feel temperature on my hands and face. When this happened I was as fresh as DeAndre Cortez Way, nothing weird happened other than the white fog and I was getting chills.

When I eventually fell asleep after that

1. Uncle's best friend died of cancer. Right before he passed, my uncle could sense his friend was there (in the SHOWER, of all places). Waiting for something to happen, he suddenly heard his friend yell a joke that was only between them right in front of his face, in the shower. Yea, it freaked my uncle out, but he knew his friend was alright. This gave me the chills when he told me about it

2. Parents have seen a UFO. Not necessarily aliens, pulsating lights"" was floating past their apartment, humming and staying at exact elevation as it passed. Apparently it was too soft to be turbine-powered and too loud to be a cloud (lol'd at this, but how else would you describe it?). Bottom line, it wasn't a weather balloon and it certainly wasn't a plane that existed 20 years ago. The way my parents described it was that it just didn't seem possible when it moved. I've always been fascinated with that story as a kid and adult.

3. Hours after my grandmother died, fell from their positions sequentially, like someone was STUMBLING AROUND THE ROOM. To this day my family believes it was my grandmother getting used to her spiritual form while revisiting her home.

4. Before my aforementioned grandmother died of a brain tumor that plagued her for months, the room got cold and as she was looking around, she noticed that the clock had started flashing. The time had frozen on 8:12. Though my mom says she didn't hear anything, she felt that my great-grandmother was telling her that that date meant something. later that month, on the 12th, my mom's mom died. The month was August. 8/12. Fuck me.

5. My mother would tell this one better than me, let me say that my grandparents were extremely religious; my parents no so much. Anyway, Larry approached my mother and started talking about life, God and feelings. Because of his emotional aura (in other words, the presence about him), my mom wasn't intimidated by Larry, which she didn't understand till his departure. When Larry was done discussing with mom about her dying mother and recovering sister (we are unsure how he knew about them), and Larry the angel was gone. Now, sitting in her car and thinking about her dying mother, HUH?"" from her BACK SEAT OF THE CAR. Wiping the tears away

6. By now you've probably gathered that my mom has had some WEIRD shit thrown her way. Well, my dad and her were in their new house. My mom was napping on the couch while my dad was cooking. All of a sudden my mother sat up, looked at dad with shock in here eyes, and said ""Tim... Jeff's father just died."" They got the call later that night.

7. Holy balls, the family was in a wreck and he was suddenly a lone father. Her name was Linda. On the night of Linda's death, my mom woke up (she was NOT dreaming; she WOKE UP) to see Linda as a glowing, peaceful apparition staring at her from the end of the bed. (This shit freaks me out, man). According to my mom, Linda's eyes communicated to my mother that everything was OK and that the family didn't need to worry; just take care of her daughter and husband (sounds cliche, but that's what happened). She then disappeared

8. When my parents were moving around the countryside in the Midwest trying to find a nice spot to raise me, said my parents. Anyway, they both stayed on the ground floor, sleeping on the hard wood with only sleeping bags. I was in a cradle in the corner next to them. There happened to be an air vent next to my parents' heads as they lay there in the awful summer storm, trying to sleep. After a bolt of lightning that shook the house, a scruff voice emanated from the vent: ""THIS IS ONE HELL OF A STORM WE'RE HAVIN!"" My mom looked at my dad and said, and I quote, holy fuck

My first few days were fine; I didn't really experience anything. The next couple of days I would notice little things like doors being opened that weren't, and a hearing a few noises in the background. I usually put on my headphones while cleaning, so I didn't think about it much about the noises. These things happened only once or twice, so I never brought it up to anyone because I thought it was just me. The thing that did cause me to freak out a bit was what was happening in the women's restroom. Since I started, I noticed that the paper bag from the women's feminine hygiene trash compartment was always missing from the first stall, but when I would come back to put another one on, it would reappear. At first I thought I was being forgetful, I went to the restroom but I still had my cleaning gloves on so I threw them in the compartment. I took my break
So last night I brought up what happened to me to my supervisor. I was expecting her to think I was crazy, ""I'm sorry I haven't mentioned this earlier, but yes, things happen in this place. I didn't want to tell you anything because I thought you would quit."" Apparently many people have left running from this place from experiences that have happened to them, including one who had a panic attack and passed out on her first day. During our break, everyone shared their experiences and each floor is notorious for a different activity and they mentioned that the basement was the worst, so that's why we all clean it together.

When I was 14, and stayed at the Yogi campground there. But that particular year, we decided we wanted to try something different. We stopped about half an hour outside of town at a truckstop and gathered up some pamphlets showcasing our options. One of the nicer looking camps was tucked away up in the mountains, just like we like and had some really competitive prices. I wish I could remember the name, but it was a long time ago. (""Star-something"", maybe?) The pamphlet had the worst directions ever. Honestly just something like ""turn left and follow the road"". But the price was good and it looked nice, so we turned left and followed. 

At first, we began to note how empty this road was. No turn off streets, no oncoming, no stores. But it was a real mountain road, all twisty and not a lot of shoulder, so what do you expect? Then we found some road construction- all abandoned. Cones are out, bulldozers and backhoes are there, we spot a gas station. Thinking we can get an idea of how far it is to the camp (it seemed like we had been driving forever), some new. Some even in the bay to be worked on. The store was locked up, went on

As we rolled in, trailers, cars, tents. Everything you would expect to see in a campground. But not a soul in sight. At first we thought it was just a slow night, and as we rolled under the big welcome sign we began to check it out. At this point we still thought we might be staying there, and we were scoping it out for a good spot. The camp was in the shape of a 0, with the entrance and exit at the tip of the 0, we noticed the pool. It had obviously been left full over winter. Very unusual for such a cold place. But there were cracks all over the concrete, they would have left the same tracks. And we started to see this place for what it was. Deserted. That's the only way to describe it. I realized that even though all the vehicles were present, trunks. Old cars

The front office looked like any other from the outside. Just a cabin with a big welcome mat, with windows open, including this drive-thru one. The only light came from an old school jukebox sitting in the corner, just glowing away. My dad yelled for someone, and no answer came. He yelled louder, really trying to get some answers, and then that damn jukebox kicked on. One of the creepiest things that ever happened to me. As the only source of light, yet again. All the equipment and road work was still there

The next morning, and hopped in the car. I was the navigator, so I went to pull out the pamphlet from my little folder, and it was gone. My dad thought I just lost it, but I KNEW I had put in there the night before. He was upset, and we shared words about being careless, but he was so gung-ho to find the place that we decided to drive back to the rest stop and retrieve directions. So we drove all the way out there, it was a nice stop and the spots were all stocked. It just wasn't among them. We tried to find the road again, with houses to either side. Maybe it was the wrong road, just the creepiest place I've ever been.

Once when I was in college, but eventually I could make out distinct but oddly distorted alien whispers. I could see under the desk from the bed, and obviously no killer was hiding there, but there were definitely muffled voices coming from inside the room.

After ten minutes of listening, but they were certainly real. Armed with my Swiss Army Knife, I investigated! (I'm not sure about ghosts, but Fey don't like iron blades... well, at least in D&amp;D they don't, so I figured I had the upper-hand :). 

It turned out that my desktop's surge protector had a crappy little speaker on it for beeping when it gets hit by a surge, that night every variable fell into place for the surge-protector's circuitry to pick up radio traffic. The speaker wasn't meant for any thing besides ""*beep!*"" so it mangled the words pretty badly. Nevertheless, if I put my ear up to the speaker I could make out distorted English. After the voices discussed local road features and used ""over"" to end sentences, I figured it probably wasn't ghosts... Moving the surge protector a few inches lost the signal and I wasn't bothered again.

He stands outside my door and I have seen him plain as day. The woman however, is never inside and frightens me...

Now, hopefully not much longer). My dad asked if I had *seen* anything in the house, I was surprised. He described hearing someone in the house in the middle of the night. He knew it wasn't me as I was 1300 miles from home and my little brother lived 4 hours away. He thought either someone broke in or my brother had come home without letting anyone know. He got up (in his underwear) walked through the living-dining area and down the hallway as he saw someone go into the bathroom. He was freaked out when he turned the lights on and my brother wasn't there.... He goes back to sleep. Then as he is laying there, he looks out his door (the master is off the living room) and sees someone pass through the dining room and go down the hallway *again*. He jumps up throws on the light, my mom is freaking out and again... No one. I have been validated. I am not the only one who has seen this man!! Then he goes on to say he saw a woman walk pass the dining area (has 4 large windows) outside and when he went outside no one was there.

A few weeks after she died I was sitting in my room when I heard the sound of a dog whining at the back door, feeling sad, and figured I'd heard some distortion of the neighbor's labrador next door.  I sat back down and carried on, when I heard it again.  It was definitely at the back door.  I thought perhaps someone had brought home a lost dog - it's happened more than once - so I ran to the window and tried to get a good look at the back door, but I saw nothing.  I sat down confused and then heard it a third time and then I heard my brother yell ""DOG!"" like he always did.  I ran to my door and swung it open just in time to meet face to face with my brother, who had apparently had the same reaction.  ""You heard Dog, right?

I'd say thats the thing I notice most myself. I have seen a figure in my peripheral vision and dismissed it as my fiance, then looked up and not seen anything.

We have a newborn son. One time, sounded female or like a little girl, and was almost in a mocking or mimicking tone. I registered that it happened and wrote it off. However, a few days later, without prompting my fiance mentioned that while I was at work she heard him cry and then heard a second cry immediately after. This time she was in the far bedroom across from the bathroom. She just about freaked when I told her I had heard something similar happen days before.

Without prompting from me she said ""that apartment is haunted. In that last bedroom down the hall. No one has lasted more than a year there."" It turns out the former occupants of our apartment had a daughter that was a friend of hers

Odd thing is

Where do I go from here? I am somewhat interested in ""reaching out"", my fiance is a non-practicing catholic. We are open to suggestions.

At first I just dismissed it as a mere wrong number. He was so adamant in his vain attempt at inquiring info on the previous telephone number owner and he kept going to the point where we had established a little rapport through our strange dialogue. 

First call. It's a number and a voice that's completely unknown to me. Mid-20s

Later that day he calls a second time. Still seeking the aforementioned person. He calmly states the number he's trying to reach one-by-one
I knew nothing about it and thus was unable help him. The conversation ended

The third call takes place the next evening. I'm vaguely annoyed at this point. His end of the line was swarming with ambient noise from a TV or something. 
""Oh
He sounded like such a genuine nice guy
I asked him about the noise in the background

""The Chicago Coyotes against the Vancouver Birds. The two giants are clashing!"" He said enthusiastically. 
I know nothing about ice hockey
""So
""The service for the 'ports'?"" he asks
""You mean the cellar phone network?"" I replied
""Everyone just calls them portables. Cellar is a technical term"" He said mirthfully.
""Huh, or maybe they say 'mobile' up there. Where are you from anyway?"" I asked
""Illinois. Teiloj(or 'Teilhoj')"" He repleid
""Oh
""It's a city in the north western region. It's actually rather well-known"" He said

What was left of our talk was just chit-chat and more awkward miscommunication
I was sitting down at my desk during the whole duration of the call. Out of curiosity I googled this place he mentioned
I made a search for those hockey teams as well, I dialled it a week later, some elderly man picked up, certainly not him.
The ""well-known"" city really captivated me, nothing shows up.

To be honest I laugh and scoff at most ""paranormal"" occurrences I read or hear. But this experience was enough to make me into a full on believer of the unknown. Well

Ok so recently we had just moved into a new house in Burbank and we have been in the process of unpacking and setting furniture up around the house and what not. My brother and I have been in charge of moving most of the heavy stuff up stairs and basically just making the house look homely. But about three days ago I was picking him up from work to come back to the house with me because the cable guy was coming by to the new house and one of us had to be back there to meet him and let him in and show him where we need what not. As we are pulling in to the house my brother tells me he wants to check the shed for a rake or to see if we even brought it from the old house. He gets out of the car first and opens the side gate leading toward the backyard. I'm left in the front about to walk inside the front door until I hear my brother say "" Bro what are smiling at?"". Which confuses me who hes calling bro and who hes talking to in general since we're on opposite ends of the house. Puzzled I go through the living room through to the back and I see hes running towards the door and as he sees me he stops

He says "" How'd you get inside so quickly?"" 

I tell him I walked in through the front and heard you talking whats wrong? He tells me to stop fucking with him
""Dude I know you think this is crazy but you were standing right on the  deck just smiling at me. You wouldn't stop smiling"". I tell him to relax and I was inside but then he grabs me and says "" I swear you were standing right there (points at our deck) and you were still, thats why I was chasing you"" At this point I know when my brother is serious and when hes joking and hes completely frantic trying to convince me that I was there. I've never had or heard of an experience like this but my brother tells me they are called ""Doppelgangers"" and that they are omens of bad luck or whatever google told him. The cable guy didnt come until at least 40 minutes after all this and my brother approached the guy with the question if hes ever had this kind of experience and he looked at us like we were crazy or high.

Tammy would have me over to her house after school. Her mother was always home with her brothers and would serve cookies and milk which was a real novelty to me as I was a latchkey kid from a single parent household. It was late May when I went to Tammy’s house after school. 

I called my mother at work to let her know where I was then proceeded to play with Tammy and her brothers. Another friend of hers came over to play and started talking about how his dog had had puppies and everyone decided they wanted to see them. The house with the puppies was a street over

The dog was awesome and the puppies were cute

A little boy with the strangest blue eyes was standing there staring at me. He was terribly pale and looked very sad

He seemed almost fearful as I walked up to him, meeting my gaze in a way I was unused to and I had to say I was slightly unnerved because it was such an intense look.

“Would you like to come over and play with me and my friends? The dog just had puppies and they’re really cute.” 

""I can’t” he told me as his expression saddened. 

“Why not?” I asked. 

“Because my dad is in prison

“I’m sorry

Later that evening I was still bothered by my interaction with the little boy. Something just didn’t seem right so I told my mom about the boy. She asked me to take her to see the house as I couldn’t describe which one it was. I held her hand as we walked around the block then down the street then stopped in front of the house. It seemed to me to have a heavy feeling to it. It was empty. I expressed my confusion and my mother put her arm around me as we walked back home.

She told me that she knew the family that had lived in the house. She had worked with the boys mother. The marriage was falling apart and she had asked her husband for a divorce. He didn’t take the news too well so one evening when she was at work he shot and killed both of the boys and tried to kill himself and failed. He was at that time in prison for the murder of his sons. I remember being very quiet before asking my mom if she thought I’d talked to a ghost. She said it was very likely that I did.

I never went back to my friends house after that. I did babysit one time at the house on the other side of the house where the boys were killed by I wouldn’t look over at the yard. The house sat empty for a long time. People would move in stay a very short time and move out.

The last I saw the house someone was living there and the house seemed different

How could I have spoken to a ghost? I’ve not spoken to one since that I know of

I was with two friends at the diner and we were just sitting there smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee (which tells you about how long ago this was). No drugs

I was sitting opposite my two friends, she was probably out back smoking and talking to the cook. 

I was looking across the table at my friends who were at the time engaged in conversation, I don't mean that it wobbled or anything. It actually turned about 180 degrees and then SLID about 10 inches away from me, toward the end of the table. I sat bolt upright, and stared at the cup in horror and said to my friends ""Did you see that?!"" They hadn't seen it move. I told them what had just happened, and of course they were skeptical. Until it moved again. This time we all three witnessed it turn about another 10-15 degrees and slide across the table. This time it slid toward them, moving about another 6-8 inches across the table. Finally, a few seconds later, and slid back towards me

We were completely speechless at this point, and she said that it was the owner's wife, that she did that sometimes, moving plates or cups on patrons' tables late at night. 

I'm a born skeptic

* Nothing else on the table or anywhere else near us moved at the same time.
* All parties witnessing the event had their hands fully visible the entire time. 
* I inspected my cup thoroughly after the event and could not find anything different about it. 
* The table was completely dry and there were no drafts of air that could have moved it.

She has appeared on the show Paranormal State in 2009. I think most paranormal shows of its kind (ex. Ghost Hunters

It all started as soon as she and her husband moved in, came to stay for a while after getting a divorce. After the second night, Donna told her that someone had been watching her in the doorway as she tried to sleep, describing it as ""darker than the dark"" and that it looked like a ram. She said it told her not to be afraid and that it could help her. A week later she killed herself by jumping into a nearby river. The entity appeared to Deb right after and told her ""Don't be afraid. I can help you. I helped Donna. I can help you too."" This is all described in the episode of Paranormal State. I could go on and on but if you watch the show, you can get more of the details.

I also want to share some experiences not mentioned in the show such as what happened once when my mom's boyfriend visited, ""If something is really here, do something."" Just as he said that, his coffee mug started slowly sliding of the table in front of him. He immediately left after that and has never returned. Another detail about Donna's suicide not mentioned in the show is the fact that no water was found in Donna's lungs when her body was recovered from the river, showing that technically she did not drown. Of course there is always an explanation for these things but it's just something sorta worth noting. They once performed an exorcism on the house which ultimately did nothing. The priest who helped do it, refused at first. Saying that the demon sounded like one mentioned Bible, Azazel

I have always taken great interest in the paranormal so once he told me about all of this, I would ask to bring my video camera to see if I could capture anything and/or maybe have a discussion with his sister on video. I apologize if it seems like there are a lot of missing details or if any part seems confusing or incorrect but my mom's boyfriend doesn't like to talk about it that much so it's all I've gotten.

I like to take my dog out on late night walks around 10 or 11

We sometimes see creepy stuff at night, however was a bit different. I was walking the dog up a hill and I notice that he'd perked up quite a bit, and was quietly woofing and panting in the direction of a house about 40 feet up the street. I looked up and saw this strange, large, hazy white thing rapidly circling around the house. It was white, and was flapping? I think, but not in a way that a bird would. The creepy thing about this is how hazy the memory has become

Anyway, somehow I don't remember, I'm not sure. When I say this thing was big, I mean it. It was definitely about a meter tall vertically, and maybe less than a foot wide. It seemed to be flapping but with its ""wing"" facing the ground so it's on its side. It definitely wasn't a bag, because it repeatedly circled the house in these wide swoops. The best answer I can give is a disabled albino mega-bat that decided it would cruise around a random suburban house and then disappear. 

What gets me is how hazy it looked, swooping around and around in the dark.

What could it have been? 

EDIT: I made a shitty animation

EDIT 2: So it's looking like it might be a white ray (the sea dwelling kind) cryptid, I'm going to walk the dog now so I'll be on the lookout.

My old house, was haunted. My uncle shot himself when I was very young and my mom took it very hard. She spread some of his ashes on his old drum set that was in our garage, and placed the vase with his ashes on the mantle of the fireplace in the living room on the other end of the house. Every day after that the house had a different feeling. There was an energy there that hadn't been there before. Every single person that walked into my house saw things in their peripheral vision that wasn't there, or would feel an unexplainable cold come over their body. There was always a distinct feeling in the house that you weren't alone and everyone felt it. I remember babysitting my little sister. She was knocked out on the couch while I watched tv in the living room. I saw shadows moving in the kitchen all night. The electronics would flicker and the tv would randomly shut off. This went on for years, but it was never threatening. It was almost comforting. Until... During the summer one year the spirit changed. The energy changed. It was darker. We would hear voices saying ""Leave"" and ""Go"" throughout the night. Clawing noises against the walls were heard by everyone in the house. Objects would inexplicably fall. I remember watching a bottle cap crawl up the wall in the kitchen. Then it got worse. Every single night for weeks one of us (2 sisters, mother, father) would wake up with a dark figure with long, but this figure didn't seem welcoming. The figure whispered ""leave"" the 2 times he appeared to me as I slept. This went on for 3 weeks

For those of you who have no idea what the living hell I'm talking about
 
First, there was no shortage of booze to be found and we were able to slip in without too many confused old people mistaking us for their grandchildren.
 
Before my friend and I went there, we decided upon this fail-proof plan: 
 
**STUPID PLAN:**
* Step One:  Go over to the party
* Step Two:  Get neighbor's son **really** drunk.
* Step Three:  Get neighbor's son high.
* Step Four:  Hope that he tells us something.
 
Like I said:  Fail-proof
 
As the night progresses we find the opportunity to pull him behind the pole barn to smoke a joint.  I don't smoke anymore, so I don't think we we did a great job.  This is basically how it went down:
 
Me: ""So
Roommate: ""We need to hang like this more often.""
Neighbor:  ""I'm doing okay.  You guys are over here trying to get me fucked up.""
R: ""Yup...""
Me: ""You've got to handle family get-togethers some way
*At this point
N: ""Yeah.  What's up?""
*I hate physically intimidating people, and stepped in his face.*
Me: ""What the fuck happened last Sunday?""
N: ""What?""
*We both stared each other down for twenty seconds, and he's drunk, but he keeps shifting his gaze off to the side*
RM: ""Man
N: ""To what?""
Me: ""To what happened last fucking Sunday!""
*My friend got in between me and my neighbor.  I was getting unnecessarily mad.  Looking back at it
RM: ""Even I know you're lying, and you fucking did something!""
*Now it's my turn to try to calm my roommate down.  He doesn't get angry
N: ""STOP!""
*If this was a movie
Me: ""Tell us.  We're going to find out whether you want us to or not, who think they're going crazy.""
 
I don't remember exactly what he said, redneck-type kids.  Working on cars, riding four-wheelers, etc...  His new group of friends, however, really liked drugs (I'm not talking pot, here, smoking crystal meth (He actually said ""Tried, liked leather, wanting to witness something paranormal
 
His parents had caught him right after Christmas performing some type of ritual with his new group of friends.  His parents gave him an ultimatum:  Move out and keep hanging out with your friends, in the middle of the night.  He told us he continued to practice until his parents found out, again, and cut him off from everything.  I wasn't exactly sure what he meant by that, but my best guess would be that they used to pay for his phone, car insurance, etc.., using the small amount of money he makes at his job.
 
This was a **huge** turning point for me and my friend.  We weren't losing our minds, but he said he stopped meeting his friends and practicing witchcraft in mid-January and vehemently denied doing anything that weekend, other than work.  After he told us everything, we spilled what we knew onto him.  I told about my encounter with *him* in the woods.  My friend told about his encounter with *him* at his house next door.  I told him about feeling like I was momentarily sent to another dimension, the reverse-weightless feeling I experienced, the time-travel or ""slip"" that put me down the trail so fast.  By the time all three of us were done talking, we were shaking from head to toe.  I could almost feel the adrenaline coursing through my veins.  I could feel the blood rushing in my ears, but we didn't mean any of it.  We just wanted to get back to our home
 
After analyzing everything that happened over that week, multiple universe theories, drugs dispersed into the air, schizophrenia, to my own physical and mental health.   I've always speculated that there is some type of ""under current"", if you will, of energy coursing through the world that us humans couldn't even begin to understand.  I think the kid messed with something he shouldn't have, and it's having it's fun.  

We both have also been seeing things.  I'm not saying we're seeing ""ghosts"", and our brains are just collapsing under the stress.  There are eerie connections to some of our stories, though.  For example, we both see something white dart around the corner in the downstairs hallway from time to time.  It always goes left, never right.  We both hear our names whispered in the house from time to time, as well.  I'm shaking thinking about that, because I'm having a tough time reasoning with that.  It's one thing to think that you saw something round that corner just as you walked out of the room
 
Needless to say, nothing happened to me, at all.  I didn't see any phantoms rounding the corner in the hotel I was staying at, I never heard my name being called, unless an actual person was saying my name, of course.  When I got back home about a week ago, I started seeing/ hearing things again.  
  
Just to make sure, we're going to tell him the majority of the things that are happening to us.
 
I'll try to answer a few questions that I remember before I start posting links to the pictures:
 
**Is your neighbor 18 or 21?**
*I get confused.  I know he's in his early twenties, and would've kicked him out if they caught him drinking before he was of age*
 
**Why are my neighbors having a party while their daughter is in a coma
*Because life goes on, but it does apply.  Also, it was a family gathering.  I know a lot of the family members went there to see how their daughter was doing.  Me and my roommate get invited to every type of get together they have going on.*
 
**Why bother mentioning your third roommate (The blissfully-ignorant girl)
*I mainly included her in there to convey how terrified I was.  I didn't want my roommate to go over to the neighbor's house until she had gotten home.  I didn't want to be alone in the house
 
**This isn't your first paranormal experience.  You posted a comment in r/nosleep about an experience you had.**
*That isn't a question, friend told me to post it in a thread because she liked it.  You are aware that there's a big difference between r/nosleep and r/paranormal, right?*
 
**Don't shoot your friends.**
*K.*

Now, but like you can actually see it on there. At this point, she's been trying to get this thing all hooked up for about thirty minutes. The tv is still only displaying static, and the audio hasn't come through at all yet. My little sister enters the room asking what she's doing, and then proceeds to set up shop a the coffee table so she can do all her homework. So at this point, its Cami (the little sis) in the living room, and my mom (in the living room, but out of her viewing range). 
My mom has just declared that she's finally figured out what she has to do

not even three seconds afterwards, that sounded closer to a growl than anything comes through the tv's speakers at an off-puttingly normal volume; not too quiet and not loud (like someone was in the room with us, but they were right where the tv is) And it says ""CAMI"". So, everyone hears this, and I look at my sister and she's got these saucer eyes and I'm staring at her too and I hear my mother from behind the tv mutter ""what the fuck?"" and then she pops up into my viewing range and says, ""Reye, *dont scare your sister*. She looks terrified. I, scared shitless advocating that it wasn't me. Cami, then sprinted to be with them. We all huddled on the couch together

It made no noise whatsoever.
 
After it had hit my mirror, and G did the same from the car behind.  It stayed stationary in the middle of the street, and just continued to bounce up and down a few more times until retreating back into the sky.  But the bouncing wasn't conventional at all, it forcefully sped up in both directions, almost as if it was accelerating back and forth in it's twenty foot span. 
 
We turned around because I was convinced that it was a basketball or something explainable.  There were no people, no sign of anything.  I checked the mirror.  There was no actual damage at all.  The mirror popped right back into place and the only evidence of it at all was a horizontal white line on the back of the mirror itself, which would, I assume, be the contact point.  The line had an almost powdery consistency to it, and upon touching it, it just sort of vanished.  It came off much like salt would come off of something - sort of vaporized into the air.  It didn't smell, nothing.  It just went away.

Events have turned more interesting in the last few months, there is a collection of DVD's just out of sight. These were all moved and nicely arranged on the kitchen table over night, my mother unable to find the culprit in my brothers assumed someone was sleep walking. She has also been speaking more often, the reason my father recorded this video was that she spoke and he tried to catch it on camera. He thought she had said ""I can't find him"" after analyzing the situation though where she continues to move things in that area of the house we've decided that she said ""I can't find it"".

I am VERY interested in anything anyone has to say about it.  I don't know what to make of it.

As I write this my daughter is 4 years old.  She is the sweetest

I am 40 years old
When I was 30 I finally hit rock bottom.  I went to a shrink

That was a decade ago.  I wish I did at 20 what I did at 30.

The thing about depression
You don't take an SSRI and suddenly your life is full of kittens.  You take an SSRI and try to figure out how to fix the shithouse you have created.  The SSRI's enable you to take control of your life

As such

And during that time between 30 and 36 (probably 32'ish

It was awful.  It drug on for months.  It simply didn't get better.  Thing was
As the depression got worse and worse

Till it finally bottomed out.
And I was suicidal.  I knew how to do it.  I just needed peace with myself about who I was going to hurt.

That night I had a dream.

Let me regress.  I don't remember my dreams.  I am certain I dreamed last night.  I am sure it was terrific.  I don't remember it at all.  In fact

Every once in a while I would have this weird ass dream
But with any constitancy they are the only dreams I remember 3 days later.

So back to the depression.  I had this dream.  In this dream my mother was standing in her kitchen holding my daughter and telling me I am a terrific Father.
The very next day my depression lifted.
Just went away that next morning.
*poof*

Sometime goes by

My Mother has held her in her kitchen and said I was a good Dad.

I don't know what else to say.  

To this day I still deal with depression.  My Dad died last Fall.  My Daughter is the cure all.  I feel like I have known her much longer then 4 years.",self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/17vnq9/i_have_a_story_to_tell_i_want_you_to_say_whatever/
1346336547.0,z2tbq,shouldn't have messed with the attic,bostonhaunted,85,20,66,"Using a throwaway and typing at work, etc.)

Not sure what to do, creaks and old house sounds. We've renovated bathrooms, added a pool, painted, plastered, moved stuff, and nothing has changed... until we messed with the attic.


The ceiling above our living room is supported by large beams, lift up the boards, and work on fixing the ceiling. The floor in the attic is raised, beneath is all the insulation. We started clearing out insulation and found some old things that had to be from owners long long ago. Tiny white children's shoes, cutlery, pantyhose, and a few sticks wrapped with string. It wasn't the first time we'd found old things.


Previously, spoons, knives, and most surprisingly-- a silver revolver. We kept these items for a couple years on display (I wish I had pictures) but they disappeared about 2006/2007. I've tried to find them but nobody in my house (about 4 other people) have any idea where they went. 


A few weeks after finishing up the attic the dogs start acting strange. We have a beagle and dachshund. The dachshund will start barking while staring up at walls like someone is standing there. Our beagle wakes up at 3am and runs around the house barking like a maniac and nobody can calm him down or keep him quiet. Both of our dogs have starting sitting and barking in this ONE area of the front hallway and won't leave. The beagle


One night


The next day, but we all know a dog doesn't *knock* high on the door they scratch at the bottom of the door. She wouldn't yell hello if the dog ""knocked"" on the door.


Two nights ago, a mattress pad, and a ton of pillows... but no matter what I do I hear what sounds like somebody in the dining room. Walking around, moving stuff, and the distinct noise of a cabinet opening and closing over and over. It's driving me crazy and I'm a little frightened so I crank up the television and go to sleep. 


About 3am that night


LAST night was the icing on the cake. Me and one other member are the only people in the house. We're watching TV and have it on mute during some commercials. We're talking to each other about how we've been hearing strange noises at all hours of the day and night. As we're talking the dachshund starts barking uncontrollably at the front hallway (per usual). I go over to her and she's looking up, with all his hair on edge. I angrily put them outside as they're barking was overpowering the TV. I got back to the living room.


At another commercial break we muted the TV. This time, we stay quiet and listen close. Another bang follows... and then the distinct sound of heels on a wood floor as it gets louder like it's nearing us in the living room. We're both really nervous and laughing/crying looking at each other. I get up to walk over to the hallway to see if maybe someone just got home and I walk straight into a wall of ice.


Literally, and to my right arm. 


I run over and put my hands on the other person and I'm yelling, my right is like ice!"" He stares at me and you can tell he's really freaked out. I'm honestly pretty giddy about it at this point, as it doesn't scare me as much as excites me. Did I just walk into something or someone? 


Is there any way to calm our house's activity? What do you guys think? I just wanted to share whats been going on with the reddit community! r/paranormal seemed right. 


Thanks for reading.

I'm drawing connections and I'm thinking whatever it is is female

So about 6 month's ago my wife, before I joined reddit.

I wanna post it on here and as well a link. 

So I had something weird happend at my house last saturday or sunday night... First off.. My Wife is somewhat of a medium. She see's spirits, so she is used to this kind of thing... Except she never gets this excited about seeing something. Me on the other hand, I don't ever see anything. All I've seen was an orb that lit our bedroom up one time and that was enough for me.

So anyways, and I were all sitting in the living room just hanging out. They were both on the couch watching tv while I was beside it on my computer playing a game. Now, the computer desk is next to our entertainment center, which I cannot see what's on the tv unless I move the computer chair back a bit. The placement is important, so with that said... I decided to get up and go the kitchen to grab a drink.(the kitchen is directly behind me from the living room) As I was doing whatever I was doing when I heard my wife and sister asking themselves outloud, ""Why did he do that?"" I then leaned over the counter in the kitchen and asked them what they were doing. They didn't see me initially and asked how I threw my voice from the hallway into the kitchen. At that moment my sister got up and walked down the hallway, which is on the opposite side of the kitchen. After she saw that I wasn't really in the hallway both of them ran into the kitchen and kept asking me if I went down the hall over and over, facial features

My wife thinks it is my father who passed away when I was around 3 years old. I am almost a spitting image of him too. Funny thing is he died when he was only 27 from throat cancer and I just turned 27 this year in May.. My close friend thinks it is my doppleganger... That Monday after this happend my grandmother called me to tell my that my Pappa

What do you guys think? Was I being informed of my grandpa? Does my Father have something to tell me? Or can two people that saw the EXACT same thing just be wrong??

1363809820.0,1aomxi,Tabloids predicted three events that came true in 1996.,vampedvixen,79,17,27,"Back in 1996

It must have been around the end of the year/beginning of 1996, a bombing at the Olympics in Athens, Georgia, and a plane crash in the Atlantic Ocean near Long Island. I put the magazine away, bought some candy and put it out of my mind for the time being because as much as I was into the paranormal, I didn't really buy into any real predictions like that.

There was a Blizzard in February of 1996, but I was more focused on the fact that school was canceled for a week and a half. Being fourteen at the time, the fact that the world was covered in snow and the multitude of snowdays given to us took precedence in my thoughts.

Then on July 17, Veronica, called me that day and we were chatting on the phone about random shit and then the conversation turned to the news. I took a chance at her calling me crazy and told her at that point what I had read a few months earlier. I told her that the blizzard was the first sign I missed and that there would be a bombing at the Olympics as well. We didn’t know what to make of the weird circumstances but decided to wait and see what happened during the summer games.

Even today, wondering if I could have done something to prevent it. I was just a kid then though, and I didn’t have much to go on (a blizzard in New England during winter? What are the odds? rolls eyes). I’ve been told since then that there were probably several people who read that same tabloid and were in a better position to do something, but it’s still kind of haunting even now.

I remember watching the parade of nations coming in on opening day during the 1996 Olympic Games. It was this weird feeling of dread

About a week into the games, and I was sitting in front of the television, watching the news coverage and told her that yeah, I saw it, and yeah, I knew it would happen. She asked me again how I knew and I told her that all I knew was that I read it somewhere.

Since that day, so I haven’t found much of anything in the past decade and a half. I haven’t told many people about this because it was just too weird. I don’t have many explanations for what happened. The only rational way I can explain it (other than the wild idea that these tabloids really do have psychics working for them, oohhh hocus pocus, and all that jazz) might be that since these things were man-made disasters (other than the giant blizzard, but like I said before that wouldn't be too hard to guess) that someone might have caught wind of people high up plotting them, tried to go to the regular newspapers and was written off as a conspiracist and the only newspaper they were able to use to tell the world were these tabloids.

I did have a shrink once who my parents forced me to go to because I was having physical problems the doctors all thought were caused by stress (found out later that I had cuts all through my intestines, but I told him about it because the anniversary of Flight 800 was coming up and it was on the news. He got this wary look in his eyes like ‘oh, she’s reeeeally crazy, I’m gonna have to prescribe LOTS of pills for her’ and asked me “So, you think you can see the future, then?” Apparently the belief that one can see the future can be attributed to so many different mental illnesses. I just rolled my eyes at him, because he clearly hadn't been listening to me at all. “No. I don’t think I can see the future. I think I can read.”

This continuous drag continues for a few minutes, though the landscape never changes much - only the physical size of the dunes seems to go up and down like regular dunes. In the distance I am approaching an old greek style building, quite wide though only 20 feet high. The roof is supported by what seems to be marble pillars that are directly connected to a roof of the same substance

1363922753.0,1as25r,Under the Tree with Granddad,glowinggoo,71,9,11,"First off, though

Like many people in my country, consisted of my grandparents on dad's side, my aunt, and my uncle. As far as I can remember, we always sat together eating dinner under his particular tree in front of our house. It isn't a well-lit area by any means, like most country homes in those days, and if we forgot to bring lamps it was normal to sit in whatever dim light we could get from our house, and look at the stars. This was way before the internet

By the time I went to college, and the cities are lit at night, so there's nightlife to go to, as well. Only my grandparents still kept to the ritual. So I wasn't surprised to see my grandfather sitting under the tree one day, when I came back in one of my few returns from college, and he waved me over. It was very dark, but I'd recognize my grandfather anywhere, so I went and sat there with him, and was unusually lucid

I did notice that there wasn't any lights on in the house, and now he's the only one to watch the house. I offer that we should go upstairs and I'll help him watch the house and open it up, but he said no, I most definitely should stay there and talked to him more. He was stubborn, so I complied.

It was around an hour later that my family came back, so I shot back that I was just talking with granddad so I was fine, and that *they* should be ashamed for leaving an old man alone to watch the house!

My parents were surprised and my aunt gasped. They just went to granddad's funeral.

I thought they were kidding with me so I turned back

He died earlier that morning, the 'main' part of our funerals lasts a week and it'd start on the very day someone dies.) I still maintain that I really did spent an hour talking to him, and the only explanation I can offer is that he was worried about me being home alone (this isn't a very safe country, especially if you're a girl) and that he wanted to talk to me one last time, since I was the only one he didn't get to say goodbye to. I'm a scientist and a skeptic when it comes to these things, but there.....really isn't any other explanation I can think of. A home invader/creeper pretending to be grandpa is out of the question.

I used to work in the hotel industry and left the profession for a year due to my course at university getting quite difficult for a couple of semesters. I came back into it looking to do some part time work manning the front desk on friday and saturday nights (Night Audit). A few things of how the hotel was built was that there was a car park level directly above the reception and main entrance area. Guests could only access it after calling the front desk and you would have to manually walk through the carpark to open the gated entrance. Nobody else had access to it except people at the front desk.

I was going through the whole on the job training when the receptionist who was training me told me some stories about the hotel including all the suicides they've had. What he told me was that on his watch he has had three suicides of where people have jumped off the balcony or fallen off and landed in the car park area. What I can't forget and has stuck to me is how he described the noise of them landing in the car park level. He said it sounded like a bomb had gone off and the whole reception area would shake for a couple of seconds.

He then told me about the incidents of staff (especially porters) seeing shadows and people in their rear view mirror when moving the cars around to make more room for other cars. There was one story where someone who had newly started working at the hotel and was called on by a guest to grab something out of the car for him to bring up to his room. He had only gone up to the car park level for a couple of minutes when other staff (house keeping) heard screaming coming from that level and someone running down the stairwell and trying to frantically open the door into the main foyer. Luckily there weren't any guests checking in at that very moment and he had collapsed on the floor screaming that he saw someone walk up to the car and peer into the window while he was searching for what ever the guest had asked him to grab.

1374703477.0,1izih2,The Grey in the Closet,AmonBriggs,67,10,13,"If anyone here listens to Mysterious Universe; they actually covered this on their Plus show.  It's been on my blog ""From the Outer II"" and is an account from someone very close to me.  I thought I would put it on here to get any opinions. I apologize in advance for using W as a name.

This story was the result of a friendship that had grown to the point where we felt safe telling each other some impossible things that had happened to us.  I recently asked this friend if I could actually interview him about the story for this blog.  It was agreed that I would do it if I kept him anonymous.  So

This story is about when W had an encounter with what he thought was a supernatural being.  It was a hostile physical form that appeared in his bedroom and disappeared without there being any way in and out.  The entity also appeared to control time and did not like light either.  He later found out he was not the only one to see this entity.  A friend of his also encountered it in a different location.  Sounds like a possible malevolent apparition right?

The catch to this story is that W’s description matches typical Gray alien descriptions.

This was when W was still a teenager.  He cannot remember the year

W had just gotten into a serious argument with his father.  Fuming

Frustrated from the fight, W couldn’t reach the cord in order to pug it back in.

W looked over to his closet and saw a strange face amongst his other stuff.  Thinking he must be imagining things

To remove any doubt in W’s mind; the eyes blinked.  There were no visible eyelids beforehand and they disappeared afterwards.

W officially freaked out.  From this moment on

As soon as he saw the eyes blink

The being was standing behind W while reaching out towards him.  It was about four and a half feet tall.  The entire body was thin.  The appendages seemed to be normal length for its height.

During this particular part of the account

Suddenly, escape the being’s touch, and run through the house.  There is no memory of any of it.

W was shaken to the core.  After telling his mother what happened

Two details did manage to get filled in later.  W didn’t remember screaming while in the bedroom.  His mother informed him that he began screaming from almost the time he went in.  Also

That would have been just enough time to see the cord unplugged.

W wasn’t the only one to see this entity either.  Unbeknownst to him

Among supposed extraterrestrial encounters

The biggest clue of all is the piece of this story that isn‘t heard much in alien reports

Also

This is not to say that there are not Grays coming out of obviously mechanical vehicles.  This was also only five miles away from Tuckahoe State Park in Maryland

Still

I also asked W if there had been any other strange stuff happening during that time since multiple phenomena tend to hit within a relatively short time.  The answer was no

My wife was about 8 and they lived there until she was 14 I believe. My wife, was named as such because there used to be a Native American presence in the area.

Anyway, went outside and looked on the lawn, and just couldn't find his keys. So he finally gives up, goes into his room and kicks off his shoes, and goes to the restroom. He comes back from the restroom and goes to put his clothes away and there are his keys... sitting in his right shoe. He was the only one home because he had early release from school and he had only been out of the room for about 5 minutes.

They also talk a lot about how their mom called the cops on multiple occasions after they first moved in because the was **convinced** that there was someone in their attic/walking around on their roof and talking to eachother. Every time, then heard footsteps and thought someone had broken in. She ran to the neighbors, called the police and her mom, and waited there. When they arrived, her room was exactly as she left it with nothing moved at all.

Her sister was once attacked while she slept, but didn't see anyone there. A second later, she was fine again, but was convinced that she saw someone while she first woke up.

Sometimes

My wife's mom kind of went unhinged and became paranoid that there were people coming into their home stealing stuff/moving stuff

Her family is very Southern Baptist and only talks about paranormal activity in a jesting way. None of them seem to think much of their experiences at their old house, Suzy, her brother, and her mom all discussed how weird that was because they all had recurring dreams about the house too... almost every night. None of them seemed to think it was weird.

Many years ago (2003?) my band played a gig in Waco, etc....very eerie.

I then heard - in my ear as if from the back seat - a male voice casually say ""You're going the wrong way."" I noticed that I was indeed going the wrong way down a one-way street. I said, out loud, ""Ok thanks"" and turned around...this road led directly back to the highway...I had also been going the wrong way in that respect.

I was so caught up in being lost I didn't snap to the fact that I'd physically heard a voice from someone who was not in the car. I asked my girlfriend ""Did you hear that guy say we're going the wrong way?"" She immediately burst into tears and said she had and was totally freaked out and then developed a bad headache.

In 1988 my parents moved into this house in a small but relatively wealthy town in southern New Mexico. They moved with my two older brothers, as this first manifestation was the catalyst for a lot of negativity to come in the home, which I feel lent the power for future events. 

My father was a very religious man, as my mother lay with my father's arms around her, she felt a pull arching her spine up, as though my father were trying to lift her from the bed. As she turned to ask what he was doing, she was perplexed to see that he was staring straight at the ceiling, eyes wide open and mouth agape in a silent scream. His entire body had been lifted from the bed and sat suspended a couple of inches from the mattress, his arm with her on it had followed suit. As she stared, he was thrown from the bed and onto the floor, sitting on the bed where he had lay. It beckoned him to embrace it

My brothers, often screaming in terror and sobbing due to the ""black people"" in their closet. Finally being fed up, my parents decided to spend the night in their room to prove to them that there was nothing to be afraid of. As the family doze to sleep that night, my mother and oldest brother fully falling asleep, a figure caught my father's eye. To his horror he witnessed several silhoutettes, identical to the one he had seen years before, manifest before his eyes. The brother who was awake began to cry as he saw them, except that their very bodies were darker than the dark room in which they sat - almost absorbing any sort of light around them. And eyes - he said that he couldn't see the eyes, asking them to step into their world - my brother panicked at this and screamed, questioning what happened. 

It was at this point that things really began to turn into a horror story around my house - the environment that my earliest years were spent in. My father, and developed an angry, irritable personality that lead to him and my mother screaming at each other for hours a night, broken glass, and a sobbing mother. The negativity and tension in the house was terrible, it felt like a constant humidity. It made the things that were now permanently called ""the black people"" far more active, despite the fact that for many months my mother refused to believe they existed. 

During that time a lot of poltergeist activity occurred - pans falling off of hooks, rubbing our legs. My mother gasped and shook my father awake - whispering to him that she could see someone around the bed. My father, a normally strong and burly mans-man, was a nervous wreck when it came to these things and immediately jumped out of bed - at which point the thing seemed to sink into the darkness. Once my father turned the light on, nothing was left. 

My father demanded that we move out of the house, we could hear voices speaking to us throughout the house. We couldn't leave as the storm outside was the worst the region had seen in years, and my father had taken our only vehicle when he had gone to the farm. My mother tried singing up lullabies and stroking our heads to get us to sleep - but there was no use, the walls themselves were screaming over her. The house trembled on its foundation, the footsteps rattled the floor as these things stomped. The candles wouldn't stay lit, something kept blowing them out - the flashlights had long since died. My mother held us so tight - she honestly believed that we were going to die that night. Then it came...I still can't remember it myself 15 years later, but my mother and brother describe it as a blood curdling howl. Like a woman screaming in pain or an ape in anger, praying for our protection. Hours were spent there until the thunder and voices and screaming stopped and we could see daylight through the comforter. 

My father returned the next afternoon, he could see fog against his windshield as through something were breathing on them. How one of the figures looked like an animal from hell, and how its face made him duck onto the floorboard - wishing he could be home with us. They tormented him too that night, but he refuses to say much of it.

After this point my parents decided to have the house blessed by a local priest. The priest came and performed his ritual

At this point I had turned 6 or 7, and make fun beeps and boops. I had been moved into the second bedroom at this point along with my brothers. This toy, weeks after having grown bored of it, began to operate itself. Launching random balls, making random beeps - it wasn't too terrifying as we wrote it off as a glitch. One evening as it sat in the closet refusing the stop beeping I complained to one of my relatives who was visiting at the time - the man walked into the room and opened the battery compartment - removing the D battery that powered it. As he walked out of the room, the toy made a new sound - one that to this day makes my skin crawl and my eyes water. The little s.o.b. cackled and turned his head toward my uncle, before the words ""can't hurt me"" came out of it. The memory is fuzzy at this point, but apparently my relative took the toy outside and smashed it before taking it to the landfill.

1369841764.0,1f9ugx,Moved into new home...,Keltaris,72,12,8,"Hi all


Thought I would post here to share some strange experiences in my new home.


First of all I think I should start of by saying that I’m quite sceptical when it comes to “paranormal” things


Secondly


So, we were standing at the old war memorial we used to go to for remembrance day every year, he told me that I had to find something, I’m sure at the time he gave me more detail but all I can remember is he gave me a name and a sequence of numbers which I think resembled a phone number, the name was “Gib Common” – no mention of if it was a place or a person, and he gestured toward a general direction nearby.


As it was such a surreal experience, or in fact anywhere. A few days passed and I dismissed it as being down to stress and that it meant nothing.


Fast forward to 6 months ago, as if someone was always watching you, it’s a feeling I’ve never felt before and my wife also shared the same feelings. There was one occurrence where it felt so much like someone was standing behind me that I turned around expecting to see my wife and yet saw nothing, at this point I was slightly concerned.


The same week, I was in the living room at the opposite end of the house with my headphones on playing on my PC, I was not on any voice servers or Skype so I’m adamant I didn’t shout anything or say anything she could of misunderstood for me speaking to her.


This same week I recalled the dream I had with my grandfather, things were certainly not adding up.


The day of this realisation is when we had our first (and to date only) physical incident, I was surprised to find the bulb hadn’t smashed when it hit the floor, so I went to pick it up and as soon as I touched it, it smashed. It was also strange to find that the bulb is a screw-in fitting, I can’t explain why a screw in bulb would fall out on its own accord, let alone survive the fall to a wooden floor then smash when touched.


I can’t remember the time frame, I don’t know why but at the time I had the impression that he used to live at the house many years ago, he was very angry and ranting at me, once sentence stood out in particular – “Is that all we are to you? People who share stories with one another?”, I don’t know what that sentence means, it’s not a phrase I’ve ever heard before.


When I thought things couldn’t get stranger, even if you approach the window they will still remain transfixed on the window. Animals vary from squirrels to birds, several birds have also attempted to peck at the window but I can only guess that this is due to their reflections?


By this point


Last night my sister moved into the spare room for a few months while she’s in-between places and I had another lucid dream


So, I just thought I’d share my experiences with you, the only other point ill mention is that neither myself or my wife drink, take drugs or have been on any medication, so I can’t link the dreams to that.

1. About 10pm last night I went to the bathroom and I could hear something really weird coming from the basin. On the basin there is an automatic soap dispenser that will dispense soap if it senses movement... it was going off non-stop but no one was near it

2. That night I went to sleep not thinking anything of it. I woke up at around 430am because I'd had a horrendous nightmare about who I would describe as, just staring at me, I was petrified, I couldn't see his face but i could see his tongue was protruding from his mouth and was violently contorting. 

3. The next day I'm tired and still thinking about how fucked my nightmare was. I haven't had a nightmare in years. When I get home from uni, it's not water.. i dont know what it is. It's darker than water, and there are some patches in my room where it is really dark. I can provide more photos upon request. http://imgur.com/7HMiqT8

In 2011 my mother and father both had experiences in a hotel room with some sort of entity. My dad had been staying there for ~2 weeks (he works in the film industry so he's in one of two major cities for weeks at a time, misery, and suicidal thoughts. My dad has *never* been like that- and I'm practically a photo copy of his personality (though I look just like my mom), and this is very, very abnormal behavior. He had been plagued with these thoughts endlessly while he was there, his only relief being on the weekends when he would come home to us. 

At some point my mom went to visit him during the week and stayed in the hotel room with him. She slept restlessly and was uncomfortable throughout the night. He left for work at 7am, it was just a strange idleness. 

At 7:30 she awoke to a feeling of supreme dread

Now I know what you're all saying, and he told her about his experience in the hotel. She left and occupied herself in the city, and when dad got off work, they went to the front desk to change rooms. I'm not sure if the attendant asked or if they volunteered the information, but they explained why, and they were told they were the fifth set of guests to have moved rooms because of negative paranormal experiences. 

As far as sleep paralysis goes... I believe that rather than a way to explain away and allow for dismissal of encounters, but that's what I believe.

1364314144.0,1b1q25,My mother is convinced something paranormal follows me,MagnaKendra,67,9,18,"Weird things began happening to me when I was about thirteen. My family and I lived in a house that we had built ourselves

It all started when my mother got pregnant with her fourth child. We got one of those plush baby toys that had the ""Now I lay me down to sleep, so I would come home from school and be home alone for hours before anybody else was around. At first, this toy made me really uncomfortable, and I would throw it in closets and close the door and not think of it until it was out again. 

Fast forward a couple months, other things began happening that I didn't relate together until some time after. My bedroom started getting cold. It was so cold that I put a thermometer inside of my room and just outside of my room, and the room was always about 20 or 30 degrees colder than the hallway. Also, my older brother started getting very mad at me for throwing rocks at him. I might have thrown a rock at my brother every now and then (who doesn't), but he was being hit by rocks so hard that they left welts on his body. It only happened when I was around him. These are just some examples.

None of these things ever really bothered me much until one night, but she was nine months pregnant and slept through most of it. When she woke up the next morning, the plush toy had its face shoved into the corner of her closet along with other things for the new baby. The closet was filled with various baby items from all over the house, but they were all violently shoved in.

At first, walk through the house collecting items, open my mother's bedroom door and her closet door, and proceed to violently throw things around. In a three bedroom house that has five people and two dogs living in it, as well as a guest, it wasn't possible for me to have done all of that without waking anybody. This incident always bothered me.

Fast forward seven years and I'm moved out and living across the state. Our seemingly harmless poltergeist hasn't made an appearance in quite some time. My younger sister has since moved into my old bedroom

To give some back information on myself

To begin

When we first moved in, my mother and I had our first experience.

At the time, we both saw what can best be described as someones pant leg swishing around the corner from the kitchen. It freaked us both out, and we looked around the corner, but nothing was there. We noticed the light underneath the bathroom door, and figured my stepdad had checked on us, then went to the bathroom. After about 20 minutes though, we shut off the water and could still hear him snoring..even though the light was still on. We brushed it off and that was that.

Over time, and then the TV would change a channel, or mute, or rise the volume to maximum (*that* was fun)... My mom eventually announced, ""We have a ghost!"" and fondly named it Henry.

""I couldn't find my keys for two freaking hours and they were RIGHT HERE on the counter! Oh *Henry*!"" .. You get it.

After about our first year there, ""Hey."" ... but she had hearing problems and would ignore it.

The way our apartment was set up, we would do a double take, insisting we saw a person in the master bedroom, either standing by or sitting on the bed. Every time we insisted it was a he and he wore a red shirt. We started to get scared more often, me especially as I'm very sensitive to scary stories.

My first experience alone you could say happened very early in the morning. I had woken up, but when I got out there, I could hear him sleeping in their bedroom. No one was awake but me, but I clear as day heard someone whisper my name.

A few months later, and his feet would dangle off the bed) ... everyone figured it was kitty, until my mom started complaining that her hair was randomly getting tugged when in bed, and she kept hearing a ""Hey!"" or ""Hello!"" while trying to sleep.

The final straw for me, about to drift off, when my stepdad knocked on my door. I opened my eyes and saw ... the only thing I can describe is.. the room was dark, but this was darker. It looked like a person, about 6 feet tall, and it rushed at me like it was going to attack me. I started screaming, kicking

I slept on the couch after that

Here's the interesting thing. I moved out at 22. I went back 2 years later with my fiance (now husband) to visit and meet my family. During that time, my mother, stepdad and I went to a sort-of family reunion, and my fiance decided to stay and get some rest for our drive home. Afterward, he told me that when he had gotten up to go to the bathroom (which is located between my old room and the master room) he felt like he was being watched intently. He felt uneasy, and when he went back to the living room felt like he was afraid to close his eyes and rest. Apparently whatever was there that I experienced was STILL there enough to spook someone who never even knew anything was there.

Anyway, and maybe had experiences as well. Looking back, Ive always wondered if there REALLY was a ghost there, or maybe it was just something faulty? A lot of our experiences and things we saw happened near the hallway and in my bedroom, which had our circuit breaker box right above my bed. I've heard before about fear cages and stuff?

I heard the shower turn off and the water running. I thought my Son had come home early from his re-enactment in Reading. I was pretty angry with him because I thought he had invested so much time and money into this group, that he was leaving them without support for the days' activities. I called out to him, but there was no answer. I heard the water turn off, then the foot steps went back down the landing and down into the family room.

Everything was gone from the scene.  There was no activity in the city streets.  Dead bodies and flower pedals floated in the river.  I got a huge sense of despair and abandonment....like this explosion or attack was so large

My father moved us around the country a lot so I was always adjusting to new places.  There are some things I remember vaguely and some things are so clear but I would like to be able to forget.   I was about 5 or 6 at the time
On this particular night my mom was working and I was home alone with my dad.  We were just hanging out watching TV.  My dad fell asleep on the couch and to this day I can’t forget or rationalize what happened next.  I remember feeling a little bit sick leading up to this incident. My show had ended and I stood up and looked over at my dad sleeping on the couch.  Slowly out from behind the couch a shadow crept up the wall.  It materialized into a figure.  The best description I can offer up is like a giant demonic humanoid looking rabbit.  It had big yellow teeth that were sharp and gnarled.  It had grey fur that was matted and had an oily sheen.  It rose to about 7 feet.  I stared at it in horror.  Its presence gave me an overwhelming feeling of dread. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.  I began feeling nauseous and dizzy.   It finally made eye contact with me gave me a really sinister smile and shrunk down to a regular shadow again. When I think about it
After that night things got real weird with my family and there was a lot of abuse specifically from my dad. I was wondering if anyone else has experienced anything like this or know of any demons that have a rabbit like form.  The abuse I suffered after that was horrible and basically ruined my childhood.  I still to this day fell uneasy when I think about it.

1369214729.0,1etpic,[Experience] It tried to take me when I was five.,alive41stime,70,15,28,"My family and I moved around the country a lot as a child. I was in Virginia when it happened

I am an only child

My bunk-bed was pushed against the far wall in the bedroom

So here goes... I went to sleep one night and was having a good old time in dreamland when I was abruptly woken up by a hand grabbing the top of my head. As I awoke I naturally jumped and as my eyes adjusted to the darkness, it just sat there a little bit open.

I swear to you, I was touched. I am sorry if this breaks some rules of this subreddit, but this story is not something I am making up or trying to write in the first person to give the impression of a memory, this did happen.

So let me explain how a small child deals with something like this.

I didn't call out to my parents, I would have yelled as a last resort. But I didn't want to yell beforehand thinking that whatever was inside that closet would grab me and pull me in before my parents arrived and I would never be seen again. I stayed up that entire night.

This is how I absolutely 100% know this happened and was not a figment of my imagination. I shit you not, very, bottom-end sliver of the pillow. Seriously, if that is not a symptom of post traumatic stress disorder, then I do not know how else to explain that behavior. I am thirty years old now and remembering that I used to do that, for years, is extremely bewildering to me now.

Because it was not comfortable at all. It actually made sleeping comfortably quite difficult and gave me years of neck pain and stressed joints. Neither one of my parents ever commented on it, with only the very tip of my head barely making contact with the pillow.

I can remember leaving that house in Virginia and moving to a new one. Almost as a learned habit

But I guess memories of that hand making contact with my head had not completely left my psyche. I spent the next few months training myself to sleep on the pillow fully like a normal person and I had to keep reminding myself that I no longer lived in that house and there was no longer a closet door next to where I slept.

I made me flash back to memories of needing to close that closet door fully every time I went to bed and then

And beyond this, maybe because you are much closer to your own birth. Maybe at four or five years old, I was attracting something and the strength on both sides actually allowed for a physical contact. I will never know its intentions or what would have happened if I was not a light sleeper and immediately woken up.

All I can tell you is that my bunk-bed was nearly seven-feet high

This is one of my first childhood memories. 25 years later and I can still remember how that touch felt.


**EDIT**: I have seen a lot of comments about the fact that it may have been a sleep 'jerk' or brain hallucination upon awakening. And I realized something. I did not emphasize the part about the closet door enough. I have actually had a lot of sleep hallucinations in my life, like an electric dragon floating over me, or a crazy black shadow jumping back into the corner. 

And I have also experienced the sleep tremor of 'jerk' where you wake up suddenly feeling like you have fallen, before I posted this, I seriously came up with the theory that I was experiencing my ""first ever"" sleep muscle spasm and that can explain the feeling of a hand touching my head (sleep hallucination) while being abruptly woken up (sleep spasm). But there is one detail I cannot overlook.

**The closet door was moving when I awoke.** And it was not a sleep hallucination. And if it was, trying to not make any noise. I watched the door slide into the opening, and since it was so slow, it did not make the final click, and then popped back out about an inch or two. It then kind of shook back and forth before finally stopping.

And it stayed like that. I watched it all night.

In every sleep-waking hallucination I have ever had

I've been living in this brand new house (completed Nov 08) for almost 4 years now (my husband had it built and has lived here since day 1). It all started with things disappearing and reappearing in the weirdest spots. Before we could even figure out what we thought of all that I had my first intense experience here. Basically I woke up about 3:30 in the morning to a mans voice saying ""Come and get me"". This was not a whisper or faint even

I can't ""imagine"" that. I was WIDE awake at this point. My husband is a very deep sleeper and since he had to be up early for work I debated waking him up. I look up from my childlike fetal position sucked up to my husbands back and there it was. Tall

Ok

Black Hills didn't know George, but the first talk of telling him to leave had him bugging our daughter and I got desperate. I conveyed to him that our spare bedroom (its used for storage at the moment) was his as long as he cut out EVERYTHING. After a few months incident free we were fairly satisfied that he accepted the deal.

Now my mother in law is having trouble in her relationship and there's been some talk of her coming here for awhile and staying the the spare bedroom. Well

After a very long time incident free, and once I realized what must have just happened I hear the little girl singing a tune. George started grumbling something but I just didn't quite catch it.

So now my mother in law is aware of our homes ""extra roomies"" and she believes but I HAVEN'T told her that the prospect of her moving here is pissing them off bc so far I'm the only one who has seen first hand that he's riled. I don't want it looking like the lamest excuse in the world for not having your mother in law move in with you! Seriously! 

My husband is adamant and personally I wouldn't care if it weren't for George. I simply don't want him harassing my daughter again. Ignoring him for now is my best option right now.

A little back story: When my wife and I started dating we were 16 years old. A few months before we started dating her mom passed away from cancer in her house. When her mom was still alive the house had been broken into. Her dad put an alarm on the house to help deter this from happening in the future.

Instance #1 When I would go over there, but we both heard the door shut.

Instance #2 While my wife and I were dating we were taking making out on the couch. We heard someone walking down the hallway and a door close. We figured it was her dad and I was a little scared, it still freaks me out.

Instance #3 My wife and I got accepted to different colleges and we would see each other on the weekends. While she was down one weekend her dad was talking about going to bike week in key west or some biking event. I asked him when he was leaving and he said he couldn't leave till Friday till my wife got there. I told him I could come by on Thursday night to feed his dog and let the dog out. He said o.k. I went over there that night and stayed less than 5 minutes. I felt extremely uncomfortable and heard footsteps down the hall. Let the dog out and I took off.

Instance # 4 We moved in after college for less than a month waiting to close on the house we bought. My wife coaches a sport and they were having their Christmas party at one of the parent's houses. I was at the house by myself hanging out watching T.V. in the bedroom. I heard footsteps down the hall and the dog walked out to the hall. I followed thinking her or her dad came home. The dog walked to the front door and was growling. The door handle jiggled and I turned on the porch light opened the door ready to kick some ass

Instance #5 My friend and I decided to ghost hunt there at my father in law's house while he was at some motorcycle event for the weekend. While we were there we were hanging out talking and heard some footsteps down the hall and I said, the creak?"" followed by the loudest bangs - bam! bamm bammmm! We walked into the kitchen and nothing was there. We knew it came from the left(the kitchen) and we walked around there for over an hour trying to figure out what it was. Her dad was remodeling and nothing had fallen over. We slammed the cabinet doors opened and closed, but it was not even close to the sound we heard. We even went outside and there was nothing out of the ordinary. We tried slamming down some boards outside, but the noise was to low for it to be it. (One of us slammed boards outside while the other sat inside). We couldn't figure out what it was and to this day I am baffled. Every time we go over there I still look around trying to figure out what it could be.

Any insight or explanation to what this could be would be greatly appreciated because I have no explanation!

I was around 17 when this happened. It was my junior year and my conductor had called an early morning jazz band rehearsal on this particular day since we had the day off the day before. Normally

When I walked in there I expected to see our chairs assembled in the traditional jazz band formation and most of the percussion instruments out, because, well let's face it, no one in their right mind stays in a huge dark room alone. 

About 5 minutes later (6:55) one of my conductors arrives with a handful of the other band kids and he smiles at me and greets me good morning. Once he draws his keys to open the two doors to the band room I mention that the doors are already open and he just chuckles and tries to open the huge metal door and it won't budge. I raised an eyebrow and he unlocked the door. Same thing with the second one and well I was at a loss for words cause I could've sworn they were open.

I grew up in a very old house in a small town in Northern Utah.  This house was deemed historical by the city and my parents purchased it when I was just a baby.  Now I have four siblings and come from a religious family who obviously believes in the spiritual world.  I have always been a very large non-believer in my family religion

Now a little more background, however we do know a little about the man who originally built the house, Eli.  Eli did pass away in the house and was apparently a dislike lawyer in my hometown before passing unexpectedly in his sleep in the late 1800s.  Before we knew the history of Eli, we began to make restorations to the house.  Shortly after starting, my eldest sister started to have dreams of a man who would give her orders about what needed to be done with the house.  As time went on, the dreams became nightmares and happened more frequent.  He began to tell her that my parent's were destroying the house and he would not allow anyone to ""soil what he holds so dear"" and to get out.  That is when strange things started.  (If anyone is interested, I will post another thread with some other stories

I have a younger sister who is just 2 years younger than me who, and this particular week it was his song, ""9 Crimes"".  She had a habit (much to the dismay of all of us in the house) to play the piano early in the morning before I took her to school.  (Note: Our piano was the one that my great grandmother used to teach lessons on, and was made around 1915.  She purchased it used in the 1940s.)

My mom and I used to get up about an hour earlier than anyone else in the house in order to do yoga together and get ready for the day.  One morning I woke up to my alarm which was set a half hour earlier than normal.  Now I have always had a habit of peeking into my younger siblings rooms which are on the same floor as me (the top floor out of three and an attic) just to check on them.  When I looked into my little piano obsessed sister's bedroom

By now it registers that my alarm was off but I shrug it off and take the first step down. This is when I hear it.  The piano was very faintly playing ""9 Crimes"" only it was different

I paused and listened for a moment and realized that it was almost as though two sets of hands were playing different chords of the song.  That was not my sister.  

I walked back up the steps and quietly peeked into my sister's room

I peeked into the room and the lid of the grand piano was closed and the room was empty.  I could see a lot of dust in the air as the sun was coming up.  When I told my mom she said that the same thing happened to her the week prior.

So there you have it.  Out of everything that has happened in that house and any other house since

I'm shaking like crazy right now.

This isn't the first occurrence. A few weeks ago a light turned on in the middle of the night.

EDIT: Sorry for the lack of details last night

I live in an older style apartment on the bottom floor. I have timber flooring and everyone above has carpet over cement. I also have two cats so if I ever hear footsteps I blame it on one of those two things. 

I recently got out of a LDR, my computer turning on by itself (though this could be a glitch and explained away), I heard my fridge open and close a week ago (but again there could be an explanation there) and more importantly, for about three nights in a row as soon as I put my head on my pillow to go to bed the pillow would gently move behind my head (I have experienced sleep paralysis so I know I wasn't asleep).

Back in early 2011 I was laying in my bed, my fingers were tapping, my shoulders kind of shrugged.. the body language seemed to communicate waiting.

I had asked: ""Is there anybody there?""

Immediately

Again

I asked whatever it was

I had asked a bunch of yes or no questions and if things were overtly complex I would get a sideways thumb for ""needs further explanation"". Basically

This ""possession"" happened 2 other times. 

The 2nd time it happened I had a pen and paper and it communicated with me that way.

I asked for it to prove itself and it wrote down a bible scripture. I went to go to my bible and opened up the verse (I am really sorry I cannot remember what it was) but the answer was always the same (I asked about 3 more times, that you should listen. It was usually something along those lines about a deity communicating with a human.

I remember in particular that there were things I needed to hold close to me

* There is an afterlife. It's very broad to talk about but essentially there are multiple layers to where one may go

* That coincidences are not always coincidental.

* That you should be nice to everybody.

* That everything DOES happen for a reason.

* That cynicism is nihilism is death because it blasphemies life. 

Anyway

If you have any questions

(I understand that this may be a common occurrence as even Santana talks with the arch-angel ""Metatron"" or something like that. I don't know.)

**What to consider:**

* It was not sleep paralysis. I was fully awake at the time it happened.

* No

* I do not have schizophrenia but I do have a mild form of depression.

* I have not visited any doctors

* There have been many coincidences it has pointed out. I recall back then that my friend would always pick me up to drive to our other friends house (a 2 minute drive). We stayed late and my friend joked about how our friend looked like a certain musician. That musician was on the radio as soon as we left in that duration of 2 minutes. I'd say out of the 40 times we've been to his place that this particular musician was on the radio at the time about 25% of the time.

There were many experiences that backed up that feeling.  

In contrast, I took the day off from work so that the furniture delivery people could drop off the couches and I could do some painting.  My husband was at work, so I was by myself.  After the delivery guys left, I decided to grab something to eat and relax and watch TV.  I turned the TV on and sat on the couch, but about three minutes later, the TV turned off.  I turned it back on, but it shut off again.  I thought this was weird, the TV in the bedroom TURNED ON by itself and started rapidly flipping through the channels.  At this point

When my husband got home from work about a half an hour later

The only other weird thing that's happened was that I was watching my cat playing in the hallway one day (there are no windows in the hallway or any light sources that were turned on) and she suddenly stopped and looked inquisitively to her left.  About two seconds later, teeny-tiny light-flash thing flew right past her.  She didn't chase it or anything, but just watched it zip by.  Very bizarre.

So, trying to drift to sleep when suddenly I hear the door knob to our bedroom shake, and then I clearly hear the door open. At first I thought I was probably about to experience sleep paralysis or something, but then my girlfriend reached out for me and tugged on my shirt with alarm, we froze. All of a sudden we hear the foot steps coming to our bed and we hear heavy breathing. At this point we're still frozen. I'm thinking, ""Is it an itruder? How do I fight him off?!"" It's like she's thinking the same thing, and we both get up

Since then I feel kind of uneasy. Last night, and I had one of those ""Live Strong"" kind of bracelets on, and for some reason I can't sleep with it on, and long story short, I took it off I put it on the bed to lazy to put it on the dresser, and I went to sleep.

The first event was about a month ago. I am married, etc. I also work at home and am pretty familiar with the ambient sounds of the condo (which is only a few years old) and the neighbors, cars, animals, etc.

So a month ago

I try to save power so it is usually pretty dark in the room aside from a spot light in the kitchen and outside lights (I am on the second floor). I have those three-tiered IKEA curtains and when I use all three layers

So when my wife was gone that night, but I just felt weird and my stomach felt sour. I heard a ringing in my ears, very high pitched. Not incredibly loud, but definitely obvious. This is not unusual for musicians/engineers, so again, I ignored it. 

So I'm sitting on the couch feeling a bit weird and had a shiver. I stood up because I was worried I was dizzy or light-headed or something

It sounded like it said ""Who.......................... are..................... you............."" with these one or two second gaps. Again

I just stood there drinking and ignored it because I refused to accept it was real. So I'm standing there a bit shaken but not too concerned and I start making this peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I remember everything about this. I was using this thick bakery bread with a bunch of seeds, I hear the same voice, only this time it is close to me, behind me to the left near the refrigerator.

""What.....""

When I heard it

When I calmed down, and I was happy to be among these teenagers with questionable aesthetics.

That was it until a week later. My wife was at work late. It was around 9:30PM. Again, no ringing this time. It was quieter but my brain immediately processes it as the same young female voice.

""Hello.""

I was surprisingly calm and a bit tired this time and thought I'd play a game with my specter or mental manifestation. I said ""What is your name?""

No answer.

I said it again. About five seconds later

Of course this freaked me out again. I panicked and ran out of the house 

Kind of like when I have to run to my car in the rain, and I grabbed the keys and sped away.

I blasted some talk radio and went to Wal-Mart of all places. I spent an hour wandering around and calmed down again

I read some stories and saw some REALLY whacky crap and clicked on a few things here and there. I was surprised that there were a lot of serious

Last night was the third occurrence and prompted this post. Since the last happening

A few minutes later

This time I screamed and dropped the cereal bowl and milk went everywhere. I opened my eyes and nothing was there. I cowered in the corner of the kitchen

I pulled myself together and cleaned up the mess

So what should I do here? Seek professional help immediately? I do take Prozac but I've been taking it for a few years. I drank maybe half a glass of champagne the night before but otherwise

I have calmed down

I could faintly hear her crying and saying something but I couldn't make out what it was. The lady was facing away from me and didn't seem to be noticing me so I walked closer to see if she needed help. I thought that maybe she climbed the rock by herself and needed help getting down so I called out ""do you need help?"" in Spanish but she didn't respond.

To describe them, blonde and blue eyed with her hair tied into a ponytail.  She wore a purple loose t-shirt and jeans and had a silver bangle on her right wrist.  The man was tall and slim, brunette with a couple days' beard on his chin.  He wore a dark green shirt with a dappled motif on the front and jeans.  The child was blonde, blue eyes wearing a blue t-shirt with fishes on.  He was old enough to walk but not yet old enough to speak.  His parents kept talking to him, saying his name: Charlie.

I live in a small town that's very touristy, and they knew too so there was only 2 degrees of separation between myself and the couple with the child.

A couple hours later I was at work on a check-out, smiling because I recognise them and ask 'is that Charlie?'  The mother gave me this really edgy stare and slowly says 'yees?' Thinking she's trying to place me, I say 'oh I saw you earlier in the vets; I was the one with the kitten.'  The man and woman looked at each other and say 'we weren't in the vets today.  We've been at the beach all day.'  Shocked, I explain that I saw a child called Charlie who looked like this child with exactly that top on earlier in the day and with parents who looked exactly like this couple.

Suddenly, making sure not to make a sound myself.  I glanced over at the blinds to see if they had moved, since just a year before there was a minor earthquake and I imagined that we might have had another.  But no, the curtain was still, but again, the door jiggled, almost inaudible.  This time

At this point

The door handle now jiggles with more tenacity.   Much harder and loudly.  Followed by severe pressing against the door *WOOMP WOOMP!*

From this point on

Now the door handle is being handled roughly

I'm now panicked

Suddenly the noises stop

After a few more moments, so I turn the handle as silently as possible, and let it draw open.  The hall is completely black, as is the rest of the apartment.  I slowly shuffle towards the entry door.  Locked, deadbolted, and the door chain still drawn.  All windows in the living room and kitchen are locked and closed.  Remember, this is also on the 2nd floor with no balcony.

The only thing left is the bathroom.  Door shut.  Again, and listen.  Nothing.  I open the door to an empty and dark bathroom.  The shower curtain is drawn shut.  Damnit, this happens in all of the horror movies right?  I throw it open, and nothing is there.

I turn on all of the lights in the house, and decide to return to my bedroom to try to sleep.  This time with the door open, and golf club nearby.

To this day I still get goosebumps thinking about it

I live in a nice suburb of metro Detroit.  There aren’t many large animals in the area, and an occasional fox or two for the most part.  It’s pretty a pretty tame area.

I was driving through the neighborhood leaving my girlfriend’s around midnight last summer.  As I was driving north on a street in the subdivision

It was moving EXTREMELY fast.  I don’t have a very good estimate

I immediately turned right facing the court

The creature was very large.  If I had to compare the size to another animal, I never saw its eyes or mouth.

When it ran past my headlights initially, or do anything that was directed toward me.  When I turned facing the court, I was only able to see the back of the creature before it disappeared into the backyard of the center house on the court and into the woods.  

Determined to get a better look, I kind of shrugged it off as just being a very unusual night.


**Now


I don’t remember exactly how many days later it was

As I stepped into my garage, stood completely still, not breathing, to assess the situation.  A few seconds passed and I heard and saw nothing.  I looked over to my right to see that the side door was completely shut, but something still did not feel right.

There are two vehicles that stay parked in my garage that are for summer driving only.  I look around and still don’t see or hear anything.  Then, “oh, it’s just a cat,” but then I realize that there’s no way any house cat in my neighborhood could cause the vehicle to move like that.  That’s when it went from scary to absolutely frightening.

As the car is shaking, most primal level and struck a level of fear I’ve never experienced. Even when I’ve faced life or death situations (held up at gun point), I’ve never felt this feeling. 

It was deafeningly loud and the vehicle began to shake even more.  The noise was more horrifying than anything Hollywood could dream up.  It sounded like whatever it was, as there’s SOMETHING in the garage and it’s extremely agitated.

I ended up calming down and going to sleep without really worrying about it.  When I woke up

I opened the door away from me very quickly.  Before I could blink, but moved faster than any animal I’ve ever seen in person (sans the other encounter).  It appeared to be the size of a medium-large sized dog (~75lbs), but the speed in which it was moving is inconsistent with any dog.  Again, it seemed to be moving over 40-50mph, allowing me only to see it for a few seconds before it was over 50 yards from me disappearing into the woods.

Again with the second encounter

It seems the mythology behind these creatures is a bit contradicting (omen of death, but now I’m worried I’ll encounter it for a third time.  I always felt it was unusual that it never looked at me, but now I’m thankful that it seemed to consciously choose not to.  Folklore says that if it looks you in the eyes three times, it’s a guaranteed omen of death.

So now here I am and I don’t know what to think.  I feel confident that if this was a hellhound, if it was able to manifest itself in the garage, why did it need me to physically let it out?  

Let me know your thoughts.

After her encounter with this 'ghost' I was alone in my room, I let it slip cause I though the A/C turned on, and I went to get a drink from the fridge, when I turned around I saw what my mom's room mate saw, this woman, who white hair but very young, and wasnt touching the floor, after about what I assume was 5 seconds she disappeared

Our house was a fairly new build, no horrible things had happened there and it wasn't built on a graveyard which makes what happened to me all the more frightening in my mind.

It was summer and my parents and their friends had gone up to the leisure club up the road for drinks

My evening went fine, closing all the other doors on the floor before getting ready for bed.

This is where shit started to get weird.

I had bunk beds at that time and slept on the lower bunk so I could sleep with my dog

The landing was empty.

I checked on my sister, shutting my door. Again the creak. I ignored it and lay back against my pillows, only to jerk back up again when the creak became two, then three then... it was footsteps. A bit freaked out and nudged the dog, trying to push him off the bed to see if it was my parents, he'd snuffle at my door whenever they came home. He wouldn't get off the bed and backed into the corner.
This entire time the footsteps had been treading a steady path in the hall. From the stairs to my parents room, the footsteps approached and then stopped. There was the kind of silence you get when someone is waiting to see if you're awake or not, but as far as I could tell, there was no shadow... no one was outside my door. I called out but there was no answer.

I sat there quietly freaking out, window and cupboard as I dragged the dog around by his collar.

Nothing. I let the dog go back to hiding in my room and checked on my sister again, waiting. The footsteps started again, this time at each door on the landing there was a pause followed by a click as the door was opened and shut. Once again the footsteps got to my room and stopped, waiting. I stayed in my room the rest of the night absolutely terrified, as soon as my parents got home I ran out to them and garbled the story 

""Oh

It happened every single time they went out after that, especially as that time the doors downstairs started to slam shut too. It got to the point where I would never mention it in the house itself, even my mother wouldn't talk to me about it in the house which made me think she'd had something happen to her too.

As fate would have it, electrical appliances all over the house started dying. Naturally, I called in an electrician but he said that there were no issues with any wiring or the like. Just bad luck, I thought. It was around that time the wife started having bad insomnia and nightmares when she could actually fall asleep, though she could never remember what they were about. She also started joking about Linda more often since she is paranoid at night and likes to try and lighten the mood for herself, going so far as to actually talk to Linda for minutes at a time.

Everything eventually returned to some semblance of normality until last week, and she said that she had arbitrarily named the ghost Linda. Then she shared a story that I hadn't heard before. Sometime after naming Linda while she was living in the house with her family, they received a letter addressed to Linda [their last name]. Now, that's a huge coincidence, isn't it? Mail ends up at the wrong addresses all the time, and companies will sometimes misname recipients, but to receive a letter at the correct address for a person matching the name of an arbitrarily named imaginary ghost is to much.

Three friends and I decided to go to the same college and live together. We found this awesome complex that had six bedroom apartments for college students. 
So we all drove our stuff down there and moved in
After we moved in my friends decided to meet up with this girl we knew but I needed to shower so they said they'd go and meet up and then have everyone come over. 
Everyone left and I got in the shower. I got out and noticed the hall and kitchen lights we on. I usually turn lights off during the day so it was odd but I though oh I just forgot to turn then off. So I went in my room and was just surfing the Internet. I kept getting this strange feeling that someone was behind me in my doorway looking at me. I would look back and see nothing. The feeling kept coming and was getting worse and started to freak me out pretty bad. I decided just to go sit by the pool and wait for my friends. 
They came back and they said the girls were coming later that night. So we goofed around waiting for them. I told them about earlier
Anyway the girls show up and one of them gets out of the car and just quickly walks away without saying anything. The other two came in and said when they pulled up she just said she had to go for a walk and that she seemed pretty upset. 
We are are hanging out and having a good time and after an hour the girl that ha walked away showed up. She had obviously been crying. We asked her what's wrong? She said why did they let you move in to this apartment? We just said well because it was empty and we had money! She said no
We were all freaked out. We stayed at a friends house that night and went back the next day. I was on my computer messaging someone about it. Right when I was typing about him killing himself
Still freaks me out thinking of it.
Sorry this was so long! 

TL;DR: marine killed himself in my apartment.

So, but the recent happenings have been very strange, I will now elaborate. 

Ever since I was a little boy my dad's mom (gramma), therefore that Christmas felt empty without her. Instead of having her, we had my mom's side of the family to our house for a massive party. My whole family, especially my dad was pretty upset except it was nice to have something to do on Christmas day to keep our minds off of everything. After our big party at about midnight (technically the 26th then) people were leaving so me and my dad started to clean up, he was hammered. At about 2 am I went downstairs to bed. Seeing as my bedroom is in the basement I can hear where people are in my house when they walk, and I heard my dad on the other end of the house in the kitchen clumsily cleaning up. 

This is where things start to get a little weird. Just keep in mind

I was lying in bed, inconsistent ticking outside my door. Not directly outside, just somewhere outside my room, with my door latched shut. Now, all houses make noise sometimes so I brushed it off as nothing. But every time I brushed it off it got more prominent, so I began to get a little anxious and freaked out. I said outloud ""Gramma, stop it"" and right as I said that I didn't hear any ticking for the rest of the night and haven't heard it since. I brushed this off as a strange coincidence. Anyways, so my blankets weren't on. But all of a sudden I feel a very cool air pass over my body for about 2 seconds, I had all of my blankets on after that. 

This is where things start to get really weird. 

I was on one side of my bed

It must be my dog

I turn on my lights and search the room high and low, who will most likely be able to explain all these occurences to me in the morning. 

Now

I was laying in bed and it was about 2:30 AM, that happens a lot when people sleep, I didn't sit up, I didn't move, just opened my eyes. My door, which was shut and latched (as in you'd have to turn the handle to open it) suddenly swung open. Not just opened, but swung right open. I literally just stare

After about a minute, stumbled downstairs, and walks in my room. He has no clue whats going on and the next morning hardly remembers it. I tried explaining it but he just bumbled off about nonesense, shut my door, and went to bed. 

The next morning I was so amazed

Fast forward to Janurary 8th. 

My immediate family (dad, me) went to Mexico. We've been here about a week. My mom finds some book in the condo we're renting about angels, and right once it's opened it says ""if this is in your hands right now, someone or something has put it there for a reason"". Interesting. It's full of stories about angels and new age things and such, you get the drift. She's attached to this book so whatever. That evening, I go to bed. My sister and I have to share a bedroom, but whatever. Due to a lack of power outlets I have to go to the washroom to plug in my Iphone. I plug it in to charge and go to bed

The next morning I wake up, I have over 200 more photos. I go through this and see that in the middle of my night, my phone took over 200 photos and videos, randomly. It was locked before. 

Not only did it take photos AND videos, some aren't. In a random order. And strangely enough, one is panoramic. I don't even know how to activate panoramic photos on my phone. 

I go through every photo and listen to every video (the videos are just dark with some noise), some have strange and infrequent tickings, and the most prominent one has a strange ""moan"" almost, I was able to get that video on my computer, it's saved as a .mov file, I will post it if somebody PM's me or comments how to. 

Anyways


I had about 450 photos before

I was freaked out

That evening, passed away suddenly from a heart failure. 

I'm not sure if that was a sign or anything, any theories just anything.

Over the 18 years i worked there i have seen or heard some strange stuff most of them upon applying science and logic were just some natural happening . but one has me stunned i have been trying to figure it out for almost a year now . i should also explain it is a 10 story building with 200 apts  built around 1921 I'm sure if the walls could talk we would hear some interesting stuff. As far as me I'm 50% open mined and 50% skeptic  but wanted to share my ordeal of what occurred  so that maybe someone had a similar experience or can explain this.

Around the holidays the building seems to have a high energy I can feel it  I 'm not sure about anyone else but i can . Shortly after the new year our building was installing a new passenger elevator . Right next to that is a freight elevator that has to be operated by pulling a big lever and due to the age of it and it being easy to get it stuck only our employees are allowed to operate it. That being said  the janitorial daylight guys took shifts to man it 24 hrs a day in case of a medical emergency and to take tenants up the 10 stories.  They kinda moved in to the  elevator  by adding a chair and a make shift table by stacking 2 plastic milk crates together.

One evening while taking a smoke break in the basement a co-worker came down and said the freight elevator is making strange noises so i went up for a ride to listen...what i heard was nothing more than normal wear and tear from the increased use. So i told him i would leave a message for the elevator company  to check it as they would be in the next morning to continue work on the new install. 
It was then i noticed my co-worker had a styrofoam food box on the milk crates I asked what he was eating and he said chicken wings but  it was just bones because he already ate them all ...I thanked him for offering me one (sarcastic) and told him to return me to the basement so i could finish my smoke break. What happens next is in a bout 2 seconds of time.

When we reached the basement i open the 2 metal doors to exit the elevator one foot is on the concrete outside the elevator the other still in the elevator when suddenly the elevator shakes violently i turned to look at my co-worker who is looking up and then moves his head in a downward motion  as if he is following something with his eyes  then a loud popping noise as if someone blew up a plastic bag with air and burst it.  the scary part is my co-worker then pointed to his strofoam food box and was  repeating oh my god 5-6 times before freaking out and saying I'm  going home ...i wanna get out of here .upon inspecting the styrofoam box the hair on my neck stood up dead in the center of it was a hand print  as if it had been burned into it (like a hand shaped iron was pressed on it) I know it was not like that before  and apparently my co-worker knew it also . 

There has been no strange activity in that area of the building since then . And i have conducted several experiments  including pressing my hand down on one of those styrofoam food boxes and then putting it in a pressure cooker but could not get the same effect .i was thinking a pressure differential may have caused it but I'm still stumped ..If anyone has any input I'm all ears

1

Example: ""back in the days when acid was made in college labs and it was pure

""I said

""We looked at each other and at the same time we said

My stepdad swears by this story.


2

Come on. I know a lot of people here believe that if you think about paranormal stuff it's like opening a door for them to enter your life and if you want it to go away then you should stop thinking about them. Furthermore


3

When I went to smoke weed, just long drives in general in places we had no legit business and they were new places we'd never been to or hung around at.


4

You were high. That means no one will believe you. Convenient for an entity that wants no one to believe you. Relevant to my story.


So that's my list of reasons. I understand that credibility is lost. I still think it's worth talking about. Most stories on /r/paranormal don't have credibility no matter how cool they may seem and even if evidence is posted

And even though we can't prove them


Heres my story.

Me and 3 high school buddies live in Vancouver

On this day

We are driving and we hear this wierd high pitched noise. We are on a secluded road surrounded by trees. The noise goes off an on. Everybody hears it. No discernable pattern. Its not any louder when the windows are rolled down and it's not coming from the speakers.

We finally get there. Its a beach spot 20 feet from a parking lot

Suddenly without discussion, ""what the heck!""

We are driving back and the high pitched noise keeps coming and going. Not fading in and out but loud or not there. 

We get to a stoplight. We wait at this stoplight for like 10 minutes. We all are bitching about how long this stoplight is taking

The radio turns on. It cycles through all the channels. The digital clock

The high pitched noise comes back and the light finally turns green.

we're all quiet again. my friend drops us off and none of us complain about the wierd fact that we didn't plan on driving for 40 minutes just to take one hit of weed.

i go in my room. i look at my alarm clock. it's like 3:30AM.

I live up here in Washington, and I felt a little uncomfortable living with him alone for a month, so I decided to bunk with my brother and his family who have PLENTY of room in their 6 bedroom house. 

Enough backstory...

The first day I stepped into his house to help him get the house livable when they had initially bought it, and always felt like there was some one in there with me. I always looked behind me because I thought someone was in the room with me, but there was never anyone. Made me uneasy, but not an evil feeling, just the feeling of being watched by curious eyes.

Anyway, upstairs, walking around, and especially walking down the hallway upstairs I would get fear cage very strongly, very dizzy, and get goosebumps. It started to really freak me out. I felt like the feeling followed me and was always behind me. I was getting super freaked. 

One day, this is crawl space that you can only get to from the garage. The upstairs ends that the door jam over there"" (and she points backward from our position about 10 feet) Then I got that fear cage feeling again. 

She begins to talk about how the house is legit haunted. She said they noticed it only about a year ago, or signs of animals. Creepy enough. She told me another story of how her and Aaron (my brother) were home alone with their 1 year old son (Max), and Sonia was supposed to be having a conference call with one of her bosses. Aaron went into another room so she could have her conference, but in about 15 minutes he went back into the room and says ""Oh  my god, are you okay?"" She looks at him and says ""What the hell are you talking about?"" He says ""You were crying... did something happen with the call?"" She said ""No, the call got cancelled, we never even had it."" They went and checked on Max who was sleeping upstairs, he was still sleeping soundly. 

Getting weirder now... But she keeps telling me stories. She talks about feelings that people are standing next to her while she's sleeping, and she had her baby walkie talkie thing on her night stand. She starts to hear Max wake up and cry a little. Suddenly ""It's okay baby, don't cry"" comes over ever so quietly, but it does. She said it was a little girl's voice and she flipped her bucket and high-tailed it into Max's room, where there was only him crying a little bit in his crib. 

So they end up talking to neighbors who have been there since the house was built

I'm flippin' shit by this time that she is telling me this. This is alot of activity. I told her how some of my things were moved, and that one day I went up stairs and the closet doors were open (mind you, these are the sliding 'accordion' style doors, so they don't just accidentally come open). Makes me uncomfortable, I tell her. And now there's a name for the ghost.. Nicole? She said to not worry, she 'talked' to her, and she's okay. I said ""How did you talk to a ghost?""

She starts to tell this story: So she downloads this app on her iphone that reads changes in EMF's. She thought it was something silly, and she hears the footsteps again. She decided to see if her app 'works', and puts it on the sofa next to her and she says out loud, ""Nicole, why don't you come and sit next to me on my couch?"" And this app comes up with 'words' that it 'feels' in the EMF, also. Now, the phone says ""Mine, it can be yours, everything can be yours, too

Well I'm good and properly freaked out

SO that night I go to bed. I hear stuff, and go to sleep. 

I have an incredibly vivid dream that night **Keep in mind this is a dream, that me and Sonia's daughter of my age, Holly, are upstairs in that room. We laying stomach down next to eachother on the bed looking at something on her iphone when suddenly we hear ""Don't scream"". We look at eachother and start to freak a little. I said ""What?"" Holly says ""I didn't say anything"". We hear it again ""Just don't scream, okay?"" Suddenly POOF there is a very solid looking young woman standing in front of us. We both are about to scream, mouths open and she puts out her hands with a pleading look on her face and says ""NO NO! don't scream, please!!!"" And we lay there like deer in the headlights, seeing that we aren't going to yell or freak out, I can choose to appear to you however I want. I could have come to you as a cat, but I borrowed your hair clip""

From that moment on, it must have been her trying to calm you down. She doesn't want to scare anyone, and she knew you were scared and tried to comfort you"" I mentioned that I did feel better about it, and when she makes too much noise I ask her to keep it down, and she does. Sonia proceeds to say ""Well, Nicole doesn't have to worry about me bringing in a medium. She is more than welcome here""

And that's it. Of course, things going bump in the night. And I feel her as soon as I walk into the house. 

Anyone have any thoughts on this? I'm at a loss. That dream was the icing on the cake for me. It was SOOOOO lucid. ",self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/13ny8s/nicole/

A block up and over is 808 Southard St. Most of the lots in Key West are small and heavily wooded; 808 is a large lot that is completely denuded of any trees except at its very periphery. It's a yellow-brick building, and we spent a good ten minutes trying to figure out what it might have been.  All the doors are chained shut, and all the windows are covered in chain link. Posted all around are ""No Trespassing"" signs, which ordinarily wouldn't have been enough to keep me from at least going up to peek into the windows. But as soon as my foot crossed over the boundary of the lot, my heart shot a lemur, and I pulled back. There was something that just felt not-right about the place. We conducted a strategic withdrawal (read: tried very hard not to run away screaming) and thought nothing more of it.

Two nights hence, John, was wonderfully spooky, built a great atmosphere, and was a veritable font of knowledge. It's just that none of the sites were all that scary.  He concluded the night with the story of Robert the Doll, reluctantly sharing the details of something that very clearly disturbed him. As the tour broke up, he offered to take us to one of his favorite watering holes.  We would buy him alcohol, but that would still pass the time.

Most of the tour went off to Duval St for liquid refreshment, while my wife and I talked to the wife. John joined us for the last half-hour, and then the other couple headed off for marital bliss and a wicked hangover the next morning. We'd struck up a quick friendship with John, and he invited us to join him at his favorite bar, where he would show us what the locals drank (it wasn't something fruity and rum-based. It was Jack and cokes for... Let's just say John and I drank for another two hours, never saw the bottom of a cup, and the tab was less than twenty bucks.) The conversation wandered hither and yon, I finally remembered the yellow building.

The following
Me: So
John: Go ahead.
M: We headed away from the cemetery
J: yellow
M: That's the one!
J: Not going to talk about it. Move on.

1346323027.0,z2kqm,So I just found out that this subreddit existed so I thought that I would share my story,BlondeJesus,54,8,9,"So when i was pretty young my parents purchased a rental house on a small island next to Saint Augustine, asked me in a very frightened sounding voice if my bed was shaking and if I could hear all the scary noises outside of our room.  The next morning we were both convinced that the house was haunted and we told our parents but they just said that it was just the wind.

Nothing really happened at the house until a couple of years later.  Some friends of me and my brother were visiting the house with my family.  Towards the beginning of the trip they told us to go outside and check out this thing they found behind the house.  Sitting in the sand there was a huge old rusty chain

After this my family decided to do a bit of research to see if there was anything that could have happened where the house is.  We found out that one time when Saint Augustine was still under Spanish control the French tried to attack the city.  However, and then shot them.  The island that my house is on is technically a sand spit (currents push sand onto the shores so it slowly grows over time) which means that my house would have been directly on the beach during the time the French prisoners were shot.

After finding this out one of my Uncles was staying at the house.  After his first night staying at the house he was talking to me mom and told her that while he was laying in his bed he heard the sound of gunshots outside the house.  However

This happened to me in 2010 at my parent's house in South Dakota

I was heading to bed

It was around 12 am, reaching and pulling the string switch for the light and crawled into bed. Only a few parts of my room were lit up from the modem, glowing orange, and my alarm clock, glowing blue. 

I heard the heater kick on and soon felt the warm air filling my room, even if it wasn't that cold outside.

As I was getting comfy, for I was rather warm thanks to the heater. But the cooler air moved up one of my legs. I didn't think anything of it and soon fell asleep.

I woke up not much later
And there she was.

She had a very young looking face for a apparition, the rest of her body was a cloudy like mist. She was entirely gray in color. And then I noticed something. She was smiling. 

Her and I stared at each other for what felt like hours

She didn't respond, got out of my bed and grabbed the string switch to the light and clicked it on. She was gone. My heart was pounding. Was I scared? I tried turning off the light again to see if she would re-appear. She didn't. I turned the light back on, and went back to bed.

I awoke the next morning, I noticed on my mirror it had fogged up. But that wasn't the odd thing. On it, wiped away from the fog with lady like fingers, was a name.

The experience was a dream



I was on the couch



The back is tall



The sudden urgency to look around struck me, I sit up and do a quick head turn, satisfying my anxiety but expecting to not see anything.



But it was standing across the kitchen.



Small in stature, but it was smooth like those fish people from the Legend of Zelda (but more gray), so it shouldn't be described as ""nude""; but everytime I recount this I say ""nude"" because I felt...perverted looking at it. Like it was naked.



Hard to describe



Large eyes but exaggerated almond shape and slanted. Think, and it stood with its arms hanging at the sides, but they hung low, at least to the knees.



It stared right at me and I was frozen with fear for only a moment before I screamed and jumped off the couch to flee; which is where I bolt awake and sit up quickly to make sure the thing isn't standing across the kitchen looking at me.



It's not there and I sleep the rest of the night with the lights on.



The next morning, and admits to having bad dreams as well. We don't disclose the dreams.



Next evening, I never remember falling asleep, it's as if I'm just watching TV and starting to doze when I glance around during an infomercial to see it staring at me. And then I wake up in terror. But every detail is exact, which is abnormal for my usual dreams of being lost or trying to get to the mall to get a pony for my brother.



Lights go on and the next morning my step mother again asks if I'm alright. I explain The dream and how peculiar it is to me to



During my explanation I see her face get concerned, hun.""



She glances over to the spot where I saw the thing in my dream and says: ""I dream about it too



I'm shocked. I've always been a believer in the paranormal



She describes her dream as her getting up to check on my siblings across the walkway that looks into our kitchen. As she glances down to check on me she sees it standing into kitchen



I don't know why I still think this way



""It's here because of Debbie.""



My step mom isn't dumb



Instead



That day we burned sage around my Aunt's belongings. My grandmother had used it ""to cleanse"" the location of the suicide and had left it to us. Never had the dream again



This may just come off as dumb or weird and not paranormal. I don't know how to logically conclude my jump from that thing in the kitchen to my Aunt's belongings being in the house



I guess I feel there was negative energy surrounding them as all were incredibly personal to her during those dark months. But the vivid dream and the real terror were so intense

I post on here because I had this understanding that people liked most things paranormal and/or things that can't be explained. I don't get how you can say ""WASNT IN A LAB SETTING NOT TRUE"" as if anything paranormal has ever been in a lab setting.

The whole logical fallacy of ""well if it can be faked then there's no way it's real"" is beyond comprehension. Sure most things can be faked but it doesn't mean that they were faked. I don't understand the people who even go on this subreddit if all you do is go from post to post screaming ""FAAAAKKEEEE

1368674727.0,1efh2t,I feel like I'm going insane. . .Am I?,FionaaTheHuman,60,20,49,"For about 13 years I've been dealing with things that I have no clue how to explain.

When I was about 5 my family moved into a house in Pennsylvania. Nobody had ever lived in the house before us, my mother began to witness the odd things going on in that house. Pictures of my deceased grandfather would be face down, and my mother would fix them, only to find them face down again. We would hear footsteps in the attic, and I would hear a male's voice from time to time. In that house I never felt safe, or even alone. The feeling of being watched went with me anywhere I went. During the day, the only thing odd about that house was the creepy feeling, someone was banging on the front door in the middle of the night, being in a place with no activity was nice. Then we had to move back to Pennsylvania. 

The new house was nice and everything was fine for months. Eventually we went by the old house that was only about 40 minutes away. After that trip I had an odd nightmare where I asked my mom if whatever was in that house could follow us home, I thought I went completely insane. 

In the dream the thing that had been haunting me preyed on my biggest fear, which was odd since there was probably at least 6 inches of snow on the ground at the time. Before I even caught a glimpse of the car, for some reason I knew it was familiar and I was consumed by dread. As the car went past, I confirmed that it was the same exact car from the dream. It went past me, slammed on the back, and back up. I couldn't look in the car because I knew it was whatever was 'haunting' me. After asking me a question, they drove up to the neighbor's house, walked up, and sped off. The worst part was the neighbors weren't even home. . .how could they order a pizza? After running into the garage, which I left in the middle of the garage

After that night, again, everything was relatively normal, but at night the activity picked up. Pieces of my nightmares would come true the next day, which freaked me out to say the least. At one point when I was in the shower, I heard someone knock on the door, then I heard the door open, and someone walked in. I knew if I moved the curtain someone would be standing there, she said I was just imagining things. Later on, probably not a good idea

Now, everything was normal. I was happy like I used to be, but again, the activity occurred again. Any sort of happiness I had seemed to just vanish. I became the angry person I used to be as soon as the activity began again. Everyone noticed the change but chose not to say anything. At this point I almost knew I was going crazy. I would hear the door slam and footsteps down the hall like usual. This time I was awoken at about 3 in the morning to a clicking noise. I couldn't figure out what it was until I looked at the door and saw the knob turning slightly. Now thoroughly freaked out, I couldn't get back to sleep. At night, I'll hear odd things, and the nightmares have come back. I'll hear voices calling my name and saying things I can't understand. Once I heard a scratching at my door, I opened the door, and the next day the door to the garage kept swinging open. We tried to debunk it over and over again, even with the vanity outside. 

Not only do I deal with the activity in the houses

I have absolutely no clue what to do. . .Am I just going crazy? Or is there something really there that wants my attention? Help would really be appreciated if there's any to be given. ",self,t5_2qjxn,False,f,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1efh2t/i_feel_like_im_going_insane_am_i/

Their house was obviously haunted. As they grew up in the house (they would hear doors opening and closing, the house came alive with paranormal activity again.

This is a little long

I was doing Ouija with my friend

Again

My friend and I were confused so we looked up the number they kept giving us for the year

We focused our thoughts on getting some of those children again, they said yes. They even gave us a name (a name by which I can't remember sadly. Wish I could.). They told us she had died in a fire a few years ago.

So then we focused on contacting her, it pointed to the moon. We started asking about the murders, asked if she regretted it, she said no, asked how many she killed, it was a huge number although I can't remember it, we asked if she had help and she said ""husband"", she spelled ""rape"". Asked if she ever got caught

We ended that session properly

The only thing bad that happened from that was that for about a week after I couldn't even walk into my room. As soon as you walked into my room is was such a heavy feeling, I asked him if he wanted out and he said yes, I asked him if he was angry and he said no. So I went out and bought some saige, did a cleansing, contacted him again and he said he was out and we closed it properly and then everything was fine! 


Now a REALLY cool story that still makes me smile to this day.
It was the second time my friend and I did Ouija, if we said a joke he would even spell out ""lol"" or he would say ""jk"". He talked like a teenager. Eventually my curtains we were sitting by started moving. I asked if that was him. He said ""Yes"" and said he was in the room. I know it wasnt a spirit toying, it was such a comforting feeling and it was full of happiness. We sat for a while, just feeling him around us. My friend starred at me and said ""Your hair just moved against your face liek someone was petting you."" I didn't feel it, but I was smiling so big and asked if he did that, he said yes. I asked him to do it again. All of the sudden I felt like I was being embraced, and at that time he speleld out ""hug"" . My God it was great.

Before we ended the session we asked him if he had any more questions for us; he spelled ""lillibeth... single"" I laughed and told him that sadly

For the next two weeks I felt so comfortable in my house. I was sleeping incredibly well and I could just feel goodness in the home. I contacted him again

I tried several times after that to contact him again

1336212336.0,t86ze,My strange encounter with an old woman with pitch black eyes,DjMonkeydo,54,10,22,"I was reminded of this the other day

Bit of scene setting. In 96/97 I lived in a fairly old terraced house with a cemetary at the end of the road - cliche I know but it's an important detail - nothing remarkable about the house or the area it was just convenient for college.

Anyway I was up late one night on the PC in my bedroom which looked out onto the street. Was about 2 or 3 am. For whatever reason

I could see that they were quite old and appeared to be dressed in funeral clothes which given the hour was weird. There were 2 women and a man

Just outside the front of the house was a street lamp

This was when things got weird - the grin became a sort of grimace and if there was any colour in her face to start with it was now dead white. At that point I realised I was staring right into her eyes

I was suddenly hit with this intense feeling of dread and panic so I threw myself on the floor. As soon as I'd broken her gaze I felt pretty stupid that this upset old woman who clearly needed help had spooked me so badly so I looked out the window again and there was no sign of them. It was a longish straight road and the house was towards the middle so Linford Christie would have had trouble getting out of sight in the time I looked away let alone 3 octagenarians.

So reddit - any ideas what this was all about? Tired mind playing tricks? It felt far too real for that and all these years later I can still remember every detail incredibly clearly and I can recall a good amount of the dread I felt staring into those eyes - I get chills just retelling the story.

I believe in the paranormal but Ouija Boards have always been something I've been on the fence about. I know that a lot of what I'm about to say is going to emit a lot of ""you shouldn't have fucking done that, dumbass"" responses and I accept that I handled the situation poorly. So that said

Last night me and two friends were using his Ouija Board when we contacted a particularly fucked up ""spirit."" Two of us were high and we were all drunk and yes I realize this is where the first problem enlies. Long story short, but wouldn't say what. He said he intended to hurt all of us. We asked him why he hated us,  he said ""Lust."" We asked what we lusted for, he said ""Me."" He did a Figure 8 (I later read this is not something you want a spirit to do), landed on the 6, and started saying other random things but REALLY didn't want us to leave. We finally left, and in our stupidity

so here's where it gets really weird: First off, then looks to see that he has no missed call. I look at the couch and my phone has dialed the number 0 and is calling it. Shortly after, the stereo turns on without any of us even remotely near it. We decide to go to our friends house.

So here's what it gets REALLY weird. We get back at around 3 am. My friend had lost his keys and lives in a decent part of town so he didn't lock his door, but we had multiple laptops, a PS3, and a TV, none of which was taken. Nothing was removed, just moved. 

At this point ""it"" hasn't done anything else. We all made it through the night without anything weird happening. So

So we took the game home, because he is dead against anything like that. 
We went to my daughter's room and started to play. Nothing happened
That night when we were getting ready for bed my daughter asked if I could sleep with her I laughed and said
Laying down next to my husband, no thanks I'll stay here with my daughter. Just like that he went back to bed no more screaming just silence. Now, I started freaking out I started quietly praying. I am not a religious person, but I guess when you are scared enough God starts looking pretty awesome. The  the uneasy feeling subsided and we were able to sleep for that night. The following night it was the same thing same screaming from my husband ""YOU BELONG TO ME"" and the uneasy feeling of being watched. My daughter and I started to pray together. That's when I decided to throw the game out. While walking to the dumpster a neighbor of ours saw what we were throwing out and asked for it. I gave it to him and told him to be careful with it. He laughed at me told me it was just a game.

 Well I was 14 with my 2 older sisters (ones 16 and the other is 18) on a quad bike (as some people call them basically a off road 4 wheeler ) and we were going to my grandparents, i tell them I know where the fence was recently broken so we should use this way (me being a lazy kid not wanting to open anything) it's going though the same feild but entering through another feild from the right side, this is where it starts getting strange fast.. we were going though the feild, almost in our main feild when we see a figure sitting on the pile of rocks, ( let me remind you the pile of rocks is right in the middle of this feild, and this feild is not even a km long, ( I can provide google map images with a drawn diagram if anyone wants, we think it's our uncle sitting with the horses but this thing is sitting strange, this thing is sitting exactly like the devil, once I see these arms I know this isn't normal.. I freak out and tell them to stop
Thinking goddammit this thing can hear us now .. So since we werent far from home we lose sight of this at the first corner and almost hit our deck trying to park close to our house.. And that's it, I'm not lying, I have no reason too.. but this thing freaked us out, a lot. We were so covered in fear that when we went home and told my family my cousin who was the same age as me started crying..  I'm native, I live on a reserve in Canada an we own a lot of land where this happened, so nobody but us travel those trails, we know it wasn't our uncle because we warned everyone. Even before, when I would hear stories about the spirites and bad spirites  I would never believe them..

**TL;DR**- working late, looked scary, and it hissed at me. I dont know what it was.

_____________________________________________________

It happened June 2, and we walked though the basement to the other side of the hospital toward the cafe.

On the way, and Randal.. I am still not quite certain what Randal did.) Anyway, As we are walking though the basement, I pass Vinny and give him a nod, and as we turn the corner toward the stairwell, I notice a slight... humming/buzzy sound? 

The best way for me to describe it is, you know what it sounds like for someone to be vacuuming upstairs. Its muted, but you can hear the tone change as they move from different areas of the room.  

I've never encountered this sound before in the basement

When we were on our way back, but.. we couldn't pin point exactly what direction it was coming from. And that's when I noticed a dark vaporous apparition , it wasn't shaped like a human, more like an oval-ish cloud with what could be a head on top. It was at the end of the hallway, near the stairs we had just come down. It was outside the stairwell door, looking down toward us. 

I have never seen anything like it before

We quickly rushed down the hall, we just sorta looked at each other, and agreed that it just felt weird... in the hallway. Almost like being watched from a dark room, where you cant see in, but you just know something is looking out at you.

A few hours later, heard the same sound, but I didn't see anything. On my back though... It was standing in the hall. Blocking the whole hall, like a huge thick cloud. The junction is a like a  T, the top of the T being the hall I was going through and the intersecting bottom part goes toward another part of the basement and the stairwell opens into the intersecting hall. 

I didn't know what else to do, and aggressively make my way toward it. I was no less than 3 feet away, and it started to ... fade? or evaporate?  to one side of the hall, and I heard it growl and hiss at me as I passed. And once I was passed the intersection, that weird sound stopped. 

Now ive worked since then, but it was nothing like the night we heard it. 

Ive asked Vinny about it


Im not sure what it could be

When I was very young my parents used to take my sister and me down to the very southern tip of the NJ shore.  We would stay in motels/hotels on the beach and take a week away from life and enjoy the shore.  This one year we stayed in a hotel that we have stayed at before.  I was about 4 and my sister was 6 at the time.  The room was a long rectangle.  Entryway, bathroom, and then a large back bedroom with beds.  

The first day we arrived, to our surprise, our front room seemed ransacked.  I remember my father going downstairs to the manager and asking what the hell happened.  The manager came up and said he was working the night shift and no one else was working.  My father mentioned he seemed quite sincere.  We have also stayed at that hotel before and had never had any issues.  My father told him that if it were to happen again that he would be calling the police and filing a complaint.  My father said the manager agreed with him and seemed just as concerned himself about the situation.

When we left for the beach that day

When we came back from the beach - everything was fine in the room.  It was just as we had left it and the maid came while we were at the hotel pool right outside of our door.

The day went along normally

The next morning our front room was ransacked again.  Chairs were on the sofa, the door was WIDE OPEN.  If someone had a key, they could not have entered because the Latch-Lock.

I remember our family being really confused about the situation.  The only other window was a small window in the back room and that was locked from the inside.

My dad mentioned yesterday that he was

My father went down and explained to the manager what was happening.  They both were baffled and the only other room they had available was too small for us.  So, filled two suit cases with clothes and placed them in front of the door, and put the two chairs in front of the door as well.  My father was certain that is anyone was trying to get in, that he would hear it.

The next morning the chairs and luggage were neatly set aside and the door was

Again

We never got a call back.  Life went on for us. 

I still cannot

Has anyone else had similar things happen?


Edit: Update. I spoke to my mom last night again about the incident.  She said that she and my father were too confused at the moment to think it was something paranormal and they did not think someone was coming in the room.  No one was being harmed and it just seemed like something confusing at the time.

Apparently none of them thought we would believe them,' said a girl walked into her room while she was watching TV and quickly left without saying or doing anything. She kept this to herself. Fast forward a few months, 1 and 2 came back to the apartment with one of my room mates who proceeded to crash on the couch. Upon waking up, 2 found him on the floor and asked why. He said 'there was a girl on the couch after I got up to go to the bathroom, so I just slept on the floor.' Weird, both 1 and 2 were in their own rooms and never sleep on the couch. He described it as feminine, clothed in all black

A year or so passed and 2 was sleeping one night during the school week

More recently the figure has been seen by another friend visiting from out of town while sleeping on an air mattress. She said it was just standing in their kitchen (which is open and appart of the living room), and most disturbing of all happened a few days ago. This visit or whatever is the reason for us writing this story.

So one of 2's friend from back home stayed in her room for the night and hung around in the morning while she was off running errands. He woke up around 10am with a 'different girl in the bed' and texted 2 about it. She asked what she was wearing, not seeing her at all. They should have crossed paths, but nope.

My parents didn't really care if I went over the footage to be honest. They didn't feel anything, was pretty funny. The host mentioned was some batty psychic, talking about her pet possessed dolls or something like that. At one point my parents are in another room, next to the room with this lady. My mom was muttering about what a stupid hag she was, when the host apparently heard her the room over, *and started asking the spirits why they were saying such mean things about her*. 



At that point, utilitarian mess hall. I'm not sure what the rooms were, but that's what they appeared to be. 



[This clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Syj4nOKa-yU) is the only interesting thing on their camera or voice recorder. Specifically, this looked like a small child with glowing 'eyes'.

This happened in about late December

It was Christmas and New Years break and I had decided to spend some time with a friend of mine, I said 'no'- she called at around 1:30 am and my mother is not the type of person to call people so late, even me. She hung up quickly after that with no other explanation and I was a bit worried but she obviously wasn't injured and she can handle herself. About half an hour later my friend's sister called and wanted to talk to me. She proceeded by telling me how my mother, herself, and some of their friends had gone out that night for the span of a couple hours or so but what she had told me about what they found upon returning is the disturbing part. They got back to the house to find that all of the lights of the house where turned on, the door and (after checking everything) no other entrance had shown signs of forced entry, all of the windows where locked- even the upstairs ones.

First some background. I'm from the Midwest and currently 23. Everything started happening to my family when I was around 7 or 8. The house we were living in at the time was built on an old Native American Burial ground or something of the such. My great-grandfather passed away peacefully in the house long before I was born and my grandparents spent 3/4 of their life living in the house before we moved in and they lived beside us. My grandparents

Growing up I had a younger brother by 2 years and an older sister by 5. My brother and I were much closer and spent most of the day playing and wrestling since we were closer in age. We were never the most creative or imaginative kids so when things started happening there was no doubt in our parents believing was going on. When my brother was around 5 or 6 he had a new ""friend"". He would tell our family about his new friend

I told my mom immediately and she called my brother downstairs and asked what ""Him"" looked like. My brother grabbed an encyclopedia that we had and found an old 1800s looking man with a long white beard and very eerie looking and said that he looked like this. My mom a little weirded out told my brother he could no longer play with ""Him"". That night some really weird things happened that has never happened to anyone in our family. When I've talked to my mom much later after this she recalls the event like this, and that someone was sitting on her chest choking her. She said she couldn't make a noise and could see my dad sleeping beside her but couldn't wake him up.

In the months following my brother stopped playing with ""Him"" and my mom had this happen to her a few more times. The last time she said something spoke to her in a mans voice. It told her that this was because she wouldn't let my brother play with him. After that other unexplained things would happen around the house. Watches and batteries came up missing in the middle of the night

My mom finally decided to have my dad's brother come over since he was a Pastor at a fairly large church and ""bless"" the house. We were kept downstairs watching tv the whole time while he went from basement to attic praying. I remember his face after being done

Fast forward about 1 month, then followed my other uncle to the church where he possessed a woman before being sent back to wherever. We never had any more experiences in that house until we moved when I was 12.

I will make a part 2 if anyone is interested.

1365533500.0,1c092u,My experience from a few years back,waffleknight,45,7,7,"Hi everyone

I just wanted to share my own experience with paranormal phenomenon - from around 2010.  I should say that throughout this, and at times scared, of all this.  I still don't quite know what happened during this time.  I was living in an apartment with my brother, his wife, and my nephew.  The way the place was laid out was basically one large living room/dining room/kitchen, and then a long hall with rooms and one bathroom off of it.  I had, for a while, opposite the entrance to the hall

The first experience was when I was home sick from work, and saw a shadowy figure move across the door way into the room.  I only got the barest of glances, I 'caught' it just as the torso moved past the door, and the leg as it moved forward.  To say 'shadow' is perhaps a bit incorrect, I saw it as more like moving, thick, gray dust, but brushed it off

It happened again, and rounding the corner of my desk, when I glanced over at my bedroom.  This time, I saw the figure appearing to be standing next to a tall plant on the back wall of my room, opposite the doorway.  Like the first time, it was a tall figure, maybe 6-foot plus, and of course

I told my brother about it, too little sleep.  

Around this time, in a chair adjacent to the bed, hoping to not have anymore problems, if perhaps these sightings were just a trick of the light, or my own momentary 'hallucination', etc.  

I started to have terrible insomnia immediately afterwards.  I couldn't get to sleep until 2 or 3am, out of the little fan unit.  We're on the top floor of the complex.  As I look up, dust starts falling down on my face, out of the fan.  Probably about a small handful of the stuff.  

Things then just started getting stranger.  I didn't like being alone in the house, and sleep during the day.  One night, I was trying to head to sleep a little early, and woke up around 4am.  I looked over into the corner, where the tall plant is, and saw an intensely bright light.  It wasn't like light coming from a car through the window, or from something in the room, I know I didn't get out of bed to check on it

Later in the week, when I heard a very faint 'tap' sound.  Incredibly faint, and I have pretty good hearing.  I looked over, and saw a dead fly on the bed.  And then another fell, and then another, and then another.  All dead, all in the same spot.  

Another time, like a cat.  I actually had a gray cat then, but I looked over at him, thinking it was him running off, and he was laying on the dresser, sound asleep.  

I fell asleep one night, and I'm not sure here if this was on the TV itself, or just something I was 'seeing', but in red letters, I saw 'Your fucking soul will burn'.  I think it was perhaps a dream, I remember being startled and lunging out of bed, but it was maybe the most intense moment of the whole experience.

Not long after that, she opted for the couch.  Now, to add some context for this, my mom is a little odd, and always talks about seeing ghosts and spirits and whatnot.  But as I was walking out of my bedroom to get something for her, the door slammed shut.  The house was closed up for the AC, so there shouldn't have been any wind causing it.  I honestly didn't focus much on this at first, and my mother (again

After a couple more 'gray dust man' sightings, I couldn't be there for it - though they set up late in the night, I was in crunch time at work and didn't get home until 4am.  My brother told me they basically did the usual stuff you'd expect - walked around the house, had an EMF antenna, etc.  Nothing strange happened for them, but they did give me one HUGE piece of information.

I've always been the type who doesn't care how hot or cold it is, or at my chair in the bedroom, or at my desk at work, I had one of those little black Vornado fans blowing on me constantly.  I don't know about the one at work, but the one at home was, according to them, putting out a 1000 or so mG field practically right next to my head.  

From what I had read afterwards, insomnia, and so on.  And after months of exposure like that?  Who knows.  I stopped using the fan, and just like that, these things all stopped.

I moved across the country not long after that

OK, had some pretty bad emotional issues.  She had a hard time expressing certain emotions, would often throw things when she became angry, and screamed at the top of her lungs at me over nothing.  (We soon split when this became a daily occurrence because I couldn't stand the mental abuse.)

Before I continue I need to explain how to house was set up.  When you walked into the entrance you stepped into a vestibule.  The vestibule had two doors.  One door led to an unfinished basement with a washer/dryer/storage and the other door was the entrance to the house.  When you walked into the house you were in a dining room, an entrance to a hallway to the living room and second bedroom and then a first entrance to the main bedroom.

One night she was yelling at me about how I was working too many hours in the dining room.  Out of nowhere we hear

I went out to the vestibule and slowly opening up the basement door and flipped the switch.  The banging stopped when I opened the door.  I slowly crept down the first flight and braced myself when I turned the corner.  I didn't know what to expect

Nothing.  No one was there.  I checked every inch of the basement with Jen standing on the stairs.  I told her it was empty and to stand where we were before.  With a broom

I went back upstairs and turned off the light and listened before entering the house.  You could hear a pin drop.

I close the basement door and then close the main door behind me.  This door had a rather large window frame and a long shade covering most of it except the lower portion. 

We basically stared at each other puzzled.  I am a man of science and logical explanations.  About five minutes later

SLAM SLAM SLAM.  The basement door was slamming.  Again

We both jump to the floor and stare out the lower window.  Sure enough

I stood up to open the door and I could still hear the slamming.  When I opened the main door

I could not explain it.  It was not windy that night and it never happened again.

I have a hard time explaining what I saw and felt that night.  I did not feel scared.  I felt like I was witnessing something unbelievable.

As we are driving, shadow figure, two of them had guilty/worried looks on their faces. The two housemates told my team member that they had come across a summoning spell for a Djinn in the ancient books section of the library of the college and they basically were just trying to conjure a genie to say hello to everyone in the house. For some reason the djinn only went to my team members room and was pretty pissed off. 

My team member says that he thinks what they conjured was an Ifrit/Ifritti (there are tons of ways to spell Djinn names) and I've exhausted all of my search engine hits on Djinn and the different types and lore behind them. I literally just searched Google for the rest of the car ride until we got to the place that we were investigating and I came up with some information

A few years later, we were bored at Cynthia's and had no idea what to do. We lived in a small town and there weren't many places for young people to hang out. The bowling alley was closed, we weren't interested in hanging out at the skatepark, and the movie theatre played films that had been released over six months ago. 

Cynthia asked me if I had ever played Ouija before. I answered that I had never played before, looked at each other and smiled. ""We're gonna have to chance that,"" said Cynthia. I was excited! The girls told me they had played before and it worked. Cynthia's parents overheard our conversation and stepped in the room. ""You know how to do this honey?"" Cynthia's mom asked. The girls said they had played plenty of times on their own, and knew what to do.

We didn't have the typical Ouija board, ""Yes"", ""No"", and ""Goodbye"" on paper. Then, we cut them all up individually to make a circle out of them. ""You're not playing that game in my house though,"" Guylaine warned us. She said we would be playing in the apartment upstairs. Before we left, Guylaine asked me to pick a letter without looking. The letters were all upside down, smiled

Cynthia, ""No"", and ""Goodbye"" in the middle. We didn't have a pointer, so we used a glass (upside-down) instead. We lit two candles and turned off the lights.

As excited as I was

Before we tried to play again, and not to leave the room until we're certain the entity is gone. I smiled and nodded. 

We were now five people at the table, causing it to move. 

Then, but it was locked into place. 

It started spinning in circles, and that everyone was wrong to tell me that I had a hyperactive imagination. I was happy.

The glass started doing figure 8s on the table. If I had a cellphone back then

When the glass slowed down, Amina. Two summers before, Amina passed away at my parents' cottage. She was 7 years old. I changed a lot after her death. I was depressed and was also diagnosed with Anti-Social Anxiety Disorder. I blamed myself for Amina's death and felt like my family may have blamed me too. Long story short, we were walking on the beach with my dad. He told us that the area was dangerous and that we should head home. I followed my dad, but heard Amina yell my name. I turned around and she was in the water. I ran towards her, extended my arm to get her out of there but she pulled me in with her. The current was so strong that even my dad couldn't get us both out of the river. I was finally able to reach the shore, but by the time I could find someone to help us

I don't remember if I asked for Amina myself, but I was scared because there were many questions I wanted to ask her. I was scared of her answers. Before I could ask any questions, however, I decided to test the spirit. I asked basic questions, such as ""What is my name?"" and ""How old are you?"" I wonder if she would still answer 7 if I asked her the same question today (she would be 21).

I finally asked her the question I feared the most. ""Did I do this to you?"" I asked. There was no answer. I looked at everyone. I was shaking. I was trying so hard not to cry. ""Was it my fault?"" I asked. The glass slowly slid towards ""No"". I was relieve. Sylvain asked me if I wanted to ask her more questions. I said I didn't know. He started asking her if was in Heaven and questions like that. The glass always pointed towards yes. For some reason, slammed both hands on the table and yelled, ""NO SHE DIED ON THE 9TH OF JULY!""

The glass quickly went to 9.

I slowly sat down. I was angry. I was so frustrated I wanted to cry. I told Sylvain, looking at the glass move from one answer to another. At one point, Sylvain and Guylaine thought they were speaking with Guylaine's father. They even asked ""him"" to break the circle. The glass would point to ""No"", but it finally did. Sylvain firmly held the glass (still on the table). He had difficulty keeping it on the table, and finally pushed it back in the circle.

We finally went back downstairs. Cynthia's parents were sobbing and not really talking to us. The girls asked me if I was okay. I wasn't. I couldn't understand what had happened. If, it left me with all sorts of questions. Did I really talk to my niece? Was I fooled by a spirit (who could obviously read my mind)?

For my real issue

The first spirit that I want to let you know about is just a pesky guy that I called Till. Till seems centered on one room of the house, I awoke to him shaking the bed vigorously, even though it did not seem to move. I never saw Till, only felt and experienced him. Since I moved out of that room, Till seems to have gone.
The second entity we (my brother, then glances into the living room at the end of the hall before vanishing. This happens at least once a month and that's all he does. He seems to just check on things.

Two of them are children. I remember playing with them as a child and recall their names are Billy and Amy. I don't know why they're there, you hear my keys hit the floor followed by a little girl's laugh. My keys were on the floor when I came back down.

Here lies my problem:

The fifth and final entity we call ""The Wraith"", my brother and I started seeing it when we were both young and before the movies came out. It inhabited in a side room of the basement that holds a tanning booth, weight set and a freezer. The weights and tanning booth are almost never used and the freezer is near the sliding glass door that gives access to the room. The glass of the door is clouded and sometimes you can see it glare out through the glass. This room has no lights and there is nothing to cast a reflection. Even being near this room will send chills down people's spines, and no one wants to be down there alone. Now, when I was a kid, my cousin closed me in there and I remember freaking out but not why.
That thing has been in there for at least twenty two years... until a month or so ago.

For the past three nights, but it tells me that the house is going to burn or I am going to burn or SOMETHING is going to burn. It wakes me up in a cold sweat, this dream, and when I wake I swear I hear a voice in my ears. But I feel like the Wraith is there, and it hasn't been in it's room for at least a month. Any advice is welcomed.

EDIT: Tossed and turned last night. Felt like there was something watching me all night. Tried not to get any REM sleep, but it spent a good chunk of the night harassing me. It mocked and demoralized me. It was gone by the time the sun came up, and only then did I get some peace, but that didn't last long as I had to rise for the day.

So I'm laying in bed, maybe if I pray to the goddess (I was Wiccan), I'll have some protection. As I was praying, I felt like I was getting short of breath. Soon, it felt like there was a hand around my throat, choking me.

I was able to say my roommates name loud enough for him to wake up and as soon as he remembered where he was, saying 'Leave her alone! Come after me!' And ran out of the house. 

Shortly after, I don't know how he got rid of it but I was never bothered by it again. Can't say for certain for my friend though.",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,1358007043.0,,

The second building has 6 floors and the hallways are also outdoors with railings. There weren't many stories such as murders and all of that in the first building but the second building gets stops on the tourist ghost tours to talk about how fucking haunted it is.

I'll go from the least creepy to the creepiest. (You know to build suspense and such.)

#1: The Sophomore Year Dorm Hooker Heels and Marbles Story:

This story is from my most recent quarter at school. I live in the 6 floor building I mentioned above. I live on the 6th floor and my girlfriend lives on the 5th floor right under me and two doors down. The 6th floor is supposedly the most haunted floor in the building because of one story about room 634. When the dorms were a hotel back in the day a hooker and her young son stayed there. They couldn't afford to live there so the drunken landlord would take sex as payment. She would always send the kid off somewhere so he wouldn't see. The son thought it was a sort of hide and seek game, and he killed her. The son would hide in different places every time so this last time he went to the roof of the building. But as a little kid wouldn't know, the roof doors lock behind them. The kid died on the roof. The story is that you can hear marbles on your ceiling every once in awhile and you can also hear the hooker's heels in the hallways behind you or on the ceiling if you're on the 5th floor and down. About the time of the end of the quarter I was in my girlfriend's room before class at about 11am. Her neighbors upstairs who are two doors down from me always make a ton of noise so we usually didn't think anything of it but we heard the distinct sound of heels walking around. We joked about it and let it go. Later that day I saw the kid outside of his room and thought I'd ask him just to see what happened. He said no one in his room was wearing heels at all that day. I also hear heels all the time when I'm in my bathroom that sounds like they're from the hall but my roommate who's closer to the hallway didn't hear anything. i also hear marbles all the time on my ceiling.

#2: The Freshman Year Dorm Room Netflix Disaster:

Around the end of second quarter of our freshman year, clicking them, and then going back to the menu to do it all over again with different movies and shows. 

#3: The Freshman Year Dorm Room Chair Story:

It was around midterms and my roommate and I were up late working on projects till about 2 or 3 am. At this point in the year we were still new to the whole dorm life and we were trying to keep the room as neat as possible, and go to sleep. We heard footsteps outside our hallway but only by our door going back and forth. No shadows were going past our blinds which was a little weird. We shrugged it off and went to sleep only to wake up in the morning with my roommates desk chair in the middle of the room facing his bed.

#4: The Sophomore Year Phantom Car Story:

During the last week of school of my latest quarter, where there is a driveway/parking lot type thing for people to pull up and pick people up or drop them off. There was absolutely no one outside and no cars on the road, obviously because it was 2am on Wednesday. The only thing we saw was a black honda probably from like 2000 pull up to the door right as we walked outside. We didn't think anything of it because it was just a car, we assumed it was someone's ride. We were out there for probably 10 minutes at the most and didn't notice anyone get out of the car or anyone get in the car from the building. Keep in mind it pulled up to the door right as we walked outside. We still didn't think much of it as we were walking inside. I go inside first and hit the elevator button as my roommate is standing in awe in the doorway. I was confused and all he said was get over here. I walked over and he said there's no one in this car. I looked in through the only semi tinted windows and saw the whole driver seat and steering wheel and all of the other empty seats in the car and then it drove off.

Last night

Now on one side of my yard there's a huge tree (maybe it's oak? I don't exactly) that's probably a hundred years old or more with large branches that reach all across the yard and about half of my roof.

So I look up where the dog is looking and realize he's looking into the trees branches. The porch light is on at this point and illuminates a bit of the tree. My eyes immediately go to a certain spot high up and close to the trees trunk. There I can kind of see something. I'm not really sure what I'm looking at at first but I begin to feel really weird. There's this odd tingling sensation going all through my body and I begin shaking. The idea pops into my head that I should look away but I can't. As I stare more

I felt so weird like my body realized what I was seeing before I could. I've never felt that way in my entire life. I spent the entire night pulling all the blinds over all the windows in my house and locking everything. I didn't sleep I was so scared. I still haven't slept.

The alien looked like a grey alien. I know it sounds insane but it did. It was more beige than grey and had these huge almond-shaped black eyes. It was staring at me. We stared at each other for a few seconds but it felt like a lot longer. I know that the grey aliens aren't supposed to blink (I read about it) but this one did.

I had a panic attack at soon as I got inside and I freaked the eff out.

Please somebody tell me I'm not crazy. I need to know if what I saw was real and what's it doing here? What was it doing in my yard out of all the yards possiible?

I don't live in rural America nor do I live in a small town. I live in one of the biggest cities in the world (Los Angeles) and I know I wasn't imagining it. Is it going to keep bothering me? Please somebody help me.

It was a normal night nothing special or out of the ordinary about it. My friend and I were heading home from the movies and everything was good. Now my driveway is about a quarter mile long with 2 houses on the right side of the driveway and Forest on the left. So we turn into my drive way and my friend being the wise guy looked over to me and said

Apon turning the lights back on about 20ft in front of us was a man, or dangerous or ANYTHING! So he stands in his yard and start asking this guy if he was okay. So my friend gets impatient and puts the truck in drive and starts to in forward. As soon as he did this the man in the drive way started to move.

As we sit here and watch this guy get up my friend puts the brakes on again and lays on the horn. Now at this time the guy is having a hard time standing up but once on his feet in our headlights we could see him a little better. He was not normal. He stood at about 6'4 long slender body (Insert Slenderman joke) and unclothed. His arms were long and he had slim fingers. His face was peculiar too in the sense that his jaw was longer then usual and got narrower towards the bottum but not super narrow there was definition to his chin. His nose was small but his nostrals were defined and his eyes were small and close to the nose he didnt have much definition to his lips just the shadow of an upper lip. As to his package.... well there wasnt one not even so much as a buldge. The reason we later deemed him Moss Man was because all over his pale body was little green blotches everywhere like patches almost. 

So as he gets to his feet the figure stands tall and stumbles a little bit before walking towards the car. My neighbor at the time started to walk over and kept telling him he was tresspassing and he knew his rights (He was a Redneck). My neighbor yelled into his house to grab the gun which was about the time we figured we would get the hell out of there. As we are panicing with this strange thing walking towards us my friend slams it into reverse and hauls as out of my driveway and int o the neighbors yard where we hit a tree. 

After this happened it took about a week for me to go back home and to this day I wouldnt be caught outside of my house with out someone with me or something in my hand.

1335079326.0,smeb7,Skeptic to believer in one night. All it took was a doll... (very long post),BezziVelinov,51,13,36,"I never believed in the paranormal as a kid and throughout most of my teen 
years.... until one night that made me a firm believer. I was a normal 16 year old high 
school girl. Made decent grades
stayed out of trouble. I decided to introduce my best friend
school PC games: American McGee's Alice.... a totally morbid and macabre game based 
off the story of Alice in Wonderland. She loved the game almost more than I did. She 
would draw creepy pictures of Alice and the Cheshire cat
almost every time she came over. At this same time
fascinated with the whole ""Wicca"" thing and started practicing it: Dressing in black
wearing pentagrams
about it too much... honestly I didnt care or judge

One day she surprised me at school by pulling a figure out of her messenger bag of 
Alice
as I was a big fan. Actually
figures. I wanted them too! A few weeks had passed and as always
Algebra 2 class to her waiting for me. She looked a bit uneasy and before I could say
 anything she handed me a note. I dont remember exactly what it said
the lines of ""I need to talk to you about something... privately. Not over the phone or in 
public."" Naturally
 nicest guy Id ever met... did he hit her? Omg what if he's doing worse?! All sorts of ""omg 
what if...?"" questions started whizzing around my head and made waiting for lunch almost
 torture. When I met up with her
building at the limits of campus. I proceeded to ask if she was ok... she said she was fine
 but was very scared of going home. I instantly thought her step dad was being an 
asshole again. I hated the guy and was ready to pounce on an opportunity to give him 
what he deserved. She swore up and down that she wasnt making this up and if I didnt 
believe her
Immediately I put on my poker face and listened. She told me about one particular 
practice that she did called ""spirit writing""
inviting your ""spirit guardian"" to control your hand and answer the questions that you 
write. Of course the first thing that popped in my head was ""What the hell.... you scared 
the shit out of me for nothing"". I kept listening though... She told me the names and ages 
of her ""spirit guardians""
amounts of details about them. It seemed that one of them
liked the Alice figure she had shown me a few weeks ago.

Ali's room was about 10x12 with her door in the corner
adjacent to the closet doors just a foot or two away. The bookcase was 
roughly 10 feet from the door and the floor was carpeted
Suzanne ""played"" with this figure everytime Ali would leave the room. Progressively it had 
gotten to the point to where she hadnt even stepped out of her door completely before 
turning to see the doll gone from its perch on the bookcase and at her feet.  ""Ok
lost her goddamn mind"" I thought to myself
straight face. I wanted to believe her
creepy doll moving on its own? Whatever. But
my disbelieving heart to call bullshit. So I told her I would stay with her over the weekend 
if it really scared her that much. I even offered to help her research on how to fix the 
""problem"" So the weekend came and I went home with her from school. As we walked in
her mom was in the kitchen cooking something that smelled amazing. I took Ali's stuff 
from her and carried it to her room as she started talking to her mom in the kitchen. I 
opened the door
off my backpack and put it in front of the closet doors like I always did. I straightened up 
and looked at the Alice doll that adorned the top shelf. I just... stared at it. Almost felt 
like I was making eye contact with it. Slowly I turned and walked away to join Ali and her 
mother in the kitchen.

We were talking and eating for roughly half an hour. None of us had left each 
others sight. Ali and I started talking about our art projects as her mom started washing 
dishes. I wanted to show her what I had done so far on my piece and hopped off the bar 
stool to go to her room. The door was ajar
the Alice doll and its creepy vibe... until I walked in and saw immediately that it was not 
on the shelf anymore. I paused in mid-step
darting all over the floor
 looked under the bed
Could you come here a second?"" She walked in and noticed what was wrong. She did the 
exact same thing I did: spun around looking
shelves
not possible...."" I kneeled down and grabbed a strap. It was almost painful to lift... but 
there it was. Alice was underneath my bag. ""No fucking way.... how the fuck?"" After a 
moment of well... just staring again
My mind ran through all the possibilities it could. ""The wind knocked it over. Someone put 
it there when I wasnt looking. It was there in the first place."" Ok
are closed. Secondly
Thirdly.... well
back on the shelf
had just happened. I couldnt think of an explanation. I shook off my creeped out feelings 
and proceeded to do what I originally intended to do.

A few hours later
and drawing. Her mom popped in to tell us she was going to the store and as soon as she 
left
room. Alice was gone again. But this time
doorway
icecream and jumped back into Ali
once again positioned her on the bookcase. Alright
actually kind of pissed at this point. I wanted to know what the hell was going on. So I 
suggested we perform a few experiments on the bookcase. We bumped it
things at it, knocked the walls, opened doors, 
opened windows
it even budged was when I took my shoulder to the side of the shelf. Even then
not bounce on the carpeted floor. How the fuck was it getting aaaaaaall the way to the 
door and furthermore

The rest of the night
Ali's mom with groceries
Single. Time. Sometimes she would be a few feet away
times shed be almost in the doorway. We spoke nothing of it and just put her back on the 
shelf. I didnt want to think about it anymore
reason. I didnt want to admit that it scared me and I DEFINITELY didnt want to admit 
that it might be a spirit or whatever moving this thing.

Finally
year old girls do
under a big feather comforter... I loved that blanket. I was in the middle of my sentence 
when a rattling sound interrupted me. At first
was coming from the bookcase. I completely froze... and I could feel that Ali had done 
the same. 30 seconds straight of no breathing or moving and the loudest pulse Id ever 
heard in my life pounding in my ears almost deafening me to the rattling on the shelf. Ali 
sprung up and yanked the chain on the fan to turn on the light. She leaped from the bed 
and snatched the doll off the shelf
the lid shut
Alice was returned to the shelf
wasnt allowed to play with Alice anymore. The activity didnt stop there at all. Weird and 
crazy shit continued until almost the end of my junior year
another day. Even now
and how it changed my whole life. Sometimes
and in some way... I hope it does.

I was little I told my mother that I died near a bridge we drove over. I think I was 6 or 7-ish. But I remember telling her about me being shot in the chest and leg, nor had I been there before. But my mom said it was creepy listening to me describe the things I was seeing, and that I was a man in this ""story"" as she called it. I asked her many years later where we were when I told her this. After looking it up, it turns out it was an old battlefield from the Civil War. 


In addition I want to add that sometimes I dream about places before I visit them. Houses/buildings mostly. I will dream about place, but I thought I would share that as well.

During this particular experience, aunt and uncle. Each group had 3 walkie talkies so people could even split off into pairs if they wanted and the whole group could still communicate. The first group began their investigation on the first floor, and we began our's on the third, to give a little buffer so we could stay out of each other's way. We tried EVP sessions, using EMF detectors, grid lights, and a whole bunch of other things that really lead us nowhere. We went up to the fourth floor and tried there for a long time too, some of the group started to get frustrated.

We just sat there for a minute making jokes and trying to lighten the mood for ourselves, and nothing happened still. We decided at this point to go downstairs and meet up with the other group so we radio'ed them and told them we would be coming down shortly.
We packed up our equipment and started walking to the staircase when my dad said ""I firmly believe there are no ghosts at Waverly Hills."" And we all started joking with him that he was going to piss them off, and then it would cut it and sort of bounce between them, one at a time, and then settle back on all three again. He said ""What?"" again and there was more singing. When the song finished, she broke out into Take Me Out to the Ball Game. 

We decided at this point it must be a kid on the same channel we were on since it was open with no encryption, and heard us say to change to channel two, but nobody at all had any idea what we were talking about. Luckily my dad had a voice recorder on and he played it back for everyone.

When I get in my car and turn the headlights on, I can definitely, without a doubt in my mind, see a figure standing outside the cellar. Just a shadowy silhouette, not dark enough for my eyes to play tricks on me like that.


This all happened awhile ago. So yesterday I finally asked my boss why the cellar was located in another building and he responds by explaining how the cellar under the bar was too small and difficult so they moved it in the 1920s to where the mortuary used to be.

I didn't really mind so I said hello, thanked any spirits for their participation and dismissed them, and even though I'm  an agnostic (or so I think, it's complicated for me) I said a quick prayer.

It was at this point that I realized that the board was glow in the dark. I picked it up and went into my closet that's under the stairwell, so yeah I was pretty freaked out.

I tried to debunk it right away by gripping another side of the board and letting go, no matter what. This was when the fingers faded, not all at once but one by one. So it went slowly from three fingers, to two, then one. During this time I was yelling for my friend to come inside and look, but for one I don't think she heard me and I don't think she would have came even if she did, not that I blame her.

So first I'm going to explain a few details, a jumbled journal. One of them being the audio/video, which I'm going to post below this, you can choose to watch it first, or read this first, it's up to you but reading all of this is key to understanding why I chose to investigate this place and a pretty strange occurrence I had there, with a lot of other ""self occurrences"" that happened to me, and my grandma when we lived with her at her previous senior complex. The other links include an Aerial photo of the complex

YouTube Link:

(if you can

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiUV3y2dfs

The EVPs I've found in the audio so far are..

* **""BURNED YOU""** 

* **""NO

* **""LOCAL? HATER""**

I believe the word ""Local"" is said before a pretty obvious ""Hater"" you'll have to decipher yourself but I'm fairly confident that I've interpreted all of the EVPs correctly

The text in the video is pretty much a short version of things I've included in our jumbled journal here. This was the first kind of ""trial EVP investigation"" I've ever done, I really wasn't prepared for what I caught but who is I guess, studying the Paranormal isn't new to me, but investigating it is. My mind is very open, however I always try to find an explanation for everything, and in this case there literally is no other explanation as the place was and is always super quiet, everyone keeps to themselves

I lived in another senior complex where we, so we'll take a look back at the things that happened a few years ago in my grandmas old complex, as they didn't just happen to me. She never really gave an explanation to why she wanted to move out, it was a nice place but I just figured she grew tired of it, and maybe the landlords, but she seemed to never really want to be alone, now it's the opposite from what I can tell at least.

The experiences I encountered there.

One night I fell asleep on the couch watching T.V and I woke up in the bathroom standing up in total darkness, the T.V had been shut off and there was no noise. I had NEVER EVER walked around during my sleep, to this day I wonder what in the world happened for me to do that and just how long I had been standing there.

It didn't just happen to me though, he was standing there up against the dresser.

One night I heard banging on the walls but had no clue where it was coming from, or maybe straight.. it just seemed to be there, as a sound in no particular direction which is very odd for a senior citizen complex as the people are just very quiet in general.

This continued for 2 days straight

Not to long after, but it wasn't really, my eyes were open, I could move but it was like someone was leaning on me with all their weight while I tried to move as slow as possible but slowly went back to the position I had been trying to break, my eyes began to roll into the back of my head and it was just extremely creepy, it freaked me out for days.

My bathroom in the back master always felt like I was being watched when I showered, like a large attic that had a small crack but all you could see was darkness and there was no light source. My dad and grandma were getting sick all the time, dad was hospitalized twice with pneumonia and everyone developed these crazy coughs, my grandma has Emphysema and her cough was the worst ever, now it's barely ever heard. I live in CA by the way, it's never really cold where I live so the pneumonia was pretty odd as we always kept the house warm for my grandma. These were the craziest things that happened, the little stuff is very debatable, stuff missing

I try to ALWAYS use a skeptic side when I encounter things like this, opened up Audacity and hit record, explained to whatever/whoever is there what I was doing, said a quick prayer for some kind of protection just in case, you never know, and that was it, I made it to the 2nd floor on this session and later down in the rec room which I have not reviewed yet.

There was one detail I left out of the video that really made me want to investigate this place more than just what I experienced at my grandmas old complex.

We live not to far from my grandmas

For referencing

I'm a pretty curious guy, not a space, not an apartment uni, there's a picture for reference below. I watched him for a few minutes thinking he would move, he didn't budge an inch, he was locked on to something in the distance. 

Strange but nothing really THAT out of the ordinary, the man looks to be around 6 ft tall, and for a brief 2 seconds if that she disappears. For a very brief moment it seemed like she came to the side of his head, went to hide again like she'd been seen, then completely disappear.

The way she did this was almost sideways, in my head I was like whaaat in the wooorld just happened here... the angle and the way she did it was impossible, she would of had to be around 6 ft. 5 to do this and even if it was someone on a chair, the chairs throughout this place aren't like that, they're all the same, very small and you sink in when you sit on them, very low, then he looked over at me and stared me down for 5 minutes until my dad came out and we left

I know a lot of faces at this place as I'm there a lot to visit and help my grandma, very sensitive. I figured I would hold it and run the USB to my Netbook in my backpack while recording, that way I'll be more mobile and won't look crazy holding a bright screen talking to the air if anyone looks at me weird.

Here is another reference photo of the events that happened, this street view must have been right when it was completed because it doesn't look that nice and the paint and surroundings are darker now.

That's pretty much it for now everyone, the ""BURNED YOU"" EVP really makes me wonder if there was some sort of fire, who knows, I'll post more if anything else in the rest of the audio turns up, so that's where I'm at now, thanks again.


**UPDATE**

8/5/13 

I was just going through the rest of the audio from my walk and it's incredible what else I caught, a name of someone.. like I said below, it's like this place is alive. I will be doing a night investigation there tomorrow with a nicer mic as I'll be staying over and I should have the new video up with the new audio I've found before I leave.

I don't know much of the buildings history

And just down the road from us is a pub that claims it is ""the most haunted building in town""

Whilst working I've seen things out of the corner of my eye on occasion

Onto my story

Yesterday (7/7/13) I was cleaning our bar area at around 4am when from behind me I heard a genderless voice announce ""hello"" which wasn't unusual as we often have guests moving around at all times of the night.

I turned around to offer my greeting to the person
I recoiled in shock

Confused I walked around the area
This confused me more and with this I went upstairs to our front desk and spoke to my colleague Stuart about what I had seen.
He was perplexed about the situation as I was
It also transpired that no guests that we knew of were walking around the hotel at that time.

Today
I've just been cleaning out restaurant area
But tonight I've again heard and seen things I cannot explain.
As I was happily mopping away, similar to that I would hear if someone placed a tray of dirty plates in our pot wash area.

I looked into the kitchen expecting to see my colleague Stuart putting things away
Confused and curious I walked around the area to find the source of noise

I shrugged it off and went back to my mopping
I got back to the mop and carried on cleaning.
It was then I noticed in my peripheral vision a man in a black suit and white shirt

He was stood in such a way that it looked as if he was talking to someone in the empty chair.
I blinked and looked up.

There was no trace of the mystery person.
I looked around the entire area and couldn't see anybody or anything that could have passed me without me seeing them.

This has just happened to me
To say I'm a tiny bit spooked is an understatement.

1362748696.0,19wrcx,The little boy,Alpha-Echo,51,14,18,"I had some strange experiences in a number of different places over the course of a few years

I think it's important to mention that whilst I am not closed to the possibility of paranormal phenomena

Perhaps my experiences can be explained as such, I do not believe in an afterlife, the existence of a soul and any form of conscious intelligence behind 'ghosts'. I do however subscribe to the notion of scientific theory proposing alternate dimensions and the undiscovered possibilities of our own conscious.

'The little boy' is the first encounter I had with the unknown and I will document the others hereafter. I would be interested to hear your opinions or theories about any possible explanation(s).

I was visiting a friend who was temporarily staying with his dad, handsome terraced three story Georgian town-house in a leafy crescent. After an evening meal in the house with the family, my friend and I went to a nearby pub for a few pints and returned before midnight.

I was staying in the spare room in the downstairs part of the house that also contained the master bedroom and my friends room. I fell asleep soon after I got into bed but woke up unusually early as the dawn light started to come through the blinds (it was summer so was quite bright). I don't think it was the light that woke me however for standing in the middle of the room was a small boy who was looking at me and smiling.

He looked around the ages of four or five

I remember this clearly as he was completely solid, mischevious looking wee boy. I sat up in bed and heard myself asking him 'What's in your hands?' I say heard because there was a very strange feeling about it all, it seemed absolutely real to all my senses yet there was a 'thick' feel to the atmosphere that made it almost dream like (I have experienced both lucid dreaming and sleep paralysis and this was definitely different) 

At that point he opened his hands and I seen he was holding a small mouse. He laughed then moved towards me then released it under my bed. I twisted round and looked underneath the bed where I couldn't see the mouse

I felt strange, checked the room and looked out the door:the house was totally silent.

I figure I must have dreamed it, I did not at that point remember the experience I'd had earlier.

His dads gf was dishing up a cooked breakfast as I sat down at the table.As she was putting items from the pan onto our plates her son was talking to my friend and said something about a rat. My mind flashed back  and I said 'hey

At that point the gf froze as she was dishing up. She looked at me completely seriously and said 'Did he have blonde hair, I've seen him as well'

I got a shiver up my spine and felt instantly like what I saw was no dream. It was then that my friend said he'd not seen the boy but often he felt like as he was going to sleep he could feel someone stroking his hair. The teenage son also confirmed he'd heard the boy playing and had also seen an elderly woman in the house. My friends dad hadn't experienced anything at that point (he would later) and was gently mocking us.

I have since met a friend of the gf who seen the boy as well when he was staying there. It seems the house was quite active

I know this was a long message so thanks for reading until the end. If anyone is interested in other events that occurred in the house or would like to see a photo of it

**Plain Old World**

Nothing supernatural here, swamp gas, weather balloons, barn owls, etc.


**Slightly Mysterious**


An eerie howl in the woods, but such appearances are ephemeral and fleeting at best. 


**Magic Is For Real**

A hefty helping of the occult and supernatural. Ghosts exist, voodoo, rituals, mediums, psychics, Wiccan magic, ""energy healing"", remote viewing


**Close Encounters**

That ""weather balloon""? Yeah, aircraft are shadowed and sometimes outright abducted. Major world governments know, and the MIB are keeping things under *very* close wraps. 

**Creature Feature**

Crytpids are very real. Despite their often impressive size

**Monsters Are Out There**

Think *Buffy*, or *Dresden Files*. Not only is magic real, but so are the monsters. *All* the monsters. Bigfoot, werewolves, vampires, Nessie, ghosts, Mothman, but they're mostly in the dark too; it's the supernaturals who are running the show. The paranormal in society operates a lot like it does in the universes mentioned above

**I Want To Believe**

Everything you read about is real. Extraterrestrials, mutants, classified prototypes, curses, cryptids, secret government experiments, global conspiracies, *X-Files*. There's a lot of people who know

So ever since I was little, I saw this beautiful lady walk down the main flight of stairs. After describing her, my father said he had seen the same. You know how children are.. sensitive.. to this kind of stuff? Well my parents told me that when I was two years old, at that same house, I was sitting in my highchair one dinner, and just lifted my plate of food up in front of me, as if I was offering it to someone. Except my parents of course saw no one. And they said that I was staring intently in front of me as if someone was there.

Anyway, I was sitting on a children’s wooden chair in the kitchen, bouncing my baby brother on a [baby bouncer](http://www.google.com.au/imgres?q=baby+bouncer&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=664&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=31XweTI-5N_4zM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.bebeonline.com.au/blog/category/rockers/&amp;docid=WudGHPK6Pk_RDM&amp;imgurl=http://www.bebeonline.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/babybjornsilver.jpg&amp;w=500&amp;h=332&amp;ei=Tn8XUK3HNo6ziQeVtoGIBQ&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=rc&amp;dur=578&amp;sig=102984396251390387791&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=132&amp;tbnw=182&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=22&amp;ved=1t:429,r:19,s:0,i:172&amp;tx=120&amp;ty=67)  . I got up, walked 10m to my mother in the laundry to ask her something, crying, this was 12 years ago also, upside down

So 3 years later, and current, house. I remember seeing shadows and figures CONSTANTLY whilst growing up. At that young age, I freaked out all the time. But now, as an 18 year old, I’m just used to it. Anyway, I remember when I was 9, I looked outside my window at night. I saw these two dark silhouettes, I remember. I felt like they were watching me.. and I felt for some reason that if I swore at them, where you tapped it to turn the light on. One tap

The thing is, eg. taps against it. I tested it myself by trying to tap it on with my hand through my sleeve. Wouldn’t work. And lastly, I had my arm hanging off the edge of the bed one night, and I felt someone hold my hand. I was only half asleep, so I woke up, called for my sister who slept below me to ask why she held my hand, and found that she was fast asleep.

A year or two later, I saw this face pressed up against the inside of one of these clear, yet coloured, storage boxes that was sitting on the side of the corridor, just opposite the room. I remember vividly – easily one of the scariest things ever – this face; it was a female head, somewhat grimacing at me.. like it was laughing at me because it knew I was scared. It looked like it was decaying, with dirty, that image has been burned into my brain. I remember that I was so scared that I actually screamed in fright and refused to sleep in my own bed that night

When I was in Year 6, one night. The curtains were open, and I casually looked outside the window. As I did, I saw this very dark silhouette.. glide.. it seemed like, past the window, very casually.

After that, I would see random figures and shadows around the house, once or twice a year. Then suddenly, last year in year 12, it all changed.

Towards the end of the school year, and decided to go to bed. It was around 10.30 at the time, and I decided to go pee before I went to bed. I went to the toilet, and whilst on it, heard heavy-set footsteps outside. Firstly, take note: Imagine a horizontal line, and divide it into thirds. On the left, which is on the corner of the house; the middle, crunching on the leaves, I listened for a minute. Nothing. So I quickly finished

There is a tall fence surrounded our yard, but didn’t want to scare me.  Since the toilet light was on too whilst I was using it, I’d have thought that someone trespassing would’ve stayed away from that area, instead of being so noisy right next to it. So, after having found no one, and searching all outside, and hearing nothing
Here’s where it starts to get creepy. A few nights after that event, and heard the footsteps on the lawn outside my room, walking around the house. I woke up my father again, we investigated, and found/heard no movement or anyone. From then on, every few weeks, I would hear this same walking outside my room. And then I started to hear the heavy-set footsteps, walk against the cement porch outside my room. Soon, as well as things outside being moved. (we have heaps of boxes, I would hear boxes being hit against/tapped

Then at around April or so this year, lol). When I started seeing these figures regularly, the occurrences from outside had since stopped.

There is an orb of light that randomly appears in our house at night. The last sighting of it was last night and my sister discovered that it cannot be photographed (she showed me the failed attempt). It happens maybe once every few months.

This is a description of it

* It does not move

* It is always on the floor

* It is the size of a softball and it glows brightly

* It is far away from a wall

* It has been upstairs


The cruddy part is that this orb cannot be photographed, it is never storming when one of us has witnessed it. Also, it does not move and there is no smell.

None of us has tried to touch it
Feel free to ask more questions

I am in the first floor of a 3rd floor building.  The 3rd floor is where the executives are and every Wednesday at 7am I have to go upstairs and join them in the 3rd floor conference room for a big meeting.

This particular morning it was just before 7am.  I was the only one in the first floor and walked out of the first floor and was walking towards the elevator (yeah I know

My company had recently let go of a long time employee.  Just a few weeks earlier in fact.  He had been with the company for years

He had been an attendee of that Wednesday meeting for years....

The week after my ""I'll be there"" incident his former boss received a call from that employee's father.  He had been trying to contact the son and hadn't been able and finally called police to go check on him.  When they arrived on that Friday they found him dead in his couch.  

The coroner concluded he had drank himself to death... and estimated the time of death sometime late Tuesday

When I heard that story I suddenly remembered the voice I had heard that Wednesday morning.  And I was able to put 2 and 2 together as to what it could have been.  He was trying to make the meeting!

Holy shit.

Anyways, and I opened my eyes and looked to see what she was growling at. It was dark in my room except for the moonlight shining in from the outside. I saw what appeared to be a black figure, with no face. It was like a mannequin of sorts. Taller than my dresser. I dismissed it and figured I was just seeing things. I layed my head back down. Curiosity got the best of me and I took another peek out of the corner of my eye. It was still there. At this point I sat up in my bed, my dog was still staring at it. I sat there and looked at it, telling myself it wasn't real. It then started walking around the corner of my bed, towards me. I jumped up as fast as I could and turned on the light and it was gone. I had done no drugs of any sort that day. I eventually just went back to bed after a few hours, and have seen nothing like it since.

The following experience did not happen to me. This story follows the experience of Khun S

Khun S explained that ever since the 2004 tsunami hit Phuket, their bodies were stacked in front of this hotel. Thais are very superstitious, so you could blame this on paranoia, I suppose. Other surrounding condos and apartments near that hotel were left half-way built. Nobody will continue to fund the construction of a building that is near that area where the dead bodies were stacked.

Khun S then explained his own personal encounter. Late one night, and that little chime went off, which is completely normal. He was the only person in the store other than the store clerk, who was busy stocking items and not paying attention to Khun S. However, multiple chimes soon followed Khun S, indicating that more people entered the store. But no one else was in there, other than Khun S and the store clerk. As Khun S went up to the counter to pay for his items

Khun S drove home that night

The next day, because he did not transport any passengers late the previous night. His friend elaborated that he saw Khun S's van was full of passengers.

1359151000.0,17a3os,You'll See Him Soon,HandBanana1780,59,25,7,"It all started when I got a case file on my desk (I work in the DA’s office).  A young woman was arrested after she was found in the home of a neighbor about to stab their young son.  The police report had some really weird parts to it.  
[Cop] was patrolling this neighborhood in a bad area of town in the early evening.  He was nearing the end of his shift and was about to head for the freeway when, radios for backup, and runs up to the front door of the house.  He starts banging on the door and identifying himself as a police officer.  He tells me that he hears screams from a male and two females coming from inside the house and something to the effect of ""Don't do it! Stop!""  Just as he is about to attempt to forcefully enter the house (cops can do that if they have reason to believe someone's safety is at risk) the door opens.  There stands a woman screaming for him to help and she leads him into the living room.  There, he sees a man with his young son in in arms running around being chased by a young woman with a knife.  The officer once again identifies himself, produces his stun gun, aims the stun gun at the young woman, and orders her to stop.  When she ignores him he fires the stun gun
Later, and arranged the skulls around a mirror so that she could better talk to the spirit.  When she had everything arranged she called to this spirit and he appeared in the mirror.  She said he wore a black cloak, was very tall and had piercing red eyes.  The young woman and the spirit talked over the course of a few weeks. It told her that she had to find a living vessel for her son's soul for him to be reborn. 
At the plea hearing a few days later I see the PD and she informs me that the young woman has agreed to take a plea.  During the entire time the judge is going through the plea the young woman is staring directly at me with a blank look on her face.  This is weird as most defendants blame the cops for arresting them and don't really pay the DA's much mind.  But she just keeps staring at me.  Finally
Now
That night, disengaged the safety and checked to make sure that a round was chambered.  
As I open my bedroom door and step into the hallway I notice the temperature in the hallway is at least 20 degrees colder than my bedroom.  I continue down the hallway, I walk up to dividing wall and put my right shoulder up against the wall.  Just on the other side of the wall is the light switch to the living room that sits above my couch.  I take a deep breath, raise my weapon in my right hand and use my left hand to pull myself around the wall and flip on the lights.  
My living room is large, all facing my TV and entertainment system on the far wall.  As the light comes on I scan that area first, take a few steps into the living room and turn to my right near the fireplace on the far wall.  
That's when I see it.  Standing in semi-darkness is a hooded figure nearly 7 feet tall, with a voice like a thousand screams in unison it speaks.  
""He was mine, this time in a low groan, ""Now I take you.""  Then shot towards me.  I'm not sure if I said it out loud or just thought it but the last words I remember were ""God help me.""  

As it crossed the 25 feet between where it was and where I was standing I stumbled backward and fell onto my couch against the dividing wall near the dining room.  Then, brightened to a level that was blinding.  A new voice boomed ""YOU WILL NOT!"" and the last thing I remember before passing out was a blinding light racing toward the dark entity and crashing into it at incredible speed.  

I woke up the next morning in my bed.  I immediately shot out of bed, checking every room.  After the adrenaline wore off I slumped into my chair and cried for what seemed like hours.  I called in sick to work that day, went to my local church and told the priest everything.  He agreed to come over that day and bless my house.  

Some time later I asked the officer he had experienced anything weird after that day in court.  He told me he hadn't and I didn't share my experience with him.  Maybe it was a dream but I don't think it was.  I can't rationally explain what happened but I believe that I was saved by either God or an angel that night.  I've never experienced anything like that since and I believe that whatever the dark entity was it was defeated.  From that day forward you'll find me in church every Sunday.

I have always been fascinated (sp) with the paranormal.  As a kid, my moms mom, who I call my granny, was diagnosed with terminal cancer.  She stayed on her own for as long as she could, being a very independant woman, but finally moved in with us so we could take care of her.

I have to admit that the 6 months that she was with us was very hard to watch.  She went from being very active, looking at the ceiling.  Finally, it got so bad that she had to be placed in a nursing home, where she died 16 days later.

Now

Weird stuff started happening almost immediately after her passing.  My mom had a painting in our hallway, but it was still exactly where it had been put.  The only way the painting could have done that is if there was a force acting upon it to push it off the nail.

The next thing that happened occured several nights later.  My brother and I share a room, when I heard footsteps walk into our room and almost right up to my bed.  I look up from my book and no one is there.  I figured my brother, who was in the livingroom next to our room, had gotten up and it had sounded like I heard footsteps.  So, I go in the livingroom and ask him, but he hadnt moved in a few minutes, so that wasnt it.  My parents were asleep

Two strange occurance also happened to me while I came home to visit my parents during break from college.  On one occasion, so i figured my brother had sat down on the bed, so i rolled over to talk to him, but no one was there.  There was a clear indention of someone sitting there, and it was very cold to the touch, but I was alone in my bed.  The second time, I was almost asleep, but nothing was there either.

All of these things have made me a true believer.  I have tried every way I can think of to replicate these events, no matter how implausible, it the answer.""",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/15ko7c/my_haunted_house/

The first story that I have is one that didn't happen to me, a year or two before I moved in.
He was on the computer late at night, but she was due home in an hour or two. 
He was sitting in a desk that was positioned in front of a window. This was in the second half of the house
All of a sudden he felt a pressure on his hand. He looked down to see a grey hand quickly retract itself from his hand and recede through the window. 
He went to the door and looked out, and they were not strong enough to support a human climbing over them.
He went back to the computer to grab his phone and call the police. Someone had been trespassing on his property and being only 17 or so, and he had neighbours who were constantly arguing and who he believed had a gun). 
When he hung up the phone with the police he noticed something odd
The police arrived and searched the property. Throughout the commotion Marina arrived home and wanted to know what the hell they were doing there. Gabriel explained and she told him to stop being so freaked out

A few weeks after I arrived I told them I had a weird vibe from the house

The room I had had blackout curtains, turn on the light and there would be no one there. One time I had two friends staying in my room, one on the floor and one in my bed. We all heard a painful moaning coming from the open closet, I asked the friend on the floor (nearest the closet) to turn on the lights and check, in case it was one of our cats. There was nothing there. The moaning sounded so human, I just clung to hope that it was an animal and not an ominous supernatural being. My friend turned off the lights and the moaning continued. I asked him to close the closet door. The moaning continued, just quieter

Not long after that I would hear voices just before I went to sleep. I'm told this is normal

I bought fairy lights and would sleep with them on most nights.

I had a conversation with my flatmate, ""Is it a deep voice? Does it sound like an older man, and he only says your name and nothing else?"" I said it did.

There was nowhere for the van to go. I couldn't have gone off the cliff because of the trees and we would have seen it anyway. It couldn't have turned around and sped off because it was only out of view for two seconds...

I would have discounted this as a hallucination or imagination or false memory... but we witnessed the same thing!

I'm certain it wasn't a false memory because I took the precaution of noting what I saw for that reason. I did this mainly because I am someone who has never experienced anything strange and I felt compelled to attempt to verify it.

I look at him and say ""We should use it."" It takes about five minutes to convince him to finally use it. We go out to the living room and set it on the table. Long story short, Joe said. We laughed at this remark. ""There's only one thing that I can think of that could scare off a ghost"" I said. We were quite for a second and then decided to see if there was anything else there one last time. We asked ""Is anyone there?"" ""Yes"", we asked ""When were you born."" Our faces went from excitement to fear as it answered with ""I wasn't."" I figured it could be only one thing. A demon. We continued to push faith and ask it it's name. It answered with a long name that we didn't understand. We asked if it could spell it out again. It did

1376335866.0,1k85fu,My dads spirit?,Bianco10,48,11,21,"I will try not to make this post too long! I have never really had any paranormal experiences up until recently. 
It started when my dad passed away a year and a half ago. He was a heavy drinker. My mum left him because of his addiction when i was 9 (i am now 22), because his body was in such a bad state he was soon on life support as his organs started to shut down. After 3 weeks my sister and i were asked the dreaded question from his doctors, to switch of life support. that night my sister, our half brother and our aunty spent his last 9 hours at the hospital playing music and talking about all our good memories while we waited for him to take his last breath. Once i heard the breathing stop i took my last look at him and ran out of the ward and to the elevator, i just felt like i had to get out of there. once i got to the elevator my mum called me and as soon as i picked up I could hear her crying and she said ""he is gone isn't he?"" I replied ""just a minute ago."" I thought her call was just a coincidence until she said to me ""I know, he woke me up and told me to call you now"". I had never really thought much about that call until recently. About 4 months after my dads death I found out I was pregnant, my partner and I were having trouble in our relationship at the time and split up during the pregnancy. I was extremely stressed with work, family feuds and becoming a single mother. One night I was home with just my dog and I started to bawl my eyes out (raging hormones), as kids he always sat at the head of the table. My dog was jumping up at the chair at the head of the table, dad always use to sing it to me as a kid
Anyway, I have had electrical's plug themselves in and turn on, footsteps a few times, invisible items thrown at me (I heard things smash behind my head but nothing was thrown), things disappearing and reappearing. My partner is a big skeptic and thought I was going crazy for a while until he started to notice things too, like my phone disappeared from right in front of the both of us, after half an hour of searching It was sitting on top of the fridge which I can hardly reach. These things I can deal with but the one thing that really freaks me out is the banging that comes from my son's room every single night between 2am-4am. At first I thought it was my son maybe hitting the side of his cot or something, over time the banging has gotten louder and I don't think there is any possible way he could make that amount of noise laying in his cot. There is no pattern to it
I am a bit confused by it all and would love to hear your thoughts!

1375205783.0,1jd0qp,Childhood Experience: Lady with White Eyes,Myzrath,42,7,17,"This happened many years ago

When I was a kid I used to go shopping with my mom. We would go to the mall and spend a lot of time in Macy's. Before it was Macy's, run-down bathroom. Not many people go back there, simply because it's a long walk and the mall bathrooms are closer. The room is divided into two parts: There's a normal bathroom, and then a ""sitting room"" on the other side with chairs and a mirror. You walk through the sitting room to get to the toilets.

I was alone, and went into a stall. I did my business and came out ... I was horrified. 
There was a woman in the sitting room in one of the chairs. I remember her head drooped to the side
She stared at me as I walked out and washed my hands. I remember this was the first time in my life I felt real fear. I don't remember how it felt anymore

There was something disfigured about her face, I realized precisely what was so awful about her...
Her eyes were pure white with no pupils. They weren't glassy like a blind person's

I walked by her without looking back. I may have even ran out of the bathroom

  So, except what happened to my middle sister that day. My mom was making lunch, while my sister was riding her tricycle around in our driveway. While my mom was in the kitchen she heard a loud thud against the house. My sister came in crying. She said she was walking to her tricycle when all the sudden it was lifted up in the air and thrown against the house. My mom went outside and checked on the bike and to see if it marked the house. My mom said the house had a black streak on it from the bike about 5 feet up the siding. That's not the last time something like that happened either. 

  Second story is also placed in this house, I had a Big Bird Weeble toy, it weighed about 3 pounds my mom said. She had it in my crib, which was in the living room, because it was next to the kitchen which is where my mom was... I don't know why my mom was in the kitchen all the time when I was a kid... but anyway, I was chillin in my crib... haha... and my mom heard a something slam into a picture. She looked over and my Big Bird Weeble toy was across the room and it had broken one of our framed pictures on the wall. It couldn't have been me. I was only 1 and I don't think I could of thrown something that far across the room and knock a picture down. It also weighed too much for a baby to do that.  I know I'm missing a few stories from this house, if I remember them I will post again. Anyway I have one more and it is about my Aunt.
 
 This happened when my mom and aunts were little.  It will be short. One night my aunt had to go to the bathroom real late. As she approached the door she saw light shine underneath the crack, with black and red hair and their skin was kind of wrinkly, she said they were no taller than half a foot and were trying to pry the floor boards up in the bathroom. One of them saw her and looked at her and tolder her to get out! So she ran up to my grandparents bedroom and told them that there were little men in the bathroom tearing up the flooring. My grandfather got up and looked with her in the bathroom and they were gone. She never saw them, I don't think she ever tried to catch them anyway afterwards. But the funny thing is my grandfather even said that after that night happened his neighbor was asking him why the light was on in their bathroom at night. He was kind of shocked to hear that. He turned all the lights out at night before he went to bed. 

TL;DR
My sisters tricycle was thrown against our house and was broken. My toy in my crib was thrown against the wall across my living room and broke a picture. My aunt saw little men in my grandparents bathroom when she was little.

1366345678.0,1cnrp2,Worst apartment of my life.,phoenix_II,45,11,16,"I'm bored tonight
       
**Wall of text. Long story long:**
         
My best friend from college (who we'll call Martha) and I did a study abroad together in the UK. We made plans to move into an apartment with Martha's dorm roommate and and that roommate's boyfriend when we got back. Let's call these roommates Inconsiderate Susie and Too-Loud-In-the-Morning-and-Uses-All-the-Toilet-Paper Larry. Susie and Larry never experienced anything in the apartment
         
In the weeks before Martha and I move in (Susie and Larry have been living there already for about 2 weeks), looked at her with dead eyes and in a flat voice said, ""It's time to get up now."" And then Martha woke up. And then Susie came out of her bedroom exactly as in the dream and said, ""Oh, you're up! I was going to wake you up. It's 7."" So, it's a weird thing but we don't think much about it.
       
So, so we just put on the first stair that leads to the attic and shut the door, and forget about it. We move in and things are going great. Until we make what was probably a stupid mistake.
         
Martha takes some photography classes and figures that there might be some stuff in the attic she can take pictures of. Well, knick-knacks, personal papers, shoes, etc. Just a plethora of stuff from the '40s on up. Martha then takes me up there, and here is our stupid mistake: we take things. I take a wooden sign advertising a summer camp and a ceramic orange. Martha takes shoes. They are exactly her size and fit her perfectly. (Honestly, you'd think we'd never seen a horror movie before. So stupid.)
          
And spoiler alert: this is when it really starts. Martha and I are constantly being watched. We never feel alone and the air in the apartment is oppressively heavy. We are just extremely uncomfortable in the apartment. It's not so bad when other people are around, angry... thing and the energy became very much ""You better get THE HELL out of here RIGHT NOW!"" There were times it was so oppressive that we would just leave and wait for someone else to get home before going back. Once Martha thought she forgot her wallet, so went back for it. As she was searching, she could feel the energy changed and honestly felt like something was chasing her out, so she ran away without her wallet.
         
I was always tired in this apartment. Always. I was constantly in bed because I was exhausted. Now, but I barely got out of bed.
           
A couple months in, but I always try to keep myself closed off.) She didn't do anything, just sort of hung out and seemed to constantly be looking at me. If the apartment was empty, Martha and I were not comfortable sleeping in our bedrooms and would sleep on the couch. One weekend everyone was gone, so I couched it. We didn't have cable, so I put in Larry's Simpsons DVDs so I could fall asleep. For three days straight, I woke up with the DVD on top of the player. The first time it happened, though I couldn't think of any reason I would do that. It was harder to tell myself that when it happened the other two times. Because... why?
          
When everyone came back, I woke up in the middle of the night and through the gap in my blinds could see a black shadow in the window, like it was staring at me. And because of how close my bed was to the wall/window, this shadow was basically right in my face. I freaked out, rolled out of bed like a ninja and turned on the light, thinking that someone had gotten onto the sunporch. (The sunporch had a door that did not lock and the door was across from our front door, so the only way to access the sunporch from actually inside the apartment was through that window in my bedroom.) So, the shadow was gone and there was no one out there. And being on the second floor
         
I got the crucifix back from the attic steps and put it back on my door, right? Ugh. I was in the shower before class and felt something touch me on my side just above my hip. It was pretty cold, a lot colder than the water and it was focused on one spot instead of my entire body like would happen if the shower curtain had opened a bit and air had gotten in. It also felt like a hand. I finished my shower and kept telling myself it was just air because I didn't need anything else to happen.
           
It was shortly after this that I had my worst experience ever. Not just in this apartment, typing out a paper. My bedroom opened up to the kitchen and was right next to the front door. I was just typing away when I heard Martha in the kitchen. In the typical sing-songy voice she used to greet me, she said, ""It's meeeeeeee."" And I stopped for a moment. Thought it through. I froze. I knew she wasn't home. I picked up my phone and texted her, ""Where are you?"" She replied pretty quickly, ""At the library."" I asked her to come home ASAP. So, I'm sitting there, human serial killer was pacing back and forth in front of my bedroom door. I was so terrified I couldn't move. I was cowering on my bed. I put on my headphones and tried to ignore it
          
After a bit, ""No it's not. It's right here."" She was feeling the usual suffocating energy, but 10x worse than normal and I wasn't feeling it at all anymore. Like it turned its attention to her.
           
So we decided to put all the stuff from the attic back because we couldn't think of what else to do. We had our religious friend come over for that. As a joke, ""Open the door! Open the door, please!"" So we opened the door and I wanted to know what that was about, but she said it was nothing. Suuurrrreeee.
             
A little bit later we put the stuff back where we found it, so I was just like *fantastic*.) After that, we went back downstairs and thought, oh, good, it's over.
         
Well. NOPE. As we were standing around discussing our dinner options, ""It's behind us, right?"" She just nodded. And then she felt something brush past her/physically touch her arm, so we just left. We went to get dinner.
         
The energy was slightly better after we put all the stuff back in the attic

Here we go!
When I was ~12

I'm not really someone who's going to get scared by these things, as soon as we touched the pointer it would fly back and forth, spelling 'ZNZ' over and over again. We tried asking questions about it but they would just leave if we did. It happened about 6-7 times with different spirits.

Finally

A few months later I was Ouija-ing again with some friends
They told me the situation. He was a pilot. When I got home, as well as the number of people who he was going to kill. That was supposedly my 'fate'. I didn't think anything of it. The latitude and longitude said I would be somewhere around Florida. I have never been there nor would I ever have reason to go. I dismissed it. 

Well

I didn't think of that piece of paper. 

I had a great time down there

Our connection flight on the way back was in Miami. I was sitting in the airport and it suddenly came back to me. Because I always remembered what that paper had said. And I was sitting at the Miami International Airport on the same day that paper told me almost 5 years previously. 

I remember my heart rate spiking up

We were all sitting in our seats, like always, and tells us about the approximate landing time, weather, etc- and introduced himself as Zachery Zeji (sp?). Z (N?) Z. 

I was shocked at that. But what was I going to do? Tell my mom and brother we had to get off the plane? I didn't really believe this was a premonition that could exist. I didn't say anything. Still
Then, they found a fault in the engine. 

Normally they would just check the records to see if it had been reported and looked at previously

Call it coincidence
I just find it to be an interesting story I went through to share with paranormal junkies like myself :)

TL;DR: A Ouija board predicted a situation that ended up happening to me.

Edit: Pursenboots (lol

#3) I was flying back to California
#4) The first time I wrote it down.
#5) 'He will kill 401' after further 'investigating' we found out they meant 401 people were going to die. Seeing as it was a large plane

Let me explain the layout of the rooms in the story that matter real quick. My room as at the top left corner and my bed is against the right wall. The room is connected to the hallway by the door near the end of the bed. Right across from my room is the kitchen

""Nothing was really off about the night

He threw in the homestyle popcorn my mom really loved and was sitting there. 

""I heard something from your room

My dad went to check it out and he says he saw something that totally freaked him out.

""I wasn't on drugs

What he saw at the end of my bed was a little girl in a black gown, looked at him and then went back to staring at me.

""Holy shit, we didn't let you sleep in there. We brought you into the living room and you fell asleep with us later that night, well I didn't sleep much.""

At first the haunting started out as small things, but as time went on I began to accept it as a normal and welcomed part of my life. 

A few years later, the most we've gotten in decades. I had just gotten into bed when I remembered something I had left in the car. I went down stairs, took the keys and headed out into the cold, closing the door tightly behind me. Once I had retrieved my belongings from the car, I headed back to the house, only to discover that the door had locked behind me. I frantically went around the house checking all doors and windows for possible entry ways. There were none. I tried banging on the door, but no one responded. 

I soon gave up and sat down on the frozen ground where there was no snow. I shivered. I was wearing a tanktop and some flanel pajama bottoms; no clothes for temperatures below freezing. Just as I couldn't stand the cold anymore

This experience is what got me so interested in the paranormal world and I just have to share it with everyone

When I was 16, let's mess around with it. So the three of us headed down to the basement and began asking it questions. I wanted to be a turd and scare them so I started moving the pointer around saying ""yes"" and ""no"" and what not, until my friend caught on and they said ""Let's all just hover our fingers over the pointer!"" I agreed, and thought nothing would happen and this was a waste of time.

When the pointer started moving again

My one friend decides to go upstairs and grab us some ice cream bars from the freezer. The two of us just chilling in the basement where startled when the friend BOLTED back down the stairs

""The kitchen.."" she whispered as she huddled behind me.
I felt my knees tremble
Every single cupboard in the entire kitchen (there was a lot of cupboards) was wide open and EVERYTHING that was in the cupboards was piled into a pyramid type shape in the centre of the room. I felt sick because I couldn't explain how it happened.

I knew neither of my friends had done it because you go through the kitchen to get to the basement and everything was normal beforehand

That night, but ALL THE wallpaper in the ENTIRE house had been ripped down and thrown in the centre of his parents bed.
All three of us stopped being friends after that. I hadn't heard from either of them until my one friend called after seeing a scene in the second paranormal activity where the cupboards explode open I guess. She wanted to confirm that what happened with us was real. And I told her it had indeed happened.
It also took a few years for find out that Baba Yaga is known as a trickster witch in russian folklore.

This, cryptids

The other major form of evidence I've seen is from EVPs. Aside from studies showing that they're most likely [picking up radio waves](http://www.modernageparanormal.com/kb/the_science_of_evps.asp) along with [TV signals, they're also creating a situation ripe for [auditory pareidolia](http://www.polysyllabic.com/?q=node/259), where the human brain's instinctual need to make patterns out of nonsense works to fill in the blanks. That doesn't mean the EVP phenomenon isn't real, but it's likely that the vast majority could be explained away as, well... normal.

Now let's say that someone actually captures a legitimate voice from beyond the grave or from the ether. For example, as opposed to the fragments usually intercepted. And perhaps, in the content of these recordings, they'd say things that support the supposition that they have retained their consciousness after their brains and hearts and bodies have died. Unless you're the one capturing the footage, how would you know that the audio wasn't just made up?

If you're approaching it from the position of skeptical inquiry, and audio recordings could be accepted as evidence these days. And if you aren't approaching it from the position of skeptical inquiry, then... well, then you just believe because you've chosen to believe, which is fine, but then how could your descriptions of paranormal events that you've experienced be taken seriously by others?

1324750803.0,npbc1,Aunt's old house is haunted. Here's our stories.,Udub,37,4,17,"My Aunt lived in this house about 8 years ago. It was a house on Magnolia Bluff in Seattle. It had a fantastic view. The house was built in 1914 and had been renovated on the ground floor and the upstairs (not the basement – it was stuck in the 60’s). 

The first big thing that happened was about a year she and my uncle moved into the house. My aunt was sleeping upstairs because my uncle was snoring too loud in the master bed on the ground floor, and a man yell, “HELP!” She sat her book down and ran down the stairs only to encounter my uncle. My uncle had heard a bang and then a woman yell, “HELP!” They were completely freaked out but tried to blow it off, and then my Aunt felt something brush up against her leg while she was hugging my uncle. 

They both went back to bed, they weren’t footsteps going up the stairs – just from the landing (all hardwood). She didn’t see anyone out there from a shadow, and she hid under her covers. She felt the ghost touch her, before disappearing. My aunt says she stayed under the covers for an eternity before peaking out and going downstairs with my uncle despite his snoring. 
She would have similar instances with the footsteps

However, 50’s) and they owned a Rolls Royce. They often heard loud arguments coming from the house as well. 

When my Aunt and Uncle remodeled the house, “And the rose lies beyond the wall.” My Aunt is just speculating, but her thoughts are that someone with a Rolls Royce who gets frequent visitors in similar cars and has a poem in the basement about a rose could very well be a member of the Seattle Mafia – leaving a rose on the body of the dead. Also, there were bullet holes in all of the walls in the basement (previous owners said it was target practice – still illegal in the Seattle city limits afaik). 

While remodeling, “what’s happening?” and he turned around only to see no one there. He ran out of the house and sat on the grass outside waiting for my uncle to come back home to go get his tools. His visit was free of charge.

When my aunt and uncle had my cousin, even though they would all be in the off position. My aunt had to take all of the batteries out to stop them from going off. 

My only experience caused me to never go into the basement again. I always felt creeped out, my mom, and my little 5 year old sister were babysitting my cousin while my aunt went shopping. We were in the basement where the Xbox was and I was playing. My mom and my sister went upstairs to check on my cousin. About 10 minutes later I heard some running around and voices which I assumed meant that my cousin was up. I turned off the Xbox and then as I turned to go up the stairs, I froze. The hair stood up on the back of my neck, and then out of the corner of my eye I saw a white figure go past the glass door that led to the laundry room. I went upstairs and my mom exclaimed that I looked like I saw a ghost. Not only that, my mom and sister were just reading a magazine the whole time since they went upstairs and hadn’t said a word or walked around or anything – my cousin was still asleep. 

I also forgot to mention the attic doors. Upstairs, but they’d just do it again later. My uncle tied the doors shut so they’d quit coming undone. There was nothing we could do to mimic the unlatching – not stomping, kicking, blowing a fan at them from the attic or the inside, nothing. Also, the front door would fly open even when shut. It blew a hole in the drywall and had to be patched twice before my aunt and uncle just always padlocked the door. 

My aunt moved because of these events. I don’t know the people who live there anymore but I’d like to visit them and ask if they’ve experienced anything

That’s my story – I’ll try and answer any questions as they arise.

My father didnt say anything about what i saw, an older lady and a kid and that they have moved on now. and that was what i had seen. 

A few years later i had a problem with my ankle that wouldnt go away. i had been to the doctor a few times

On Tuesday I was walking back from the store, I thought he was looking at me, but it seems he was looking past me, kind of up and over my shoulder.

I disregarded it the first few times, and no one was further behind me.

He frequently did this over the span of 1-2 minutes before doing a prayer(?) and sprinting off.

Wednesday I was walking back from a different store, maybe 6 or 7 years old, she was clapping her hands, then tapping the table with her palms, she turned to look at me as I was walking past, she covered he face with her hands and hunched herself over until I was gone.


*Thursday*

On Thursday a little black boy, was standing outside my house while I was standing outside, his mother was on the phone just a few feet away.

He said something to me which I didn't quite hear

He then ran up to my front door and pushed it to see if it was open, he kept pointing at the door saying 'I want to go, I want to go!' and began to cry as she dragged him away.

As they were leaving she said 'We'll come back later' in an attempt to shut him up.

*Today*

I live about 100 feet from a primary school and on my way back from work there was a child and his mother talking to another woman across the street from my house.

1373473391.0,1i0kpa,The Friendly Cable Box Ghost,DBrickasaurus,51,21,19,"Short preface: I've always been highly skeptical of the paranormal. Although my skepticism has waned a bit as a result of this isolated experience, so I apologize if this post is improperly formatted

In July of 2011, we'd set ourselves up with a 47"" Vizio HDTV and a Comcast digital cable box, which received approximately 400 channels.

Several months into our lease, and I began noticing that our cable signal would occasionally freeze for about one second, then switch to a new channel without any of us touching the remote. We jokingly attributed the phenomenon to a ""ghost"" in our cable box. Oddly enough, the channel it’d switch to would often be something we were at least marginally interested in watching, e.g. a good movie on HBO or a show we'd never heard of but wound up liking (this is how I discovered Storage Wars on A&amp;E). Now, this observation might be colored by a selective memory bias, but the following sequence of events definitely **is not**:

One Thursday night in late September, and I come home from the bar at around 11:30pm. Ed and Mitt head up to their bedrooms to Skype with their girlfriends (both were in long distance relationships), while I plop down on the couch to watch SportsCenter. When SportsCenter goes to commercial, I reach for the remote to change the channel to Comedy Central, wondering aloud if a new Colbert was on. Before my fingers touch the remote, however, the TV signal freezes for a beat before switching to Comedy Central. I thank the “ghost” for the assist

When Colbert goes to commercial several minutes later, I decide to press my luck by asking him to switch to the HD HBO channel (the box had switched to the non-HD version). As soon as the words leave my mouth, the channel switches to HD HBO. At this point I’m getting sufficiently creeped out, so I call Mitt down from his bedroom to make sure I’m not going insane.

When Mitt arrives, we *never* watched the History Channel. Even if we’d have wanted to, we’d have had no idea which number it was. Mitt suggests that Ed might be playing a joke on us by changing the channel from a remote in his room, which I refute by arguing that a) it’s totally out of character, b) he’s out of range, and c) he’d never know which number the History Channel was. Just to make sure, I quietly ask the “ghost” to switch to PBS (literally no louder than a whisper). Of course, we do a quick sweep outside to make sure nobody is peering through our windows and changing the channel

Next, we ask Ed to name a random channel. He says “ESPN News.” Nothing happens for around 30 seconds. But just as Ed is about to return to his Skype session upstairs, the channel changes to ESPN News. We all fall back on the couch, dumbstruck.

Now, AMC, and Cinemax – not that it matters), I try simply *thinking* of a channel (Showtime). Lo and behold, after around twenty seconds of concentrating on nothing but Showtime (specifically the red letter logo and the channel number), the channel switches to Showtime. I shit you not. Ed and Mitt don’t believe me, so I tell Ed to think of a channel as hard as he can. Around twenty seconds later

At this point it’s getting pretty late. Ed and Mitt call it a night, I go up to his room and ask him to think of a single topic, then I head back downstairs to the TV. Seconds later, the cable box switches to Top Gear on the History Channel. I head back up to Mitt’s room to ask him what he was thinking of. His answer: “fast cars.” When I told him the box had switched to Top Gear, he straight up slammed the door in face and NOPED into bed, hiding under his covers.

It suddenly occurs to me that if anyone else (read: the Internet) is going to believe what we've witnessed, and prop it on the couch so the camera is capturing both the TV and me. I say “BET” out loud. 30 seconds pass. I say it again. A minute passes. I try saying other channels – ABC, Home Shopping Network, MSNBC – but the TV remains on the History Channel. Feeling defeated and foolish for not setting up the camera earlier, I head up to bed.

After that night, it stopped happening altogether. I still regret not setting up a camera to capture what was happening, as to this day it continues to defy all logical explanations we can come up with.

So, and asking it out loud to friends who weren't there just draws concerned looks. But until I figure out what transpired, I’ll remain open to the possibility that there are paranormal phenomena in this world that can’t be explained by science or logic. Even if the phenomena are just benevolent, telepathic, remote-hogging ghosts.


TL;DR: A ghost gained access to our Comcast cable box

1372516757.0,1hb7zc,The house we lived in. A very long post. Sorry.,Hi_Im_Stupid,41,8,15,"I stumbled onto this subreddit and figured I should post the tales of the things that happened at our house when we lived in Tyler
    
This will probably be very long
     
About the house: The house was built in a newer housing development just south of Tyler, between S. Broadway and Old Jacksonville Hwy. Near the Centaur Arabian Farms. It's a really nice house with an odd shaped heated pool with a hot tub, most every house in the neighborhood has a pool and/or hot tub. It has 4 rooms, 3 full bathrooms, 2 car garage, laundry room, great room, kitchen, and the secret room. We'll get to the secret room in a little bit. 3 of the bedrooms and 2 of the full baths are on one side of the house, again.     
   
    
Residents (over the years family came and went): Main residents over all time were my parents
    
Master bedroom (parents' room): Center of room was always cold no matter what. Sometimes, except for a few incidents of the clock turning the alarm off on it's own and sometimes changing the time (either the clock time or alarm time, no discernable pattern). (Me and two of my friends were the only one's in the house for this next incident.) Placed recording device in one of the closets in the master bathroom, pressed record, closed closet door and went to another room with my two friends; I went back and grabbed the device after 5 minutes, it only recorded for 45 seconds. All it recorded was us leaving the room (you could hear us talking before leaving the room), then, a slight hissing sound (like a snake or something), while she recorded on her end, my mother did (if she still has the recording I will upload it)
   
Bedroom #1 (Brother's room): General creepy feeling, sometimes within hours, sometimes within weeks, no discernable pattern.     
    
Bathroom: Lights would turn on and off at random times. We had an electrician come and check it out, plumber had no idea.    
    
Bedroom 2 (Sister
    
Great Room/Kitchen/Dining Room/Breakfast nook: Same as Bedrooms. While in the great room I was talking on the phone to my at the time wife and recording with the camera. My wife asks me, ""Oh, it sounds like there are a lot of people there with you. You're not lying to me and having a party while I'm away are you?"" ""No, in fact I'm filming right now. I'll play it back for you when you get home."" The recording would intermittently pick up what she may have been hearing, lots of voices. I could not really make out what any of them were saying. (Next incident) While returning from the grocery store one evening (mother, brother, and I; Father worked nights), as usual, area towards the hallway that leads to my room, she was at her house with her family.    
    
Garage: No discernable events.    
    
Bedroom 3/Bathroom 2 (my room): Same as the other bedrooms and bathroom. There were sounds of somebody walking above my room, turn on/off, run/close programs, etc. (no discernable pattern) Tried everything to no avail. I finally just unplugged it and did not use it until I moved out, worked fine at other places. PS2, N64, PSP, all and any gaming systems would be rendered useless while in this room. A knocking sound would come from the bathroom door sometimes (no discernable patterns). Apparition of figure standing in doorway would appear at random and then vanish during some nights (no pattern).     
    
Laundry room: Same as bedrooms. Multiple apparitions and sounds. Everybody gets touched.   
   
Kitchen: Touching, opening and closing of drawers and doors. (no pattern)    
   
Storage area: Very
    
The Secret Room: In the hallway that leads to my room, there was a door that opened to a closet. Push on the back wall correctly and voila, secret room. We turned it into a make shift office space. Shadows, apparitions, voices, noises, touching
    
Backyard/Pool: The pool was very difficult to keep clean. I have never had this much trouble keeping a pool clean. It would constantly turn green. If you walked around the pool, hair may be longer or shorter, clothes may, or may not, be different, etc. (This would also happen inside the house, but happened more around the pool
    
Entire house: Dog would chase, possums, neighborhood cats, etc. all avoided our yard. The closest they would get would be to walk along the back fence as quickly as possible if they had to go through our area. They would do this to avoid the dog that stayed in the house behind us. Dog in house behind us would randomly bark, growl, and/or scratch at our back fence for no foreseeable reason. I tried to figure out what it was barking or growling at. I thought might be us, or a random animal, or thing, don't want to be here type of feeling. Randomly, both parties could hear it. The scream would last anywhere from a few seconds up to about almost two minutes. I have never heard anything like it
    
There was never any pattern to any of the things that went on in that house. I would like to go back there and see if this type of stuff is still going on. Nobody has had any problems of this sort, or at least not as out there as some of the things we experienced in that house. The only noteworthy incident that I can mention was when I was walking through my parents new house during the middle of the night, between 1:30 AM and 2:30 AM CST (can't remember exact time), when a disembodied(?) hand, that looked like rotting bone and was very cold and felt like a slightly slimier version of a bone hand, reached out and grabbed my left arm. It was just the hand only, a right hand to be exact. I saw it reach out, and, ever now and again, and are evenly spaced by one inch
   
There are probably many, that I am forgetting. If I can remember any of these, I will add them at the bottom with an edit tag.       
    
If you know of how I can get Hi8 tape recordings onto my computer please let me know and I will find my tapes and upload them for your enjoyment. Also, put them out there, I would like to hear them. Thanks for sticking with this the whole time. I'm currently trying to shove your favorite snack, drink, or item of want through my router right now as you are reading this; I hope it makes it through the internet and to you. :)      
     
Lastly, due to reverse image searching, I feel it may hurt them. One thing I did notice when looking at their pictures, the pool is still green, it looks like they are having trouble keeping it clean as well. Maybe, the stuff is happening to them as well, or it may just be residual from what may have been there.     
     
   
TL;DR - Lots of creepy, voices, apparitions, moving things, touching, etc. People were too scared to stay in house, especially certain rooms. Sorry it was so long (the girls never complain ;) buh dum tsh).     
   
Edit: It was pointed out to me that I probably shouldn't have mentioned that I recorded stuff and not post what I recorded. When I scanned over the guidelines I thought it said I couldn't post links to videos or youtube. I re-read them and saw that I could post youtube videos if it is OC and related to my post. I apologize for any frustration this may have caused. As soon as I can figure out how to get the recordings onto my computer
      
Edit 7/13: Okay I have a friend with a VCR that is willing to let me use it. And somebody else has given me advice on how to hook it up to my computer to record it; hopefully I will be able to do that with my system. I will be trying to find a Hi-8 adapter when I get paid next. Now,False,self,t5_2qjxn,1373705693.0,d,,t3_1hb7zc

On more than one occasion, I saw my mom walk out of her room, look into my sister's bedroom and then stand in the doorway of mine to check on me. I didn't say anything because I'd usually be told off for not being asleep. When she moved away from my door I watched her head into the bathroom. The moment she went through the bathroom door, my mother appeared in her doorway and the whole thing happened again. I just decided I was dreaming.

A few years later I had a worse experience. My street is a dead end and the alleys are perfect for racing down. Each kid would take an alley and whoever made it to the end first won, she was always slow, but as I got towards the end of my alley, she was there. She had actually beat me and come out of her alley and into mine just to show off. I was astonished and got off my bike to talk to her. She laughed at how surprised I was and then because we happened to be standing by her backdoor, she went in to get cookies and lemonade. It was a short conversation and I hopped back on my bike to meet her out front. When I came out of the alley, she came out from the one across from me. She was exhausted and slow, like always. It was clear that she hadn't been to her house at all, did I want any. I was so scared that I was losing my mind that I never told her that I just spoke to her behind her house just a few seconds before and that she already got something to drink.

This incident occurred about 3 weeks after he passed. I had just returned home from work around 6 30 in the evening I was all alone, when suddenly I heard a loud slam on my front door. So loud and hard it made my doorbell almost ring. I froze, thinking it was one of my friends stopping by, then it occurred to me that no one had told me they were coming over and why would they not just knock like a normal person?? So I very very slowly walked into my living room and approached the door. I looked out the window. No one. I opened the door (with a bat in my hand, naturally. Gotta be cautious.) No one. I shut the door and turned around only to see that my tv had come on. I looked at the remote sitting across my living room confused. Then I stood and listened very carefully cause I knew in my gut something else was going to happen. Sure enough I hear noise in the kitchen. My keys were laying on the counter and what I heard sounded like someone picking them up and jingling them. I quietly whisper my exes name, and with that everything stopped.

I think it's some sort of intruder so I shout and kick my dogs out of bed to pave the way for my attack, as they were waiting at their food dish.  I'm not sure, however, as upon testing this morning, you have to have a pretty hefty weight to make the floor boards creak in my hallway.

When I was a kid, right?  There were always other little things too.  But this incident takes the cake.

For backround, early as hell.  My younger brother and I had stayed up particularly late (or what my 12 year old self deemed late at the time) and, he being an early riser regardless of how much sleep he got, I had politely warned him that if he woke me up early (as was his wont) that I would beat the crap out of him.

So, the knock.  Three taps, both times.  The third time I heard the tripple rapping, I was starting to come to.  I grumbled to my brother to leave me the hell alone.  Three more knocks answered me.  Awakening more, I told my brother that I would kick his ass if he didn't go away.  In response I heard three more knocks.

It was at this point that I came out of my sleepy state and recalled that I did not *have* a door.  My brother and I had torn it up while jacking around and, and thus lack privacy, for a month.  Coming to that realisation, I opened my eyes.  At that moment came three more knocks.  

I have terrible eyesight but my hearing makes up for it in subtle ways.  I pinned down the source of the repeated rapping using a crude form of echolocation.  It was coming from direcly in front of me, confirming my echolocation, except I still could not see anything.

Up until that point, just out of eyesight.  At that point, irrational hope set in that the squeaking would creak around my bed and there would be my brother.  I would beat the life out of him but we would later have a good laugh.

When the creaking crept around my bed into my sight range and there was nothing there, I snapped.  

I threw the comfortor over my head and began praying to God (I was a devout Christian at the time) to protect me.  The squeaks kept coming.  When the noise was even with my head, my ear popped and the numbness vanished.  Then, the sound creaked out of my wall (an experience as odd as it sounds) and I was left alone with my mumbled prayers.

So I'm now 18 years old and live with my Brother in our parents house. My Father left us when i was a little two years old child. Then when I was 12 years old I've lost my mother..and there it begins.
First of all I want to tell you what happened before her death. I came back home and she was lying as always sick in her bed, just doing nothing.

I was young and I thought, I can't do anything for her as a child. So at night I went to her bed and gave her a kiss, that was at eleven o'clock at night. She wished me a goodnight and so I went to my bed, because the next day was the day when the first school day starts.
I fell asleep but one hour later I woke up an that was maybe at 1 AM.
I felt not good
I was sweating and my stomach hurt a little bit. I was awake for thirty minutes
In the Morning I wake up and heard people voices
Everytime I'm asking myself If i felt that she was dying at that moment.. 
Sometimes it scared me

But now I'll tell you what I experienced after her death. The days after her death were sad, I was not so much afraid of it, to being without her... It was like she was already gone for a long time and that at least the last part of her, her body, left us... Maybe someone understands what I mean. So however, one evening I went to bed to sleep.
I started to dream. I was sitting in our living room, because there was such a light blinding me and I kept my eyes focused right to this direction. The light becames brighter and I wondered what this could be.Then I had a closer look and what did I see?
I saw my Mother.. She was beautiful, this smile seemed so unworried, peacefully and I saw that she was happy, but I also saw that something was wrong, that there was something that gave her not the rest she wanted.. 
She came to me and in my dream I know that she was dead
I was looking to my mothers husband and said to him: "" Do you see her? There is my mother!"" 
And he just said : "" I can't see her"" I was a little bit afraid and scared because I didn't know what would happen... 
She came closer and then she stood in front of me. And I was still amazed about her beauty
It was exactly her face
She looked into my eyes and said: I'm sorry ( I think this sorry was for what happened all these years

It was sad and happy at the same time. I was sad because I missed her too, that she never gave me for all these years, because she was depressed and never had feelings like love, happiness or joy, for one last time she told me this words I wanted to hear the most... And that she said goodbye to me.. 
I told my sister that story and she cried too and said: U know what? That was our mommy... I wasn't crying when she said that

Maybe that sounds like a story written in a book, really no one can take me my believe that this was my mom saying goodbye to her little child...I hope that you like my story and that there are maybe also people who made the same experiences",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,1344936928.0,,

At the time my then GF and i were renting a 2 bedroom basement in a Split Duplex in Calgary, an upstairs apartment and downstairs on each side of the house. the layout was very straight. there was a hallway with the 2 bedrooms, bathroom and house entrance, then a kitchen and living room with a floating wall between them. our couch was against the floating wall. from that spot, we could see straight down the hallway.

it was about 11 pm, and a close friend of ours were watching a movie. it was some action movie with guns and explosions.  we were talking about something that happened in the movie being completely unrealistic when i felt something watching me from the hall. i looked over and saw an unusual shadow in the hallway. there didn't seem to be anything making the shadow. i went pale. my friend and GF both noticed me looking down the hall, and looked where i was in time to see this shadow (which we later described as a person crouched down) stand up, turn, and walk into my bedroom. as soon as it was out of sight, i launched myself off the couch over my gf's lap, down the hall
it was gone.

i did a through search of the bedroom. there was no one there. it also could not have come in any of the windows in the back of the house

we all saw it. we all separably wrote down descriptions of it

i never saw that again

She got a bit freaked out so decides to run up the last section. As she does however, the footsteps, in her words, chased her up the stairs. There was nobody in the house besides her mother who was already asleep. She told me about it but didn't seem too concerned and maintained that even if there was a ghost in the house she (and her mother) felt it to be a friendly one.

1374815298.0,1j2vrq,My house is haunted,DarlaDimpleAMA,39,8,6,"Hi! :) I hope my story doesn't bore anyone - there is backstory required. I'm sorry!

So, if incredibly boring. The house was built in 1880 by a guy named Whiteside and housed his wife and several daughters. Apparently, the house remained in the family until the 30s or 40s and then had a bunch of extremely short-term owners until we moved in.

Things began happening as soon as we moved in - the home was, a toddler, and a soon-to-be-born fourth child, my parents went about renovating. My mom tells me that since she and my dad stayed up late back then, they'd be up until as late as 2 in the morning and they'd smell strange things in our laundry room. Lavender and smoke were the most common. Nobody in our family smoked or used lavender products, especially at 2 am! It wasn't until a decade ago, long after she stopped having this experience

I'm a fairly scientific person, but some of the things that have happened to me are just... weird as shit, especially because they've happened over a number of years!

The most clear experience I've had is upstairs. My bedroom is up there. In the back of the house is a sitting room we've used for various things, I swore up and down a lady was watching me from the sitting room when I went down the hallway. I've been terrified of this woman for years. I have no idea why she's watching me, and why she's ONLY in that room. My bedroom is next to that room, and my bed is against the connected wall. I hear noises in there fairly often, such as shuffling and just strange, creaky noises that aren't just old houses settling - I know the difference by now, haha. I assumed EMF fields for a long time

And then my mom gave me even more information earlier, with a maid going up there to help her throughout the day. She stayed in that room for years until her death. The room is the creepy room where I felt someone staring at me. Great. I didn't know about this until very recently, and I had no way of knowing a lady was in that room when I was as young as four or five - because nobody else in my family knew, and I never told anyone about this until I confided in my mom that I'd been scared of that room for most of my life.

My best friend (let's say, deceased family members are aware of future deaths &amp; arrivals in the family. We decided to talk to her grandma again. We were both skeptical about the predictions made, but soon after, we had no doubts.

So on Whitney's birthday, so we were still a bit skeptical. We played with the board some more. We chatted with granny a good while, and when we were about to say goodbye, the piece spelled out ""Cookie 3 AM"" over and over. There happened to be a large cookie cake on the kitchen table. It was the room next door. I looked at the clock, it was about 2 AM. Whitney asked ""Are you gonna mess with my cookie?"" The piece moved so quickly, our fingertips left the piece as it still moved. (I get chills every time I think about it.) It stopped over the word ""yes."" I looked at Whit &amp; was like ""Want me to go check it out?"" Before I could even look back down at the board, the piece shot over to ""no."" We shrugged it off, and put up the board.

Well there was definitely more creepy shit to come. Whitney and I were sitting on her couch watching a movie. We were both starting to doze off when I hear this noise coming from the kitchen. To me, and no one's there. I automatically assumed it was Whitney's cat, but that's when I noticed she was curled at Whitney's feet. ""What the hell is that?"" I said in Whitney's direction, stirring her from her sleep. ""Listen,"" I told her. We stared at each other and listened as the shuffling continued. ""Oh God,"" she says, ""The clock."" Goosebumps cover my entire body and I look over. 3:00 AM, we just stared at each other and eagerly listened for the shuffling to stop. As soon as it did, ""Happy Birthday Whitney"" in pretty, and I have no clue why we didn't take a picture.

Time went by. We didn't mess with the ouija board again until my birthday (a little over a month after Whitney's) came around. This time

So we contacted him

The conversation with my grandpa was amazing. But anyway, 2."" I thought about it for a bit, ""You need to tell me two things?""
""Yes.""

""... Anthony? Is Anthony cheating on me?""
""Not yet.""
Sure enough
""Okay
""Baby 2""
""Oh shit... What??""
""Baby 2""
""2 what?""
""2 years""
I didn't respond. I was a bit shocked. The piece began to move again.
""Boy. Blond hair. Blue eyes.""
""I'm going to have a baby boy
All I could think was ""Please say no
""Yes.""
GOD DAMMIT.
""Am I going to have this baby before I graduate?""
""No.""
""Will I be with the father still? Will he at least help me?""
""No. Single.""
Why. Why me.
That hasn't happened yet.

So about the miscarriage prophecy.

As you read earlier, was going to lose two children before a successful pregnancy. Almost exactly a year ago, she lost her unborn baby girl. It was preeeetty traumatic for their family. So shortly after, she announced her second pregnancy. Whitney and I braced ourselves for another miscarriage. Luckily, she carried her (now 9-day-old) son with zero problems. He was born a little early, but is healthy.

So I'm unsure if the predicted miscarriage was wrong

We went to a Taco Bell to eat and he was telling me about how the Mexican drug cartel is out to kill him because he was fronted 10 grand of cocaine that he was supposed to sell for them (which he had done before). It turns out his roommate robbed him so he had to tell them that and they wanted to kill him. He was trying to get money from me so start flipping cocaine to potentially pay them back soon. I just started my job and have rent and car payments so I could only give him about 80 dollars. I then went home and about 2 days later on the news a young male got shot and killed on the same block that he lives at.

A few times throughout my life, I've hidden away in a folder in my mind labelled ""Paranormal."" Four years ago, I met my current boyfriend and after a year of dating, I moved into the house he was staying in. It's him, our older roommate that we rent from, and me living in a three bedroom house. 

Early in the relationship, and a general feeling of not being alone. After I moved in, I encountered my own creepy situations, though I'm still living here so I clearly don't feel like I'm in any sort of danger. One of my best friends has a boyfriend/fiance that, supposedly, is a sensitive. The story goes that after attending a party we had here, they left and he mentioned to her that there was indeed a ghost and went on to accurately describe our own personal reactions to her (we had always considered it a female, which makes sense because he hates talking about paranormal stuff

All of this got me thinking, but, I mean, dirty stuff happens in this house. So, without further ado, my question is this: Is this ghost watching us when we're doing stuff we only do when we think we're alone? Is it watching us masturbate? Is it watching us have sex?

Alright

I'm going to sound like an absolute nut but bear with me. I'm only telling my story here, we'll call her Pam, well Pam is 9 and our parents were evicted a few months ago because they're poor and make horrible choices.
Pam has been out of school since about March that I'm sure of, she lost her house, her school, her friends, all her siblings are nearing 30 and living faw away. I try to see her as much as possible but I'm not in the best of health at the moment. She's my whole world and if I had the financial means to do so, I'd snatch her up in a heartbeat. 
Anyway, she's sick more often than not, I could just cry myself to death because I cant help her.

About two weeks ago I took the train to spend the night and hang out with her. She draws amazingly well, she told me she has a black cat following her but that he's more of a shadow. She also said she's afraid to sleep without tinkerbell, a light she says she sees and thinks is tinkerbell. But what chilled me to the core was the shadow people above her bed that she ""talks"" to in her dreams sometimes and when she wakes up in the dark she still sees them. I asked her what they say but she doesn't remember except for being scared. When she was 3 she told me all about how she died in a fire in a red house and she had a different mommy and daddy. 

Big sigh

I was born into the Leeds family, movies, restaurants, sport teams etc based on this ""devil"" presidents and Napoleon claim to have seen it. Imagine my mortified face whenever yet another relative is interviewed about ""the curse"" on television.
Well, who think we are connected to Satan. They used to steal my mothers pets when she was a child and theyd find them mutilated in the woods, sacrificed to Satan. Every paranormal everything comes back to us. Our family history is riddled with tragedy after tragedy. My uncle swore a demon was chewing on his feet at night he was so frightened he shot himself in the head and survived. He still wont talk about it. My grandmother has been attacked by birds, my mother nearly died twice after her horses spooked up and went after her. We are not allowed to say ""drop dead"" or anything like it, because its happened several times. My mother has predicted dozens of family deaths within days of their passing. All of these stories (and there are many many more) are second hand to me. I thought it was cool and have always had a healthy interest in the paranormal. 
Freshman year I'd stopped believing in God
It was around this time I started having sleep paralysis and insomnia issues. I started seeing people darker than the night in my room just hovering above my bed

I found out later why my birth father was in jail, he claimed to hear the devil through led zeppelin records, blamed my families curse, and said he tried to make it seem as if a ""mad strangler"" attacked her. If you're sluethy this happened in the 80s at a well known army base in the ""devil"" state. Please refrain from posting those links here for my safety and privacy. He does not know what I look like nor my name.

Hes set to be released soon into the same town as my family, all the shadows and nightmares have ceased for 2 years until yesterday.

When I opened my eyes in the dream a shadow person was nose to nose with me and in my father's voice it said ""Mother and Pam"" except it had said their names. I woke up startled to see this white orby looking thing with a tail float out of my room.

The first experience happened years ago. I think I was in the seventh grade (I'm in my second year of college now). I used to have a neighbor that was basically my best friend until high school. Every so often

One night, of course, we ran out of film and set the camera down on a desk across the room. I should mention that we were the only three (me, her, and her sister) at the house. The mother was at work, and didn't get home until very late. We ended up going back to playing games, and suddenly, but we remembered there was no film left. We ignored it

About a week later, she hands me the whole stack and says ""count them."" I was confused, but I started. The camera she had only allowed 40 pictures, so when I got to 41, I was a little confused. However, when I looked at the picture, I was dumbstruck. It was a picture of the three of us, playing our games. No one could have taken that picture, but also

**tl;dr: Went to a friends house (who's house might be haunted) while her mom was gone. Played with a disposable camera. When pictures were developed

My second experience happened eight months ago. This one is much less physical and much more personal. 

At the time, the creepier it makes me feel.

Anyways, saying “Well, I don’t wanna wake her up. But, this is super important. Like, she needs to know now.” I mean, I’m talking to myself like there’s someone else in there with me. Also, my mother has a VERY difficult time sleeping

I get up after a bit, she was. So, I did’t feel bad about waking her up. Then it goes,

**Me:** There's a man in my room.

**My mom:** What?

**Me:** Never mind. He didn't want me to tell you. He's angry now.

And then I just went back to bed.

I can’t explain it. Maybe I'm overreacting. Or maybe I really did have a visitor. But I'd just like some other opinions on this.

First off we are of a eastern European background and there are remote villages where magic is seemingly practiced. I have heard of white witches

Anyway

The weird stuff started happening after her death when my mother and my aunt were tasked with going to her house in the village and getting her stuff to prepare for the funeral. So a week after her death they drove to this remote village on the outskirts of Tver.

As soon as they walked into the old house they smelled cigarette smoke. This was odd but not too odd since the grandma witch did smoke heavily. What shocked them was when they walked into the kitchen and she swears to me that a lit cigarette was in an ashtray

After trying to explain it away they had to stay the night because the drive was far and they were attending the funeral the next day. 

At night was when things started getting unpleasant. Both my mom and my aunt witnessed shadows

I spoke to my aunt and she looked scared and had goosebumps and I asked her why. She said that she woke up for no reason at 3 in the morning and saw a shadow thing/person hunched over in the corner of the room. She said it looked like it was crawling on the ground and then scurried up a wall

He also lived there as a kid and wanted to keep it in the family when my Grandma decided to sell it. I moved there when I was very young and shared a room with my brother. When I got a little older my parents decided I needed my own space and turned

Anyway once i moved in I started noticing strange things happening in the evenings. The most prominent thing happened when I was about 7 years old. I was asleep and I woke up to my blankets hovering over the bed, like objects being moved around and things like that. 

A few years later we were discussing that event at a family gathering and I started to hear stories from other family members who had also stayed in that room who had never shared their experiences. 
My grandma would have been the first in the family to experience anything. She said that more than once she woke up to the feeling of someone sitting on the bed beside her. One of those times it was right on her feet and lower legs.

When my Dad was a kid it was his room for a while. Since it was a really window moldings had warped and couldn't be opened and had they been nailed shut to prevent rattling. My dad says on numerous occasions he would wake up to the curtains ""blowing in the wind"" and when he would get up to check the window - it was obviously closed. He also woke up one night to the closet banging against the wall (same as mine). 

Once my dad became a little older he moved into a bigger room and his younger brother stayed in there. My dad is quite a bit older than his little brother and he and my mom (who were dating at this point) were babysitting him. Only the 3 of them were at home. He heard his brother screaming from upstairs and he ran up to see what had happened. He had seen a hand come around the door and then it slammed shut.

My dads sister claims that she rolled over while she was in bed and saw someone walk out of her room

I don't know of the history of the house or anything about the previous owners but everyone seemed to be sick all the time and we didnt notice it until we moved and realized that no one had had a cold in a few months.

I'm from Morgantown

After a New Year's party at my house, I mean, that place is pretty recently built. My friend told me that she had stayed in this mansion a few times before, around Christmas time. She said she's seen a young boy and a young girl, both wearing winter garments and holding Christmas presents, in the basement of the home. She also saw a man in overalls walking along the docks of the property at night.

For those of you that have seen The Mothman Prophecies, and the bridge was packed with cars. It collapsed from a structural failure with people trapped in their vehicles. 46 died. Rescue and salvage crews found wrapped gifts floating in the collapse wreckage.

So this is where everything comes together. The man who built this mansion decided to get some cheap steel for the foundation. Where can I get cheap steel? Oh

So now his home is made with cursed steel from Silver Bridge. And the spirits that haunt this house get especially perturbed around Christmas time when they died in that tragedy.

My mind was blown when my friend told me what she saw.",self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/yp8fw/mansions_foundation_built_from_famous_bridge/

Interesting, if you're into detective work.",,45,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/tbdwh/how_i_figured_out_who_possibly_haunts_my_house/, though it's not very out-of-the-ordinary compared to other /paranormal posts. Here goes:

My parents moved into a three-story house back in the 70's, I know that the house, in some form, has existed since the mid-1800s (In New England, everything's old). Since childhood, I've felt at times that I was being watched, have heard doors shut on their own, etc. You know

Anyways, some silver utensils and several big planks of wood that looked like they were part of beams, or some house structure. They were, unsurprisingly, rotted and brittle. Some were up to ten feet long and about a foot in girth. There were *tons* of big, rusty nails scattered about - so many that I had to be careful of how I moved. There were also coins, which were too eroded to have visible markings. Lastly, which were clearly part of a necklace but the string had rotted away. 

I showed the treasures to my family

Then it got weird.

A few weeks into my work, I awoke to find the dark silhouette of a woman standing over me, looking down. I couldn't make out much detail, but I do remember the outline of a hat on the figure's ""head"". For some reason, it reminded me of the fancy hats people wore to church back in the day. I felt so afraid that I couldn't move. I closed my eyes and told myself it was a weird lucid dream. I felt goosebumps all over my body, but was sweating profusely. My chest felt heavy and I could feel my heart pounding in my throat. Somehow, though

I told my parents and siblings, until we had a huge family reunion on the fourth of July. There were relatives there who I didn't really know, but got into an interesting conversation with two older, female distant cousins. My extended family had never really moved away from our city, and the adults all played together in the same neighborhood when they were children, as far back as the early 60s. Somehow, we got into discussing paranormal-type stuff, one cousin said something like, and the two women exchanged a look of utter shock. They explained that they used to play in my house sometimes, playing in the neighborhood as kids do. They said they stopped going to my house when they started to experience unexplainable happenings as well: a laundry list of all the things I had been experiencing since childhood. I've since moved out.

About a month ago, I finally found the information for our house: one family, including a husband, wife, mother-in-law, and six children lived in my house. By the wife's name was an asterisk, with a note which read ""unable to work - very ill"". 

Did the woman die shortly after this data was recorded? If so, who finds this all very interesting, believes that I unearthed property belonging to ghost (whoever it is), which caused it to increase its activity, hence my visions. Farfetched or legitimately spooky?

Anyways

It takes some time

**TL;DR** I always felt there was a ghost in my house. I used released census data to find out who it could possibly be: a young woman who was reportedly ""very ill"" in 1940.

I'll just explain some particular instances of what may have been visitations. Then I'll get to the reason for the title of this post. Apologies in advance. This will long and boring.

As long as I can remember

**The Old Lady**

It all began with the old lady. I'd hear her down the hall

I'm actually scaring myself now.

The old lady would creep towards my bed. I would try to scream

Then she would lean over my bed and... the moment before I could see her face

This happened countless times, did I actually see her face. It was a familiar face, and not particularly frightening. It was similar to my aunts on my mom's side of the family (the Lebanese/Armenian side).

If I recall correctly, which was in the corner. You had to turn to see it. She walked past my bed, and then she was gone. 

That was the last I saw of her.

**My mom's best friend. Died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.**

My mom's best friend killed himself when I was maybe fifteen or sixteen. No one is really sure why

The guy was really cool

Anyway, and felt more at ease when I did.

I slept on the living room couch often at that age. My parents didn't get along and slept at separate ends of the house

Anyway, my mom's friend, just a foot or two away from the couch. I wasn't paralyzed. But I couldn't turn away.

His face was swollen, where his heart would be. That's where he shot himself.

He looked down at me and said

And then he was gone.

I told my mom about it the next day. She wasn't the one who found his body

Then I described what he was wearing. It was exactly what he had on the day he died.

I never seriously considered suicide after that.

**My childhood friend killed himself too**

Rich was my best

A few years later, the phone rings. It's the parents of another friend. Rich had been found parked alongside an old country road, dead from car exhaust asphyxiation.

I was laying in bed a year or so later, tell him what a terrible friend I'd been, and ask for his forgiveness.

I rolled over, but I knew it was him. In my mind, I saw his swollen, discolored face. It looked nothing like the the showing at the funeral. There, his face was caked in makeup. Hard to the touch (yes, I touched him).

I was terrified. Too afraid to turn around and face him. So

**Recently**

My episodes sleep paralysis tapered off quite a bit as I got older. I have them now maybe once or twice a year. Sometimes they're not even frightening at the start. My last two were *really* close to lucid dreams

During one of them, helping cook a turkey. It was interesting and quite a trip.

Then things in the film started to get weird.

Then they got downright frightening.

Then I heard the voices. And

**The Voice**

In every one of the last ten or so episodes of sleep paralysis

Sometimes the episodes start with shadows that become twisted creatures that swirl around me. Then come the voices. Dozens of them. Whispering. Laughing. Deep voices. High pitched voices. I don't know if they whisper in another language

Then I hear The Voice.

The Voice is loud. And, oddly enough, the same ear that gets clogged most often).

Before I hear him, I feel a kind of Lovecraftian terror I couldn't possibly describe.

Up until Saturday night

That brings us to Saturday night. I'd fallen asleep on the couch, when things started to get weird. And, for some reason I asked myself, ""Am I possessed?""

I heard the same voices

Then I was back on the couch

The Voice laughed in my ear and said

When I was about 4 years old, so it was pretty large for our family home. I heard my dad talking about how the property, and how the backyard was so big because it and the properties surrounding it used to be part of an orchard and nursery. The land was to be split up and sold after the orchard began to fail, and eventually the owner, who lived on the orchard, had lost everything, and hung himself from a tree.  
Now that's just the story—my mom never believed that that's what really happened. Years had passed
Anyways, (I call my grandmother ""Nanny,"" and she is an avid smoker.) Eventually my mom got up and explored the house, and realized that the kitchen smelled like cigarette smoke and coffee, even though my parents didn't drink coffee or smoke.  
As we started to recognize the smell
Later, I guess just because of an overprotective instinct. But the problem was that I would stay up late every night, unable to sleep. Sometimes my parents would check on my sister and I before the went to bed. I could hear them enter the hallway, make a couple shuffled footsteps, then turn around to go upstairs.  
Now I don't remember this at all, but I explained that I clearly saw her shadow. I thought she was spying on me, waiting for me to go to bed, but she wasn't.  
Eventually it got to the point where I decided that I was going to surprise her one night while she was ""spying"" on me. So when I noticed the shadow, but instead I saw a shadow turning the corner. I ran after her, but then heard my mom's voice saying ""Hans, is that you?"" from upstairs, the opposite direction of the shadow.  
It was at that point that I started to think that something was in the house. I was very curious about ghosts
One day, but before I could make out what it was, the figure disappeared.  
I thought forever that the figure was a ghost
As a teenager
So fast forward to present day: my parents got divorced and my mom moved into a condo about 10 minutes away. My dad lives in the same house. I'm living in my own apartment now, and tried to protect me from being scared of what she believed to be the spirit of the orchard owner.  
Nowadays it's not uncommon for me to stop by and visit. My sister still lives there, because I hadn't. It's especially weird though, because if I'm ever at my dad's house alone for some reason, I can sometimes smell coffee and cigarettes.

Sure enough, it was exactly 4:32 when I looked at my cell phone and a text from my mother, which I had yet to read yet.    

I put my phone down for a second and thought about the dream I just had.  I was at my high school and my deceased great uncle was in the auditorium with me.  It was packed

This is when the dream became weird, walked up in front of the cabinet and began telling me really mundane, boring stories about his life on Hollywood movie sets.  I slowly walked away and this banging came from the cabinet my vampire great-uncle was in.  I figured was getting tired of Nic Cage's stories.

Background info: Me, bathroom, living room/dining room, and a kitchenette. We live on a second floor, I would describe the whole thing but it's not really important to the story so I'll just describe my bedroom since it's where all this is happening.


Our bedroom it's the last room in the apartment, our bed is placed in the middle of the room.


My girlfriend works in the morning and I work second shift at a restaurant, showering and then go to work. One day I was taking a shower when out of the corner of my eye I saw movement in the bedroom. The way the bathroom is built let's you see the bedroom when you're taking a shower (we have just a clear plastic curtain.) At first I thought it was my cat jumping to/from the bed, but when I got out my she was outside the bathroom staring at the room and moving her tail really fast. Up until now she refuses to go inside our room unless we carry her inside.


I didn't pay much attention to this so I just went with my day as usual. Everything was normal until one night something woke me up I heard little creaks and scratches inside the closet, I kept hearing the noises but not only in the closet now they came from different places around the room. I check the traps every day and they are always empty.


Last week I woke up around 3:00 or so to the creaking and scratching, two human shadows moving around my room, they would disappear and then come back, I was fucking scared I just got close to my girlfriend and hugged her, she woke up and half asleep asked me what was going on, I just told her that I was cold and wanted to cuddle. I haven't told her anything, I don't want to scare her. And ever since that night I see those shadows. And two nights ago I heard knocking on my window, but at the same time I'm scared to find out.

Me and my mom were talking to this guy who was renting this home. He started showing us around the home and then the basement. When we walked down I saw butchered meat all over the place like it used to be a slaughter house. I didn't say anything because my mom and the dude didn't say anything about it. Years later I finally tell her what I saw and she told me she just saw a regular basement. He told my mom it used to be a full basement but they walled off 3/4 of it. I forget the reason he told my mom.
My mom ended up renting the house and sometime later saw a loose brick in the wall and she told me it looked like it had furniture in it but had sheets over it. We both thought it was odd that if they were to seal a room up why would they leave furniture in it.

Months later my mom marries my now ex step-dad and odd things started happening.
My brother has never slept walk in his life
Strange things started piling up. I didn't find out a lot of the strange things because my mom and brother and sister didn't want to freak me out.
She told me about how in the middle of the night she would hear dishes and pots and pans in the kitchen being moved loudly and would investigate and see nothing.
Another time a handyman was supposed to come over and fix the stove. Not a cooking stove but a heater. So she hears a ton of noise like people fucking around with pipes. She assumes it's the guy but then the guy knocks on the door and he isn't dirty so it couldn't of been him.
She told me once in the middle of the night she work up to hearing someone laugh in an evil voice and then look at a portrait above her bed and see red eyes on it.
One time she told me she went some where and when she came back to the house from going some where the window curtain was open and the string that you had to pull was pulled to it's maximum length and it was pointed to the basement.

My brother and sister told me that one time my parents were away at a store or something and they were doing dishes. I was sleeping
I'm sure there are more stories but the last one I remember because I was there. My mom was walking up the cement steps to the front door (it was only like 3-4 steps) and she fell backwards hard and was hurt and was bleeding from her legs. She said later it felt like someone pulled the legs out from under her. She goes to the doctor and finds out
After that happened things returned to normal and the weird things stopped happening and we moved. She said she asked the new people who moved in if anything weird happened and they said no.

I'd be curious as this happened about 31 years ago so I wonder if there is some database of haunted properties to see if anyone else experienced anything bizarre since then or how to look up the history of a house/property.

Please pardon any grammatical errors.

I was walking home from school tonight and I have to walk through this tunnel underneath this set of train tracks. It’s pretty creepy but I’m used to it by now since I walk through it every day. Anyway so I’m walking and ordinarily I don’t really see anyone else going through there

Then as I was passing by the space between the two train tracks (which is a really creepy overgrown, it whispered right in my ear. I don’t even know what it said but I felt breath. It legit scared me so freaking much, I couldn't even breathe. So I’m standing there like an idiot completely unable to move feeling like my heart is going to burst from my chest. I’m scared to even look around to see who it could have possibly been but it was right in my ear I would have seen them, but there was absolutely no one. So I stand there a little bit waiting for something else to happen but nothing ever does so I take a step forward and then something physically hits me. It was like a really hard gust of wind except it was like, solid and it hit me in the neck/chest so hard I fell back on my ass.

I’m not kidding I sat there for probably a good 15 minutes hiding my face in my coat before I could even make myself crawl away and then finally get up and run home.

So last time I posted the banging on the wall had just happened. That was absolutely terrifying. I started to feel uncomfortable in the shower

The voices at night got worse, sometimes terrified. Always the same guy in his mid to late thirties screaming my name though. He never said anything else.
At a party one night I knocked a bottle of perfume out my window and it shattered everywhere on the concrete below my room. We had a gardener who would clean up accidents like that so I didn't bother sweeping the glass up.

About a week after I dropped the glass I woke up suddenly during the night. This was not uncommon as I had insomnia. I looked at the clock. Three A.M. Witching hour. I turned over and tried to get back to sleep. Then I heard footsteps. I was used to the sound of the soft padded footsteps that I would often hear in my room. These footsteps sounded like heavy workbooks coming from outside my room, but then louder. The sound of fingernails on glass. The sound of something scratching to get in.

The scratching eventually stopped, thank god, I am safe. That feeling did not last long. It was about ten minutes before the footsteps resumed, then the crunching glass, then the scratching. I was petrified, too scared to leave my bed to go and get one of my flatmates. Eventually it stopped altogether, and I fell asleep.

The next morning my flatmate came into my room, then they started scratching on my window. After about ten minutes they would leave, and in ten minutes they were back again"". Someone, or something, has been outside my room, and then would go to my flatmates room (which was the next room from mine) and then would come back to my room. I pulled my curtains open, to check if the glass had been trampled
Not long after that Marina was in her room, Luke, and I, Jarryd and Dion had left at this point). We heard a blood curdling scream, and her screaming in tears for us to please come into her room. We all ran in and she was sitting up against the closet, hysterical. We asked her what was wrong. She pointed to the window opposite her, the second window of two that she had in her room. The window that was about two metres off the ground from the inside. The window that would have been at least three metres off the ground from the outside. The window that someone from the outside could not have possibly reached.

There was a fresh hand-print on the window.

Luke immediately went outside to investigate. There was no one outside

All of the doors and windows were locked.

Well

What happened to me was also in the kitchen along the open path others have felt something. To give a visual, nor are there any air vents or windows that could push a breeze to that point. 

One day during a bonfire, the AC wasn't on. I proceeded to walk out from the kitchen to the door leading to the deck when what I thought was a cicada hit me in the top/back of my head. We have cicadas like crazy here in the midwest. I slapped around my head saying, ""What the fuck?"" trying to find out what hit me. I looked around for a bug only to find nothing. It was silent in the kitchen. No fans, no heat/AC, no windows open.

Let me explain the feeling in detail, hold it close to the top of the back of your head and flick the 4 fingers upward across your hair/skull.

This is what I felt. Well, but there was nothing around me. A draft or blow of air couldn't have caused this same sensation.

One of the most common openings to experiences recounted here in /r/Paranormal is ""When I was a child..."" The problem is that [adult recollections of childhood experiences are about as accurate as chance](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2000/06/000602073735.htm). Because we know this

Perhaps you've experienced a series of extremely unlikely coincidences related, the [Baader-Meinhoff phenomenon](http://www.damninteresting.com/the-baader-meinhof-phenomenon/), [this article on ""patternicity,""](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=patternicity-finding-meaningful-patterns) and [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/tq3rh/addressing_the_most_common_paranormal_claims/)), or whether it's a matter of statistics (see: [Black Swan theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory) and the [Law Of Large Numbers](http://www.probabilitytheory.info/content/item/6-the-law-of-large-numbers-/-the-law-of-averages)), we do know that unlikely things happen *all the time*.

Maybe you've taken audio, it doesn't seem that there's [any way it can be considered evidence](http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/tcyzi/considering_how_easy_it_is_to_fake/), as all three forms of media are too prone to defect and hoax to consider empiricism. Maybe you've seen something unexplained with your own two eyes, but [optical illusions](http://bigthink.com/artful-choice/do-my-eyes-deceive-me-optical-illusions-framing-and-choice) have shown us just a sliver of our brains' annoying ability to [deceive us](http://blog.brainiyak.com/?p=2151) via things like suggestive intuition and imaginative eyewitness testimony, not to mention the previously-mentioned problems with [the accuracy of our memories](http://www.skepdic.com/essays/teachingCT.html):

Those who use this as a reply, I think, aren't truly grasping just *how extraordinary* a paranormal claim is, and so it is much easier to resort to a paranormal explanation in order to explain something that they cannot explain. This is evident when looking at polls of paranormal beliefs. [This one, from 2005, with only subjective experience to offer as support

I wonder, but knowing something... that takes rigor, study, patience, repeated experiment, revision when evidence demands it, care,"" but this is an incorrect use of ""know."" This isn't knowing. It's believing

But beliefs are strong, in an attempt to show them that the Ouija requires thinking, observing, cooperative humans in order to ""work,"" but it won't make a difference. If someone wants to believe something badly enough, evidence is often considered irrelevant, wrong, titled ""How Facts Backfire

It wasn't until age 17 I realized I'd had my fair share of ""paranormal"" experiences. After this realization I'm not sure if the reoccurring events are slightly influenced by paranoia or poor ""debunking."" Slowly the incidents became more and more difficult to explain and made their way in to my personal life.

Here's a quick summary of what I've experienced.

At 16 I was playing xbox home alone when I heard various bangs it the bathroom adjacent to the room I was in. I knew I was alone and walked to the bathroom with my fists up

Same year, and only on the inside of the two window panes. My father blamed me later, saying that I ""threw the controller at the window,"" which wouldn't make sense because the crack was a clean and fairly straight line, not ring shaped as I assume it would be from an impact.

Same year

By 18 I'd had my fair share of strange experiences (more than those above), my bed would shake when attempting to fall asleep. Not only that, but on occasion I'd wake up in the middle of the night with a sort of a 6th sense that someone was in the room with me. I never physically saw anything, and can't explain how I've seen what I've seen, but I'm come to determine that on these nights, a middle age women with blonde hair(maybe 35 or 40), is in the room. This happened on multiple occasions and I never really felt threatened

I went to college

About half way through the year, making banging sounds against the wood door. It became more violent over about a 30 second period and I could physically watch the rack (about 5 feet from me) move back and forth, separating itself from the door. In the morning I checked to see if you could move the rack from the outside, and it was impossible. I didn't mention it to my roommate, but later the next day he asked if I too saw the rack move in the previous night. This happened on 2 occasions during the school year.

I've had more similar experiences, but I have woken up to the woman laying next to me. It's like my eyes at the time had a filter between what was ""actually"" there, and not.

I've come to live with the fact that sometimes

I instantly covered myself with the blanket I was using. A couple of minutes later I slowly looked for the figure, and it was still there.

1362444721.0,19oamv,Creepy stuff at Nursery Road,imanicole,45,14,15,"SOOOO basically, I have noticed some screwed up stuff. This post is basically me just venting all this fucked up stuff that has happened since my parents refuse to believe it.

So it started when I was around 4 years old. It wasn't even in my house, I kept seeing a family of 5 dressed in big, heavy clothes. It was only shadows. I kept asking my dad ""who is that daddy"" and he thought I was imagining things. The feeling of them got so distressful I burst out crying and my dad had to literally carry me out of the place. I had no fucking idea who King Henry the VIII was then, let alone he has a family of 5 and wore ridiculous clothing. Since then, things in my house have been weird.

I think the creepiest time in my house ever is when it's dark, a silhouette. I went under my bed, thinking it was a dream, pinching myself and yet again, peaked over the duvet and he was still there. Frozen in fear, I  just convinced myself I was imagining things and went back to sleep.

Over the next few years, but every so often, she would start giggling. I live in a detached house, so there is no way it was neighbours who were talking. On top of this, I would hear someone go up the stairs a few steps and stop. Even the banister would creak. Yet again ""It's all my imagination, go to sleep"". 

Stuff even started to happen in the day time. If I was on the sofa facing away, when I was 12, I went upstairs in the daytime and I swear to God I saw my mum's hand curl around her bedroom door. There was her rings on the hand, yet she was at work at the time. I couldn't stop crying and a few years before hand I read that if you saw a families ""ghost"" then they or their relative would have a serious health scare or die. Not even 2 months later, my grandad had an anyurusm and died twice on the operating table. Fortunately he pulled through, however that room became a no go zone. I was brushing my hair, ready to go to school and I heard and felt someone breath down my neck. Even at 20 years old

When I was 18, fumbled with my coat then that's when it happened. I heard someone knock on the hollow wall next to me 3 times. I ran upstairs, got under the duvet and put it down to the alcohol.

Unfortunately, 21 year old man and he doesn't believe in anything paranomal, but he refuses to come to my house anymore. I have never seen him cry that much, even when his dad died.

The other day, I suppose they were feeling a bit more open. My dad said that when he was younger, he use to have an older friend who use to play with him. However, no one else saw him and swore it was an imaginary friend he had. My mum then went on to say when she is upset, she can hear her dead grandad telling her that everything is alright. They then went on to say they did an ouija board before I was born and a dark spirit lifted the glass and flung it across the room and broke the damn thing. In this house.

Since my younger experiences, even though no one is there. I've even seen shadows in my broom closet room that shouldn't be there. As I write this, I feel a strange presence and hear the floorboards moving, without anyone being awake. I don't know what the hell it is. Maybe it's my deceased great grandad, looking over me? Maybe my parents invited an unwelcome visitor into the house? Who knows? All I know is I'm glad as hell I live 300 miles away and only come back for a few weeks a year now.

a bit of backstory: My aunt has always been the sensitive one in the family having paranormal experiences her whole life whether it be at her own home or on family vacations.  She has tons of stories and I loved listening to them.

Continuing with my story, my girlfriend, and myself.  So we end up going out to dinner and coming back to the house to watch a movie before bed.  After the movie, Mal goes to bed but of course, the boys want to play.  So I build a fort for them in the computer room, which is upstairs with the rest of the bedrooms.  I remember building it in such a way that the bedsheet was tied to the inside door handle so that they couldn't leave the room (they wanted to sleep in the fort) or the fort would fall apart. Genius, i know.

So everyone goes to bed eventually.  My girlfriend and I sleep in the master bedroom in my Aunt and Uncle's bed, everything.  Here's where it get's weird.  Out of nowhere I wake up from a deep sleep to notice the ceiling fan on as well as the ceiling fan light.  The bedroom door is wide open.  The master bath door is cracked open and the light is on in there as well.  And to boot, the dog is in the room staring at me and she shit on the carpet next to the bed, something that I was told NEVER happens.  

I got up to check things out and everyone in the house was sleeping.  The fort was still intact, so it wasn't her either.

As to the setting of all of these, just off the kitchen through a very small hallway that also has the washer and dryer in it. In an open circle of rooms is first the kitchen, then the Den (living room) and the living room (fancy dining room). The living room and den both connect to the entrance way and then you turn to the left and around to the big hallways, which has three bedrooms connected to it, two on the side and one at the end, and a bathroom. The majority of these experiences happen in my room, the kitchen

I had my first experience 6 years ago, and 5 year old niece were all in my room having a pillow fight and just generally making a ruckus. I was standing with my back to the closed door and the two of them were standing on the bed. All of a sudden, in the middle of the pillow fight, my nephew yelled ""Look!"", which stopped us all in our tracks, and I looked back at the door. For what felt like minutes the three of us all stared as the doorknob slowly turned from side to side.
Me, which, sure enough, they hadn't.

Later the next day after they had left, when I say this doorknob was rusty, it was *rusty*. My Grandmother, niece and nephew, and occasionally even me had trouble opening that door.

Over the course of the next three years only minor things would happen; a feeling of being watched at night, I was scared to be alone, but I eventually got used to it. Over the course of those three years though, I had become very interested in the occult, and had finally convinced my dad to buy me a Ouija board, which I tried out at the first chance I could with my older brother, who had been visiting at the time.

I didn't realize how big of a mistake that was until the next night.

The next night was the first night things started to pick up. The footsteps that had been originally confined to outside my door moved to beside my bed, however, I never did that for a shaking bed again, despite it happening several nights a week.

One night, and I was an extremely heavy sleeper so nothing ever woke me up. I realized what had woken me up when I opened my eyes, however. Right there, above my face, was a huge shadow hand reaching for me. I jumped out of bed and across the room, turned on the light and looked around and saw nothing, and I had never and have never seen a shadow like that since. That was the second time I ran to sleep in my mom's bed.

The final major event that has happened in my home to me was probably the scariest. 
I had just laid down to go to sleep around midnight when I felt a slight burning on my thigh, god be damned if it disturbs her.

I have other stories of my own from outside of that house, and my brother's dad's. This has already gotten too long so I'll post the others later if there is enough interest. Also, no, I don't use the Ouija board anymore and very little has happened since then. ",,False,self,False,t3_xfbxj

* Get pictures of the roof of the ""engine house"" (I may not be able to get ontop or high enough to see it
* Get Pictures of the rotating stone door's joints
* Video of me Rotating the door (That will be your ""proof
* Anything else I find interesting that I have not yet seen

As long as my battery holds out and I have cell service I will try to upload pictures every spare moment I have. Cant upload videos on the go to skydrive.

... Anyway, The Rock Gate at the entrance was made in the same way as the 9-ton Gate but has never rusted out or been taken apart and as such still ""glides"" with a single finger. The sight is quite stunning and I wish I could have taken video of it. They where kind enough to let me climb up a bit and take pictures of the top and bottom joint of the 9-Ton Gate as well as a picture leaning on it. It seems that although areas some are barred off, they will still let you touch if you ask.

About five years ago

In the first hour of arriving, ""Six..."" in my ear.  I quickly turned to look around me, but no one was even close to me.  The only way I can explain this voice was if, literally, someones lips were half an inch away from my ear and it let out more air then vocals.  It was a whisper and it even tickled a little.

I immediately turned to my friend and tapped him on the shoulder.  He turns around and I say, submersed in a story, I briefly forget about what just happened.

Then I hear my player friend. ""Hey...hey!  It hit six.  So..what else you got?"" He said half-jokingly.

I was shocked

Fast forward to last night.  After a few beers my friend talks me going into a local casino with him.  This place doesn't have live table games, before I lost it, to ticket out and go get my money.

My friend was continuing to play at that same roulette table as I walked around the casino checking out other games and just observing the community.  There wasn't much I was into so I walked back to that same table

This time

I quickly took out and dumped 20 bucks into the machine and was able to drop 15 dollars on six before all bets were off.

Just in time.  Six.  It hits.  I cash out and go get my money from the machine.  I come back quietly and sit their puzzled.  Oddly enough this is the same friend who wouldn't take my advice five years ago and also remembers.  He looks at me and says

Do any of you have occurrences similar to this?  Can anyone help me identify what is happening?

1376409097.0,1ka7zg,Haunted Pharmacies,vi0letwaves,33,4,18,"I worked at a CVS for about seven years

I think first it's important to learn the history of the properties that these pharmacies were built on. The first one I had experiences at was built on a plot of land that housed several types of businesses before CVS ended up there. Before CVS it was a restaurant (that my mother worked in and had her own paranormal experiences at) and before that it was a carriage house/tavern back in the 1800's. The carriage house burned to the ground and a woman died in it. 

I worked at this location for about a year and had some really strange things happen that I just can't for the life of me explain logically. One night I was walking past our photo counter and a pack of labels (basically the same as a ream of paper, our stock in the back had a nice habit of doing that as well. My mother said when she worked at the restaurant that was there (years ago, back in the 80's) that they would come in to find bread all over the place. Like someone had just thrown it around. 

Another time our fire alarm got ripped off the wall (the red, they discovered it had been violently ripped out of the wall. They had to duct tape it back up to get the alarm to stop sounding. 

Some of the other employees had different experiences

The second CVS I had paranormal experiences in was built on part of the old Huber farm here. There was at least one confirmed murder on the land and part of the original land included a good sized cemetery down the road. I worked overnights at this store and I think that's why we had so many more experiences here. I'm honestly not even sure where to begin with this one. Mind you, everything else I'm about to tell you happened with just me and my coworker there.

The first weird thing that happened to me there was hearing children giggling. This happened once in a while and sometimes I would think I'd catch a glimpse of a shadow in the direction the sound came from. 

Another time I was walking back up to the front of the store and I passed an aisle and saw a man. About 6', dark hair, attractive. I stopped really quick and backed up to double check because I didn't think anyone was in the store. He was gone in the two seconds it took me to take two steps back. I walked through the whole store twice over and there was nobody in there. 

Another time I was standing in our backroom (on the main floor) in the middle of the room. There wasn't anything within ten feet of me

Many of us heard disembodied voices. One girl, Jeff, and I were walking up the steps together after clearing the store and we both heard a man yell ""hello?"". We both stopped dead in our tracks and ran back down to make sure nobody was there. The store was empty.

The next few things happened when my friend, Tabby and I see a guy dressed all in white ran past the front door. It was enough that it triggered the motion sensor and opened the door/rang the bell. I said something to Tabby about the guy moving so quick and she was like ""I know, right?"" and the woman in front of us just turned around and said ""What guy?"" We all ran out into the parking lot and there was no one there. We checked the cameras and he wasn't on them. You can see the doors opening, but there was no guy. There was no guy coming through the parking lot either. 

I think the scariest thing though was the thing that happened just before I left CVS. It was about 3AM one night and it was just me and Tabby in the store. We were standing at the front counter talking. I had my back to the office (our office was elevated above the coolers with the one way mirror deal going on. You could sort of see in when the lights were on - only the managers had a key to get in) and Tabby was facing me talking. Out of nowhere she stops mid sentence and gets this creeped out look on her face. ""I just saw something in the office."" she said. At this point, our cameras were bolted to the ceiling. They didn't move, they didn't turn, there was no wiggling them. Right after the camera started recording it started violently shaking, like there was an earthquake or something going on. Then, right before you see us appear from the steps this green, demonic looking face appeared in the glass. Mind you, but I lost the DVD sometime during the years since I left there. I wish I still had it

Reluctantly I agree to this and we part ways. Using our iPhones we kept in close contact using a walkie app. After close to twenty minutes my friend calls me.
""Did you just go up to the 4th floor?"" he asked
""No I'm on the ground level. South corridor.""

It was silent for what seemed like forever. It was only about a minute but when all you can really hear is your own heart beat it seems like a long time. Then I damn near jump out of my skin when i hear my friends voice over the phone telling me
""Nope! Done! I'm headed back down to the front doors.""

I quickly went to the front doors and my friend tells me after hearing what sounded like a door in the stairwell closing he went to go check it out. He explained he thought at first it must have been a worker but I assured him that he and I were the only ones in the building when he first showed up. Once we got to the top (4th floor) he was met with a long dark hallway.

He told me once in the hallway it felt really quite to the point that it was unnerving.

He turns back and continues down the hall then hears a loud bump similar to how it would sound if someone one floor above you were to jump up and down. That single hollow thump was unheard by me but he tells me it was right behind him and right after the thump he hears a low groan by his shoulder. Then he ran.

He then apologized to me and told me he is leaving. I told him good night and let him leave.

There's really no good way to describe it...it was maybe three feet tall, and it could see in the dark (clearly, since it was looking at me). **I should note at this point, my room never gets completely dark, I live right by a well-lit street and it's never entirely black in my room.** As soon as I came to the realization that I was, in fact, awake, bolted across the room

Needless to say

Now, last weekend, I saw the same thing again in my room. This time, I woke up and it was sitting on my counter (right by where it disappeared last time) and was sort of kicking its legs while staring at my room. It looked kind of like a kid sitting in a chair, honestly. I sat there staring at it in the dark for probably a full minute before I reached for my lamp. While struggling to find the lamp switch, I turned my head for barely a split second and when the light turned on and I looked back, the thing was gone.

Now, then turn up in some other place. 

I don't know what it is going on, I am turning to you, Reddit. Does anyone have any idea what is going on? Am I just losing it?

I was sixteen or seventeen at the time and my relationship with Leighanna had grown to the point our parents didn't mind if we shared a bed. More often than not I spent the night at her house because her mom was far more lenient than my parents. For obvious reasons I took full advantage of this and spent several nights with her.

She and her little brother had told me several times of the strange and terrifying things they had experienced here

We were asleep together in her room when I was woken up by the sound of scratching. In my addled state I assumed a rodent or something of similar size had gotten in her wall. Naturally I got up

I got back into bed and not a moment after the air had escaped the blanket did I hear the scratching again. Being young and fueled by testosterone

In the dream, I specifically remembered the seating arrangement. It was a small four person table and on one side was sitting my mom, and then me next to her, with my stepdad sitting opposite my mom and my sister sitting next to him, opposite me. Were were talking about dream gibberish but I specifically remember my mom all of a sudden talking about peanut butter. Weird.

Anyway, but they want to have thai food, which I had never even had before. They want to go to a restaurant called Bangkok West which I had also never gone to before. So we get to the restaurant, and my sister, being a teenage girl, has to call one of her friends about some bullshit, so she stays outside in the parking lot to do so. My stepdad gets caught up in a business call or something and so he does the same, so I do. It didn't feel like a *weird* desire to do so, across from me. 

At this point, chatting the way you would when just sitting down at the table. My mom starts talking about other thai restaurants she's been to before. And then she starts talking about peanut butter. About how one time in a thai restaurant she saw a cabinet in the kitchen stocked with jars of skippy peanut butter. And then I realize the familiarity of everything. From what I remember from the dream, my mom had been talking about skippy peanut butter. And the restaurant was decorated wall to wall with golden statues of Buddha and that sort of thing. And the seating arrangements were exact. It blew my mind how accurate, down to every detail everything was--the decoration of the restaurant, the seating arrangements (and my weird compulsion to sit next to my mom), and my mom talking about skippy peanut butter.

The first thing experienced was the other day my girlfriend came home to find her toothbrush and toothbrush holder laying on the bathroom floor about four feet from the sink. No one had been in or out of the house since I left with the kids that morning. I was the last one in the bathroom and the items were on the sink when I left.

Yesterday morning I woke up (I was the only one awake) went downstairs to use the bathroom after I did so I returned to our bedroom to get ready for work. I went back down approximately 10 minutes later (still the only person awake) and walked into the bathroom to find a small bottle of shampoo sitting vertical in the middle of the floor.

Last night we had all gone to our old place to clean up and returned later that night. My girlfriends son went into the front room where the front door and it was open and unlocked. My girlfriend and I know for a fact that it was locked and closed when we left since we are security freaks. The other odd part is the screen door which you must travel through (it's an enclosed porch) was still locked. 

Other odd things include unexplained sounds (and not just house settling sounds) these including knocking

I should point out that her son is 15 and could be labeled as a troubled teen

Another interesting thing is the house was rented to us at a to-good-to-be-true price and the previous tenant moved out three months prior to the end of their lease yet continued to pay rent but also refused to come back and get belongings. Our landlords also asked us about five or six times on whether we were positive that we wanted the place with almost apprehension in their voices.

If these kinds of things are already taking place only a week into our new lives there I am very curious as to what may happen in the coming months. What more should I expect to have happen? Should I have a paranormal group come investigate? Or should I just enjoy living in a haunted house?

I moved into these apartments right after this horrible event happened, July 30th.

When we first came here, so we asked if there was a better unit available and she showed us what is now our apartment. When we said we would take it, she was almost shocked, it was strange enough for me to remember how she acted when we said we wanted this unit, the condition and space is 100 x's better than the other one so her reaction was very odd. I'm not sure if Quietens mother (Quentin is the guy that was murdered) where he was going before he was murdered lived here, or if this was one of his friends or family members apartments or anything, but I've had a list of very strange experiences in this area and recently

These are 2 one of the many articles, including the results from the criminal trial against the murderer. The other one does also if you would prefer a quick read, if you have the time please read both.

**Articles:**

*Quick.*

*Full story from my towns paper.*

http://www.thereporter.com/ci_22439653/jury-weighs-mans-fate-vacaville-murder-trial

The recent events I've experienced are quite strange and extremely telling, and a list of them since we moved in to this complex.

I'm going to start with the one that really stood out to me and the store clerk

It was very late at night, literally right across the street. I walked into the store and went to the corner wall near the bathroom where they keep what I needed, it's the only spot in the store that has an ""odd"" feeling, I'm not quite sure how to describe it other than when I walked over there I could feel the environment change.

So I take my stuff up to the counter and all the sudden I see a white cloud figure rush from the wall I just described, then I said, ""wow did you just see that?!"" it took her a second to determine if I was nuts or heavily drunk, which I was not, so when she said ""no, what?"" I said ok, I'm not drunk or crazy, you sure you didn't see anything?""

She said ""nooo don't say that I see shit all the time"" (whatever that means) she walked a few feet and took a breath, 2 am in the morning, no pun intended but it was a ""Ghost Town"" like night, totally silent around our area.

This was one of the most obvious apparitions I have ever seen in my life, but never saw anything with my own eyes like I had just seen.


Let me take you back for a second, this is how I came across the story of the guy that was murdered in my complex. I have had experiences in my unit, which led to me actually set up my webcam on the hallway while I walk to the store, I've only done this twice so far and I caught something on audio falling down from somewhere, which is probably why I stopped setting it up as I kind of just didn't want to know if it got worse. I will see if I still have it, the audio on the net-book I used was really bad but the object falling was very apparent, almost like a loud clapping sound. I may of deleted it due to how bad the recording sounded but I will post edit to update and post if still available. Most experiences happen outside of my unit, the next experience

My computer and desk face a wall and at night I'm able to see shadows of people that walk by due to the streetlight shining through my window, as if they were running very VERY fast, every time I see these shadows I immediately look out my window and never once find anything. The only ones I find are the slow moving people walking to their vehicles, never have I see the objects that rush by.

Last week my dad was outside, she sits in her car until it's time to do her rounds) I never asked what he meant until I had this experience I'm about to explain.

I was sitting at the computer and I saw one of the shadows go past, she was slowly walking down the path, something just seemed off about how she was walking so I continued to watch her..

I've made a diagram of our whole area and her path so you can understand what I'm talking about. Sorry for the sloppiness

**Diagram**
http://i.imgur.com/jjswxJT.png

I saw the shadow where I've written **HER START** she then walked very.. what I can only describe as ""oddly and control like"" she then walked straight over to the front door of **UNIT #2** stood there not moving an inch, I need to know"" she LITERALLY at the same time my last word ended, turned around, and stared RIGHT at me through my window, all the lights off in my house, no WAY she could have known I was peeking through the blinds. She then proceeded to the **WINDOW** of **UNIT #3** walked right up to the corner of it, stood there for around 10 seconds and walked behind the unit, she just stood right next to it, then slowly over to a window and doing the same thing

I then went back to ask my dad, and explained to him I had seen her doing the same exact thing just now, she was moving like a robot, very strange behavior.""


Those are the latest experiences

There are after very loud bangs and noises outside of my unit, nothing. I'm an extremely observant person, someone could walk behind me while i'm blindfolded with headphones on and I would still know, nothing goes unnoticed by me around here. The car alarms go off every other night for no reason, sometimes 10 min straight until someone notices. (in my conclusion you'll see why all of this is important)

I've seen other people act like our security guard, right out in the middle of the parking lot, for 10 minutes, turn and walk off the same way out guard did. Another time I saw a man walking towards the other path in the diagram screaming at the top of his lugs ""AHHHHHH!!"" *5 second pause* ""AHHHHHH!!"" *5 second pause* ""AHHHHH!!!"" then RUN off as fast as he could screaming until his voice faded away as his vocal cords reach maximum throat breaking level towards around the back of my unit. This was a few months after the murder, maybe 5 max.

At least 5 times a month ambulances come here, before that a young girl was screaming at the top of her lungs and had to be restrained on the gurney as she was put into the back of the ambulance, screaming and trying to get away for her life it seemed.


Those are the ones that stick out the most, 27 year old tough as nails California guy, real thick skin. I woke up and my stomach was in shambles, the fear in my stomach I felt was extremely intense. I get a feeling of ""let me get your attention from these."" One experience that happened recently not sure if paranormal at all, but will mention. I was walking home from the store, a very old lady was trying to cross the street so I ran over there and helped her cross. The next day walking back in the middle of the day on a well trafficked path to the store I found $13 at the exact point I started to run to the lady from, right in front of the store I saw the apparition at. Haven't seen the lady since, and at the same place? strange.


**Conclusion:**

Now this is the most important part. First I need to tell you that I have left some experiences out to cut down space and not confuse you, like you're walking through webs but there are non. Just a TON of things like this, so I've chosen some of the experiences that are ""well up there"" and down right just not normal in general. 

I always have a skeptic side when something happens 50% Skeptic and 50% Experience. I work on an even level with both cylinders operating when what I believe to be an a paranormal or strange experience of any kind, I believe I'm **legitimately** being asked for attention from Quentin, or someone else telling me I can help him. It may even be others around here also but I may be the one that can help the most and he can sense it. I just don't want anyone thinking I'm ""seeing things"" or he's ""believing what his mind is interpreting to his eyes."" If the apparition sighting at the gas station was in the same direction the clerk was facing she may of seen it if it wasn't only for me to see, but the cash register was facing the door while I was facing in the direction of the wall and register.

July 30th is coming up, him showing me his light, feeling trapped in a corner and wanting to escape, hence the fast running motion I saw of the apparition in the corner, white symbolizing his good heart and intentions. Could he be trying to communicate with me? due to the fact I may be the only person in this area with a ""knowing and interest"" in the paranormal. 

I'm sorry but, is there a substitute? locally available at a grocery store maybe? I went out there once a few years ago to check it out, they have a lot of healing stuff, I went for white sage to do around my home just as an experience, 3 years ago, I wasn't THAT into the paranormal as I am now you could say. On his anniversary should I sit on the bench across from our apartments and do some kind of cleansing? I need to know how to protect myself also. It's about 50 feet from his murder.

I'm 26, so I feel this is another reason he may be trying to grab my attention as we kind of came from a similar lifestyle at one point and are around the same age.

I know this was long but I can't hold all this in, wondering why no one will give him any attention. 

If you made it this far I really thank you for reading

Thanks everyone.


**UPDATE**

So after writing this I left to go do some work on my dad's friends car

I came back into the house and my air conditioning was changed from Cool to Auto, RIGHT before I walked out the door I took it down to 68, put it on Cool and walked out the door, I specifically remember checking the temp and changing it from the 70's where my dad likes it to 68, he walked out the door first after I changed it and I locked the door behind us, I come back and the whole thing is just wrong you would have to hit multiple buttons for this to happen, a sequence. I walk into the kitchen and our stand up mirror is laying on the ground on top of the lunchbox I had it propped up on for height. This is getting bizarre

 Fast forward about two months, but when I'm showering and Zach comes in the bathroom, I always feel a breeze before I actually see him). I pull the curtain, happy that he was home early, but there was no one there. I stood there for a moment shocked, because I felt and saw him/someone come in. I grabbed my towel and walked through the house. No one. I called Zach at work and he picked up the phone. He was sympathetic to my fear, but thought I was just being silly.

Now, but he never leaves my side. As it gets dark outside, he gets more insistent about staying with me and gets more skiddish around the door to the extra bedroom. Last night, I felt that heavy presence and looked at Bam. He had his back to me, standing between me and something. He was poised to pounce. Not growling really, but non-verbally asserting himself.. towards the extra bedroom. Obviously there was nothing there. I slammed the door to the extra room and took Bam for a walk.

1369242930.0,1euffh,[Experience] Strange camping trip,Zanki,40,16,17,"When I was 14 I went camping in the summer with the girl guides. We only traveled a few miles away to a place we had visited a few times for game nights. Each year

We where staying on the large estate near the woods, we built a climbing frame, lit candles in the dark and pretended we had landed on an alien planet (a silly fun game, it is part of the story later). 

The next morning, so we ventured into the woods on our own. We where joking around, grabbing wood as we walked. We ended up at the obstacle course and decided to play on it for a while, even though it was out of bounds. When we were done, we grabbed the firewood and started walking back to camp. The woods, to me, they felt and looked strange. It was as if the place was slightly different. I decided to start trying to scare the girl I was with, trying to spook her because it was fun. She got spooked and ran off and left me behind. I wasn't bothered as I slowly walked back, he was wearing a white T-shirt and a cap, everything goes back to normal

So I don't say anything more, sing songs and just have fun. On the second to last day, we play a game. We had landed on the alien planet and once we had breakfast, we had to go hide in the woods, build a shelter, a fire to make food and people had to go steal food from the campsite without being seen. I am left in the woods on my own for ages as the other girls go about getting the food. I build a pretty awesome shelter, but I realised I needed my pen knife which I had left in my tent, terrified. I eventually get the story out of them. They had been making their food when a man

That night was the camp fire. As it ended, but she won't tell us what she saw. 

The last day, I was in a ghost hunting mood. So me and two other girls go into the woods. I'm in the lead and I'm walking along a path. I stopped walking and hear footsteps in front of us. Clear footsteps walking on dead leaves, but there where none. No one was walking anywhere near us. I followed the sounds along a path, someone had heavy boots on, it was so strange. We all had trainers on. The girls I was with were silent, they could hear it as well. I followed the sounds around to a clearing at the very edge of the woods were it stopped. I decide to sit down on the grass, the other girls followed me, can you give me a sign"" routine. As I finished, before saying ""thank you"". As I said this

That was the last of the strange stuff for that camp. We had to finish packing up and left the camp that afternoon. I've been back a few times since and nothing strange has happened

A few years ago

Shortly after we moved in we starting hearing things. The ""living room"" area was right up against the stairwell leading to our apartment. Often when we were sitting in there, and start up the stairs. They would walk right up to the door of our apartment and the footsteps would just go away. This happened every day, most often early in the morning but at all hours. Many times I'd be laying in my bed with my girlfriend and the sound would wake her up. I went and checked a few times and there was never anybody there. One I heard what sounded like a man say ""hey,"" like from the top of the stairs and into the apartment. No one was there. Many people heard this and we eventually started to joke about the ghost. The door at the top of the stairs led into the kitchen, and another thing that happened a few times was that you would hear the person coming up the steps, the sound would go away, and then things would start falling in the kitchen.

The incident I'm wondering about happened only one time but I remember it clearly. My cousin always woke up earlier than I did to go to work. The door into the stairwell didn't close properly and would remain open unless you forced it shut. I woke up one morning and went to drain the lizard. As I walked into the kitchen(the bathroom was off the kitchen), through the kitchen, and out into the stairwell without even looking at me or acknowledging me in any way. My only thought at the time was ""great, my cousin left the door open and now there's a dog in the apartment."" I went to pee, listening to see if the dog would walk down the stairs. Didn't hear anything. Finished, went out to find the dog. It was gone. There was no where it could have gone but down the stairs. And let me be clear, this is a pretty small, really creepy. I just got back into bed and didn't tell my girlfriend because she would've been freaked out.

Anyone ever seen anything like this before or heard of it happening?

sort of abandoned area and next to it a railway track
My parents had moved to this location newly, my elder sister, she was four yo and I was one.
My mom was not having a job at that time and staying home taking care of us kids. 

This was the very first night at that new house. So at night around nine my dad left for work, but was closed. 

After some time she starts hearing this paper shuffling type of sound from other side or the window. And smell of kerosene. This sound continued long into the night and she couldn't sleep and was scared.Somehow she made it through the night and next day morning she straightaway went to the house owner who stayed in the neighboring house and asked and told about her experience the previous night.

The guy told the people who stayed there earlier had experienced similar events and that his wife had committed suicide in that house couple of years ago using paper and kerosene to burn herself to death. It seems the husband was out on the street when this happened and ran inside when he heard the screams and tried to save her from the fire. but it was too late and she died.

 There was an archaeological dig at the house a few years back and the house was built on top of a mass grave for British revolutionary war soldiers. The Brits were killed in 1779 and buried in a mass grave. We are told to explain that the father of the original owner of the house killed one with a cannonball. Well after this i did a little research and found the marines were founded in 1775. The marines and the Brits were at war when the British soldier died.

1323266905.0,n3wol,Finally saying something 2 years after it happened.,VirtualAnarchy,29,2,35,"Well. I don't have any fancy dialogue

* Since age 8

* At age 9 (I had managed to ignore the eerie feeling I had) I was sleeping in my room, and she said I had probably left it open. I knew I hadn't, but I figured it would be a one time occurrence. Days pass and it happens again. I wake up to find it open. In the middle of the night as well. It's as if whatever was doing it was toying with me. Me, being scared, crept to sleep in my younger brother's room where I felt safe. 

* At age 10, the doll was more that 2 feet away from where it originally was. I still can't forget that. Something was trying to hurt me. 

* Months pass and I work up the courage to sleep in my own room, but decide to sleep with my lights on. I go to sleep. When I wake up in the middle of the night, I hear something slam. I looked to see what it was and one of my model planes I had was broken into several pieces on the floor. Not only was I shitting bricks, I was pissed off. I have no doubt in my mind it liked that. Determined, I slept in the room one more night, but had my parents check the closet (that's where I thought the monster was) and there was nothing. I figured it had left because I slept good that night. 

* I slowly built up confidence to face the monster, etc.) but actually I was the scared one. A few nights later I wake up in the middle of the night (that's usually when shit went down) and I knew something was up. I had lost all the bravado in me and all of my skin color when I look above my covers to see an eye. A fucking eye. My closet was cracked open maybe 3 centimeters on the right side, and on the lower portion there was an eye. Just looking at me. I wanted to scream, but I waited for something to happen. I thought I was crazy. Just as I was thinking this, the eye went from looking at me over to the left side of my room. It just stared at a small table I had there. After what felt like an eternity the eye just vanished. Now I knew I was crazy. I never told anyone because I didn't want them to think I was a nut, so from then until 6-7 months after this I would sleep in my brothers room so we could 'save money on our energy bill'. My parents didn't mind. 

* After that incident shit started to get worse. I was alone at my house. My brother was in karate and my sister was in ballet. I never had a fear of being alone in my house

* 2 months pass and I get relatively comfortable staying alone at the house. Again, when all of a sudden books from the near-by shelf. They just fall flat on the floor. Unprovoked. I couldn't move. I was in shock. I called my mom as fast as I could and told her to help me. She was getting annoyed of this happening but came home anyway and said that it was just a one time thing. The books could have fallen because they weren't steady. I was getting annoyed with my mom, because she didn't believe that something was targeting me. So I stopped telling her weird things that happened to me, but not much else did until I was 14. 

* This scarred me for life. I was in my bed, I started singing [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TsfShR5ZY). I don't know why, and those of you who want to laugh can, but it's what I did. I started singing it louder and louder and then I stopped remembering things. Our maid said she heard me singing and came in my room to see of I was alright. She said we had a normal conversation and I said I needed to get my sleep. The last thing I remember I quickly turned on my side and I could not move. I remember the last thought I had was the words 'you wouldn't'. I couldn't move my arms, legs, hands, feet. Nothing. Then the bed started shaking. That thing I had been fearing finally attacked. And then it all stopped. I could move again, that thought had always been in the back of our minds) and they quickly got their Bibles and started to pray over me. I don't remember what happened after that. But I came to and my dad was standing up and tears were pouring out of my mothers eyes. I asked them what was wrong and what happened

* TL;DR: There is none. It's all pretty important.

I'm very new to reddit but thought this might be an interesting read for the paranormal addicts like myself.  About 5 years ago, it was as if someone was right by my ear struggling to breath and just about choking.  I freaked out and turned the light back on but no one was there.  Since people always ask - I was not drunk or stoned or anything like that.  I turned the light off again and it happened again.  I jumped off that bunk bed so fast and ran to sleep in another room.  The next morning I told the RA what had happened and he told me it had happened to students in the past as well.  There was a rumor that Sophie died from tuberculosis when she was 19 which would make all of the sense in the world seeing as you basically choke to death with that disease.  I've had small weird things happen to me since but nothing as unexplainable as this.  ",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,

So almost every night at 3-3:30am I wake up. Complete silence except the air conditioner and fan. I put my headphones on and watch some ASMR videos on YouTube and try to go back to sleep. But some nights I'm awoken by a touch. It could be on my leg, I felt someone rubbing my leg really slow then it stopped, then it sat right next to me on the bed. You could feel the weight drop down and everything, that's when I sat up and looked around. The weight never left. But somehow it wasn't there anymore. 

There's been other times when this happens in the middle of the day. One time I was laying down messing with my phone and something licked my leg by my ankle. But it didn't feel like a normal tongue
up and checked my ankle and it was dry. But I totally felt it get licked. My friend told me there's entity's that take form as a Dog and that those are most likely demons.

A little background: My husband and I moved into our apartment about a year ago. The building is about 100 years old and on a main street downtown. I reaserched my block and what I found was that in the early 1900s, the house was torn down (says an article). After a murder took place, the house was torn down and the lot was built (says the guy who tore it down). In my apartment, an older lady with multiple health problems died after having a heart attack and being taken to the hospital. 
Outside my door, and a guy lives on the end nearest the parking lot. Peroidically, I hear running (like children) in my breezeway and several times I have opened the door and no one has been there or anywhere near. After asking the guy at the end who runs around up here, he told me its no one; he hears it, but when he looks, there's no one there (at this point, I hadn't told him I had looked before and saw no one). My kitchen cabinets open and close on their own, I was laying in bed and something patted my shoulder.  
Whatever this is seems to be somewhat friendly and I've adopted the philosophy that as long as it leaves me alone, but it always comes back. I feel like it's a child, a woman, or both. My husband thinks I'm a nut; he's a huge skeptic.

Well after looking at some posts I figured I'd share a story of something that happened when I was 18 and my family and I moved into a new house.  I apologize in advance for the long post.

We had moved into this house about 3 months before the incident.  Our family consisted of myself, and my sister (7).  The house is a single story with 4 bedrooms, 2 on 1 side, the master bedroom and a small room next to it which belonged to me.  On the other side of the house were the other 2 rooms and in between was the living room kitchen an office area and the laundry room.  My room was in the front left side and my little sisters was in the back right.  Sorry about the detail just feels needed.  Now to the actual story lol.

It was 3:09 one night and everyone was sound asleep when I'm woken up but a little girls voice faintly saying ""Mooooom"".  It wasn't a quick 'Mom' like people usually say but the way someone would say it when calling for someone in the distance or one they can't find.  I roll over and look at my clock and sit up my bed wondering if I had heard what I thought I heard.  Maybe it was just a dream that I was having and surely If I waited I would hear either my sister calling for my Mom or nothing and I would go back to sleep knowing it was a dream.  I sat there listening for a few minutes and after hearing nothing I laid back down.  Within 30 seconds of me closing my eyes I hear ""MOOOOM are you there?, made up name, just call for me.  My jaw dropped! ""You heard it too?"" I asked her.  Yea she called for me twice I was getting dressed to go check on her she said.  I told my mom that I had just come from her room I had heard the same thing but Lucy is sound asleep!  Without saying a word we both knew what we had just heard, we looked at each other and I watched her cautiously, best word I can think of, make her way back to her room looking around.  I slowly made my way back to bed and didn't hear anything else.

Two months later we were driving down a back road that we had never drove on because our neighborhood had just connected to it giving it 2 entrances so we thought we see what was back that way.  We turned out of our neighborhood and about a mile down the road we see a plaque, 'In 1702 a massacre of the Apalachee Indians happened on this site.  Men, Women and Children were slain without remorse.  We hope that they find peace in the after life that was unreachable on this planet.

He heard an unfamiliar cell phone ring, which he assumed was coming from the tv. He thought it strange that the news anchor seemed to be unbothered by it. The station went to a commercial break, and the ringing continued. Convinced that it must be his own cell phone, my dad walked into the kitchen to answer it. His phone was not ringing, and there were no missed calls. On his way back into the living room, and I turned it off when I was done looking at it. #3: even if I hadn't turned it off

My earliest encounter with the paranormal happened when I was around seven years old. At the time I was living in a waterfront home that was built in the 1950s. Like most old homes it would creak

I was a superstitious and meticulous seven year old. I had a regimen before going to bed. Al the lights would be on

On one particular night I saw what could only be described as a black silhouette in my room. For no apparent reason I woke up in the middle of the night and shot up into a sitting position. In front of me at the base of my bed was a black figure. It was a two-dimensional silhouette of a man. It was not transparent but simply black and around the edges everything was distorted (almost wavy). I wanted to scream yet I could do nothing. I sat there paralyzed and that's all I remember. I don't even remember going back to bed. In fact

**Second experience**


The second time I had an encounter with the paranormal was when I was attending university. I was living in a townhouse with two other friends. From the moment I moved in I felt this feeling of dread. It was so unsettling living there. There was this aura of evil that permeated throughout the house no matter where you were. Since we were students we were cheap and decided not to buy blinds for the living room. We had two big windows facing a forest as a backyard. At night

In order to properly tell the story I need to set up the scenario. I was in my living room and the television was on. The windows facing the backyard were completely fogged due to the cold of winter and me forgetting to take the pot off the stove. I had just finished eating spaghetti and was watching my favorite show of the time

 ~~Two~~ Three most memorable:

The first one was when I was younger, and we went to hang out in the downstairs suit (not rented at the time), attached to the house. We weren't allowed to be down there. Which is why we went, of course. 
Before her parents came home we came back upstairs to continue to play and hang
Her parents came an hour or so later, and they then asked us how it became such a mess? We went and looked and it looked like someone had thrown a party. We said at some point we thought we heard someone down there, and her parents investigated, nothing was stolen, the doors and windows locked. It was weird. They grounded us anyway

**TL;DR - Played downstairs at a friends place, yelled at us for making a disaster, we had nothing to do with it**

My boyfriend, knowing he would eventually pass it on to his daughter. His heart and soul.

At the time

The friend who was living there

That night at dinner, it's haunted."" He went on to tell us about things flying at people who disrespected the house and lights going on and off at their own will. Other things that spook you. I thought David was pulling our legs, as he has a tendency to do so. As he finished his tales, and the four of us were rolling cigarettes to go outside for a smoke, there were distinct footsteps from the stairs before us. We all looked, saw nothing. David laughed, said ""I told you."" And the rest of us gave our fair shares of ""what the fucks?!?!?!"" and nervous laughter.
We returned
David informed my boyfriend and I that we had chosen the old mans room
My boyfriend and I were kept awake most of the night with the sounds of shuffling papers a scuffling. Rats

The next morning my boyfriend and I slept in. As we were lying in bed trying to laugh off the night before, to an empty house. 
The boys showed up an hour later, but nothing as notable as those.

**TL;DR - Visiting a friend out in the woods, lights, rummaging, and coughing happened**



Yeah

A lot of disconnected things would happen.

In the younger years, small people sitting in my grandpas room, which was also the computer room. Where most of the creepy shit would happen. They wouldn't stick around long, I'd get a glimps, have time to register what I saw, and then they'd be gone. I never felt threatened.

Things in my granpa's room would often just fall off of things, I'd straighten the bed out to see if the impression would be there later. They usually were. This also didn't really scare me, it seemed like a game.

One time in particular in my grandpas room I was on the computer playing dress-up dolls. Don't know if you young girls ever played thoughs, rather loudly said something like ""Do you have to play that again?"" It freaked me out, and i refreshed the page to see if it would do it again, thinking it was something that happened when you logged on. It didn't happen again, and I checked the speakers, which were turned low. I left the room, the only time I felt really spooked. Perhaps because I was a little older.

The lights in my room would inexplicably be turned on when I'd wake up in the middle of the night. I used to get mad at my grandparents thinking they checked on me and would forget to turn off the light. After numourous times of them saying they hadn't even checked on me

My grandma went to Scotland once, I heard the drawers in the kitchen open and slam, the distinct noise of the cutlery. And then the cubboards doing the same. I ran to my grandpa's room (right next to mine) and it took me a long fucking time to rouse him from his sleep, which was another unusual thing. He investigated, nothing out of sorts, of course.

When I was fourteen or fifteen I was having a sleepover with one of my friends. We decided to sleep in the old wicker sleigh bed upstairs over the garage

My friend had a boyfriend who was a very...weird character. Seriously strange. A teenage punk rocker with serious Jewish pride. (Not that him being Jewish is all that relevant

We decided to call him up because we liked putting him on speaker phone. He'd always stop mid-conversation to go, ""No, no, it's someone else."" The someone else would, supposedly, be a dead person.

So we were chatting with him when he did his characteristic pause and said, and that it was hers. And that she liked us being up there because that room was rarely used (it was my mom's hobby room and the A/C was regulated separately from the rest of the house, so we really didn't use it much because it was always kept so hot). I was a little creeped out, but whatever, we spent the night and I stopped worrying so much about it. (Though every time I'd go up there afterwards, I'd talk to her, saying hello, etc. I didn't really believe in her

A few years later, my mom, and I), she suddenly froze. She said, ""You repaired the bed back there?""

The wicker had been old and coming apart

She said that the old woman really appreciated it

So, you know, become enamored with the living. :)

These experiences occurred sporadically up until I was maybe ten, which started when I had mono for a while when I was 16.

On one occurrence, I felt like I was two different people, and one was coming out of my body. I literally saw myself being pulled out of myself from the left side.

I would like to stress straight away that I am completely scientifically minded and up until this time last year I was 100% a non believer. I live with my girlfriend, she's just had experiences and is open minded about what it could be.

This time last year I was at work, she was taking sleeping tablets and anti depressants, but this ceased prior to the following incidents. I just mention it because Like I say , I am open to all explanations and want to be completely honest.

I was at work and she phoned her sister and mentioned that she felt that there was something in the house watching her. This progressed to doors slamming after her sister (who is a bit of a tool) started inviting the ""whatevethehellitis"" to show itself. (She was on loudspeaker, several things happened, but the last really spooked me. Our pet dogs and cats started reacting to something in the corner of the room under the stairs (in our front room). Growling etc. Several things were being dropped and smashed but as we didn't see the point of origin this did nothing to convince me. However at bed time, she was in bed and I was stood up on the other side of the room, and a bottle of moisturizer caught my eye. Due to the fact it was floating in the corner of the room, and as I looked at it, it dropped to the floor. That night

The next day, but she said she would be OK. She phoned me at several points in the day though, quite upset as doors were being slammed as she walked through them, and she was starting to think she was going crazy. Her other sister visited her that day, and ashtrays and heavy objects were being thrown about the room. Her sister had to leave in the end, as she has two small children and was getting worried for their safety.When I returned from work, her other sister, decided to come down with her mother in law (who dabbles in the occult) to see what was happening. This did not help. They all went up to our bedroom, it would throw a bead to them, tried to leave the room

Things just went from bad to worse over the next couple of weeks, and a wardrobe being pushed on top of her. The scariest was when she was in the bath lying down, and her legs were lifted out of the bath so that her head went under the water and I had to pull her out. 

I should also mention that just before and during this period of time, hitting herself, swearing and even trying to choke me. 

Things got so bad, when we entered the bedroom we were staying in and found a glass bead on the middle of the bed. My mother is also very sceptical of these things, but as she dropped us off and came into the house with us, she witnessed my girlfriend being scratched deeply across the face twice, as soon as she stepped through the door. As things were so bad, we got in touch with a priest to bless the house. Not much use, as while he was doing it she was being scratched. We also were in contact with a witch who sent us some oils and spells to protect and bless the house. These things did seem to help as over time the occurrences seemed to lessen though it seemed to really drain my girlfriend. 

 And for the past 6-9 months, a blue circular light with definite depth appeared momentarily in the corner of the room before flashing once and disappearing. Doors have begun to slam again and last night the weirdest and scariest thing so far happened.

Whilst asleep (her terrors are always about 15-20 mins after she falls asleep) she began to natter nonsense that sounded like Latin to me. I started to write bits of it down and when she woke up we looked at what I had written and googled a few of the words.  I wrote it all phonetically

This is a few of the phrases she kept repeating first* my phonetic* spelling

*domines vomestrom* / Dominus vobiscum / Lord be with you

*Ante morte*/ante mortem /before death

*Cynnes*/Cunnus /cunt

*Ocules infernum*/Oculus Infernus /eye of hell/fire

*Egetet provoko*/ego te provoco/ I dare you

*Copse evaile* /Corpus vile /worhtless body

*Abetad morales*/abiit ad maiores /Gone to the ancestors/died.

So yeah.  Bit weird. Some of these phrases she could of picked up subconsciously

We are willing to accept logical ideas

Please help!!!

TL;DR Girlfriend got haunted last year
She spoke Latin in her sleep last night!

Over summer break, I spent the night, and the next day her parents had to leave for work by 7:00. My mom was getting off work at around 4:00, so we decide to stay at Amandas' house until then. Her brother was at his friends' house, so we had the whole house to ourselves. At around 12:00 AM, I ran upstairs to use the restroom, and left Amanda sitting at the kitchen table. After doing my business, I heard a door softly close. Not one to jump to conclusions

At around two, but there were no cars in the driveway. There have been break-ins in her neighborhood recently, so we grabbed weapons and snuck down stairs to check it out. We looked everywhere, but there were no intruders and the house was locked up tight. 

Satisfied, and we started listening. After about fifteen seconds of sitting in silence, I started hearing whispering coming the hallway outside her room ( I know, how cliché. It really happened though.) Bewildered, we looked at each other, our expressions saying 'did you hear that?!' The whispering was very faint, but at the same time sounded almost like a stage whisper-as if someone was saying the same word or phrase over and over again. I look at her and ask if she wants to leave, and the whispering moves so it's right behind us. I push her and she starts running

After sitting in her driveway for around fifteen minutes, a similar noise came from about halfway up the stairs. We started walking to the door, shoes in hand, when we heard more whispers. At that moment, my mom pulled up and we had to leave. 

I'm going back there tomorrow night

  She had met up with some friends after working closing at her job. I vividly remember her coming in, this irrational need for her not to leave. But, I couldn't make myself get up to ask her stay. I was literally paralyzed with fear. She was life support for 3 or 4  days. It felt like weeks. I remember begging her to stay, I  wasn't ready for her to go yet. 
 
   After her subsequent passing, I moved into her room. I changed her clock from her time to actual time, and set an alarm for school the next day. After making other minor adjustments, went to take a shower. I opened the door and rush of warm air and smelled as if someone had recently taken a shower. No one had, it  was the bathroom my sister and I shared, no had taken a shower in there since the day before. While I was investigting the bathroom, the alarm in my bedroom went off. It was back on the old time. I changed it back, or even the clock changing times would happen sparodically. It eventually pettered off

  We moved to Seattle when my stepfather's duty station changed. I got married, earlier this past year not long after my second was born. When she old enough to be put on the floor to play, she would always stare at the same corner, and babble. Sometimes when she was feeding, she would stop and crane her neck backwards, and smile at nothing. My mom and I joked that she was talking to her auntie. Somehow I think my sister came back to see her two nieces that I desperately wanted her to see...

The color was also the same. Her husband, a non-believer, actually admitted to the possibility of him seeing something as well.

Fast forward to the past week, this cat comes into his room, jumps onto his crib, walks along the edge of the crib, then jumps onto his face where he promptly freaks the f out.

1373374548.0,1hxjxe,Multiple experiences from southern Russia,ohcumgache,32,8,14,"This is going to be a long post

For a number of years I have lived in the southwestern part of Russia

A taxi driver was driving home late at night on an empty road when he noticed a white human-like shape appear on the road in front of the car. Before he could react, he noticed something unusual, the dusty car had a clean stripe approx 1 ft wide going all the way from the hood to the trunk, as if someone took a rag and dragged it across the car.


And very often I would hear stories that are just insane, which roughly translates to something living (or attached) to a home. And this was indeed a common belief. Even some traditions and superstitions exist that people perform when they move into a new home, whether or not they want this entity to move along with them. Most commonly, it is known as a peaceful playful entity, however some stories - even though they might be different phenomenas entirely - are far from being peaceful. One story I recall is of a family witnessing a black shadow flying around the room, not being able to see what creates the shadow. Often it would leave feces on the floor all over the house. You could look on the rug, move your eyes away for a second and there will be a pile of crap (pardon my french) sitting in the same spot. And they could not attribute it to any animal as they had no animals in the house. Other reports show classic poltergeist activity.

We ourselves lived in a big three level home

Once, I was sitting at my computer. My room was set up so that I was facing the room, I couldn't stand facing the wall with the whole room behind me. Straight ahead across the room from me was the door and I could see a part of the hallway, so all it takes for me to see the door and the hallway is to move my eyes slightly away from the monitor. It was very quiet in the house, no one else was home, TV wasn't on, nothing else was going on. As I was minding my own business, I saw something in the hallway. I move my eyes and I see a bottom of a plastic bottle (that I cut off the bottle earlier for whatever reason and kept on a desk in my room) flying on a parabolic trajectory into the room and falling onto the floor

We did have a cat, I knew every sound that the house made, I could identify who was walking the stairs (my mom, dad, brother), and the direction they were going just by the sound the stairs made. The floors in the hallway also made a distinct noise, and if the cat was playing there I would have definitely heard it before or after the event. And if something the cat plays with jumps out of its paws, making more noise. Again

Very frequently when coming home, as if the TV was on but quiet enough so you can't distinguish what was being said.

This memory is almost burned into my brain, because I can't think of a reasonable explanation. For some reason, this makes me really emotional when I think about it, so I'll try not to ramble.
I was about 16 or 17 at the time, to the point where you adjust to the darkness, and you can still see things from the light coming through the blinds.
Anyways, looking towards my wall &amp; my bedroom door. I was just laying there kind of thinking, when movement caught my eye (remember, my blinds are closed, theres nothing in my room moving that can cause a moving shadow). I remember getting a bit spooked out, and putting my head under my blanket until I couldn't breathe anymore, so I pulled my blanket down, and thats when I saw something that was black. It was darker then a shadow, and it was short. I know it was short because I remember looking over and seeing that it was only slightly taller then the height of the doorknob. It was hard for my eyes to focus on it, and ..'sketchy' if that makes sense. It was flailing and swinging its arms

I remember not being *that* scared, and flicked it on, when I turned back it was gone, and I never had anything like that happen to me again.
I told my brother about it a few years after, or that I was in a weird state of being asleep or awake, but I know I wasn't.

I have lived in the same house throughout my whole life but never really noticed anything out of the ordinary except for the occasional bump in the night that most 40-50 year old houses make. The layout of the house is nothing too special

Like I said earlier

The first thing I remember actually seeing was when I was laying in bed reading one night. I noticed that I left my bathroom light on as I could see the light coming from beneath the door. Planning on turning it off after I finished with the chapter I was on

The next event has become a regular occurrence. I would be asleep and always in the early morning (anywhere from 2-3:30) I would be awaken by this sense of someone in my room so I would jolt up and at the end of my room, it would be gone. I have seen that same shadow figure several times in my room since then and usually in a similar fashion. I recently moved off to college and my sleep has gotten a lot better and I don't see anything anymore. That is until I come home to visit.

BACKSTORY (don't have to read if you don't want to, anyway. 

The two things that stick out the most were when I was about 13  I woke up to my lights turning off and my TV going static. This could most likely be debunked quickly but 13 year old me was terrified, however. 

The second thing was about the same age, if you try to open it, it will make a very loose, metal to metal clinging sound so if you shake the entire door, the door knob will shake to. But it was shaking VERY rapidly and VERY loudly, not unlike someone trying to break in to my room. This frightened me.




ANYWAY



I'm sitting on my computer, minding my own. I get up to go to the bathroom, do my business and start to leave.

As I'm barely starting to leave the HALLWAY that the bathroom is in, and I mean LOUD banging. Three bangs in rapid succession. I  ran to the living room (for some reason, don't know why I chose the living room, fight or flight I guess) and laid down head first in to the couch, thinking something had exploded.


I got up and saw that all was clear


Well that wasn't as rational as I thought. The more I walked around the house


1) If someone had broken in, I mean they were bangbangbang not even a second between each othe. 

2) The more I started thinking the more I realized the banging sounded like it was coming from the corner between the kitchen and the office/computer room we have here...That doesn't make sense. The best way for someone to break in is to break the glass of the sliding door we have in the office and walk right in. Why three loud bangs? And the only other windows we have are either WAY TO HIGH (in the office) or WAY TO SMALL (in the kitchen)

Here's a list of some of my experiences:
* When I was 8 or so, so the sky was a beautiful purple.  (It's my favorite time).  She was taking my brother inside (he was in a baby seat) and I stopped by the car to look up at the sky.  All of a sudden, I saw a bright white shape go across the sky. I could see the shape of it, and it was VERY big, so I know it wasn't a shooting star.  I kept staring at it, and another big object flew by as well.  My mom was shouting my name, and she ran over to me.  She told me that all of a sudden, just saw the objects.  Later in my life

*When I was around 11, divided by a dresser. My part on the left as you enter, their part on the right. I was watching TV on their side of the room and could hear my mom and ex step father upstairs fighting. All of a sudden, I saw a dark shape enter the room. It had the height and width of a man with very broad shoulders...but was entirely dark...like a shadow. It wasn't on the wall.  It stopped, the head turned toward me as I lay frozen. It turned back, went to my side of the room and went into my closet.  I've never been more afraid in my life.

Skip forward, quietly moaning in pain in her sleep.  I was still awake, hard to sleep in that situation, so I went to the living room to get some paper to draw on. I bent down next to her desk and heard a voice whisper in my ear, ""It's ok, go back to your room."" At first, I said, I heard my grandma sigh deeply and she started to sleep peacefully.

I'll leave you guys with one more

*When I still lived with my parents (probably 16 or 17), as I walked in, I happened to glance over at the doorway between the living room and the kitchen. I saw a man standing there with a blue button down shirt and dark hair (styled like they do on Mad Men). I glanced away, and then looked again, after realizing what I saw. When I looked back, he was gone. I ran to get my dad thinking someone was in the house. We looked in every part of the house and found NOTHING. ",,self,,

At this point, it's about 10 pm. They bombed around for a couple hours and Rick's snowmobile broke down. It was nothing abnormal, since the snowmobile was already at least 12 years old. They had left all of the needed tools back at the cottage because there was no where on the machines to keep them, and my dad couldn't possibly leave his friend in the middle of the forest. So they both hop onto the working machine, and a couple hours later, they're back at the spot where they left Rick's snowmobile.

My Grandma died in March 2011. She was the first person my entire life who really meant a lot to me, was the night she died.

My dad, I was telling myself I should just go and sit somewhere else. Once I cooled off, and was walking back into the front room, I *very clearly* hear my Grandma's voice say *something* in my right ear. I still don't know what she said, but it was definitely her. It made me feel at peace for quite a while.

Now, but when he turned around, nothing would be there. He even mentioned one night waking up for no apparent reason, and hearing her voice call his name out.

I asked him if anything 'odd' has happened somewhat subtly, in terms of ghosts, demons, etc. Anytime I told him or my Grandma about the things I've seen in my old houses, my Grandma would believe me, but my Grandpa would attempt to tell me that it was my imagination.

Anyways -- last August, about 8 AM or so, and so did my little cousin. My cousin was watching TV in the front room, and my Grandpa was making coffee in the kitchen. As he walks into the front room, my cousin asks, ""Who was that?"".

Of course, but my Grandpa went ahead and tried to show him that it could easily just be a shadow of a person walking in front of the yard, but to his surprise, they could barely even make out the shadow.

My Granda asked my cousin again what the shadow looked like, the wall the shadow walked across was where the recliner she was always sitting in, sat.

Needless to say he was my best friend and i loved him very much. I've often passed what i'm about to tell you as just my way of grieving but since coming to college its stopped and hasn't happened. 

Walking around our house is very odd for me. Its never felt the same. And i'm not one who really takes the whole ghost and paranormal thing very seriously. However i am a christian... Funny. But whats been happening is not only strange but it happens in the regular places my father was seen most.

Various times when i have walked around our house i've had to stop and look again because its been something out of the corner of my eye. Obviously i have no proof what i'm telling you. But i don't care. I just want some consolation on the issue. 

Like i said it hasn't happened at college mainly because my father has never been here. Here goes. While walking from one part of the house to another, in various places in the house. Mainly in his chair that he would always be sitting. I remember VERY well walking down the hall and walking past the chair only to stop and look back at the chair being CERTAIN somebody or something was sitting there only moments before. 

Another encounter was when i was walking up the said hallway and i walked THROUGH whatever it is in our house. I wasn't creeped out or scared but infact it felt like somebody there to calm me and protect me. I've been very comfortable with whatever it is in the house.

Next thing. I used to talk to myself a lot as a kid. Interpret that however you like. But recently i've taken to talking TO the house. However bizarre it may sound i spoke to the house while it was being very creaky and irritating. Almost instantly it stopped and everything was silent. I just took this as coincidence and left it at that. I'm probably right to. 

As for the dark spot that floats around the house i have seen it various times just 'standing' in one spot. As if its watching me. Only problem is if i turn to look directly at the 'thing' once i've noticed it being there

So r/paranormal. Can you tell me your thoughts on this? Is there something living in our house? Could God (if you believe that or not) have sent my father to 'visit' or is it something bad that i should actually be scared of? As i said before,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,t3_v6btr

So when my dad's real dad( we will call him Ray) died of cancer in the 1970's the clock sitting above the piano in the house stopped. He died in the middle of the night. He had to use the bathroom and when my grandma helped him out of bed his skin was cold. He didn't say anything and a few minutes later he passed away. Anyways... yeah the clock died at the time of his death. 
 
 Another oddity is that the man( we will call him Hank) that she got remarried to passed away last year and he passed in the morning. He was a big guy and had one of those electric recliner lay-z-boys that has the remote to go up or all the way back in a reclining position. Well  the chair was working perfectly fine. Then he passed away and it went down to a normal sitting position and didn't work anymore.( someone used the remote it didn't do it by itself). Anyways. My son(his great grandson, he was not a big eater, but the last meal he had he asked for his favorite(fried Chicken) and ate a lot, then he would almost stare longingly at my grandma like he knew he wasn't gonna see her for very much longer.
  
 Well about a month before my grandpa passed away. My son started being bothered(or haunted) by a "" big scary man with long spaghetti hair( we only eat angel hair pasta so I am guessing string blonde hair) claws and no lips. Like a Zombie"" he has a very good vocabulary. The thing would come out of his wall and try to touch his head or bite him. It got to the point where my son would not go near his room at all. The about a week after my grandpa's death. We found my son playing in his room. He told us grandpa Hank came and told the scary man to leave him alone. After that we would hear my son laughing and talking in his room like he would talk to my grandpa. Also my newborn would lay in the room in his crib and would stare at a certain spot and smile and coo. 
We live in a small 800 sq.Ft. apartment. and along with the scary man

  So I guess I am looking for answers or sources to look at as to:
1) why do things stop when someone dies?
2)  Do people subconsciously know they are going to die? or about to?
3) What the hell was in my sons room. Any ideas please tell me. and...

I was just about to get up and grab a snack when I heard the exact noise that my mom described the day before. It sounded as if from across the living room

I didn't think much of it being paranormal because it could have been just some freak occurence that happened to me and my mom...

EDIT: I forgot to include this: My mom was upstairs by herself while me and everyone else in the house was downstairs. We all heard this very loud slam like someone just slammed their door shut. It clearly came from upstairs. Worried

Last night is where it really stuck in my mind that it might be paranormal. I just got back to my room from eating a snack and it was about 1-3 AM ish, right under my window, which is a bit creaky, but it opens pretty smoothly. Anyway, I got back into my room, sat down on my bed, grabbed my laptop and started watching some youtube videos. I paused the video to open up another tab and I heard the creepiest thing I have ever heard in my life.

The gate right underneath my window creaked open slowly and it was very, but I heard it clear as day.

I looked out my window and there was nothing there

The worst part is that earlier in the day, and checking multiple times that It was actually shut and wouldn't open. 

I will keep this updated with any other things that happen around my house. (This is not one of those made up stories you see on here



EDIT: Some people are saying that it could be wind or an animal that pushed my gate open. Here are three pictures that I think should prove that wrong.

The last few months, the day I was about to go out of town and visit a friend, part of my ceiling tile in the hallway collapsed and woke me up at about 3 in the morning. Needless to say, I canceled the trip to take care of that.

Last month, then took care of it later (again, it was a workday - I didn't have time to stop and sweep up glass).

This morning, something unmistakable as a window breaking. I rushed out to the living room and sure enough, one of my windows looks like someone took a bat to it. 

Note: my house is in a small town

Back to the window. Knowing that, it dawned on me: there's a screen on the outside of the windows, and the screen wasn't damaged.

Back inside and I took another look at the window. A closer look. The window was broken from the inside. No shattered glass

My ex-wife picked out the house. She seemed happy,"" and the very nice couple selling house immediately broke in with, ""deaths that weren't by natural causes. No, there weren't any."" 

Ok, I had zero belief in ghosts or anything supernatural, so it crossed my mind that maybe grandma or grandpa died there, but who cares?

Six weeks after we close on the house, etc. Divorce ensued. We only put 3% down on the house because at the time they were handing out mortgages like candy, so there wasn't enough equity to sell without losing at least $10k. I was left living alone in suburbia in a four bedroom house with no furniture and a black labrador retriever.

Because the house was empty

The first strange event occurred about four months in. I threw the ball and instead of coming right back with it, but then nervously looking up and backing up, then barking at the air. Even with me there, I could not coax him to walk into the middle of that kitchen and get the ball. I picked it up, walked out of the room and attempted to repeat the experiment.

Sure enough

I picked the ball up and we tried it again. This time

I laughed off the incident.

The next weird thing to happen was also in the kitchen. I was washing dishes by hand because living alone, ""That's kind of eerie but easily explained since the dishes are wet, and they're essentially just hydroplaning."" 

Then came the touching.

I had an elliptical trainer, working out shirtless is cheesy, but I live alone, so it was less laundry. I'd often just run on it in flip flops and boxer briefs. I would have just used it barefoot, but the foot areas had texture that hurt my feet. Anyway, the only part that matters is that I was shirtless.) I'm running along. I'm probably about 15 minutes into the 20-minute program, and someone puts their hand on my back.

I live alone, I flipped around fast and almost ate shit jumping off that elliptical. Nobody there. My heart is racing, but I assess the situation and get back on the elliptical to finish out the set. I run another two or three minutes, and it happens again. 

Once again, screw it, that's enough cardio for tonight. I also decide never to do elliptical without a shirt on again.

I get a couple guy roommates and the weird stuff stops. I've had guy roommates for almost seven of the eight years I've been in the house.

Then I get engaged. The guy roommates are still there for now

I've got two dogs now -- the lab is gone and these are smaller dogs. One, and she'll come in for a few minutes but always disappear again to that other room.

The other dog is now staring and barking at the air.

I've had an exceedingly paranormally active day

First things first, nothing. Utter dead silence, when suddenly I hear tiny whispers from a few feet away. The voices become more distinct, and I recognize them to be female. They giggle and talk for a while, and I try my best to ignore it. I was late, and didn't have time to deal with it.

Driving to school I was panicked because I had about 8 minutes to do a 15 minute journey. However, and I hadn't misread the clock, due to my double checking in disbelief of how late I really was. (This ones more /r/Glitch but oh well.)

Everything was normal and dull at school, and were allowed to do whatever as long as there was complete silence. The teacher's not one to let someone off without a detention, so everyone was abiding by the rule. Suddenly, I heard the whispering again. Closer this time. I looked around, no one was talking, no one had moved. The same voices, it sounded like. Giggling and talking.

About ten minutes after this

I jumped at the disruption of the quiet, or some sort of entity said it. It made no sense to my thought pattern of the time.

Later on I was returning from lunch, and I was expecting to struggle with the door, considering that the winds direction should have been blowing it shut. No sooner had a laid a hand on the bar that the door swung open, gently. I walked through, and it closed just as gently behind me, rather than being slammed closed by the wind. A guy I don't know was standing in the courtyard staring at me, and asked: ""How'd you do that?"" I just shrugged, but was inwardly freaked out. (These doors are not

Lastly, and turned the light on. Still the outline of her form and the feeling she gave lingered. I was freaked out, and told my boyfriend. He said I'd described his fathers mother, who I hadn't known. Nor had I known she was passed.

Back in 2008, like the number 2 ghost, involve murder by staff at the facility.  

Essentially

The facility consisted of 4 buildings: Brice (the residence hall), and the guard shack.  I have seen two ghosts in the residence hall, the bigger of the two I share with you now.

My second visit to Old Brice was strange.  It was my first time inside the building, and our friend Chris.  I had a flashlight and a DVD camcorder.  Through the main entrance is a staircase on the right, which zig zags up to the second floor, complete with anti suicide fence at the top.  Make a left, then another left, and then a quick right, and you are in the hall that led to the children's corridor.  I had the flashlight in my left hand and camera in the right, trying to catch something.  On the left at the entrance to that room

I thought I saw something in the bathroom and shined the light that way...nothing.  Moved the camera and light

The next day, and I was right.  When the light pans to the right, a blue-ish white, illuminated little girl's face peers out from behind the door to follow the light.  As the light shines back in her direction, over the course of two frames, she is half behind the door, next frame she was gone.  

My heart felt like an ice cube ran through it I was in such shock.  I proceeded to show everyone I knew.  The girl's appearance was that of younger than ten, and had some apparent deformation or disorder.  I made the mistake of leaving the camera at a friend's house overnight, who apparently was not my friend, and he stole it.  

This is where it gets weirder.  Two and a half years later, spirits will follow you home.  I broke a window.  

I was laying in bed one night, and very comfortable.  Out of nowhere, this...immobilizing tingling sensation started at the tips of my toes.  I was laying on my stomach with my arms under the pillow, completely helpless as this sensation crept its way slowly up my legs, midsection, and eventually entire body over the course of about 20 seconds.  Once it covered me, I heard the whisper of a little girl, say ""I'm in your room..."". I cringed tight and for some reason said aloud

We moved into this house about 2 years ago.  But soon after

Both of us would hear what sounded like a small child running down the hallway.  Our hallway is tile

I have two small children (ages 5 and 3).  But the reason these occurrences stand out is because they happen when the kids are asleep or gone.  The voice and footsteps sound like they are from a small child.  The steps are about the same as when my 3 year old runs down the hall

The first time I realized it wasn't just me was one night after the kids had gone to sleep

I have a couple of occurrences that did not take place in the hall.  I was laying with my 5 year old daughter in her bed as she was taking a nap.  No one else was home.  Her bed is in the corner.  I was facing the wall.  Suddenly, it cast a shadow on the wall.  But when I turned over, no one was there.  Also, one night, I was alone in my room sleeping.  I woke up thinking to myself that I was cold and wanted to cover up.  My blanket was half off me though.  But before I could move, I felt almost like a tapping on my side.  My blanket slid over me.  Then I heard footsteps run away.  I looked but no one was there.

This last part was the strangest

A couple of months later

I also asked him if there was someone like the little boy who lived at my mother-in-law's house.  He said yes.  But not a little boy.  It was a man.

We rarely talk to the adults in the family about it.  And we NEVER talk about it around the kids.  Why did he know it was a kid?  That lived in the hallway?

B is 3 now and no longer mentions anything about the boy.  I don't think he sees him anymore.  Probably doesn't even remember.  He also has not seen anything else at my mother-in-law's.  The adults in the family no longer talk about it either.  There was a long time there I could not sleep.  I still won't sleep with out a light on.

It happened in 1991 when I was only 5 years old, we were really scared of monsters.  Anyways, I woke up in the middle night and glanced around my room; closet to my left, lamp ahead of me, brother to my right and then a window above him.  As I looked through the window this statue of an angel quickly approached the house, it must've been at least 8 feet tall.  I looked at it with amazement and wonder, it had long flowing robes, and held a tall staff with an open bowl at the top of it.  The entire angel looked pale like a statue but the flame in the bowl was real and flickering in the wind.  I looked at it in the eyes and the whitest light started shining out, and because of the feeling I felt comfortable enough to spread my sheets out so I could see the entire image.  Once it past over me I was still a little edgy, then I passed out completely the second my head hit my pillow.

I woke up completely under my blankets all sweaty like I was under them for a while and lift the covers from in front my face.  There it was right in front of me face to face

Here's the ""proof""

I woke up my brother.  The weird part he saw something slightly different

So

The floor is yours!

The first one involves my friend, he had a strong disdain for anything mystical or magical, and a couple of upside down crosses tattooed on his body. One night we were talking about the paranormal, about some of my family's experiences with apparitions and the long tale of my uncle's alleged alien abduction, to which he replied that he thought it was all a bunch of bullshit. ""I don't believe on none of that stuff"" he told me. ""Witches, ghosts, UFOs, all of it...all of it except shapeshifters.""
""Huh?"" I replied with a questioning tone

""Yeah

I had never heard about skinwalkers up until that very day, the shapeshifting, etc... Apparently in the mid 2000s there had been some mumblings around his town about people finding creepy shit up in the hiking trails by the mountains. I'm assuming this was in Santa Barbara because that's where he grew up, but I never asked. The murmurs around the high school were that there was some creature who had frightened some hikers past the bridge that crossed the ravine, and a couple of days later a woman on an evening jog had stumbled upon a very large coyote. Mike and his friends decided to go up into the canyons to check it out. The first trip took them all the way up to the bridge, and since it had been getting dark and they lacked flashlights, they decided to go back. They didn't see anything out of the ordinary but did notice the lack of animals in the area. The second time they took flashlights and made it past the bridge, they heard no birds, until one of his friends yelled out ""stop!"". 

Mike halted and his friend again told him. ""To the left

Mike focused the light on 2 yellow dots across the ravine that were staring back at them. Suddenly the dots started rising, grey fur. The creature was facing away from the group, but looking back at them over its shoulder. It had silvery, long fingers that came down to his hips, and contorted face features. He looked at them for a second, turning his body to reveal a plume of silver hair on its chest, and then moved into the brush without making a sound. 


The group was visibly shaken, and then trotting, and then eventually sprinting in a panic. Across the ravine, a thrashing could be heard as if a the creature was making its way through the thicket. The group kept running, and the flashlight was dropped over the bridge, shattering. They made their way back to the car, where 2 of their friends had decided to stay as they didn't want to make the hike. From the car, and a shadow was standing in the middle of it. They got the fuck out of dodge as soon as they could

The story ends here, and kept up with them up until they exited the preserve, rattling its hands against a wire fence. 




That's the first part of the tale. 

Second part picks up 2 months later. I was touring with a friend's band through the southwestern US. We had arrived in Albuquerque that night, some of the partygoers had grown up on the reservations nearby. And one of these kids had actually seen one. Intrigued, I asked him to explain what he had seen.

As a child, and he just said don't look to your right. Whatever you do, don't look to the right. He told me that he nearly shat his pants while walking, and after a couple of minutes, he gave in to his curiosity and looked back. On top of the roof of a house stood the creature, tall and skinny, shining a dull silver under the moonlight. It's long, and refused to walk alone at night for months after that.

The moment he said silver fingers, and he said he'd never met him. 

The third story involved my friend Julie. Out in San Clemente testing out her new telescope, and walked into the forest. Julie packed her shit and took off.

Experience 2: I was in my friends trailer park around midnight. We decided to walk down the street to get some fresh air. Trailer park roads run parallel to each other and are connected at the end. My friend and I made it to the end and headed on the connecting road. It was no more than 20 ft long and had no street light. We both happened to be looking down at the road as we walked.

1369831755.0,1f9k39,[Experience] In response to an earlier post 'What do Demons do when...' Here is a story.,SarcasmIsMyFont,32,10,14,"Warning: Wall of Text. 

**TLDR: a friend *might* have been possessed and here is my account and question.**

First off, I remind all everything paranormal is a theory, hypothesis or a guess. Everything else is the story. Here is my account:

I was a warm December on the west coast somewhere around 1990. My mother had attempted to raise me in a non-Baptist Baptist Church. Meaning

Fast forward through my believing years one Sunday I picked up My friend K and then went to pick up C before heading to church. Normally he was spot on ready, she simply associated Wiccan but to us then, she could've been Satan incarnate).  Cruising the empty main drag of our town at speed limit as it was a popular speed trap we started approaching downtown. We see this cute girl in her simple, yet girl next door,  church dress, light sweater, bible clutched in hand walking to church, in the back seat of my 1978 2 door Ford Futura! (Yea I was cool

K &amp; I just looked at eachother. Took me a second to realize I was driving 35mph completely distracted... Staring right as this girl was just stopped dead in her tracks scared. 

C calmly sat back in his seat put his head downward like looking at his bible in his lap and we both asked *""What the Fuck was that?!?!?"" (Good Christian response!)

C looked straight at my rear view mirror and said ""What are you talking about, and we started laughing thinking C was messing with us. Though C kind of remained quiet the rest of the ride. 

No other issues. This week at least. Next week was Winter Camp. Four days of repressed horny Christian girls running around in the sexiest ski bunny wear their conservative parents would allow them to troll potential young men of god for a lifetime of marital servitude, female dorms. About 40 yards to the west, male dorms and then south of the dorms a decent mountain side with a good snow slope. The area in the middle to the southwest was the sled runs. 

First day, that tube launched straight instead of banking left with the contoured slope and slammed a few girls between C &amp; K, the tube and the tree. Two left camp early due to injury. One in an ambulance. It's ice. It happens. Didn't happen again though. 

Next day. Boys cabin catches fire. C had laid his jacket over the heater to dry out. He had no recollection of doing so. So we shifted cabins and made room as their cabin was uninhabitable

That night, our peer leaders, stopped us, inquired and told K &amp; I to return to concert and they'd take him. Fair enough. 

Two hours the bands wrapping and a leader approaches them on the ""stage"" and whispers. The lead guy in the band says ""hey, okay! K &amp; I got worried about C so we decided to skip out. As we exited a side door, intercepted. ""Go back in!"" ... ""But we just want to check on C?"" ...

A moment later we tried another escape

We never got out but after the band's union limit was reached they wrapped, quarantine. Let's break into groups and pray. 

We did. Falling asleep praying. About what? K and I made several escape attempts, our alarms were peaked. 

Then we were finally released to cabins. At cabins told to pray for protections as we fell asleep. I still to this day can't explain the paranormal effect but out the windows of the cabins I started seeing white glowing floating orbs circling the boys cabins. Of course it was ""angels""... 

The girls reported the same the next day. 

I heard what happened. One of the pastors called up was K's father. But even among family details were scarce. It was the next Sunday a full week later church service was changed from sermon to a multiple pastor panel of reselling the accounts of the exorcism of C. It was a bone chilling account of violence, a list of the demons by name ""Deception, Lust..."" All the way to the ""Anti-Christ"" himself. Of course the hardest to expunge from his human host.

It was also the first time I realized the effort a church can go by belief and lie to thousands to use a bad night to sell God with fear to many. There were certain aspects that didn't add up. Many did. I had my own questions but their 2 hour tidy lets praise Jesus moment wasn't the answer. 

What K &amp; I knew

The inside information I had

The story

I still do. First, yea I could see it. But he would have been a god among men for such a horrific story of redemption, he'd get more pie than the rest of us. His mom likely had a stronger opinion after the medical bills. 

The only truth I can speak to, but you are still denied open access to the evidence. Be skeptical. 

I lost a friend that day because he got his ass handed to him by several trusted members of a church

It was the naming of the demons, would talk of it after. It took a few more straws for me to leave the church, technically they removed me. 

I've yet to meet a demon actively hunting paranormal. Few claims

Question everything, what was his blood toxicity the morning after?? lol 

That close

My first job was at a grocery store when I was 16. One night after we closed, ""no thanks. You need to get out now."" 

My legs wouldn't run. I just speedwalked out of there and was trembling. I couldn't believe what I just saw. I felt stupid but decided to tell the lead cashier what had happened. Her eyes got big and I thought she wouldn't believe me but I felt relieved when she said that there have been a number of customers and employees

I never experienced it again while I worked there but didn't stay much longer. I quit about two months after that. I still remember it like it just happened.

Another weird thing that happened to me occurred when I was working for an insurance company when I was 19. I was just working there part time doing data entry in the evenings while in college. Anyway

Back when I was in middle school, I was about to walk into the dark woods. I'm so glad my friend called my name because who knows what would've happened.

Sorry about typos and stuff. I have more stories but this is all for now.

Full disclosure, but I haven't seen anything online where others have had a similar experience so I thought I would try my luck here.  Have any of you experienced anything strange there?",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,

Well I was just sorting out the HDMI cable for the T.V in my bedroom. It faces away from the window so I had the blinds fully closed so I could see better. As I get the HDMI into place the blinds snap all the way back up. for something to have done that, bangs, bumps couldn't have done it. I backed away and ran for it...
