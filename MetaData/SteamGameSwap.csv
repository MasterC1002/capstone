Over the next couple days we over at Unity Gaming Network

Some of the games I will be playing on and off a lot are Chivalry, and many others (Viewers Choice?). We will also be giving away several copies of each of these games throughout the stream. We're doing giveaways based on how many people show up to the stream so the more people the more stuff we can give out.

I also have an NVIDIA GTX460 and two GTX550Ti's to giveaway as well but we need your help and support in getting the word out for this otherwise it might end up being canceled or at set back.

I really hope to see some of you there

Stream - http://www.twitch.tv/unitygn

For those only interested in winning something here

What To Do To Win Here?: 
1) Please upvote this post. I receive no Karma for a self text submission
2) Make a comment that includes your Steam ID A number between 1-1000 And which game you're interested in.* And that's it.

I will use a random number generator (random.org) to pick the winner(s) and it will be done live and recorded so you can watch it happen if so desired.

Please help spread the word about this if you like what I'm trying to do. The more people the more things I'll be able to giveaway!

I apologize for the self promotion with my stream

**EDIT** 
Wow! You guys are amazing. I **never** expected this kind of response. I feel like I should do something special for you guys but not sure if I have the money for it

I will be doing the giveaway(s) today or tomorrow. I've been so busy with the marathon and everything else going on I've barely had time to breathe

***

[*] Anyone who enters for the Double Fine bundle will automatically be entered for Psychonauts. If you already have other games in the bundle

[&amp;dagger;] There are 2 copies available - one Complete Edition and one base game. The first person to be drawn for Frozen Synapse will win the Complete Edition

***

### The Procedure:

Because managing a drawing over Reddit comments is a royal pain in the ass

In order to enter

* Go [here.][form]
* Fill out your Reddit and Steam account info.
* Pick up to *10* games that you don't already own
* Click the big ""submit"" button at the end.

***

### The Rules:

To make sure everyone gets a fair chance

You can qualify to win by **either** of these methods:

* **Method 1.** Gray flair or better on /r/SGS
* **Method 2.** A Reddit account that is at least **2 months old** _and_ has at least **300 combined karma**.
* **You don't need both!**

_Sorry

If you already own a game

Drawings will be done automatically, go yell at the guy who created Python's random number generator.

The drawing script will draw a user's name. That user then wins whatever game they want the most that's still in stock. The game they won is taken from the stock, and repeat until out of games or out of users.

The drawing will happen on **Monday

***

### The Fine Print:

_Incomplete, and you will be ineligible to win if you are listed on the Shared Ban List, are marked as a scammer by any trade site, or are trade-banned, VAC-banned, subreddit-banned, SteamRep-banned, the most recent entry will be used. Games will only be given to the Steam account listed on the submission form. Games are for your personal use only, treat

***

### The TL;DR: Click [here, profit.

Hi everyone! Celebrating my 50th confirmed trade by doing a giveaway to everyone who helped me get here. However one thing I ask before I start explaining is you will not try to trade/sell this game away if you win. I want you to either play it yourself or give it to someone. There is no way to enforce this of course but I'd like to think some people will stay true to their word.

### Welcome

First of all, and [**warheat1990**](/user/warheat1990), your new SGS moderators. They've joined us to keep a closer eye on trades, give faster responses to questions, and, most of all, get the response time for flair requests back down to a reasonable number.

That said, find your flair request, and reply to it. That will bring your request up to the top of our modmail inbox, so your request doesn't get lost in the noise.

### Registration Soon Required

### Proposed Rules Changes

With the implementation of the SteamBot registration system comes a stronger ability to permanently ban users

In particular

* **Paypal trades** would only require blue flair for the seller. Any user
* **Key trades** would be completely unrestricted. Any user could trade both Steam-tradable games and Steam-activatable keys.
* Other restrictions (accounts

Please feel free to discuss these proposals below

Note - **these are only proposals. The current rules still stand until they are changed on May 1st.**

1374951201.0,1j68lo,[PSA] How to Protect Yourself from Scammers (+ a Convenient TLDR),AtomikRadio,110,17,46,"I've been seeing a lot of PSA's about being scammed in which the OP didn't see an obvious scam coming a mile away. I just went to the FAQ and sidebar to find the ""how not to get scammed"" I'm sure I've read somewhere before but noticed only one for PayPal

**TL;DR Version:**

1. Obey the rules of the sub. Sometimes the flair may seem arbitrary but more often than not I see someone with no flair saying they were scammed in a key trade they weren't supposed to be making in the first place.
1. **Only trade with people who have identified themselves by posting in your thread.**  If someone adds you before doing so
3. Be wary of people asking you to hurry
4. Never ever trade with random adds who will not say where they added you from.
6. Knowledge is power. Ask questions, and communicate with the trader.
7. Be wary of: New Steam accounts, ridiculously cheap keys, etc.)
8. Be wary of *amazing* offers. It remains true that if something's too good to be true it probably is. Scammers will often try to overpay so that you will feel more pressure to make the trade. Is your game worth 20 dollars on Steam but they're offering you 30? Something's off.
9. **You are never required to perform a trade you are not comfortable with.** If the trader seems shady to you then move on and find a different trade partner.
10. If using PayPal be sure to read [this PayPal specific guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/rmt26/announcement_fatmanrisings_guide_on_how_to_do/) and follow it well. It's your money; be cautious and protect yourself!

----

It is unfortunate that there are scammers, likewise, you should actively defend yourself from being scammed.  The flair system here can serve as some indicator of a trader's reputation but it is not an absolute. With every trade, be it from a new trader or a 50+ flaired trader, there are signs to look out for that can keep you from being burned.

Here are some that have served me well. First and foremost:


**Anyone you are trading with from /r/SGS should post in your trade thread.**

This is necessary for trade confirmation anyways and also allows you to see their flair, but at the very least you must be extremely cautious and never go first.)

---
**Flair and Trustworthiness**

Once you have their flair you have an idea of their reputation within the community. Note that I said you have an idea. Flair is not absolute. There are lots of new but trustworthy traders just like there have been a few rare cases of higher-flaired traders going rogue. A lack of flair should prompt you to look a bit more closely but high flair does not excuse you from doing your research and covering your ass.

---
**reddit Account and Trustworthiness**

Once you have their reddit name you can look at their post history. Did they make the account recently? Are their posts only in game trading subreddits (or places like PlayItForward and RandomActsofGaming

---
**SteamID64 and Trustworthiness**

Once you have their Steam account you can look into their activities on other trading communities. Follow all of these steps:

* Look them up on [SteamRep](http://steamrep.com/). - This is *imperative* if you doubt the trader. (For a quick guide to checking a trader's SteamRep check out /u/yuv9 's [imgur album here!](http://imgur.com/a/cEeal))
* Look them up on Google via their SteamID. On the SteamRep page from the previous step find the Search Engine Queries box and look for the one with their SteamID 64
 Generally spammer reports will pop up here if they are a regular scammer. You may also find profiles from other trading communities that you can peruse.
* Look up their SteamID64 on the SteamRep forums. (You'll notice a bold search link a few lines above the Google link in the previous screenshot.) Sometimes scammers have been reported in the forum but are not yet registered in the system as a scammer. --added from recommendation by /u/Aitchy21

---
**Steam Profiles and Trustworthiness**

Analzying the trader's Steam profile itself can possibly show red flags. Let's take a look at mine and a few important things to take note of:

http://i.imgur.com/cuHoPiw.jpg

1. If you went to your new doctor's office and the waiting room chairs were busted, not everyone cares about avatars, backgrounds, or fleshing out their profile. A lack of the lived in look doesn't necessarily mean scammer but you may want to look at other signs if their profile puts you off.

2. Badges are important for two reasons. If someone has crafted a lot of badges (Level 15+) they probably actually like Steam

3. Take note of how many games they have and what type of games they are. Many scammers will have very few games and the games they do have will be free to play games or lots of cheap bundle games. The more money someone invests in their account the less likely they are to risk it scamming you for a 5 dollar game. Granted

4. +reps in comments mean nothing. Scammers flock together and these can easily be friends +repping each other to give the illusion of trustworthiness. Also you can remove comments from your profile

---
**Behaviour and Trustworthiness**

* A legitimate trader will be willing to wait for a few minutes; they will not say hurry hurry rush. If they are asking you to make the trade before you are ready then simply say you are no longer interested
* If you have any doubts about something in their reputation or profile be sure to ask them. ""I see you only joined Steam last month. How did you end up getting into trading? Are you new to Steam?"" If they are unwilling to answer questions they probably aren't interested in being on the level with you.
* If you have something that's worrying you

---
**Useful Tools**

* /u/blueshiftlabs has created the [Flair Linker Enhanced](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/wvmk8/psa_flair_linker_enhanced_is_now_available/) extension for Firefox and Google Chrome that beefs up the flair in the subreddit (and other trading subreddits) to make getting in touch with (and doing research on) your trading partner much easier.

* [EnhancedSteam](http://www.enhancedsteam.com/) will

Anyways, etc.

**My process** 
I wanted to find someone who had an Item on their wishlist that was in their 5 most wanted games for the longest time. I found a few people who had a few games from 2010 and even some that had beaten out the date of Praetor's November 24th by a few months, he had more 2010, and less games than all of them. I just wanted to find someone who had wanted something for a long time and a low amount of games. Thank you all again I think I will have to do this again in the future just something a little different next time. Again I'm sorry for closing early! I hope you can all forgive me and just keep your eyes open for me again. Thank you all for your kind words and entries.


Also as for me choosing the game that was done at random also using a dice (6 sided I know) but I just assigned the numbers as to the order he wrote down his game so Fallout New Vegas was a 4 and I rolled a four. So there you have it.

1375749139.0,1js0xz,[PSA] **Sticky** Guide to Avoiding Scammers **Sticky**,computernerd225,94,11,38,"**WARNING: BIG WALL OF TEXT**

There have been lots of instances of scamming/attempted scamming lately.  Here's a guide I found on tf2-trader.net ([Original Link Here)](http://tf2-trader.com/index.php?topic=959.0).

While it applies mostly to TF2 trades

Please feel free to comment about any of the points below (additions or deletions

This will be stickied at the top of the subreddit

***

&gt;This guide will show you the many types of scammers, and how to avoid getting scammed yourself.
&gt;
&gt;Firstly, they will try to scam you, no matter how large or small the trade is.
&gt;
&gt;Using Middlemen (commonly referred to as MM's): In my trading history (since it came out) I've only seen impersonated middlemen or untrustworthy middlemen scam, and the person refuses to use a middleman, you should AUTOMATICALLY refuse to trade with them. They might say ""MM takes too long"" or ""I want a fast trade"" which means they are oh so more wanting to scam you out of your items. Take the other road, use a middleman when unsure. This will most of the time (excluding chargebacks) the best way to prevent a scam. Trusted middlemen have proved their worth in our trading community and I advise you use their service when doing trades for non-TF2 only items.
&gt;
&gt;Let's go through a list on the type of scammers out there!
&gt;
&gt;Before I go, please, post something on their thread, report it to a reputable admin on a fairly known website (SourceOP, TF2Trader, UTC, etc.) and get them banned or reported to Steamrep.
&gt;
&gt;Note: Remember that scammers, they WILL feel satisfied and won't stop until they get more for free. Someone can scam you for as little as a reclaimed to as high as an unusual hat. Be cautious out there!
&gt;
&gt;1) I don't trust Middleman/No MM: The most common type of scammer. He/she will say that there is no need for a middleman and that using a middleman is a waste of time or that middleman may be untrustworthy. Most of the time both of you will have to agree on a trusted middleman (usually Trell, etc.) with viable rep in their respective forums. However, this time of scammer will say ""I don't care, I don't trust him"" and still try to avoid using one. You should immediately delete, take a screenshot, and report it right away! 99% of the time he/she will make you go first and run off with your items/cash/other before you get theirs. The other 1% is when he/she will go first for a small trade and may seem trustworthy, but run off with your belongings in the following trades.
&gt;
&gt;2) You go first: In most cases, read the above.
&gt;
&gt;3) I am new: This is a lesser common scammer, they're most likely a scammer. However, if they are honest traders, they will most likely go first if you have more rep. If someone says they are new and you are new as well, USE A MIDDLEMAN. You can't trust anyone who joined yesterday and wants you to go first with your hard earned money/items.
&gt;
&gt;4) I've been scammed: These guys are my favorite type of scammers because they're also the biggest idiots! They will tell you that they will not go first due to being scammed before in the past. Well, or read #2 type of scammer.
&gt;
&gt;5) 50/50 or increments: Some traders like to go into increments or do what most people call ""50/50"" meaning one person will trade over half of the items/money and the other person will send their half over. Now this could go in one of two ways. The other trader (potential scammer) will make you go first in a 50/50 situation. Once they get your items/cash, but when it comes to the rest of the 50/50, they will run off, making it a 100/50 situation for them. This type of scammer is not that common, but they are lurking out there. This could EASILY be avoided using a middleman!
&gt;
&gt;6) Talkative: Not really easy to spot out, no problem with them going first right? If you bring up using middlemen, they will try their best to avoid it. Some lines may be ""They're a human like all of us and have desires, hence they will scam us my friend!"" or something. Don't forget that EVERYONE here is human and have personal desires. Don't fall for their attempt to word his way out of your scam alerts.
&gt;
&gt;7) Sent money: If I had a scrap for every time this happened. These scammers are indeed one of the most COMMON type of scammers. They only appear in Paypal trades so watch out. Most of the time they will agree to go first, they will say that their money has been ""sent"". A big warning will be that they say something like ""$5 sent to (paypal email). It should be in your balance"" or ""Paypal's been lagging today."" After the above sentences are typed out to you, they will ask you to give you the items since they did their part. How to avoid this? Ask for a screenshot of their transaction details. Paypal lets you see details of a sent/received payment. After this, they will surely delete you from their friends list and run. The other times they use the ""sent"" method is after you've traded (I still advise you much to use a middleman) and say that they've sent the payment, etc. and that Paypal could be lagging or some sorts. Don't even remotely think about going first because this is a guaranteed scam if you give them the items first.
&gt;
&gt;8) Impersonator: The scammer database on SourceOP has nothing but these guys on there! They will often try to scam you by literally cloning a trusted person's Steam profile. Most of the time they will tell you before hesitating ""Here's my rep"" and send you a rep thread belonging to the user they're impersonating. The impersonator's steam profile link (displayed in the address bar) will somewhat resemble the user's profile link. They will be NEAR close, add the person who's getting impersonated, and invite both to a chat. Screenshot that chat, and report them.
&gt;
&gt;Things to note:
&gt;
&gt;Their privacy is set to ""Friends Only"" or ""Private""
&gt;The profile link is VERY similar
&gt;Most of the time, etc.)
&gt;
&gt;9) I gtg: These guys are easily avoided and obvious. They will tel you something like ""I got to go, rather, they're going to delete/block you so their appear offline! Don't EVER fall for this as this is the possibly easiest scam to avoid. TAKE YOUR TIME. Your/Their items aren't going anywhere. This can occur when a middleman is proposed/used. Once a middleman is selected and contacted, they will quickly dodge the trade entirely and delete both middleman and you. No harm done, but easy to screenshot and report.
&gt;
&gt;10) Post Count/Member Length: Oh man
&gt;
&gt;11) Overpaying: Not very common, suggest using a middleman! Both parties are safe and if he doesn't go through with it, then he's a scammer and you can report/spam his thread.
&gt;
&gt;12) Quickswitches: Not really the easiest to catch, it's too good to be true. Sure he may really want the hat, but I haven't seen a Bill's Hat go for a Cow Mangler ever. He will try to get you to believe it's a fair and legit trade. What YOU don't know is that at any moment before YOU click trade, he will ""quick switch"" the item out. Meaning he will replace his most valuable item(s) with (an) item(s) of lesser value. For example, you're trading 3 keys for a Bill's Hat and he switches the Bill's hat for a NV Demo Fro. The ONLY way to prevent this is to TAKE YOUR TIME and do not rush your trade. Once you catch them, it's pretty easy. Just click ""Cancel"" and you're set to go.
&gt;
&gt;13) Two Man Scam(Thanks Celebi!): Another type of scam I might add involves 2 people, another person will trade  request you offering several items, including what the previous owner asked for. As soon as you buy the item, they will both leave the server, leaving you with an unwanted item.
&gt;
&gt;You can watch out for this kind of scam by using common sense
&gt;
&gt;Those are the 13 types of scammers I've come across my day. Here are some tips to prevent them:
&gt;
&gt;* Read the above guide! Congratulations! You made it through a wall of text. Here's a cookie.
* Check their SteamRep/search their name on a scammer database. You will surely catch them there.
* Read stickies! Stickies such as the Scammer Database thread on SourceOP and doing a quick search of their profile will save you a ton of time and items/money
* Take screenshots. You don't know how many little kids have been crying about being scammed on forums without any evidence. You'll get flamed and the scammer will get away with it.
* Use a middleman. I cannot stress this enough. This is one of the ONLY ways you prevent scamming. Make sure they have reputable vouches and you BOTH agree to using them. Scammers will often times suggest a middleman of THEIR liking that you find fishy. Don't agree to that,False,,t5_2skv6,1375749979.0,,mod,t3_1js0xz

1346944135.0,zgaba,[PSA] Estimating the value of your games: a rough guide to how the Steam game swapping market works,delacct,93,8,19,"This is my humble attempt at explaining how trading works and how you can roughly estimate the trading value of the game you have/looking for.

------------------

**Short version:**

Three main factors determine a game's value: time

A few steps which you should take before making an offer.

1. **Check past sale prices** and regional prices (useful sites include: [steamprices.com](http://www.steamprices.com/), [isthereanydeal.com](http://isthereanydeal.com/))
2. Estimate supply and demand for the game you want/have by **[browsing current trades](http://rgameswap.com/steam/list.pl#/button/c/blue/)** or **using the search bar and sorting by most recent**
3. **Make an offer** and/or **[open a new thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/submit)**

Regular traders tend to value games according to past sale prices (and sale frequency), re-trading, collecting, etc), and since prices differ from one region to another, not to mention popularity and many other factors like boxed/other digital store prices, pre-order bonuses, but in the end

------------------

**Long version:**

Factors to consider when trading

1. **Price and value are different things.** This is another way of saying that games are not stable like a currency; they are a commodity. Any time there is a disruption in one of the three factors mentioned above (**time, the value of a game shifts. One-time or non-regular traders who really just want a certain game right now will value that game highly, thus since the demand is very high, they are often willing to ""overpay"" from the usual trading value because they're still getting a discount from the retail price. Regular traders are more focused on comparative trading value, re-tradability, or ability to turn a profit. Just look at trading of CS:GO and Dota 2 betas to see that price is not the same as value.

2. **Regional pricing.** Prices vary by region, Europeans, and Australians, we really do have a broad mix. In any trading community there will always be a few regular traders who live in countries with cheaper prices who are willing to sell their games for 75% of the US retail price or less, because they're still making a profit.

3. **Supply and demand.** This plays into point 1, and sometimes other events, like giveaways, seriously affect supply and demand. Take the Mass Effect games -- they were 75% off in December 2011, but have not been at that price on Steam since then. As a result, anyone who happens to still have one who would likely expect much more than just another $20 game for it, because almost every other popular $20 game has been on sale for 75% in the meantime. A good example of the opposite situation is when the developers of Nuclear Dawn in June 2012 decided to give a free giftable copy to everyone who owned the game. The supply skyrocketed, which affects the potential supply (and thus either drives or stifles demand).

4. **People trade for different reasons.** Some trade to find something to play today/this week/this month; others are long-term traders who may not always be interested in a particular game but subsidizing their gaming

Lowballers are annoying, accept good ones. What this means to each person will vary, and that's the whole point. If everyone valued their games the same, no one would ever make a trade.

1373892944.0,1ic4j6,[PSA] Not all (key) traders are scammers. Use common sense.,ZeMedic,89,6,48,"Seemingly every day this subreddit has people saying they got scammed

Feel free to post other tips in the comments please. let's educate the masses!

&gt; **Steamrep.com**
Before you even speak to a trader use [Steamrep.](http://steamrep.com/) Place their profile link in the bar at the top to see if they're a registered scammer. Also It's not a bad idea to use the [Copy Info](http://i.imgur.com/oFp27BS.jpg) button &amp; save it in a .txt for future reference. Alternatively

&gt; **Check their profile creation date &amp; that they have game purchases.**
To check this view their Badges &amp; see the [Years of Service badge.](http://puu.sh/3Dqw9.png) Courtesy of [Multicast](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/1ic4j6/psa_not_all_key_traders_are_scammers_use_common/cb30a7e)

&gt; **Confirm they are a reddit/SteamGameSwap user.**
Always ask the person to post in your thread

&gt; **If it looks too good to be true then it probably is.**
Self explanatory

&gt; **Exercise common sense.**
If a trader is in a rush or pushing you that's generally a bad sign

&gt; **The trader with the key goes first.**
~~I don't care how much 'rep' they have

&gt; **Trading keys.**
There is always a debate on this subject (and rightly so) as it entirely comes down to experience. The flair rule of the subreddit is an excellent guideline and is generally very accurate. Steam profile 'rep' is easily faked and should be taken with a pinch of salt. From [Multicast:](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/1ic4j6/psa_not_all_key_traders_are_scammers_use_common/cb30a7e) Trade according to the reddit rules. i.e People with lower-tiered flair go before people with higher-tiered flair. From [Jc36:](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/1ic4j6/psa_not_all_key_traders_are_scammers_use_common/cb3084r) Get enough flair to go second

&gt; **It's ok to decline a trade.**
A lot of the scammer chat logs I've read seem to occur because a person was already committed to getting a trade even when the circumstances aren't right. So if it doesn't feel right

Be on the lookout for scammer w8baby who is now back to his old ways and is targeting all of reddit's trading forums. Over the last year or so he has already scammed people out of hundreds, items, and money.

He uses the following aliases:

* w8baby
* spekkter
* adversesin
* nijix123
* w8babyplease
* Beemo
* Earl Sweatshirt
* simonsimonla
* spekktrum
* trumspekk

* wiggumcollins
* elazulspirit

* http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198052979999

His most recent scams involve trying to charge stuff to your cellphone. He will ask for your phone number

**Now for the fun part:**

I have all of w8baby's personal information.

Before, so most likely I will just go and tell his parents (he's Asian so his parents will probably be pissed). My goal is not to hurt or punish w8baby, my goal is to get him to stop. I believe his parents are best able to do this.

(New users, check this out.)",SteamGameSwap,84,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/wjpha/psa_rsteamgameswap_master_class_how_to_utilize/, SGS). We've been seeing a lot of confusion lately about the exact procedures involved in making trades here

Trading here is a little more complicated than other places

_All right

***

### Preliminaries

Your first trade on SGS will need to be made through the Steam Trading system. This means that you'll need an extra game (or TF2/Dota 2 items) in your inventory. (Click `View -&gt; Inventory` in Steam to see what you have.)

In particular, Humble Bundles, or Paypal.

The list of Steam Trading items is essentially limited to:

* Extra (gift) copies of Steam games
* TF2 items
* Dota 2 items
* Items for some other F2P games that aren't very common around here.

_Once you have your items

***

### Posting Your Trade

So you have some extra games you want to trade. Maybe you got extra copies, and there are games you want that you don't have. Excellent! You've come to the right place.

The first thing to do is to search to **see if anyone wants the game you have.** Use the search box, great! Skip down to **Making an Offer** below.

If you can't find anyone

Titles are everything here - to help people find your post

**[H] `&lt;Games you have&gt;` [W] `&lt;Games you want&gt;`**

For example, you could post this:

    [H] Portal 2

If you're not sure what you want in exchange for your game

    [H] Portal 2

If you're willing to buy games for the other person

    [H] $5 Steam Wallet [W] Portal 2

[_For more information about posting formats

**Now wait for a response!** Make sure to search every few hours for people who might have missed your thread and posted one of their own. If a response isn't one that you're interested in, skip down to ***Making the Trade.***_

***

### Making an Offer

Making an offer is quite simple - if someone's posted a game that you want

The poster should respond to you telling you whether the offer is acceptable. Feel free to continue discussion

***

### Making the Trade

Once you've agreed on an offer, watch this video to learn how it works.](http://youtu.be/fpLWqZRJNVU)

Congratulations! You're now the owner of a shiny new game. Wait though - you're not done! You still need to do a couple more things.

***

### After the Trade

There's a few things you should do after a trade is finished:

1. **Close your thread.** If you're done with a trade thread

2. **Confirm your trade.** To do this:

    1. Click the **Confirm a Trade** button in the sidebar.
    2. One trade partner should create a new top-level comment containing the name of the trade partner
    3. The other trade partner should reply **to that comment** with ""Confirmed"" or something similar

3. **Apply for flair.** Flair is the Steam icon next to people's names that indicates how many trades they've done, then apply for it.

    To apply for flair

    1. Your steamID64. To find this, and copy the line that says `steamID64`.
    2. The **permalink** to the confirmation you made in #2 above. Make sure to permalink to the *parent* comment (the one with the information

    The mods will review your trade details, you'll get a message back telling you to check out your shiny new flair!

    Congratulations, and non-Steam-Trading items!

A couple of things:

#1. **Recently large numbers of threads have been systematically downvoted.** It could be anyone

The subreddit is growing constantly (we're almost at 10, so it’s no surprise that downvotes happen.

**I would propose this solution: make it a habit that if you see a thread with negative votes for no good reason

#2. **[""Voting cliques""](http://www.reddit.com/help/faq#Whatconstitutescheating) are against the spirit and rules of reddit.** Upvoting and downvoting is already minimal on r/SGS

Sure, and there's only a thin line between this and the ""mass downvotes"" tactic. Neither can really be policed, but it’s unfair to those who play by the rules, and in the long term, it creates a more negative and competitive atmosphere, rather than the friendly place we want /r/SGS to be. So please don't.

---------------------------------
In the long term both of these tactics drag down the quality of the community as a whole.

**TL;DR #1 Some bad actors are mass downvoting threads; please help combat this by upvoting threads with negative votes until they get back up to 1.**

Steam Market Beta has allowed for us users the chance to add funds to our Steam wallets without actually spending the same amount that we get in return. How is this done? It is done through the sale of items in the Steam Market. The most popular and arguably the easiest item to sell are the Mann Co. Supply Crate Keys. These keys can be picked up from anywhere from $1.25 – $1.40 PayPal on the “gray market” and can be sold on the Steam Market for at least $1.85 Steam Wallet^1. That’s almost a guaranteed 33% discount on Steam Wallet funds. At its best

When you take this into consideration, without further ado, let me present

****

**orijinal’s Guide for discounted Steam wallet funds^2**

***Part I. Pre-Requisites***

****

**Step 1: Create a PayPal account if you have not done so already**

You will need to use PayPal in order to buy Mann Co. Supply Crate Keys from the “gray market”. Other payment methods such as Moneypak or Bitcoins are also accepted by sellers

**Step 2: Get your PayPal account verified**

This is extremely important. Most sellers that sell items to those without reputation require that at least your PayPal be verified before they consider selling to you. They also take other things into consideration (i.e. your Steam account age, you can refer to [**PayPal’s Help Center**](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/helpcenter/article/?solutionId=10568&amp;).

**Step 3: Create an account on SourceOP**

There are indeed other places you can go to in order to buy TF2 keys (like /r/tf2trade), you should be able to create posts.

**Step 4: Create a SourceOP Reputation Thread**

After you verify your e-mail account and are able to post on the forums

The title of your thread should be “(insert SOP username here)’s Rep Thread”. For example, you must include at the bare minimum your SteamID64 URL.

The easiest way to do this is to head over to [**SteamRep**](http://www.steamrep.com) and insert the link to your Steam profile in it. Once you finish that

**Note that this part of the process was merely just to lay the foundation for your endeavor to buy TF2 keys for PayPal. You will not need to do any of this again.**

****

***Part II. Buying keys from the gray market***

****

***Step 1. Find a reputable seller that is willing to sell to those with little or no reputation***

Head over to the [**TF2 Item Buying/Selling**](http://forums.sourceop.com/forums/32-TF2-Item-Buying-Selling) forum on SourceOP. Using the search function on your browser (CTRL+F)

I would not recommend buying from that person in particular as that seller does not have much rep. Try to find reputable sellers with at least a few pages of positive reputation.

***Step 2. Discuss the details of the trade with the other person***

First

If the seller agrees to sell you keys

***Step 3. Sending the payment***

To ensure that you are sending the payment via the “Gift” option^4, your fee will be 1% of the total assuming you are using funds directly from your bank account to make the payment. If you are using a credit card, it will be 5.9% of the total. Once you have sent the payment, inform the seller so that the person will check to see if it was received.

***Step 4. Wait for the seller to initiate a Steam trade***

It may take a few minutes for the seller to verify your payment so just sit tight. If all goes well

In the event of a scam

***Step 5. Exchanging reputation***

Once the trade is complete

**I [bought/sold] [insert item and quantity here]. [I/He/She] went first

For instance,

&gt; I bought 10 keys from him. I sent the payment first

The exchange of reputation is important because not only will it make it easier for you to purchase from the gray market in the future

****

**Part III. Selling keys on the Steam Market**

****

***Step 1. Navigate to the Steam Market under the Community Tab on Steam to see the current key prices***

Once you are on the [**Steam Market**](http://steamcommunity.com/market/) page, meaning that you would be gaining $1.85 Steam wallet per key sold assuming you matched the lowest price.

***Step 2. Decide the price at which you would like to sell your keys for

If you don’t want to wait

****

If you have any questions or concerns

****

^1 *Your results WILL vary. As more and more people become aware of how the current market allows you to get a discount on Steam wallet

^2 *Should you decide you want to try this out

^3 *I am in no way affiliated with that seller nor am I endorsing their shop. It was just an example thread with a title that would let you know that the seller was willing to sell keys to those with little or no rep. In fact

^4 *The PayPal Gift option is not available in every region. If you are unable to send as a gift, if I wanted to sell 10 keys for $13.50, you would need to send me $14.36.*

^5 *Most sellers that sell to those with little or no rep usually price their keys at around $1.40, you should be able to buy keys at around the $1.30 price range.*",,False,,t5_2skv6,1362557932.0,tier4,

###FIRST OF ALL:

Sup guys. Not much? That's good to hear

---------------------------

###SECONDLY:

We got a nice message in modmail concerning how it's kinda hard to find the games you want

*""I was browsing around to find different sites to trade steam games because this is the largest and most trustworthy site i've found, i'm sure your aware of these problems. I was wondering if the reddit platform would allow for a site that is more designed like [this](http://www.steamcompanion.com/steamtrading/index.php) website. It allows for individual games to be searched for and then list who has them and can send messages to those who have the games, which would eliminate the need for a limit to posting, and editing, etc. I don't know if anyone has brought this up before. If they have, sorry for bringing it back up. But, i'm sure if you posted a PSA asking for someone to help re-design the subreddit i'm sure they would help :D. Thanks for reading!""*

Now, but I would very much like to bring your attention to [**THIS EXCITING BLUE TEXT RIGHT HERE!**](http://www.rgameswap.com/steam/list.pl) Why's that? This is a site which automatically scrapes link titles and puts them into an easily-searchable interface! Boo yeah!

It's important to note that this is why AutoModerator removes posts without spaces in the titles - the spaces actually need to be there for the site to parse the posts properly. :)

-----------------------------------

###THIRDLY:

24 hour rule. Remember it. What's this, report it and either **comment in the thread** saying why you reported or **message the mods** saying why you reported it - we really don't have the time to check every single poster's history.

-----------------------------------

###FOURTHLY:

Evading AutoMod will earn you a ban - specifically when evading AutoModerator in post titles. I've said it before

PayPal trades requiring Blue flair and above? Shitty rules. That doesn't prevent people from getting scammed. Every now and then you get a post saying [PSA] x is a scammer

1354883517.0,14fw0x,[PSA] TradeStarter,runtyrobot,63,9,120,"Updated Post - Alpha 0.2 - **[DONE UPDATING - CAN STILL BE WONKY]**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**TradeStarter**

I felt it was about time I updated the post, as you did earlier! Thanks :)

**Recent Update**

* Gifts are now marked by [g] instead of the **(!)** which was used earlier.
* Tuned down the megalomania
* Page title changed to TradeStarter
* Added alertmessages; User not found or private profile. Should clear on new searches. **Fixed**: Cleared before it showed the alerts. D'oh.
* Typing with a kitten walking on the keyboard is hard.
* Updated the copy function to unmark
* Added 'Start Trade' to the top nav. Start Trade basicly does your job for you - and opens a new tab/window on SGS


**What is TradeStarter**

TradeStarter is a simple system
TradeStarter is currently geared towards SGS - but I aim to make it usable for other sites aswell

**Known Bugs**

* StartTrade: **The encodeURI in Firefox is acting up - and won't parse data to reddit properly.**
* The item counter can get a bit wonky if you have more than three of the same type of item. Steam doesn't seem to deliver the correct amount of JSON objects. I'm currently investigating this.
* If just one item in a stack of items is region locked or untradable
* If you have a vast inventory


**How do I use it?**

* Go to http://runtyrobot.com/tradestarter/
* Put in your username or steamurl (it SHOULD be able to differentiate
* After a few seconds you get a checklist of your inventory. 
* You can now proceed to mark and unmark the items you want and do not want to put up for trade. 
* Once you're done

**Legend / Formatting**

* [R] Means one or more items in a stack is region locked.
* [g] Means one or more items in a stack is untradable/giftable only.
* x (n) indicates the number of items in a stack. *Still a bit wonky*
* All titles are linked to their store page

**Requirements**

* Public profile
* Publicly visible inventory
* Javascript enabled (default)
* Browser that supports Flash (for copying).

**Do you knick our datas?**

I feel it's only fair to tell what and if I keep any of your data. But the truth is

**Any upcoming plans for updates?**

Why yes! You people have been more than kind and supplied me with plenty of ideas - and I have quite a few things to work with

* Selective formatting (Reddit / true text / bb)
* Selective sorting (Alphabetically
* Save profile (cookie), you don't have to type. Hell, you don't even have to move your hand to the keyboard.
* Specified Region Lock information
* Find out why the iterator isn't working properly.
* Optional linking to item in inventory
* Automatically generated inventory link
* Your idea... :)

**Questions or comments**

* I love to hear your feedback, when it comes to trying to figure out how to fix the issues you guys encounter.
* Comments and ideas are more than welcome! I try to encorporate as many things as I can - but I do take it upon myself to decide which updates are to be made when. Is it easy to fix or a brilliant idea that would benefit everybody

1333226304.0,rmt26,[Announcement] FatmanRising's guide on how to do succesful trades when using Paypal (or alternatively not getting scammed by e-rascals).,FatManRising,60,5,35,"Hello everybody

Many of you probably haven't heard of me as I've been missing in action for a couple of months

I read *ahem* sgs_mods_are_pricks *ahem* post this morning and well, but also that no official rule will ever prevent scams, and that in the end, it's all about detecting scammers yourself. So, with that in mind, I decided to make a guide to help begginers and veterans alike. 

Before we begin with the formal guide, and have been since SGS started. However, I'm writting this guide not as a mod, but as a trader. I've been trading for a couple of years now, and with around 60 trades under my belt, with about half of them being Paypal related, I've never been scammed once. Because I don't like risking, but I've also avoided potential scams.

Was I lucky? Probably yes

**Always make sure the Paypal account is verified. Always^always^always**.

Seriously, it's simple, just log in to Paypal and then type this address in your browser:

https://www.paypal.com/verified/pal=username@mail.com

Where ""username@mail.com"" is the trader's email associated with Paypal. So, you should type https://www.paypal.com/verified/pal=average.joe@gmail.com. 

If someone you're dealing with is not verified

**Analyze the other trader's behaviour.**

This one is the hardest, but in the end, if you don't like losing, you won't.

Here's some examples of phrases you should look out for:

&gt;*Hey bro

Most probably a scammer, why should you go first? Either avoid the trade or request a middleman. Regardless of flair, if you don't feel safe, request a middleman. Said middleman can be a mod in SGS, a trader you both trust, a mod of other trading subreddit (like tf2trade), etc. Just make sure it's a person of trust so you don't both get scammed.

&gt;Shortly after adding the guy to Steam and saying hi:

&gt;*Send the money to tough@guy.com. After I receive the money I'll give you your game. No questions please do as I say.*

Sometimes you'll come across this ""tough guy"". He won't say hi, I don't like dealing with rude people so I avoid trades with them.

&gt;*Hurry pls

Most probably a scammer. He'll tell you to hurry up because he has to leave or has another deal. If he can't wait

&gt;*Hey I'm not home

&gt;Alternatively:

&gt;*Hey I'm not home

Wait for the trader to get home. If he doesn't reply it means it was a failed attempt at scamming.

&gt;*Hey it seems I have some trouble with Paypal atm. Can you send the me the game/key and I pay you when I fix the problem.*

&gt;Alternatively

&gt;*Hey I don't have enough funds

Don't be a Good Guy Greg. Wait for the other trader to fix the Paypal issues before you send anything.

**If the deal is too good to be true

I always expect a max of 20% below the lowest sale price, because tradeable gifts are safe to be traded, just don't fall for a guy selling you Darksiders 2 for $20 without proof and asking you to go first. Common sense applies.

It is also a good idea to check websites like [SteamGameSales](http://www.steamgamesales.com/) for current and past deals. This way you can have an idea of what games go for currently and also avoid bad trades.

Because SteamGameSales doesn't cover every single site, you'll find something. 

**When dealing with accounts

Most accounts, Battlenet and even Steam have options to change your email and password. Changing your email is the most secure way of cutting ties with the previous owner, and giving you the power to change everything else. Make sure the owner doesn't hesitate about changing his email (or lying about it), because if he does, he will probably scam you by recovering the password later.

**Here are some tips to determine how reliable the trader is:**

* Add the trader to Steam.

Even if the trade is not Steam related, it gives you access to more information about the trader, allowing you to check the activity, games played, etc. The more there is in the table, the less chances there are for a scam to happen. Anonymity gives you power, so don't give the other trader too much power.

* Be a stalker for a couple of minutes.

Yepe, which means the trader will rather not destroy its reputation so easiliy.

* Do a quick search of the trader with SteamRep

I've never used the site myself

Take note that these are some extra precautions but are not necessary in order for the trade to go smoothly. 

**Conclusion**

In the end, for the sake of both, request the aid of a middleman or don't proceed with the trade. As I said, I've probably missed a few good deals, but I've also avoided being scammed.

**TL;DR: Read the damn thing!**

&gt;This guy adds me: http://steamrep.com/search?q=76561198061569017
&gt;
&gt;Asks me for the price of one of my unusuals. Wants to check that my unusual is not duped and sends me a link, less than 15-20 seconds pass, I re-open the trade window and see that it says ""trade completed"" and freak the fuck out, a split second later, he deletes me.
&gt;
&gt;Anyways,  the thing is that it happened in less than 30 seconds between me clicking the link and him stealing my 6 earbuds and [Unusual Defiant Spartan \(searing plasma\)](http://www.tf2items.com/item/708322732) 
&gt;
&gt;Here's the conversation: http://i.imgur.com/qDFIq.png
&gt;
&gt;***TL;DR:  don't click on any links within TF2.***
&gt;
&gt;*Edit*:  To clear some things up:
&gt;
&gt;-I did not have to log into anything after clicking the link.  I just clicked it and a pop up window came up saying it was checking my bp and might take a while.
&gt;
&gt;-I did not have any items in the trade window.  He had to have added the items himself and completed the trade himself.  I am guessing that he tailor made a script to add the specific items I had (earbuds) and then complete the trade since it happened so quickly.
&gt;
&gt;-By the time you read this I hope he's listed as a scammer on steamrep
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;*Edit2*:  After talking with a few others I am going to guess that this scammer wrote a specific script that added the earbuds and unusual and completed the trade by itself.  The scammer was after my unusual Defiant Spartan which I have never advertised as for sale

1363801847.0,1aoc2y,[PSA] Valve has lifted 200-sale limit on Steam Community Market (the catch inside),rikker_,53,6,46,"The catch: US residents and citizens must provide information to Valve for compliance with IRS tax code in order to exceed the 200-sale limit. HOWEVER

From the FAQ:

&gt; **Is there a limit on the number of transactions I can participate in in the Community Market?**

&gt; Currently there is no limit on the number of transactions you can participate in. However, requires us to collect certain information from you if you engage in more than 200 separate sales transactions in a calendar year. In particular, **if you are a U.S. citizen or resident**, you will need to provide us with your name, address and Social Security Number, and **if you are not a U.S. citizen or resident**, you will need to provide evidence of your non-U.S. status on an online form we provide to you. We will be providing a link to these forms and a process by which you can provide the needed information if and as you approach the 200 sales limit. We may use a third-party to collect this information. You can choose not to provide this information if you wish, and any items listed will be removed. Note that, all of your accounts will be treated as a single account.

And: 

&gt; **Will you be providing 1099’s based on my transactions in the Community Market?**

&gt; The United States Internal Revenue Service requires us to report gross sales for,000 in gross sales proceeds from those sales transactions in that same calendar year, from all of that subscriber's accounts. If you are a U.S. citizen or resident and exceed both of these thresholds, we will report the amount of gross sales to the IRS and provide you with Form 1099.

Hello r/SGS! I've got a little story for you. I recently bought a Spec Ops: The Line key in retail, as I see today that even the [Steam store price](http://store.steampowered.com/app/50300/) of the game has been lowered to €20. Unlucky me! The next logical step would probably be for me to activate the game and play it myself, but I'm quite sure there's someone out here who can devote a lot more time to the game than I'll be able to in the near future. Ideally, I'd love the winner to be someone that has relatively few games, enough so that he/she'd play the game immediately and enjoy it. Oh well.

1366751752.0,1cyo92,[PSA] Apparently even trading through steam is not safe now!,Aitchy21,56,11,44,"Few days ago a guy added me and offered me some games

So today I notice that the games have vanished out my inventory. Done some further digging and went back to the guys profile to see a new comments calling him a scammer.

So I guess this guy maybe purchased the games in dodgy way or with a stolen credit card and steam have just removed the games without informing anyone.

Added they guy who commented also and found out he had traded a dragon hook for two games also which he added to his library. He got a warning yesterday of some kind and the games were removed.

Made a steam rep report and opened a steam support ticket.

Never came across this before in a year of trading

So if this is how they are now cracking down on dodgy purchases how the hell are we to know who to trade with. Searched the guy and he was clean on steam rep and had a few games and a few hundred hours playtime.

Just kinda annoyed at steam for not informing or contacting etc

I feel that steam should not be removing items without even informing steam users that they have been scammed through steam trading

They are basically just putting their hands in your pocket and taking what you paid for because you happened to get scammed through steam trading by someone using dodgy payment methods and bypassing their checks etc.

It's been a while since I last posted an update, just to get the feel of the community and to involve you in the future plans of TradeStarter.


As I mentioned, I hope people will make due and use the system as is.


In the recent week, who pointed me towards a possible solution to the unreliable counter. This means that TradeStarter, as of today, now is able to count the number of identical items in your inventory - correctly.


Furthermore, questions or issues. Some people have contacted me via twitter - and I really forget to check that. But my Steam Client is on all my computers (work pc included), so there should be a chance of getting a hold of me. And furthermore I've added a paypal donation button, with encouragement of a few users who suggested I should do so. All donations are welcome, small and large - it's all **greatly** appriciated.
And lastly



**What does the future hold?**

I'm doing the best I can to find time to create the new large updates, Ezpharez, has decided to help out with the development of the 'new' TradeStarter - and his involvement is greatly appriciated. 
We're still aiming towards the light-weight feel and easy usability of TradeStarter - but working on far more depth and options

* Added customizability to your listing
* Customizable and reusable header/footers
* Friend Inventory Search (If someone you know has something you're looking for
* CD-Key Storage - (So you can keep your CD-keys safe
* TradeStarter Search - (Search the recently created lists - and contact the user - optional participation ofcourse!)
* And many more.


I'm glad people like the site and hope you'll continue to use it!

Have a great night! :)

http://store.steampowered.com/?cc=us - Link to your region steam store (replace the us with your region initials)

Sub ID - The identification number associated with any steam game. Found by visiting the regional steam store you want to purchase it from in a web browser (not the steam client)

onlyallowrunincountries - Found on the a game's Sub ID page on thebronasium under Extended Info. Presence of this line indcates that the game is region locked and will only be activatable/playable in the countries listed next to it. If this line is not present on the page

Proof:
Max Payne 3 is a well known region locked game on steam

The presence of a tag does not mean that the game is region locked though. Take Sleeping Dogs for example. Find the russian version's sub ID page and you'll find no onlyallowrunincountries line. Ask around the net and you'll find that these RU tagged games are playable anywhere in the world

1345182938.0,yd4fq,[PSA] Beginner Guide - How to value your games and prevent getting ripoff,warheat1990,55,9,102,"##INTRODUCTION
It's been a while since Valve introduced Steam trading feature on Steam. The amount of lowballers is too damn high lately(I'm calling it, continue reading. Otherwise, leave now.  
  
**Note : This Guide is based on my experience in Steam trading
  
##You and your trade partner games value
First things first, your Fallout 3 GOTY doesn't worth $20 and your Skyrim doesn't worth $60 because Fallout 3 GOTY is on sale for $5 which is 75% off and Skyrim is on sale for $30 which is 50% off.  
##UPDATE :  
1. I forgot to mention that some games hold more value if the games hasn't been on sale for a long time
2. Games are on 4 pack hold less value, so the value goes with 4 pack value / 4 which is less than $7.5.  
3. BETA GAMES : Some beta games doesn't have any price on the store. At the moment, more than that, you got ripped off.  
  
##UPDATE 2 :  
1. I never think that I'll get many response here, if a games hasn't been on sale and there are not ton of copies floating around, it might hold more value than lowest and vice versa.  
2. Games that appears on bundle will have less value. You can see the list on this link www.steamgifts.com/bundles/list  
  
##How do I check the lowest sales value on my/trade partner games
There is several sites that provide a track on Steam games price. I personally used www.steamprices.com, for example Fallout 3 GOTY(http://www.steamprices.com/us/app/22370/fallout-3-game-of-the-year-edition), on the bottom page, you can see that the lowest value on that games is $4.99(US Store). So, you should always check your games and your trade partner games value to make sure you get a fair trade.  
  
Note : this site also provided price on different region like EU, etc.  
  
##Fair trade example  
2x Witcher Enhanced Edition(lowest $2.5) with Titan Quest Gold(lowest $5).  
Darkness II ROW (lowest $12.5) with CIV V GOTY (lowest $12.5).  
Skyrim (lowest $30) with Max Payne 3 (lowest $30).  
www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/ycl8s/h_entire_inventory_w_paypal_offers/ (sorry if I haven't ask permission to OP for posting his link
the list goes on...  
  
##Few Exceptions  
Now that you already grasp the basic on how to get a fair trade, Binary Domain, etc. Lowballers will get mad and usually tell you that they bought their games in US Store, but believe me. most of these games came from Russia store. So you shouldn't value it that high. Note that you can check every region price on www.steamprices.com.

Also note that the ROW version of AAA games that are region locked in Russian will hold more value than not region locked. For example : Borderlands 2 (region locked in Russia)
  
##Never ever accept giftable games offer  
Never ever accept games that are only giftable(not tradeable), it is probably a scam. This apply to paypal trade and key trade as well.  
Note : From my experience

##CONCLUSION  
Remember there is a difference between profit and lowball, if you are new to trading, take a couple mins to read this wall of text.  
  
If you need help to if your trade is fair or unfair. You can post it here

That is all

yes, but its reality.

I am little tired of all traders who are merchandising their Dota like : ""you will get extra invite in inventory when you unpack it""

NO :)

I tested 2 copies yesterday on friends account

Dota 2 - 2 pack gift is just 1 dota for 1 person and does not give any more additional invites

Back in December there were some versions, and yes they were giving 2 additional invites once you activated them.

I know

Feel free to bump because its bad to people trade and than feel bad when they dont get extra invite.

Also, so dont put blame on him.

And I hope Valve can fix this mess 

ps. just bonus for people who dont know :
you can win key (like letters and numbers 354535-dfggdfgg-545456456)

in this thread (read the rules):

http://www.playdota.com/forums/showthread.php?t=549077


In past, but from 2-3 weeks ago, keys are also single, so watch out for that. And its not recommended to trade for key anyway.

Also 1 thing that confuses many people

If you have new account (Im not sure whats restriction

You can send them as gifts, but you cant trade tham using Steam trade screen.

Gifts become tradable after 30 days from point they were created.
Same rule is applied for purchasing.

If new account wants to buy game for trading

If you have more useful suggestion regarding trading, or bump this untill most people learn about Dota 2 - 2 pack gifts

1. **_To protect our existing users._** We require all users to make their first trade using Steam's built-in [trading interface](http://youtu.be/fpLWqZRJNVU) to establish a minimum level of reputation. **Once you do that

2. **_Because you are an easy target_**. We have enough of a problem with scammers as it is. If we let inexperienced traders come in here with giant bullseyes on their foreheads, you give the key first, scammer goes offline and cackles all the way to the bank.

3. **_To prevent key spam._** Every time there is a giveaway of beta keys, or there is a killer deal on a site like Amazon, we get an influx of users. It's not that we don't want you. But due to the _other_ reasons listed above, we need you to play by our rules and contribute positively to the subreddit, and not just be part of a tsunami of posts for the same handful of games, which washes over us and drives up the workload for moderators and the signal-to-noise ratio for everyone else, without really increasing the quality of the subreddit.

Edit: These are simply my thoughts and interpretations as one of the moderators. Other moderators may disagree with me on some points.

###Addendum 1: How you as a user with flair can help:

Politely explain the policy to new users and point them to this PSA. When you do this

###Addendum 2: If you have an outstanding flair request:

Find your flair request in your outbox and reply to yourself to ""bump"" it to the top of the stack. It's okay to do that, it may take anywhere from a few hours to a few days to get your flair. Your patient is appreciated. (If you have flair and are waiting for an upgrade, you may need to be extra patient for the time being.)",,False,,t5_2skv6,,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/11i2tb/psa_why_doesnt_sgs_allow_new_users_to_trade_keys/

1331438960.0,qr4v9,[PSA] Do not hijack trades,blueshiftlabs,42,6,29,"Please do not hijack trades.

Trade hijacking is when someone has offered a trade to the OP

Example:

&gt; **[H] Half-Life 2 [W] Offers**  
&gt; posted by *User1*

&gt;&gt; **reply from _User2_**  
&gt;&gt; Would you take Portal for it?

&gt;&gt;&gt; **reply from _User3_**  
&gt;&gt;&gt; I can do that

User2 proceeds to trade Portal to User3 in exchange for HL2.

In this instance

To prevent hijacking

* **OP** should reply to each offer in the thread

* **People making offers** should ignore any other counteroffers until the OP has the chance to respond.

* **Other users** should not offer to complete a trade in the place of OP

In our example above

~~Trade hijacks may be removed without notice.~~

**EDIT:**

Some users have brought up some good points about trying to regulate this. With those points in mind

However, that's one thing, but make sure that they have had that chance.

Here is the link to his profile: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198079657824

So the explanation basically is, I don't see anything in his trade box and so I ask him if he has it.  He then tells me that his client is glitched and so I made the initial mistake of taking his word and blindly traded those items.  I did not receive anything, and he proceeds to up the ante by requesting a Borderlands 2 Skin Pack and so I buy it and offer it if he has proof that he has Fortune Summoners.   I suggest a screenshot, and 40 minutes later he returns with a screenshot (which I should've assumed was photoshopped).  Regardless, I just go with the trade hoping for the best, and he gets the DLC while I still received nothing.

I've decided to do a giveaway of **TWO** orcs must die copies. You might ask me, this community has been great with people like memske who helped people buy mirror's edge cheaper at no cost at all and the mods who do regular giveaways. 

I wanted to help people buy high violence versions copies of left 4 dead 2 when the sale was up. Unfortunately

Anyway on to the giveaway!

My conditions of the giveaway are as below :

* 1. **You must not own the game.** I would preferably like to see the winner activate the gift on his/her account. But I trust that the winner will do it. I know many people here are out to make a profit

If I find that you own the game

* 2. Pick a number. Any number from 1-999. I'll do a draw through random.org and pm you if you've won. I'll also announce the winner here.

My contest ends when the weekend deals end. I might add more copies if I'm feeling even more generous

**Good luck everyone!**

**EDIT 1** --&gt; I've found a few people posting here who've already own the game. Those entries are automatically DISQUALIFIED. I'm sorry. But I am hoping this copy goes to someone who doesn't own it. 

**EDIT 2** --&gt; Carry on. No number 1s found. But I would prefer if you'd just enter your number plainly. Reddit has some formatting issues.

    * Approaching you directly on Steam, since they might be banned from /r/SGS.)_

Valve inadvertently re-labeled all vanilla copies of Dead Island that existed in people's inventories as ""Game of the Year

I believe I have the answer. I imagine this has been covered elsewhere

**[Here is an illustration that I made](http://i.imgur.com/xnZoY.png)** demonstrating how to distinguish between the two.

**Don't trust the logo or the large font title.** As you can see

If the Dead Island in your inventory is one you purchased

* Did you purchase Dead Island on or later than July 26
* If no

I just removed this thread:

Another banned user returns! Must be my lucky day. This is now the _seventh_ account of his that I've banned.

For those keeping score at home:

* Banned Reddit accounts: /u/arterqwen1, /u/qwenarter, /u/ArterQwenn, /u/ArterQween, /u/Arterr

* Steam account and alts: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198066595360, http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067220486

AFAIK this user has never successfully completed a scam here, he had many fake rep comments left on his profile by his own alt accounts; all four of the accounts I was able to locate are less than 2 months old. Now I see those fake rep comments have all been deleted, too! I guess even his own alts think he's untrustworthy. :(

**About SteamGameSwap**

This is a reddit community centered around the exchange of Steam games. Our goal from the beginning has been to provide a secure and friendly place for reddit users to exchange games. Of course there are rules and guidelines, if you are friendly and respectful the flavour will be reciprocated.



----



 **How should I browse the community**

It is heavily suggested that you search by new. This is the most effective way to scan the subreddit when looking for trades. This way you see all the newest posts and discourages any kind of bias using downvotes and upvotes. Downvotes and upvotes are essentially useless in this subreddit

 - Open trade threads have a blue arrow icon
 - Closed trade threads have a red do not enter icon
 - PSA and announcement threads have a yellow exclamation point icon
 - Other threads have a green plus icon


----

  **Is there anything specific I should know about these icons?**

Closing a post does not prevent people from commenting

 - You're subscribed to /r/SGS and you are viewing from the frontpage
 - You have subreddit CSS turned off in your global Reddit settings
 - You are browsing through /r/all or a multi-reddit.


----

  
 **Is there a format I must follow?**

Yes. Posts must follow the correct format to be recognized as a trade thread.

**The correct format for trades is as follows:**

*[H] what you have [W] what you want*

Anything different is incorrect. Spacing is **very** important.


----


**PSA threads should follow this format:**

*[PSA] Information people should know*


----


*[ANNOUNCEMENT] is reserved for mod use


----


**How do I complete a trade?**

After you have finished the trading process with your partner

**Once there make a top-level post in the thread with the following information:**

 - The name of your trading partner
 - The names of the games you traded
 - A link to the original trade thread - if possible link to the comment that started the trade by using the permalink button in the lower left corner of the comment


----

The final step is to send the link to the comment you made to your partner. Have your partner confirm the trade by commenting.


----


**What is flair? Why do we have it?**

There are 7 kinds of flair:

Grey, Green, Purple, Gold, and Bright Red. They are primarily for notoriety in the subreddit, but can also be used to link your Steam profile for streamlined trading. Each color represents a tier you can reach by trading. Keeping in mind each tier comes with it's own prerequisites which you can procure by increasing your karma level and account age.


----

**The criterias which must be met for each tier are as follows:**

* Gray: 1 trade
* Blue: 5 trades
* Dark Red: 10 trades
* Green: 20 trades
* Purple: 50 trades
* Bright Red: Retired Moderator
* Gold: Moderator





**How do we get flair?**

We'll need a couple pieces of information from you to update your flair successfully.

**A permanent link to your Steam profile. You can find this link on:**
                 
* [SteamRep](http://steamrep.com/)
* Enter your Profile Name.
* Find the line that begins with *steamID64*. This is the URL you need.

*(Please note that providing this information is optional. If you don't want your Steam profile linked from your flair

**To change or receive flair you MUST click [this link](http://x.bluesl.net/FlairUpgrade).**

----


**Proof of your completed trades.**

If you already have flair

If you are getting flair for the first time

**Please note that by completed trades we mean links to your confirmed trades in the successful trade list of the month
        
**We accept trades from the following subreddits:**
            
* [/r/SteamGameSwap](http://www.reddit.com/r/steamgameswap)
* [/r/gameswap](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap)

----
**Once again to change or receive flair you MUST click [this link](http://x.bluesl.net/FlairUpgrade).**

Note that posting in the completed-trades thread **WILL NOT GET YOU FLAIR AUTOMATICALLY**. You **MUST** follow these directions to receive flair.

A month before that i traded for a BF3 key for 2 bills hats which i had worked so hard for getting and EA removed that game from my account because the guy who sold me the key made a chargeback on his cradit card

* The two traders give the items they've agreed to trade to the middleman

**When should I ask for a middleman?**

* In case of any problem occurs -- the cd-key is invalid

**Who should I ask to be a middleman in one of my trades?**

Hey SGS. I've been trading off and on for about a year now. However, and I have been scammed multiple times for around $100 worth of games. Maybe I'm too trusting, too nice, or just a straight up idiot, but whatever the reason is, I'm turning into a scammer magnet.

Dear Members

Over the holidays we had a few problems with our site that affected some of you who bought or tried to buy the Bethesda New Year Collection and the Borderlands 2 Four-Pack.

We mistakenly advertised these packs at a price much lower than intended.

Many customers were quick to purchase the bundles at these low prices

What does this mean for you?

If you have managed to access at least one serial key
This means that we were able to complete your order. As difficult as it is for us

If you have not managed to access any of the games
This means that we were not able to complete your order due to technical difficulties

We want to apologize for these mistakes and the amount of time it has taken to resolve everything. It is possible that there are some who may be “stuck in the middle” and we would like to direct them to our support team so we can help you individually. Please be aware that due to the above issues

We hope that you can be pleased with the resolution of these issues,False,,t5_2skv6,False,,tier5,t3_164j6p

People like royceee have sold hundreds of Dead Island keys for paypal or other games and now he has changed his steam address and made his new profile private. It used to be steamcommunity.com/id/royceee but now it doesn't exist (EDIT: now he has linked to one of his alt accounts). I called him out in my history along with several other people on SPUF who knew what he was doing. His name is royceee on the Steam forums and that is where he sold most of his illegal copies http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2391919&amp;page=39. He is royceee on reddit too. He lied so many times while acting like a nice guy I am so pissed right now.

http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/o7f45/psa_watch_out_for_scammers_trying_to_flog_off/

edit: He just made his profile public again since he realized he can't hide. He blames his ""supplier"" which is actually fkn0wned but he will keep lying like he has done for the last several months, he is just trying to buy time while thinking of a different way to get away with all of the cash and games and items he has traded illegal Dead Island keys for. I can't begin to detail the web of lies this guy has told people in order to make money. If steam support receives several reports, maybe they will do something about it. He is trying to sell his Dead Island keys from his alt account which is private. http://tf2tp.com/profile.php?profile=76561197980701348   His latest post from 2/16 links to his alt now, saying he wants a Bills hat for each Dead Island copy. A Valve account on SPUF shut down his main selling thread long ago and warned him not to do it but he has continued to do it, only more on other forums since then. If Steam doesn't ban him, I'd say you can get away with anything.

edit: Annnnnd now his profile is private again. 

edit: And the lies continue. He says that his supplier took his website down and disconnected the phone. He has no supplier
 . Royceee says he sold the copies at or below cost. Nope, got tons of TF2 keys/buds/bills and sold THOSE for paypal, and also sold game after game for paypal. He has made thousands of dollars off of this scam and now he is saying he LOST money? This kid is despicable. At first, after people found his hidden/changed profile, he said he would refund everyone but he needed to wait to hear from steam first. Now he says, ""I have suffered massive losses from this crisis. [...] For you guys, I will be gathering what I still have left and try my best to give you a refund."" He has hundreds of sales JUST counting Dead Island for crying out loud. He says it was the fault of his supplier, but he wants records from those who purchased from him so he can prove to the CC that his imaginary ""supplier"" is a fraud?

**EDITED IN** from a [comment below](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/1bkc6o/psa_company_of_heroes_tales_of_valor_keys_are/c97ilcg?context=3)

&gt; PWYW bundle keys are not allowed following a community consensus from a poll about a year ago. Individuals may have voted for it for different reasons

&gt; 1. Some feel it takes advantage of devs who are already deeply discounting their games by including them in a PWYW bundle.

&gt; 2. Some feel it takes advantage of inexperienced traders who don't know about bundles

&gt; 3. Some feel it opens the forum up to too much ""key spam"" with people offering the same extremely cheap keys on everyone's threads.

&gt; 4. It is against the TOS of Humble Bundle, but some may want to respect the bundle distributors / devs wishes in this matter. This is (presumably) the reason why, until recently, Humble Bundle only gave you one key for the entire bundle. (I assume the reason they stopped is that it became a hassle for Valve to add new CDR database entries for their bundles, which would also often lead to the bundle contents getting leaked early when people spotted the CDR entries; officially Humble's policy is still one-bundle-for-one-end-user, no sharing).

&gt; I don't agree with every one of these, /r/gamesell or other sites like steamtrades.com, but they are responsible for double checking the rules of those places themselves.",,False,,t5_2skv6,,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/1bkc6o/psa_company_of_heroes_tales_of_valor_keys_are/

1337701262.0,tzdeh,[PSA] How to value your TF2 Items,drgncabe,30,4,32,"So

Examples of these would be;

* Deus Ex: Human Revolution items (7+ keys)
* Bill's hat (8-9 keys)
* Genuine Scrap Pack (1-2 keys)

(For reference; TF2 Mann Co keys sell on the trading market for from **$1.35 - $1.50/key^1**

* Not all TF2 Promo items are worth a ton
* Keep in mind that this mostly applies to promos, even promos, you might have to 'overpay' their general TF2 value for a game unless it's a very sought after promo. For example, *Big Kill* from Sam &amp; Max is worth a ***lot*** more (14-15 keys) than the *Machina* promo from Deus Ex (~2 refined). As always, YMMV. 
* Tip from [mszu](http://www.reddit.com/user/mszu): *""If you are offering up a backpack full of random cheap stranges, hope no one minds)

**So how do I look up my value?**  
Well, It may not be 100% perfect but it seems to be more accurate than some of the other offerings and it gives you a good good place to start with your items value. 

***Information from [ruinernix](http://www.reddit.com/user/ruinernix), but that is a lot of work. Some hats are not priced yet, but we're working on it. You can vote on prices that you feel are not correct and we look at them once enough votes have been received. There is also a spreadsheet view, so you can see all prices at a glance.""*

Another way is to check each item individually using the following sites;

* [TF2 Trends pricing guide](http://www.tf2trends.com/)
* [TF2 pricing spreadsheet for hats and items](http://www.tf2pricingguide.blogspot.com/)
* [TF2 Warehouse](http://tf2wh.com)

The longer way (meaning it takes more research) is to check out the following locations to see what other people are trading for.

* /r/tf2trade 
* [TF2 Outpost](http://www.tf2outpost.com)
* [TF2 Trading Post](http://tf2tp.com/)

I hope this helps others

**^1** Useful info from [orijinal](http://www.reddit.com/user/orijinal): $1.50 per key is about the max you can hope for. It's easy to find keys for $1.40 and sometimes you can find them for as low as $1.30.

**What's 2.44 Refined mean
Just in-case you are unsure
*2.44 Refined* = *2 Refined, Scout, etc...) to make a scrap, 3 scrap to make a reclaimed and 3 reclaimed to make a refined. Here's some additional info on the [TF2 Wiki crafting](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Crafting) entry.

This script is a fork of [the one zedadex made] (http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/112566) for /r/tf2trade. I loved that it provided so many links based off a SteamID alone

I first modified it to leave flair tiers intact, skim TF2 backpack value, check SteamRep, add as a friend.

1336810055.0,tjfyu,[PSA] Region locked steam gifts,jtraub,33,9,28,"Valve has introduced regional restrictions to some purchases from Steam Store.  
-------------

Previously they stated, there were several solid confirmations that restrictions exist.

---------------------------------------

Right now you should be aware of following gifts.
-------------

[Max payne 3 Pre order 1 (CIS) - sub id 14524](http://cdr.thebronasium.com/sub/14524)
The gift has following parameter in its cdr record: 
&gt; onlyallowrunincountries = AM AZ BY GE KZ KG MD RU TJ TM UZ UA LV LT EE

which means it can not be runned outside [CIS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Independent_States#Membership) countries
  

[Max payne 3 Pre order 1 (RU) - sub id 14623](http://cdr.thebronasium.com/sub/14623)
with parameter
&gt; onlyallowrunincountries = RU

which means that it will be playable only inside Russia. 
  
  

Also note, but Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 form this gift will contain russian language pack ONLY. It was available to purchase in Russia till 12 of May. From this moment only restricted version (sub 14524) is available for Russians.

### 5+ Trade Flair

You might have noticed that most blue (1+ trade) flairs have turned gray. That's to make room for our new 5+ trade tier, and your account **must** be at least 30 days old.

Remember, [message the moderators.](http://go.blueshiftlabs.net/FlairUpgrade)

### Age and flair requirements reduced

The age requirements to receive red, the karma requirements for flair are now **combined karma** (link + comment), not just link karma.

Here's the new flair requirements:

Flair Tier | Color | Minimum account age | Minimum combined karma
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
1+|Gray|None (3+ if under 30 days)|None
5+|Blue|30 days|None
10+|Red|**3 months** (was 6)|200
20+|Green|**6 months** (was 12)|400
50+|Purple|**6 months** (was 12)|400

## New Trade Restrictions
***

### Accounts

If you want to trade a LoL, you must have **blue flair (5+ trades)**.

***Steam accounts may not be traded under any circumstances.***

### Paypal

Trading for Paypal now requires **both sides of the trade have blue flair (5+ trades).**

***
## Removed Trade Restrictions
***

### Humble Bundles (and other name-your-own-price bundles)

Humble Bundles, and other forms of name-your-own-price bundle are now **allowed**, subject to these restrictions:

1. Bundles must be above the average price.
    
    For Humble Bundles

    For IndieRoyale bundles

    For other name-your-own-price bundles

    **Proof of purchase price must be provided for all bundles.**

2. Bundles must be complete gift URLs - **no partial bundles.**

3. Bundles are subject to the same restrictions as all other code trades (must have gray flair or higher).

### Dota 2 and Dead Island

Dota 2 and Dead Island are now allowed. **Proof of purchase / valid key ownership must be provided.**

***How to update your flair:***

We'll need a couple pieces of information from you to update your flair successfully. We'll need:

* A *permanent* link to your Steam profile. You can find this link on:
    * [SteamRep](http://steamrep.com/) 
        * Enter your Profile Name.
        * Find the line that begins with ""steamID64"". This is the URL you need.
    * [SteamIDFinder](http://steamidfinder.com/)
        * Enter your profile link (you can get this by going to your Community page in Steam
        * Right click your profile picture (to the left) and copy the URL.
        * **Don't give us your steamID32** (the one that looks like **STEAM_X:Y:ZZZZZZZZ**) - give us the URL of the link attached to your profile picture (it should look like `http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/7656119xxxxxxxxxx`).


    **Don't give us your custom URL** (anything containing /id/). We need your permanent URL (the one containing /profiles/).

    *Please note that providing this information is optional.* If you don't want your Steam profile linked from your flair

* Proof of your completed trades. 
    * *If you already have flair
    * If you are getting flair for the first time
    We accept trades from the following subreddits:
        * /r/SteamGameSwap
        * /r/gameswap
        * /r/SteamTrade
        * /r/SteamTrading

### To change your flair

**Please note that posting in the completed-trades thread WILL NOT GET YOU FLAIR AUTOMATICALLY. You MUST follow these directions to receive flair.**

*Note that due to the width of the flair, look at any posts or comments that you've made here.*

Otherwise, but nonetheless he seemed to solve it.




Thanks for all the support and help in trying to solve my pitiful problem. My advice is that you disregard how many trades a person a has. This one had 70+ trade and still pulled out the biggest scam on the subreddit apparently. Look through a traders history comments and see what they're like. If they post reasonable offers, then they have some humanity in them and can be trusted. Also ask other big traders like /u/Kataki ComputerNerd and a whole lot more you probably accumulated.

1348441029.0,10d2yp,[PSA] Scammer avoidance guide,Kasuli,26,3,15,"After being scammed yesterday due to my extremely bad habit of trusting people

**Avoiding scammers**


Guidelines:

1. *It doesn't have to be a new account.* 
Many scammers will do some 1:1 Steam trades on /r/SteamGameSwap and give you links to completed ones. Trading one game for another of relatively same value gets you a great illusion of credibility.

2. *Don't blindly trust Steam Rep*. Now I didn't even check it beforehand (I did everything wrong

3. *If it's a key

4. *Take screenshots*. This won't really help you avoid scamming, if someone takes your hard-earned goods, you will want justice. 

5. *Need-to-know basis*. Don't give out any information your trading partner doesn't need. Obviously no credit card details, you'll avoid getting your e-mail on spamlists and such.

Red flags:


*Keep in mind

1. *Temporary e-mail account*. Obvious temporary accounts are one good indicator you might be dealing with a scammer. A bunch of numbers at the end

2. *Oh

3. *You're taking too long

4. *I don't trust middlemen*. Get. The. Fuck. Out.


**If you get scammed**

1. *Don't think about personal retaliation*. Putting the e-mail on spamlists won't do any good

2. *Get him banned*. Hard. Here's where those screenshots you took come in handy. You have a buttload of evidence. If you screwed up

3. *Get him more banned*. It doesn't have to stay within where ever you traded with him. Get him banned from every trading media you possibly can - all Steam trading groups he belongs to, no trading group is going to trust him.

4. *Be smarter next time*. This was a lesson - a tough one, you're going to find a direct Steam trade or buy from a proper reseller. Lose 40 bucks? Don't let it get you down, think about it this way - maybe without the experience you've gained, someone would've scammed you out of a hundred bucks a year from now.",,False,,False,t3_10d2yp

* Account age! Scammers often have older alts
* Game count (always be extra careful if they have ~50 games or less)
* Recently played time (this varies of course, either. Some may use alt accounts to ""idle"" in TF2 for item drops, etc.

In light of the events of the last week or so - more scam PSAs than I've seen in a while - I felt it might be good to start a weekly event to highlight a few tips to help safeguard your trades.  Yes, so we can all help each other out in some way, I'm sure.

Think of this as a place to ask your questions

I'm going to start by adding a piece from yesterday's middleman PSA that applies to the general idea of confirming the identity of other Steam users.

To verify the identity of a user and/or MM
--
1.  Click their avatar in the Steam chat window.  Don't bother with any links anybody sends you - *DO IT YOURSELF!*
2.  Copy their URL directly from your main Steam window where their profile should now be loaded (skip the next step if you are able to do this).
3.  If you don't see a URL - do this:  In the main Steam window
4.  Go to [steamrep.com](http://steamrep.com/) and paste the copied profile link into the search.
5.  NOW you can compare the page you have on SR to any (potentially false) links that may have been provided to you.  You can also state that you are going to take a moment to click a few of the quick search links on that person's SR page.  You can also ask that the MM PM you on reddit to verify that he/she is indeed one of the people listed in this thread.

The following steps are only for when things go awry.
--
1.  Should any step of verification fail or if anybody becomes too pushy - *BACK THE FUCK OUT IMMEDIATELY*.  There's rarely - if ever - a need to rush a trade.
2.  *DO NOT* close any chat windows - begin taking screenshots.  Capture as much as you can.
3.  Read this first:  http://forums.steamrep.com/threads/howto-report-a-scammer-look-at-acceptable-format-before-posting.51/
4.  Then report here:  http://forums.steamrep.com/forums/report/

ALWAYS report scammers - even if a person is already marked.  Some day
--

The other day a user was scammed, *that scammer was never reported on SR.*

YOU NEED TO REPORT YOUR OWN SCAMMERS

Other users should not have to file for you

I'm going to post now and let additional advice or questions show up

***

## Thread Formats
***
***
### Trade Threads
***

Trade threads follow this format:

**[H] Games

Some particulars:

* The spaces are important. These won't work:

    *[H]Stuff[W]Stuff*  
    *[H]Stuff [W]Stuff*

    Always make sure to put spaces **after [H]

* You have to use square brackets. These won't work:

    *(H) Stuff (W) Other stuff*  
    *{H} Stuff {W} Other stuff*

    Always use **[square brackets]** around [H] and [W].

* Put the parts of your post in the right order. This won't work:

    [W] Other stuff [H] Stuff

    Remember that **[H] comes before [W].**

* Separate parts of your post correctly. These won't work:

    *[H] Cool stuff &amp; Dota 2 [W] Offers*
    *[H] Cool stuff and Dota 2 [W] Offers*

    Always **use commas or plus signs** to separate individual parts of your post.

* Remember to **put some number of games in your title.**

    If you have a large inventory, try to have at least **three games** listed in your title. This helps people who are scanning threads.

Trade threads are by far the most common type of thread

***
### PSA Threads
***

PSA threads are ""public service announcements"" - non-trading posts that convey information that other traders should know.

PSA threads should be formatted as follows:

**[PSA] Title of your post**

PSA threads can be posted by any user - but please keep non-trading-relevant discussion in its appropriate subreddit.

PSA threads are indicated by a **yellow exclamation point icon.**

***
### Announcement Threads
***

Announcement threads contain information about rules changes, while old announcements will be moved to the Announcement section of the sidebar.

Announcement threads are **reserved for moderator use.** AutoModerator will remove announcement posts not posted by moderators.

Announcement threads follow this format:

**[ANNOUNCEMENT] Post title**

Announcement threads are indicated by a **yellow exclamation point icon**

***
### Giveaway Threads
***

Giveaway threads are threads where generous Redditors can give games to others! Giveaways are subject to whatever rules may be set by the game giver. Please confirm giveaways just like any other trade - they are counted toward flair for the giver

Giveaway threads follow this format:

**[GIVEAWAY] Games being given away**

Giveaways are indicated by a **green plus icon.**

***
### Closed Threads
***

Closed threads are threads that have completed. Thread posters will have ""close thread"" links that they can use to close threads.

Closed threads are indicated by a **red do-not-enter icon.**

Note that closing a thread is purely cosmetic - other users are still able to add comments to closed threads.

Also note that closed threads, are browsing from the front page, or are browsing from a mobile app, you may see closed threads appear as normal threads with an NSFW tag.

***
***
## SGS Glossary
***
***

There's also been some confusion about what certain terms mean

* **Key**

    A CD key

    *To avoid confusing AutoModerator

* **TF2 keys**

    Distinct from unqualified ""keys"", and are not subject to flair restrictions.

    *To avoid AutoModerator confusion

* **Steam Wallet**

    ""$X Steam Wallet"" is shorthand for ""Any game or combination of games, and trades them through the trading window.

    *Because this is a Steam Trading transaction

* **Accounts**

    An account is **anything you log in to.** This includes accounts for WoW, as well as accounts for game services such as Origin, and even established accounts for non-gaming services.

    **Note that due to the easy ability to recover accounts in most cases

    When trading for accounts

Hope this helps clear up any confusion you might have.

Happy trading

&gt;Remember that fraudulent purchases are very common

&gt;Steam does try to help people that get affected by such game copies:
&gt;
&gt;https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9958-MJDG-3003

&gt;
&gt;**********************
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;This would have been avoided the following way:
&gt;
&gt;Never trade for a game without giving something back for it. **NEVER**.
&gt;
&gt;* Before gifting the game
&gt;
&gt;* Trade the copy of the game for the items. 
&gt;
&gt;This way
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;If you are buying games while paying with cash, if a sold game is revoked, you're basically on your own.
&gt;
&gt;Since all cash sales **should** involve middlemen
&gt;
&gt;* The game seller sends the game to the middleman.
&gt;
&gt;* You
&gt;
&gt;* When the payment is done
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;This way, you can work something out with the seller and middleman to protect yourself in a similar way. 
&gt;
&gt;******************************
&gt;
&gt;The best way not to get scammed trading for games is to only buy from trustworthy traders that bought the games themselves.
&gt;
&gt;**TL;DR** Never trade Steam games without having something on the other side of the trade window of the same value

How exactly does it come into play within this subreddit and when applying for flair?   

Personally
I understand that karma signifies that the user is active on reddit, yet thought out and rational responses on a less popular subreddit can reap 10 upvotes, at best. I'd much rather trade with the person that didn't post on /r/circlejerk, but if a karma requirement barred the rational person from trading Paypal, for example, I wouldn't have the option. Yes, the trade is still getting done (in this example, but the point still stands.  
I think the karma requirement shouldn't be in place for flair.

1370447679.0,1fq6vt,[PSA] Unofficial /r/SGS survey results,warheat1990,23,3,77,"Hello

From my PSA few days ago.
http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/1fc6se/psa_unofficial_feedback_thread_poll_inside_info/  
  
I've got 117 participants
  
I'll answer all questions/feedback later(any mod feel free to respond in these questions if needed). Keep in mind this is not official /r/SGS survey.  
  
**WARNING : Wall of Text. ** 
  
Here is the results.  
  
**Q1. Do you think grey flair is really needed for keys/code trade?**  
  
[Click](http://i.imgur.com/LaOviHe.png)  
  
Comments from peoples who chose ""Other"":  
  
1. Everyone should be able to trade key codes but 1 person must be grey and the non-flair goes first.  
  
2. Blue flair. It is easy enough for a scammer to get the 3 trades. If we can get them to have 5 + trades before trading keys or codes
  
3. Either flair or established Reddit and Steam accounts should be sufficient. If you don't have no confirmed flair, 300 game Steam account then keys should be allowed. My vote would be 30-60 days, 100+ karma Reddit Account and 50-100 games Steam Account, OR confirmed grey flair.  
  
4. Move it up to blue.  
  
5. I think you should have at least a blue fair to trade keys/codes  
  
6. Let the user take the risk  
  
7. Should be based on steam account mainly (perhaps a game minimum limit such as 200+ wityh 1-2 years)  
  
8. People should be allowed to trade keys if they're A) Redditor for a few months or B) can provide proof that they own the key.  
  
9. I think anyone should be allowed to trade as long as their steam account is linked (which is required now anyway). However
  
10. Both grey flair + 30-60 days for codes.  
  
11. Make it blue flair for keys/code.  
  
12. The account should have to be 30-60
  
**Q2. Do you think blue flair for both party is really needed for paypal trade?**  
  
[Click](http://i.imgur.com/nHWbVQZ.png)  
  
Comments from peoples who chose ""Other"":  
  
1. Make it only for buyer due to they can reclaim their money due to getting bank to cancel. Lower flair goes first.  
  
2. I think people can decide what they're trafding for. But I think you guys must courage people with higher trades to not go first.  
  
3. Same as above
  
4. Upgrade it to minimum red only. This will cut down on a lot of newbie paypal only posts and clean the sub up.  
  
5. It should be used as a recommended guideline but not enforced.  
  
6. Only active reddit accounts in good standing should be allowed to sell via Paypal. Anyone should be able to buy using Paypal.  
  
7. Should be based on steam account mainly (perhaps a game minimum limit such as 200+ with 1-2 years)  
  
8. red flair should be required for the seller only  
  
9. It should be required by the seller only but to become a seller should be made much more difficult as to avoid scammers. maybe make paypal sellers require 20 confirmed trades  
  
10. The 3rd option
  
11. No. Flair basically makes it so people with less common sense have a baseline to judge their trading partner. It's also quite inhibiting to those who either don't care about flair or have rep somewhere else. Make it a suggestion
  
**Q3. On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being bad and 5 being good. What score will you give /r/SGS compared to other trading community?**  

[Click](http://i.imgur.com/gEByfcs.png)  
  
Comments:  
  
1. It's a nice alternative
  
2. Because your /r/SGS is allways flooded with some [PSA] shit
  
3. Would be 5 if there wasn't so much backseat trading. Too many people try to enforce their idea of what a game is worth on other people.  
  
4. I really like it. Though I've made some paypal trades without having blue flair and wish I was able to increase my flair through these successful transactions.  
  
5. Compared to other trading communities
  
6. I came from SourceOP
  
7. Better than most
  
8. SGS used to be the best trading community, sharking, bundle key spam, and similar posts that have brought down the quality substantially. Without more active moderation and a deeper line in the sand against the lower quality aspects of trading, it will soon devolve into the same state as every other, once nice, trading forum. New users should be welcomed and helped fit into the community, as has been done in many other places.  
  
9. The mods are working hard and doing the best they can
  
10. I have been a Reddit lurker for many years, I felt as safe as you can feel when trading online) and I instantly subscribed to the subreddit and am sharing it with all of my friends and my gaming community members. Thanks for putting in time, all of you, to make this place worth something!  
  
11. Very outdated and clunky. Having to manually find your trade comments and request flair is annoying. High flair users may have an unfair advantage over lower flair users since the trade count is displayed during interaction. Maybe there could be a ""in good standing"" status after 3-5 trades which is displayed instead of flair. Users could then optionally view the user's trade count/flair by clicking their flair  
  
12. You guys are doing a great job. A lot of users here add a sense of urgency because of a great deal they can't grab up
  
13. Rules are a little strict at the moment, very good community with active mods and friendly/informative members.  
  
14. I have used Steamtrades and TF2 Outpost in the past but SGS is my favourite. I feel it has a good atmosphere and the mods do a really good job!H However
  
15. I have little experience with other trading communities
  
16. It's not invulnerable to scammers.  
  
17. information is overwhelming for new traders - rules arent clear  
  
18. I dont use the other ones :P  
  
**Q4. On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being bad and 5 being good. Do you feel we've done well moderating this subreddit?**  
  
[Click](http://i.imgur.com/OBQ5Yj6.png)  
  
Comments:  
  
1. 8 Pages behind
  
2. Normally great
  
3. mods are active
  
4. Moderation is perfect
  
5. As the user base has grown, but if current mods can not, or do not have the time to sufficiently moderate the community properly then perhaps it is worth adding more to the list, or if Reddit allows it at least some lower level Janitors to help keep the posts in line.  
  
6. Keep it up. You should get rewarded for your efforts.  
  
7. Too strict.  
  
8. I think the moderators do a fine job
  
9. There is a lot of demand and mod-mail and as far as I am concerned
  
10. Thanks for keeping SGS a safe community for trading!  
  
11. The mods do a really good job enforcing the rules and educating the new guys. However
  
12. You have done exceptionally well with warning others of bad traders and scammers.  
  
13. Half the day is moderated for me so there ok
  
14. Flair assignment has gotten quicker since new mods were added, there seems to be massive disagreement and/or confusion about what the actual rules of the subreddit are among the mods, especially the newer mods. I have seen one mod basically make up rules on more than one occasion.  
  
15. Many of the mods are either completely inactive or have a history of idiotic behavior.  
  
16. Don't just remove threads/comments that are breaking the rules
  
17. Keep up the good work.  
  
18. I still feel like more mods are needed. This is a huge subreddit that has very heavy regulation requirements. There are long periods of time where no mods are around or available  
  
19. The moderators are very good :)  
  
20. Mods are great/friendly but far more are needed  
  
**Q5. What should we (mods) do to improve /r/SGS? (Optional)**  
  
1. Get more mods to assign flairs

2. Possibly have a list of (current?) scammers for the newcomers
  
3. -
  
1. As I have seen many trades are related to Dota 2 / TF2 Keys
  
1. nothing
  
1. It's great! Nothing right now. Thanks for this awesome community!
  
1. Stop acting like nazi's.
  
1. Don't now how you would do it or if there is a guide already; but helping people identify an impersonator or a well known trader. Also
  
1. give out more free stuff and eat some more babies
  
1. Keep on doin what you're doing.
  
1. No much
  
1. I think it's fine how it is.
  
1. Need more mods for when help is needed. It's too often that illegal stuff goes through because no mod was online
  
1. It's hard for starters to begin trading when the mods close your thread very quickly.
  
1. Different colored PSA tags.
  
1. More mods for flair.
  
1. Flair requests are a bottleneck. Find out a way to automate them. Russian traders are also somewhat sparse.
  
1. Sign on a few more mods or janitors to clean up indie key offers.
  
1. Crack down on newbie users. They're the worst.
  
1. Prevent scammers from being able to PM
  
1. Notihng
  
1. you are doing a great job!
  
1. Allow bundle key trading
  
1. Fix steambot so you can unlink accounts. I accidentally linked an alt reddit account and not my main with 5+ trade flair.
  
1. Perhaps select new moderators who have more free time.
  
1. mods that care about updating flair in a timely fashion
  
1. CSS Upgrades. Make it super slick.
  
1. Remind people that you mod for free
  
1. Create more ""state of subreddit"" discussion posts (perhaps once a month) to get community thoughts.
  
1. I don't think you should do anything really. You moderate the subreddit for free and I think you do a very good job considering the circumstances. I am also happy that I have been seeing a few ""potential scammer"" PSA's. This to me is a lot better than ""I just got scammed by..."" PSA's. It's nice to see everyone looking out for each other.
  
1. More staff to moderate/flair requests (mornings uk time seems to be no one moderating posts) Weekly events with the community couldn't hurt
  
1. Cut down on the number of PSAs. Seems to be an *awful* lot of them.
  
1. Flair doesn't make any sense except to maybe protect users against themselves. It works in the physical trading subreddits since somebody always has to go first
  
1. Color coding for announcements!
  
1. make an auto bot for flair requests
  
1. Get more/better mods
  
1. Steam game swap should be for any steam games/keys indie games included. Call it AAA game swap or something if you arent allowed to trade steam keys regardless of the game type
  
1. Automate Flair and recruit more mods.
  
1. You are doing a great job!
  
1. The faq and the rules are in dire need of a revision. The number of mods doesn't nearly reflect the actual number of active mods. Retire those who haven't been active in a long while.
  
1. If the flair system is to be used
  
1. Force people signing up with the SteamBot to read some vital rules for the subreddit. Perhaps show each key rule a screen at a time with a timer on the ""next"" button to make sure they are actually reading and acknowledging the rules.
  
1. I can't think of anything other than just being able to go through flair requests faster. I've already got purple flair so I'm not complaining
  
1. Reorganize the sidebar and wikis
do more to eliminate rude traders and trolls  
not allow people to game the system for karma  
be more clear about what constitutes a trade and put it on the rule list  
maybe make specific psa for scammers and must have mod approval to post as to not slander innocent traders  
make middlemen more available somehow since mods arent around all the time  
add higher tiers of flair beyond 50 trades  
crack down in illegitimate trades in the confirmed trades
  
1. make the flair system easier (if possible)
  
1. Endorse common sense. Endorse reading guides and tips. Do it more openly and more often. It's really too bad you can't make people pass an entrance exam.
  
1. Make the rules more apparent to new users.
  
1. More mods
  
**Q6. Aside from waiting for flair upgrade(I know it sucks you have to wait that long to get a flair upgrade), etc. (Optional)**  
  
1. People basically treating you like you don't know anything when you have low flair
  
1. Only people treating it like a heavy job - my experience has been very positive
  
1. -
  
1. Nothing yet. SGS rocks. Even I got my flair on the same day I sent the message. So no complain :D
  
1. Fucking downvotes from random retarded people and retarded comments on my trade topics. How i should do some deal because its good. And all sort of random shits that happens on reddit as allways.
  
1. I'd be proud to say that I am very satisfied and happy with r/SGS's performance so far :) Thanks again!
  
1. I made a successful trade (All I had to trade were keys, confirmed the trade, everything. NOPE NO FLAIR FOR YOU BCUZ U TRADED KEY UR 1ST TIME. I don't understand how trading a key, and having it confirmed is any different than another trade. They both serve the same purpose. I verified I wasn't an asshole.
  
1. Nothing really to write about. Occasionally that rude person.
  
1. someone didn't agree with my opinion and i was sad
  
1. Never had an issue
  
1. When I first joined I remember times I got taken advantage of due to my limited knowledge on how /r/sgs actually worked
  
1. Too many scammers.
  
1. Mod was being very rude. I don't mind too much
  
1. Nothing. :) You guys do a great job!
  
1. Scammed by multiple people and not having allowed to do much about it (except warn others and putting on steamrep.)
  
1. Shittiest was being called a scammer, and everything's better now.
  
1. Scammed early on
  
1. getting sharked many times (my fault I was ignorant about games values)
  
1. Notihng
  
1. the worst that is happened to me
  
1. Non-mods telling me I'm breaking a rule.
  
1. My first two trade encounter on SGS were scammers. They nearly convinced me out of my games but luckily I backed out in the end. ( They were later confirmed scammers )
  
1. Loosing 100+ karma in a single trade thread
  
1. No complaints really but SGS is far from my primary trading community.
  
1. I havent been scammed on here
  
1. No complaints
  
1. Nothing... yet!
  
1. I am happy to say that I have never been in a bad situation. Everyone I have traded with has been really nice and trades have been very easy for me
  
1. Every situation I have had on this subreddit has left me satisfied.
  
1. 24 hour waiting for posting even 22 or so where you have some flex between times would be great
  
1. Arbitrarily deciding that certain things don't count for flair
  
1. Great experiences so far. Love you guys.
  
1. people ruining other peoples trades with price-checks and too many scammers
  
1. I've had no troubles with it so far.
  
1. Mostly it was brought upon myself by my own ignorance, which led to a number of people berating me for my short temper when I reacted violently to other people pointing out that I could've bought it myself. Like I said, I basically deserved the backlash for being an idiot, but that's the worst thing that's ever happened to me in /r/SGS
  
1. I was downvote bombed on all of my posts from a guy for letting people in his thread know how to get the deal he was getting (cheaper wallet funds)
  
1. I think the scammer PSA rules need a closer look. I see some people really going off on something really small and labeling someone as a scammer and posting about it.
  
1. none
  
1. Missing out on the TF2 key for Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon trades :P
  
1. Haven't really run into any problems other than the tempers of other redditors.
  
1. people being rude and talking bad about other traders without provocation -
  
1. getting a trade and figuring out it was extremely lowballed and I got ripped off... (but never scammed)
  
1. Never been in one
  
1. Some idiot pretending I scammed him

Dusty

Here are 
screenshots of their profiles showing they are mutual friends. [Kenji's](http://i.imgur.com/FohIXOl.png) shows 1 common friend and [Dustys](http://i.imgur.com/HSjffEU.png) has Kenji listed in friends tab. 

When I messaged both of them they both started off the conversation the same exact way which is what first caught my attention. They were both offering 3 Arma Alpha Lite KEYS and wanted a tradable game in return. Kenji specifically asked for Sanctum and I think at one point Mass Effect. Both of them also refused to comment on the reddit trade thread I made earlier which was another red flag. After playing along for a while I eventually accused Kenji of trying to scam and he said he wasn't then he left the conversation. I told Dusty both him and Kenji were coming off as scammers and he never replied. I'm not sure if they just didn't understand the value of arma alpha lite but they were both behaving suspiciously.

In this thread I am going to explain what they are and what you get from having one. Basically its just a watered down version of the Alpha in its current stage and you do NOT get the full game.

Here is a screenshot directly from the Arma 3 website that shows what you get.

http://speedcap.net/sharing/files/4f/d5/4fd5477ed16c8528364e9f7796d35399.png

Here is a direct link to the page that shows what you get with each version too: http://www.arma3.com/buy

A few key points about the Lite:

* It does not contain Multiplayer!

* It does not give you the Beta or Full game!

* You do not have access to the Modding features.

* You have a limited version of the editor.

* It lasts between 14 March - 18 June.

* You receive another alpha lite key for you to then pass on. (Chain Effect)



I hope this thread has helped clear things up for people and now you know if you engage in a trade for one you know what you are receiving.

Why do people downvote trade offers?

[Only downvote if it's spam or off-topic.](http://i.imgur.com/VMOsrjj.png)

Some redditors in /r/SGS fail to understand the concept of downvoting. I've seen random trade offers get downvoted if it wasn't the best offer in the world, sometimes I miss it.

I want people to feel confident in making offers (as long as it's not Dota 2)

&gt;Get/give Dota 2

If urgent, personally PM me or another mod.",rikker_,19,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/15tcsw/announcement_please_dont_make_psas_unless_you_are/

Hi all.

So we just had a bit of an ugly incident. A user was the subject of a PSA accusing him of scamming. He did some things that made him appear suspicious

The user had created a new Reddit and Steam account to do a giveaway, he verified his primary Reddit account with me, including links to past giveaways on /r/PlayItForward, and I was able to locate his pending flair request (which is the reason he had confirmed trades but no flair). The request was about 3 days old, and near the top of the backlog queue to be dealt with. This stuff was all easily verified and the user cooperated with me.

Point is this: PSAs are okay to warn people about actual confirmed scammers. I don't mind the PSAs

That said

Things took a sour turn when someone posted his Google account info

Everybody screwed up here in some way -- moderators don't process flair quickly enough, and posting anyone's personal info of any kind is straight out of bounds.

Your vigilance and protectiveness of the community is much appreciated,False,,t5_2skv6,1357111571.0,,mod-rikker,t3_15tcsw

There's the person's permanent profile. This guy is a POSSIBLE scammer

http://i.imgur.com/PUD30RZ.png

I blacked out his e-mail because I don't think I can share personal info on here.

So here's what happened: I had a spare copy of Witcher 2 that I wanted to do for 5$ Paypal. He said he would do it, so I did so. However, as soon as I mentioned I wanted him to fill the invoice he unfriended me. So while I am not 100% sure what happened, I think I can guess:

1) He wanted me to feel like because I sent him an invoice he had to pay it

OR 

2) He wanted the personal details (Contact Info

Thankfully I was not scammed this time

Drunken F00l  	 12 hours ago

Changes to maximum listing price and fees
We've changed the maximum wallet balance and also changed the maximum listing price. The maximum wallet balance is now $500 (or 320 GBP,500 Rubles, 1000 Brazilian Reals), but the maximum listing price is 80% of the max wallet balance ( $400 -- twice what it was before). We've set the maximum wallet balance greater than the maximum listing price to help ensure people can purchase all listings regardless of currency.

We've also had to make a change to the way the fees work to better account for the two different fees. Before, we apply the fees completely separately, each rounded down with a minimum of $0.01. Yes, this means the minimum purchase price of an item increased to $0.03 (from $0.02), but this also means a lot of items are actually cheaper since each fee is rounded down separately. We've got some ideas about how we can let people sell entire stacks of items at a time which will help make the fee a smaller percentage of the entire cost of cheap items.

*Note: Someone [asked if the mods could do this](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/ou4xm/announcement_suggestions_thread_post_any/c416mhs) in the Suggestions thread

Have you ever tried to go to a user's Steam profile using the link in their flair

**addendum:** Firefox users have the privilege of being able to simply triple-click on the profile URL to highlight the link, let's say you want to save some clicks in the long run.

I did it about twenty times tonight and, [there is](http://i.imgur.com/GjMi9.png)!

---

**addendum x2:** I feel like an idiot.

I thought I'd searched to see if anyone had posted this before

I'm keeping the rest of this up as a monument to my shame, the clever ba- guy.

WHY DIDN'T I SEE THAT POST? ::weeps::

---
First

**I shouldn't have to say this

* If you use Chrome or Opera (which supports Greasemonkey scripts natively) or have Greasemonkey installed, and will work on all kinds of links (HTTP/S, mailto, etc). 
    * If you block Javascript on reddit
* If you just want an extension
* Likewise
    * I prefer the Greasemonkey scripts

---

Next

* Chrome users will be prompted to install the scripts or Clickable Links as soon as it's finished downloading. It'll ask for access to all websites; realize that it needs this access to be able to see the HTML code on the page and search for text strings that look like URLs.
* Firefox users using Greasemonkey should follow the normal instructions to install the scripts. If you install the extension
* Opera users... are on their own; sorry, as long as you figure out how to install them.
* IE/Safari users should've gotten the hint earlier that I have no idea what options are available for you

---

Once you've installed either of the scripts or one of the extensions

For those who want to see what these extensions and scripts do

All flair links should now be clickable; no more dragging to highlight

**edit:** Added some images to depict what happens when you have these extensions installed; check 'em [here](http://imgur.com/a/ivoXl). Also, hey, maybe there's an easier way to do this. :) I thought I'd share.

**edit x2:** Added the addendum above regarding triple-clicking in Firefox. Too bad I'm a Chrome user.

Make sure that you report from their Steam profile page _and_ go to SteamRep.com and report them.

Well, he's banned from Steam entirely, losing all the ill-gotten games. I'm not happy that I won't get my game back, but I'm happy that the 15 year old Australian guy is now banned from that account. Sure, he'll probably create another account but at least he knows he's been kissed and lost _everything_... he had a lot of games on that account, many more than were reported anywhere as being scammed. So, I hope he and his family, lost out on several thousand dollars worth of games.

Reports do work against scammers.

Remember:

A) Google search someone's name. Be thorough

B) Report on forums, games or items. Don't say ""nothing will happen"" and let it go because you can make something happen.

I know this isn't a great post that many of you want to see

I didn't claim/reveal my key from the 4-pack, I claimed a key and activated on Steam and that looks there to stay in my account.

So I think if you've claimed a key, you're getting a refund. If you received a gift and haven't received a key by now, you're not getting one. Anybody that has, is likely to keep it.

Hey all.

Just a friendly update/reminder thread. I sure hope you're reading this.

***First***:


PLEASE READ THE FAQ. It can be found here: [FaQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/quw61/announcement_faq_is_down_faq_inside/#from-tab)
And please re-read the sidebar again.

This is about requesting your flair. When doing it

**When you request it

***Third***

It's your job to report people who offer something who doesn't have sufficient flair to do so. We can't read everything. If you report something the more likely we can see it and remove it.

***Fourth***

They are in the form of steam keys so no need to be suspicious of steam tradable ones. There are legit ones out there in the form of steamkeys so just be safe and ask for proof.


I've also seen people trying to convince people to register it through some sort of VPN server. DO NOT do it. It is against steam policy and you risk getting your account banned. It is not worth the risk just to play a beta. Chances are the asking price would be a little less if not the same as a regular


 

On a side note if you do live in South East Asia and want a key just message me. I have one but live in America =\

Yesterday I got warned by a mod and accused me of trying to **""game flair system""** by trading *worthless* TF2 items and below average bundles with friends (whom I previously never knew or associated before I traded with them)

The first trade was where I traded a game for $7 worth of TF2 items. I fail to see how can that much amount be deemed as worthless. 

~~For the second trade

According to a mod

I honestly don't care about flair. For paypal transactions I have my own set of rules which include either atleast 2 year old steam account

That being said

All I want is couple of moderators to answer my question

* Why aren't these said trades considered valid? ~~Trading Fortix for a $0.50 DLC would be considered as a valid trade why wouldn't trading complete URL for below average bundles be considered invalid? And same goes for items.~~ Trading a $1.75 TF2 key for a game is considered valid but trading $7 worth of TF2 items for same game isn't considered valid. Justification please
* And a moderator accused me of trying to 'game flair system' and considers any TF2 items other than currency *worthless*. My trade confirmations were deleted and I was warned and that too before I could say anything otherwise. Is this level of high-handedness and free flowing accusations normal around here?

**EDIT:** I was under impression that below average bundles are allowed given if they are giftable URL. I misread the rules and was pointed out by Heretic. I will retract on that front.",,t5_2skv6,1370752799.0,,tier1,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/1fyriv/q_why_arent_trading_tf2_items_and_below_average/
1370675072.0,1fwziz,[PSA] New policy in effect. New users no longer need to message mods for tier 1 (grey) flair!,ltra1n,25,10,23,"From here on out mods will now be upgrading tier 1 grey flair automatically from the list of confirmed trades. No further action is needed on the part of users besides the standard trade confirmation from both partners in the trade confirmation thread. This will cut back on the moderator mail and give us a chance to get to other issues. Hopefully new user flair will be coming faster as well. Be patient as we're doing the best we can to catch up with the back log.

P.S. New users please remember to set your profiles to public when registering with steambot to avoid errors

I know, not to mention that anyone could've entered (and some probably did) the survey more than once, but the results clearly showed that the majority of voters find Public Service Announcements helpful to the community.

---

As many of you pointed out

But how would you feel about more distinguishable PSAs with different colourings? For example, etc. Do you think it's necessary, would it make any difference, or would just *over complicate* things?

I guess all of us find some of the PSAs annoying, and how do you think their frequency can be reduced.

1367594775.0,1dmfza,"[H] Many, many, many Steam tradeable games [W] Your corresponding Steam keys!",jfietkau,22,73, and since then my inventory backlog has balooned quite a bit. So here we go again!

----

I have collected a considerable number of tradeable Steam games that had been on my wishlist or otherwise fit my taste. So to clarify

To get the most out of them and to help out my fellow traders, and you can convert your obnoxious keys into hassle-free tradeables. :)

So **for example** if you have a *Driver San Francisco* key (e.g. from Amazon)

As for **potential sweeteners**, in the middle range I can accept things like *The Ship*, *Toki Tori* or even a couple of *Dota 2* copies, for bigger games I may request a bit of Steam Wallet for a game soundtrack, something small from the *Star Wars* sale or, at the upper end of the scale, a TF2 key. If you can supply more than one game

----

### Rules

1. You need at least gray flair to offer keys. Please be mindful of the subreddit rules when making your offer.
2. For bigger or riskier deals
3. Generally I'll expect you to go first
4. To reiterate

In his post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/1b9rw2/h_bastion_x5_arma_2_hotline_miami_mw3_the_walking/) he claimed to have Arma 2, MW3 and others. Eventually he agreed to MW3 for my GTA Complete (too good to be true) but insisted that I go first. I declined and I didn't think he would keep going even after I suggested a middleman, but he went with it. Surprise, surprise the key didn't work. It wasn't just previously used, it was just completely wrong; and only did it not work, he accused me of faking my proof of it not working. In the end I got my game back but he's been the subject of a PSA (a rather weak one though) before [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/z3wqh/psa_scammer_cant_scam/) AND he triggered a lot of red flags during our convo. 

I don't know if he necessarily intended to scam me

Also, it is not possible to play 18++ hours if he just got the game today, unless Steam number is bugged(chance are slim to none).

The reason why this subreddit is best steamgameswapping place out there, and the mods hard work, is **searchability**.

It takes so much time to browse these individuals's offers

So my suggestion is that every trader at least should *highlight* a few rarities, than his inventory link, and it turns out that he bought the potato reunion pack + a few games from the latest weekend deals..

Here are a few examples:

* [H] GTA Complete, daily deals and more [W] Super Meat Boy, Offers

* [H] valve complete pack, 200+ inventory [W] indie bundles, indie games, offers

So making the title more descriptive would make everyone's life easier.

I know it's not easy to even implement this in the rules (but including at least two games's titles on the title, but after the, khm.. *sharks* with a huge inventory will post their offers properly, than most likely the newcomers will follow.

First prize is **4 copies of L4D2**

Second prize is **four guest passes for Killing Floor**

This is a contest for groups of four to enter.  One of you will post a comment with a number 0-9 and then 3 others will post replies doing the same.

The four numbers from top to bottom will be your 4 digit guess. (**0001-9999**).

I will use a random number generator for each number individually and announce them one at a time on the [SGS Steam Group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/RedditGameSwap/#/button/p/right/c/purple/) group chat if you want to see the numbers picked live and I'll post the winning number here afterwards.

Closest 4 digit number wins.  Make sure it hasn't been taken because the first group post wins.

Your account must be at least 1 month old with 100 combined karma or older than 5 months. 1 post per user.

I would also like mention [/r/L4D2](/r/L4D2).  Those guys are a good group that sets up games for noobs and help you learn the game without references to fornicating with your mother when you do something stupid.

Good Luck!

----

**Project Vision:**

To provide the TF2 trading community with a fair, such as Backpack.tf, and present that pricing data to the user.  The TF2 Economy team is dedicated to providing a fair system that we can use ourselves, in light of the main TF2 Spreadsheet conspiracy.  Our system is built from the ground up to be efficient, fast, and secure, without being prone to price manipulation

The system runs on elected trade officials having votes, although I do have access (which I need as the web dev :P ).  This eliminates many of the issues seen on Backpack.tf and the TF2 Spreadsheet.  Any addition ideas to combat price fraud will be considered.

As for the current design, I know the front end is fairly bad.  As a front end web developer myself, I've spent most of my time working on the APIs and back end to make TF2 Economy work.  I do have graphics people working on a design, but feel free to submit one of your own if you feel the need.  I'm sure they would love to have additional input.

This system is planned to be the official pricing guide to /r/TF2Trade

----

**Leadership:**

The leadership of the TF2 Economy project is being divided between several key figures

&gt;MLGM - Head of Graphics
 &gt;&gt;VideoVideo - Graphics Support

&gt;Qwix and ME Chihuahua [MCT] - Project Support

&gt;Macropower - Head Pricer

&gt;agg23 - Project Lead and Head Developer
&gt;&gt;Ponco - Domain Owner and Development Support

Additional members will be added/removed as necessary.

----

**Pricers:**

What we now need from the community are members who are willing to start using the system.  People who have a high trading reputation, but as far as I can tell it should be usable.  Additional features will be added as time goes on.

The rules are:

1. Pick a number between 1 and 200

2. Tell me which you prefer

3. If you are entering this giveaway

4. The code **may not be retraded to another person**

~~*Alternatively*, I'd consider that, but I would prefer to give the giveaway a chance first.~~

**An unpleasant truth about trading:** The indie bundles we love so much devalue existing tradable copies of our games. To make matters worse

If the games are good, often months--and then there's The Ship, which has been at the bottom of the barrel since last December).

I'm a patient trader. I play the long game and don't mind to let stuff sit in my inventory for months. **If you aren't so patient, maybe we can work out a deal.

**What do you get?** You get something new to play or re-trade immediately. **What do I get?** I will let the stuff sit and re-trade it in a few weeks or months when the game is (hopefully) worth a little more again.

**Consider this an experimental offer.** It may very well meet with no success. Or it may make some people very happy.

If you act like a raging douche in your interactions with other traders we'll probably ban you. Just a fair warning.

###IMPORTANT THING THE THIRD:

I've noticed that some people have been using the [PSA] tag to ask questions. This is a no-no. We're going to contact /u/Deimorz and ask him to add a [Q] tag for the automod so people can ask questions without making it look like they're announcing something important to the community.

Regarding leaked keys (especially Dirt 3, so that if it activates, it's not leaked.

It is my believe that's not the case, and much to my disappointment when I tried to activate the key on Steam it tells me it's a Duplicated key - which means the unique key is being used by another Steam account.

I followed the procedure to CD key reset and now I'm waiting for Steam support - it's taking some time but I have no doubt in my mind that once it's done, have their steam account affected).

So for those of you who think just because you can activate a key then it's fine... no it's not. Buyer (Swapper) beware. Always ask for proof when trading keys or stick with giftable copies.

I traded iiz3rkaii a copy of Borderlands GOTY in exchange for a Minecraft Alpha Account.

I insisted that he give me the account info first because he's only been a redditor for a month and has -15 karma.

I added him on steam

 I was cautious, checked to see if the account was a full account, it was.

 I asked him if there was a way to indicate whether it was an Alpha account or not

I figured that since I had access to the account and had changed the password that I was safe. So, etc.

A few minutes later I downloaded the game

I contacted him at his steam name of ""**Silent_sound1996**"" and asked him what the deal was

Upon my request for help with the multiplayer password he blocked all communication from me on Steam and will not reply to my messages. Hence

I'm getting a response from him on reddit but he's just denying it. I'm going to take screenshots showing that I can't log in to Minecraft

Until he resolves this issue

I have made this post to make other people aware of this scammer and ask the community's assistance in reporting him to Steam by going to his profile page

That should be enough to get his account banned and cause him to lose all of his games that he scammed people out of.

this guy come to me and contacted me without giving his reddit name, i checked his profile, he has only 5 games, and played very limited time , plus the guys who wrote reputation most of them has private profile 

screenshot for chatlog http://uploadpic.org/v.php?img=Y402kybfpD http://uploadpic.org/v.php?img=eI67fWK8zb

most probably the ones give good reps on his profile are other fake users he's controlling most of them are private profile also be carefull about ""**alyayme, s3xy** "" the problem what is his real original steam profile that added and uses the games he scammed , we should find and report his real profile to hurt him
