RedditDayOf encourages readers to up-vote good content, who decided to down-vote everything they didn't agree with. This meant we saw relevant submissions getting down-voted out of sight, and the only up-voted things were the things that were actually irrelevant.

I know this wouldn't have been the act of the regulars, whether the topic interests you or not, or whether you disagree with the general point. Sadly, the group of people on the subreddit yesterday (somewhat small in number compared to usual subscribers) are uncommon with how RedditDayOf works, meaning the day was ruined for the usual readers.

In hindsight, so that is what we did. There was no malicious intent by the admins (we don't have a collective opinion on the debate).

I think the admins do an amazing job keeping the subreddit running. It isn't only the deleting spam and bad posts, only those who came in for the pure reason of down-voting and insulting).

1344298071.0,xsmrb,Aug 6-RedditDayOf Precious Stones- How to know if it's a fake,green_lemons,130,11,73,"**Time to drop some knowledge.

Outside of the initial ""Ooh, there are many interesting details that go into making them look the way that they do.

Hope this is interesting: Don't be fooled. Because of their value and rarity

Imitations have been made for at least 6, the main imitations are (1) glass, (2) diamond stimulants, (3) composites, (4) synthetics, and then of course enhancements.

Glass- It's versatile, so it will scratch more easily. In addition to that, its facet edges (where it has been shaped/cut) will appear dull and worn fairly quickly with wear, and there may be bubbles or distinctive swirls within the glass, which can be detected with a 10x magnified loupe (hand lens). This may seem obvious, but plenty of people are fooled as ""faking technology"" becomes more advanced.

Diamond Simulants- One gemstone can be used to imitate another more expensive variety, a hard stone called moissanite has been used as a diamond simulant. The main difference is that diamonds are singly refractive, so if you are looking at your new jewelry and your 'diamond' reflects multiple facets inside of it from the side, it's moissanite and not real. Unfortunately, there are inexperienced vendors of jewelry and gemstone products who are fooled as well.

Composites- Imitations can also be composites- made of more than one part. For example, the difference between the actual piece of gem on top and the glass/synthetic setting should be obvious. Gem-topped ""doublets"" can be made to imitate gems of all colors by altering the color of the glass beneath the gemstone top. This is often a very tricky one to catch, because jewelers will often set the stone (put it into the jewelry) in a way that the owner can't look at the gem from the side or the bottom to see the two parts.

Pay CAREFUL attention when you are buying OPAL jewelry. Opal composites are VERY common because opal often occurs naturally in thin seams with the gem forming into very thin slivers or slices. Jewelry makers will often cement a tiny piece of precious opal onto a backing layer of ""potch"" (nonprecious) opal, or even plastic (I have received a number of those).

Synthetics- Lab-produced gemstones are becoming more and more popular. Even though they have the same chemical composition as their natural counterpart, forming a candle shaped solid form of the gem, then faceted it into jewelry-quality pieces. More popular and still used today are the flux-melt method, in which ingredients are melted at high temperatures in a platinum crucible with a solvent until they cool into crystals, and the hydrothermal method, in which ingredients are melted in hot-water solutions at high pressures in sealed containers and then cooled until crystals form. Most synthetic emerald, ruby, without flaws or inclusions, it becomes increasingly harder to tell. If you have suspicions that your gemstone may be synthetic

Enhancement- The color and appearance of natural and synthetic gemstones can be enhanced by oiling, foiling, heat-treating, irradiating, and filling. Oiling (used to fill in cracks in heavily included gems like emeralds) is an acceptable method of enhancement, though in recent years more durable resins have been introduced. Oil and stains may leak and can be identified by wiping with an absorbent cloth. Very simple. Turquoise, lapis lazuli, which wear down over time. Some dye-jobs are easier to identify if the stone doesn't naturally occur in the dyed color. Heat-treating and irradiating gemstones (with oxidizing conditions- basically heating them up to very high temperatures- electrons or radioactive particles) can be used to enhance or change gemstone color as well. There are other forms of enhancement as well

Basically, and make sure that the price matches the quality of the stone. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.

**This knowledge comes from years of studying gemstones and working in the jewelry business. Some information regarding synthetic methods was researched from Cally Oldershaw's ""Guide to Gems"" from the Gemological Society of London.

Catharism was a dualistic religion: they believed that there was a Good God, the creator of the material world. The God of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament was thought of as being the Evil God, and the Good God was the God of the Christian New Testament. Cathars believed that human souls were reincarnated into new human or animal bodies after death, but that there was a way to break that cycle. More on that in a moment. 

The really interesting part about Cathars, because humans are souls (good) trapped in bodies (bad), procreative sex was viewed negatively, because it would lead to another soul being trapped when a baby was born. But non-procreative sex, including (apparently) homosexuality, along with contraception, was looked on as an acceptable alternative to procreative sex. Also, there is no really great reason not to end one's life sooner than it would end naturally, the genders were considered equal for all intents and purposes

Cathars were divided into two groups, instead living ordinary medieval lives and undergoing a special end-of-life baptism ceremony in the hopes of being freed from the cycle of reincarnation. The Elect or ""Perfecti,"" on the other hand, were people who chose to get baptized right away, and then to adhere to an ascetic lifestyle and to travel the country, preaching the good news and earning a living by doing work, rather than accepting donations. (Some consider the formation of certain Catholic orders, as a direct response to the popularity of the Perfecti, or even authority in the church; they were mostly just looked upon as especially good. In either case

The Catholic church could not decide if the Cathars were a Christian heretical sect or simply their own religion. (They disagreed with them about not only dualism and procreation, and refusal to incorporate images, crucifixes, or even material elements like oil or water into their religious life.) Eventually they gave up trying to figure it out and exterminated them in the [Albigensian Crusade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albigensian_Crusade), (""Albigensian"" being just one of many names used by outsiders for this group; in fact, it is not known whether they referred to themselves as ""Cathars"" either, since their texts mostly seem to call them ""Good Men"" or ""Good Christians""). 

More info on the Cathars can be gathered at [this] (http://www.cathar.info/) interesting website

1333904644.0,rzean,Call to Action - The direction of this community,andyjonesx,48,5,12,"Hi.

As always

I have the bot up and running perfectly now, I have decided that **I will appoint quite a few moderators**.

I want to get quite a few as I need people to fulfil the following duties:

- Give out post awards

- Decide upcoming topics

- Moderate spam

---

##Post Award Mods

I need about 6-10 people that will go through the daily posts and highlight those they think were good. If they thought the topic was really good they will work with a web interface of the bot and nominate it for a post award. I am considering making this even more people who are able to nominate posts to the bot. 

This role won't require you to come on every single day, have an interest in learning, and thus be able to decide what is interesting and what isn't.

## Topic deciders

I want a committee of 4-5 people who will decide on the daily topics, just to be able to collect and discuss the weekly suggestions, and when they are decided on they will need topics.

---

People let me know either in here or in messages if you are interested in any of these roles. I have a bit of work to do to get a web interface of the bot before any of the stuff is possible

Thanks

Andy :)",self,t5_2t1r3,False,,mod,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/RedditDayOf/comments/rzean/call_to_action_the_direction_of_this_community/
