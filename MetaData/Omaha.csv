We will be a fast casual restaurant specializing in gourmet tacos. Ingredients will be all over the board and will be a completely unique concept to the Omaha area. We wont have your traditional ground beef tacos as we feel you can get those anywhere. 

I want to avoid making a shameless plug or using reddit to do advertising but I feel this could be of interest to some of you and would love to support the r/Omaha gang in the future when I open.

I have a Facebook page if you would like to keep up to date with announcements and news. https://www.facebook.com/pages/Voodoo-Taco/555725161134181

Someone asked me for a rundown of the Omaha Beer Scene since they will be visiting soon.  I figured a larger audience would be alright in case anyone ever decides to come visit us.  If you don't care about Flyover Country

I'm not going to cover festivals, beer bars and quite a few places that aren't open yet, but should be this summer or soon thereafter.

I'm not going to cover Lincoln or the rest of the state as that would double the size of this post

The only place in Council Bluffs worth mentioning is 1892 which is a German Beer Hall that is frequented by bikers.  Just do yourself a favor and avoid Council Bluffs in general.

Breweries - Open Now

- Lucky Bucket Brewery - Brewery. Currently the largest in town

- Nebraska Brewing Company - Brewpub.  The Melange A Trois is my pick.  However, so we'll see what that brings.

- Upstream - Brewpub. Their regular lineup is alright

- Rock Bottom Gold Medal Tap House - technically not a brewery since they just ship in award winning beer from their other locations... if you know what this place is, food is excellent.

- Laslzo's - carries Empyrean beer.  While not my favorite

Beer Bars

Beer Corner USA - Crescent Moon, Beertopia 
(disclaimer: I basically live at this bar
It's a constant on Draft Magazine's Top 100 Beer Bars in the US.  
Currently there are 36(-40?) American Craft Beers on Tap.  
Recently the owner decided to drop Blue Moon from the lineup since it didn't meet the spirit of that goal.  
One beer engine that rotates frequently
Downstairs in the Huber Haus
Through a doorway is Max &amp; Joe's which has 13 Belgian Beers on tap and plenty of Belgian bottles.  
Next door is Beertopia
Food is great if you like American Bar Food.  Most things are homemade
The original Reuben was invented across the street and they sell a LOT of them there.  Frank's Kraut is supposed to be featuring the bar on their cans in the near future for this fact.  
If you want to relax and have some beers
Most often has proper glassware
Beer Knowledgable Staff

Krug Park
In Benson
~50 taps
Across the street from Jake's and The Waiting Room
In it's first year open
NO TELEVISIONS (good or bad depending on your world view)
No food
Staff is fairly knowledgeable
They make a mean mixed drink
Proper glassware most of the time

Jake's
In Benson
Two bars
~20 taps
Semi-Proper Glasswear
Generally knowledgable staff
Makes decent mixed drinks
Near all the other stuff in Benson

Beercade
In Benson
~20 taps
~20 Arcade Machines that rotate frequently
Staff could possibly be knowledgeable

Lot 2
In Benson
Technically not a brewery
Amazing food

Lauter Tun
Your best bet out west
There is a stage behind the taps
Staff is knowledgeable about beer
Most often not proper glassware

Omaha Tap House
Good place to stop if you're downtown.
~15 taps
Great burgers!
Staff has usually been knowledgable in my experience

Blatt Brew &amp; Table
Directly next door to TD Ameritrade Park - Home of the College World Series (I didn't know it existed either until I moved here)  It's also near the convention center.
Can either be packed or dead depending on what's going on nearby.
Staff is usually not the greatest
Food is overpriced and somewhat silly.
Burgers are great!
~20 taps

Brass Monkey
This place is different.  
It's a South Omaha dive bar (like a really divey dive bar) turned into a craft beer bar (around 35 taps).  
Often when you walk in
Often the beer sits too long and has off flavors.  
Often glasses of beer are sold for at or under cost.  Some people think the bar is a way to launder money since it doesn't make any financial sense.  
Can be a really good time
No food
Two beer engines
No proper glassware
Staff knows little to nothing about beer

Library 
Northwest
35-40 taps.  
Usually has odd tap selection as the owner prefers scotch.
Glasswear and Staff Knowledge is iffy.
Owner is kind of a dick

Opening Soon

Omaha Brewing Company
Being opened by a bunch of New York lawyers who moved back after 'retiring' a lot of people think they are biting off more than they can chew by opening three places at the same time.  Just had some of their beer at a recent beerfest and some of it isn't good

John Faher's As Of Yet Unnamed Brewpub - will open on Farnam near Farnam Brewing Company and the Crescent Moon

Borgata Brewing Company - In the Old Market

Infusion Brewing Company - In Benson in what people are calling the Benson Beer District

Another one that's in the planning phases and they might not want the cat out into the public eye or whatever.

Well to avoid this when I try to buy local over online as much as possible. 

My Mom's hot tub had started freaking out and after doing a bit of research i trouble shot the problem down to the top side control panel just having a short and sending too many signals repeatedly. I jump online to price the part so i can tell her what the damage is going to be and then call the 3 pool companies in town to get the part priced through them. The first two are not Balboa Certified dealers so they could't get the part we needed. I understand that; that is how business works sometimes.

I then contact Olympic pool and Spa. They ask me to send them a picture of the part and try to get the model number. I did them one better by already getting them all the information and gave them [this direct link to the part and the picture.]( https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3448982877395348785?hl=en&amp;gs_nf=3&amp;gs_rn=1&amp;gs_ri=serp&amp;tok=-MHFCedEiEyR9_RpYYEk3g&amp;ds=sh&amp;pq=balboA+MVP260&amp;cp=15&amp;gs_id=9&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=balboA%20MVP260%20/&amp;pf=p&amp;safe=off&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;oq=balboA+MVP260+/&amp;gs_l=&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2

He calls back 3 hours later and says he has found it. It is $135 dollars which is bit more expensive but i understand this man needs to eat too and he is probably only making 35 to 40 bucks on the sale by getting it through his distributor. I say go ahead and order it. I thank him for his time and go about my business. 

The part comes in and I go to pick it up. I can see it's not the right part but I'm just some guy messing around with my moms hot tub. He is the pool guy after all. I raise my concerns but he assures me it is fine. I go home and try it out nothing works correctly. One button puts it into economy mode another that is supposed to turn on the light runs the jets there is no light button it just a mess. 

Now I know most errors are user error so i think I sent him the wrong link. I check the link in my sent folder That is when i see it. If you look in the above link you can see under [related items this item.]( https://www.google.com/shopping/product/13543399622709213265?hl=en&amp;gs_rn=1&amp;gs_ri=serp&amp;tok=-MHFCedEiEyR9_RpYYEk3g&amp;ds=sh&amp;pq=balboA+MVP260&amp;cp=15&amp;gs_id=9&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=balboA+MVP260+/&amp;pf=p&amp;safe=off&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;oq=balboA+MVP260+/&amp;gs_l=&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2

I'm pissed but mistakes happen so i call him to try to resolve it. 

Owner: Hello this is Olympic pool and spa.

Me: Hi I was in there a bit earlier to pick up that hot tub part. It doesn't seem to be the right part and isn't coded correctly.

Owner: Sorry sir but we don't do refunds.

Me: Listen. I try to go through local businesses to help small businesses flourish. I have checked the part number and it isn't correct. You confirmed with me that it will work just fine or i wouldn't have taken it. I see the part you ordered isn't the right part and the number you confirmed isn't the right number. I am pretty pissed that you would do this but if you could just order the right...

Owner: Now you listen. Don't you cuss at me. I am a god damned business working the United States of America. I can choose to sell

Me: Sir I never signed anything. If i could just get the part we agreed upon I'll be out of your hair. 

Owner: Bring the card and the part into the store and we will just refund it asshole. 

I drive in and go to the desk. 

Me: Here it is.

Owner: We don't refund electronic items. Take the part and go home.

Me: So you had me drive here just to waste my time. 

Owner: Pretty much.

Me: But it isn't even the right part check the link i sent you. 

Owner: I did and it is the right part. You don't know what you are talking about.  

Me: You are sitting right in front of a computer i can pull up the email right now. It isn't the right part you ordered the 75 dollar part

Owner: It's my business I can do whatever I god damned well please. I work in the United States of America. 

Me: Okay now you listen to me asshole. You have 3 options. You take the part and give me the money back. I take the part and call the bank and get my money back. Or you take the part and I call the bank and get my money back. They all result with me getting my money back. The only option you have is whether or not you keep the part. 

With a glare the owner says ""Will you at least pay for the shipping?"" 

I left.

Never again. When amazon shuts them down It will make the pool part market in Omaha infinitely better. I know its long but buyer beware. They are greedy shysters that only care about their bottom line. 

TL;DR: The owner of Olympic Pool and Spa are giant dicks and when caught in a ""mistake"" will adamantly deny it and blame the customer. When trying to be civil and work well with them they still refused until I escalated it out of their control.

1334725474.0,sfjyl,Went to Family Fun Center,bromaha247,45,9,29,"Went to the Family Fun Center for the first time since they closed down on friday with friends and figured a review comparing the old place to the new place was much needed considering how much is different. So here it is broken up into categories.

First in doors:

When you first walk into the doors and if you've gone into the old Fun Center before this place seems like a completely different building. The counter is an interesting but cool looking sheet metal and black

Counter:

When we walked up to the counter we had brought some old tokens with us expecting it to still be the old token and ticket games from the old place. Instead they sold us these really cool looking game cards that automatically save all the tickets onto the card for you. The guy at the register let us put all the tokens onto the card thankfully so that was a big bonus in my book.

Golf: 

First thing we wanted to play was the golf so we bought the golf balls and headed over to the course by the doors. Compared to the old golf course that I remember it is a BIG improvement. The course has a couple holes where there are like drawbridges and other odd moving parts. Thankfully there was no giant holes in the wall and graffiti on everything like the old one use to always have. Overall it's much better flow and looks alot better.

Games:

When we got done with the golf all of us had a couple bucks on our game cards and decided to play a couple of em. I could tell that they had gotten a few new ones in but unfortunately it was all basically the same games from before. On the plus side

Lasertag:

When we got done about 4 of us decided to go try out the lasertag because that was always our favorite thing to play whenver we went to the old one. Bought the passes and walked over there and HOLY HELL the line was long! The guy running it said it would be 45 minute wait. So we sat and waited what seemed like for forever watching each small group to go in one after another. When we were sitting watching the others go in and listening to music one of my friends went up and asked the guy if they were planning on getting more vests. He said that they were being worked on and hopefully soon they would have alot more vests. The family of 5 ahead of us decided that the wait was too long so we thankfully got to go in early. When you first go in it's basically the exact same same as the other fun center except ALOT more open. Overall it's always fun to play lasertag at the Fun Center and had the usual experience.

Paintball:

I had never known that they had paintball there but my friend was explaining to me how it worked and was pretty interested to try it out. Went and bought cards to play it and waited in line. Tip for anyone wanting to play paintball there... ask if they are running a tournament! There were soo many damn kids waiting around the area. I guess the school they went to decided to have a paintball tournament there. So we waited and waited and finally we just got smashed together with some other group that was waiting in line so it was 6 on 6. They showed us this video and i gotta say

Prize Area:

As we were about to leave we all decided to get some prizes from the little prize area in the middle. When we walked up fortunately there was no one else waiting so we were helped right away. The girl helping us scanned the cards and we got our prizes. The area itself looks basically the exact same except black and silver instead of the ugly red and faded white which was a much bigger improvement.

Final thoughts:

Overall I would have to say the Fun Center needed a makeover and they got it almost completely right. I don't like how it seems almost smaller than the other building and how it seems like there is much fewer games

This is just a reminder post for the BarCraft event at [The Lauter Tun](http://thelautertun.com/).

[Original Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Omaha/comments/1jak9i/omaha_barcraft_beers_of_liberty/)

We are very excited to host the first BarCraft in Omaha!  We are looking to expand out to other games in the future

[BarCraft facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/events/459112907518642/)
____

**Details**

Location: 3309 Oakview Dr. Suite 102

**Doors open at Noon**  - 4 hours earlier than normal.

**Entry**:  21+ is free entry, you will be asked to leave (we do understand that washing your hands pulls ink off, but you can tell if you REALLY tried).  We are only letting up to 10 underage people in the bar, due to the fact that we cater 99% alcohol and 1% Non-alcoholic beverages.

**Prizes/Raffle**:  Blizzard was kind enough to send us a box of fun stuff! When you enter

Prizes include:

* Battle.net authenticators 
* T-shirts
* Bottle openers
* Stickers
* Lanyards 
* 2 Razer Spectre Gaming Mice (Starcraft: WoL and HotS edition)

**Food**: So far

**Drinks**: We have 2 shots and 3 mixed drinks that are Starcraft specific.  We will be making our regular drinks as well, so have a look.

**End of Event**: The official event will be over when a WCS champion is crowned.  Feel free to stay after the event is over to continue drinking and conversing with fellow Starcraft fans.
___

Starcraft Themed Drinks:

* Archon (Drink)
* Zerg Creep (Drink)
* Vespene Gas (Drink)
* Hellbat (Shot)
* Stimpack (Shot)

All of them are very delicious (we have tested them on random customers).  I wish I had some better pictures

___

I have put a decent amount of work into this event

**If you plan on getting completely trashed

There is a possibility that I could move to Omaha from South Florida, if not id have to look for something else. 

Unfortunately I have never been to Omaha. My GF says she likes it and reminds her of Germany a bit (landscape wise) or Denver minus mountains. The closest I have been to NE is Denver CO which i have visited a few times for a few days at a time. I must say I really liked Denver
Have any of you lived in South Florida and moved to Omaha? If so which did you like best? Otherwise how about compared to Denver (sorry but as mentioned that's the closest i have to compare to NE).


We are both in our early-mid 30's
We would love to do more outside activities but unfortunately the extreme heat year round is not very conducive here in FL. 
We are not really beach/water sport persons so will not miss that
We hate the traffic here
We hate that there's no seasons (other than hot
We are not really into the south beach/crazy party scene so wont miss that. However a bar once in a while
Speaking of music

Things we do like about South FL however i that, we don't have to deal with snow although i must say I would love to have some snow, just not all year round! 
Of course we have friends here so that's a tough one leaving behind but we'd be willing to do it if its for the best.

Unfortunately having never been in Omaha all i get is stereotypes when i mention it to people here...""Omaha? whats out there? only cornfields and pastures"" I know they are silly but obviously people here have no clue. Most people do like living here i guess so they could never consider the thought of leaving beaches and nightlife for the Midwest.

What do you like about Omaha and what do you dislike? Would you live elsewhere?

Thanks!!

There was also a Dart brand 20 oz generic white styrofoam cup with a chocolate milkshake in it. It would have happened during the end of the Husker game (10:00 ish), but most use branded cups. So I'm assuming it would be a mom-and-pop store. Around Dundee area.

Any help would be appreciated

Please

EDIT 1: Not gas stations. eCreamery may still be an option. They've been closed, but not in their styrofoam, and the other cups don't look like the ones with shit in them. Broncos are branded. Petrows is closed on Sundays so I couldn't check there. Any other ideas? I feel like today would have been the golden day of ""Who got a chocolate milkshake and two waters last night"". Further it is away, less likely they'll remember.

1) will i get murdered/raped? is there a high crime rate?
2) when i get off the plane
3) i have never planned any sort of trip before

if any native omaha-er is willing to help me plan my great escape, i'm willing to take a chance and find out.

After the Elmwood Park portion of the meetup we will proceed to Gerdas along the orange line. I would highly prefer that anyone that is going to be attending the Gerdas portion of the meetup be there either with us at the park or at Gerdas by 5 o'clock

After the group gets dinner at Gerdas we'll make a group trip over to Legends for a bit while we decide on where to go for the after-event.

If you are going to be coming to the meetup sometime after 5 o'clock give me a call at the aforementioned number so you can determine if we are at Gerda's

Also for Gerdas

- Elmwood near red dot

I'd also like to hear about the music scene these days, when some of the last shows I remember seeing were at Sokol and that Irish bar next to the strip club on 72nd and Dodge... Actually, I've been to a couple gigs at the Slowdown since then, but those were for touring bands.

What else are the wicked little heathens in Omaha up to these days? Are warehouse and massive house parties still pretty popular? Are the same downtown clubs still dominating the dance scene like they pretty much always have? (And just for my own personal shits 'n giggles
