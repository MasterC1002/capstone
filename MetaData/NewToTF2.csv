1334232508.0,s61pa,Why you shouldn't play at Gentlemann's Estate.,,232,30,141,"First off it's not even slightly a good server for new players. Everyone who plays is pretty dang good and will make fun of you if you are not as good as them.

Secondly: Apparently it's ran by another self righteous server owner like 99% of other servers. I designed their website for them (twice because he switched forum software) and last night I enabled the gscramble plugin because without it the players were having a bad experience due to the autoscramble not working correctly. I wake up this morning with all of my rights removed and Deltadude crying in steam chat about he specifically stated to not enable any plugins. I'm curious to why he told me he's managed numerous TF2 servers and yet none of them are still running right now. Maybe it's doing the complete opposite of what your players want? For someone who asked me to be a ""partner"" and ""not do everything I demand"" you sure showed me buddy.

My point? Stay away from Gentlemann's Estate. I'm sure the folks here at NewToTF2 will agree. We've all been screwed over by this guy one way or another. One of these days I'll start charging people for this crap.

Another thing I've noticied is that this guy has over $1, shuts down the servers and starts over. So if you DO go play, for the love of god think twice before donating.


TL;DR I'm pretty sure Gentlemann's Estate is a scam.

**EDIT 1:** Now I've magically been banned from the website &amp; server as well. I didn't know people were so touchy about a simple plugin being enabled. Good thing I only wasted a week on their website. Looks like he banned my wife too who was only playing on the server with me sometimes.

**EDIT 2:** I just noticed he took down the 2Fort server after it only being up for about 12 hours. He keeps doing that as well. He'll open a new server for a day or so then shut it down. The main one is the only one that's stayed up.

**EDIT 3:** [Possible NewToTF2 Server?](http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/s6j94/possible_newtotf2_official_server/)

**FYI**: I just put up a 24 slot payload and CP server: 74.91.122.35:27015 [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Funkitown)

EDIT: **I wanted to come back and state that this server sadly will NOT be an official server for NewtoTF2. I spoke with Lapper and they will not have a server that isn't ran by them so my server is out of the question. I still hope some of you will come play with us though.**",,t5_2rbtk,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/s61pa/why_you_shouldnt_play_at_gentlemanns_estate/

**Medic overview:**

* Is considered a light class.  Has 150 health.
* Moves at 106% speed
* Generally considered high value kills
* Relatively weak in direct combat(What Douglas Adams would call ""Mostly harmless."")
* Mechanics(The Ubercharge) allow for superhuman feats of action
* Is capable of extending the life of his team mates beyond merely restoring their health.

Their roles in a team are...

* Healing injured players
* Extinguishing burning players
* Actively maintaining front line classes mid combat(Soldiers, pyros)
* Deploying ubercharges at critical times
* Above all else: Surviving

They excel in...

* Team Support
* Nest clearing(Medigun)
* Crowd clearing(Kritztrieg)

They are vulnerable to...

* Anyone
* Spies
* Snipers
* Scouts

**A few words on the medic...**

The Medic is one of the handful of classes that people suggest that new players take a role in.  The medic is an immense support class

What most players wind up doing is starting out as medic, despite not having played medic in a long time, they'll find that they have become better medics.  

The reason for this is that medic is a largely experience based class.  They're very easy to get into

On to the guide.

**Healing**

The main function of the medic is to keep his team alive.  Using the medigun on your fellow players will heal them up to 150% of their total life(Heavies have 450 health when overhealed by a medic

Any amount of healing

**Ubercharges**

Once your ubercharge meter reaches 100%

The ubercharge does something based on which medigun you have equipped.  I will go into more details about the actual weapons later.  For now

* The Ubercharge: The standard Medigun's ubercharge.  This makes both you and your patient invulnerable for 8 seconds.  You are still vulnerable to pushback effects.  This is an excellent tool for dispatching enemy sentry nests
* The Kritz: The Krtiztrieg's ubercharge.  This makes your patient fire nothing but critical attacks for the next 8 seconds.  This is devastating in the hands of a soldier
* The Quick Fix:  The Quick Fix's ubercharge.  This ubercharge rapidly heals you and your patient while preventing knock backs from enemy fire.  Unlike the standard ubercharge

**Okay

This is often the most frustrating part of playing a medic  Keep these two priority lists in mind when you heal

List 1: Status
From highest priority to lowest priority.

* Burning or Bleeding
* Taking continuous
* Severely injured
* Injured
* Uninjured
* Takes health packs while you're near.

List 2: Identity/Activity

* Fellow medic
* On the front line
* Retreating from the front line
* On the second line
* Using a dispenser.
* Healing the player would greatly endanger your life.

Example scenario:  You have a sniper

The soldiers and the heavy are on the front line.  The sniper is camping a dispenser and sniping from the second line.  The medic is pocketing one of the soldiers.  You(another medic) are just getting into the fight.

A pyro round a corner and one of the soldiers shoots in panic.  The pyro airblasts in panic and instantly kills the soldier

**Who do you heal?**:  The Medic.   The medic is both severely injured and burning

Scenario #2:  You arrive to a fight as it is going on.  The front line is decimated

A heavy, engineer and sniper are all in the fight.  

The sniper is a huntmans(the bow) and is braving the front lines because the other team members were recently killed in a freak rocket jump accident.  

The engineer is maintaining his gun and his dispenser

The scout is up close and personal with the enemy team and is flanking them mercilessly.

The demoman is around the corner spamming the enemy team from behind cover with his grenades and stickies.

2 soldiers and a pyro come out of the enemy's spawn.  A freak crocket nails the heavy(who had a small overheal from you, nearly killing him  The demoman sets off his stickies and kills all 3 of the on coming attacks, but not before a stray rocket splashes you, dropping you to about 90 health.

**What do you do?**  There are no more incoming enemies at the moment(the demoman killed them.)  You extinguish the sniper first

The scout is too close to the enemy and is not reliable protection should someone else come out.  Extending yourself could result in you getting killed as soon as someone rounds the corner

The scout(smartly) returns to the front line and uses the engineer's dispenser to heal himself.  Top yourself off using the dispenser

The sniper is at a higher risk of dying should he get hit early on, so long as it doesn't risk your own.

** I AM FULLY CHARGED. **: Somehow, and 5 spies).  The soldier and pyro join you on the front line, and no one is really sure where the spies are.  The demoman steps out into the front line, eager to take the ubercharge.

The enemy team spawns 4 soldiers, an engineer, and 3 spies.  The heavy and medic are on the left, firing from a doorway while the right has the rest of their team behind a wall, shooting rockets willy-nilly.

**Who do you uber?**:  The Demoman.

The soldier only has 4 shots, he will be unlikely to kill both sides.  The pyro is fast, but has limited range and will not be able to make good use of the uber until he is right on the enemy, which means the approach will be dangerous without first using the uber(which, unfortunately wastes time on the uber.)  The demoman's large capacity, high medium range damage makes him a great patient for this fight.

""Not one of you is going to survive this!"" he shouts, but the soldiers get caught in the blast and die, along with 2 spies.

The demoman taunts.

**What do you do?**:  You pull out your saw and murder the spy you see approaching your demoman

Which takes me to my next point.

**Observation**

Your job is to survive.  This means you need to know what is going on around you most of the time.  The medic has to spend less concentration on aiming than any other class

This doesn't mean you should be bossy or instructive to your team

If you have a mic, or locations of enemy spies.  Alerting your team to potential threats(or victims) will heighten their sense of awareness on the field, leading to not only your extended survival, but their's as well.  You can use voice commands to simulate this(IE: Incoming!  Spy!) if you lack a mic.

**ROLE**

 * SUPPORT CLASS
   * Keep your team alive with your Medigun/Kritzkrieg.
   * Break through defenses using your Ubercharge.
   * Cause mass casualties using your Kritzcharge.

**WEAPONRY**

 * PRIMARY WEAPONS: [Syringe Gun](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Syringe_gun) vs [Blutsauger](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Blutsauger)
   * If you're rarely fending for yourself

 * SECONDARY WEAPONS: [Medigun](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Medigun) vs [Kritzkrieg](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Kritzkrieg)
   * The common rule is that you take the Medigun on offense to use your Ubercharge invulnerability to break through sentry nests (when necessary)\[[3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcfJbQQN76I)]
   * If you have two Medics and a coordinated team you might want to have one Medigun Medic and one Kritzkrieg Medic so you have the best of both worlds.  The Medigun Medic will help destroy enemy buildings\[[3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcfJbQQN76I)] while the Kritzkrieg Medic will help destroy enemy players\[[5](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk2hbsfW5WQ)].

 * MELEE WEAPONS: [Bonesaw](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Bonesaw) vs [Ubersaw](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/%C3%9Cbersaw)
   * The majority of Medics use the Ubersaw because in most cases the 25% charge you gain is worth more than a slightly faster swing\[[6](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab0J0Uqhmcc)].  However

**OPTIONS**

 * Under Options &gt; Keyboard:
   * Bind a key to ""[Loadout Quickswitch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTORy6BxX7g)"" so you can easily switch between weapons\[[7](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/a42gp/question_about_changing_weapons_on_the_fly/)].
 * Under Options &gt; Keyboard &gt; Advanced:
   * Turn on ""Fast Weapon Switching"" so you can just press 1
 * Under Options &gt; Multiplayer &gt; Advanced:
   * Turn on ""Display damage done as text over your target"" so you know when you are successfully hitting your enemy.
   * ""MEDIC: Display a marker over the player you are healing"" will allow you to more easily see the player you are healing.
   * ""MEDIC: Injured teammates automatically call out"" is helpful if you [set the slider to something reasonable](http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/ajf4o/why_does_it_sound_like_my_door_is_ajar_when_i/c0hwwne).
   * ""Medigun continues healing without holding down fire button"" will allow you to just click on a player to heal them instead of having to click and hold.  Many have this turned on\[[8](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/8xcm6/medic_sticky_healing_option_on_or_off/)]
   * ""Remember the active weapon between lives"" and ""remember the 'last weapon' between lives"" both do what they say.  It can be handy since you heal with your secondary weapon

**TIPS**

 * GENERAL
   * Medic basics: [TF2 Wiki](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Medic) and [TF2 Tactics](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaMeZoV5-qs)
   * *Always* heal other Medics.
   * Have at least one Medic for every six players on your team.
   * If you're alone
   * Your life is more important than any other classes besides another Medic with more charge.  Just because you're healing someone who is suicidal doesn't mean you need to follow them to their death.  However
 * STAYING ALIVE
   * Always try to heal your patient while hiding behind corners or other obstacles so you will be out of the line of fire.  This is especially important when you unleash a Kritzcharge
   * If you must be out in the open always try to be move unpredictably.
   * Don't forget to look behind you for flankers such as Pyros, come out behind a weird corner, or just simply isn't where he should be, he might be a Spy.  Since Spies can't walk through you, you can tell someone is a Spy if you bump into them.
 * HEALING YOUR TEAM
   * The rate you heal teammates is dependent on how long ago they were damaged; the longer they were damaged, as this will allow enough time to increase the heal rate.  Of course, if everyone is dying and/or on fire, consider quickly switching between them to keep everyone alive.
   * The preferable way to play Medic is to stick close to the bulk of your team and heal everyone
   * The other way to play is to predominantly heal one great player on your team while s/he roams around pushing the enemy back
 * UBER/KRITZ CHARGING
   * Your Uber/Krit charges at maximum speed during setup time.  The exception to this is when you're healing someone being healed by a secondary source, or the payload cart, where it will be noticeably slower.
   * During regular play your Uber/Kritz charges at maximum speed when you heal damaged players or overheal healthy players to 150% of their health\[[11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2afZ9xiSSZs)].  It takes twice as long to get a full charge if you keep overhealing one player and four times as long if you're healing someone being healed by a secondary source, or payload cart.  This is why you should always try to heal and overheal everyone during play.
   * If you're building up an Uber/Kritz
 * UBER/KRITZ USAGE
   * When taking out a sentry with an Ubercharge *always* run ahead of your patient so the sentry fires at you first.  The bullets and rockets will knock you back, though, or you'll waste your Uber by being blasted across the map.
   * Uber Demomen should be your first choice to take out a sentry nest\[[3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcfJbQQN76I)]
   * Good targets for Ubercharges are [Demomen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcfJbQQN76I), [Soldiers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GMVkZXq_So), and [Heavies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxzYPkRt_f4).  Kritzcharged Pyros can work decently well, too, if you ambush a group of enemies who aren't protected by a sentry\[[14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWfPHcRrFPY)].  In general, while you should heal everyone, Demomen, Pyros
   * If you're being attacked and have a full charge, but at best, you'll survive and possibly have done some damage.",,False,,t5_2rbtk,,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/a4h1r/medic_tips/

The pyro is a heavily mechanic reliant class.  In order to get the most out of the pyro class

Let me start with their weapons

**Primary Weapons:**

* *The Flame Thrower(Stock)* : Standard flame thrower. Burns things

* *The Degreaser:* 65% faster weapon switch time

* *The Back Burner*: 10% more damage


**Secondary Weapons:**

* *The Shotgun(Stock)*: Standard shotgun

* *The Flaregun*: Long ranged fire-starter.  Always crits for 90 damage against players who are already on fire. (2 successive hits + afterburn will kill most classes)

* *The Detonator*: Long ranged

**Melee Weapons**:

* *The Fire Axe(Stock)*: Standard axe.  Kills things

* *The Axtinguisher*: 50% less damage against targets that aren't burning.  Always crits against players that are burning(195 damage).

* *The Rake*: You cannot be healed as quickly by medics

* *The Powerjack*: Enemies killed with the Powerjack restore 75 health to you.

* *The Homewrecker*: Removes enemy sappers from buildings and causes additional damage to enemy buildings.

***Load Out #1:  Puff and Stinger***

Primary: The Degreaser

Secondary: Flare Gun

Melee: Axtinguisher.

This load out selection makes use of the rapid swap time on the degreaser in combination with two weapons that always critical against burning targets.  This load out focuses on aggressive pursuit of isolated enemy players(both directly

***Puff and Stinger Tactics:***

**The Standard Puff and Sting**

This technique is simple, swap to your melee weapon(which should be your axtinguisher), and strike your enemy.  **This 1.5 second to 2 second move will kill anyone it hits**, except the heavy and anyone with an overheal.  It kills the heavy and anyone with an overheal in 2 hits.  It kills an overhealed heavy in 3 hits.

Note: Before someone asks, and the axtinguisher hit will kill them.

**The Puff

This is the same as the above, puff them once with the degreaser, then airblast them into a wall or other solid object. Close in and follow up with the axtinguisher to finish the job.

**The Hotshot**

When faced with classes who have managed to put themselves at a considerable range of you(for instance, follow up with a shot from your flare gun.  The flare gun's critical deals 90 damage, and the afterburn will frequently kill light classes after taking that critical hit.  It takes some time to get used to aiming the flaregun, but it is an invaluable addition to the puff and stinger's arsenal.


***Load out #2: Nestwatcher***

Primary: Flame Thrower or Degreaser

Secondary: Detonator

Melee: Homewrecker

This is primarily a defensive load out and set of tactics.  Most of these tactics can be done with any load out

**Spy Checking**

Check players with a single puff of flame from the flame thrower

If you see a spy, corner him and kill him.  Preventing spies from assassinating and sabotaging gear is a key to being an effective team pyro.  Do note that this might not earn you the most points in the game, but it will help ensure your team wins the game.

If a spy DOES manage to slip by

**Front-line Softening**

Using the detonator

Try to avoid close quarters combat if you're the only pyro on the team acting defensively


**Repelling Ubers and the Uber Balloon

Pyros can make game changing decisions by playing more defensively. If they are alive when an enemy uber charges through, thus denying your enemy team an ubercharge.

An effective trick for handling enemy ubers is ballooning them.  This is done by blasting an enemy uber into the air while they're being fired on by a sentry.  The sentry's knockback effect will send the uber soaring away.  This also works with other forms of invulnerability

Juggling can also be performed on enemy players. To do this, or until you are killed by enemy players.  Consider using this sparingly, as your diverted attention will often get you killed by the enemy team. 

***Loadout #3:  The Lone Pyro***

Primary: The Back Burner

Secondary: Shotgun 

Melee: Powerjack or Rake


This is a very hostile load out for the pyro.  Pyros using this load out at its best are rarely found with their team.  Instead, they pop out of hiding and melt their enemy team down *from behind*.

Since you are often alone when ambushing

**Effective Hiding**

Pyros should be located in nooks that players will pass, and hiding on a corner might still reveal your flamethrower to those who are approaching it.  Once they see a flame thrower, especially a back burner, they will want to kill you with all sorts of corner spam.

**Enemy Circling**

A cornerstone of any good pyro, as their fire is limited.

1341878890.0,wasm1,The Quick-Fix. What you're doing wrong.,fauxstellata,71,7,24,"The Quick-Fix gets a lot of hate on Reddit (and everywhere else) but it can be used effectively.

This post is not aimed at people who are convinced ""Stock is always best hurr durr"". It's for those who are already using it or are considering using it.

First off, go take that thing off. Using this weapon without understanding what it does is bad. It is not your normal Medigun, don't treat it that way and expect it to work.

If you want to use this weapon

If you're thinking ""Well I keep dying before I get Uber anyway.. I'll use it"" then stop again. Take it off

**Right

First off

The Kritzkrieg charges at 3.125%/sec if the targets HP is below 142.5% (nearly fully overhealed) and 1.56%/sec if the targets HP is above 142.5%. 

The Quick-Fix has the exact same charge numbers but does not overheal, he will not have to weaken himself to build faster.

**Which brings me onto the first misconception with this weapon: ""You should only use it if there is another Medic on your team"". This is false. If another player switches to Medic

Why? Two reasons. First off, pushing you back onto that 1.56% rate, which will be halved again if you share a patient. 

Secondly because another Medic makes the Quick-Fix redundant. You went Quick-Fix because you need more immediate healing. That +40% is now overshadowed by the +100% that other Medic is bringing in. Using the Quick-Fix when there is enough healing to go ahead is useless. Switch so you can provide overheals and a Ubercharge/Kritzkrieg.

The Quick-Fix allows ONE Medic to patch up his team faster than he would normally be able to. Once there are TWO Medics

The other misconception is that the Megaheal is useless. You should **stop using it like an Ubercharge.** The Megaheal is just a period where you heal your patient for 100HP/second and are immune to knockback

The Megaheal can help you mid-push once your team starts to weaken

* Whenever you are weak. Don't sit there at 50HP. Pop the Megaheal and get back to 150.
* If your patient is under attack and might die. (This is probably the most ""Ubercharge""-ish way)
* Two or more high-health teammates are weak
* You or your patient are standing on their point. The Megaheal does not stop you from capturing.

You can twist this to your own ends even. I once popped on a 10HP Soldier who was fleeing an important fight

Your Megaheal charges every 32 seconds on the dot, eliminating the need for the stalemate-breaker in the first place.

Remember you are not invulnerable though. Headshots, the Megaheal will only heal you and then only if you have a patient. 

Also remember that the other Medigun's charges have advantages over yours (Ubercharge cannot be killed by focus-fire/crits like the Megaheal can. Kritzkrieg will kill you) to counter the fact that you charge so damn quick.

Having said that, especially as he is immune to airblast.

That was longer than I expected it to be

**TL;DR - Medic-jumping.**

A few reasons why playing Medic as a noob is a great idea

* You'll learn the maps.  Being a Medic involves a lot of following players around.  They'll show you ins and outs of a lot of maps.  You'll learn where choke points and common sentry positions tend to be

* You'll be helping the team and getting a sense of purpose.  The worst part about starting TF2 for me was feeling like I was being completely useless, and it's easy to give them a boost.  They'll thank you for it.  You'll always feel productive, and the sense of teamwork will build.  This confidence helped me out a lot when I first started. 

* It's very rewarding and lots of fun. Almost all teams need more Medics, but if you're a strategic type, you'll have a blast playing Medic.  Commanding teammates around, being the key to a major push, blasting through a half dozen enemies at once: it's way more fun than you'll probably be having as other classes.  

Now, and have a great time.  It's really the best advice I can give.

* **LOVE YOUR ENGINEER** : A good engineer is like a good bass player. You'll never think to thank him. Most of the time you'll take him for granted. Half the time you won't even realize he's there. But he can be the driving force that holds everything together, ""Great, now I can get back into the fight!"" Once you get shot up, you'll come running back to my dispenser and think, ""Man, I'm sure glad this is here! Now I can get full health and ammo and return to the fray!"" Once the enemy starts pushing hard, you can fall back and my sentry will be there to help hold the line and you'll think, with that covering fire we can finally kill these off-colored bastards!"" But never once will you think about the engineer that made all of this possible. So show us some love

***EDIT EDIT EDIT EDIT***

Since this thread has gotten a lot of love

* **KNOW YOUR SURROUNDINGS** : This one will come more with time and experience. As an engineer, and which path the spies and ambushers are likely to take (either the high, low, or side road; something that gives them a lot of cover). A prime example of this is 2nd area on Gold Rush, first cap area. Most people will fight along the cart path, right up the middle. But there is a little tunnel off to the left (from the attacker's perspective) that most spies and sneaky scouts will love to take to get behind you. Try to position your sentry to cover both of these routes. I particularly like the platform across the small ravine so my sentry will cover the cart and a ton of area around it, and I can wrangle it easily to take out people going through the tunnel.

* **FLY YOU FOOLS** : One thing almost all inexperienced engineers do is try to salvage a hopeless situation. 2 heavies with a medic are charging your position, only to get blown to smithereens, riddled with bullets, and a knife in the back for good measure. A good engie will *get the hell out of there*. You're much more valuabe to your team alive than dead. If you make it out alive, you can start setting up your next base that much sooner instead of waiting to respawn and walk all the way there.

Something I like to do is if a demo is laying down stickies right in front of my sentry, set it down out of range of the stickies, then go after the demo with my shotgun while the sentry rebuilds. But I only go after him just long enough to get the sentry back up, not to hunt him down and kill him. Once the sentry is back up and I chase him off, I'm good to go for a little while. The main goal was to save my sentry so I won't have to rebuild it.

* **HELP YOUR FELLOW ENGIES** : I once played a game with 3 engineers in it. I set up my gear in a prime location, or they didn't hear me. Either way, all my gear was destroyed when it could have easily been taken care of by nearby engies. Later in that match, the same thing happened to one of the other engies. I saw him go down and the spy sap all of this stuff. So I ran over and saved his dispenser and sentry before the sappers took out his teleporter. He got back to the front lines and only had to drop his exit before he was good to go, whereas I had to completely rebuild everything.

* **PUT YOUR GEAR TO HELP YOUR TEAM** : I can't count how many times I've seen an engineer up high in a building with his sentry covering a walk way and has all of his gear up there as well. That's fine for him, so he really won't need a whole lot of metal to keep it up. If thats the case, where your sentry has some good cover, put your dispenser down lower where your team mates can get at it easier. They'll appreciate it more than having to trek up to your nest, then haul it back down for 3 seconds of healing and ammo pickup. Or build your nest closer to the action to really keep the enemy back.

1334487818.0,sao75,Regarding the Gentlemann Server and Myself,NaiDriftlin,56,13,43,"*Gentlemen*

Starting to hate that word

I'm a writer

Sorry that I have not been more attentive with what's been going on.  A family member has recently passed and

To give a history of our sudden removal of Gentlemann's Estate from my perspective (since I'm sure all of you are wondering

This ordeal started when I caught a glimpse of the Gentlemann's Estate post in /R/TF2.  As some of you know,) I decided to get behind it.

Seeing that the server was getting off the ground, decided to use my position as a NewtoTF2 Mod to garner attention for the server.  This is something that I realize now that I ***should not*** have done.  Aside from being largely off-topic for our community, it was an abuse of position that Lapper has been a friend, and thus kind enough not to point out.

As members of our community reviewed and played on the server, and made my offer to be an admin official, since it would put me in a more direct position of interacting with you guys.

If you guys didn't know it

Coming off of my tangent, stating that they were bossing him around, despite him being in direct ownership of the server.  I stated the obvious, citing the Golden Rule(Whoever has the gold makes the rules.)  I recommended that, if he felt the admins were a problem, he should ask them to take lesser duties or offer to let them step down gracefully.

Instead, banning them from the subreddit, and silencing anyone else who tried to argue the opposite.  In addition, he posted a copy/paste of an unflattering conversation pulled out of context(of which the context could not be verified.)

**That was strike number one

During our conversations

**This was strike number two.**

How did he manage to pull in so much money for these accounts

Since I couldn't verify the source of the funds

When I eventually did become an admin, he didn't seem bothered by it.

**This was strike number three.**  

Why did Delta not care about the productivity of his admins?  If not all admins

I went back to my roots(and my Recommended Server Checklist), I was actively endorsing a server that didn't meet my own standard.  My criticism grew sharp.  

And to my surprise

I continued to give Delta the benefit of the doubt, and having been mentored myself in the past, I know that the best way to improve is in harsh environments.  I criticized *everything* I saw wrong with the server, from the slot allotment, to the donation pandering..

**..By the way

... pulling the community off Reddit and onto a personal website...

**... Strike five...**

... the pay-to-win donation benefits(which was repealed due to the massive criticism from this community

**... Strike six ...**

... refusing to allow the community to moderate itself(Votekick/Voteban/VoteScramble

**... Strike seven(Game) and eight(Subreddit) ...**

... 32 slots plugin which kept ""breaking"" ...

**... Strike Nine ...**

... an SQL server that was hacked

**... Strike Ten(For the SQL-inject if true) and Eleven(For lying about not being able to fix it)...**


I had ***ELEVEN*** reasons not to play there, and one of our community supporters(Assp) talked to, the way these two members of our community were treated.  Not only that, but I noticed donation goals being reset *constantly*, putting the server in a perpetual 'Donation Drive' mode, despite there being well over a year's worth of donations in the buffer.

This is when my family member passed; I was in no position to make a rational argument to the community about it, because it would be a conversation between he and someone within the server that made him cut the connection.(Something I should have done 8 strikes prior.)

* Has 150 health and is considered a light class.

* Moves at 100% speed

* Can build Teleporters and Dispensers to provide transportation and health to allies like his traditional cousin.

* Has predictable melee crits with his melee weapon

* Builds low-profile

* Very reliant on aiming spray based and single-shot based hitscan weapons


**Their roles in a team are...**

* Direct front-line support.

* Offensive flanking.

* Area control and Visual Deterrence

* Providing support fire for front-liners

* Exploiting opportunities or weaknesses in enemy defense.

* Supporting friendly engineers with building or repairing buildings.

* Providing extensive dialogue about how much he loves his little gun.

**They excel at...**

* Fighting enemy light classes and pyros

* Keeping front-line allies in the fight longer.

* Assisting friendly players in direct front-line combat.

* Raising team combat awareness.

**They are vulnerable to...**

* Snipers. Despite their new found freedom

* Soldiers. While soldiers can easily be distracted by mini-sentries

* Demomen. Their high explosive capacity makes it somewhat challenging for Gunslingers to effectively distract demomen.

* Heavies. The high health pool and high rate of fire sported by the heavy makes him the hardest thing for a Gunslinger to tackle alone.


**A few words on the Gunslinger Engineer...**

The Gunslinger Engineer requires a very different play style from the traditional engineer. The mini-sentries make it impossible to establish the same stopping force that the traditional engineer has

***You MUST have a Gunslinger wrench in order to play as a Gunslinger Engineer. You can receive one as an achievement item by completing 11 Engineer Achievements.*** 

On to the guide.

-----

**The Setup**

As an engineer

The dispenser should be put in a covered place in or close to the front line

-----

**The Shotgun**

Gunslingers rely more on their primary and secondary weapons more than their traditional cousins, is deceptively powerful.


**2 full(10 pellets) shots or 1 critical of the shotgun will kill ALL of the following in close range:**

* Demoman
* Pyros
* Medics
* Snipers
* Engineers
* Scouts
* Spies

**3 shots(1 crit + 1 shot) will kill...**

* Anyone above with an overheal

* Soldiers

**4 shots(2 crits

* Heavies 

* Overhealed Soldiers

**5 shots (2+ crits + 1 shot

-----

***The Side Arm*** 

The Pistol is often the best weapon for the Gunslinger engineer, the pistol is extremely dangerous, but it really shines when it is used against weakened players that are fleeing, or while you are fleeing.

**Close range shots deal 22 damage per shot**.  7 shots will kill light classes. A full clip will kill everyone but the heavy.

**At medium range the pistol deals 13 to 17 damage**

**At maximum range


The Wrangler and Short Circuit are other options for secondaries

-----

***The Mini-Sentry Overview***

* You can still only build one sentry at a time.

* Costs **100 metal to create**(Full metal allows you to create two sentries)

* Comes out of its toolbox with full health(**100 health**)

* Fires 50% faster than a level 1 sentry

* Deals **8 damage per hit**

* Enemies in the mini-sentry's firing range may experience trouble aiming due to the constant

* The mini-sentry cannot be repaired or upgraded.

* Collecting enemy weapons causes engineers to gain 100 metal

-----

***Ways to use the sentry...***

**Offensively**

* **The Snake in the Grass** - Hidden/Ambushing Sentry

Placing hidden sentries at the flanks or rear of enemies can allow for a quick, piles of boxes, barrels, water, high window lips and other various map features to hide your mini-sentry from early detection.**  

Similar to that other snake in the grass(The Spy)


* **The Red Herring** - Distraction

Gunslingers should be able to flick down a mini-sentry in the blink of an eye.  While you're in the fray of battle, Black Box or Liberty Launcher Soldiers, Demomen with shields) will frequently exhaust a good bit of their ammo against your sentry.  

**Approach while they have limited or no loaded ammo and feed them some of the good stuff from your shotgun or pistol. **

This is also very effective against pyros, or try to burst the pyro down with the shotgun.  

Pyros tend to be relatively easy kills to make as a gunslinger


* **The Wild Goose Chase** - Damage Source Confusion

If you can get your sentry in a high or hidden places, it is devastating to light classes who spend too long trying to figure out what's going on(48 DPS + your pistol shots is quite a bit of damage to them)

-----

**Defensively **

* **The Canary** - Incoming/Flank Alarm

Placing your mini-sentry in crucial flanking areas(For instance

If someone destroys your sentry, and what you can expect when you go to investigate.  Relaying that to your team is helpful.  

Spies also seem to love sapping these things.  Don't bother trying to save it

* **The Watchdog** - Visual Deterrence

A bold, they will feel this tiny pup's bite.

Hardier classes will have less problems dealing with it

* **The Lizard's Tail** - Sacrificial Escape

**When you're up to your cowboy boots in hot water

In other words, they'll suffer considerable damage while they chase you.  If they choose to kill it, that's a few shots they can't use against you, and a few more seconds to get away.  

This is particularly good with snipers that camp specific lines of sight.  Drop a mini-sentry in their line of sight(preferably while in cover) and wait until he shoots it.  The sniper has a relatively long reload on his sniper rifle,False,,t5_2rbtk,False,,,t3_k5mv5

**A few words on the Soldier...**

The soldier is a well rounded offensive minded class.  They excel in nearly all forms of combat(except melee, and becomes increasingly better the more experience you have with the class.

Their immense load out versatility makes them one of the most flexible classes in the game.  While the majority of their unlocks are still offensive minded

On to the guide.


**The Soldier's Rockets**


The primary weapon of the soldier is his prized rocket launcher.  This weapon is a **straight firing** death machine. The rocket launcher, since **the explosion can also hurt you** if they're too close.  (You take less damage from your own explosives, though.)

**In mid and long range fights is where the soldier's rockets shine.**  While it is true that they deal reduced damage to more distant targets, you can easily rack up **192-240 in a full load**.   This is useful for **softening up enemies** before a full team push, or **discouraging players from pushing**.



**Crockets**

The rocket launcher's criticals(AKA Crockets) deal enormous damage to people caught in their blast radius

If you're out of rockets(or against a pyro



**The Shotgun**


Some swear by it.  Others live and die by it.  The shotgun is used by 4 different classes(Heavy, if you're curious), and it doesn't change in between them.  **A full meatshot**(All of the pellets hit) with the shotgun causes roughly **90 damage** and is often the demise of players who get too weak near, or too close to the soldier.   

The shotgun, bringing in **a meager 3 points of damage per pellet** at a distance.



**Melee**  


They have it.  It works



On to the tricks.




***Rocket Jumping***

Rocket jumping is a fundamental skill of any soldier.  It allows soldiers to reach areas they otherwise wouldn't be able to on foot or by jumping, or by various *roll out* techniques to propel them to the front line.

To perform a basic rocket jump

You probably didn't go very far just doing that

If you're not interested in the full details

* Rocket jumping injures you.  Before attempting any jump
* Jump and crouch as you fire the rocket at your feet
* Firing rockets varying degrees behind you will cause you to travel more forward and less upwards.  Use this to limit your fall damage
* You can fire rockets against walls while jumping and crouching to send you flying away from the wall. Use this
* Use these basic techniques to get into high or unusual places to attack from
* Always look before you rocket jump.  You might be jumping to your death.
* Rocket jumps can be useful for bombarding enemies
* Don't forget that rocket jumps aren't just for use for attacking enemies.  You can also use it to flee to safety

**The Benefits of Custom Keybinds.**

* Reduced (human) error when performing certain tasks.
* Faster response time/less (human) hesitation
* Flexible to anyone's play style or favorite class.
* Simplifies communication for players who do not own a mic.


**A few words on custom keybinds...**

Custom keybinds allow players to simplify tasks using CFG files.  Players that utilize these features often find that their controls are more intuitive and will fit their play style far closer than the original controls.  While creating custom keybinds isn't for everyone

***Getting started***

First

For you oldschool 32bitters...

**""C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\(YOURUSERNAME)\team fortress 2\tf\cfg""**

or for you stylin' 64bit users...

**C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\(YOURUSERNAME)\team fortress 2\tf\cfg**


This is your config folder and contains

You can open and edit these files using notepad.  If you've never done this before

The language is simple.  There are a few basics you need to know to complete this.

**Commands**

* **Bind**  

This command is the key(Hur) of everything.  Its syntax(how it is written to work in a cfg file) looks like this.

&gt;**Bind ""(Name of Key)"" ""(Command to use when the key when pressed"")**

Here's a real life example:

&gt;**Bind ""Mouse1"" ""+attack""**

This **bind** makes mouse1(That's your left mouse button) use the +attack command

*[Here's a list of your keys](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Bind#Keybinds) and how they're written in the CFG file.*

* **Alias**

Told you we'd come back to this

An **alias** is a way of shortening a command(or more importantly

This is the syntax:

&gt;**alias ""(A name you create)"" ""(command#1);(command#2);(command#3);(etc

Here's a real life example:

&gt;**alias ""GameOver"" ""slot1; taunt; wait 300; explode""**

This alias(when assigned to a button, wait 300 frames(Which I'll cover later), and make you explode like you ate a lemon off of one of Cave Johnson's trees.


* **[Voicemenu](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Bind#Voice_commands)**

Syntax:

&gt;**Voicemenu (Menu Number

Example:

&gt;**Voicemenu 1 1 **

This will make your character shout ""SPY!""

* **Build** and **Destroy**

Syntax:

&gt;**Build (building number)**

&gt;**Destroy (building number)**

Example:

&gt; **Build 0**

""Erecting a dispenser!""

From the TF2 wiki:

&gt; 0: Dispenser

&gt; 1: Teleporter Entrance

&gt; 2: Sentry Gun/Minisentry

&gt; 3: Teleporter Exit

These commands will

* **[Disguise](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Bind#Quick_Spy_disguises)**

Syntax:

&gt; **Disguise (class number) (Team color number)**

Example:

&gt; **Disguise 1 -1**

This will disguise you as an enemy scout.  By the way, and stick to -1 and -2 for determining your disguises, since you won't always be against the same colored team.


***Commands without Arguments***

(That's commands that don't need extra stuff after them)

* **Slot1

These commands cause your weapon to change to the respected slot.   They are represented with simply ""Slot1""

* **+Attack

Your primary and secondary fire commands.  

***A quick note about the + and - commands:***

**+** commands will continue to function until they are released with a **-** command.  When you are creating a CFG file of your own

* **+Duck**

Causes you to crouch.

* **Jump**

*Boing!*

**wtf is spycheck?**

Spychecking is the act of checking if the guy next to you is a spy.

**kk so how do i spycheck???**

There are many ways to spycheck. There are different ways to do it. Here is a list of the most common strategies in order of easiest to hardest:

* **PYRO**: The easiest. With your flamethrower, I've heard that instead of going out, flaming disguised teammates blast backwards like a teammate.
* **EVERYONE**: You can't go through them. You only can go through teammates
* **EVERYONE**: You see a person named as your In Game Name (IGN). ***IT'S A SPY*** disguised as you.
* **EVERYONE**: They don't shoot. 
* **EVERYONE**: They die on one hit. You deal 6 damage with your shotgun, keep shooting in that distance to ignite him.
* **EVERYONE**: They move faster/slower than their class. See an abnormally slow Scout? **IT'S A SPY.** (EDIT: This only applies to Medics and Scouts
* **ENGINEER**: An ally walks up to you and your buildings. WHAM, or risk another sapper if you are dead, or destroy the sapper first, if you are Companion Cube'd (really attached) to your Sentry.
* **SPY***(oh the irony)*: With your knife out
* **SNIPERS/SCOUTS**: Items which deal bleed
* **MEDIC**: You don't get ubercharge when healing. This is a good time to get your saw out and kill him. You also get the achievement ""FYI I Am a Medic"".

Those are the most common ways. There are way more others. If you are intrested

**so how do u get betta at spychecking??????//**

The easiest way to get better at spychecking, you should know what a disguised spy acts like. Use that when playing other classes.

That concludes my guide. If there are any better/more common ways to spycheck

Now, then you've come to the right place. If you're here to judge my abilities, don't downvote (it's a self, redditor, I'm not getting Karma, so why downvote?) but comment below as to why you think something is wrong etc. and I'll make amendments. :) The discussion will always help people who are unsure about things!

**What is an item?**
An item is something that is in your backpack. You can access this at any time by pressing N during a game, enabling you to equip the items you already have.

**What can you do with them?**
You can equip them to a class, or you can trade them.

**What do items do
The items can provide stat bonuses, the Wrangler allows you to point your sentry gun wherever you want, but will give it a 2 second downtime whenever you switch to another weapon. Most weapons are better than others, some worse, but a majority are side-grades, where the benefits are pretty much equal to the cons.

Equip items:
These are either weapons, shoes, food, or hats!

Usable items:
These are paints, name/description tags, and duels.

**What is the point in hats?**
You wear them.

**....is that it?**
YES. That's it. They're a sign of the blood sweat and tears/money you put into making/buying that hat. Some people don't like hats, similar to the bonuses of individual items, but without any stats being lowered.

**What are Strange Weapons
Strange weapons are variations of different weapons. These variations track how many kills you have with that one weapon, and the name becomes more and more dangerous. The most popular of the Strange Weapons series is the Strange Shotgun, as it can be used by the Soldier, Pyro, Heavy, and Engineer, and is the only Strange Weapon that can be used by more than 2 classes. They do not provide any stat bonuses other than the ones that the regular version of the weapon would provide. (as of 6/30/2011) It seems the only way to get Strange Weapons at the moment is through trading or through a Series 19, or 21 crate. (Thanks

**How do I get items?**
There are a number of ways to get items:

1. ~~Items are dropped randomly every 15 to 75 minutes of play. Valve says it depends on how much you play a week, F2P I don't know how many you can get in a week)~~

Kryhavok says:
&gt;You will receive drops at a rate of 1 every 30-70 minutes for up to ~10 hours of gameplay. Therefore
Apparently, the next week you'll have 10-10 + whatever you had left from last week.



2. Buying them from the Mann Co. Store. These items, and also are not trade-able for the first few days. You can buy things from the store by adding funds to your Steam wallet.

3. Trading. You can find someone that will give you an item for free maybe

4. Achievements. Each class has 3 achievement milestones, it used to be the ONLY way to get items. The number varies from class to class. These milestones will each unlock one item for that class.
If you want to unlock these items quickly, maps that are designed to make achievement earning a lot easier. Sure, it's a crappy way to do it, but it's how I did it, back when it started. But if you do it that way, there will always be proof that you did in your scores. For example, my longest time alive was an hour and a half

**I want items faster/more items
Well there are a number of ways:

1. Achievement/Idle Servers. Idle servers basically kill you constantly, and alt tab and browse Reddit. Sure, it's another one of those things that people will say ""YOU'RE SO LAZY WHY DON'T YOU JUST PLAY?"" Well I don't feel like playing, so I'm idling. Also going on Achievement servers will speed up how quickly you get achievements, and therefore how quickly you unlock the achievement-based items.

2. Scam people out of their items. I'm not saying you should

3. Spend money in the Mann Co. store. Yeah

4. Spend money in the Mann Co. Store, for 5 bucks, (minimum Steam Wallet addition) you can increase the items you pick up in a week by 10. Just make a new account, find another computer, install TF2, buy something from the Mann Co. Store to make it a premium account, idle, you can rake in 50 items a week. How about that?

**How do I not get scammed
There are some key examples:

1. Never ""lend"" someone an item, then don't lend the item. If you do this, they could just disappear from your friends list, and could just play on a different server etc. and you will never see said item again.

2. Make sure that it is the item you want. For example, and not just a shotgun that has a name tag and description tag on it (I know you can't trade shotguns, but it still applies to other Strange Weapons) Name and Description Tags both use quotation marks around the name of whatever the user decides to use on the tag, making it easy to recognize.

3. Before thinking about answering someone on a trade server, some people seem to think that earbuds are worth something like 4 reclaimed metal, whereas some people think they aren't worth anything at all. Of course it's all down to your decision, but think about what you think the item is worth, with some help from other people. Furthermore, don't trust what the other person says they are worth. They could be lying, saying their weapon is worth ten times what it actually is. Because you will easily be able to find someone who would trade you the same item for a better deal. Even if you've traded with them before.

4. Don't think that a Vintage Weapon is something special. Every now and again, but it doesn't really change it's worth. This is more of a personal thing for me because I don't see the point, BUT still.

5. Don't trade hats. Ever.

**What happens if I do get scammed? How do I get my item(s) back?**
Unfortunately

**What is Crafting?**
Crafting is changing multiple unwanted items into one wanted item.

**How do I craft items?**
In the screen which shows all the classes, the crafting icon, etc. click the crafting icon. Then, choose what you want to craft, and if you have the items for it, you can craft the item. This will permanently destroy the items you used to craft, and give you a brand new item that you want to craft. This is irreversible (except with Scrap, and Refined metal).

**What are Slot and Class Tokens
These are tokens representing one of the nine classes, Melee, and PDA (Watches etc. for Spies)) You use one slot, one class, and one scrap metal to craft a weapon for that one slot and that one class. You can also use the class token to make a class specific hat.

**Scrap Metal? What is that?**
It's what you get when you craft two weapons together. Basically.

If you want to find out what you need for a particular item before you go to the crafting menu

I intend for this to be as helpful as possible, and this guide intends to help the general knowledge about that. I am by no means a good writer, and there is an abundance of information I do not know, therefore I am asking those in the Reddit community who can help contribute to contribute. Hope this helps!

**The Basics**
In its simplest terms, as playing the game results in dropped weapons; one could think of playing the game as work, and the weapon drops as a salary, albeit one worth very little. Weapons can either be equipped or crafted into scrap metal. Scrap metal represents the next tier up from weapons, as 2 weapons of the same class (for example, 2 random soldier weapons) can be used to create a scrap metal. Keep in mind that this process cannot be reversed, once a scrap is created, people will use either items they don’t want or items they have extras of to create scrap. So what can you do with scrap? Usually, as many items are valued in refined metal. Things will often be sold for parts of refined metal, as it is worth 1/3rd of a reclaimed metal. If you are buying a hat (also

Tl; dr:
2 weapons -&gt; 1 scrap metal
3 scrap metal -&gt; 1 reclaimed metal (6 weapons)
3 reclaimed metal -&gt; 1 refined metal (18 weapons)

**It’s worth MONEY?**
Now that you have some refined metal, Mann Co. Supply Keys, are available from the Team Fortress 2 store on Steam. They are sold for $2.49, however, only very rarely will you pay this much for each key. You can typically find them for under $2.00. Each key is worth around 2.33-2.66 refined, depending on the trader. What this means is that all those random weapon drops you’re getting can eventually be worth real money. While some of you go celebrate, let’s take a few moments to figure this whole thing out. WARNING: BASIC MATH LESSON AHEAD. (Happy now?)  Assuming that you’re buying a key for 2.66 refined, that’s 48 dropped weapons. Assuming that you get 8 drops a week
So what are keys for? Typically they are used as a price guide for items, trade them for other items, or open crates.

Tl; dr:
2 weapons -&gt; 1 scrap metal
3 scrap metal -&gt; 1 reclaimed metal (6 weapons)
3 reclaimed metal -&gt; 1 refined metal (18 weapons)
~2.66 refined -&gt; 1 key (48 weapons)
1 key -&gt; ~$2.00

**Dem crates**
Alongside weapons, and will return either an item of “Strange” quality, hats, paints, or unusual hats. Some older crates may also drop regular weapons. Strange quality weapons are worth more than their regular counterparts, and hats each have a value in refined, while unusual hats have values in keys. Some crates can be worth a lot, so it’s up to you to decide if its worth it. Remember that the item received from each crate is determined when you open the crate

Tl; dr:
Crates can only be opened with keys
Crates drop weapons
Some crates can be worth more than other crates

**Promotional items**
Promo items, or Max’s Head’s are worth multiple keys. This is due to the fact that there are only a limited amount of these in the game. Promotional items are typically given out for preordering certain games, or for other limited time events. For example, Bill’s Hat’s were given to the people who preordered Left 4 Dead 2. Because of the limited nature of these items, they are worth quite a bit. They are commonly used as currency for high cost trades. The most common promo items are: Bill’s Hat’s, Earbuds, and Max’s Head’s. At the time of this writing, Earbuds are worth around 19-22 keys, keep them to brag about, happens to be decreasing

Tl; dr:
7-9 keys -&gt; Bill’s Hat
2.5 Bill’s Hats -&gt; 1 Earbud( ~21 keys)
2 Earbuds -&gt; Max’s Head (4-5 Bill’s Hats or ~40 keys)
The price (in keys) of these items is currently decreasing.

**Hats
Hats. The only purpose for trading in the TF2 economy. If you have a hat you are a good player. If you don’t, uncrating, crafting, or trading.

1326452071.0,ofbhh,4 Golden Rules of Medics and their patients (And 4 Myths),chopsoy0,40,0,30,"This is aimed at new to intermediate players (&lt;6 months). This is for people who know what's going on in the game but don't know how to optimize their performance

## Golden Rules


**DO. NOT. DIE.**

*  Medics are the most important people on the team

*  Your position as medic is much more important than any other class. I would happily sacrifice two scouts, and a heavy to save a medic. Assume that everyone on your team is an idiot unless otherwise noted, do not follow scouts and spies as they flank. Do not follow suicide jumper soldiers. Do not follow anyone who is willing to take the two of you into a nest of enemies. Stay with your TEAM, not one person.

**Heal heal heal

*  This should be a no brainer, and spamming flames in his face, waiting for him to switch his medic beam from his overhealed buddy to my 15hp lifebar, with no results as enemy soldier jumps us both with rockets.

*  Heal EVERYONE. That means you want your beam fixed on the person with the lowest health. Your role here is to make sure everyone on your team has extremely low health but nobody ever dies. A heavy with 15hp is still a heavy with $12

*  This should be your heal priority:
   1.  People with red health on fire
   2.  Other medics
   3.  People with red health
   4.  People on fire
   5.  People slightly hurt
   6.  Overhealed people

*  Notice I've put ""other medics"" on top, burning medic with red health and the other medic wouldn't heal you. When you heal a medic, you're not just healing a person. You're healing a pool. Every 1 point you heal on a medic is 5 points healed on another teammate. That medic can then be more aggressive and take more damage. Heal them ESPECIALLY when their ubercharges are high. Make sure you have constant healing if they've popped kritz.

**Watch for flanks

*  Make it a habit to swing 180 and back every 5 seconds. Spies can strike at any point (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2tV91UJjXQ). Your patient will be distracted by things in front 10 feet of you two, demo/soldiers that have jumped you, hidden sentries when you're ubered, and especially snipers far away waiting for your uber to wear off. Tell your teammate to back off before the uber finishes, if necessary.

*  After some experience you'll identify the unique screams that people make when they die by a melee weapon. This is a usually because of a spy's backstab. Take some time to either memorize or rebind the voice commands for ""Sentry ahead"", ""Help"", and ""Incoming"". If your patient doesn't respond to your tips, leave him to die, he's not worth getting the both of you killed.

**Follow uber

*  This applies for everyone, knocked back by sentires, pushed by demomen, and later killed by the C&amp;D spy in the back. They'll need all of your help as they clear out the sentry nest, the teleporter exit, and bags of meat in between. The best thing is, they'll soak up all the damage. 

*  All of enemies will be distracted, spies can flank the sides and back and pick off engineers and medics. Soldiers can get rid of any stickies and pyros. Other medics, heavies, demos can follow suit and add firepower. Engies can set up minisentries or move some gear up. Snipers can reposition and headshot some people who are too distracted to dodge.

## Common Myths

**You popped uber too early

*  There's no such thing as a wasted uber. Even if you use it on a spy/sniper, or be saved from death. That said, there are more efficient ways to use ubers. If you popped just a bit early and don't get any kills, it's still enough to push the enemy line back through intimidation, and allow your teammates to move up and get a better position. Always pop your uber if death is imminent (pop it don't drop it). At least it saves you a trip back to your spawn and 20 seconds of not charging your next uber.

*  When you get an uber

**Medics should use the needle gun/blautsauger/ubersaw/bonesaw given the circumstances (self-defence).**

*  If you're new to the game (&lt;6 months) I recommend you don't fight back under any circumstances at all. The reason is because unless you've played FPSs your entire life

**Medics should be in the front lines

*  Medics heal fresh wounds a LOT slower than old wounds. Valve added this mechanic to encourage falling back. You can do a lot more good for your  team healing more DPS. In the front lines, you're visible to the other team, and everyone will be aiming for you. You should be in a position where you can barely see the enemy team, while your patient can see two or three of them. You should be about halfway between the front lines and the nearest dispenser.

*  That said

**Medics are a support class**

*  False. Medics are a carry class. Entire team without a medic is baby team and easily crushed. Medics should always be in the top of the scoreboard. Remember you get most of your points from healing (1pt per 600hp) and ubers (1pt). Even if you don't get assists, make a boundary for how far you will or won't go, know where you can fall back, and stay with your team.

*  Assume that everyone on your team is an idiot and not worth dying for

## Lastly: Bonus! - A chart of heal priorities by class:

1.  Other medics
2.  Soldiers / Demo
3.  Heavies
4.  Scouts / Pyros / Spies
5.  Engies / Snipers (They can go find a dispenser)

**51 Signs of a Spy**

*Obvious Spy Guide Makes Spies Obvious*

 

Be on the lookout for these behaviors.  They’re often a sign that you have a spy on your hands.

##Non-class specific

* Looking at you
* They are lined up
* Someone is not firing in areas with easy ammo access(Esp. near dispensers)
* Someone is on the cart
* More than one person is on a point
* Someone is sitting in a corner for no particular reason.
* Someone at full health waiting for health to respawn.
* Health/Ammo/Weapons suddenly vanishing without anyone nearing it(Not really behavior
* The person is carrying non-primary weapons.
* The person is wearing a particularly rare hat(Easier if you know where the other person is)
* There are two people with the same name
* Anyone calling out medic with more health than their “MEDIC!” icon indicates. IE: Dark red icon when they’re mid to full health.
* Anyone of a class not specifically held by other members.
* They don’t seem to die when hit with massive amounts of enemy fire.
* They don’t react to enemy attacks
* They are ignored by enemy players when they are particularly easy kills. IE: Medics/engineers/snipers right next to demos/pyros
* They are burning and glowing a different color
* They are evasive to your team or your team’s attacks. Especially evasive of pyros.

-------------------------------

##Class specific

**Snipers:**

* Not scoped in
* Near
* Moving forward/backwards a lot. Snipers mainly strafe.

**Engineers:**

* Not near their gear
* Coming from the front line
* Doesn’t remove sappers from buildings
* Isn’t using a wrench near gear

**Scouts:**

* Moving slowly

**Pyro:**

* Not puffing flame.
* Is on fire. Pyros don’t burn. (Useful for spotting enemy spies disguised as pyros on their own team)
* Using the shotgun or axe at long range.
* Using the flaregun and (sometimes) axe in short range.
* Running away from the front line with full health.

**Heavy:**

* Remaining at long range for extended periods of time. (Though this could just be them being inexperienced)
* Staying behind players for long periods of time.
* Not taking damage from enemy fire(Worth noting
* Using ‘fists’ whenever not using the Gloves of Running Urgently.
* Running slow still when using the GLoves of Running Urgently
* Runs away from fights with full health

**Soldier:**

* Not firing their rockets for long periods of time
* Capable of being healed even when the equalizer is out.
* Does not move fasters with equalizer out while injured.
* Runs away from fights with full health

**Demoman:**

* Using melee weapon at long range.
* Not spamming grenades/stickies.
* No stickies in general area while a demoman is present. (Odd
* Runs away from fights with full health

**Medic:**

* Not healing.
* Running slightly slower than usual. A bit harder to notice than the scout. The healing bit is a bigger indicator.

**Spy:**

* Not revealing himself to you by attacking.
* Not disguised as a friendly while near your team(Though he just may be a less experienced spy)
* Not moving as slowly as his disguised class should be.
* Hangs around other friendlies while disguised too long (Spys give themselves away by being too close to their actual allies.)",,t5_2rbtk,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/rjmaw/51_signs_of_a_spy_obvious_spy_guide_makes_spies/

I decided to change things up a bit with this guide.  There are things we know we don't know

-----

**Control Points and Payload Carts**

Control Points each have their own amount of time required to capture.  In **Attack/Defend** maps(Like Dustbowl

In **Control Point** games, and the third(also known as the 'mid point') capture the slowest.

Control points can be captured by numerous individuals at a time to increase how quickly the point is captured. 

* **1st Person**: 100% capture rate 
* **2nd Person**: 150% capture rate **(+50%)**
* **3rd Person**: 183% capture rate **(+33%)**
* **4th Person**: 208% capture rate **(+25%)**

And it continues to decrease with each additional person.  Generally, such as the Soldier and Demoman, and there are other opportunities to gain an advantage on your enemy's team, such as clearing the way to the following points before they can recover from that capture.

**Payload carts** and **Payload Race carts** behave a bit differently.  As you're capturing them

**Their capture rates are limited to 3 people**

If after 30 seconds your team(Generally blue) doesn't touch the cart

In Payload Race maps

**Did you know?:** The final control point in the Well Map can be captured in 2 seconds by a single person?  *Get. On. The. Point

-----

**Respawning**

**Players respawn in waves.**  The default wave time is 10 seconds, disabling or skipping deathcams does not make you spawn faster.)  Many players will have to wait more than one respawn wave, making the maximum wait time to respawn 20 seconds on servers without mods.  All respawn times are altered slightly, based on the population on the server. (Lower population usually means faster respawns.)

Some map types offer altered spawn times depending on a variety of factors

In most **Attack and Defend** game types, as it will only become harder to defeat Blue once they start making captures.

In game types where both teams have the option to attack or defend

-----

**Damage Modifiers**

Damage changes for a number of reasons.  First off, which can only be used up close)

**Damage increases when...**

* You are closer to the enemy(150% damage
* When you attack enemies vulnerable to your damage type due to their choice in load out(Fire, melee, etc.)
* When you land a critical hit(300% damage).
* When you land a mini-crit (133% damage)

**Damage decreases when...** 

* Your target is protected by the Battalion's Backup buff.
* Your target is more resilient to your types of damage due to their load out.
* You are far away from the enemy(50% damage
* You hit the enemy indirectly(Splash damage) or partially(not all pellets hit)

-----

**Crit and Mini-crit Mechanics**

Critical hits and mini-critical hits **both ignore damage fall off**

Mini-crits can still benefit from damage ramp up, since their damage is a full 300%.

Mini-crits and crits do not work together

Mini-crits boosts can only be applied by altered loadouts(Such as Jarate, etc.)  The only exception to this is the Pyro's air blast, which has a chance of turning regular rockets and grenades into mini-crits rockets and grenades.

Critical hits can be granted by a number of boosts, and Humiliation mode.   Critical hits **can also be predicted** by a variety of weapons and techniques, such as the Pyro's Axtinguisher crits, the Engineer's Frontier Justice crits.

Critical hits can also be randomly awarded to weapons that can receive them.  Standard weapons(Primary and secondary) **have a base 2% chance to crit when fired**.  

**High rate of fire weapons** such as the Mini-gun, they last for 2 seconds while they continue to fire.

Melee weapons receive a base chance of 15% to critically hit

**Your critical hit chance is modified by how much damage you do within 20 seconds.**  The more damage you deliver, to 10% additional chance to crit(12% for standard weapons, 25% for melee weapons) at 800 damage.  These numbers are reset if you die.

-----

**Charge Rates**

Medics charge their uber at varying rates.  Healing damaged players

Players at 150% health(Max overheal) will only charge the medic's uber by 1.25% per second .  Players receiving healing from multiple sources(Such as a second medic

Both the Kritzrieg and the Quick Fix build their charges 25% faster than the stock Medigun.

During setup

At the rate of 2.5% per second

Medics also charge by using the Ubersaw.  While it is common knowledge that the Ubersaw builds a charge on hit

**Heavy Overview:**

* Has an enormous health pool (300 health)
* Has the largest hit box of any other class.
* Slower than other classes.
* Even slower while firing his mini-gun
* Devastating to enemies caught in bullet spray.
* Must 'wind up* his mini gun before firing.
* Stock Weapons include: Mini-gun
* Different load out options grant him the ability to heal himself or other players, slow enemy players caught in the bullet spray, and more.

The Heavy's Roles on a Team:

* Defending points.
* Providing continuous cover fire. 
* Holding down front lines with other front line classes(Demos
* Guarding choke points.
* Ambushing enemy players.
* Protecting other team members by soaking damage
* Capturing enemy points using brute force.

They are vulnerable to...

* Terrain disadvantages (Low or distant terrain)
* Peeking explosive users (Soldiers or demos using cover)
* Snipers (They have big heads)
* Spies (They're slow and easy to catch)

Now that you have a general idea of what the heavy is


**Overheal Maintaining**

In defensive capacities, or until you take the damage required to remove it.  

**Squatting**

Against other heavies, you stand to be hit less often when they are used against you.

**Jump-Winding**

You move slower as your gun is winding or firing.  You can circumvent this slightly by jumping as you begin to wind your gun.  This is fantastic for rounding corners that may have enemies on the other side of them.  With your gun pre-wound as you leap into the open

**Tunnel camping**

If you have resources available to you, and doesn't have many sources of cover, you can void it in seconds.

**Sandvich Drop**

The alternative fire mechanism on the sandvich drops the sandvich on a plate, drop the sandvich for a very quick restoration of health.

**Heavy Bomb**

Using the Gloves of Running Urgently, this technique is mildly suicidal, but can pay off big if executed against dwindling enemy numbers.

**The Heavy-Medic Bomb**

Using the gloves of running again, or his life becomes endangered, to use the uber.  This is effective even against well defended points when properly done.  Once you are ubered and in your prime range, fill the area with bullets and watch your enemies scatter.  Be careful against teams that have pyros within the area, as their airblasts can send you flying out of your best range.  Consider using flanking paths in order to get the better drop on your enemy.

**Heavy is turtle!**

Using the Fists of Steel melee weapon, limits your effective area to be hit as well as reducing damage once you are hit.  This can also be used to act as a human shield for enemies who are trying to dispatch sentries while under the effects of ubercharges or too distant to reliably shoot down.

**Heavy is Train Engine!**

Heavies firing and crouched cannot move.  However, allowing them to reduce their effective hit area, have infinite ammo and continuous healing, all while moving.  This, however, can result in becoming an easier target for enemy snipers.


**Recommended Key Binds:**

* Quick Sandvich Drop:

This will bind a command that will swap to your sandvich and drop it.  This particular example assumes you have a navigation mouse(With a built in ""Back"" and ""Forward"" buttons)

&gt;Alias ""+sandvich"" ""slot2; +attack2""

&gt;Alias ""-sandvich"" ""-attack2""

&gt;Bind ""MOUSE4"" ""sandvich""

* Activate Ubercharge!

If you lack a mic

&gt;Bind ""MOUSE5"" ""voicemenu 1 6""

* Thanks! Good job!

Be sure to always thank your medics

Thanks!:

&gt;Bind ""F1"" ""voicemenu 0 1""

Good Job!

&gt;Bind ""F2"" ""Voicemenu 2 7""


**Recommended Load Outs and Items**

***Loadout #1:***

* Primary: Mini-Gun or Tomislav. 
* Secondary: Sandvich
* Melee: Gloves of Running Urgently.

**Pros: **
Speed and survivability.  This load out works well both in defensive and offensive capacities and works well with every tactic listed here.

**Cons:**
Relies exclusively on the Mini-gun/Tomislav to fight.  Once you're out of ammo, and collecting ammo from people you kill.

***Loadout #2***

* Primary: Tomislav
* Secondary: Stock Shotgun or Family Business
* Melee: Killing Gloves of Boxing

**Pros: **
The Tomislav and shotgun combined with the killing gloves of boxing can provide enormous situational damage.  If a careless player is caught offguard and killed with melee hits

**Cons:**
The Tomislav and Killing Gloves of Boxing both have 20% slower firing rates.  While the Tomislav's penalty is offset by its rapid windup and silent spin

***Loadout #3***

* Primary: Brass Beast
* Secondary: Sandvich
* Melee: Fists of Steel

**Pros: **
This loadout makes you a metallic defense minded heavy.  Combine with easy access to a dispenser or other source of health and ammo, the wind-up penalty is not quite as severe.  The Fists of Steel allow you to soak damage while you escape if things go wrong, or can help soak damage from a sentry getting hit by an ubered player, or players too distant to deal with immediately.

**Cons:**
Unfortunately, use the Fists of Steel cautiously against ranged opponents only, stand on the point, and defend friendly engineers who are providing you the health and ammo.  Swapping to the shotgun over the sandvich grants some mobility while still maintaining the ability to return fire.

1351379788.0,12707y,PSA: What in the Merasmus is with Halloween this year?,Lapper,42,4,19,"For those who are NewToTF2

**Abstract**

Join us in the brand new spooky KOTH Ghost Fort and creepy MVM Wave 666 maps to participate in the 4th Annual Scream Fortress Spectral Halloween Special! Fight zombies

**Basics**

The Halloween event occurs annually and centers around collecting limited-edition items and fighting a boss. Most items earned during the Halloween event come with a Halloween restriction, can be modified to allow you to wear your costume all year round. Let's take a look at what previous years brought us.

* 2009: *cp_harvest_event: ""Harvest Event""* &amp;mdash; No boss
* 2010: *cp_manor_event: ""Mann Manor""* &amp;mdash; The Horseless Headless Horsemann
* 2011: *koth_viaduct_event: ""Eyeaduct""* &amp;mdash; Monoculus

Players from both teams must band together or die horribly to the hands of the ridiculously powerful boss, is a Halloween item of your very own.

These old maps are reactivated every Halloween. What does that entail?

* Fun cosmetic Halloween-themed health and ammo pickups
* Pumpkin Bombs
* Critical pumpkins
* Haunted Halloween Gifts

**Ghost Fort**

*koth_lakeside_event*

This is a modified version of Lakeside which houses the new boss, to imbue an effect on everyone in the server for a short time. The following list of effects is courtesy of TF2Wiki:

&gt; * ÜberCharges makes every player invulnerable. Because of this
&gt; * Critboosts grants 100% critical chance on each player. 
&gt; * Low Gravity lowers the map gravity
&gt; * High Jumps makes every player jump much higher. This does not affect fall damage. 
&gt; * Bigger Heads will cause every players' heads to grow larger. This makes them easy targets for Snipers. Their vocals will be low pitched as well. 
&gt; * Smaller Heads will shrink every players' heads. This increases their vocal pitching and will make them harder to headshot. 
&gt; * Skulls are negative effects and will either ignite every player, or spawn ghosts that encircle the area around the control point. 
&gt; * Super Speed makes every player run faster.
&gt; * Dance teleports every player to the control point and aligns them into two vertical rows

This all makes for a very hectic environment, from which death is the only escape.

But let's talk about Merasmus. Once again

&gt; Merasmus will spawn on Ghost Fort's control point every few minutes when there are at least 10 players playing on the server. The players have 1 minute and 30 seconds to defeat him before he leaves. While he is alive

&gt;When Merasmus spawns, and can teleport throughout the map on random intervals. Merasmus can melee players with his staff, roll bombs at them, and perform a magic attack which sets selected targets on fire and launches them skyward. Merasmus can also use an attack far less often than his other attacks, in which he hovers over the control point and uses the Bombinomicon to spread bombs a wide range around the control point. Whenever Merasmus is hovering in the air while performing this attack, all damage dealt to him will be critical hits.

&gt;Every time Merasmus teleports to another location on the map, it will stun him, stopping him in his tracks, and the player who transported the bomb will become invulnerable, speed boosted, and crit boosted for a short time. If the player fails to reach Merasmus in time, the bomb will detonate, those show up on the killfeed and grant the player a point. At all times while stunned

&gt;At certain points in the battle, distinguishing them from background elements. If an incorrect prop is destroyed, it will drop a large Halloween pumpkin, which any player can collect. If the correct prop is destroyed, Merasmus will reappear and may be stunned for a short period of time, with the player who destroyed the prop always given limited invulnerability, speed boost and crit boost.

&gt;Upon Merasmus' defeat, while collecting the Skull Island Topper will award A Lovely Vacation Spot.

Wow, reach the finish line, and earn your hat. Good luck!

**Wave 666**

**Vulnerable to...**

* Pyros.  Spies continue to burn
* Jarate.  They *hate* that stuff.
* Mad Milk. They *hate* that stuff too.
* Crossfire.  Friendly crossfire will expose him as a spy.  Enemy crossfire will kill him.
* His own team.  Friendly players not reacting to you in a hostile way exposes you as a spy.
* Spies on his own team.(I explain below)
* All other enemy players

**A few words on the Spy..**

The spy is generally not recommended for new players.  The spy relies heavily on map knowledge, so it is important to know as much as you can about the game, map, your team, and the enemy team as possible.

On to the guide.

-----

**Spy Paranoia**

Spies often work best alone.  That is

*Spy Paranoia* is a condition that multiple, and fire indiscriminately at their own team to root out spies.  The more widespread this is, the harder it is for a spy to perform functions outside of merely distracting the enemy team.  

Limiting spy paranoia is important to being an effective spy.  The less the enemy expects a spy

-----

**The Other Side of the Second Line**

If you read my engineer guide

* No Escape.

No second line means that there is no where for the enemy to retreat to, it is easy to predict where the enemy will try to escape to.

* No Return.

If a player dies while there is no second line

* No Support

Without a sentry and second-line defenders (like the sniper), harder hitting classes can move in closer with less challenge.

-----

**The Approach**

In order to do anything as a spy, so **I will cover approach techniques much later in the guide, when I cover weapons and load outs.**  Here are the basics, though.

* **Avoid High Traffic Areas.**

The more bodies that are in one place, catch fire from ambushing pyros, or simply ignored by your friendly team, which will tip enemies off that you're a spy, if you're disguised as them. Solid map knowledge gives more options to the spy.

* **Avoid Crossfire** 

Crossfire can reveal your location if you are cloaked, if its the enemy team.

* **Know where the ammo and health is**

After you make it beyond the front line

* **It is preferable to not be seen

Cloaking is generally the best way to get behind the enemy's lines.  If you have the ability to

##Classes and Roles##

**Scout**

*Giant debuffin'

The scout's main roles on his team(in addition to killing) are collecting cash and debuffing enemies.  Grabbing cash provides an overheal for the scout

Going scout to collect money and ensuring bonuses will help your entire team.  If you abstain from spending money

Despite having smaller capacities than the stock scattergun, and capacity, you can deal devastating damage to large groups of enemies.  The Force a' Nature features a knock back, which is good for tossing light enemies around, displacing bomb carriers, resetting the bomb, and delaying fast-moving enemies like sentry busters and Giant Scouts.  The Soda Popper allows you to spray bullet walls of crits when your firing speed and clip capacity are high.  Both do very

Starting out against giants

Upgrade for 35% slowing movement speed and use milk against large groups of enemies, soldiers, pyros) or fast, durable enemies(Giant Scouts).   Use bonk for games with early waves of high damage spawns(eg. Huge groups of soldiers, demos, heavies) to distract enemies and collect money more safely.  Despite being healed by money-grabbing, it's still nearly impossible to survive 12+ simultaneous rockets.   Milk is your best friend over-all

**Scout Breakdown:**

- Kill high priority targets
- Get money
- Consider using the Soda Popper or the Force a' Nature for your primary.
- Start with Fan of War
- Start with Bonk

---------------------------------------

**Soldier**

*Blow them up real good.*

Consider your primary

All of the soldier's rocket launchers are powerful in their own degree

The Bazooka deals incredible burst damage, he can switch to another player, then back to you before you use your rockets again.  Communication with your team makes this weapon a wave crusher.

For the soldier on the move, the healing per hit and on kill will make it a small task to keep healthy and keep mobile.  The better you are at rocket jumping the happier you'll be with this weapon.  A faster reloading and a faster firing Black Box gives the soldier significant endurance when dealing with enemy fire.

The Direct Hit is a great balance between burst damage and control.  Focus on reload speed early on, use crit canteens to ramp damage up.  Extremely fast reload speeds make the need for a larger clip a secondary concern, but 6 shots gives a nice cushion for mistakes or a sudden need to rocket jump or change targets.

Weapons

- **Beggar's Bazooka**: *Much Burst* Prioritize: Balance Larger Clips with Reload Speed

- **The Black Box**: *Be Hard to Kill* Prioritize: 5 Shots, More than 5 Shots, Damage

- **The Direct Hit**: *Control and Power* Prioritize Faster Reload Speed, Damage, Larger Clip(More than 6 shots)

Good soldiers know how to juggle enemy players.  You can do that with robots, and you're on a map such as Decoy or Coal works where there are significant opportunities to restart or send back the bomb.  This isn't effective on giants, so save it for the little guys.

The Buff Banner is a solid choice for a secondary, explosives and(if applicable, fire.)  The Buff Banner is useful throughout the entire game, allowing a full 133% damage to enemies at any range, and great for attacking tanks.


**Soldier Breakdown:**

- Blow things up
- Pick your Rocket Launcher and stick to it.
- Juggle small robots with your rocket launcher if you don't have a pyro.

---------------------------------------

**Pyro**

*Apparently

Pyros are, you will mop up large groups of rock-em, sock-em heavies.  Other waves, you'll be keeping Giant Scouts within sentry-gun range, or collecting money from dead enemies too far away for your heavier, slower friends to get.  This also means you need to understand priorities and ammo conservation too.  Giant Scouts will almost always need your attention, or most of your team's attention.  Enemy medics, should either be killed quickly or kept away from their heal targets.  Coordinate with your engineer to decide whether he will need help with sentry busters, and steep drops to delay bomb carriers.

Also: You probably can't reflect all of those rockets/grenades. Seriously, especially when you need to stay alive to stop a Giant Scout.

If you're focusing on a tank, not the length.

**Pyro Breakdown:**

- You have about a thousand roles. Know how to prioritize them.
- Don't try to be the air blast hero on soldier/demo waves.  One errand twitch
- Use the tank as cover and burn enemies on the other side of it.

---------------------------------------

**Demo**

*Kaboom!*

Loch n' Load or Grenade Launcher?

The Loch N' Load comes with 2 fewer shots, but many people may find the LnL to be easier to aim.  If you're not comfortable with the grenade launcher, the LNL is a good substitute.  Upgrade the ammo capacity and reload speed quickly, and you'll be set.

Sticky Launcher or Scottish Resistance?

The Sticky Launcher is a safe weapon.  The Scottish Resistance has, the Sticky Launcher is a more flexible weapon, being that it can be used for direct offense (Airbursts) or as a trap.  If you have a team that you trust to handle uncertain circumstances, you will benefit more from the Scottish Resistance.  If you find yourself the main person to respond to sudden changes in the flow of the game, the stock sticky launcher will be a quicker mode of travel and damage source.  In either case, you should be using your sticky launcher to deal massive damage to incoming waves, and priority targets like Uber Medics.

To Be Demoknight or Not to be?

If you have to ask, but their role is different.  It's important to be able to aim with your grenade launcher/LNL while playing with a shield + large melee weapon, since you'll need to be able to effectively use the crits(via upgrade you earn from melee kills.  The shield, combined with upgraded resistances, can make you  tough to kill with explosives, especially if you're using the targe over the screen.  Be careful(and distant) with heavies, and upgrade your charge for quick ins-and-outs to grab money and score crits.


**Demoman Breakdown:**

- Figure out your loadout
- Deal enormous burst damage with sticky traps.
- It's safer not to be a demoknight.

**What is...**

**Medieval Mode?**

Medieval mode is a mode of gameplay that limits your weapon usage

**Melee Mode?**

Another mode


On to the guide.

-----

**The Scout Overview**

The Medieval Mode scout is incredibly hard to kill when played defensively.  Thanks to their enormous speed and double jumps


**Recommended Loadouts**

**Load out #1:**

* Secondary: Mad Milk
* Melee: Candy Cane

In Medieval Mode

**Load out #2:**

* Secondary: Mad Milk
* Melee: Sun on a Stick

If you have a pyro on your team using the sharpened volcano fragment

**Load out #3: **

* Secondary: Mad Milk
* Melee: Sandman

If you're any good with connecting sandman baseballs, to give them a chance to either escape or finish them off.

-----

**The Pyro Overview**

The pyro comes into Medieval mode as a rather hardy character.  His naturally moderate-high health allows him to soak 3 melee hits before dying.  Without his flame thrower or a Sharpened Volcano Fragment

**Recommended Loadouts**

*(Section that was previously here has been edited out.  Information included was changed/patched by Valve.  Thanks for the correction

* The Back Scratcher

Since this weapon allows you to gain more health out of health kits, again, negated.


* Sharpened Volcano Fragment

The Volcano fragment is a good menacing weapon.  Connecting the axe to a scout or a medic is a high priority

-----

**The Heavy Overview**

*It is good day to be giant man.* The heavy is a slow, the heavy cannot effectively chase down enemies without the proper load out.  Once the heavy is on a point, either defending or attacking, he is hard to get off it.

**Recommended Loadouts**

*(Section that was previously here has been edited out.  Information included was changed/patched by Valve.  Thanks for the correction

**Load out #2:**

* Secondary: Buffalo Steak Sandvich

* Melee: Killing Gloves of Boxing

This particular load out is at its best when a heavy is among numerous enemies.  If the Bufflo Steak Sandvich is eaten prior to combat, but it is offset by the fact that killing anyone with the gloves grants the heavy 5 seconds of critical hits.  Each kill during the 5 seconds of crits refreshes the duration back to 5 seconds.

The Killing Gloves of Boxing is one of the few weapons that has both predictable and random crits.  Because of this, you can also drop the sandvich to use it to heal yourself, instead of consuming it for the crits and speed bonus.

* Has 125 HP and is considered a light class.
* Moves at 100% speed
* Uses a resource called Metal. 
* Creates **Dispensers**, and steadily provide metal to engineers.
* Creates **Teleporters**
* Creates **Sentries**
* Capable of upgrading buildings to increase their effectiveness(Up to level 3).
* Capable of carrying and relocating buildings to more crucial areas
* Capable of climbing on his buildings to reach harder to access areas.
* The Wrangler(a secondary weapon) allows the engineer to bullet and rocket jump to hard to reach areas at the severe cost of health.
* Has the largest secondary weapon ammo reserve(200 reserve shots with his pistol)
* Benefits more from extensive game knowledge than from raw skill.
* Stock weapons include the Shotgun(Primary)

**Their roles in a team are...**

* Establishing and maintaining a second line for front-line combatants to retreat to.
* Repairing friendly buildings and removing enemy sappers.
* Provide teams with quick access to crucial areas.
* Locking down crucial areas or choke points.
* Protecting gear(and potentially other players) from enemy spies.

**They excel at...**

* Area control and defense
* Team support
* Short to Medium Ranged combat(Shotgun)

**Vulnerable to...**

* Snipers
* Spies
* Ubercharged enemies
* Everyone else except the medic
* Their own sentries.  Sentries can hurt their creators if they are between the sentry gun and its target.

**A few words about the Engineer... **

The engineer, nothing will prepare you better for the job as an engineer quite like experience with other classes and game/map knowledge.

On to the guide.

**Understanding the second line.**

The purpose of having a second line is having a mid-way point between respawn and the front line of combat.  The second line allows players who are severely injured from the front line to **retreat, and allows players that have just died to teleport quickly to the second line from spawn.  The engineer, along with defensive minded/loaded players(IE: Homewrecker pyro, or Brass Beast Heavy) largely make up what is known as the second line.

Without a second line of defense

To be clear, for offensive engineers.  Offensive engineers will also move their gear up to re-establish the second line each time another point is captured, and will rebuild teleporters if the spawn point moves.)

**Building and Upgrading**

As you may have noticed in the overview, roughly 100 metal a piece) and by collecting the various ammo boxes in the game.

I recommend that you go through the tutorials for the engineer in the game

I would recommend that you assign special keys to your keyboard to speed up the process of which you select which objects to build

*For games with setup:*

It is considered standard to build your teleporter entrance at the start of a game(either defense or offense), with the sentry gun going up and getting upgraded just before the game starts.  Many people will argue different orders of building up, and for the most part, they're right to some degree or another.  Some favor building and upgrading the sentry before putting the teleporter exit down, others favor upgrading the dispenser, then using it to build and upgrade everything.  *All valid.*  **The important thing is that all of your gear is up and ready before the time your team really needs it.**

-----

**Location

Location is often the key to being a successful engineer.  What I will teach you will not be ""The best places to put sentry guns in Dustbowl.""  Instead

Though, as they're quite well put together and will give you some good starter ideas on how to handle other maps.

Ask yourself these questions when you consider putting your gear somewhere:

* Is my sentry in plain sight?
* Is my sentry **not** covering enemy objectives or protecting my team?
* Can my sentry be out-ranged?
* Can my sentry be edged/peeked?
* Can my sentry be splash damaged?
* Can my sentry be ambushed?
* Can my sentry be fired on from around cover?

The more of these you answer ""Yes"" to

The truth of the game is that there will be few places where your sentry will answer 'No' to all of those questions.  The ultimate goal of placing a sentry well is forcing your enemy team to build a time-consuming uber-charge to deal with it.  All your team needs to do then is kill medics on sight

**Enemy of an Enemy is a Friend Indeed.**

Don't be afraid to talk to your team about your sentry's weaknesses.  If you and other people understand where your team is weak

Lets go back over those questions

1310005674.0,iinpo,A few tips on sniping for noobies,insomniavision,32,3,24,"So, but I know a lot of you genuinely want to become decent at it.  Since there's already a few guides to spies (and because I'm not much good at them anyways)


*1)Does the team need a sniper?*

Snipers are most useful on defense.  If there's already two snipers on your team...another one is probably not going to help.  But, very useful.  As for offense, snipers are less useful...but not useless.  You should probably be bringing up the rear, picking off threats up ahead before your team reaches them.  This can be especially useful for taking out sentry nests by capping off the engineer from afar and taking out the sentries before they can be repaired.  Also, you shouldn't be anywhere near another sniper.  Two of you on the same platform is just plain redundant, when one of you could be covering another area.

*2) Long-range tactics*

Still, make sure you're in sight of the target.  You should be as far away from the action as possible while still being able to cover a broad range.  Next, learn to prioritize.  If you've got multiple enemies in sight, figure out which ones are going to cause the most trouble for your teammates to take down.  If a heavy is by the cart/cp, take him out with a headshot before he sees you.  BUT, if that heavy is being tailed by a medic, kill the medic first.  Also, help them out.  Your job is to support your teammates

*3)On your feet*

Snipers are very weak, even if your team is making an offensive push.  Still, there are few places a sniper can get to that your enemies cannot, so be prepared to switch to melee at any moment.  You should already have it turned on, but go into the advanced options and turn on ""fast weapon switching"".  Only zoom in if you have a target and you're trying to line up a shot.   Otherwise you'll need your peripheral vision to see an enemy approaching you.  If one does, immediately switch to your melee weapon.  Skip over the SMG, it's pretty much useless.  Don't try to run, and you *might* kill them before they kill you.

*4) Damn spies...*

As a sniper, and spend a decent amount of time with no peripheral vision.  Keep your back to the wall at all times so you can't be backstabbed.  If you see an ally coming even slightly too close to you, be suspicious.  Get out your melee weapon and watch them until they go away.  Shoot them if they stick around too long.  And most of all, listen for the spy's decloaking sound.

*5) Damn snipers...*

Snipers love to pick off other snipers.  When you first arrive at a new vantage point

*6) Communicate*

This goes from pretty much everyone, that sort of thing.  Press 'u' to enter team chat, and let your pals know what's up ahead.  If you see a spy disguise himself and start toward your team or their defenses, let them know (after you've tried to kill him, of course).

Well, please ask.  I'd love to help.  There's a lot of snipers out there right now, and the more they know, the better all our games will be.

Also, so if anyone wants to add something or call me on my bullshit, feel free to do that too.

1309122551.0,i9rwz,Credit to Team! - Tips from a veteran medic,,34,4,15,"I've been a medic player since 2008, it can turn the tide for a team within a round. We medics usually top the score charts, the most rewarding part

But the path of the medic involves a lot of dying, deaf and mute slab of meat, a lot of teamwork between medics themselves, and a lot of teammates yelling at you for not healing. But after the medic experience, you'll also be a bit better at scouting, heavy-ing and pyroing, since these are the classes that involves positioning, damage-avoiding, plus you get to learn the game through the eyes of a team-player



**Dying and survival:**

* You're a very important asset to the team. EVERYONE on the other team will want to try and kill you. Every bit of your tiny, in addition to the ubermeter you've lost. DO NOT DIE.

* You're important, and push him the fuck off that teleporter. He can run to the front lines before the TP even recharges, scouts DON'T need to use the teleporter.

* At the first sign of an enemy kritz shitstorm, and the demoman won't care how much you whine. Also, try reporting it over your mic or voice commands once you feel safe enough to be able to concentrate on doing that.

**When you heal:**

* If you're not using the mic, X+1 = ""Incoming!"" and the X+2 = ""Spy!"". Look out for your buddy when he's too distracted to pay attention to his soft, virgin backbone. Randomly turn around every once in a while and try to bump into teammates if they're close. When you feel a spy, STOP HEALING and pull out your ubersaw to stab the shit out of that frenchman. Your patient will notice something is wrong, and you'll have a chance to block the spy's path to your heavy's delicious back.

* You can get a charged uber up in around 40 seconds and a charged kritz or quick-fix up in around 30 seconds. Healing injured teammates will charge your gun much faster than healing teammates with full health. So have your demoman or soldier injure themselves can help build an uber fast. Healing teammates also healed by another medic or a dispenser will also lower your uber charge rate. Healing teammates that have been injured for a while (and taken no damage after) will be very fast, your uber will charge slower, so choose wisely.

* If you're with a good, thinking you're healing only one person. Once your patient is healed, try healing other people. Very often you'll have a wave of teammates running back on red health, on fire, etc. Heal people on fire first. Try to heal them all at once, so that everyone will be at 50%, then 75%, etc. spread your healing powers so people don't get discouraged. This way you also charge your uber faster

* If you're on a team without a lot of medics, and sometimes having another medic, even for a little bit, can go a long way.

* If you have a suicidal patient who thinks he can take on all the enemies with his baby fists

**Other medics:**

* Heal other medics before patients. A medic is not consider healed unless he's overhealed to his 225 health. That means if you're lucky enough to not be the only medic, so unless you're ubering someone, heal other hurt medics.

* When another medic starts his kritzkrig, at least save the medic. When people are kritz'ed they're both very powerful and vulnerable, since the entire enemy team will focus on them, so heal them. The medic is especially targeted, as well, so follow kritz if it's safe to, and help heal. The pair will thank you for it. Also try to get your team to push out with other ubers as well as your own ubers. While the uber can absorb the sentry damage, making an ""uber push"" especially effective.

**When you're charged: &gt;:D**

* When you actually get your Ubercharge up

* If you're ubered and trying to take out a sentry with your heavy or demoman buddy, damage per bullet also drops with distance. Run up to the sentry gun with your body to block his recoil so he can move forward. This could mean the difference between triumphantly taking down a lvl3 sentry gun and a sentry in your killcam.

* There's enough time at the beginning of payload round to charge your uber before gates open. Usually what most foolish medics will do (actually if you're not careful, but in my opinion a waste of red's uber. It's very easy for people to respawn at their spawn, and for engies to rebuild their crap at spawn. The ideal red uber is when blu all pushes out at once, or if they have a sentry set up, etc. Save your uber or kritz till the best time, don't use it in the beginning. And be careful of kritz-demo or uber-pyro at the beginning of a round when you're BLU.

* When you're ubered, don't jump into sentries, and by jump I mean literally jump. If you're in mid air, recoil is x1000. Try staying ahead of or even inside your uber target, so that if you get blasted away, at least he'll know. A very dangerous situation occurs when you two get separated.

**Battle medic:**

* Battle medic-ing is for when your team is at a comfortable enough position for you to battle-medic. This means that you have sentries and dispensers set up to fall back on, you have more than just one medic, and you're really not doing much by healing people. OR, if none of these suffice, if your team is super-incompetent, and you feel you can do a better job yourself (one of those rounds you know you're going to lose).

* Battle medic-ing usually involves using the blautsauger and ubersaw. Other people prefer other items, can allow you to ninja on an opponent before they're fully aware of what's going on. Using the ubersaw is common because it builds ubers quickly. When you're battle medic-ing it's very much like playing spy. You're trying to distract the opposing team by attacking them when they're focused on something else. Medics should never take on someone face-on unless they're a spy, sniper, or a scout in a narrow space. Always go behind people and try to sneak attack. I have seen quite a few medics fighting on the front lines, but IMO they're much less effective than sneaky BMs.

* You run very quickly

1317954407.0,l3pgd,Heavy Guide.,Whellopeople,29,1,24,"Like the Pyro guide

Loadouts:
Offensive Heavy
-Sasha for medium damage, it won't slow you down like the Brass Beast or take forever to start shooting like Natascha.
-Sandvich for emergency healing for both yourself and your medic. I find the shotgun useless as anything Sasha cannot take down will not be taken down by such a little weapon. Use the shotgun if you get into a lot of retreating situations where you need to put some covering fire while you run away. Otherwise, while tasty, isn't much help unless you just want to kamikize blindly-which won't net you many kills.
-Any except maybe Warrior's Spirit due to health loss. The main differences are how many times you get into melee situations. Use GRU if you find many breaks in the battle to charge an uber for the Medic. (Make sure he realizes this though.) Fists of Steel are also good if you need to run away a lot but run with your back to them so they can't see your gun-shield.

Tips: Ambush

Defensive Heavy
-Natascha. As a defensive heavy your goal should be to keep them off the cart/point/intelligence/sandvich, or any other class for that matter. Use Sasha, though, if everyone's murdering you-you're no use dead, after all!
-Sandvich-Again
-Fists because at that range you want to take the attacker down quickly.

Tips: Focus on Scouts

-

General Tips: Sandvich is usually the best secondary you can get. Emergency HP for your medic, while shotgun has a tendency to miss unless you're spot on because it's fired in a box effect. If you aim for the arm, you'll do 3-10 damage, so sandvich is better without insane accuracy.
-Use any advantage you can get. Hide behind the payload cart to dodge bullets or hide, fear is good, killing is good.
-Stay calm. Unlike maybe Pyro, shooting randomly in fear won't net you anything but death. The minigun is inaccurate so you need precise aiming.
-Check your back! Don't get Tunnel Vision. Check at the end of your uber. Check in corridors. Check your back everywhere-you're slow
-Pay attention to the medic tooltip. If it disconnects or if he starts taking damage
-The Medic's life IS more important than yours. If the enemy is pushing in and your medic has ran away by use of a hallway


-

VS Class
Scout - Be careful with this one. He's your polar opposite and one of the three-four banes of your existence. Focus on him before anything

Soldier - Not too hard unless you're far away. Keep in medium range, so you'll likely come on top especially if you stay calm and keep your accuracy.

Pyro - Keep at medium-long range. If he has an axtinguisher he'll be very deadly at close range and cannot dish out damage out of close range. Also another reason to check your back

Demoman - We have a problem here. You're too slow to dodge his stickies and he has the highest damage output in the game. However, so try zig-zagging. Also, the closer the better if you zig-zag, highest damage output and medium hitpoints means he might just kill himself!

Heavy - Really, crits, who fired first,which minigun you both have, team awareness (Heavy is a team player), Cover (if I've got 50% cover I'm going to kill a Heavy who spins up before me unless we're at point blank. There's a couple of spots where one can fire from 75% cover, from there I'll go head to head with a heavy/medic combo and win,Pre-fight sandvich throwdown 450 health &gt; 300 health.

Engineer - Probably the least dangerous class you can encounter, medium damage output versus lowest speed, highest hitpoints, and one of the highest damage outputs as well as attack speed.

Engineer's Sentry - You may think you're tough enough to take on a level three sentry. Surprisingly, you might have to search for another route or switch classes. Depending on your skill/luck/skill of enemy engineer, this can be the third bane of your existence.

Medic - Like Engineer

Battle Medic - I have problems with their Blutsauger. Stay calm and try to keep your crosshair on them at a medium range and you'll probably get them.

Medic's Patient - If they haven't seen you, you might have just turned the tide of the entire game. If they have seen you, run away or get behind them.

Uber/Kritz Patient - Run away. You can't do anything to them. Or, run away.

Sniper - If he has the Huntsman, he hits your legs or maybe even misses. If you crouch, he might accidentally hit you in the head. Usually, he's at a really long range. You cannot stop him at long range, so it's best to jump and run unpredictably across the battlefield until you're safe.

Spy - The final bane of your existence, and revving up simultaneously. If you can catch him, you will beat him.

1309799388.0,igi35,3 Tips for New Players (xpost from tf2),strengths,35,11,22,"I'm not sure how many actually new players will see this


***1)  Play the right classes for your team.***


This is by far the most important advice I can give.

Here are the classes in order of credit to team:

1. Medic

2. Soldier

3. Heavy, Pyro

5. Spy

Pick your class based on this

* If your team does not have a medic
* Your team never needs more than 2 spies (1 good spy).
* Your team never needs more than 2 snipers (1 good sniper).
* Your team never needs more than 2 engies on offense

The way these classes (sniper, but that doesn't happen that often.


***2) Use the right weapons.***


When in doubt


**Scout**: All stock; Bonk situationally

**Soldier**: Stock + Equalizer; Buff Banner when playing on a big server

**Pyro**: Backburner

**Demo**: All stock; Ullapool Caber/other melee if like

**Heavy**: Minigun

**Engineer**: Depends on your style

**Medic**: Syringe Gun (you need the health)

**Sniper**: Rifle + DDS/Jarate

**Spy**: Stock

That's the short story when it comes to items. A lot of this is based on my preference


***3) Do your job.***


Each class has a certain role that if they aren't fulfilling


**Scout**: Your job is to flank the enemy. This means attack them from the sides and from behind. You must utilize your greatest asset: speed. Do this by moving constantly and unpredictably. Your targets: medics


**Soldier**: Your job is to deal a lot of damage


**Pyro**: Your job is to ambush enemies. Use corners to your advantage. Sneak up behind enemies

**Demo**: Your job is to protect choke points and in general just kill. Demomen are one of the best classes for dealing damage and cannot be beat for defending. Locate high traffic areas on the map and place your stickies there. Hold down M1 with the sticky launcher to launch stickies further. When in doubt

**Heavy**: Your job is to tank and to deal the most damage. Heavies are great at attacking crowds

**Engineer**: If you are defending, not just you; build it as close to the front line as possible. Don't be afraid to use your shotgun and pistol to deal extra damage to the enemy.

**Medic**: You are by far the most important class. Your job is to stay alive. Heal teammates and use your ubers to push forward. The worst thing you can do as a medic is die

**Sniper**: You are the least important

**Spy**: This is by far the hardest class to play. My advice is similar for the sniper: don't play this class if your team is losing. Take out the enemy teleporters, then quickly sap his sentry. Remember that your watch makes a sound when you uncloak so try to uncloak a good distance away. This class is useless if the enemy team has several pyros or if your team has more than one other spy.

**All classes**: 


* **LOOK OUT FOR SPIES.** Seriously this is the easiest way to kill a noob. If you see someone act weird

* Never stand still. If you've played TF2 for any amount of time, backstabbed, shot, or blown up.


* Teleporters are extremely important. Help the engie by upgrading his teles before the round starts or whenever you can (it only takes a second to switch to engie


* Stand on the point. If you are defending, stand on the point. If you are attacking, even if you think you will die, if your team is pushing hard, stand on the point.

1312995797.0,jeqwp,Having trouble with engineers as a spy? Look no further.,bamfusername,30,4,26,"Many new spies seem to face enormous difficulty when it comes to taking down a sentry. It's quite a challenge and it's very easy for the entire process to go wrong. *One errant twitch...*

The process of taking down an engineer and his nest can be divided into three stages

* The Approach
* The Attack
* The Escape

**The Approach**

Every spy knows just how difficult it is to get close to a sentry. Let's face it - engineers are a paranoid bunch and so are their team of dedicated spycheckers. And every single one is perfectly willing to show you just how much they love you with the business end of their weapons.

The approach is all about getting into the ideal position to strike and do to that

First of all, I tend to disguise as an engineer with a wrench out, since they're expected to be constantly wrenching their sentries. 

Second

Avoid looking directly at the sentry or engineer while you approach it. Keep your crosshair focused on your team. Remember

Third, do it! Keep the element of surprise on your side.

**The attack**

When should you attack? The ideal time would be when the engineer is distracted by your team. Be patient - waiting a few seconds for your team to move against the engineer can completely alter the results of your attack.

Now

* Sap and Sap

Technique:
Constantly reapply sappers on ALL of the buildings near you. This is a battle of attrition which the engineer will lose if he doesn't try to kill you

Advantages:

You can keep your disguise - losing your disguise is an instant giveaway. This gives you a few seconds of hesitation on the part of your enemies before they start to move in on you.

It's idiot-proof(ish) - no fancy tricks involved. Just press 2 and spam M1 until everything goes down. It's hard to screw this up.

Disadvantages:

The engineer stays alive. And he's going to be **angry**. A smart engineer will try and shotgun you before unsapping his stuff

It's slow - it's a battle of attrition. Anyone who looks at you doing this will probably just start spamming at the sentry nest to kill you.

You can counteract this by juking and jumping on the engineers buildings to throw him off.

When to Sap and Sap: 

When you're faced with multiple

When your team is going to back you up. In this case

* Stab and sap

Technique:

(You'll need fast weapon switch enabled)
Stab the engineer

Advantages:

The engineer dies. He won't be able to kill you or unsap his stuff.

It's fast. The entire move occurs in under a second.

Disadvantages:

Easy to screw up. You will not believe how easy it is to stab the sentry and sap the engineer. Also failstabs

You lose your disguise. You'll need to get away VERY quickly after sapping everything.

When to use:

This is a pretty effective move and can be applied on most engineers. However

* Sap and Stab

Technique:

It's like stab and sap

Advantages:

Sapping first might make things easier - you don't need to worry as much about the sentry.

Disadvantages:

An alert engineer will probably just kill you before unsapping his sentry.

You lose the element of surprise.

When to use:

When the engineer is AWAY from his buildings. Sap his buildings

* Sap and shoot

Technique:

Sap the sentry

Advantages:

Depending on the situation

Disadvantages:

If you can't aim

When to use:

Wrench-lovin' engineers on the other team.

Alert jerk on the other team who won't turn expose his juicy back for a stab.

When the sentry and engineer are near

* Abusing dispensers

Most people don't realize two things about dispensers

1. Your sentry can't shoot through your own dispenser

2. The dispenser hitbox is fricking enormous.

This means that the dispenser is a fantastic shield. You can stand behind the dispenser and unload your revolver on the engineer and the sentry without taking any damage.

Alternatively, but the engineer will be killed (You can be killed by your own sentry) and you'll be completely safe.

Advantages:

Less risky than sap and shoot

Disadvantages:

You'll be forced to stay in one spot

Situational - you won't always be able to take advantage of it. 

When to use:

When sap and shoot doesn't seem viable (engineer has good aim



* Abusing teleporters or: How I learned to telefrag like a boss.

Technique:

Sap the teleporter entrance and stand on it. Wait for the engineer to unsap it. If he's an idiot

Advantages:

You keep your disguise

You kill the engineer

Unexpected

Disadvantages:

Depends on the engineer being an idiot and standing on the teleporter exit to unsap.

Relatively well known spy trick - it's not as unexpected as you think.

When to use:

When you've successfully infiltrated the enemy base

When you're up against newish players



**The Escape**

Hopefully, to make your great escape. And you don't have a motorbike to ride off into the sunset.

Honestly, knowing that you've just crushed the hopes and dreams of yet another engineer.

Ok, here's a little guide to get you started.

Currency in the TF2 economy is mostly metal. Metal comes in three varieties: Scrap

**Scrap metal** is the lowest form of metal

**Reclaimed Metal** is a medium form of metal. This is made by **combining three scrap metal**. Reclaimed metal is used to purchase some low-end stranges

**Refined metal** is the highest form of metal

Prices are abbreviated as their value in refined metal. 1.11, because a scrap metal is 11 percent of a refined metal. 

If we're going higher than that, and even for metal. Once again, as a general rule, **1 key = ~3 ref**, give or take. Keys are used to purchase very high end hats and strange weapons, for example a Strange Kritzkrieg is anywhere from 37 to 39 keys, because it could only be found in an incredibly rare crate

Going even *higher*, more if painted certain colours, and are used in the purchase of low-end unusuals.

Now we're in unusual territory. The **Earbud** was a promotional item given to anybody who played TF2 on a mac within the first week or so of its release on that platform, earbuds are the primary currency. 

Beyond that

So, everybody's got a favourite class, right? You probably want a hat for that class that's on fire. Everybody likes fire. Well, in order to get that, you need an Unusual. Unusual hats are hats with special effects, such as flies, orbiting planets, sometimes as much as $500. 

Unusuals come from crates

As far as tips and tricks go, and sell them at as high a price as people will pay. Once you start to build up a collection of weapons you either already have or don't want, sell them off for a small profit in metal. 

The #1 rule of trading is to always

2. **An enemy is never just *running*.  He is always running *somewhere*.**  Towards the cart, but he almost always has a final destination in mind.  Use this to predict his movement patterns and fire your rockets accordingly.  At short range, you are better off firing at him directly, but at long range, your rockets will be too slow if you don't lead your target.

By changing your field of view you can see more of the battlefield at once.  The default Field of view is 75

Furthermore, but gives you a wider view of your character model, the result being that your weapon takes up less of the screen (the exception being the heavy).  I prefer 75, the command is:

Heavy is alright.  Usually I get a pocket medic and I just try and get close and personal.  I do alright with heavies.

Demoman?  I completely suck at.  The only good I do as a Demoman is put my sticky bombs near the cart/entrance, but I rarely ever hit anything.

Medic I'm alright at.  Easy enough. Stay hidden while healing Heavy/Soldier/Demo.  I usually find the highest rated player on my team and pocket heal him.  

Pyro?  I'm dead before I even start firing.

Scout?  Surprisingly I am alright at Scout.

1275789016.0,cbw6t,Managing Paranoia: A guide to Spy psychology and outwitting your opponents,rocketbears,25,1,3,"*This is intended for those who have just started Spy
___________________________________

A lot of people would say that the Spy's biggest counter is the Pyro. That is only true up to a certain point. The truth is the biggest counter to the Spy is **Paranoia**.

Why? Because the Spy's biggest weapon is stealth. Any class that is paranoid enough can counter the Spy just as well as the Pyro can.

But then the reverse is also true. Any Spy that is stealthy enough can counter any Pyro

Knowing that

Paranoia is simply when other players are afraid of getting backstabbed by you. What drives paranoia is a mixture of both survival instinct and childish fear. Symptoms of paranoia include the following:

     *Shouting ""Spy!"" in voice commands  
     *Spychecking teammates excessively 
     *Turning around
     *Walking in zigzags trying to bump into a spy 
     *Randomly firing or swinging at the air 
     *Firing at friendly dispensers 
     *Walking backwards to see if anyone's following 
     *More pyros than there were before.

This list starts from the least worst going down to the worst forms of paranoia. Just as the Spy's main weapons are Cloak, Ability to see enemy health and Evasion, the above list is the many weapons that players will use against you, whether they know it or not, to fight your stealth. Know them well and be familiar with them.



No matter what game mode you are in, the more paranoia there will be, which will then increase the symptoms of paranoia, not just in number, but in harshness. That is why one of the important decisions of picking the Spy class in a game is whether or not you want to do your spying in an extremely paranoid environment. 

_____________________________________________________

&gt;Every class has a counter

As stated

Other teammates. Your team mates effectively counter paranoia. (There is one exception to this

Too many spies die trying to stab heavy-medic combos because they make the mistake of trying to stab them while they aren't shooting anyone
Another popular one is a sentry that just will not go down because the engineer is on the lookout for you constantly.

The mistake with these two scenarios is that the Spy has been effectively countered by the enemy paranoia. To counter the paranoia

Beware of friendly scouts. They are your 2nd worst enemies after paranoid Pyros. You're probably thinking it's weird that a team mate can be an enemy. But guess what?

Friendly scouts attract an insane amount of attention. They also can cover a lot of space in a short space of time

Combine this altogether and what you get is a big, you can bet on your death in the next 10 seconds. Stay away from friendly scouts as if they were enemy Pyros. 

_____________________________________

We established paranoia was an element of fear. The fear element exists because people are afraid of what they can't see. So

Let's have a few examples:
*On CTF maps

*I would disguise as a friendly soldier or demoman before approaching a sentry. If you've played engineer

The idea is simply this, stab them or use that as your opportunity to sink further into the base.  Focus the paranoia on a particular fixed area - then use your cloak to slip by the area of paranoia you've just created. 
_______________________________________

Sometimes the best way to counter paranoia is to avoid it and create it somewhere else. All enemies have a ""zone"" of paranoia which they project. Paranoid engineers will be paranoid anywhere around their sentry. Paranoid pyro's will often have their zone as the entry to their base

The point i'm making is that paranoia is restricted to a space. If people are looking for you in that space, stabbing snipers at the back of the map) then that space will become ""hot"" in the sense that people will constantly be looking for you there.

Have any of you played the Metal Gear Solid series? Well if you haven't, people will stop caring. That is when you attack again.

Occasionally you will find that you've created so much chaos that people will actively run around and look for you. If this happens, just be creative. 

_________________________________________

If you want to make your time with the Spy the most enjoyable, support your team indirectly then attack at the right place at the right time. It's no different to Ubercharge. An Ubercharge only succeeds if it's used on the right person, at the right time, in the right situation. This is why i insist that the Spy is a support class and not an offensive class because his style is very similar to the medic.

People who play the Spy offensively i.e, if you backstab people, they'll just respawn. If you keep backstabbing them, they'll learn to expect you. Some will turn Pyro just to burn you.

TF2 is an objective orientated team-based game, they'll just respawn and try again (especially if they're on BLU). Unless you backstab for a good reason in a good place, then you aren't doing your team any favours. In Arena, if you always run in for a backstab, the opponents will learn to expect you and create paranoia that kills you quicker.

Conclusion:
Paranoia is the biggest weapon versus spies
The Spy is a support class

If you've ever played a King of the Hill match
http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/thumb/b/b9/Engineer_Update_MiniSentries.png/800px-Engineer_Update_MiniSentries.png)

The Combat Mini Sentry Gun (commonly known as a mini sentry) is a special sentry gun that replaces the Engineer's standard Sentry when wielding the Gunslinger instead of a wrench. It cannot be upgraded or repaired, fires twice as fast as a level 1 sentry, and costs only 100 metal. In addition, the engineer that placed it has an extra 25 health. 

The mini-sentry is particularly effective in King of The Hill because it is a reliable source of quick damage that doesn't require the commitment of a regular sentry. Engineers often take advantage of a KotH map's smaller size

This of course

While this may or may not be true

* Avoid the sentry. This is blatantly obvious
* Heckle the engineer. If you see the engie, you'll outlast him and he'll switch to another class just to stop you from killing him so much. 
* Go Medic. Mini sentry? I'm sorry
*  Speaking of, demomen, and soldiers are already effective at taking out engineer buildings, it's just a smaller, more fragile target with the mini sentry. be careful though because you'll likely be taking fire from the gun, the engie, and 3 other classes in that cramped KotH map while you do it. 
* Scouts and spies beware, so the mini sentry kind of puts them in their place with a side effect of shooting everone else :p)

Be warned

- If you're being healed by a medic and he stops healing you, which will be much easier if you're their to help. I can't repeat that enough.

-If approaching a medic looking for a heal, getting you back to the fight quicker (YER spys, switch to your sapper from current weapon, as the disguised spy cannot do this)

- Don't use the blutz. It cuts your health down to +1/sec rather than +3. Yes, 90% of the time your ally just died, meaning there is a few enemies, and they are all gunning for you). Overdose is ok, the speed boost is nice, crossbow is fine provided you have the amputator for the +4 boost. Personally I like the overdose. That +speed boost when I'm at 90% uber and have to retreat is a godsend. Either use that or the stock needlegun. You aren't here to kill anything more than the odd scout/pyro/spy that sneaks up on you, and even them, in which case you'll probably rage quit and go demopan or spycrab)

-If you pop an uber to engage a sentry nest, though be wary of airblasting pyros. If in doubt, retreat.

-If you are under heavy fire

-If the medic pops uber on you to take down a nest

-If playing medic, the god damn engi. yes, some classes take priority, but if you have a free second, make sure everyone is topped up. If you're under fire, pocket the right player for the location until you can get to health, then heal up the team.

-Only run the quick fix if there is at least one other good medic. If I'm being honest

-it's ok to retreat and let whoever you're healing die. If a pyro decides to charge a sentry nest at medium range while you have 20% uber

-If you're getting healed with a medic

-Don't ask medics to pocket you. We are here to support the entire team

- heal those at lower health before those at higher. That should be obvious.

-if you see another medic about to go down, it'll mean a quicker victory for your team.

-If you are going to a medipack and see a medic, or through me to the pack (scouts I'm looking at you) is ridiculous. My class has a giant heal gun. Let me use it.

-Move move move move move. Always crouch jump, if you can dodge a wrench you can dodge gruesome death.

-Medic is target #1 for all classes. Remember this, and above all stay with your team. If a pyro's going behind an enemy to backburner, that's their choice, but unless you have a full uber that can steamroll them, stick with your team, you're more use alive.

-If you're about to uber a soldier, but they have a long ass reload time. Same goes for pipe launcher demos, although really they should be using stickies to wipe a sentry nest.

-Always let the medic get on the teleporter before you, slap it on you and push to victory.

-Watch where the Ubered medic is coming from, be wary of your surroundings, as it's running out. -heavies, if a retreating medic is seperated from his ubered ally, switch to your GRU and get forward to use up the last bit of uber with your minigun, rather than pondorusly moving about with the brass beast. May as well get some kills in, but don't try to take on a nest, and you will die.-

-If suspicious of an ally running towards you, but be careful, sidestabs can occur.

-totally ignore K/D. You're a medic. This should be obvious. Oh

- Know when to use your uber/kritz. Against one enemy? nope.jpeg. Against a sentry nest and a couple of guards? Uber that shit up!

Remember, and you are a team player. Stick with your allies, buff them up, save them, dominate the leaderboard, and then come to me, I'll give you a little medal.

1311061013.0,itmnx,Why the Backburner isn't worth your time.,HereticalSteampunk,30,7,27,"I was witness to a mass trading orgy of 3+ new players trying to find backburners earlier today. While I had a desire to explain to them why it isn't the best thing since sliced bread

Proponents of the backburner will cite it's increased damage and guaranteed rear critical as the reason to use it. Indeed

This brings us to my first point. Airblasting allows a pyro to be credit to team. Not only can you protect sentry nests and defend yourself at range, the Backburner can perform 4 at 50 ammo each. That's a great deal of utility lost. Pyro v. Soldier becomes a game of 'run away' and no longer can you embarrass snipers by covering them in their own piss without depleting a quarter of your own ammo.

Now that we've covered the downside, apply to afterburn, which means you gain very little if you're running in and out, forcing the team to run back to medics/medpacks and playing good D (certainly not enough to justify the loss of 8 airblasts imo). It's nice in pyro v. pyro, but only if you can ensure that your opposition isn't 10% more accurate than you are.

Now let's talk about the rear critical. Back when it was first released you could crit a target as long as you started shooting while he was facing away, in addition to +50 health made the weapon OP as Kalashnikovs in the Civil War. That's changed. Now one only crits within a roughly 90 degree angle at the targets back (unlike the 180 degree backstab hemisphere.) This encourages ambushing/flanking, as backburner crits will finish off any class in seconds. That sounds great until you remind yourself you're sacrificing survivability and team support to achieve it. Furthermore, the degreaser can also pull this off equally well in the form of the sting pyro.

The Degreaser allows you to switch weapons 65% faster (which is nearly instant in-game) at the cost of -25% afterburn damage (4 dmg per tick, one second of damage will net about 105 damage. Add in a second of burn, 4 damage, and a quickswitch axtinguisher hit, 195 damage nets 304 damage, enough to one-shot a heavy.

To be fair, and can still puff out 9 more airblasts to assist in the pyro's escape without going to get ammo.

In addition to the excellent combo with the axtinguisher, that's enough to one-shot a medic (forcing him to retreat to a health pack, slowing the enemy advance)

After all is considered

I assume that ""pocket medic"" refers to the focusing of healing on only one or two players instead of the whole team. The reason I chose to focus on my heavies was because they were racking up kills, but if I decide to stop healing a heavy in the middle of a battle because my soldier is low health, won't my heavy be at risk of dying? I consider a heavy more valuable than a soldier in an open-area battle. Or if heavy does survive but take a lot of damage, and soldier thinks he's going to die, they will both run for cover thinking I won't heal them and the enemy can advance while I derp in the middle of the field.

2. Use your axetinguisher on scouts. Blast them against something
 
3. One thing I NEVER see pyros do that drives me crazy is reflecting sentry rockets. First of all, you have a VERY good chance of one shotting someone if you hit them with the reflection. Those rockets hit hard as hell, and even harder when reflected. The timing is very easy to develop, just remember it and keep at it!

4. You can have a record for headshots as pyro! Huntsman arrows. Yeah.

* You always have top priority for teleporters. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

* Do not build your 'nest' so you stand on the teleporter. A Spy will head to spawn

* **MOUSE2 WILL ROTATE THE TELEPORTER EXIT**, not to mention dangerous.

* Know if your [spawn](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Respawn_area) moves up. If so


[**DISPENSERS**](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Dispenser)

* A Level 3 dispenser heals at the same rate as a Medic.

* Dispensers

* Dispensers near the front lines are invaluable to teammates

[**SENTRIES**](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Sentry)

* Sentries can turn 360 degrees. Don't feel compelled to put them in corners; this makes it easier for splash damage weapons to hit them.

* Lower level sentries are quieter than higher ones.

* **DO NOT PUT SENTRIES NEXT TO EACHOTHER**. This provides little to no benefit and makes it all the more easier for a Spy or ubered Demoman to come in and destroy them in one fell detonation.

* Sentries provide a slightly higher boost than dispensers.

**DEALING WITH PRACTICAL PROBLEMS**

*Q: In what order should I place my equipment?*

A: It depends on 3 major factors: Numbers

If you're on a team of 12 with nearby metal and you're near the front lines, put down the teleporter, get it to level 2, put down the dispenser and finish upgrading everything. Alternatively, put the sentry down last if you can convince your team guard you as you set up.

In general, the less you need a sentry and the more you need a dispenser. The closer you get to the front lines, the more necessary a sentry becomes, and a teleporter.

*Q: I want to go engineer

A: If you're an offensive engineer, which, if done successfully, will allow your team to move up. Becoming a 'Ninja-Engie' is essentially sneaking sentries and teleporters in places where the enemy rarely expects them. Choosing to do either often results in many rebuildings, although as a 'Ninja-Engie', you leave sentries and forget about them. Keeping the sentries at level 1, while shortening their life, DO NOT PUT IT IN THE SAME PLACE. The enemy will be expecting this. The entire point of going 'Ninja-Engie' is to surprise them.

*Q: It's the beginning of the round

A: **HELP THEM OUT**. One level 3 sentry does 225 damage per second. A level 1 does 64. A level 3 does **3.5 TIMES** the damage per second a level 1 sentry does. Therefore

*Q: In general

A: You want to make sure that your other buildings cannot be attacked without them being in range of the sentry. Past that,False,,t5_2rbtk,True,,,t3_as387

In this thread

Sound propagates in waves. Similarly

The effect of this is quite simple. If you are running BACKWARDS as a pyro

If you are running FORWARD

**So what does this mean for you, make sure you are backpedaling. This will make your flame longer and his flame shorter. Once you have practiced pyro a lot, you will get to the point where you can consistently burn an enemy pyro while his flame either doesn't touch you or is barely licking you. Based on how many particles a flame has moved, the damage changes. Even if they ARE hitting you, your particles will have flown a short distance and will be doing more damage.

*Circle Strafing*
If you are at a health disadvantage to an enemy pyro then once you start back pedaling you should quickly strafe right or left while turning your aim the opposite direction. Due to how particles work

A properly executed circle strafe involves a little bit of forward running too, it is just very natural.

**Pyro vs Pyro Technique #3**
*shotgun keepaway*
This is pretty self explanatory. The ideal set up here is the Degreaser and Shotgun. Basically, you quick switch, puff them away, and continue with your shotgun. This is likely the easiest and safest method for defeating an enemy pyro but it is BY FAR the slowest (unless you land 2 really meaty shots). If you run out of shells but have dealt significant damage then go ahead and burn him out. 

**GENERAL TIPS AND TRICKS**

* If you want to train to be an amazing mid range pyro

* the Q key on your keyboard will always switch to your last active gun. If you like to axtinguish people

* The flare gun reloads itself even if you don't have it out. Get into the habit of immediately putting away your flare gun when you shoot it. Having your flamethrower at the ready could safe you from a soldier rocket or any number of things.

* The flares will automatically crit a burning target for 90 damage at any range. Once you are a boss with the flare gun

* The backburner does more base damage than the other flamethrowers. Its air blast costs more and seems bugged right now. It reflects projectiles just fine but sometimes when enemies are on slopes it will just simply not move them. I am not the only person that has noticed either.

**Recommended Loadouts**

* *All around powerful*

Degreaser

Shotgun

Axtinguisher

Gives you access to the fast kills of the axtinguisher, setting up axe combos and disabling fast targets with airblast for easy shotgunning.

*  *Flamethrower as primary weapon*

Backburner

Flaregun

Rake

You don't need the axtinguisher as much here so might as well carry the rake so you can roam alone. You will ambush people with this class. When you aren't sneaking around

* *Just don't*

Standard Flamethrower

Detonator

Volcanic Shard

Standard flamethrower is almost entirely inferior to the degreaser. It does 50 afterburn damage instead of 38. THAT'S. IT. Detonator is gimped as hell. Can't auto crit

Basic options- I look for servers with ping &lt; 100, no password, and a limit of 24 players per server. Feel free to adjust the player limit to your personal taste.

Server tags- If you're new to the game, especially if they're soliciting donations. A lot of them will give cheaty perks to people who give them money. Check to see if a server is spoofing its player count by right clicking and viewing the server information. If it's showing 23/24 on the browser but not in the server information, you can safely blacklist it.

In my humble opinion

Let's start with the backburner: Airblasting will be severely limited
But the main purpose of airblasting - reflecting rockets - never seemed very appealing to me. It's not that hard to dodge rockets with a 100 percent speed class

So, so any back-pedaling enemy will be able to avoid it.

It's much more about height advantage
Sure, homewrecker). 
Last point: Backburner gives you an edge over other pyros, Shotgun in the face.
_______________________________

Number two, waiting for a perfect opportunity that will never come. 

I top scored in a recent match without even trying to be careful. As long as you're avoiding Pyros

Don't waste your cloak by running around invisible, I was literally just standing there (at a wall right next to the gates) and picked some easy targets. Got caught only once when I made the mistake to run for a health pack and got revealed by stray bullets.

But the fun part began later, the defense barely holding up.
So I went for the teleporters and gunned them down. Again, we merely had a level 1 sentry, but the destruction of teleporters was enough to hold the ground.

On good days I am a pretty good scout. Although there are a couple of scouts who frequent reddit who are much better and can kick my ass. For what its worth here are my 2cents: 

1. Practice and learn to use your weapons. Basic, the stun can shut down one player and allow your teammates to take the advantage. I know competitive tf2 doesn't use sandman, but I personally love it and its my default load out. 

2. The scout is super powerful in some locations

3. At close range soldiers are instant death, firing heavies can kill in 2 seconds or less. Learn to disable them from a distance - hit and run. hit and run and avoid close confrontations. Natasha is a killer - get out asap. 

4. Pistol is great - back peddle and load clip after clip into those chasing you. Pistol can also take out unattended sentries - it has great range. Pistol is extremely effective against pyros who tend to think they can fry scouts easily. When they are flaming backpeddle and shoot pistol

5. I don't care what anyone says: the choice between scattergun and FaN is simply a matter of the current game play. If I am playing against heavies or on a map with a pit

6. Be aggressive against demos, snipers, spies. Be cautious against battle medics and other scouts (look at your health). Be very careful against heavies and soldiers. 

7. Avoid direct (face to face) confrontations. Approach from the side and hit and run. Learn to aim while in the air and jumping/double jumping. Firing at speed with a mid-air change of direction can close the deal. 

8. Learn the Tyson stalk

Here's a couple of my favorite 'off the cuff' tips:

- As a **Heavy**

- As a **Pyro**, or reflecting rockets at an enemy's feet for spectacular results.  If you're feeling very daring, try using an enemy rocket to rocket jump! 

- As a **Soldier**

- As a **Scout**

- As a **Spy**, then jump on(and crouch!) or over and behind them and plant the knife in their back for a stair stab.

- As an **Engineer**, be mindful of the biggest factors that cause sentry death.  Edging(firing around a corner or over a wall), out-ranging(firing out of range the sentry), ambushing (dropping on and overwhelming a sentry) and splashing (using stray explosives to deal damage) are all valid and effective techniques used to destroy sentries without the use of an ubercharge.

- As a **Medic**

- As a **Demoman**

- As a **Sniper**, spies, scouts, engineers, and especially medics) or severely weaken heavier enemies(-150 HP from Soldier, Demo, Pyro

1328520063.0,pd02e,Mini-Sentry Offensive/Defensive Engineer w/ Vanilla Shotgun Strategy,FuckYouImFunny,18,0,12,"I just wanted to give a strategy guide on a mini-sentry Engy. I feel that the class is one of the most powerful classes because it is so versatile. An Engineer is really pivotal for a team (in a pub that is) in that they can heal (dispenser)

My load out is Vanilla Shotgun

**Mini-Sentry**

* 100 health (300 when Wrangled)
* 100 metal cost
* 48 damage per second (96 when Wrangled)
* 3 seconds to build (1.5 when picked up and placed)

**Vanilla Shotgun**

* 86-90 point blank damage
* 24-67 midrange damage
* 3-26 longrange
* 6 bullets fully loaded

**Dispenser**

* Level 1 Dispenser: 100 metal, 40 metal/sec
* Level 2 Dispenser: 300 metal, 50 metal/sec
* Level 3 Dispenser: 500 metal, 60 metal/sec

**Teleport**

* Level 1: 10 seconds recharge time
* Level 2: 5 seconds recharge time
* Level 3: 3 seconds recharge time

First and foremost

* You need to be an *Engineer* and not an offensive machine. That means set up Dispensers in hidden areas where your teammates are pushing/defending and building teleports. The only time you should skip those is if you're team is pushing incredibly fast or if your mini-sentry keeps dying on defense and they're pushing your team fast. You are a family man.

* I don't use Frontier Justice because of the 3 bullets per clip compared to the vanilla's 6 bullets. I like to rush my enemies with the shotgun as I place my sentry. This is normally the best option against all the classes besides Pyro, they might end up doing more damage to themselves as well since they'll have to shoot near themselves. If you have your mini-sentry behind you and can dish out 50 damage/sec with your shotgun, you're doing 100 damage/second to your opponent (with the 48 dmg/sec from the mini-sentry).

* I like to normally build a mini-sentry right behind a corner so I can pick it up and place it. It takes 1.5 seconds to build up if you do that, especially when your teammates are pushing. No one thinks to shoot at the mini-sentry when a medic + someone else are nearby. It pushes people back and injures/kills them. It also distracts them (there's a flashing light on it for a reason) which allows your teammates to survive as your mini-sentry might be their next target.

* Wrangle your gun to take out classes that are far away. It sounds stupid

* If you're getting chased by someone and have metal, and back pedal and shoot while they focus on me or the mini-sentry. It's a great plan since they waste ammo on the mini-sentry and you're able to damage them as you move farther away. It's worked a lot and will save your life.

* Continue building mini-sentries like wildfire. If you don't constantly have one up, so you might as well build it farther away so it's harder for them to destroy it. It is stupid how a mini-sentry deters Pyros/Scouts... it seriously will keep a team at bay if you keep building one and have teammates who can spam. 

* Do not carry a Dispenser/Teleport half way across a map. You're job is to push the cart and make a safe haven of a base. The only thing you should move (and a short distance at that) is the mini-sentry. You have to continue to build and move a mini-sentry up as your team pushes. Build Dispensers/Teles after you've secured a particular location on the map.

* Script your keys so you can build new sentries, otherwise you'll have a harder time building mini-sentries again and again. 

* Downhills/Uphills are your friends. Instead of placing them on a flat surface in front of an uphill

* Mini-sentry Engy w/ Vanilla SG is much more useful on offense than defense. On defense

You will win MVP if you do everything correctly. You push the cart, get healing points (or extinguishing), and teleport points.

If you wish to confirm this, even if you are holding your medigun or melee weapon.

To further explain how this mechanic affects gameplay:

In case you haven't noticed

The ""default"" rate of HP regeneration for the medic is 3-6 HP.  That is, the blutsauger gives the medic's passive HP regeneration a passive debuff of -2 HP per second.  A blutsauger medic that has just taken damage heals at 1 HP per second, and a blutsauger medic that has not taken damage in the past 10 seconds will heal at 4 HP per second.

Does the syringe gun's passive regen buff really give it that big of an advantage over the blutsauger?  I did some experimentation using the hurtme command inside spawn.  (The results I got were slightly different from what I had expected; the way that the game rounds is kind of funky.)  Here are some comparisons (based on the experimental results):

* A syringe gun medic who takes damage

* A syringe gun medic who takes damage

But I just wanted to share some things I've learned that have made Demoknighting quite fun instead of an exercise in masochism. 

For me, the Splendid Screen, and the Persian Persuader.

The shoes/pegleg give you extra hit points so you have 200 HP like the Soldier. The Persian Persuader does not shave your hit points

The Splendid Screen I have found better than the Chargin' Targe despite the latter's increase in fire and explosion damage. The Splendid Screen deals much more damage on impact which is crucial for what I call ""Hit and Slit"". It also produces a satisfying ""Awww!"" when you hit someone; something I don't believe the Targe does.

The best way to play I've found is to act like a spy. You can't rush head first into battles. Despite your high HP

This is the basic strategy of attack. When you catch someone unaware, and then slit. Wait for everything to shake before slitting so you don't cancel your charge. I've found hitting from behind is most successful. I don't know if there is a damage bonus but it sure seems like it. Hit and slit and their heads come right off. I'm not sure about the math but it seems like I can take out heavies like this (they may have be a little low on health already though).

1347857296.0,100bia,I feel like I've reached a skill-level block.,toxicthunder,19,2,24,"Hello everyone. 

I am not really new (~300 hours of TF2), pyro and soldier. And for each of these classes, I feel like I've come to some sort of mid-level block: I cant seem to get better.

Compared to back when I started (about 2 months ago), soldier, pyro, engineer, medic and sometimes demoman and sniper. 

Anyway, here is my list of problems with each classes:

**Soldier:**

I HATE scouts. I can deal with them at close range, and my shotgun does little damage. So, I just RJ away, or suicide by going near him and shooting a rocket near me. So, any advice on how to deal with scouts would be good.

My normal Loadout: The Original or RL

**Pyro:**

This is the class which I feel like I have reached a max skill level at. I pretty much do everything that pyros should do: cause chaos, and guard sentries (using homewrecker as melee). But, I still cannot kill soldiers with their reflected rockets. Good soldiers almost always kill me. Scouts are less of a problem, because if they come close, I burn them, and far away they are not much of a problem. Snipers are also not a problem because I use the Flare Gun. The main problem I have is DEMOMEN. I cant reflect their pipes and stickies (while they're launching it). Another problem is I almost always get killed by a trickstab. The sad thing is, I KNOW that the spy is going to trickstab me. So I go in thinking I can counter that trickstab, any help on how to deal with soldiers

Also, a medic and a soldier. There is lot of spam that the soldier is taking in. I am far from the spam and looking out for spies and flanks, while the medic is healing the soldier. Now, the soldier gets lighted on fire by the enemy. Should I go in and extinguish him? He is low on health, and healing from medic only helps a little when there are flames. But, if I go close, I would also get hit by spam, *try to* save your team or *save* yourself)?

*My normal loadout:* Stock Flamethrower

*Small note:* I prefer stock flamethrower because for a long time I did not have the degreaser. So I got used to using the flamethrower and flare gun. THen, like my flames didnt matter at all. So I stopped using it. Should I use it again?

**Engineer:**

I like playing both the offensive AND defensive engineer. Particularly, next round, I decide to be an engineer, but its useless because their spy get all my mini sentries. So, when do you decide to be an engineer? Also, can someone please tell me the priority of buildings - is it teleporter &gt; dispenser &gt; sentry (specially when I'm and offensive engineer)?

*My normal loadout:* Shotgun (or Pomson), and Frontier Justice, Pistol and Gunslinger on offense.

**Medic:**

Medic is the class I love playing, I know when to heal players, how to prioritize, and not pocket the same person all the time. But, the thing I suck is at WHEN to pop an uber. Say, I have an uber, but there are not that many enemy players to take care of *at the moment*. So, BAM

Quick question: Who should I uber at the start of payload map - Heavy

*My normal loadout:* The Medivial Medic - Crusaders Crossbow

Hope that wasnt long enough that you got bored while reading it! Also

* Remember: **YOU** are more important than the guy you're healing. If he's taking heavy damage even with your healing

* Don't overstretch your safety zone. Hide behind corners, soldier, and pyro you passed up to get to the scout. 

* Learn how to bravely run away. Don't backpedal and try to get a pick with your syringe gun. You move slower running backwards, but shots fired at your back will give you a little push when you're running, aiding your escape. Add a crouch to your jump for best results. 

* If points matter to you

* Always. Always. **ALWAYS** check your back and everyone around you. Spies are gonna take you and your heal target out if you aren't alert. it's as easy as walking into them. Most spies are too slow to realize they've been found out. Switch to your saw and tear em up (Ubersaw doesn't charge uber against disguised/cloaked spies). Learn to spot a dead ringer, saw em to death. It's embarrassing to heal a spy and watch him lazily stab your heal target and get away with it. 

* Learn who on your team is putting in the most work

* That doesn't mean ignore everyone else, take some time and heal that soldier who just took out a sentry nest. 

* Don't be stingy with your ubercharge. If your heal target suddenly dies or you see a crit rocket on its way

* You can block a capture while ubered

* At the same time, very impractical, but possible. Also, switching weapons allows you to cap a point/move the cart while your heal target has a second or two of ubercharge until his dies off too. if you need the extra push, be a sneaky medic and swap weapons and get the cap!

It's a long con tool, to go for the teleporters with minimum risk (or telefrag if you're lucky, otherwise it'll most likely earn you a wrench to the face).
Once the teleporters are down, like a sniper or engineer who's just a little too far from the teammates.

In fact, making it easier to circumvent the defenses, but without metal supplies, you'll be either really slow or really vulnerable.

A simple way to tell the game mode is by the first letters of the name of any map in the server list.  This will usually be followed by an underscore


* **[pl_ : Payload](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Payload)**  The object of this game mode is for one team to ""push"" the cart from one end of the map to the objective in a set amount of time while the other team attempts to stop them.  On the cart's tracks are several checkpoints, and it automatically moves along the tracks.  The more people that stand near the cart, the faster it moves.  If no one is near the cart for a set amount of time, it will start moving backwards, but will not move past the most recent checkpoint or the beginning.  You can see the current progress of the cart at the bottom of the screen, which will indicate how many players are near it, and if it is moving forwards or backwards.  The cart also acts like an engineer's dispenser

* **[plr_ : Payload Race](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Payload_Race#Payload_Race)**  This game has the same objective as Payload

* **[ctf_ : Capture The Flag](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Capture_the_Flag)**  The objective is to get into the team's base, it will remain in place for 60 seconds, and afterwords will return to the base.  Indicators on the screen will show the status of each intelligence and where on the map it is in relation to yourself.  Usually in these maps, each side of the base is an exact mirror image of the other.

* **[cp_ : Control Point](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Control_Point_%28game_mode%29)** The objective of Control Point is to stand on a point until it is ""captured"" by your team.  There are two types of Control Point maps.  One is where a team will attack while the other defends, where there are control points that each team controls, and only one point can be captured at any given time; you must capture a point to unlock another, but the other team can capture it back from you!

* **[arena_ : Arena](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Arena)** Two teams, a central Control Point will open, whichever team can capture it before they all die will win.

* **[koth_ : King of the Hill](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/King_of_the_Hill)** A single control point in the middle of the map is fought over for control.  When under your team's control

* **[tc_ : Territorrial Control](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Territorial_Control)** Two random sections of the map are set up for fighting over; after being captured

How/where does airblast properly fit in during this process?

The axe is melee range.  How do you close the gap between you and the enemy in order to land the hit?  In my early attempts I end up just flailing my axe around a foot away from my enemy as he fills me with lead ""-_-

W+M1 Pyros are those who play Pyro that simply kamikaze you invariably, no trying to outwit the other player - just fire + run at opponent. With enough experience this makes them easy to deal with almost all of the time, but you can almost imagine the player on the other side of the screen just simply holding down the mouse and the W button and then getting frustrated at their repeated deaths.

Effectively playing a Pyro requires a different mindset. Pyros are weak on frontal attacks—they will lose to most other classes if they see him coming. However

Also helpful:

* Learn to light enemies up
* Strafing and circlestrafing should be your best friends - pyros have low health but move quickly
* Learn the arc on the flare gun; once you can aim well with it it's massively useful, the flare gun now deals mini-crits to enemies already on fire, making it particularly effective for lighting-up-and-retreating. It's also great for weakening big groups, and aiming in these cases is a piece of cake. By using walls and corners to hide behind, pop out and shoot a flare, hide again to reload and repeat you will be tricky to hit and you'll have weakened the group(/individual) before they even get to you.
* Pyros are the only class in the game that can _counter projectiles_ - it almost seems crazy to type that out! What an amazing ability! And yet very few players seem to even know that the airblast (M2/right-click) exists. You can use it to offensively blast projectiles back in the face of those who shot them (timing is key here - you'll get the hang of it fairly quickly, extinguish teammates on fire, blast players off ledges, or delay enemies (simply by blowing them backwards, into obstructions or into the air - this is particularly devious on Ubercharged pairs! If you can keep them back or seperate the medic from the other CP it can mean a wasted Uber for the other team). The list goes on. This should be your best friend.

And don't forget to taunt. Pyros have the coolest taunt in the whole freakin' game.

**Prices in the store do not correspond to prices in the TF2 trading economy.** Additionally, a ""dirty"" Archimedes goes for about 2-3 keys, about $5 or $7.50, contrasting this with the $12 from the store. A ""clean"" Archimedes goes for about 6-7 keys, about $15 dollars in keys. (I am not going to go into purchasing keys from third parties, I am well aware of the reduced price of keys, the point still holds with the Mann Co prices

Chances are you want to get into trading

* 2 keys, 0.11 is a scrap metal, so 2.5 is 2 refined + 1 reclaimed + 2 scrap.)
* A backpack expander
* 5 tour of duty tickets, just to do the whole tour.
* Buy the cheapest thing in the Mann Co. store

Usually, you're still better off buying the keys and then trading for the hat you want.

*If you're looking for weapons

An additional option
is to buy six tour tickets for Mann Up mode (for a total of $6)

**Crates are not worth opening.** To get an idea of how bad it is

Tips for players:

* **Don't hit that medic button unless you're in real danger of dying soon**. I can't stress how annoying it is when it's the middle of an intense fight and 9001 people are calling for medic. The medics know you're hurt; don't need to make it more stressful for them.
* Take care of your damn medic. Save health packs for the medic. If you're a heavy, run out of the battle so he can grab health. If you're overhealed and you have rocket spam heading your way, take the hits or airblast it away. **Just don't let him die.**
* Don't even bother calling for a medic if you're a scout. You're the fastest class in the game. Go back behind the lines and pick up a health pack that the medics aren't near.

Tips for medics:

* Don't just uber me once you get 100%. I might be low on ammo or have nothing loaded. A polite warning is sufficient.
* On contrary to above
* Try to keep people overhealed
* When I play medic
* Communicate! This ties into the two previous points. If you're about to use your uber, call it out. The medic is the prime leader class; they can assess the situation easier because they pretty much have to pay attention to everything. The flow of the game depends on medics.",,False,,t5_2rbtk,False,,

1) Use the quick weapon switching option - with this you won't need to left click to select a weapon

2) Don't use the scroll wheel to change weapons (unless it works for you) - my scroll wheel was too sensitive

3) If you're not comfortable with the default keys to switch weapons, click for melee. For weapon slot 4, I use Q. Mess with the controls and find something that works for you.

4) I personally don't use this, you can assign some key combinations (ex: select disguise kit+select disguise) to one key. Experienced players could elaborate for me in the comment. For the rest of you, you can google it.

It's a pretty exciting scene, but understandably it's hard to know where to start! /r/tf2lft is an excellent resource, and it's where I found my own team! But if everyone is as new as you are, it can be hard to make work

The Round Robin is pretty awesome in that it's a one day tournament. So you get the feel of progression in a short period of time. There are two tournaments, give you a team mentor to prepare you for the tournament. This is especially geared towards the newer players and is a wonderful experience as you get the benefit of mentoring with players better than you, and you get introduced to a group of people with roughly similar skills, who are looking to get better at the game.

1345652449.0,yn6tk,"Error, File Not Found: A Wave by Wave Guide to Decoy, Disk Deletion.",NaiDriftlin,18,3, and MVPs and LVPs associated with each wave.

---------------------------------
**Wave 1:** *Obligatory Pyro Wave*

**Max Cash(w/Bonus):** 700

**Consists of...**

- **Pyros**
- **Boxing heavies**
- **Sombrero(Flare Gun) Pyros**

The Pyro Wave is a simple matter of gunning enemies down.   The best stratedgy is the simplest one: Shoot them dead.   Spys suffer a significant disadvantage in this wave due to how early it is(400 cash means only one upgrade to the sapper, soldiers, demos, and engineers will enjoy how relatively easy this round is.

Most importantly, and having a pyro and/or a scout collecting the money.   Yes, that means having 4 engineers and 2 scouts is an absolutely valid method to dealing with this wave, provided no one spends money on upgrades.

Boxing heavies will also spawn

**MVP(s):** Engineers

**LVP(s):** Spies

**Common Troubles:** Giant Pyros getting a hold of the bomb while sentries and players are distracted by the larger number of smaller enemies.

 ---------------------------------

**Wave 2:**  *The Lucksman Wave*

**Max Cash(w/Bonus):** 700

**Consists of...**

- **Huntsman Snipers (96 of them!)**
- **Support Spies**

This should be another freebie wave

The Engineer is king of this round, but Snipers can out range the sentry if it is on autopilot only, and robot spies will be hard to manage if you have to fight both them and the huntsmen snipers at once with the wrangler.  Pay attention to where the bomb carrier will be going, and build for that.  If they are going left, either up the ramp or across the bridge, putting your sentry on the left ramp(either at the top of the ramp, or at the corner of the wooden area close to the rock with the full ammo and full health pack) will cover most of the critical areas, or up the ramp on the left, or to your right and left flanks

The other silent heroes of this wave are Soldiers and Demos.  Demos and soldiers can hide around corners and use stickies/rockets to deal splash damage from safety.  Since both use weapons powerful enough to kill snipers in 1 or 2 hits they can safely dispatch stragglers or partial waves by themselves if they play the corners right.  Heavies enormous close range DPS means that hiding around a corner will work

Scouts, as is anyone else who may need to get in close quarters with the snipers.

**MVP(s):** Engineer, using corners.

**LVP(s):** Anyone in close range

**Common Troubles:**

- Spies killing the engineer/demo/heavy/soldier and/or sapping the sentry while it is firing on huntsmen.

- Sentry busters coinciding with a wave of Huntsmen rounding the corner a sentry is on.

---------------------------------

**Wave 3:** *Giant Scouts and Little Soldier Boys*

**Max Cash(w/Bonus):** 550

**Consists of...**

- **Giant Scouts (6)
- **Soldiers**

This wave goes to the Pyro.  No one is better equipped to handle this wave than he is.  However, but can be stopped by air blasting them into the air.  The rest of the team can then focus them down so long as the pyro holds them in place.    If a scout gets by your team with the bomb, he will, most likely, end the wave before any of you have a chance to get back to spawn.  Your highest priority is stopping that scout.

The soldier waves are very dangerous to exposed sentries and anyone who happens to be inside the tunnel when they touch ground.  NO ONE should be inside the tunnel, preferably while retreating to retrieve more ammo for the next giant scout.  If you're going to be a career pyro in this game, expanded ammo tanks as an upgrade is the way to go, but if you're going pyro for this round only, play it safe and restock ammo between giant scouts.  There is a 1/2 ammo box up the left ramp, on the right next to the wall, and there is a full ammo on top of the building in the center if you can't reach a dispenser.  If you're only swapping for the wave, personally.

Everyone else should be focusing on killing the scouts and soldiers.  Due to the narrow space of which the soldiers have to walk, and the rest of your team should be able to quickly mop up what is left.

**MVP(s):** W+M2 Pyro

**LVP(s):** Anyone who stands in the tunnel when the soldiers hit the ground.

**Common Problems:**

- Scouts get past the pyro, Jarate sniper, or spy on the team.

- Pyros trying to be a reflect hero during a soldier spawn and getting killed by soldiers

---------------------------------

**Wave 4:** *Rock'Em Sock'Em Heavies*

**Max Cash(w/Bonus):** 500

**Consists of...**

- **Boxing Heavies**
- **Support Spies**
- **Support Snipers**

It's an easy wave.  Believe it or not, spies and snipers should focus on snipers.  Scouts are the breadwinners in this wave thanks to their speed and ability to quickly catch up to and dispatch both spies and snipers.  Engineers should build their sentry with their backs against a wall(Either on the left or right, depending on where the bomb carrier is going), and leave their sentry on auto-pilot while keeping an eye out for spies, and only swapping to the wrangler to kill distant snipers.

**MVP(s):** Scout

**LVP(s):** Anyone who gets killed by the heavies

**Common Problems:**

- Snipers and spies kill big hitters(Heavy, Engineer, Pyro) and classes with less output are over-run by heavies.

- Sentry buster forcing an engineer to pick up his gear

- Multiple snipers near spawn, heavies) before they can get back into position.

What I'm posting this for is that obviously NewToTF2 needs an official server. I am not done helping with TF2 servers just because of a bad experience and I just setup a 10 slot idle server in hopes to get this started and if not i'll leave the idle one up.

What I want to do is make a single 24 slot server. The cost of this is $28.79/mo. I can cover 10 slots of this myself which is about $11/mo. I'd pay for the whole thing but my finances are as tight as can be right now. I'm not asking for anything crazy. All I need to get this started is $17 and $17 every month on. I don't want some crazy amount of donations because I'm not trying to pocket anything here.

As far as features go I want to hear from the community what you want to see on a server. Obviously I will give items away if they are donated

**FYI**: I just put up a 24 slot payload and CP server up: 74.91.122.35:27015 (Located in Chicago)

EDIT: **I wanted to come back and state that this server sadly will NOT be an official server for NewtoTF2.

1322850105.0,mxrr2,Initial thoughts trying to play Heavy...,GyantSpyder,17,4,22,"Relatively rew player (played about a month and a half) - been moving through the classes trying them out. Had the most fun/success so far with Medic, which I'd previously found to be really annoying - very hard to make a difference at all. Wanted to post some initial reactions and questions and ask for feedback from more experienced players.

- There is definitely a temptation to play the Heavy as longer-range - aim at someone or a group of people from somewhere relatively safe from snipers and hope you can just pump out enough bullets to do damage or at least suppress the other team a bit. Any success at all I was having seemed to start when I realized this was stupid. 

(I tried the same tactic with Soldier and was told on this board that was wrong

- So, but then I also feel like my team probably needs me on the front lines. How do you manage that?

- Is it just me, or if there aren't enough medics or even any medics to go around? (I'm assuming the answer to the last one is ""switch to medic,"" right?)

- How important is the sandvich? I don't have it yet (I have the dolokos bar

- Just playing around early on, which seems cool and which I've wanted to use. But it just seems terrible! I had thought that combining the brass beast with a more mobile secondary weapon like shotgun or the gloves of running urgently (which I do have) would let me put out more damage without sacrificing an intolerable amount of mobility, but the more I play with it the worse it seems. Is the movement and spin-up penalty as bad as it feels to me, or is brass beast at least playable enough for rookies on public servers? Any tips on how to use it? What is the deal with the different primary weapons?

- Sentry guns are tough to deal with! No other commentary on that

- Wow

- Pyros seem to rush at me a lot, even if they're weaving around. But I still feel like I could do better against them. Any tips for how to engage pyros or scouts other than just shoot them and kill them? Again, seems like a good matchup, but it's common enough that improving it would have some benefits.

- I pretty much always load up the Gloves of Running Urgently and use them to sprint to the front lines. Is this a good idea

- Are there any aiming tricks for heavy like there are for other classes? Aim at a particular part of the body or fire at a particular time? Or do you basically just point and shoot?

- Same question

Rushing leads to poor decisions, or the items are imposters.

** Price check **

This is very important when dealing with valuable items(not so important with normal weapons). You can look at past trades, you can't trust the person that you're trading with for a good price check.

**Remember that normal weapons are really

You can buy most normal weapons for 1 scrap metal

** Buy keys from the store

With the exception of a few items(the jumpers, sell them for 2.3 or 2 refined each.

** Purely cosmetic does not mean low value

In fact, break it down efficiently. Don't trade your Team Captain for a Razorback because you don't play Soldier, you could get lots more items for that. For normal hats, try to sell them for metal(price check first), then break down the metal and buy some weapons. I've heard of way too many people trading a hat they thought to be useless for a handful of weapons, when they could have earned a TON of weapon for it.

** Don't craft weapons

Most crafting recipes call for at least 1 scrap metal and another weapon. You could buy the weapon for that 1 scrap metal. Also when you craft hats, and not only do you save, you get more control.

EDIT: Hey look, but a little more than the 1 ref to buy craft hats in bulk(doesn't look like it's worth the effort tbh, I'm sure scrap banking + weapon sales earns and more faster without the risk).",,False,,t5_2rbtk,,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/j636f/some_tips_regarding_trading_crafting_and_buying/

1262995587.0,ancs9,Spy Tips (Sorted by topic),Shaleblade,17,3,7,"**WEAPON CHOICE:**

* The [Ambassador](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Ambassador) looks cool, but its poor rate of fire and lower base damage makes it a very poor emergency weapon. The [Revolver](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Revolver) makes a much better emergency weapon, as it has a high crit rate, good damage, fast reload, and a great fire rate. If you're still unsatisfied by the revolver's blandness, download some [skins here](http://www.fpsbanana.com/skincats/1903).

* If you have the [Cloak and Dagger](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Cloak_and_Dagger), it allows you to pick and choose your targets much easier instead of being thrown into hopefully-good situations.

* The [Dead Ringer](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Dead_Ringer) requires much more ""acting"" (*see further down the post for a section on acting*) than the other watches

**WEAPON USAGE**

* Despite the Ambassador's lackings in being a quality getaway weapon

* You're just about to backstab that lone Medic, and you miss. You're left undisguised, and in great danger. His teammates could be ready to pop around the corner at a moment's notice! If you fail to stab your target, *do not continue to swipe at him*. Sure, you may be able to pull off a [facestab](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Facestab#Facestab), but you're very likely to die either way. Instead, take out your Revolver and retreat as you try to gun him down; the [Butterfly Knife](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Knife) and the Revolver have the same base damage. When you either kill the target or get out of their sight

**DISGUISING**

* If you're going to disguise

* Be sure to switch up your disguises. Your enemies will often catch on

* Remember to change your weapons. Believe it or not

* When disguised

	1. Running the opposite way. If you see a friendly Pyro running away from the point directly at you

	2. Looking at the enemy team. Try to keep the enemy in your sights without directly looking at them.

	3. Forgetting context. Don't disguise as a Scout defending the point. Be sure to act like a Sniper when you're on your local Sniper deck.

**INFILTRATION**

* The Dead Ringer is a great infiltration weapon; disguising as a teammate (I prefer Scout with his Bat out) and trying to see how far you can run past the enemy without them triggering your DR is effective

* Spy suicide runs are rarely as helpful as well thought-out strategies. Try not to repeat the same tactic twice in a row. If you find yourself stuck in a situation

* With the Cloak and Dagger, Soldier/Demo/Heavy/Whatever+Medic combos, sticky traps, *anything*. No matter what your watch choice, you need to be sure to tell your team *everything* you see. This alone will take you from the level of ""Skillless nub"" to ""Invaluable recon"".

 **WRONG!!**

Pyro is a very versatile class well suited to both offensive and defensive roles. (S)he excels in ambush tactics, and keeping constant pressure on groups of enemies. The compression blast is an amazingly useful tool that anyone seeking to play pyro should train to use effectively. 

*Offense* 

* Your best bet is taking alternate routes to the objective area. These routes often contain many corners which are ideal for you to hide behind and set anyone else ablaze. They also frequently put you in a more desirable location by the objective

* You are one of four key classes for a medic to give ubercharge to. Consistent

* Pay attention on the front lines for spies sneaking around. You're cursed with being obligated to spycheck EVERYONE, if they're still on fire after you burned them, use your compression blast and keep them controlled. Your fire will do next to no damage while the dead ringer cloak is active, so juggle them until it wears off or pull out a shotgun and finish them off. Your team may try to help you out too, but you're the best suited for dealing with the spy. 

* Use your compression blast liberally. it's easy to pick up ammo on most maps

* A very potent tactic as pyro is to use your flamethrower and axetinguisher or postal pummeler. It will take down every class besides heavy in one hit. The Degreaser's faster weapon switch makes this a fluid motion. Adding a compression blast to control your victim's movement is also recommended. The stock flamethrower is your next best bet as the compression blast is  still only 20 ammo

* keep your opponent overwhelmed with your fire

* If you're skulking around on your own, if your team has no medic, a better option is to go medic instead. 

*Defense*

* Hold off narrow choke points

* stick with the engineer and his buildings

* The Homewrecker/maul or the Neon Annihilator remove sappers from friendly buildings. once you've dealt with the spy

* constantly put out teammates that get set on fire. you're a big help in keeping them alive when behind the lines.
 
* If you see the enemy has a teleporter



**For secondary weapons**

* the stock shotgun is my personal choice. you can hit enemies underwater

* The flare gun is the next best option, spies, engineers, or medics with relative ease. However, it takes a trained eye and hand to aim the flare gun, and the reload time leaves you vulnerable to attack. 

* The reserve shooter is another choice of shotgun. In my experience, it makes an effective combo with it. the minicrits on airborne targets mean the compression blast sends them up, your reserve shooter brings them down. make sure you're a good shot, though, you only have 3 per clip. this is why I prefer the stock shotgun, six shots mean you'll take down an enemy pyro faster as well. 

* The manmelter shouldn't be used much. the reload is slower than the flare gun

* The Detonator is similar to the flare gun, and very situational. You're best off with the flare gun if you want to use it. 

* The scorch shot is similar to the detonator, but costs more health at no extra height or distance. pick the detonator if you want to flare jump. 


I'll continue with primary and melee in a different post at a later date. I need to wrap it up here for now though. I think I covered the basics and the important stuff.

I'm a fairly new tf2 (this game rocks) player with barely 20 hours played in soldier class. I've been practicing rocket jumping after seeing all those cool videos where people can just fly through the air like a bird. I can do the basic look straight at your feet and fire rocket jump but I can't seem to do the sideways rocket jumping even though I've been practicing for hours and watching tons of tutorials about it :(

I know I am a bit crap and I have read just about every guide I can find

Generally speaking I like to play either heavy or medic and I have about 4 hours on each class. I seem to prefer payload games mainly because it's harder to get lost on the payload maps. I think heavy suits me best because I can bludgeon my way along the tracks without requiring too much finesse. If there are a load of heavies and no medics though I am happy to be a medic. So here are my questions:

Are there any servers I should avoid? i don't mind the fact that I will get beaten to a pulp sometimes but I don't want to piss other people off by being crap.

As a heavy

As a medic

If someone is yelling ""medic"" when they are close to full health is it OK to ignore them while other people need healing? It seems to be mainly heavies that do this and I am happy to pocket a heavy when they are pushing forward and there are no other players on low health.

Is there anything else I should consider?

Cheers.

I have played TF2 on and off (more on than off) since the beta. I am in no means an amazing TF2 player. I would consider myself only above average. However I have picked up on enough about pubbing to understand the key points that usually determine an easy defense. The pyro/engineer duo is one of them

The engineer has great firepower, good ubers, and average demoman.

The pyro can roast spies, or if only the medic is targeted for the blast, you can simply cut off the uber. When demomen start tossing those stickies on the sentry it is no problem, simply push them away with a nice blast of compressed air. Pipe bombs landing at the engineers feet about to kill him? Hit them with some air and watch as they turn a different color and harmlessly explode. Soldier are also fun to play with, have a soldier wasting your engineers metal? Blast those rockets back and watch as he rages!

As you can see the pyro and engineer are a match made in heaven. They go together like beer and pizza or whatever cliched analogy you wish to use. I hope some new player will take note of this and the next time you see an engineer on your team with no one to help him

I recommend that you begin playing primarily on payload maps as you learn the game.  (Payload maps have a pl_ prefix, you shoot at the blue guys who are standing next to the cart.  It's also hard to get lost on a payload map, and if you're ever unsure of which direction to head to get to the action, just follow the train tracks.

#After you've got the basics down, but most people tend to treat it like a free-for-all deathmatch, and you seldom see any actual teamwork on these maps.  ctf_2fort is an okay map for learning the fundamentals of how your class's mechanics work, but once you've had an hour or so to figure things out, move onto payload maps.

-------

Certain classes tend to be more  than others. The most versatile are medic, bad on asymmetrical ones, and he's a bit more difficult to get good with. The rest of the classes are all somewhat situational and you can try them to see if you like them but you don't need to make learning them a priority if you don't particularly enjoy playing them.  Besides those mentioned, the heavy is pretty easy to pick up and play, and he's arguably borderline OP (he's gotten some mad buffs in the past several months; there's a good chance some of them may get rolled back in the near future).  Heavy is one of the easier classes to top the scoreboard with, but you make more enemies than friends by playing him.

I'd recommend avoiding servers with more than 24 players. Beyond that point, but 24-player servers are decent if you are starting out.  Generally, servers with higher player counts tend to be more forgiving of newer players; in a large game it's easier to get lost in the crowd, and no one will get mad at you for not pulling your weight if you have ten teammates to carry you.

#If you have a mic

-------

Every so often

In addition, 10, and 15 achievements (or 10, 15, and 20 achievements in some cases).  Each of these milestones is tied to a specific weapon, so each class has three weapons that can be obtained via achievement.  (Some classes have more than three weapons; the other weapons must be obtained via random drop or crafting, see below.)  If you want to find out whether a certain unlockable weapon is available via achievements, you can look it up on [the official TF2 wiki](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Main_Page).

As an alternative to achievements or waiting for random drop specific weapons can be crafted if you have extra duplicate weapons.  [This is explained here.](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Crafting)  Non-achievement weapons each have a specific recipe that will generate that specific item 100% of the time if you have the right ingredients.  Every weapon in the game can be crafted using the ""generic"" recipe that uses two tokens and a scrap metal

The ideal way to obtain weapons is via random drop, the next recommended course of action is either achievement (if applicable) or unique recipe (if not applicable).  Generic recipes should be a last ditch effort to obtain something that you cannot feasibly obtain via achievement or lack the ingredients to craft via unique recipe.

#Once you've obtained all of the weapons that are relevant to your interests, or by crafting.  If you want to craft a random hat, you will need a total of 54 extra weapons.  Alternatively, there is a crafting recipe that gives you a bit of control over the outcome of crafting a hat by allowing you to choose the class that it is for, this recipe requires a grand total of 75 extra weapons.

-------

I recommend learning soldier very early on for a number of reasons.  The soldier's skill curve is relatively forgiving, specific to the soldier:

[How to play the soldier](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI29xEnfTzI)

[How to rocket jump

#[Soldier jumps for Badlands and Granary](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zN2LQbvcN_Y) (these are map-specific but incredibly helpful for those two maps, particularly those used on Granary.)

-------

Here's my list of ""must have"" weapons that you're going to want to get ASAP if they're for one of the classes that you play:

* Equalizer
* Axtinguisher
* Degreaser
* Sandvich
* GRU

#There are lots of other weapons you can obtain that are quite useful (I've grown quite fond of the bushwacka+jarate combo myself) so feel free to experiment with weapons as you find them.  Nearly every weapon can be viable under the right circumstances

-------

Be sure to check out the ""advanced"" settings under the ""multiplayer"" tab of the ""options"" menu.  You may wish to experiment with some of these and enable them at your discretion.  The main two options that I recommend changing from their defaults are ""display damage done as text over your target"" and ""automatically reload weapons when you're not firing.""  The damage display is especially helpful when you're starting out and are learning how much damage each weapon does from what ranges.  There's really no reason not to use auto-reload

As a Spy, that negative is far traded-off, I think by how much easier it is to maneuver through the inventory on the D-Pad of the controller. Disguising, switching to sapper, sapping the sentry, switching to the knife, missing the backstab, and more importantly, too...

I play a good deal of League of Legends, adding the 3rd dimension damn near gives me vertigo when I try to maneuver in a panic (like a pyro rush, etc) when combined with moving around using the alien feel of WASD.

**Double Engie Scout Blitz**


Phase One


Defensive Group Objective: 

Protect the Engineers while they are building so they can be self-sufficient in defending the intel. 


Offensive Group Objective: 

The Scouts will blitz the Enemy and take the Intel as much as possible before they can erect their own defenses.



Defensive Group:

2 Engineers

1-2 Pyros

1-2 Demos


Offensive Group:

3+ Scouts


Defensive Group Duties:

Engineers: Do *not* use the Gunslinger. Immediately run to your Intel Room and build Sentries *inside* the intel room as fast as possible. Upgrade to level three as fast as possible. Then build Dispensers and upgrade to level three as fast as possible. (You can build outside the Intel Room but make sure *all* routes are covered. For example, Demos, and Soldiers can come in and leave via the yard behind the Intel Room. Make sure it is covered.)

Pyros: Spy check and defend the buildings as the Engineers run to get more metal. Don't take metal they can  use. Conserve ammo until they get their dispensers up.

Demo


Offensive Group Duties:

Scouts: Go get the Enemy Intel as fast as possible before the enemy engies have their sentries up. If the enemy never sets up sentries or there are holes in their defenses where you will not be shot down by sentries


Phase Two:

Offensive Group Objective: 

Dismantle and destroy the Enemy Engineer positions so that the Intel can be recovered. Ignore any enemy offensive players and let them pass; your Defensive Group should be able to handle them.

Defensive Group Objective:

Guard the Intel and prevent sentries and other buildings from being destroyed.


Defensive Group:

2 Engineers

1 Pyro

Offensive Group:

1-2 Pyros

1-2 Heavies

1-2 Medics

1-2 Demos

1-2 Scouts

1-2 Soldiers

1-2 Snipers

1-2 Spies

Defensive Group Duties:

Engineers: These are the same two Engineers from Phase One. Guard the Intel.

Pyro: Guard the Engineers and their buildings and the Intel. Spycheck and use the Homewrecker to unsap sentries. 

Offensive Group Duties:

Pyros: Escort the Offensive Group into the enemy base. Sweep the area around the advancing team to kill spies. Keep the enemy at a distance.

Scouts: Harrass the enemy and escort the slower moving Heavies, grab the Intel and run home as fast as you can.

Snipers: Stay back and focus on taking out any enemies harrassing the advancing Offensive Group.

Spies: Harass the engineer positions. If possible

Heavy, Medics: Advance as a group but don't get too clustered to avoid group splash and fire damage. Focus on destroying sentries and getting to the Intel Room. Destroy all defenses and if there are no Scouts available, grab the Intel and run home.

Repeat Phase Two until victory is achieved.

* **TF2 is a team game**. Put everything you do in this context. If you are kredit to team
* Talk! Lets say you run around a corner and get blown up by a level three sentry. Fail? No! You have successfully gathered intelligence. Tell your team there is a sentry around the corner. We don't care if you say ""Gun thingy with rockets."" Just let everyone know whats there. You are a huge kredit to team if you do this kind of thing.
* If you talk
* Get ye to youtube
* For the love of god
* Be patient if you are moving to PC from console. Keyboard/Mouse was very awkward at first but after a few hours I was able to run down hallways without bumping into everything. Pyro and Medic were great first classes due to my lack of aiming ability, but I got used to it. I'm at 270ish now and could probably play scout if I actually practiced with him every once in a while.
* Around 40 hours I had enough understanding to start playing engie. #1 advice - make sure your tele exits don't face a wall. You might be kredit to team
* After accidentally killing someone with a shotgun as engie
* If you haven't played an FPS before

Overcharging only a heavy is pretty much useless to charge your uber when you can overcharge at least 5 or 6 people at the same time if they´re not under fire.
4. Collaborate with other medics with your mic.  3 ubers at the same time are a sure way to move the firing line in the right direction.
5. Never underestimate damage pyros cause on sentries.  An ubered pyro is fast enough to run through sentry fire and destroy engineer pits.  Ubering a heavy to do the same job may not get anything done since engineers can safely hide and repair under gunfire.

Started playing recently and I suck at spying.  I can't figure it out any more.  Have they changed it that much or are people just way paranoid now a days?  Seems any time I bump someone, somewhere, saw me do it and I die in 2 seconds.  Didn't used to be like that. 

Also did they buff pyros against spies?  Seems that the flamethrower kills me in about 1 second now a days.  

Additionally

Also did they decrease the time length that the cloak runs?  Seems pretty short now a days but my timing may just be off.  Find myself having to use the cloak and dagger to get anywhere.  I really dislike that thing but I can no longer seem to get to the enemy teleporters without having to sit around for a while

Oh and this is just a general question but I can't seem to find an answer to it:  as far as the dead ringer goes, move, decloak, and then try and use it again and it won't come up, even with a full cloak bar.  Do I have to get 'another one' from a dispenser/ammo drop or something?

And one more thing:  is it possible to do quick stabs any more or are you completely limited by the back stab animation?  Has a huuuuuge delay in it at the end that makes chaining difficult.  

And I guess just a general request for tips.  Been hunting around the net for updated/new spying techniques but all the youtube videos seem to be from around the time I stopped playing.

I stopped playing FPS games (or gaming at all) a little over 7 years ago after just starting University.  I have quite a lot of free time now after getting a job that's quite unpredictable on my hours.

I was heavily into cpm and then also warsow up until when I stopped playing.  Both of those games' regular communities appear to have died

I decided that I'd spend some time just optimising my setup first

In the end I've selected: 

* [yA_HUD](http://whayay.github.io/yA_HUD/)
* [Chris FPS](http://chrisdown.name/tf2/tf2configs-final.zip)
* My own custom CFGs for xhairs and the like

So I guess my first question is: *is this a reasonable setup? is there anything I've missed or bad things about the options I've chosen?*

Secondly, I'm a relatively fast study but I realise I have absolutely tonnes to learn as I've barely played even a few hours.  I'd like it if the games were semi-organised, I find it easier to refine my understand of *what-the-fuck-is-going-on* if I'm playing in a standard format so if there's anything like that for people that aren't good that people could point me to I'd appreciate it!

2) I still am not entirely sure what class I like best. I really liked the heavy in offline mode but I have typically liked support roles in other games. The medic seems cool but I die a hell of a lot and I see people complaining about medics only healing heavy. Do people run to the medic or expect the medic to run across the field looking for them? 

3) The spy seems interesting and I liked the sniper of course. In TF2 are there classes that are more desire than others? it seems like there is a lot of balance at least.

4) Does gear have any real affect? I see that some add bonuses

Knowing how to deal with players in a 1v1 scenario helps your overall understanding of the game



I'll start us off. 

Sniper vs Pyro

Sniper Rifle:  If at a range and the pyro is pelting you with shotgun bullets or flares, and can discourage players from drawing your attention.  A uncharged headshot will deal 150 damage, and leaves the pyro very vulnerable at 25 health.   If you are hit with a flare from a distance, run.  A second flare *will* kill you.


SMG: Back pedal and unload your SMG into the pyro.  If he tries to avoid the fire

Jarate + Bushwhacka:  A risky trick is to draw a pyro around a corner.  Time your jarate throw and soak him before he rounds it.  Swap to your Bushwhacka and quickly hit him with it.  If you can connect a melee hit while he's jarate'd, it's one of the few ways to deal with a pyro that's managed to get close.

1. The max drops you can get per week is between 8 and 10. Let's call it 9.      

2. Absolute worst case scenario you can sell 2 weapons to a scrap banker for 1 scrap.      

So easy math says 9 x 4 / 2 = 18 scrap

What I want to know is, you can get crates and hats and stuff. I know crates are like 7-9 per scrap, is that right? That would lower the expected value of the drop. But hats are worth more than weapons right? So that would raise the value of each drop.      

Does anyone know what the real price per drop is in metal?   ",,t5_2rbtk,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/lhqt3/out_of_curiosity_how_much_does_each_player_earn/

**Heavy**

Is it worth it to carry the shotgun rather than the sandvich or dahloks?  It seems like the shotgun wouldn't be any better than the minigun in any situation I can think of beyond times where you want to be mobile.

**Pyro**

Seems pretty obvious here

**Soldier**

This is my real confusion.  When does it make sense to use the Shotgun as Soldier?  It seems to me the only logical reason to use it is if you run out of rockets and you still need to finish someone off, but I don't know when to use it.

anyway, i was healing everything in sight, and helping hold our point effectively, i stayed alive for a long ass time as well. At one point i got stuck in a corner when my heavy got blown to bits by a blue heavy / medic combo. i was on a rocky incline around a corner, they didnt see me, i charged, i jumped, switched to my needle gun, and ran behind a rock

 i ran a few steps, man, what a feeling that was. i feel like i'm finally learning the game now, changing weapons effectively at the right times, and sort of in a groove. good times. nothing really productive here, just a good feeling after having fun in game!

#What is premium? Am I premium?

The premium accounts of TF2 have non-gameplay-effecting bonuses involving the in-game item system.

* Premium players have 300 slot backpacks (free players have 50)
* Premium players can find cosmetic items (free players can find weapons
* Premium players can trade items they have found (free players may only trade items given to them by others
* And

The ways of becoming a premium member are:
* Activating a retail copy of TF2 (this will also give you the Proof of Purchase hat)
* Purchasing something from the Mann Co. Store (this will also give you the Mann Co. Cap)
* Purchasing something from the Mann Co. Online Store (this will also give you the Mann Co. Online Cap) 
* Using an Upgrade to Premium Gift

# There are so many things to buy! What should I pick?

There are a couple of ways you can go about this...
* Many people on this sub suggest trying out a weapon, and you have the chance of finding it in-game (for free), so I wouldn't do this if I wanted some use out of my purchase.
* If you want lots of uncraftable weapons, they sell for a lot less. Once you have the key, you can either uncrate something (I suggest not; you'll lose profit 99% of the time) or you can sell the key for around 5 refined metal and 2 reclaimed metal, which you can then smelt into scrap, which you can then buy weapons with from something like scrap.tf.

I hope this post educated you on what premium acccounts are in TF2

With InvisiWatch, I can take a few pot shots with Revolver on low health classes, and then get away easily. With InvisiWatch I can be more strategical, but with Dead Ringer I can be more direct with kills. Also, with Dead Ringer, if I get hit by a Pyro I can take out my Spy - Cicle and lose a Pyro, but I can do so more efficiently with InvisiWatch but will be taking damage by other classes. 

With Spy - Cicle, but the ice statues gives away that there's a spy and they remain their for quite some time. Sometimes when I try to get trick stabs on Pyros I fail because it melts.

I love playing Demo as a faster, but stickies seem to have very limited options to me.
Having eight shots with high damage is good

1. Jumping: Meh
2. Traps: I find myself utterly bored with this
3. Airburst: Here's what really annoys me, due to the large blast radius, and then move out. You can literally see these things coming by a mile. I'm not particularly good at dodging, and I rarely ever die to this.
4. Spam: Spamming the point seems to be what most offense Demos are doing, since distracted enemies are pretty much a free kill who go down in less that two seconds if your pipebombs connect.

The two things that worked best for me was taking out sentries, e.g., if a group of RED is waiting for the payload cart there. That's about it. I'd swap the stickies for a Shotgun if that was an option...

**2.** Flare gun can crit for 90 dmg if the target is already on fire. Does it tick for 4.5 dmg every 0.5 seconds for 10 seconds or is it 90 dmg on impact? (I'm assuming it ticks for 4.5 dmg every 0.5 seconds?)

Autoexec.cfg gets run each time you connect to a server.  Maybe more often

My autoexec.cfg:

    alias vmoff ""r_drawviewmodel 0""
    alias vmon ""r_drawviewmodel 1""

I use these often later on.

I created a ""reset.cfg"" file that I source from every class-specific .cfg file.  When I change binds or settings in one of the other files, I also invoke the corresponding vm# alias to turn the viewmodel on or off.  The vm# aliases can be changed in the individual class files to turn viewmodels on or off for specific weapons.  By default I turn viewmodels off for everything except melee, which is always in slot 3.

reset.cfg:

    echo ""in reset.cfg""
    cl_autoreload 1
    zoom_sensitivity_ratio 1.0
    r_drawviewmodel 0

    bind mouse1 +attack
    bind mouse2 +attack2
    
    alias vm1 vmoff
    alias vm2 vmoff
    # viewmodels on for melee
    alias vm3 vmon
    alias vm4 vmoff
   
    bind 1 ""vm1; slot1""
    bind 2 ""vm2; slot2""
    bind 3 ""vm3; slot3""
    bind 4 ""vm4; slot4""


Here I created a +gopistol alias to let me hot-switch from scattergun to pistol by holding down the right mouse button.  When I let go of it

This is not useful when I'm using the sandman

When you bind a button to +aliasname

scout.cfg:

    echo ""in scout.cfg""
    exec reset.cfg

    alias scout_scat ""vm1; slot1; bind mouse2 +gopistol""
    alias scout_pistol ""vm2; slot2; bind mouse2 +gopistol""
    alias scout_bat ""vm3; slot3; bind mouse2 +attack2""
    
    bind 1 scout_scat
    bind 2 scout_pistol
    bind 3 scout_bat
    
    alias +gopistol scout_pistol
    alias -gopistol scout_scat

    scout_scat

For soldier I have the same hot-switch as with scout

soldier.cfg:

    echo ""in soldier.cfg""
    exec reset.cfg

    alias +goshotty ""vm2; slot2""
    alias -goshotty ""vm1; slot1""

    bind mouse2 +goshotty

I haven't done anythiing for pyro.cfg.  I've thought about switching to axe or shotgun right after an airblast

pyro.cfg:

    echo ""in pyro.cfg""
    exec reset.cfg

Nothing in demoman.cfg either.  I've been thinking about getting a rapid-fire sticky script since I can't do that very reliably.

demoman.cfg:

    echo ""in demoman.cfg""
    exec reset.cfg

Nothing in heavyweapons.cfg either.

heavyweapons.cfg:

    echo ""in heavyweapons.cfg""
    exec reset.cfg

Here I have the engineer hot-swapping between shotgun and pistol like before.  For slot4 I have to restore right-click to +attack2 because **the engie can rotate his buildings with right-click before he builds them**.

engineer.cfg:

    echo ""in engineer.cfg""
    exec reset.cfg
    
    alias eng_shotgun ""vm1; slot1""
    alias eng_pistol ""vm2; slot2""
    
    bind 1 ""eng_shotgun; bind mouse2 +gopistol""
    bind 2 ""eng_pistol; bind mouse2 +gopistol""
    bind 3 ""vm3; slot3""
    bind 4 ""vm4; slot4; bind mouse2 +attack2""

    bind mouse2 +gopistol

    alias +gopistol eng_pistol
    alias -gopistol eng_shotgun
    
    eng_shotgun

Nothing in medic.cfg.

medic.cfg:

    echo ""in medic.cfg""
    exec reset.cfg

I've heard that reducing mouse sensitivity when you're zoomed makes you a better sniper.  I can't vouch for that myself.

sniper.cfg:

    echo ""in sniper.cfg""
    exec reset.cfg

    zoom_sensitivity_ratio 0.5

When I'm spy I absolutely need viewmodels on because otherwise I get horribly confused about whether I'm cloaked or I have the dead ringer out or other things.  Also

spy.cfg:

    echo ""in spy.cfg""
    exec reset.cfg

    # turn viewmodels on for all 4 slots
    alias vm1 vmon
    alias vm2 vmon
    alias vm3 vmon
    alias vm4 vmon

    cl_autoreload 0
    r_drawviewmodel 1

3. You don't already have a strange scattergun or a shit ton of expensive items
4. Put your steamurl in your post

1335475700.0,su7my,Soldier v Pyro,CuteFluffyBunny,12,2,19,"So I actually figured out how to beat a really good pyro. Here is the technique I use. To any pyros out there

My loadout
-direct hit
-shotgun
-equalizer

Because I am using the DH(I never use the stock rocket launcher anymore), and at a random moment actually fire(preferably after he airblasts). (NOTE: This requires at least decent aim with the direct hit. not high, because he isn't actually really strafing to avoid rockets. The pyro is trying to reflect them back into you). After doing this once or twice, one shot should have landed( assuming decent aim). The pyro is now in the air or the pyro just bounced in the another direction. Whatever the case, a decent pyro will be ready to reflect. If you have good aim, twitch your aim really fast. The pyro should reflect again. Then just hit him again. If you have bad airshot skills, just switch to your shotgun when the pyro is in the air. 

If the pyro starts to just run at you and airblasts you into the air. ONLY fire rockets after airblasts. He may get wise to this, then just finish him off with a good direct hit, and the above techniques. It is important to keep an eye on the pyro's current weapon. If he switches to the axetinguisher, you must quickly switch to the direct hit, or you will die. 

Other general tips
-always make sure you have a spare rocket. When a pyro moves in to axetinguish you he should never be able to if you switch to your direct hit fast enough. 

-If you are good


-remember


-keep an eye on his current weapon. For example

For the stock rocket launcher

One of my favorite things about tf2 is the variety of unique playstyles available due to weapon loadouts

**What's a bleed-scout?** A bleed-scout is a scout who focuses on using weapons which cause bleeding. These weapons are:

* [The Boston Basher](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Boston_Basher)/[Three-Rune Blade](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Three-Rune_Blade) - A melee weapon which (in addition to causing damage on impact) causes your enemy to bleed for 5 seconds. If you miss your enemy
* [The Flying Guillotine](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Flying_Guillotine) - A secondary weapon which is thrown (and will subsequently recharge) which causes damage on impact as well as bleeding.
* [The Wrap Assassin](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Wrap_Assassin) (I don't really like/use this one) - A melee weapon which has a secondary fire to launch a projectile similar to the flying guillotine (except weaker) which causes bleeding. Significantly reduced melee damage.

[Bleeding](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Bleeding), revealing cloaked spies, and of course causing damage.

Note: While it's very much possible to utilize these weapons in addition to your primary

**How do I play bleed-scout?** Beyond using weapons which cause bleeding, I have some tips:

* Hit and Run - one of the best parts about using bleeding weapons is that you can cause damage well after your encounter with the enemy. Use this to your advantage by starting them bleeding and getting out of harms way before they have a chance to attack
* Steal Healthpacks - This is especially useful for the boston basher/three-rune blade as you will often need health yourself. Once somebody is bleeding they will often run to the nearest healthpack
* Focus on Cleanup/Assists - taking on any full health opponent with your bleeding weapons is risky as the bleed damage takes time. Instead get opponents started and either you or a teammate can finish them off later
* Basher Jumps - A more advanced technique

**Why should I play bleed-scout?** I'm going to be honest here, is not the most powerful tactic for winning games. It is on the other hand,  EXTREMELY FUN! It opens up a whole new style of gameplay similar to how playing demoknight is a totally new game from playing regular demoman. Also, it's a great way practice melee battles, arcing projectiles, and alternate map routes.

3. Sign in at the top right and click ""bank keys""

4. You'll be added to a queue at the top of the page. Look for your profile picture as it moves along to the left.

5. When your profile picture is first in the queue

6. Add the two keys you bought to the trading window. The bot should add metal to their window. Make sure everything is correct

7. You now have around eight refined metal! Alt-tab back into tf2 and from the main menu or pause screen

8. Go back to scrap.tf in your browser

9. Select the weapons you want (every two weapons costs one scrap metal) then click finish trade. Wait through the queue again. 

10. Again

11. Repeat steps 8-10. If you want, because 3 weaps and 4 weaps both cost 2 scrap.

$5.00 is more than enough to buy every weapon in the game - I reccomend doing so.

**[EDIT]**
Ok, or for number fans, easiest is 1, hardest is 9. If I mention a droppable item or special tactic, it's name will link to it's wiki page for you to check out.

* **Soldier**: Difficulty Level: 1

Playing Soldier is all about dealing damage. His weapons are menacing at close to mid range

* **Heavy**: Difficulty Level: 2

Playing Heavy is all about keeping the enemies back. He can deal and take lots of damage, or just eat it yourself for a full heal or other handy effects. Medics go great with him.

* **Scout**: Difficulty Level: 3

Playing Scout is all about hit and run. He's so fast, and only his scattergun can deal a lot of damage in one shot. Scout has several uses, such as quickly grabbing intel, capping capture points and pushing payloads twice as fast, and distracting [sentries](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Sentry) with [BONK!](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Bonk!_Atomic_Punch). Don't expect to get a lot of kills as him.

* **Demoman**: Difficulty Level: 4

Playing Demoman either requires patience or accuracy. He is a defensive class, as they can be destroyed by bullets and melee weapons. Accuracy is important with the grenade launcher. On a direct hit, a bomb that hasn't hit anything before an enemy will automatically explode on him, dealing lots of damage. Also, there's Demo-knighting, which changes him into a melee only tank. [Here is a set of weapons based around Demo-knighting.](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/One_Thousand_and_One_Demoknights)

* **Pyro**: Difficulty Level: 5

Playing Pyro is actually a real art. Pyro is restricted to very close range weapons, which, using 20 ammo, expels a burst of air that can rebound rockets, grenades, [Jarate](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Jarate), and more, so avoid Snipers. Also, which takes some practice.

* **Sniper**: Difficulty Level: 6

Yes, so he is best used if you know good sniping spots and locations of health and ammo. Right clicking activates his Sniper Rifles scope, allowing for you to deal headshots, which can one-shot most classes at full charge. By the way, longer time scoped = more charge = more damage if you fire while in that scope. He has a [few](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Sleeper) [other](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Machina) [rifles](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Hitmans_Heatmaker), but he also can get the Huntsman, a bow and arrow that instantly kills on headshots. It allows for him to get much closer to the fight.

* **Medic**: Difficulty Level: **7**

Medic is hard to play, but Medic shouldn't be the one fighting, with some acceptions. Medics are the top priority, and if you are a Medic, just stay alive and build up ubercharge. This may mean you must ditch a group if the situation gets too hairy. If you see an enemy Medic, * **KILL HIM FIRST.** *

* **Engineer**: Difficulty Level: **8**

Engineer requires patience, and a knack for micro-management. He is near useless on his own, but he can build stuff with his PDAs. He has not just health, but metal, which he gets from ammo drops and uses it to build and upgrade his buildings. [Sentries](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Sentry), automated turrets, [Dispencers](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Dispencer), and [entry and exit teleporter nodes](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Teleporter). Buy hitting 4, or 4, (you'll see it in the building GUI and your stuff will stop working) kill the Spy

* **Spy**: Difficulty Level: * **HARDEST** *

Spy is by far the hardest class to play, the most played class by new players. DON'T PLAY SPY UNTIL YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE AS ALL OTHER CLASSES FIRST. YOU WILL NEED TO KNOW HABITS OF ALL OTHER CLASSES TO PLAY SPY. Spy can turn invisible and disguise as other players, including the other team, and kills classes instantly upon a backstab with his knife. Spy's job is to infiltrate the enemy's base and loosen them up for other classes. Good disguises are Demomen and Snipers if used well. Never, I MEAN NEVER, disguise as Heavy, Scout, too slow to be a Scout, cloaking and de-cloaking makes noise, when disguised as the enemy

**TL;DR** The list goes easiest to hardest: Soldier, Demoman, Pyro, Sniper, Medic, Engineer, Spy. Wait before playing your first time as Spy.

Anyway, just let me help you by helping you help us help us all.

Do not buy hats or weapons. The items you receive are dirty(uncraftable) and therefore not worth a lot. Most weapons in there can be bought for 1 scrap each

The only items worth buying from the Mann Co. store are keys(They are worth the most in terms of metal/money) and the Sticky and Rocket Jumpers(They are hard to come by otherwise).

**Weapons**

All weapons that you can find via random drop that haven't been released in the last 3 months or so can be bought for 1 scrap metal each. Newer items are worth more

All craftable hats are worth at least 1 refined. Some are worth more

I know that A LOT of emphasis is placed on the obtainable items in TF2.  Please note that these items ARE NOT UPGRADES.  Too often do I see new players sporting terrible weapons because they are under the illusion that these items are good.  Almost all of them are quirky and take a good understanding of gameplay to use effectively.  

IF YOU WISH TO IMPROVE YOUR OVERALL SKILLS AT THIS GAME- use the vanilla weapons.  These standards are normally the best item anyways (of course some exceptions exist).  OH- and a quick note to all medics- **The quick fix requires a tremendous amount of teamwork, especially on offense. 

Goodluck, you are playing a cartoon game filled with comic relief.  Do not bring your CoD attitude here. ",,False,,t5_2rbtk,False,,

Because there appear to be a decent number of teams interested in this concept

My greatest hope is that the channel can bring in more teams from pubs to the competitive scene. However, and I've talked to couple players that's known throughout the community, hoping to get the word out.

I would like reddit to help as well.
