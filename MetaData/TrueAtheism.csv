And pardon the possible disorganization

For the first 15 years of my life I was Christian girl. When I was a young child

I was very devout. I know what it's like to ""feel God"" or ""Jesus"" or ""the Holy Spirit"". It is a VERY powerful psychological and emotional experience. So much so that attempts to feel it again can lead to irrational, drunkeness, drug use, adultery... Even in my age group. It pushed me further into my corner. Alone with God. I witnessed -- looking from the outside in -- sex destroying some of my peers' sanity and coming very close to ruining a family member's life.

NO ONE ever talked to me about sex. Ever. I think by the time I was in middle school, but I did not go to sites that would properly educate me on this stuff. It didn't interest me.

Then puberty REALLY hit.

It was all very traumatizing to me. I hadn't yet had my first menstrual cycle when my mom gave me what I thought was ""the talk""... and that was to show me what a period does. I was flustered and panicked. I had this notion in my head -- from watching TV and going to church -- that once puberty struck, or doing drugs. I did not want to grow up.

So it happened. I had my period. Hormones started running wild

I also very much disliked the expectation that a Christian woman has to serve her husband. I hated wearing dresses. I hated being called a ""good girl"" whenever I cooked or cleaned (which I adamantly avoided to the point of being punished). I grew to hate playing with dolls because I saw -- after being best friends with a boy during my early years -- how boring it was. Baby dolls? No

Being a ""girl"" (in the Christian gender-role sense) was (and still is) something I never wanted to be.

I never wanted to date. I felt no attraction to anyone of any sex in my real life and when I did

I was confused. Terribly confused and conflicted. I had a fear deep in the pit of my being that I was a lesbian because I found girl-on-girl [softcore] porn appealing. The fear went so deep that I started dreaming about homosexual acts with my female friends. Now, I feared staying around them with those dreams floating in my head would TURN ME GAY.

By high school

Yeah

Keep in mind during all of this time, feeling happy... because I was with a community I thought understood me. Keyword: THOUGHT.

My family left our first church (since moving) when our pastor had been butted out of his position due to inane, but I kept my mouth shut.

At the new church, but couldn't. They had their clique and it was the way they liked it. I was not allowed in even though Christianity is a religion of love and accepting people with open arms. I didn't understand it at all. I would go into the church service depressed and on the verge of tears. I took it out on the weekly pamphlets, drawing dinosaurs, monsters, Jesus riding a roller coaster. Art was pretty much my only way out of feeling completely alone and useless 24/7. And it blossomed. More on that later!

I had my first boyfriend in high school because everyone else around me (that I looked up to) had a significant other. I thought it would fix my problems (whatever I thought those were)... but it didn't. I got bored very quickly of the relationship. And ended it. I still feel a little hatred for myself for ending a relationship with someone because I was bored

SO FAST FORWARD. I was 15 years old (almost 16) when I first and FINALLY figured out how to masturbate (sans penetration). It felt GOOD. Too good. I remember thinking ""THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN MISSING OUT ON?""... but as a God-fearing, as a fucking HUMAN, I did it anyway. And I felt awful, terrible, disgusting, evil after every single time. I couldn't enjoy masturbation. It was like a burden more than a fun activity. I eventually stopped masturbating altogether except for probably once every three months or so...

Then the dreams started again. Sexual trauma likes to manifest itself in interesting ways while asleep. I felt like I was responsible for the things seen in dreams... and sometimes they scared the shit out of me... I had eventually conditioned myself to feel no emotional attachment to masturbation. It was an evil I had to keep in check and I got no enjoyment out of it.

So fast forward some more... first year in college. I got in with a bad crowd because – for once – I found one of the boys in that group of people attractive. I literally thought God was speaking to me through my lust that he was important because I literally feel NO ATTRACTION TO ANYONE except for like 0.000000000001% of the world's population. So I started dating him.

WORST. BOYFRIEND. EVER. He did very little to comfort me in my occasional paralyzing sadness (which I had grown to accept as part of my life) and treated me as an accessory more than a human being. Now

I think now would be a proper place to say that this was not something that was openly, boys play with trains), and how my friends and teachers perpetuated it.

Partway through the school year

Eventually, but it did not work. I couldn't explain to them why, but eventually, I put on a face and pretended I was happy until I was alone in my bed, allowed the privacy to cry myself to sleep once more.

I slept a lot there...

I left that school and went to a community college. I had given up on trying to make new friends, she would dash off to her boyfriend and leave me alone. Great. In hindsight, I think that made me hate sex and relationships a little more.

This is turning into an autobiographical novel, was given medication, took the medication for a year, rekindled my love of art, and went to another college. I dropped my medication and learned how to cope with my crippling sadness. I had lost God and my faith entirely. I never wanted anything to do with Christianity ever again. In fact, I despise Easter and Christmas even as traditional, commercial holidays. Uggh.

ANYWAY, not there, but through OKCupid. By this point in my life (about two years ago), I had grown to accept that I was not a very social person and that being around other people made me anxious and upset. I can't explain it through anything other than experiences and attempts to fight against it leave me feeling suicidal. So the most inviting place was the recesses of the internet...

So BEST BOYFRIEND EVER and I got along just fine... until we took our clothes off. I expressed disdain. I couldn't bring myself to do anything more than oral sex (on him). Any contact on my genitals made me cringe in pain. Even with lube. I broke down crying on several occasions. But Best Boyfriend Ever was patient and we worked slowly. I was incredibly insecure in my lack of sex-drive but he was understanding. Now

Oh sure, WHAT IS THIS. NOTHING IS EVER SUPPOSED TO GO IN HERE. GET IT OUT.” PAAAAAAAIN. Like a sandpaper sausage made of razorblades and dipped in super concentrated lemon juice and salt. Even with a lot of lube. At first I thought it was in my head since I literally couldn't help but think how stupid and gross sex is from all of my previous “experiences” of “witnessing” what it does. I started steeping myself in sex and porn. I'm OKAY WITH IT NOW. But every time I try, my body says NOPE. NUH-UH. NOTHING GOING IN THERE. So... yeah... sure... oral and anal are perfectly fine and easy. No pain. Not even the first time with anal. But vaginal? NO.

I spent my whole life post-puberty thinking putting stuff in my vagina was the grossest thing I could ever do as a human being. I had never used a tampon until I was 21. I cannot physically reach orgasm with penetration from a sex toy.

So yes

I just would like to say

Look, but for fuck's sake, don't do this kind of shit. We exmuslims are fighting against a far more oppresive religion and a far more oppressive religious demographic, so it would be great that you people don't go around downplaying the threat and negative aspects of Islam with shitty ignorant answers like I've mentioned above.

EDIT: It seems about half of you people don't understand what I'm talking about.

Look, I completely undertand that. But the next time somebody brings up a topic of criticism against Islam, be it in a forum or in IRL, don't downplay it by coming into the discussion with 'OH BUT CHRISTIANITY IS THE SAME' or 'OH BUT ALL RELIGIONS ARE THE SAME' or 'OH BUT WHAT ABOUT THE CRUSADES', or some other shit like that. It completely downplays the issue of Islam in a discussion SPECIFICALLY meant to discuss Islam by turning it into a discussion about something else.

Okay, when suddenly Kanye West leaps up on the stage and interrupts her and says 'Imma really happy for you and imma let you finish'. Remember how big of an asshole he was? Don't be like that asshole. When people in a forum bring up criticism of Islam, don't be like fucking Kanye and go 'Imma really happy for you and imma let you finish, but Christianity is totally the same.' Sometimes I wish there was a device that lets me punch assholes like these through the internet.

EDIT: 

For example:

*Person 1:* Have you heard? Islamic Country X is putting people in jail simply for blasphemy!

The **appropriate** answer should be:

*Person 2:* Oh my

The **WRONG FUCKING ANSWER** would be:

*Person 2:* Oh

Notice that the difference between the first reply and the second reply is that the former stays on topic and doesn't divert attention from the issue

EDIT: For fuck's sake, I'm not talking about the socio-political landscape of Islam and Christianity or whatever the you people are thinking. All I'm talking about is simply this:

The next time someone brings up any kind of criticism about Islam, Islam is a terrible religion with very oppressive ideas'? Or would it be 'Oh those poor people, they were killed simply for blasphemy'? Or would it be 'I sure hope the Muslim moderates would stand up and answer for these atrocities'?

ALL of those are fine answers; since they DON'T VEER OFF FROM THE ISSUE. What you SHOULD NOT FUCKING DO is give asshole answers like 'Oh but Christians are killing witches in Africa too', the latter replies not only veers off from the subject at hand, but takes attention away from it or dilute the issue into one generalized blob.

Okay here's another example:

Person 1: Hey did you hear? The Westboro Baptists are going to picket fences around dead gay soldiers tomorrow.

The appropriate answer should be:

Person 2: Holy shit that is horrible! What's up with fundie Christians these days.

The ASSHOLE answer would be:

Person: Yeah

Now, 'OH BUT CHRISTIANITY IS THE SAME' or 'OH BUT THE WESTBORO BAPTISTS ARE HORRIBLE TOO,' or some other asshole reply like that.

I feel conflicted. I understand how religion gets in the way of truth. I see it. Growing up I saw it. It was a very bad thing wrapped in good intention. However, scratched the surface of how it all was created, if it was, or if what I perceive to be  higher power would even claim to have done so. Here's my thing though, I thank ""God"" and appreciate ""God"" I have a personal relationship with this higher power that speaks to me in my head. I feel it in my heart. Its my personal thing. I can't say its there in others and if they are better or worse off if it is or isn't. I just know its there. 

I can't fathom how it looks, if it consist of matter... or whatever... and I just think that's a part of where the problem with religion lies. They take your personal inward battle in this universe, and try to illustrate what it is and who (as if it is a who) when to me no illustration is required. 

So here is my point. We know what we know, the fight isn't against atheism, the fight should be against those that attempt to block a mans search for what drives him. I feel like the cause behind groups can kind of repel individualism but, its those that step out and dare to be different that blaze new paths. I see a lot of ""religion is stupid""... because religion can be. I see a lot of ""atheists are smug""... because atheist can be. Why isn't there more people that realize those generalizations can be made for each group of people? Why can't we as humans admit that we really don't know, but we are going to fight to find out. One way or the other. That's my question whats wrong with that thought process? Or am I trippin? (I'm asking the same thing to those that are religious as well)

I don't mean to offend anybody

But I was made to understand that such religious samplings required no sustained commitment on my part.

Quotes like this and that [speech from 2006](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvKX16Eygs0) he did where he espouses his problems with referring to the bible show me that hes a closet atheist/very agnostic person that is playing the game of political musical chairs.

Don't forget this: http://i.imgur.com/BVt0i.jpg


He ""found"" god @ 26 as a community organizer in Chicago and if you know chicago, without the black vote which comes from black churches. He had to play the game.

Hes one of the smartest presidents, they tried to make fun of him because he went to the best schools in the country? I mean come on as if being a biracial kid raised by a single mother (even though she used to work for the Ford Foundation...LOL) isn't a massive hurdle in life.

Every chance he gets hes always promoting STEM fields and human achievement. Not willy nilly passive goals. 

He rarely says that prayer influences his decisions a-la Bush 1 or 2

When he forgets to pray people blow their lids off and call him unamerican. He left god out of the verbatim recitation of various historical [documents](http://theydontfoolme.com/118/three-years-in-a-row-obama-fails-to-thank-god-at-thanksgiving/) and [speeches](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/25/obama-god-thanksgiving-speech_n_1113295.html) and [9/11](http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/09/11/fox-omits-the-facts-to-politicize-9-11/189827)

Every time he opens his mouth about christianity it sounds [forced as hell](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/21/obama-religious-quotes_n_1292116.html).
I'm not going to go into his politics or anything...but I think to call him a closet atheist, a point verified by many fundie-right wingers; so i'm sure they'd be honest about feeling threatened. He only refers to religion during times of [tragedy](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/02/obama-on-faith-praying-for-egypt-gabby-giffordsand-for-patience-as-malia-goes-to-her-first-dance-wit/), mandatory events like [prayer breakfasts](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/obama-hosts-easter-prayer-breakfast-with-meditation-on-suffering/2012/04/04/gIQAhW7lvS_story.html)...or when hes [trolling the GOP like he recently basically said ""this is what jesus would do,""](http://money.cnn.com/2012/02/02/news/economy/obama_tax_rich_jesus/index.htm) to try and convince them to adopt his politics.

He trolls religion regularly. Its obvious. Why else do you think all the fundies are scared they would lose their privileges under him? [He even campaigned on eliminating faith-based initiatives](http://edition.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/02/05/obama.faith.based/) but after the backlash following his election he was forced to backtrack and reinforce the initiative with a ""faith office"". On top of that

Obama has supported gay-rights [WHOLEHEARTEDLY](http://realclearpolitics.blogs.time.com/2007/12/11/the_obama_questionnaire/

He also campaigned on getting religion out of hiring practices: http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20082217-503544.html

1361981201.0,19bzek,My parent's priest asked me why I was an atheist. Here was my response. Thoughts?,jeffreybaird,788,115,233,"It started with me wanting to be a priest. I admired the work priests did as spiritual guides and general mentors. I had grown up reading about the saints

So I spent some time reading the bible, ""These are the works of men, not of god. The church persevered and all we can do is be better moving forward."" It did, however, make me look a little deeper. How could the teachings of a man who, by my reading, was one of the earliest humanists in recorded history be used to do such violence?

From there I started looking at the biblical justification for Transubstantiation. I found the evidence to be sparse. This, things (Gay marriage, pre-marital sex, priestly celibacy) that I couldn't reconcile with made me realize that I wasn't really catholic.

So, there was some I just couldn't really get my head around. The old testament, of course, gave me pause but I wasn't too worried about that. It was mainly the new testament that wasn't part of the gospels. I realized that it was the attempt to deify Jesus that I was struggling with, especially the works of the apostle Paul. Jesus, by my reading, was more of a Jewish dissenter than a messiah; A great philosopher and not a deity. I felt his message had been lessened by the messianic cult that surrounded him.

So now I was reaching a crisis of sorts. I was no longer a Christian. It took me a long time to admit this out-loud because of the social pressures that exist in our country surrounding religion. I began to call myself a deist. I believed in an active God and a creator. Essentially the god of Christianity without Christ.

Then I began reading the cases for/against God. I read Aquinas' proof for God and found various logical holes. I started to pose various questions to myself. Is it logical for a God to need to be worshiped? Does God help people who pray more than people who don't? If God creates us

Those conclusions led me to believe that if there was a God

This held until I became interested in theoretical and astro physics. After some reading of some various scientists, ""Is there a God?"" This was irrelevant as one can't disprove the existence of an invisible being who has no direct influence on the world. Instead I needed to ask, ""Does there need to be a God for the universe to exist as we know it?"" The overwhelming consensus in the scientific community is no.

So this leads me to my current position. I don't make the claim that God does not exist, the most reasonable conclusion is that God does not exist.

Sorry for the long message but the journey to where I am has been a long one.

&gt; I really was very interested in your journey and how carefully you have read and reflected upon the historical, but there are a number of neurologists who are not so sure and even some who are believers in the reality of something beyond. I wonder if when you were studying you had someone with whom to bounce ideas around. I've found that having people like that challenges me and also makes me accountable. I hope you do.

2. Then I ask them if they believe in Zeus--that he controls the lightening in the sky, and general emphatically or with a bit of mocking/humor. I try to stay very sincere and doe eyed as I ask. 

3. Then I say, to make you believe in Zeus right  here on my porch? Is there anything in the world I could say to you or read to you that would make you believe he is the God of Lightening?""

This is where it gets good. I've had VERY few people try to keep talking and argue. Many ask questions here and there, and that's the only thing that could convince me otherwise. They know they're out of luck with me outside of a ""hail mary"" prayer pass.

But I have had a number of them ask if they can pray to see if God wants to ""show himself"" to me. And you know what

Some do. And they always leave with nothing having happened. Put some--especially high school aged kids--pray with amazing fervency. They really believe that it might happen. And there's something about that kind of faith that I appreciate, very sincerely and in a friendly way, ""and perhaps Zeus will speak to your heart as well.""

1373284107.0,1hux1i,I would love to see a creationist debate a bible scholar.,Rockfiend,538,104,242,"Td;lr:  I want to see a creationist debate a legitimate bible scholar because they speak the same ""language"".

My reasoning:  Okay, the creationist never sees past their own presuppositions.  Sometimes someone like Richard Dawkins will say something that I, being a former creationist, recognize as irrefutable from that perspective.  I'm always a little surprised when the creationist doesn't just say ""That makes so much sense.  What have I been thinking!?!"" and just shake hands and join the ranks of evolutionists.  This never happens.

The last few days I have been analyzing why this is.  I have come to the conclusion that it is because an evolutionist and a creationist speak entirely different languages.  Evolutionists speak in terms of science and creationists speak in terms of the bible.  This is obvious.  Another thing is that evolutionists, but they rarely get called out on it!  I think the solution is to find someone who speaks the same language as a creationist to be able to get through to them.  I think this person is a bible scholar.   If you don’t see why this is possible, hear me out.

When I was a creationist I took a few science classes, it was a perfect book that you could see with your eyes was inspired by god, there were signs of the apocalypse all around that were predicted in the bible (nothing is scarier than that to a creationist).  Fear was ruling me and I didn’t even realize it.  Then, I took two academic bible courses at my university.   Let me tell you, bible scholars know their shit.  In the first week of class they had dismantled everything that could possibly convince someone that the bible is infallible and written by god.  Before the end of the semester, my professor showed beyond a reasonable doubt that all the stories in the bible are folklore (we spent significant time on picking apart the creation stories, Noah’s flood story, all of the prophesies were completely undermined.  The best part was that all of this was done within the context of the bible, I had been shown evidence that there was no way possible that a Judeo-Christian god exists.   When that happened

I have talked to my professors many times and they would tell me stories of all the people that came to them emotional because they realized everything they had been taught in church was wrong.  I also found out that bible scholars can’t stand fundamentalists or creationists or cherry-pickers.  They can dominate on that turf because nothing is subjective to them about the bible—they don’t just sit there with a bible and “feel out” what everything means.  They know about the history

Another thing I’ve noticed is that when I would tell my parents (fundies) about the science I was learning—it either went right over their head or it was immediately dismissed as irrelevant.  When I  started telling them about the stuff I was learning in my bible courses

More and more wannabe fundamentalist Christians everywhere re-phrase the argument that the ""worst mass [murdering]"" leaders in history were atheist and conclude that their bad doings were solely motivated by not having any moral foundations due to the fact that they did not believe in any shenanigans.

In particular, Mao and Pol Pot. Now, while it is true that Communism tried to evade any association with religion, following the original writing of Marx and as a perfectly sane conclusion of the ideology, it is debatable – if not pretty clear that all the communist leaders in the above list did not motivate their horrible acts against humanity under the flag of atheism.

What bothers me the most, whenever I see the likes of Alex Jones and Bill O'Riley use this blatant lie in another pointless discussion about religious fundamentalist views, I keep getting annoyed that no one ever points out that the MERE fact that they keep reciting this false statement subverts their credibility and authority as a spokesperson on national television or radio.

Actually, or even secretly Atheist. Their party program above as well as anything they state can be regarded as empty words to please the public, being populist and serving to the people what they want to be fed.

The **important** matter here is that they actually **used** (or misused) Christianity and **religion** to argue their way through the horrible acts they committed using a mixture of Christianity and Germanic mythology (nordic mythology) as legitimation. (FYI, the Inquisition as they misused Religion for their populist agenda with religious authority.)

How can this lie continue to exist

**TL;DR**: Nazis never stated they were Atheist and actually misused Christianity and Religion to legitimize their horrible actions (NOT atheism). How can we continue allow public figures to keep re-stating the blatantly false statement that the Nazis committed their crimes against humanity under the flag of Atheism and not squash their reputation for being ignorant

Incredibly he could link me to some sources

This started when I made the case that creationism (and specifically young earth creationism) are leading to a mass exodus of young Christians leaving the Christian faith and probably plays a large part in the growth we see in atheism today.

I decided to put this to the test and conducted a short informal poll of /r/atheism

I asked two big questions:

 - If you left the Christian faith

 - What do you consider to be the greatest obstacle to belief in the Christian God?

The results are now in and I maintain that Christian teachings that are in conflict with the findings of modern science are the major reason for the recent growth in atheism amongst young people in the developed world.

The results are available for download in both [xls](http://pastelink.me/dl/f43903) (contains some additional summaries) and [csv](http://pastelink.me/dl/14fb2a) (for those without MS Excel)

*Disclaimer*: This survey did receive a lot of criticism from /r/atheism for not asking the right questions

What I have found to be particularly interesting is the massive disconnect between popular Christian perceptions of the obstacles to belief and what atheists actually have to say about this matter for themselves.

Of particular interest is the large number of Christians (30%) who think this has to do with superficial teaching and not taking the bible seriously enough

Second, you can go on to prove anything.

So far I haven't been able to find a single person who can answer the question.  At the beginning of the conversation they will usually start talking a lot about their beliefs
Several times.  
I'm not sure why that is

Some people aren't sure what I'm asking, minus the effects of air resistance.  That's easily testable.  Drop an object, time it, and do the math.  
If the object were to, or jump out of my hand and fly sideways, that would be an indicator that the theory might be incorrect.  The theory could be FALSIFIED.  If the theory were wrong, anybody could perform a simple test to find out for themselves.

Note that this question only hooks people who are trying to convert you.  When I talked to a religious person who WASN'T trying to convert me

I am completely unable to figure out what to do.


I am the husband and father in a Modern-Orthodox Jewish family. I am fairly certain there is no God, I don't see how anyone could rationally be expected to extrapolate his existence (and certainly not his desires) from anything made available to us.


My next steps are not so clear. There is no element of my life that would not be affected negatively by making it clear (to pretty much anyone beyond my wife and some close friends) that I believe that my family’s world-defining belief is nonsense. The lives of my wife and children will be enormously affected by something like this. Their entire world is constructed around this. Their friends, etc. This world is not a bad world. There are some issues, like treatment of gender roles and sexuality with which my wife and I take issue and we have always made sure my thoughts are known to my children.


My wife basically knows how I feel. She has much closer ties to the community that I have and I’m particularly sensitive to not messing up her life more than I already have (I have multiple chronic illnesses


But was is the cost of continuing to allow my children to believe in a god and Orthodox Judaism in particular? What is my obligation to them? Do I have a right to let them believe in nonsense because it might make their lives easier


I definitely don’t think I should lie to them


There are a lot of benefits to being in an Orthodox community


Overall, but I don’t think that present here in a greater extent than in the population at large. In general, (and certainly the people we consider friends) our contemporaries are thoughtful, generous, and open minded. The secular education they receive is top-notch, and far better than the options available in the public school system. This is in fact an area that is pretty important to my wife and she wants them to stay in a private school.


Anyway, 9, 6) and that it would be cruel to mess up my wife’s life any more.

1362791611.0,19y3x9,My dad is a street preacher. My brother is a street preacher. My sister is a street preacher. I'm an atheist.,Blankstamped,447,82,92,"  So the title lays it out. My entire family preach and try to ""save"" people. I'm an atheist student, and lived in a series of renovated schoolbus...ses? si? I have also lived in barns

So a few days ago, asks if it's alright if he ""doesn't dress up"", and  comments on the way my fiance and I might raise our future children.

I'm very polite.

Today he sends me the little ""definition of atheism"" picture that makes the rounds on /r/Christianity every few weeks. You know- ""nothing happened to nothing and then nothing exploded..."". He says ""I thought this was a good description of Atheism. Love Dad""

So I sent him this:

Atheism is the lack of belief in a deity. There may be other beliefs that follow from that, which means that I don't believe that I can prove that a god doesn't exist, the same way I can't prove that ghosts don't exist.That is the definition of atheism. So, your picture here. I've seen it before and I'll try to keep this short.

First, because no matter where you go in the universe, there is something, because space itself is made up of something. By definition, nothing is something we can't interact with or see or experiment on. Which means that for all intents and purposes, it doesn't exist.

Secondly
""well
""if he has always existed
""If he is 'outside of time' or something of the sort
and ""We have never found any way that any animal or person could exist without a physical body. If you damage the mind, omniscient being would require infinite physical storage space. Where is it?"" 

Whereas ""I don't know."" Is a perfectly reasonable response. I don't have to know how the universe began to know that there are flaws in the creator hypothesis. 

Third, which is the ""life from non-life"" bit, and most of it is over my head. Also, I don't have to be a biologist to realize that ""God did it"" just raises hundreds of new questions, like:

""How did he do it?""
""What processes did he use?""
""How did he turn dirt into a man
""Why did he need a rib to make a woman?""
""If he can make matter appear (and disappear) at will
""How do you know it was your god who made the universe,000 other gods? Sorry, ~27,999,999.""

Fourth

So I've spent a lot of time thinking about this. I've debated it with myself and others, because it's like I'm calling them (and you, I suppose) a liar or an idiot just by saying that I don't believe. I don't mean it that way, and you are neither a liar nor an idiot. I just think you're mistaken. So now that I've over-responded to a little picture, here's a good quotation.

“Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones.”
- Marcus Aurelius

Love you Dad.
~Me

And now my heart is going double time. I feel as if he might disown me. I want to be able to see my family. I want to be able to see my nephews. I probably shouldn't have sent that email.

So... I guess I'm looking for opinions on my email. Was I wrong on anything major?

**UPDATE**: someone asked for a reply
""I just though it was funny, Feeling are allusive and not very good to base ones Life on. The rest seem easy and dry, I'll stick with what I Know and That is The One true God Jesus. Love Dad""

I also have no sense of smell. I have no problem telling people this, poop was bad, dirty, mossy, creek water was bad for my mother but good for my friends, and limburger was….oh crap, it smells bad but tastes good…now what??)

  I remember how I tried to tell my parents and they did not believe me. I remember how relieved I was after picking up the limburger

People still hand things to me and say ‘smell this”…then I give them a look and they say “oh crap

I think that if I could just openly say “I don’t believe there is a god”…. I would feel less resentful about religion. If when people bring up prayers or wax poetic about heaven I didn’t get this sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach that I just do not buy it yet cannot let that be known….. I might be more accepting. I have to nod during discussions
 
It is the implied reasoning that I am defective

I met up with a fellow Redditor in Sydney a few weeks ago on my vacation. We had an awesome time hanging out in the botanical gardens for the afternoon (after I botched an attempt at a motorcycle ride). Religion came up and I was able to just tell him I was an atheist.  He was too. It just wasn’t a big deal

So it isn’t that I hate religion for being religion. I don't resent or think badly of someone else because they believe.  I resent religion for creating an atmosphere where I have to risk my relationships with people I care about in order to be honest about my own beliefs.

- Replace “God” with “Flying Spaghetti Monster” or anything else.

1357676179.0,1679v4,The true cost of religion; the death of my grandmother and how I lost my faith,PixyFreakingSticks,416,74,97,"Three years ago

She was the kind of grandmother that everybody loved, baking cookies and giving hugs and kisses on Christmas.

I loved her. A lot.

My grandfather believes the Bible is the word of God. So did she. They believe the parts that we don't understand (like how could it be fair that children had been starving to death in Africa,"" and grow in God's power, you become a threat.

Those are the people he targets first.

It's all wrapped up in a mystery,"" he said to me once, my eyes going wide at him for cursing in front of me. ""You can't read the Bible and think that it's not. That's why it's so hard. That's where the struggle comes from.""

It made sense, and it never will, no matter how hard you struggle with it. All you can do is have faith and press on. And one day, when ""the old man is put off,"" and we're *really* reborn as true Christians, with a new heart capable of love and a mind capable of seeing the truth, then we'll understand. Because spiritual truths aren't like carnal truths. You can not expect to understand spiritual truths with a carnal mind.

That isn't all he had faith in.

""The works that I do shall you do also, and walked on water. He bent the laws of nature to his whim; to *God's* whim. Jesus eased pain and suffering, and replaced those things with peace and love. That's what Christians were supposed to be doing, according to my grandfather; healing the sick with God's power; causing prosperity with God's power; creating heaven on earth with God's power. It's a beautiful dream, isn't it?

But the power to do this is not given away freely. No, destroy the old way, and be resurrected, born again, a new person in Jesus Christ. This is how you become worthy of wielding the power of God. This is what it means to be ""perfect."" This is what it means to be Christ.

""A noble goal, awesome person to be around. My grandfather is a saint, who just wants to help make the world a brighter place.

That is, together, praying every night, my grandfather first among us. But each day it got worse. Each day she got a little thinner. Each day, her smile got a little smaller. My grandfather's faith deserted him.

""Let me take you to a hospital, after all. Emboldened by his wife's dedication, he relented and agreed, and stayed by her side.

But it kept getting worse.

Soon, more loving, more deserving of a miracle than my grandparents. And yet she was dying. This was a test of our faith, my family decided, like Abraham. So we did nothing but pray as we watched her waste away.

I was so upset that I didn't know what to do, but you could still see the stars. It was quiet and breezy and peaceful. And beautiful.

It was a perfect time for an argument with God.

All I wanted was for things to be normal again. I wanted to see my grandparents laughing together again. I wanted to see my mother and uncle not sick with worry. I wanted my *family* back. So I asked him to remind me that miracles do happen, to be our savior, to give us the power to perform the miracles he did; to win the war between good and evil. Because for the first time in a long time, I wondered if God really cared at all.

""Why is this happening?"" I asked him. ""Why won't you answer me?"" All I wanted was a sign, watching my family, caring about us. A feeling would do. ""Just give the the slightest reason to keep believing in you.""

And that's when it struck me.

I no longer meant ""believe in you"" the way you might believe in yourself, I meant ""believe in you"" as in ""believe that you exist at all."" And that was terrifying. I had never felt such a thing before. My stomach turned in knots, and I felt like I wanted to be sick. I feel on my knees and sobbed, begging God to give me some indication that this was real. Give me, I asked of him, that comfort in knowing that there's a plan, that there's hope, and isn't just an invention of man.

At that moment the wind began to blow. It was soft and warm as it whispered through the trees. The clouds had cleared, surreal, comforting.

""He's speaking to me."" My prayers had been answered! God was *speaking* to me. I knew it! I knew he was there. My grandmother was going to be okay! I begged forgiveness for having doubted my faith, because I had seen the beauty and glory and perfection of God in that brief, surreal moment.

I went to school the next day feeling that the world was a little bit brighter.

When I came home

She had died early that afternoon

They had believed so deeply that God's power would heal her. Everyone in my family did. Everyone had prayed every night. We did all we could

There was no way to explain this. How could I have felt what I felt

For a long time, asking him over and over again what I had done wrong. What had *she* done wrong that he felt the need to take her from us before her time? Was her life really worth taking just to prove a point? Slowly, I began to realize that I wasn't talking to God.

I was talking to myself.

Sometimes, if you are willing to believe important things on bad evidence? Yes, bad things do happen sometimes, but you *probably* won't end up like my grandmother, who believed with all her heart that God would heal her. You *probably* won't end up like my family, who is, to this day

But if you're willing to believe that Christ walked on water

It doesn't. The religious that don't get dragged into something like this are the lucky ones

That is the true cost of religion; the true cost of being unreasonable.

I came out as atheist about a year ago, nothing spiteful).  But the other night the topic came up between me, my mom, and her close friend.  It was all very civil, and I felt like I was doing a pretty good job of explaining where I'm coming from.

Despite being as respectful and clear as I could be, and how she couldn't get by without God.  I said if God helps her, then that is great and I am glad she has that for herself, but she seemed so bothered that I couldn't do the same, and that she pitied people who didn't have God.

So the conversation goes on and I'm still not letting these things get to me, and later asked ""What would you do if your daughter told you she was a prostitute"".  I was absolutely stunned that she was trying to say that me telling my mother was relateable to telling her I was a *prostitute*.  I explained that it was completely different, because the reason I would be upset by my daughter being a prostitute is the risk of STDs, pregnancy, abuse, all of that.  Again, this was dismissed by me not understanding because I wasn't a mother.

I was left frustrated and hurt, bitter, and judgmental people (these are all things that were said about atheists throughout the conversation).  I feel like I shouldn't have had to defend my character because of my beliefs, but I did.  To my own mother and a close friend.  And worse, apparently being atheist breaks a mother's heart the way a life of prostitution could.

So I guess this got very personal, and we didn't leave with any sort of understanding.  Is there any way to get to a point where she, even if she disagrees, can respect my belief and not be ""fine"" with it only because ""there's no way to change [my] mind anyway""?  Maybe the answer is there's not, but that's a hard pill to swallow.

I was born and raised a Mormon. I love my faith

I'm dating an agnostic atheist. And I love him with all my heart (hiya, I'm happy. (OH! btw, we weren't aware of each others beliefs until a while into our relationship.) And until pretty recently, our relationship has been a healthy and joyful one.

However, sexually, than I am willing to go. And this hurts him, because sexual things are very much apart of him. Even though he is supportive of my beliefs, I know he suffers from my restraint. So last week, I told him that I would be willing to go a little farther (making--out with heavy petting). I did this partially because of my wants, but mostly because I felt like he did so much for me, we were talking about it

Then somehow we got onto the topic of how I never express myself, generally about his unhappiness with my beliefs. Which is understandable.

So basically, and my boyfriend happy at the same time.

I find it unlikely that any of you will have an answer to my problem, by all means!


*Thanks everyone!! It means so much to me that you took time to comment


But if you have no answer, advice, anything is welcome/needed/appreciated.

Thanks for hearing me out.


***Going through all the comments. Thanks guys, so I also want to know things from other people who believe the same as my boyfriend. ***

By providing a financial benefit to religious institutions, decided May 4

***A tax exemption is a privilege

***Churches receive special treatment from the IRS beyond what other nonprofits receive***

***A tax break for churches forces all American taxpayers to support religion***

***A tax exemption is a form of subsidy, declared on behalf of a unanimous court in Regan v. Taxation with Representation (1983): ""Both tax exemptions and tax deductibility are a form of subsidy that is administered through the tax system. A tax exemption has much the same effect as a cash grant to the organization of the amount of tax it would have to pay on its income.""

***The tax code makes no distinction between authentic religions and fraudulent startup ""faiths, the IRS warned of an increase in schemes that ""exploit legitimate laws to establish sham one-person, nonprofit religious corporations"" charging $1,000 or more per person to attend ""seminars."" The Church of Scientology, which TIME Magazine described in May 1991 as a ""thriving cult of greed and power"" and ""a hugely profitable global racket,"" was granted federal income tax exemption in Oct. 1993. The New York Times reported that this ""saved the church tens of millions of dollars in taxes."" 

***Churches serve a religious purpose that does not aid the government***, exist primarily for religious worship and instruction, which the US government is constitutionally prevented from performing.

***Exempting churches from taxation costs the government billions of dollars in lost revenue***, PhD, US churches own $300-$500 billion in untaxed property. New York's nonpartisan Independent Budget Office determined in July 2011 that New York City alone loses $627 million in property tax revenue. Lakewood Church, a ""megachurch"" in Houston, TX, earns $75 million in annual untaxed revenue, and the Church of Scientology's annual income exceeds $500 million.

***Despite the 1954 law banning political campaigning by tax-exempt groups, a Christian legal group, organizes ""Pulpit Freedom Sunday,"" encouraging pastors to defy IRS rules by endorsing candidates from the pulpit. More than 500 pastors participated in Oct. 2011, yet none lost their churches' exemption status. In Oct. 2010, Minnesota pastor Brad Brandon of Berean Bible Baptist Church endorsed several Republican candidates and dared the ""liberal media"" to file complaints with the IRS. Brandon later announced on his radio program: ""I'm going to explain to you what happened… Nothing happened.""

***American taxpayers are supporting the extravagant lifestyles of wealthy pastors***, Rolls Royce cars, multimillion-dollar homes, trips to Hawaii and Fiji, and in one case, a $23,000,000 square foot headquarters of Joyce Meyer Ministries in Fenton

***The tax break given to churches restricts their freedom of speech because it deters pastors from speaking out for or against political candidates***. As argued by Rev. Carl Gregg, we shouldn't have to worry about whether we are biting the hand that feeds us because we shouldn't be fed from Caesar/Uncle Sam in the first place."" 

***The ""parsonage exemption"" on ministers' homes makes already-wealthy pastors even richer at taxpayers' expense.*** The average annual salary for senior pastors with congregations of 2, with some earning up to $400,000. In addition to the federal exemption on housing expenses enjoyed by these ministers, they often pay zero dollars in state property tax. Church leaders Creflo and Taffi Dollar of World Changers Church International had three tax-free parsonages: a million-dollar mansion in Atlanta, GA, a two-million-dollar mansion in Fayetteville, GA, leaders of Kenneth Copeland Ministries in Fort Worth

I had, and I spoke at length of the wonder and beauty that I had experienced on the trail.  We exchanged anecdotes for a couple of hours of all of the things that we had seen in our lives that had impacted us in some profound way.  It was abundantly clear to each of us that we had breached the layer of small talk that so often gets tossed around between strangers and were exchanging our actual thoughts and feelings about the human condition.  Neither of us had mentioned a god or religion at all at this point.

After much conversation she asked me if I had ever experienced death in my life.  I had, and how difficult it had been to deal with.  I posed the question back to her, and she explained how she had a husband who had died of accidental suicide.  I had rarely felt so strong an empathetic connection to another and was almost sure that she felt the same.  That's when she asked me if any of the ups or downs in my life had made me feel at all religious.

""I can't say that I am, or watched over me.  I explained my belief on the subject: 

That humans have an ability to abstract the characters of others within your imagination.  That it is possible for me to predict how my brother would react if I asked him to lend me money for instance, and it gets difficult to tell whether the dead are actually speaking to you, or whether your brain is mucking things up because it is this particular type of machine that is prone to conversing with people who aren't there anyway.  I went on to say that while I really think it is a shame, but that there probably isn't an afterlife and I pragmatically don't expect to see or hear from the dead again.

   I could tell that she felt dejected in some way.  She timidly told me that she had heard from her Husband after his death, with no contact information or anything.  She got off the train in the middle of the night in Salt Lake.  

In retrospect I feel like a real dick, but do you guys have any tips for coming off a little lighter and less like an asshole to the kind religious folk of the world?

What follows is basically a transcription of the video linked above. 

This video is going to be a bit different than the other videos I’ve put out since I don’t have an actual argument that I’m putting forward or refuting. I’m going to talk about my deconversion from being a fundamentalist Christian to being an atheist.  And I really want to do this because I think it’s something that all of us who’ve deconverted want to put out there to maybe help other people who may be going through the same thing.  I’m hoping it’s also useful for life long atheists to help understand where the “faithful” are coming from. 

I’m going to give a brief overview of what my religious background was growing up, when I was about 9 years old.  


I was always in Catholic school or Evangelical Christian school up through high school.  I pretty much did the AWANA where you get candy for memorizing bible verses, the whole nine yards.  I had Young Earth Creationist science classes, Sunday school, church service, bible class, bible tests, and then weekly chapel at school.  The point is

Now I don’t want to say this as a condemnation on my parents.  They actually sacrificed quite a bit to send me to Christian schools.  They were almost always a better option than the public schools and even when they weren’t I was begging them to let me go.  So they sacrificed a bit to do that for us and I have no right to complain about my childhood

I went to college and I went to a non-Christian school for college because pretty much engineering programs at Christian colleges generally aren’t all that good.  Now you’d think that this is where a Christian kid goes and loses his faith, and there was a schism in the church I was in and my parents went through a divorce at the time.  So things happened, and I wasn’t going to church, but I still believed.
Now in fact I actually had a renewal of my faith towards the end of my college experience.  So when I got out of college I took my girlfriend who’s now my wife and I converted her to being an Evangelical Christian.  We went looking for a church, I actually had a Muslim professor explain how the big bang and evolution was still compatible with theism in general.  The church we had was very conservative, but they were open minded enough to let that kind of a view in. 

So I got really involved in the church.  I was their “sound guy” for seven years, I worked in various ministries, and in general things were very good.   But there was one left over problem, my circle of friends expanded as a result of my wife and college.  You see back before college, I didn’t know anybody who wasn’t my specific brand of Christian, let alone wasn’t a Christian at all.  Through the course of meeting someone and working with them at a Gamestop while I was in school, and they turned out to be friends with my wife, you’re not supposed to be freaking out about this” and she pointed out that I had no problems with this person before he was gay and that I had no good reason to stop associating with him.  So eventually after my wife and I got married, you were supposed to live and be good

Now something you need to know about my growing up

So I stopped being a bigot

But then there was another problem.  You see, let’s call them Jason and Tom, that after knowing them for 8 years, it was clear they had the same kind of loving relationship that my wife and I had.  They went through the same kind of couple issues, we were just so alike.  Basically, I knew what love was, and it was clear as day that they had it.  

I could not call that wrong.  There is no way you could tell me that love is wrong.  Having a loving relationship is probably the most wonderful thing you could ever experience

This view on their relationship is in direct contradiction with the bible.  And it was about this time that I was going online and debating politics and eventually came across some criticism of religion.  And while normally this is something I’d blow off

The biggest problem I found with the bible was now that I actually had friends that I cared about that this applied to, were going to hell – aka eternal conscious torture.

And that shook me quite a bit. 

As a result all this criticism of religion stuff I read started to stick with me for once.  What didn’t help my faith was that this all came to a head for me while I had taken a temporary work assignment in another country for six months.  During that time I was working so many hours that even though I had my wife with me

I was able to do a lot of reading however

I had no answer for this.  Now one of the things I realized when I asked myself this question was that I was taught this Jesus stuff since I was an infant.  In fact I was taught this by the same people who taught me more concrete things: Ice was frozen water

Ultimately every argument I found for Christianity fell back on “you have to have faith” or if it was a problem with Christianity it was “Well we can’t expect to know god’s reasons because he’s so far beyond us.”  And really that’s not a satisfying answer. 

So I read the arguments, and eventually when I came back home and started talking to my pastor and church friends about these doubts I was having, they really couldn’t get past the first set of counter arguments and things came back down to the whole faith thing. 
The argument that did it for me was the argument from Hell.  This is because if you believe in Christian theology, which apparently he really had to do, then he would have to create a hell. 

 So god is faced with a choice at this point either he creates the universe and create a hell

So why create? If god is the perfect being and before the creation of the universe he exists in a triune godhead of mutual fulfilling love in the most perfect state possible.  He literally is perfection according to Christian theology.  So he had to create for creation’s benefit

But most of creation is better off not being created!  Hell even if it was a small subset of creation that was better off not being created

And that’s pretty much the argument that made me lose my faith. 

One day I eventually broke down and started crying.  I realized I didn’t believe this crap and this was a problem because I converted my wife

It all hit me at once.  My entire family was Christian.  I realized I’m not seeing my dead relatives ever again.  I might get disowned

All that hurt, she wasn’t nearly as conservative as I was and so didn’t see the problems I did since she didn’t have the indoctrination that I had.

So when I showed her things in the bible saying that “No see, etc” she was shaken but she still believed in a god and she was still a Christian.

So I threw myself into apologetics. Hardcore.  For two years.  

Trying to make myself go back and believe this shit again so my life could go back to normal.  I spoke to pastors, CS Lewis, Tim Keller, even more liberal theology stuff by like Kenton Sparks.  I read debate after debate online, reading every possible argument I could get my hands on.  I tried to go back, I really did.  And it didn’t work.
There was no argument that could make me believe that shit again. 

Now fortunately for me everything eventually worked out.  My wife and I had stopped talking about the religion thing after a while, specifically what to do if we had kids. 

That last part was good, which is pretty much the best thing ever. 

We eventually did have to tell the extended family at that point, but it wasn’t a disowning like I thought it might be.  It’s been kind of rough but we’ve mostly been good. 

So that’s pretty much it.  As a result of all this I found out that I kind of like philosophy, you can leave religion.  Life is so much better without cognitive dissonance or thinking that the vast majority of people are going to be suffering eternal conscious torture.  Now I think that there are better reasons than that to leave Christianity, but that’s a topic for future posts/videos. 

Pretty much I wanted to get this out there to let people know my deconversion story and why I’m doing posts and videos.   So if you’ve made it this far through this story,False,,t5_2soy6,False,,,t3_1asyye

There are many reasons why you should not be a Christian, good people – and they’ve probably never thought through exactly how terrible their god would have to be if it existed.

One of the most powerful ways to show this is through the argument from the existence of hell. This argument is powerful because it is an internal critique.  It assumes the truth claims of Christianity for the creation and final destiny of the universe

So let’s start with the argument in a simple syllogism:

* 1.)    God is omnipotent

* 2.)    God chose to create the material universe

* 3.)    Hell is eternal conscious torture

* 4.)    There is no moral justification for the eternal conscious torture of any being

* 5.)    Therefore

The argument becomes even more powerful when you consider the following supporting syllogism

* 1.)    Non-existence is preferable to eternal conscious torture.

* 2.)    If hell was necessary for creation

* 3.)    It would be better for those beings (who will end up in hell) to have never been created.

* 4.)    Therefore, god, or both.

Think about that for a minute

In Christian theology, knowing Satan will arise from that, and a third of the angels will become demons.  He also decides that he will create the material universe and humans, but that humanity will fall and need to be redeemed. And he does all of this so that eventually we can get to a state where all of those who freely choose to love god will live forever in the paradise that is heaven.  Except there will also be those who reject god, and because of god’s justice, those beings must be tortured for eternity in hell.

But if god has this foreknowledge

This means that in order to achieve the goal of the saved and the angels praising him forever in heaven, like a cat or dog that can just live and then die, would be infinitely better than to be created as an angel or human. 

And this is no small group of people either.  The bible explicitly tells us in Matthew 7:13-14 that a majority of humanity will be condemned to hell

Like most normal people

But let’s turn the question back to god.  He has the choice here, knowing that even a portion of it will be infinitely better off never being created, or he can continue on with his perfect existence as a trinity of self-fulfilling love.  What most people don’t realize is that god had the option to not create. In fact, not creating is the most moral choice he could make if he knows that eternal conscious torture for any subset of beings is required if he is to go through with creation.

The issue is that none of us signed up for this, already condemned by default, and if they don’t pick the right religion, willingly, then they’re consigned to eternal conscious torture.  And on top of all that, you’re born into a world where we have all the questions of whether or not god exists, let alone whether or not Christianity is the true religion.

Think of this as some kind of demented game show, but then also allows in a couple thousand other people in there too, all claiming to be his kid and claiming the host has a different favorite color.  Is that any kind of game show you’d be happy to be a part of?

Seriously Christians, let alone hold up as the standard for morality?

The real good news here is that there’s no evidence that god exists, or talk to some modern Rabbi’s, you’ll find that the Jews don’t really have the concept of hell that Christians do, it’s not in their holy books.

None of that however changes the fact that most Christians do believe hell is real

1374569058.0,1ivh0h,I unexpectedly stumped a christian with science.,gamblingman2,463,152,290,"I have family who are... very christian. Very. My father is one of a group of leaders of church (pastors who take turns). My family takes discussions of religion VERY

The wife and I were at my parents for Sunday dinner the other day and dad and I got into a discussion of recent medical advancements. It wasn't going toward religion but I saw a chance to mention something I had read about recently. I casually brought up the development and study to transplant the human brain into a different body. He tried to say that the soul would go to heaven as you cease to exist.

Now normally my dad has an answer to everything. No matter the question there is an answer in the bible as far as he is concerned. If you ask him anything he doesn't just convince you

This time though I had him stumped. He had no answer. What happens if the brain is transplanted into a new body. He tried to say that ""the body is the home of the soul so you would die and your soul would go to heaven....etc..."" but I countered with ""But isn't it our physical mind that accepts god and chooses to have faith in god? That our body doesn't matter because it's just a machine keeping the brain alive. So our soul uses the brain to accept god

He was stumped because it's thought that upon ""death"" the soul leaves the body. But what is death and by the same token what/when is the beginning of life!? If we can remove our brain, then what is god to that ""person""? 

With the bible talking about how your body is a temple of the holy spirit, independently.

Moreover so much of what people accept as belief in god is partly rooted in a bodily sensation, repenting, etc.... But if there is no body to ""feel good"", a lot of what christians think/believe begins to fall apart. Sounds odd doesn't it, but its true.

My eventual arrival into apostasy, in retrospect it wasn't a choice at all. I couldn't ignore the reality of the universe, and this is before I had an academic understanding of astronomy, biology or history. Since then I've heard numerous accounts of how people handle their own apostasy; for some it was liberating, others felt resentful or dejected and some others saw it as a non-issue. To summarise my own sentiments, losing faith made me uncomfortable.

The day I lost my faith, terrified and dragged into it  kicking and screaming. The people and objects were strange and unfamiliar, and I missed my old home where it was dark and comfortable and simple.

I missed the idea of surviving my own death, and it became increasingly vacant upon scrutiny.

I write this because firstly I wanted atheists to know that in all the impossibilities of our existence in a universe of infinite variables, but be with their loved ones. I still having panic attacks at night at the idea of a nothingness, and while I would not say ignorance is bliss, I don't consider it a mercy to deny people of that hope, no matter how futile it may seem. And without condoning nor condemning, I understand why people resist letting go the warmth of faith, even if that warmth is illusory.

As a preface, people panic and get angry at you because you are ruining *their* afterlife. Luckily my wife and I both want out. It's just the rest of our family and neighbors who we fear.

Oh yeah

-----

I go in and out of waves of feeling calm about the church

So

-----

The church has controlled everything in my life. Like

**Birth**

Sure, which are the only records in the world that matter, because everything is a cheap K-Mart knockoff of the One True.

Oh, otherwise my dad wouldn't have been ""worthy"" to bless me.

**Childhood**

The day before my eighth birthday, gone out in a blaze of glory, and still would have made it to the right hand of God in the Celestial Kingdom.

Once I turned eight, and not a ~~white~~ fair and delightsome Nephite. I didn't want to join the bad guys that I had been warned about all my life, so of course I chose to get baptized.

Oh

**Adolescence**

So, then you get baptized. If you want to follow Satan, you don't get baptized. So, I got baptized.

But they hadn't told me all of the rules. They told me about tithing

At 12, and he had to make sure that he was paying tithing to be worthy at each checkpoint to ordain me along the way.

**Mission**

I was the first guy in my ward to go on a mission in about 6 years. People were really excited about it. I felt so fucking great that I was at the tip of a new wave of missionaries in my ward.

And of course, but it is a commandment by The Prophet to go, and you have to remember:

*Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing

*What I the Lord have spoken, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same.

So, because their commandments might as well be his, according to D&amp;C.

So

Oh

**Marriage**

I now had to make sure that I was paying tithing to get married.

Before the 1940's, and then the emphasis became that you got civilly married in the temple and sealed at the same time.

But only if you are an American, and then go get sealed within a standardized time frame.

If you try to do this in America

It used to be that foreigners were to sell their property, because The Big One was right around the corner. Once the Church that Joseph Smith founded (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) got its ass handed to it by the US Government, and was officially dissolved that all changed. Heber Grant started his own spin-off religion called The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (hyphen and lower-case *d*) and Mormonism 2.0 was rolled out. I'm digressing.

**Adulthood**

I have kids now, and I will have several more checkpoints for tithing.

Once you stop believing as an adult

You don't believe, and the two are inseparable.

If you reject the Church, and therefore your wife and children. You don't care about them enough to stick around to make it to the Celestial Kingdom. Your wife has lost her Godhood, and your familial line has been broken.

You are now unworthy to stay married to her

Lucky for me

But now we have another problem - our parents. If we leave the church, the only other option is being a heroin-addicted, drunk-driving, wife-swapping, child-molesting abortionist. 

The man is always the one to blame

Fucking Spiritual Hostage Taking.

**Death**

The church's official policy is that your funeral isn't about *you*.

[Funerals—A Time for Reverence / Boyd K. Packer ](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1988/10/funerals-a-time-for-reverence?lang=eng)

&gt;*Except where burial is prohibited by law

&gt;Funerals held under the direction of the priesthood are Church meetings. They have been likened to sacrament meetings. I quote from a priesthood bulletin:

&gt; - “It is requested that henceforth all funerals conducted under the auspices of the officials of the Church follow the general format of the sacrament meeting with respect to music, as in our Sunday meetings. The closing portion of the funeral likewise should follow our customary pattern of having a final musical number immediately before the concluding prayer. Where feasible, a choir could very well be used on the musical program.

&gt; - “With respect to speaking

&gt; - “Following these suggestions will help to keep our services in line with our established pattern and will avoid practices now so commonly followed elsewhere.” (Priesthood Bulletin

&gt;*If family members do speak, they are under the same obligation to speak with reverence and to teach the principles of the gospel.*

&gt;*Funerals generally bring relatives and friends from distant places. There is the tendency to greet one another joyfully and, showing little regard for others who are waiting to pay their respects. Both the irreverence and the delay are discourtesies from which the spirituality of the occasion suffers.*

So, and Revelator, sustained by 14 million upraised hands. Funerals are church property, and are controlled by church, and you should only speak about the Gospel, and not about the person, and family members should not be happy to see each other or spend time with each other.

-----

So

Just my opinions on Politics, Sexuality, Science, Medicine, Music, Movies, Literature

**Science**

On science, but leadership always denies evolution as being of the devil.

Sure, but the leadership, especially Bruce McConkie, openly denies it.

BYU religion professors

**Medicine**

Priesthood blessings don't work. Stop pretending that they do. People feel that they receive revelations from the Lord that they are supposed to be faithful and only rely on God to heal them from a disease. Stop this.

**Politics**

Cunts like Cleon Skousen write books that mingle the political philosophies of men with scripture

Let's say this. ""Members of the more mainstream conservative movement and the American Security Council snubbed him out of fear that his controversial views would hurt the credibility of the conservative movement."" Cleon was too crazy to join hard-core conservative groups.

**Sex and Sexuality**

I'm running out of steam

The church made me disregard women and hate gays. I don't anymore.

It's been in the works for several years now, something interesting happened. My spiritual beliefs, which I have held since a small child, started to die and wither away. It was rather insidious and I didn't even really notice it at first. I was too busy with school and life to pay it any attention. It was catalyzed by a series of very unfortunate events in the lab I work in. Lots of things failing for very very minor errors. It really sunk in that ""my god, life is really harsh, I can't handle this"". Weeks rolled on by and I realised that ""oh... you know, none of the beleifs I hold can stand the tests of logic, and I could not fulfill it. Uh oh.

*Poof*, and if I was interested I followed. It had much meaning. She's considered ""new age"". She reads tarot, astrology, follows easter philosphy ideas. You get the idea. Ideas like synchroncities, astrology, incidental messages were things I took to heart, read into, were comforting. It allowed me to ""forsee the future""

The thing is, and a discussion I do not care to get into now. It dawned on me, that up to this point in my life, I just have been extremely lucky. Significantly so, to the point where I was so alarmed by it I actually felt sick. I found it to be really disturbing. I wondered how long my luck would keep going, and it wasn't pretty. Some methods of making decisions actually appear to be quite stupid or even dangerous. 

Through a series of rather simple, and therefore holding it will not do any good, and could even cause damage. I couldn't keep my former beliefs even if I wanted to; I can't unthink and forget what I have thought even if I tried.

Now that's all well and good, in my lifelong quest to understand anything I come across, I have found a lot of the ""why"". all that remained was the spiritual, and now that's gone too.

The second, and a chunk of it was spurred by all of this. My beliefs were stabalizing because one particular thought was that suicide would doom you to repeat your life again, in a more difficult manner. Simply put, that's hooey, but it also made me quite fearful of suicide. With that gone, the wall for that isn't exactly there. Luckily I am better at the moment. Mind you, I still have the emotional component (fear) of that that I can't quite shake (several former belief's have this). I found myself not really seeing much of a consequence on my end, there were urges. Luckily no plans.

While I am better now, the future of the world as a whole looks really grim. I went through a very bad depressive episode over exactly this about a year and a half ago when I became ""hyper aware"" of the state of the world, and I managed to back off it. When I am feeling fine, I am feeling fine. However when I start to spiral, many of these thoughts of the world creep in, and it's very hard to dig up the urge to move forward. All because there is no one, no thing, or us. We're totally on our own. If life is just a struggle to suffer and get through

Really though, I am an atheist, and there isn't going back. Logic is logic for a reason. Emotionally, I am kind of there, but not really. My emotions are complex (yay aspergers!), so it's not something that is going to be easily sorted out, and it's sort of clouding the mental logic. I feel like instead of defaulting to an esoteric explination for something, a part of me has not let go

*Somethings still a-miss, is my brain is blocking me from thinking of what's off for my own good. I'm pretty self aware, and I can recognize this. My brain isn't letting me articulate what's off because if I were to, it would cause me to deeply plummet, possibly further than before. The problem is this is starting to cause more emotional blunting, which over time becomes extremely problematic for me in a pretty significant way.*

I talked with my therapist a month ago, that are beyond what we know, and science, and human knowledge simply isnt there yet. She said that I don't need to have such a black and white label. That said, this fits best. I am still trying to intergrate all of this together. I in essnce have burned my foundation to the ground, and am starting over from the ground up. This time, the foundation is atheism, but it might be possible for them to not all be.

Honestly

I will finish by saying I know about the suicide subreddits

**tl;dr** I became atheist because I became aware of what logic actually is, as I am at a point where I really just don't know where I am going.

This discovery, the similarities between Jesus and modern cult leaders is pretty staggering (they're all obsessed with cosmic judgement and promise their followers rewards, are dissatisfied with the state of the world and want to start a revolution, etc).

God, sending from heaven a divine-like figure called the Son of Man in a cataclysmic act of judgment.

Then he found this new age religion called ""Spirit Science"" ( http://thespiritscience.net/spirit/ ).  I've never heard of it until now, positive thinking, mediation and being ""one with the universe"".

There's also some batshit crazy stuff in it too, so they fill them with some pretty far fetched stuff.  It's a mix of the ""God of the Gaps"" style argument, as well as an argument from incredulity.  It seems much more convincing because it uses things we know now, thanks to modern science, and inserts its own brand of myth into the things we don't know yet.  It also borrows many names and events from other religions, so that they can tell you ""Our explanation is consistent with most other religious 'history' so it's more likely to be true!"".

When my friend first shared the video on Facebook, anti-ignorance, pro-science person I am, I took a great deal of time refuting the video, mostly just pointing how misinformed many of the ""facts"" in this video are.

Suddenly, the classic retort is ""It might make you feel good but that doesn't make it true"", but when he told me he was suicidal that made me step back for a minute.  I had no idea he was feeling this way, or that he was even going through the stuff I described in the first paragraph.  Hell, it didn't even dawn on me that he actually believed this stuff -- it seemed way too far fetched for anyone to believe it -- so I thought I would just have some fun debunking a silly video.

Then, he hasn't really changed much.  He's more humble, and at peace with himself, but he's still the same awesome person I remember and he doesn't push it on other people.  Even the website doesn't try to push it on you, it just tells you to watch the videos and make your own decision.  Nothing really wrong with that.

I realized that the most potent forces for atheism are not the arguments we make against religion. No

That is why evolution is so scary to people of all religions. Evolution was never come upon to attack religion. It's a purely scientific theory that only tries to explain the diversity of species and not only succeeds but gives the background or framework to do much more. Modern biology and medicine are unthinkable without evolution.

One of the first things religious apologists will try to do is twist that fact and say that ""evolutionists"" have an agenda. But that's patently false.

Therein lies the strength of science. It's an inquiry that is founded on nothing but pure curiosity that sets out without assuming anything except in the form of hypotheses that might be refuted or refined along the way. But while doing this dispassionate research

That's where we come to what I say in the title. Often, but I feel it happens just too often.

It's time we just boldly affirm our worldview and that we force them to argue from our viewpoint.

P.S.: I know some people will come around and say not all atheists have a scientific perspective on things. Yeah yeah

I wanted to discuss a few things that I've seen said over and over about the new pope see if I can give some insight. Being in a Catholic country people are (mostly) happy about the designation

**1. Sure

Most people in Argentina are white and Italian

**2. He's a homophobe**

No doubt. When the legalization of same sex marriage was passed last year

**3. He won't change anything**

Politically the Church is in big trouble trying to compromise old values and a new world order
Bergoglio has been a life long champion for poverty, but the Church, being one of the richest and most powerful institutions in the world, with great influence over huge amounts of poor people, if it tried, could be a great force in pushing charitable projects, like clean water, and education initiatives. Maybe I'm being optimistic

**4. He cooperated with the Military Dictatorship in the 70's.**

The reports on Bergoglio's activities during the military dictatorship are mixed. His primary detractor is Horacio Verbitsky

While his work is not questionable in and of itself, a Nobel Peace Prize winner for his humanitarian work during the 70s and 80s who was himself a detainee of the Junta has said Bergoglio had NO ties to the dictatorship and even try to free a few of his church members by testifying in their behalf. ([source in spanish, sorry](http://www.infobae.com/notas/700917-Perez-Esquivel-El-Papa-no-tenia-nexos-con-la-dictadura.html)) The main point of discussion here is the fate of two priests who were detained during that time (one was freed, the other died in jail). Some people accuse Bergoglio of turning him in, others say he tried to free them. The church's silent complicity during the 70s is not in doubt, but Bergoglio was very young back then so his influence is less than has been publicized by his opposers.

I personally have not made up my mind about him on this subject but overall, but if they turned their resources to social problems in poor countries I think he'd certainly be better than Ratzinger.

Since work was a poor place to talk about these kind of things in any detail, we agreed to meet up for lunch in three days to talk about the subject.

The next day, or that he had some other emergency that came up. Nevertheless, we met up for lunch, and I learned that after our discussion, he had made the decision to quit his job entirely, without notice, and live a life wholly devoted to ""following christ, and I touched on a lot of topics.

My biggest take away was that the church was basically Circlejerk City. It was a one hour ad for the Church. Keep the faith


I wonder how things would go if there was an actual intellectual debate at church rather than just mental masturbation.


I'm just going to write in point form as I don't have time to make sure my English is perfect.



The Building:

- seemed extravagant and impressive

- had no air conditioning

- looks like it costs a lot to maintain

- the high ceiling certainly does give the illusion that you are there to worship something that is above you



The People:

- all super nice

- kids were playing with each other

- adults were networking and gossiping



The Songs:

- there were a bunch of songs throughout the service...I think they sang 4 or 5 times

- the songs sounded good and weren't THAT offensive

- the whole time

- the guy leading the songs was overly cheerful...so much so that it seemed like fake joy...cheesy



The Offering:

- they talked about giving to the church and holding fundraisers etc

- they did the whole offering thing...which was super awkward...the girl practically shoved the plate into my face

- most people didn't donate...some people placed their money inside an envelope...others gave cheques...one lady gave jewelry



The Scripture:

- OH

- they read verses that were basically circle jerk material (""Jesus is love, etc"".....)

- all the verses were reinforcement type material...very vanilla

- nothing even remotely controversial or intellectual

- one of the pastors actually talked about more controversial topics



The Conclusion:

So my take is that church is basically a marketing tool for religion and like all ads, the church is good, the Bible is perfect, and please give us your money.

Then a few days ago she was going on her second visit and wanted me to come with. I was very sceptical but I thought what the hell. It might make a fun experiment. What I experienced was nothing like what I'd expected.

The priest held a sermon about the golden rule and it was actually very touching and thought provoking. The whole sermon was very secular in nature. Not so much blah blah the glory of god as an intelligent conversation on morality and the plight of the human condition. He talked about how the golden rule exists in almost all religions. How there is no need for complex doctrine and dogma and how silly it is for people to act out in violence over differences in religion. How you need to allow yourself to love and forgive yourself as well as others for their shortcomings, this is a Christian church I'm sitting in after all. But overall, really good! And throughout this church visit it dawned on me that most of the people there, perhaps even the priest, were not really Christians but rather some generic fuzzy blend of deists, agnostics or generic ""theists"" who simply gathered around Christianity because the framework was already there. I think this is how most of the sane religious people work. They don't necessarily buy the specific doctrine, but rather just believe in some kind of undefined spirituality and use the established church as a retreat for a quiet moment of reflection away from the stress of modern day society.

This was a Swedish church of course and I know you Americans out there have it a lot more difficult. But insofar as I'm trying to make some kind of point here (mostly just wanted to share my experience) it is that religion doesn't have to be a poison of pure evil and the secular world might even have a thing or two to learn from religion

What I really want to know is how to support her. Right now she is as militant as any convert to Christianity I’ve ever seen. She talks about it all the time

Background: We ourselves are not religious, some are filled with crazy, just like everything else. The rest of the family on her dad’s side is definitely more religious, and we live in one of the buckles of the Bible belt (Alabama). My side is a bit more relaxed, but we have a few more religious folks around. She met a guy (they’ve been together about a year) who is an atheist, and I’m sure that their discussions solidified her thoughts. 

I accidentally slipped and mentioned to my sister-in-law that they went to Washington to attend the Reason Rally, because he seemed really nice, but how could he be because he didn’t believe in God.

I know my girl’s going to have a hard road ahead of her, I’m not angry and though she is a bit aggravated I won’t come to her way of thinking (this is the biggest issue we’ve ever disagreed on), she’s slowly coming to terms with not having to have her dad and I think the same way she does. Most of the articles I’ve found have dealt with being a Christian parent and how to get your child back into the fold, or an atheist parent losing a child.  But I can’t find anything that seems to fit this situation.

The Messiah is a person who will live up to a series of prophetic expectations and partake of an era marked by particular characteristics. In absence of such being the case

&gt;The whole world will worship the One God of Israel. Isaiah 2:11-17

Currently large swaths humanity do not worship the One God of Israel. 

&gt;Knowledge of God will fill the world. Isaiah 11:9, Jeremiah 31:33, Zechariah 3:9, 8:23, 14:9,16, Ezekiel 38:23

Note that this is *knowledge* of God - not simply unsubstantiated faith in God. Even amongst the faithful

&gt;All Israelites will be returned to their homeland Isaiah 11:12, 36:24, Deuteronomy 30:3

Though there are more Jews today living in the Land of Israel than there have been since the exile began nearly 2

&gt;The Jewish people will experience eternal joy and gladness. Isaiah 51:11

The Jewish people have been historically subject to a great degree of persecution (the Holocaust, etc.) and while generally our condition has improved, we are still a perpetual target. 

&gt;Nations will recognize the wrongs they did to Israel. Isaiah 52:13-53:5

While modern Germany as a nation-state does much to repent of its history (i.e. the Holocaust), white-wash/cover up history, or in some perverse instances even exult in it. 

&gt;The peoples of the world will turn to the Jews for spiritual guidance. Zechariah 8:23

While there is today an emerging interest in observance of the Noahide laws (the Torah's universal laws of man)

&gt;Weapons of war will be destroyed. Ezekiel 39:9

One need only momentarily consider the trillions spent on arms by nations such as the U.S.

&gt;A person’s genealogical/tribal membership are transmitted exclusively through one’s physical father. Numbers 1:18

Jesus whose alleged sketchy genealogy is maternal cannot possibly be a verifiable descendent of the tribe of Judah. 

&gt;The Temple will be rebuilt. Micah 4:1, Malachi 3:4, Zechariah 14:20-21,

The Third Temple is not a metaphor

&gt;World Peace: Isaiah 2:4, Hosea 2:20

The list of ongoing military conflicts is too long to list here. One can hardly pick up a newspaper or hear a news report without being informed of the latest battle, etc. 

&gt;Christianity claims that Jesus ""Fulfilled the law

Deut. 13:2-7 concerns the ""false prophet"" - if one arises who attempts to draw the Jewish people away from Torah observance then he is to be identified as such. The Torah's commandments are an eternally binding covenant with the Jews, that He should repent"" (Num. 23:19)

&gt;All Jews will embrace Torah observance. Ezekiel 37:24, Ezekiel 11:19-20, 36:26-27.

It is fairly obvious that as the situation stands today

&gt; Jesus cannot be a part of God

The idea of the Messiah actually partaking of divinity is anathema to Torah Judaism. God is ONE. His oneness is inviolable and is not that of a compound unity (like twelve eggs make one dozen

&gt; The law is eternal.

Exodus 12:14, 27:21, 28:43, Leviticus 3:17, 7:36, 10:9, 16:29, 16:34, 23:31, 15:15

To summarize ([H. Melakhim Ch. 11](http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1188356/jewish/Chapter-11.htm)): 

*In the future, in his days, the observance of all the statutes will return to their previous state. We will offer sacrifices, observe the Sabbatical and Jubilee years according to all their particulars as described by the Torah...*

*If a king will arise from the House of David who diligently contemplates the Torah and observes its mitzvot as prescribed by the Written Law and the Oral Law as David, and fight the wars of God, we may, with assurance, consider him Moshiah. If he succeeds in the above, builds the Temple in its place, and gathers the dispersed of Israel, motivating all the nations to serve God together

The Messiah will basically be a human religious leader and a warrior king born of a *young woman.* He will **not die and come back, [once he died](http://imgur.com/a/N1kbb) and thus failed to live up to the aforementioned expectations, the Sages effectively shrugged and said ""oh well... he wasn't it."" To borrow a phrase ""The God of the Hebrew Bible sends the messianic king to accomplish his end, not to follow a two-part script in which the hero tragically dies and the words 'to be continued' suddenly appear on the screen.""

We still would have the same issues that anti-theists blame on religion.  Bigotry, pseudoscience, misogyny, disregard for reason, etc. would all still be around without religion.

Sure humankind couldn't use religion for a guise for these blights, nationalism, pure old fashioned racism, etc etc. Most of the things that anti-theists claim as a negative of religion, don't require religion at all.

The problem as I see it

I also think that's why there are people that see /r/atheism as such a hypocritical community.  They see that they participate in the same tribalism as religion does. Perhaps on some level these accusers of hypocrisy realize the real problem as well

My wife has never been very religious. She says she believes in God, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. Even to a not so...jesusy...church. I told her I have no problems with her going, and I won't give her a hard time for doing so. Some people need spiritual guidance, and who am I to discourage that?

I just feel a little guilty for not sticking by her

Was hoping you guys could point me in the right direction.

**tl;dr**: Wife wants me to go to church with her

**Edit:** Guys (and gals presumably), and several people made the point that if she's decided to re-kindle her faith then maybe she's going through something that's causing her to need it.

1354829047.0,14el8n,I was asked if I thought the DNA evidence and human genome disproved the Bible by a Christian friend. This was my response:,PureMath86,262,49,143,"To answer your question from the other day more directly

Genetics has proven the Adam and Eve story to be purely a myth. Without the Adam and Eve story there is no 'Original Sin.' Without 'Original Sin' there is no need for 'Salvation.' Without a need for 'Salvation' there is no need for 'Jesus.' Without 'Jesus' there is no Christianity.

The whole of the religion is built on a story that did not happen. All the evidence contradicts it --100% of the genetics, etc.

This particular narrative, given the evidence, that it is a human construct. It is prone to corruptibility and flaws. But it has a key feature. It satisfies our need to understand the world around us --it provides us with a narrative-- it yields a sense of purpose.

But a more realistic approach is to be scientific

The religious answer is always one of divine revelation --dictation-- fascism. The scientific answer is always one of reason. It may mean that you have to approximate the result before all the information is in --before there is a sufficient amount of evidence collected. But I'd rather be partially right and open to better explanations than to purport a failed hypothesis --one that is demonstrably false.

Ethics is something like this. The ethics of the Old Testament are horrible. The ethics of the New Testament are much better. This is not a testament to our 'creator' or to his divine 'grace, if it does not conform to reason and withstand evidence. For example, the views on women and homosexuals are lacking merit.

So in my personal opinion, I can demonstrate things that are contradictory and would refute the existence of 'particular' deities. Jesus Christ for example is easy to refute with actual evidence (not biblical myths about what the historical figure supposedly said or did). Jehovah is even easier --he does not possess an absolute moral code but the claims are that he does.

So where does this leave us? Well, it leaves us with a responsibility to our fellow man --and in light of the potential and actual horrors of religion --its stifling effect on the use of reason and the accepting of truth, not to mention all the heinous crimes it permits and in many cases commands... it is of dire importance that we combat it.

&gt; Hey

&gt; I wanted to expand on our phone call the other day so you could understand better where my morality comes from.

&gt; I think we hit on an important point when you said that you do good because you love God, such as pirating music.  I don't, though, because I believe that musicians deserve to make money from their labor.  It's not the fear of punishment that keeps me from pirating music, it's my principles based on my understanding of goodness: of what qualities make an action good, and of what qualities make a person good.

&gt; I think Christians are stuck on the horns of dilemma: is God good only because he defines what good is, or does he have a reason for saying that certain things are good?  

&gt; Do you remember that episode of *Friends* where Joey needed money, so of course he did what he set out to accomplish when he invented the game.

&gt; If God arbitrarily defined what ""good"" is, tails you lose!""

&gt; If you want to say ""God is good"" and have it mean anything at all, saying ""God is good"" is not really worship at all: you're just saying ""God acts in accordance with the arbitrary rules he defined.""  You may as well be praising Chandler for following the ""rules"" of Cups.[1]

&gt; This is a dilemma.  You have two choices here.  You can say ""God defines what good is"" and make it meaningless when you say ""God is good"".  We'll call that strategy ""biting the bullet"", and that's the same position I take now: that good is something defined outside and apart from God.  But once you admit that ""good"" is some standard outside of God, then you have to admit that I, an atheist, can strive for that standard without any belief in God.

&gt; If you truly believe that God defines ""good"" by his command, I wouldn't worship him even if I knew he was all-powerful and could send me to hell.  If you actually believe that God can say of any arbitrary act, ""This act is good"", then you're just a step away from some very heinous acts, and that's scary.

&gt; [1] It seems clear that we shouldn't praise Chandler for accomplishing his ends with the game of Cups, who made the rules arbitrarily.  Is it praiseworthy to act in accordance with completely arbitrary rules?  If God flipped a coin to decide the rules of morality, would we really be praiseworthy for following those rules?  I contend that not only is it meaningless to say ""God is good"" if God defines morality, but it's meaningless to say anyone is praiseworthy if God defines morality.",,False,,False,t3_1gs8i8

* A religion may not use the death penalty as a punishment for not joining the religion. It cannot be suggested out loud

* A religion may not use the death penalty as a punishment for leaving the religion. It cannot be suggested out loud

* A religion may not subordinate one gender to another.

* A religion may not ask its members to make oaths or promises without explaining them to the member in full and in writing, where the pledge all of their money, property, possessions, and time to the LDS Church. They have no warning, and upon hearing the oath, they have fewer than 30 seconds to make the choice. They are sworn to secrecy about the oath.

* A religion must pay taxes on the products, then he/she will help you overcome this.

* A religion may not donate money or volunteer labor to any lobbying organization or to any political officials or political actions or legislation.

* A religion may try to explain the origin of the universe and explain the nature of the universe

First off, not the story itself.

My wife has had many chronic health problems - generalized fatigue and pain

A neighbor came to our house one day and told her ""I heard you have some health issues. I know a guy who can help you."" Being a Skeptoid/SWAK fan

She went to the neighbor's home where the ""party"" was. A confidence man came in and started pitching DoTerra Essential Oils. 

The claims were:

* natural

* you can be your own doctor

* Big Pharma is pumping us all full of toxic chemicals

* doctors don't care about helping you

* become a distributor

She walked home with $200 worth of oils, headaches, scratches, coughs, and sneezes with magic oil. She tried pressing our friends and family to join.

I become consumed - I started looking more deeply into Alt Med and Multi-Level-Marketing scams. I came to these conclusions about what they all had in common:

* The product is revival of practice of an old

* All diseases and depression come from a single source (lack of the product)

* All diseases and depression are cured from a single source (the product)

* The product works in a way that is above the laws of nature

* The product cannot be tested or proven the same way evil scientists prove their poison methods

* You will become rich by selling the product to others - all you have to do is believe and keep on pushing

* It is your fault if you don't become rich - you just didn't believe it hard enough

* You need to attend the weekly seminars and attend the potlucks and social events so you can progress

* The business needs to be an integral part of your family

-----

I realized just how abusive and evil Alt Med and MLMs are

I wanted to find a way to take down the companies pushing Alt Med.

In addition to the skepticism I already had against religion, were exactly how religion works today.

Pretty much overnight I went from a skeptic to an anti-theist.

* Religion is its own product.

* All disease and unhappiness comes from lack of religion.

* All disease and unhappiness is cured by religion.

* Religion works in a way that is above the laws of nature

* Religion cannot be tested or proven the same way evil scientists prove things

* You will become rich (in heaven) by selling the product to others - all you have to do is believe and keep on pushing

* It is your fault if you don't become rich or become healed or happy - you just didn't believe it hard enough

* You need to attend the weekly church and attend the potlucks and social events so you can progress

* The religion needs to be an integral part of your family

Religion sells prayer and hope. Religion takes your money and gives you back a product that doesn't work.

*I want to share my discussion with a Catholic priest when he came over to visit us at the house in which I live.  We talked extensively about the interpretation of the bible.  I hope you guys enjoy. Yes

A Catholic priest came to bless the house in which I live yesterday and we had a very interesting conversation, I can't really object. Nevertheless, this visit from the priest has expanded my knowledge about his religion. I apologize in advanced if this gets long, but I really want to share my experience and hope that someone finds this interesting and/or worthwhile.

The priest arrived and my mom called me from my room to come greet him. I did and we just sat there and talked about music and sports for a while. He is a very nice guy over all. Then my mom broke the ice by telling him that I am an atheist and that I don't believe god exists. I know the Catholic religion does accept evolution as a fact, or something like that. My mom was pretty much speechless. Basically, after presenting the evidence and telling her that the pope John Paul II accepted evolution, she did not believe me, but after the priest told her that they do, she immediately changed her mind. They have so much power over people, eh! After that

We talked about many different topics that in a way helped me understand what they believe and why, grandpa, and uncle, just so you know. I told him that it worries me that people in his church do not understand the bible and that they use it as a tool of hate as it is to condemn homosexuals. To that he said that the church offers various bible study groups to which sadly only about seven people show up. He also said that having a homosexual tendency is not sinful, but the actual sexual act is. To which I kinda just let go because it is simply worth talking about since my family quite homophobic and kinda thinks I'm gay because I defend gay rights. I am not gay by the way. This talk was mainly aimed, from my part, to help my mom understand her own religion better because she lacks a lot of knowledge about it. I started to list several things that obviously did not happen such as Noah's Ark and Adam and Eve. I really can't remember what he said the meaning of Noah's Ark was

We moved on to the topic of hell. I asked him if there was an unpardonable sin. He said that it is the sin against the holy spirit, feeds the hungry, clothes the nude, etc. but denied salvation would go to heaven if it were to exist. To that he said no and said that only those who want to be saved will be saved. I said that sure, that made sense, but that I just found it incredibly twisted that a mass murderer who had a deathbed conversion could be happy after death, if the afterlife existed, an individual who could never kill a person and who tries to be helpful to other people would burn and suffer in hell for eternity and to that he said that hell has no fire. Hell has no fire??? Well, rapists

Another thing about evolution I asked was that if Catholics accept evolution, but that Jesus came as a man, so he obviously looks like one of us.

After I learned about these new interpretations, talking snake, etc. if they are not true. He said it is not lying, but that it is to introduce them and prepare them to learn the real stuff when they are ready. I was actually talking on the phone with my aunt this morning and I was telling her about this. She still believed that Noah's Ark, Adam and Eve, and that we were literally created the way god looks. She was so confused about all I told her, that she even asked if he was a real Catholic priest and not an impostor hahaha! She said that that was what she grew up with and was told by adults to believe. That goes to show that most people are very ignorant of their own religion and they keep teaching children things they know nothing about

So, and all my friends and family would be sucked up to heaven and I would be left on earth alone with nothing to think about but my own eternal impending doom in hell.  I believed so fervently in the pain and torture and torment and eternal nature of hell that this thought absolutely terrified my down to the deepest recesses of my bone marrow.  Once when my parents didn't come home from an errand (they were an hour or two later than their estimate) I actually went out in the yard and wailed and screamed at the top of my lungs and pleaded with God to please give me a second chance and don't send me to hell.  My parents got a call from my neighbors about my insane actions and rushed home to see what was the matter.  I didn't know how to explain.  This is just one of countless examples.  In fact when I lived near an airport for a year, every time a plane would fly over and I would hear it before I saw it I would think it must be the sky being ripped apart by king Jesus and all his trumpet-playing angel friends.  It is so ridiculous to recall now, but keep in mind this ended before I was 12.  Did anyone else have anything like a similar experience?

I was in a military classroom and the subject of military history came up.  I mentioned that an Air Force captain in the 60s had flown in a weather balloon, but I saw it on a History Channel special.  The teacher called me out, saying he was on a team of weather scientists long ago and he knew the fastest a body can fall is terminal velocity, around 120 mph.  I countered that terminal velocity at low altitude was different than high altitude because of drag.  A body could accelerate first and then decelerate to terminal velocity.  I even used the whiteboard to diagram the thin/thick atmosphere.  He scoffed and said I didn't have his experience or knowledge and I was flat wrong.  He got the rest of the class in on the scoffing.  I stuck to my guns, even though a friend whispered that I was probably wrong and should shut up.

For weeks I was chided by my classmates and other teachers heard about the encounter.  When I tried to enter conversations

1362042964.0,19dzqf,Why calling myself an agnostic about God no longer makes sense to me.,DaystarEld,231,37,122,"I've come to believe calling oneself an agnostic about God is

In the past 25 years I went from Jewish to Monotheistic to Deistic to Agnostic to Atheist

Why? A number of reasons. I like the idea of a sentient Higher Power looking out for humanity, the richness and variety of our life so wide, that surely some Celestial Spark must have been placed in one of our ancestors sometimes in the past 10,000 years or so.

But while I can't help occasionally feeling those things, no matter how much I look and read and listen and debate.

Atheism is a ""dirty word"" in much of US society, we who left the fold must loosely label ourselves by the absence of a belief.

So why can't I call myself an agnostic anymore? It's nice and safe and inoffensive

Well here's the thing. Most agnostics say that their belief that God may exist boils down to a) the lack of evidence He doesn't exist, and therefor outside the purview of science or reason.

**The problem is

Do I believe in magic? Primal spirits, and am still open to the idea that they might exist.

But do I call myself an agnostic on those things? If someone asks me if they're true

Most likely, but until evidence shows up I disbelieve.

This is exactly what the vast majority of atheists say about God.

To claim that ""asserting with 100% surety that there is no God is just as arrogant as claiming with 100% certainty that there is"" is a strawman itself. The vast majority of atheists, or 9.7/10, or some such.

Acknowledging two things is important here:

1) It's as impossible to pretend to disbelieve something you believe as it is to pretend to believe something you disbelieve. Meaning you can't just through a matter of willpower believe you are a mosquito: on some level

2) It's impossible to prove an unverifiable negative. I know this comes up a lot

But due to the ""Prove a Negative"" fallacy inherent in the argument of agnosticism, leprechauns, ghosts, etc. Which is why ""agnostic deist"" or ""gnostic atheist"" are actual things, much more precise than the shorthand many use.

And while some people may well admit being agnostic on all of those things, but on the issue of God they are agnostic. Which leaves God as a double-standard born of societal pressures, because we've been conditioned to treat religious beliefs differently.

Final points:

I know rain is the result of precipitation. Can it be more than that? Are there undetectable rain spirits also affecting whether rain falls? Not likely

Being open minded means being open to the **possibility**, I don't think so, because there's no evidence or logic to support it. That doesn't mean I think they can't exist. Why should it be different for God?

In summation, just as we are born a-astrologists. But we live in a time and place where it's deviant to disbelieve in one of those things, but not the other, on purely inconsistent rationale.  And so, many people consider themselves agnostics, despite having just as little reason to believe in God as anything else they have no evidence of.

**TL;DR**: Under what criteria does a rational acknowledgement of lacking evidence support an unsupported theory?

Why should the perfectly reasonable ""I don't know what the truth is

Edits:

Thanks for all the responses. Two things I wanted to clarify:

1: Thanks to Wintershine for pointing out I misstated the point about disproving a negative.

2: I am aware of the ""agnostic as adjective"" spectrum of belief.  While technically correct, including evade any and all scrutiny by puny mortals, just isn't thinking clearly.  So I consider almost everyone agnostic, even those who believe God exists with 100% purity, because they will quickly say ""Oh, well science can't prove He exists,"" which means ""nothing can"" as far as I'm concerned.  So I use ""agnostic"" as a noun, to identify their belief on God as being unsure/undecided.",t5_2soy6,True

What really bothered me though is two teenagers (probably 16) came by clutching their Bibles, holding out a flier.  I said ""thank you, but no thanks"".  He shoved the flier into my hand, would not take it back and tried to tell me about how he is certain where he is going after he dies.  Didn't I want that as well?

I had no interest in debating anyone this weekend.  This kid however (the girl with him was silent the whole time) did not want to leave like the others eventually did.  In order to get the message across that we were not interested (my husband and friend were busy with other customers) I told them very politely but firmly that they may want to save their flier for someone else.

I told my wife last night that I was losing my faith.  She seems fine with it with one caveat.  She told me last night ""You know I don't want you teaching our children there is no god right?""

I told her ""I want to teach our children to seek their own answers.""  This one exchange scared me.  I'm of the opinion for a marriage to work the people in it must agree on the big issues (money

I feel more free now that I know there is no man in the sky watching me and no hell to be afraid of.  What bothers me is that I don't want my son to be taught from a young age all of the ""fear tactics"" that are used to indoctrinate children into belief.  I want him to choose religion when he's mature enough to do so if that what he wants without the guilt and fear that kept me believing for so long.

Are there any folks here who are in a similar situation?  One of you are non-believers and the other is.  How do you reach a compromise with two fundamentally different opinions?

1366038236.0,1ce4im,Psychoanalysis and the denial of death as a way of looking at religion and its root causes,JohnBloggs,210,34,68,"Ernest Becker is the author of The Denial of Death

I will go on to summarize some of the concepts behind The Denial of Death but I highly recommend you go on and read the aforementioned books. This sort of argument is something which I have yet to see thoroughly discussed on any of the atheists boards I have ever went through. If there have been similar conversations here on reddit I'd highly appreciate it if you could point them out to me.

The idea put forward is that people are terrified of death and that if we were to be consciously aware of our inevitable demise during every second of our lives we wouldn't be able to function. To make sure that our inevitable ending does not creep up into our day to day consciousness we develop repression mechanisms.

The main repression mechanism is what could be called a ""hero complex"". We develop the idea that we don't actually die but continue to live through our work

This helps to explain for example why people are willing to engage in the most horrible of jobs or in any other kind of situation which when looked at from outside seems outrageous, the healthy, and the paraplegic can be happy.  It is when the repression mechanisms fail that both the rich and poor either go insane or fall into depression.

What this sort of death denial also helps to explain, submit themselves to a fatherly god, and fantasize about heaven and hell. The idea of being part of a greater plan, of having an intelligent creator, of having an eternal life beyond the physical one is absolutely perfect in repressing the thought that we are mere physical creatures who ultimately have to die. It's the ultimate hero complex. I think that if we look at religion from this perspective it becomes a bit more digestible or easy to understand. It offers a view which I believe expands beyond the old intelligent design vs science or creationism vs evolution arguments.

Although it may seem to be a weak argument in that the creationist may turn it around and say, if it works so well in repressing those thoughts and making me happy, then why should I ever give it up?"", I believe that it actually is a stronger argument for the irrationality of religion than even that put forward by the scientific method in that it clearly describes the core of any religion as being nothing more than an archaic reptilian repression mechanism. As modern people we don't have to rely on it to find meaning in our lives or to not be terrified at the idea of death. As modern people we can free ourselves from this reptilian thinking and embrace life, appreciate its limited quantity, find much more meaning in those around us, in our actions

I remember a presentation by Neil deGrasse Tyson in which he was presenting a chart showing how even among the top scientists there is still a small percentage of people who believe in some kind of personal god. He was then wondering whether scientific literacy and reason can simply do no more than that and whether the religious statistics are bound to always asymptotically approach a number which is still higher than zero. My view is that scientific literacy and reasonable thought can indeed only take us so far. It's necessary to understand the deeper psychological issues which lay at the base of religion if we are to ever move beyond that asymptotic limit and reach the zero level on the religiousness chart. It's not the scientific method which religious people have a hard time accepting. It's the psychological constrains which they have hard time giving up.",,t5_2soy6,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/1ce4im/psychoanalysis_and_the_denial_of_death_as_a_way/

So I've seen a few posts on people sharing their experiences being Atheists in non-Western countries so I thought you might be interested in mine. I'll start my personal (hopefully not too long) story and then move on to the state of the country. Please don't hesitate to ask any question you want.

I was raised Catholic like a lot of middle class people around here. Went to Catholic school


I became an Atheist when I was 16. Weirdly enough

When I ""came out"" to my mom, she realized I was serious. It didn't make much difference to my dad who's an atheist too. For most of my family, it didn't make much difference, some were shocked.

My school took it badly. *really badly*. I was basically shunned from Catholic classes (like Sunday school but during the week), kind of enjoyed it.

My grandparents still have no idea. They think I'm simply a non-practicing believer. I'm 22 now. I hesitated for a long time but it'd seriously do more harm than good.

At my university (American University of Beirut)
Most people around me were religious (all moderates

On a national level

I even talked with 3 Hezbollah members a few weeks ago about this very subject. 2 of them were really understanding and even interested but the 3rd one kept on staring at me suspiciously. But my worst experience was by far with the Phalange (far-right wing Christians) who treated me like a traitor (because I'm still *supposed* to be a Christian).
So I'd say our problem here is mostly political instead of just religious. Unfortunately

In this post I'll elucidate important definitions and distinctions to be made in regards to specific labels

**theism v. *a*-theism:** 

* theism - the belief in the existence of a god or gods; specifically: belief in the existence of one God viewed as the creative source of the human race and the world who transcends yet is immanent in the world.

* atheism - the disbelief or lack of belief in the existence of God

* Colloquially, both of which I will discuss later on).

**gnostic v. *a*-gnostic:**

* gnostic - the possession of knowledge

* agnostic - the lack of possession of knowledge

* Colloquially, or gods (I discuss issues with this use later).

**anti-theism:**

* A stance in direct opposition to theism; an active opposition towards organized religion or the belief in any deity; *or* in a more nuanced context it refers to the active opposition of belief in a *specific* deity or deities. [[1]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antitheism)

* Most often, it does not have the same meaning and makes several important distinctions, namely the active opposition of theism.

**miscellaneous:**

* strong v. weak atheism - strong and weak atheism are the more nuanced positions one can hold on the existence God, whereas a weak atheist simply lacks belief. This is different from gnostic/agnostic as both of these claims can be made with or without claims about the possession or potential of knowledge.

* implicit v. explicit atheism - implicit atheism is the absence of theistic belief without the conscious rejection of it, they do have important distinctions. Implicit atheism is applied to those who ""[are] unacquainted with theism [...] [and therefore] do not believe in a god."" Implicit atheism also extends to young children incapable of grasping the complex notion of God, a god, or gods. It should be clear then that those who have been introduced to theistic claims would be categorized as explicit atheists. [[2]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_and_explicit_atheism)

* ignosticism/igtheism/theological noncognitivism - the stance that all other theistic stances (theism, et cetera) make too many assumptions about definitions and concepts of God, a god, or gods. Generally, ignosticism takes the approach that a coherent definition of God must be presented before the question of the existence of God can be meaningfully discussed. Furthermore, if that definition is unfalsifiable, the ignostic takes the theological noncognitivist position that the question of the existence of God (per that definition) is meaningless. In this case

* apatheism - the stance of acting with apathy or a lack of interest regarding the concept or existence of God, a god, or gods is neither meaningful nor relevant. [[4]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatheism)

* post-theism - the stance that proposes to have not so much rejected theism as rendered it obsolete

* pantheism - the belief that everything composes an all-encompassing

* deism - the belief in the existence of God, a god or gods that created the Universe and then ceased to interfere with it.

**Correct Uses:**

* gnostic v. agnostic atheism - *gnostic* atheism is the stance that God, and that this is, for all intents and purposes, determinable.  *agnostic* atheism is the disbelief in the existence of God, a god, or gods, and that this is one of two options: either fundamentally indeterminable (i.e. that one cannot *ever* come to a confident conclusion), a god, while strong/weak denotes a belief in the nonexistence v. a disbelief in the existence of God, and thus the labels gnostic and agnostic can be correctly applied in the same way)

* [This](http://i.imgur.com/WMV2Dib.jpg) image is useful for visualizing the spectrum of theism/atheism and gnosticism/agnosticism.

* Independent usage of the term agnostic - while colloquially the term agnostic can be used to describe, a god, or gods, this usage is fundamentally flawed.  Either a person has a belief or lack of belief in the existence of God, a god, or gods; i.e. a person lives their life one of three ways: one, said person believes in God, or gods, or gods, as an apatheist

* Mix and match! - many of these terms can be applied simultaneously to a single individual while remaining logically consistent.  Really

I hope this post has been helpful in alleviating any confusion we might have in the community. Also

Let me tell something about myself first. (this is a throwaway account and I will try to leave about real details since my girlfriend and friends reddit)

I am a twenty-something year old who was born and raised as a Christian (Reformed).
Although I have been attending church every Sundays of my life, suppressed my beliefs or at least express my beliefs openly. Another reason is that I love science and philosophy. I have debates with my friends about life and reality all the time and this often gets in the way of my belief.
I had my ups and downs with religion. But when I went into university

**I am a Christian who WANTS to believe**

I like going to church. I attend an immigrant church so this is the only time that I get to meet people from my country. Also

That was just about me. I have a girlfriend who I have been dating for over two years now. She is an atheist. This is not a problem for me at all since everyone else I know are atheists here. She understands that I have a faith (or that I wish to)

The problem is

This is not an isolated incident with my girlfriend. I get this with other people also. As soon as I tell them I am a Christian

When I try to tell them that my religion is not like that and explain

Upon reading the r/atheism, highly skewed and prejudiced.


It's difficult and uncomfortable at times.
Is there any way for me to change that. Or maybe get them to see religion under a different light.
My current strategy is to be just ""good"". The whole point of being a Christian is to project Jesus's image in us. I feel that if they see Christians negatively

So if

I am a Jain.

Women during period are viewed as impure and essentially treated as untouchables. For 3 days, eat alone, sleep alone, etc.

I have repeatedly questioned my parents to justify this practice. Initially

I expected that the reasoning for that might have been something along these lines - The practice was started quite a time back

On questioning this to many people who follow and expect their children to do so

1) Periods result in impurity flowing about of a women's body and kills lots of micro-organisms in the process. 
2) There is a lot of negativity associated with a women during her period.

Here's what's going on in my country right now (apart from the protests): the ""gay cure"" is one step away from being legalized. Our ""Human Rights Committee"" approved this project. Why? Because there's a majority of people from religious parties in there - including the head of the committee

This is not just about homosexuals being discriminated. This is a precedent. Those religious parties, and right now we are vulnerable because of the protests. Don't get me wrong, I'd be outside protesting right now if I were in a major city – the local protest is in a few days. Still, this makes us vulnerable. It should make us stronger, but the middle class is the one protesting. The ""lower"" classes are easy to scare. They are way too ignorant and willing to trust these religious political parties. In every poor area of every city you won't find anything more varied and numerous than ""temples"" – mostly evangelical. They're basically at home in those places. There is where they seek refuge from their misery and fear. And right now they are afraid – not scared for their lives, but afraid that nothing will change. And they will turn to the religious parties for solace. If our military steps in, there will be new elections. And if that happens

There are more reasons for me to be saying that the religious political parties are gaining momentum. We have been struggling with a proposition that will grant the unborn rights regardless of whether they are wanted. It's about abortion, but that change required huge push. Also, this proposition still establishes that the law should give the unborn every right a citizen would get from the moment of conception – which is fine, if abortion were legal and the country weren't full of religious nut-jobs just waiting for a chance to convict someone who had an abortion of qualified murder. 

Here is my dilemma. I don't want to be disrespectful. I know way too many religious people who are not disrespectful of my atheism, still prone to support some very questionable propositions because of their religiousness. They still feel like being gay is unnatural, that abortion is hideous, that someday atheists will understand ""the truth"". Here is where Democracy clearly fails reason. And I am one step away from defenestrating every little bit of respect in favour of a reasonable government. That's why I feel like I really need advice right now.

I hope I'm in the right place for this.

**Thesis**: Religion is essentially a disease of the mind


**Contention 1**: Being religious is not a choice. It is usually treated as being a choice, your brain must accept that faith-based claims are legitimate. If your brain doesn't work that way, you can't have faith. If it does work that way, you can't understand why not to hold those beliefs and will keep the religion to go to heaven and avoid hell or whatever else the religion promises. 

Thus, is an involuntary property of the brain. It is psychological, but it is still a material condition. 

**Contention 2**: The condition of religion is not inherent to the mind, which can allow the contagion to spread just a quickly. Faith-claims are transmitted to people's brains like an infection to the body. The function to discern logic from illogic filters and attacks them like antibodies attack pathogens. Children, the weak minded, and others with undeveloped or compromised logical faculties, are the most susceptible, just as children and others with weak immune systems are most vulnerable to disease. 

The religion evolves through natural selection just as a disease does. The species with the greatest ability to propagate itself survives and others die. Thus the religion develops many of the same features as diseases

**Contention 3**: A religious brain is not working properly

**Conclusion/TL;DR**: Religion is a material property of the brain, and makes you sick. In this way it is identical to biological diseases, and should be treated as such. From this perspective, it is truly the greatest disease ever known, an epidemic on an unprecedented scale. Children should be protected from it just as they would be kept from sick people. Logic-therapy treatment should be employed to cure religious people of their illness. Allowing them to remain ill threatens everyone around them, especially their children. People with contagious diseases are not safe parents.

----------------------------------

I hope that isn't too extreme to be given fair consideration. Please commence criticism.

Edit: Thanks for all the great responses everyone. As people have pointed out most of my argument either fails to differentiate the ""disease of the mind"" from a simple meme or is a subjective opinion. Hypothesis rejected.

A little background. I play drums freelance around the Bay Area and I have a steady church gig that I've had for about 3-4 years now. I play there pretty much every other Sunday in alternation with another drummer. When I first got the gig

Here's the problem. They have never asked me about my beliefs(I assume they assume I am christian), some other things like that but they are few and far between. They pretty much just leave me alone and let me do my thing. However, something happened recently that I'm a little concerned about. 

In our weekly email regarding logistics

""I keep forgetting to ask you to sign the statement of faith.  Forms are on the table in the choir room.  Every year (Church name) asks each volunteer to sign and turn in the statement of faith…it’s always good to go back to the basics every once in a while.""

It's been about a month since I got this email and nothing has been said to me in person. I don't know what I should do really. Just sign the thing, and I would love to not play at the church ever again, but I really do need the money, and the practice helps. 

Any advice or discussion will be greatly appreciated. If anyone has any more questions that can help clarify the situation for you

EDIT:Removed church name. Thanks bud!

Being an atheist I have friends from various religious and non-religious backgrounds and some of my closest friends are (were) Christians. Religion has almost never been an issue in those relationships. Maybe except with this one girl with whom we had very strong disagreements about pre-marital sex. Anyway

The problem I have is with my oldest friend. We met in secondary school and have been very close friends for 15 years. She and her whole family became Christian about ten years ago when her father who had problems with drug abuse ""accepted Christ"" and was able to quit the drugs. When we meet we almost never talk about religion

 We used to spend nights awake watching movies, a couple of days ago she sent me a message saying that she is very sorry but god wants her to stop meeting me altogether. At least for a while - sort of give me up for a lent. 

She actually said that she has met god in person and he wants this for her. The thing is that she believes this with all her heart. What I believe is that she has severe psychological problems. 

Now the problem is - what do I do about this? Do I give her time and space or do I try to talk her out of this? I really

Also




UPDATE: Thank you all for your opinions. They really helped me to take a step back and look at this situation from a different perspective. Oh

What I did was write to my friend and try and explain how I feel about her decision. I said that although I don't understand what is making her do this

She answered my letter and said she is thankful that I at least am trying to understand. In her letter she mentions that she had prayed for a true friend and that god had given her me. I guess, of course, she ended with ""I will pray that one day you meet god"". This was one thing that I really liked about her - she would never tell people, she was going to pray for them. Also, there was no explanation on how exactly she met god - just said it's not something one can explain.

Additional background that I failed to mention before - her dad died about a year ago from AIDS. As we are both 27, so they are very close. 

So, I don't believe I deserve to be treated like this, I still hope she comes to her senses. Anyway, thanks again - you all were awesome, taking your time to help me! ",,False,t5_2soy6,True

1342986511.0,wz84u,Why I think atheists who like Buddhism are wrong,,222,82,156,"So it seems like many atheists are into Buddhism.  And I don't get it.  My arguments follows.

1.	Suffering is not inherently bad.  The incorrect assumption on which Buddhism rests is that all suffering is a negative experience.  I do not agree.  Suffering can make us stronger and better people.  I think Frankl comes much closer to the proper mark when he says that a man is defined by his reaction to unavoidable suffering.  It is not necessarily something that should be sought out, and I am suffering in the moment.  I’m in pain, and don’t really like what I’m doing, but I do it, knowing it will make me better, stronger, and faster tomorrow.  I think the same can be said, for mental/emotional/psychological suffering.  South Park has a great episode where Butters explains that in a way, without being offset by some occasional suffering, rendered entirely void.  The ability to feel such emotions

2.	Desire is the primary human motivator.  I desire food, I think the world would be in a much poorer state; we never would have got past living in caves, gathering whatever sorry foodstuffs we could find.  As secularists/humanists/whatever-ists, we should have the desire to help our fellow creatures.  I feel that not doing so, simply out of concern for our own suffering, is an actively immoral act.  

There are some tenets with which I agree; namely, but I’ve read a few books on the topic, and done a good deal of internet research.  This is the conclusion that I have reached.  Buddhism is directly contrary to what I think it means to be human, and live a fully developed and experienced life.  

EDIT: I see a lot of comments stating that Buddhists do not view suffering and desire/craving as inherently bad; that it makes no ""value judgements"".  I don't understand the logic used to reach this conclusion.  The rationale behind Buddhism (as I understand it) is to reach nirvana; to be blown out, because otherwise why would you struggle through multiple lives to reach this desireless state?  How is that not a value judgement?

""The Atheistic Chinese Communist Party does not tolerate religion. Due to its Marxist sympathies the Party simply eradicates those religious institutions that do not support its Communist agenda.

EDIT: formatting

EDIT 3: My response and his response.  Apologies for the lack of capitalization.  Also,"" so that part is a little wonky.  My first response was written while waiting on this thread to fill up, and the second was using elements incorporated from the first few comments on here:

**ME:** sigh, it is more about getting rid of any possible opposition to the communist leader.

this is a common mistake that people arguing against atheism make: atheism is not an organized religion. it doesn't have specific tenets

these regimes weren't beheading people because they were offended by religion

your death toll example of poland, and used the bible to justify their persecutions of various groups. also, north koreans aren't atheists; they worship the ""dear leader"" of the time because he is essentially god to them. again, religion in that case is outlawed because it interferes w/ the dictator's absolute power.""

**HIM:** ""the Nazis were NOT, Christianity was nothing more than a spin off of Judaism and needed to be removed. However, Hitler knew he could not remove Christianity over night and so he ordered that the German church be twisted to suit his Aryan agenda. He removed all of the clergy and replaced them with Nazi clergy and even went so far as to rewrite the bible to preach the superiority of the Aryan race. Hitlers eventual goal would have been to merge the church with the ancient pagan Germanic beliefs. And the death toll in Poland is a post war total, in Communist Poland, after the Nazis were defeated.

And speaking of Communist, was a staunch atheist and his Marxism was heavily influenced by his Atheism. So the two are intertwined. You can not have Communism, marxism, collectivism, etc. without Atheism. I completely agree that these totalitarian states removed ""God"" to protect their power. In a state where ""God"" does not exist, the state then assumes ultimate power. In the old Soviet Union or in modern China when someone is murdered for having religious items, it doesn't matter if it is motivate my Atheism or because of a threat to the state power

These statements are no more or less ""hateful"" than saying that religion is responsible for killing more people than than anything else. I admit that many atrocities have been carried out in the name ""God"" regardless of who's god we're talking about. However

**ME:** ""the facts support that religion is often used as a tool to incite violence. mass murders will kill people regardless of their religious leanings.

""In the old Soviet Union or in modern China when someone is murdered for having religious items, not because they lack god in their lives.

i think that this will hopefully get across what i'm trying to say. it seems useless to argue this with you since you insist that ""atheistic regimes"" are a thing the way theistic regimes are a thing. these people are not killing in the name of atheism

2. **Jesus - the Son of God**  
This is the second step that must be supported with evidence and it has not been.  
Jesus was not an ordinary human being, even if you can find evidence for a preacher called Jesus, that in no way, shape or form, validates the claim that he also was the son of god. If you find a historical Jesus, the next momentous task will be to show he was not a human but a half-god. If he was just a human, Christianity is based upon a lie.

I grew up Mormon.  I've become less and less observant over the last decade or so (I'm turning 30 this year) and my description of myself has gone from Mormon to Mormonish to agnostic Mormon.  Still

Watching my church continue to insist that homosexuality is a sin, was probably the single strongest force pushing me away.  And yet, I still called myself Mormon.  I held that it was possible for the leadership of my church to be wrong, as they were on giving black members the priesthood for so long.  None of that shook me, I thought.

The last couple of months, and mentally rehearsed the steps I'd go through to kill myself.  It involved jumping off a building, and going through it in my mind, it felt like a dream.  The sensation of floating, while the ground comes up very fast, and then hitting the ground which is sudden but at the same time painless, and then darkness and then...and I realized I was waiting to wake up

It's the opposite of ""no atheists in foxholes"" - I was forced to face the fact that when the chips are down

This has not been a comforting thought to me.  I haven't taken strength from realizing my 'true' beliefs.  Instead

I talked to my brother about this the other day.  Earlier this summer, when talking with him, he brought up a viewpoint I'd never considered.  He said, ""I hope there isn't an afterlife.  Eternity would get boring eventually.  Basic economics - value is determined by scarcity.""

I'd never considered this, but I don't feel quite as despairing, either.

I'll start out by saying I don't go out of my way to ""deconvert"" theists into atheists. It just often happens over time with close friends of mine. The basic idea of this method is to get them to start questioning almost entirely *on their own.* This method should only involve discussions,"" ""poofed into existence,"" ""flying spaghetti monster"", etc), and you need to be pretty well read if you want a successful outcome. Most of this method will require that you approach certain topics from a Christian perspective for the sake of reaching a desired goal.

**Ideally

In the last two years, and I wouldn't suggest going out of your way to do this if they require religion for some sort of emotional void. 

All that being said

------------------

* Assumed Variables

There's a couple of reasonable variables that need to be present in order for this method to work. 

1. They *must* be open-minded. This seems like a no-brainer. If they still have all the same ethics and opinions their parents had

2. At least a semi-close relationship with the person. You're not going to convince anyone at the bar that their religious beliefs are wrong with this. It requires a series of discussions (not arguments)

----------------------

* Method

This entire process will usually take between 3-8 months from the initial discussion to the time they officially come to the final conclusion. I equate it to making a good stew, and then gradually adding in more ingredients at the correct time to get the final product. Adding all of them at once, or at the wrong time, won't lead to the ending that you had in mind. 

----------------------

**STEP ONE: Removing the fear.** Religious people may not realize it

Once you've done your homework, I cited sources and verses and he believed in the end that hell was annihilation.

You're going to have to be able to approach the subject from a Christian perspective

-------------------

**STEP TWO: Remove the source of ultimate truth.** You've already shown them that the Bible can be a drastically mis-interpreted

Do they not believe in evolution? That's an easy one. Do that one. Do they not know about the slavery and oppression of women in the Bible? Show them those and the pure immorality of what God allowed. No to the Big Bang? It's a bit more complex of a topic

There are so many ideas and concepts supported by science that are directly contrary to what the Bible teaches. This conversation might have a bit more of an air of argumentation, ""Looking at the physical evidence, it really doesn't matter what the Bible has to say about it. It's truth. It's truth I can physically test for. But the important parts of the Bible don't have to deal with how the earth came to be or how man came about. It's about how to live your life.""

Basically, but think for themselves in the matters of the world. 

-------------

**STEP THREE: Wait.** Yep, they're a theist by the end of step two. But over time, they're going to keep hopping their stepping stones out of Christianity, out of theism, out of deism, and finally into the agnostic realm.

----------------------

I honestly think this method is more interesting in that it really highlights the 'pillars' that keep religion alive. They offer both safety and knowledge. When you take away those things

Will this work every time? Nope. Is it always appropriate? Nope. Should you go out of your way to do it? Probably not. Do you believe all the Biblical interpretations that I've provided? Maybe not

----------------
**My personal experience**

I suppose I should write out my own experience as I've never really wrote it out before and part of this is more to get it off my chest
----------------

As a very young child I did as any other and just tried to please my parents not knowing any better, not sure even about singing the national anthem any more) However one student I happened to be standing beside one day didn't bow their head and pray and it confused me and I asked her why like the bold bastard I was and she replied that she didn't believe in that god. Simple matter of fact statement, blew my 4th grader tiny mind. its my clearest early memory so it really stuck to me. I wonder now if that hadn't of happened to me what my life would be like now continuing on learning false truths being further embedded into my mind through the church and my family, in the end I might have been happier and more successful in a messed up way. It seems I gained critical thought very early on however I continued going to church and listening to what my family had to say for years after but I think that put in place a kind of mental firewall. 

As I continued to grow up into a more adult like mind I reached the point where I was questioning everything told to me constantly but not really consciously, but I had nobody to talk to about my problems nor did I really think to seek out knowledge, not even my own parents because I feared what they would do and I didn't want to cause any drama or let on that I was having doubts, and I continued going to church for years. One day I reached a point where I was going to try as hard as I could to believe what I was being told every day of my life as hard as I could and I signed up for one of those bible camps at the age of 14 to see if they could help me finally figure it all out. 

It was a 2 week long period of my life I'll never forget. I listened to the teachers, and had a fair amount of speakers come out to talk to us day after day. I tried to understand their joy, tried to understand their faith, tried to believe what they did one last time. Then came the final day at camp where we were all told to go off on our own and pray, speak to god, have a spiritual experience or for those who were on the fence to decide if they believed. I tried as hard as I could, in the end practically screaming in desperation in my own head for god to tell me he was there in some way, boiling hatred and betrayal of your fellow man as I did that night. I felt emotionally drained and hollow. I had done everything I could to give god and the Christian faith a chance only to realise that everything was wrong. 

After coming home and Sunday morning rolled around I stayed in bed, I did though that next Sunday morning. I was nearly disowned after a very emotional fight with her but in the end she allowed me to stay, probably after talking to others at the church I'd imagine and over time came to accept me once again, but there has always been a bit of a distance between me and my family since then, especially my mother. I don't think I would have been able to cope with pretending like is often suggested I agree its a good idea for most who didn't come to be an atheist the way I did and to wait until being independent to say anything. Since then I've done research and still continue to do more to better understand humans, history of religion and its helped me bother living really. There have been some pretty dark periods in my short life so far my grades dropped off sharply during the rest of my school life and I only just barely scraped by and now I do labour jobs which thankfully pay well here, I've never been able to get through a college course. I have no motivation or drive still and suffer from depression, conversation with my family still feels forced to me but I'm working on that to and they still support me. I was a pretty broken person for some time. Since then I've moved to Edmonton

I have a baby daughter. We just had her baptized because in the Catholic church

I also teach biology at a Catholic school. We teach pure biology, and are competitive in our science department with public schools, but we have public Mass. 

I have two issues. 1) I was once a Eucharistic minister for the church and as such at group masses at school I am often asked (read: forced) to serve as such. How do I stop doing this with tact? Teachers have been fired for going against the religion (yeah, skipping eucharist of course. So, I feel like a fraud. How might you handle this? We give mass with the entire 1500 student body, and every administrator. As a former catholic it really rubs me wrong to receive communion and not believe it's the body of Christ. 

2) My daughter. Tooting my own horn, quiet, and curious, as we both are. My mother is a strict Catholic, and the reason we baptized daughter for the most part.

**The situation:** So

While I'm reasonably confident in my discussion of evolution, some of which I've paraphrased in my response). So—knowing that many of you have had to deal with this—before I passed this along, I wanted to run this by you fine folks to see if there is something that I should add or change.  (Suggestions for resources that would be appropriate to share, for explaining either abiogenesis or evolution at the level of a high-school student are also very welcome.)



**The text:** *(Starting at the discussion of abiogenesis.)* 
Also, in many instances, to their chemical properties. Carbon is especially prone to developing complex molecules. Once a molecule forms that is (at least approximately) self-replicating, natural selection will guide the formation of ever more efficient replicators. (There is a variety of options that fall out of organic chemistry’s competing, interconnected reactions—some examples have different molecules replicating each other, so simple, single replicators are only one option, I’ll just stick with the idea of a single replicator here.) Early self-replicating molecules wouldn’t need to be as complex as a strand of DNA.
Part of the problem with choosing the correct way in which abiogenesis progressed is that there are so many plausible ways in which it could have occurred. For instance, ribonucleotides, and  (3) it has also been shown that you can take some of the simple molecules that, to the best of our knowledge, were present on the early Earth, things like phosphate and cyanamide, put them in a pool of water, let it evaporate
http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v459/n7244/abs/nature08013.html
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis 

[...]

I agree that having a whole string of human DNA form purely by chance would be extremely unlikely. Then again, but we’ve seen above that: (1) some RNA molecules can be self-replicating—here I’ve been considering RNA, but as far as I know, this is also true of other molecules, such as some hexanucleotides and certain types of peptides—(2) we know that RNA can form from its component molecules and (3) we have observed these component molecules (ribonucleotides) and simple sugars form in conditions where you take molecules that were probably present on the early Earth, put them in a pool of water, heat it up, then refill it with water, for instance http://www.biog1105-1106.org/demos/106/unit04/media/3a.protobionts.pdf). These display some of the features of life: they can self-replicate, see here for a response and rebuttal from the researcher: http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2012/01/18/evolving-bodies-a-storify-follow-up/#.UT0Ggda87mc but there are many other suggestive examples to point to

1355937723.0,1547t0,[Update] Received a lesson on ID from my students,belengthy,143,26,103,"Background: I am a high school teacher who was invited to hear a lesson, with only the students who were presenting in attendance. I came here to get some background reading beforehand and some people asked for an update

Religiously, which surprised them, but they didn’t pay it any mind.

None of what I heard was particularly groundbreaking, so their lack of knowledge of ID doesn’t surprise me; they have accepted it blindly and will continue to do so.

Here are just some notes I took

* Christian faith is not required to believe in ID
* They accept adaptation but not species evolving from other species
* Brought up specific complexity (though not by name) and argued that DNA is information and information has to be created
* Mentioned irreducible complexity briefly (again
* When asked about mutated viruses and micro- vs macro-evolution they had no thoughts
* They questioned how random mutations can create a pair of perfectly compatible male and female organisms
* Cited Book of Job and supposed dinosaur description
* Mentioned carbon dating and how it has a limited life
* Acknowledged that creationism and ID are the same thing
* Pointed out that long-period comets (&lt;100
* Piggybacked off the comet point with the claim that evolutionists just make up stories
* Mentioned that the human body is so complex and that it’s amazing that each cell knows exactly what do
* Brought up that every culture has a flood story
* Mentioned that science has

That’s about it. We tried to avoid debates as much as possible

What I took away from it was that they had zero concept of just how tiny evolutionary changes can be and how long the process can take. If I was to ever try and de-convert someone

Oh, but I do know she purposely puts the evolution unit last in her course so there’s a higher chance that she won’t have to cover it.

I enjoy listening to your show, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.""  There were no laws made, and no one's religious freedom is in danger.

I would also like to clear up some common misconceptions about atheists, just as you can't prove that there is no teapot orbiting the Sun between the Earth and Mars.  I consider myself to be an ""agnostic atheist,"" which means I believe no one can know for sure whether God exists, but that it's more likely than not that He doesn't.

Second, and certainly not Libertarians.  He can't even say he is ""independent,"" because he doesn't know about the existence of political parties.  You could say this person is a-political, meaning he does not hold a political belief.  In the same way, he's never heard of any kind of religion, so the word ""atheist"" means nothing to him.  He is not Christian, Muslim, or anything else.  He is not religious.  It's not that he believes there is no God

Third, and that we feel the greatest immediate threat to our way of life comes from the far Christian Right.  I'm not talking about Christians like Mr. Coleman, who organized a voluntary and harmless religious event, I'm talking about Christians like Ted Haggard, who preached on the evils of homosexuality and then participated in homosexual acts; or Fred Phelps, whose church displays signs that say things like ""Thank God for dead soldiers.""

As an atheist

Unfortunately, but I would greatly appreciate it if you could discuss some of the points I've made on your show so that your listeners can understand atheism better and fear it less.  Again: most of us do not want to stamp out religion.  We only want to see the end of evil.  We're on the same side!

May nature select you!

EDIT:  I'd like to address some of the issues mentioned in the comments.

First, no one can be a pure atheist (although some may claim it).  This point was made by Richard Dawkins in The God Delusion when he was explaining atheism and agnosticism.

Second, it was taken down after FFRF complained, and no further violation was committed.  No precedent has been established prohibiting school property from being *used* for a third party religious event, only from endorsing it.

After some consideration, as this man did, use their specific government power to obtain resources for a religious event, as seems to be the common perception?

Third

Thanks to everyone who gave constructive criticism!

EDIT #2:  There was a request for Rick's response

""I wish you would remain in our audience you will be missed….thank you for your email and I really appreciate that fact that you understand the establishment clause. So many who claim your incorrect title of ""atheist""  as you correctly pointed out you are actually agnostic

understand the establishment clause.  The founders simply did not want a state run church like they had under the king of england.

____________________________________________________________________
So I know at least 2 A+ers IRL, and I basically only see them at social gatherings because we happen to move in similar social circles. 

Now

1. As Richard Dawkins learned to his embarrassment, it's impossible to deny that the Brights movement pretty much imploded.

2. The ""leading voices"" of the Atheism+ movement (I'm referring specifically Richard Carrier, and PZ Meyers) have all advocated heavy-handed censorship of their blogs, youtube channels, forums, etc. This doesn't sit well with me. I don't care if they think it's for the best, or they think they can be trusted with the power to control discourse. We laughed at the likes of VenomFangX for having to hide behind comment censorship, and rightfully so. Engaging in that same behavior is *not* a good start for your movement.

3. Taking trolls seriously. This is sort of a followup to the previous point. By taking Youtube commenters seriously (come on, either - the A+'s response to trolls is guaranteed to give them raging troll-boners, which only makes them want to troll you more. The only winning move is not to play.

4. The extensive use of ""you're either with us or against us"" language. Protip: there are a lot of people who default to ""against"" whenever they hear somebody lay down an ultimatum like that. I'm one of them. I don't care what your group stands for

5. Ideological purity. I figured this would happen as soon as I started hearing the stuff in the last point, you might change their mind on that issue. Besides, social movements tend to not be in a position to be choosy as to who their allies are), but it's virtually guaranteed to lead to ideological purges. As soon as a prominent somebody in the A+ community gets a bug up their ass about something -- gun control, gendered bathrooms, net neutrality, the capital gains tax, etc -- that's gonna be the new thing that everyone will have to agree on. Are you an A+er who has no interest in even discussing any of those issues? You'll be cast out

6. The presumption that they have a monopoly on ""compassion"" and ""equality"" is arrogance of the highest order. This is reason enough for me to steer clear of them. Groups that have that kind of arrogance make me nauseous. 

7. When all of this is combined, having no idea at all why this guy doesn't want to join (maybe he just doesn't like *you*, Richard), you call him a douche for abstaining. That's pretty douchey behavior, Richard. Way to represent your movement.

8. When faced with the inevitable pushback (and internet trolls) from all of the above, A+ers: resorting to that kind of emotional blackmail makes me not even want to sit next to you on the bus, let alone join your club.

9. The hypocrisy. Censorship of dissent (even unreasonable dissent), childish name calling, emotional blackmail, divisiveness, and casting out apostates are all behaviors that these people I used to respect (like PZ and Matt Dillahunty) rightly mocked and criticized religious groups for. But to these A+ers, it's different when *they* do it. Because they think they're *right*, and that means they're different

So there it is, call me an asshole (I'm... okay, that one is true). I've been called far worse by better people.",,False,,t5_2soy6,,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/1d6ek8/9_reasons_why_atheism_is_doomed_to_fail_and_why_i/

The other day she sends me an email asking me to answer 2 questions:

1. Fill in the blank: God is ________

2. Why do you believe in evolution?


This was my response:

-----------------------------------
1. God is...

God is the remnant of our primitive and superstitious ancestors. Or as Neil DeGrasse Tyson put it: God is an ever-receding  pocket of scientific ignorance.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HooeZrC76s0&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=89s


2. Why do I believe in evolution?

We need to establish a few things. 

The theory of evolution does NOT have a say in the origin of the universe. That science is called cosmology.


The theory of evolution does NOT have a say in the origin of life. That science is called abiogenesis. 

Evolution is the theory that explains the diversity of life on earth. 

That being said - I believe evolution is true because it contains the most evidence and explains the diversity of life. It is demonstrable through science. The scientific method and the peer-review process ensures that all the data and evidence is accurate. How? The scientific method generally works like this:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method 

The fact that evolution has been observed and that there are mountains of evidence to support this theory makes it hard to deny. A list of different species that has evolved is here:

http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-speciation.html

Remember, therefore has been published by a reputable scientific journal.

** If ANYONE had ANY evidence that evolution is wrong; they are welcome to present evidence; collect their Nobel Prize

I began attended frequently. Most of the time it was to visit interesting people who congregated there and sometimes it was rather enjoyable. The Pastor's sons were well enough and although the preaching was nothing I hadn't heard a million times before

I learned that everyone has their own different version of their christianity

For some reason she constantly preached to me or placed off hand comments about her religion in subjects unrelated. I let these slide, although offering a barometer to some, hope to others, was becoming poison to her. 

The girl I was starting to really adore was kind, I witnessed her become slowly and slowly more inured by his teachings. He became increasingly militant. Anti-atheist, anti-choice, anti-everything. Damn all who disagreed or though differently, for they are sinful and he is the only one with the right answers. 

This was typical, and nothing disguises insecurity quite like faith. She was the only member I spoke too who cannot defend her beliefs, as well as the only one who truly parrots everything dear Pastor says. Those streaks of kindness became less and less frequent. And even when they happened they came at the ransom of a sermon. If the sermon was ineffective, she'd leave them. 

Told me how beautiful it was that I cared more for her than I did my beliefs, and now, quite frankly speaking, the idea of her God existing is not only far-fetched, but appalling to me. In the end, I lost her and I feel horrible that I allowed her to taint my growing respect for the religion that breeds intolerance. Do any of you have any similar stories or experiences?

The desire to play games fades away; the desire to work becomes increasingly strong as one becomes an adult; the desire to find and share life with an attractive member of the opposite sex, desires are foreseeing one's loved ones succeed, for peace, for less variety in experiences, to feel that things are moving through the cycle of life with less help from oneself and ultimately, with no help, as the last of life's succession of desires is fulfilled and is replaced by none but the wish to rest, to cease.

&gt;In every phase, therefore, no genuine advantage of being young over being old. Each time has its particular joys, and after one has relinquished each set of desires as it runs its course, there can be no cause to envy the young nor to wish for any age other than one's own and the pleasures it brings with it, up to and including death.

(Liedloff makes a generalised assumption about the 'opposite sex and parenthood' route though life

Society seems to bombard us with the idea that young adulthood is the ideal age, expansion, struggle, learning. 

I'm glad now that I'm not stuck in the 'paradise' I would have imagined when I was 5

However, thus have an inherit social freedom *from criticism* - and people (often atheists) get quite flustered by criticism of religion, citing the breaking of this social normalcy. Atheism is judged as another religion, which it is not.

When we meet a chain email spreading an urban legend, UFOs, false stories invoked by partisan politicians, etc. Anything is up for criticism, it is not considered intolerant to take apart an assertion in that arena, because it is recognised that people from outside the arena are not fighting over two of the same thing - they are responding against bad claims which don't stack up. Everybody is happy with this, nobody would call de-constructing and highlighting the absurdity of the Obama birther conspiracists as invalid or undesired for being 'belief' intolerant.

As atheists are not religious, etc. We are not one religion battling another, we are more analogous to those who highlight the historical flaws in an urban legend via efforts such as snopes, or show absurdities in ancient astronaut claims, or find weaknesses in a scientific hypothesis to move human knowledge forward, or recognise that a compulsive gambler has an irrational bias with believing that they are going to win, etc. Society hasn't been trained to criticize any of these attempts of standing up to weak assertions - normally we would applaud it - but people are embarrassed by criticism of religion due to the carry-over of the idea that religion shouldn't be criticised, yes

Some will say that they know religious people who are charming. It doesn't matter if a 9/11 truther is nice, on the outside - charm is often confused with a decent argument - the core claim is still up for full criticism regardless of whether the 9/11 truther is now wearing a tie and has improved the quality of their conspiracy website. Especially if they are leading to enormous real world influence, and are teaching these claims to children.

Saying that atheists who criticize the claims of religion are akin to regular interfaith intolerants

This is, except by the few gnostics. What I want people to admit, is that poor assertions are just being torn apart as they in any other sense (religion just happens to be one of the most enormous, and far reaching, of these - usually often having been heavily involved in the lives of the people who post there).

I was raised memorizing the Catechism as part of my classes. I was taught many arguments for the existence of God, that to bring more souls to Christ was the highest purpose a life could have. The quote that stuck with me most was from a Louis de Wohl biographical novel about St. Thomas Aquinas: ""There are some things in faith which surpass reason; there is nothing which contradicts it.""
 
As you can tell

In 2009, so this did not go well! Each week, they would explain why I was wrong. Eventually, I gave up temporarily to do more research.

I read two books, ""That was not my only reason for believing in God, but it was the one I thought strongest.""

After reading these books

One Sunday, I would go to the 5:00. But I couldn't seem to get ready. The 9:00 Mass approached, and I struggled to prepare for Mass and move myself out the door. But I couldn't. Finally, in frustration, I pulled out my prayer journal and poured out my heart. I could not believe, for Catholicism no longer made sense. I could not attend Mass, for I could no longer believe. I begged God to help with my unbelief, but I hoped for something soon.

I got nothing.

For roughly two years, for I tried to find scientific reasons to believe, and it seemed that all the authors I read who claimed to have them had a poor understanding of science. I found that the logical arguments were problematic, also. During this time, I graduated college and began my first full-time job (two hours from home). I was fired after 10 weeks, for doing all of the no work they gave me to do. In a stroke of great fortune, I found another and higher-paying job in a month's time. The transition involved a move to a different city also two hours away from home. My sister's reaction was essentially, of course.) I find this reaction insane. Why would He have put me in the first city in the first place? Why would He have let me get an apartment that refused to work with me when I lost my job (I had to get a lawyer to help me break the lease)? When I tried to voice these concerns

In late October or early November 2012, to admit that he was right about evolution. We began to discuss the problems evolution presents for Catholics. The encyclical Humani Generis requires Catholics to believe in a literal action committed by a literal Adam. However, we can scientifically prove that there could not possibly have been a literal Adam - natural selection works on a population level. There was never a population of humans numbering less than 10,000, so far as the entire species is concerned. I also learned that my friend had left Catholicism for atheism.

After this, and lost faith for much of the same reasons I did; that is, intellectual disagreement with the factual claims of religion. Despite losing his career and community, this man left his religion for atheism. The book describes his journey, how he fought against his doubts, and how he ultimately had no intellectually honest choice but to stop believing.

I was also particularly impressed with Why I Am Not a Christian by Richard Carrier. I realized that everything he says makes sense. In short, all-knowing God who wants us in Heaven, why is there anyone who struggles with the question of whether that God exists? Even if He for some reason requires faith, why would faith be about whether he exists and not whether to follow his teachings? Plenty of people exist who act against what they believe is right; even I eat meat despite believing it is morally problematic due to it causing suffering. Further, why would this God require faith, but make people like myself who cannot have faith? I don't even believe my boyfriend loves me if he doesn't act in a loving manner for a while, and the same sentiment applies to everyone (this explains why I almost never ask for friendship when I actually need it).

These readings ended my transition, to keep from telling my family of my unbelief, to remain in a community. But I just can't believe what has so little evidence to support it, what is contrary to my reason. Because of this, according to Christianity, no matter how morally I act, I cannot be admitted to Heaven. When I realized this, I'm headed to Hell just for skipping Mass. By the rest of Christianity, then punishes them for not believing with eternal torture. Realizing this has turned me to anti-theism.

I now consider myself anti-Catholic, from homeopathy to Jesus to Hell to creationism. However, I can't blame my parents; they were working very hard to do what they believe is right. I have not yet decided how to deal with the anger and hurt caused by being raised as I was. There is no easy solution, especially as I was never taught a healthy way to handle emotion, only to take a shower, take some vitamins or sugar pills, eat a healthy meal, and I'd feel better. Worse

Towards the end of 2012, but because he doesn't believe what they do. I explained a few of the reasons I had to believe in evolution, and a little bit of the other reasons I am no longer Catholic. He seemed surprised, if not overly so, and noted that my no longer being Catholic certainly helped make my relationship make sense. He also urged me to tell our parents. I did so the first weekend of 2013.

Their reaction was about what I expected. We talked for two hours, which is false. I was told that I'm just trying to fit in with my friends, which is ludicrous (most of my friends are religious). I was accused by my father of being a feminist, and therefore not able to come back (I had tried to explain that I would reconvert for evidence). (When I told my bf this part, he was like, ""Aren't you the opposite of a feminist?"" because I WANT to be a stay-at-home mom.) They were extremely upset, of course, atheists are the most immoral of beings and certainly going to Hell.

After I left, two-week cold), so I texted him a bit but put off the actual call. About a week passed before I was able to talk to him. He said that believing in evolution requires faith, that there were too many missing transitional forms. He basically convinced my family that I am just going through a phase, a period of doubt, and that I'm still Catholic. (I am not happy about this, but I guess it is better for now.)

My sister lives on the other side of the country, though. My sister was, of course, extremely upset, and also told me I was going to Hell. Her pastor had recently given a homily (apparently) on why evolution cannot be true - something to do with God having said everything was good in the beginning.

My SIL, she posted three things on my facebook wall about why evolution is compatible with Catholicism (I think). I can't recall exactly how the conversation went, but I made a claim that suffering existed before Original Sin. She asked for proof. I posted several links showing that animal suffering is recorded in fossils that existed prior to humans. Her response was that animals don't suffer. I was livid. I don't know when I was last so very angry. (I planned to screenshot it for r/atheism to feed the anti-religious fire.) Around this time, my brother (her husband, not the brother who had sat me down earlier in the story) tried to call me. I did not notice the phone go off early enough to answer it, but I responded via text that I was not calm enough to be able to talk to him without insulting his wife due to her inane statement. Therefore, I would not talk with him at all for the time being. My sil's response was to remove her posts on my wall and send me a message about why she was unfriending me. She reiterated that it is a philosophical reality that animals don't suffer. She could have argued that animal suffering has no theological importance, it was worded in such a way that it could easily be extended into a claim that it is morally acceptable to torture infants, she retreated to ""evolution does not affect my daily life""

It has become difficult to spend time with my family, because I cannot in good conscience support the raising of anyone the way I was raised and I see baptism as a symbol of the beginnings of that. I did not explain that this was my reason (the distance is a convenient cover-up excuse).

I'm still in a lot of pain because my family and even some of my friends cannot understand that I could leave religion without being angry at God. It feels at times that people are simply refusing to believe me when I explain my experience. I had evidence, which has caused a strain in a non-Christian friendship.

I'm posting this because I need a place to vent, and wondering how to make them see the good news that there is no god. Hopefully, my story gives you some ideas. I honestly believe that if you can get anyone to the point where they are willing to open their mind even a little to the evidence for evolution or the arguments against religion, and they want to be rational people, they will deconvert.

Anyways, basically, I feel that our universe had a bunch of matter shot out at the big bang, and now we are just the product of what happens to matter in an empty vacuum. 

So particles and atoms and molecules and single celled organisms and holy crap you just made life. Now throw in some laws to govern this shit, and that's really all you need. If a robot knows he exists and knows the laws of what being alive are [(from star trek, you know?)] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYp2dx652ho), then I figure that's what life is. We've just had billions of years while robots are created by stupid animals without billions of years of development.

In the secular/Christian society I was brought up in

It, of a single God's complete love and indifference for everything and itself, won't ever go away for Christians. It seems people either swallow the contradictions in their belief system for whatever reason, or they don't. But the choice is pretty stark from the beginning. 

I wonder if other religions suffer from this in the same way? 

In particular I was wondering about polytheistic religions like Hinduism. If you can outsource different moral parts and philosophies of the world and reality to different characters in your pantheon

When I was young and first learning that life kicks you in the teeth sometimes, perhaps, but it turned out I had evidence on my side. 

In a certain polytheistic society though, I could've maybe tied together my scientific knowledge of the world with my spiritual urges much more easily. 

My question is whether the theological burden that Jesus creates is just too much for a religion to carry over a certain period of time.

Anyways, the devil is always there to instigate deception and induce false teachings, leading to heresy, apostasy, and eventually atheism. For the sake of the argument, let's dismiss any resort to the burden of proof, and let's consider as probable the existence of his Christian God.**

I believe that the invalidity of Kunt's argument is difficult to prove

**Edit:** I blundered by forgetting to set aside the definition of morality. The issue is centered around epistemology considering the Christian God (and the Devil) may exist. Please also **keep in mind that we are dealing with a new kind of Christian faith

**Edit 2:** Basically what follows from Kunt's biased assumption is that, Kunt happily concludes that following the Pope should be the best epistemological way to attain knowledge, since he the Pope is less likely to be under the influence of an *hypothetical devil*. **I know, I know, this borders on the ridiculous, but this is serious, and you might start encountering more of these kind of ''educated'' arguments in the future.**

One of the people on there was trying to be a mediator of some sort had commented something along the lines of ""Why do we need to fight? Religion and science don't have to be mutually exclusive."" It was at this point

My thought was that: ""Science is a school of thought, not evolution or the big bang theory. Those are all products of science. Those are all products or practices of scientific thinking. Science is the art of critical thinking, and religion is all that science stands against. Religion can accept ideas of science, but it cannot accept science itself. Religion can co-exist with the theory of evolution, but scientifically no one can believe in religion. Why? Two reasons. 

1. The only evidence that one can get that proves religion are feelings and personal experience. Personal experience is always spotty and can be explained away by 'god works in mysterious ways' if it fails to prove itself (ie. prayer healing

2. God is an explanation for those who don't want to dig deeper. A true scientist, that's weird, must be god.' Doing that is detrimental to scientific thinking.""

I explained this to my parents and said that I was feeling uncomfortable about that and the fact that the experience was religious based was never expressed until a few days before we leave. Although we were a very devoutly Catholic family, and Catholicism in particularly morally apprehensible and illogical.

My parents were shocked and very offended. My parents didn’t go to college and never had a lot of money. They had made great “sacrifices” to send my three siblings and me to private Catholic schools from preschool until high school (my youngest sister still attends high school with a price tag of $7, claiming that I’m wasting the sacrifice that they’ve made for me, which amounts to thousands of dollars. Although they didn’t say it directly, they also insinuated that I’m currently wasting the small amount of money they give me to help me pay for college (I’m paying for most of it with my scholarships and loans) because I’m throwing my life away. They don’t understand why I would be uncomfortable in a Christian environment and told me that I should not feel that way.

I'm old enough to remember the days before the internet, were the reserve of 'intellectuals'.  I'm also old enough to remember the impact which the work of authors such as Douglas Adams had, in their attempts to break the monopoly which philosophy and highbrow academia held over the non-religious question, when the social taboo of arguing against the assumed authority of the church began to appear in both mainstream political satire and in the alternative comedy of Margret Thatcher's 1980's Britain.

I point out that I am British — and that this is the time-frame in which I think the pre-internet age of atheism first began — for the simple reason that I think what happened here in the UK then, and Alexei Sayle, America now has Jon Stewart and South Park — and, I suppose my reason for writing this, and asking some questions around whether or not my opinion is being unwarily coloured somewhat by the reddit effect, is to do with my hope that, across the pond, think

Top 10 lists on 'how to annoy Christians' and received opinion soundbites from loony lefties which play-well on YouTube are all very well — and it should be pointed out that there is, many featuring Sam Harris and the late Christopher Hitchens, which suggests the number of Americans who now feel ready to openly espouse their atheist leanings are not being merely swelled artificially by devotees of Bill Maher and Richard Dawkins, who might just as easily have swung the other way had a charismatic figure with rather more conservative views captured the post 9/11 zeitgeist.

But I'm not the first to notice that many articles — particularly those hosted on the usual suspect blogs and subreddits, are now either bereft of serious debaters, or get quickly bogged down with pithy put-downs and in-jokes.  And I worry that, while we might be tempted to think this decline in quality conversation is due to there being fewer and fewer people who go all the way back to debating religion in the days of IRC and UseNet; that same group who are now tired of having to turn a blind eye towards the sort of childish squabbling clearly posted by those who can't be bothered to take the time to develop a vocabulary which engenders constructive criticism, that we might also be missing another very important reason for the decline in provocative and serious debate around these issues.

The first possible reason for this, into groups based upon the traditional voting patterns of their State, but who now must compete with instantaneous and unfiltered social media of Twitter and Facebook, have returned to their core constituencies to regroup, and develop new ways of injecting their ideas into the conversation.  I point to the recent appeal by Eric Hovind, for example, for his few remaining followers to begin paying $10 per month to be included on a private mailing list

We should, than the outlandish stunts once associated with the anti-everything brigade, such as those attempts to inject creationism into the national teaching curriculum for science.  It's far more likely that the next move from those still committed to this ultimately doomed movement, will be imported into the United States from overseas — perhaps via the political manoeuvrings of organisations such as [Accelerated Christian Education](http://leavingfundamentalism.wordpress.com/accelerated-christian-education/), here in the United Kingdom, who have plans to open a string of so-called Free Schools, which under current legislation allow for faith groups to opt-out of national guidelines where religious objections to the teaching of certain subjects, take precedence over the scientific consensus.

The second possible reason, we have already won the war.  

Without going into too much personal information, that any avenues into talking about 'it' with him that I might take, would make me the one who can't just 'let it go'.  What, for example, would be the point in me challenging him on what he believes and why he believes it, when simply in order to initiate this level of conversation I would be doing to someone else what I wouldn't have them do to me?

Not only does it prepare us thoroughly well for any future attempts by the minority of extremists who might wish to reignite, in my opinion, the way in which the likes of Dawkins would rather we thought about the religious people in our everyday lives, so as to better serve his narrative, as opposed to reveal the relationship between the religious and non-religious for what it actually is; a battle of ideas, where some are interested in the 'how', and some are interested in the 'why'.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/1fxtjs/has_atheism_won_the_debate_or_have_i_become/

And make sure not to base your decision to walk away based on bad teaching or theology. Thanks.



&gt;**[Dennis]**Thank you Aimee for commenting. All of the members of The Clergy Project have had extensive theological educations and spends years, they cannot continue to believe what they have believed. - 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Further, often the religious tradition itself condones, even teaches this very response to unbelief. Yes, it is very sad that this would be the case but it is all but universally true. - Dennis



&gt;**[Aimee]**  I love polite debate- or disagreements rather! :) I say bad theology or teaching and I do stand by the statement. One is able to receive a PhD in Theology and still have had bad teaching and then incidentally taught incorrectly. The Holy Spirit gives us the ability to discern the things of God and that comes from total and complete submission to Christ- can't have one without the other. That same Christ teaches us to love one another and put them before ourselves- which is what all Christ followers should do. We should always lead with love. However


&gt; **[Dennis]** Ah
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;It keeps one in the ""faith box"" by sweeping any questioning or intractable issue under the rug of ""you just have to have faith"" even though it does not make sense, which is a hallmark of any rational inquiry?

&gt;
&gt;One can dismiss the disturbing fact that people who are some of the most educated and knowledgeable people in the origin of the Bible and what it teaches have chosen

My transformation started with a single argument. 

When I was in a youth group Sunday school there was a debate that went on between the teacher (a woman I trust and love still, energetic and would get down to earth with you) about ""once saved always saved"" (can you accept Jesus and fall astray and still get into heaven, like a one way ticket with no expiration). These two people, who I followed completely and held highly, were in leadership positions in the church yet couldn't agree on a pretty important topic. How many more posts of the Bible were this heavily dissented among those I trusted? Why was I following them, which one am I supposed to trust? It wasn't fair, they are both good people and I don't want to choose sides. This led me to start questioning everything, paying Devil's advocate. I learned way too quickly that half of them couldn't agree on most of the Bible

A couple years later I found out my parents (who both had passed away by my 14th birthday) had gotten married due to a pregnancy. **Wait.** A child out of wedlock?! *My* parents? The perfect Christians who raised me? What the fuck? They lied to me about why they got married, I had so many questions, I cried in agony many nights, partially because I missed them, partially anger. 

More questioning. Question everything in my life, what... 

Where was God in this? He  wouldn't answer me. My conscious, just empty feelings. 

This led to questioning sex before marriage. If my bastard sister was the start of what became my life,"" the term used so broadly now to promote abstinence. Why would they do that? ""Okay"" I thought, so sex isn't bad. I lost my virginity soon after and I wasn't struck down, awesome! It felt great and emotionally connected me to my SO, but I dare not tell my friends and family this, I would be discommunicated and hated. I kept to myself and pretended to go on as a good Christian, which everyone thought I was. 

Fast forward another couple years, at this point I considered myself agnostic with a distaste for organized religion. I kept trying new sins to see what they were like, I drank and partied, I cussed, I had *fun.* I was still a good person though, right? I felt a slight guilt still, and couldn't shake it. 

Then, and it rocked my world again. It just made sense, this is why prayer never worked. *Is there even a god or am I just praying to a milk jug?* Then I considered the unthinkable, I started looking into atheism and if it fit me. It was like Christmas, presents of knowledge lying at my feet, all I had to do was unwrap each bit of knowledge and inside was something that answered my questions from so long ago. I became am atheist. 

Yet again I dare not tell anyone

What followed was a year of struggling with acceptance and how to tell others. 

I consider myself lucky to have accepting friends and family, I felt awful). Even though he still thinks I will magically come back to God, he was extremely understanding and we calmly test each other in debate all the time, and he is still a father figure to me.

Why I love being a Muslimah. 

This post is being written as an answer to Megan who is planning on converting to Islam insha’Allah. She’s having the same troubles I had with my own parents (and am still having unfortunately) so I hope that what I say can be used to make her conversion much easier insha’Allah. 

First, protected them from cultures where it was, in fact, common to truly oppress women. If you look back in history to the pre-Islamic era, women were most definitely treated as having less value than men do. Unfortunately, this has carried on throughout other cultures, even today. Islam is trying to fight that. 

1. Men can’t get anywhere without us. Paradise lies at our feet. As related by Mu’awiyah, but The Prophet (SAW) told him “…remain in your mother’s service, because Paradise is under her feet.” And this has been related in other hadith’s as well, with the Prophet (SAW) repeating something similar to this. 

2. Hijab is made to protect us. It gives men a chance to stop judging us based on our bodies, and He wanted to protect us from that. From what society is saying our bodies should be like, because with hijab, people can no longer demean us for what our bodies look like, but for the way we speak and how we hold ourselves. 

3. Women are equal to men in Islam. The Qur’an states that “And for women are rights over men similar to those over women.” [2:228] Allah swt commands that we understand that men and women were created equal

4. Women can’t marry non-Muslim men in order to protect our rights. What other religion does that? It ensures that we will be treated the way Allah swt commands that our husbands treat us because a good Muslim man will uphold what the Qur’an and the Prophet (SAW) says. That cannot be guaranteed with a man who follows another religion that does not treat women as equal in the way that Islam does. 

5. Women come first in Islam. “As reported by Abu Hurayrah, who is the person who has the greatest right on me with regards to kindness and attention?” He replied, ‘Your mother.’ ‘Then who?’ He replied, ‘Your mother.’ ‘Then who?’ He replied, ‘Your mother.’ ‘Then who?’ He replied, ‘Your father.’”

6. There is a whole chapter in Islam dedicated to women. Al-Nisa’. What other religion can say that they have that?

7. Women pray behind men, should never be a place of temptation. Even Allah swt knows that men’s heads tend to wander~

8. Women’s rights. ‘Nuff said. There is a list of what women have a right to in Islam. From inheritance to right to marry or to divorce to working. A woman’s rights are protected. 

There is so much more, I couldn’t tell you the half of it. But there are an infinite amount of reasons as to why I am happy with my place in Islam. I love being a Muslimah because this is the only religion where, as a follower of our Prophet (SAWS) and of Allah swt, I know I am protected. Not only from the men within my own religion but from men on the outside as well. I’m always safe. Allah swt made sure of that. 

May Allah forgive me for any mistakes I’ve made. Insha’Allah this helps and others who are much more experienced and wiser than me can give you more and better input.

So with that in mind I thought it might be an enlightening exercise to hold this against some of the thoughtful and penetrating critique I have come to find here frequently.


Opinions are always welcome (as if they could be avoided :) ); however my greatest hope is for cited contradictions to Dr. Habermas.  For two reasons...


1. One is because I simply find his article much weaker on cited support than the text implies...

2. ...and second is because personally my greatest moments in establishing / reinforcing my Christian faith have come when I have opened my mind as far as my limits allow to truly evaluate what my faith ""is"" when compared to critique from someone ""off-the-script""

He was brought up in a heavy Pentecostalism family. At the moment

His brother and him were not allowed to see their mother, computers...) and were only taught from the bible. They learnt to read by reciting and copying bible verses. They had the bible literally beaten into them (bruises and all).

I know I can't help his brother (he clearly needs help as well), to allow him some deeper thought processes about what happened.

Thanks for reading if you make it through; sorry I couldn't make it shorter. 

I wish I could come back with some good news, I know; get your ""I told you so's"" out of the way. We just broke up last night. My world is crushed, and I really don't know what to do with myself. I'll fill the details.

I took some of the advice from the great responses I received and we started discussing various topics in order to get a better understanding of each other's position. We started with the bible, even if it doesn't make any sense. You can explain how Santa delivers presents around the world in one night... Noah's ark, giants, the rib story; I learned that she accepts the ALL of the word as literal truth. I tried to explain how I think some of it isn't possible with everything I knew and sources that I included, but it was no use. I've never met anyone like this before... and call me crazy for not realizing this sooner, but I honestly just assumed too much. 

I felt bad for making it seem like I was attacking her faith. By the sole fact that I denied God, the age of the earth, the big bang concept etc... I felt the need to clear her misconceptions, of which she had many.

Me: ""God had to have some means of creating the world; how do you think he did it         scientifically?""

Her: ""I'm not ignorant to the world

This was the gist of her answers to a lot of my questions...

 I was as respectful as I could have been and explained things as carefully as possible using the help of some redditors

I put A LOT of effort into this and included several sources of good evidence. We even went to the Chicago, and after a lot of emails pointing out her misconceptions and illogic, it didn't work. The last email I sent was clearing up her points about intelligent design and how and why we know they're discredited. She didn't seem to like this though since she kind of blew up on me over texting without much of a response. She must have felt conflicted and lashed out.

So, by pushing him to the side. She wants a husband with that commonality. I'm struggling to see how a smart girl like her who respects evidence and science in pharmacy, bio chemistry and micro cellular biology, rejects evidence in science in other realms. It does not make ANY sense to me. 

Keep in mind, but I can't help it. She's as crushed as I am and she even says ""it doesn't make sense."" None of my family or friends can believe it either. I can't emphasize enough how well we fit.

This is so unlike me to say

* Are the connections drawn between the former Republican candidates and Dominionism very strong?
* Do you think such a movement could ever get real traction?

I explained (to the best of my ability) plate tectonics, structural similarities between organisms, endosymbiotic theory, carbon dating, and everything had an (infallible) explanation.  I resorted to the long term e. coli experiment.  I provided mountains of evidence, and still I couldn't ""prove evolution"".  It was just a theory.

I stated that scientists aren't capable of ""proving"" anything only disproving null hypotheses.  I then proceeded to differentiate between the definition of theory in scientific fields and the more general definition.  I mentioned how no study in 150+ years has been able to disprove evolution, so I was wrong.

I stated no theory is 100%

I wasn't trying to break her faith.  I just wanted to open her up to the possibility to accepting evolutionary theory.  I didn't want an argument.  I didn't want to be burdened with essentially arguing against her belief in god.  My pleas for objective thinking fell on deaf ears.

This all happened because I mentioned how significant it would be if the Curiosity Rover happened to find evidence for microbial life on Mars.

I am breaking this up into sections. If you don't want to read it all


**Nationalism**  - I could list a thousands examples of this, [Part 3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ2zWvWrArM).) I watched the video just a few months ago, but I can distinctly remember how the US media reacted to this story. [Hugo Chavez calls bush the Devil](http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,214709,00.html) was the headline, [repeated ad infinitum](http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/americas/09/20/chavez.un/index.html). In none of the articles do they articulate the points Chavez was trying to make and instead make him sound crazy. Add to the fact that he is portrayed to be Anti-America (""US on the way down"") in order to get readers to cling to their nationalism-religion and block out any chance that they would ever listen to a thing he has to say. You'll have to watch his speech in order to compare and contrast the difference.

**Economic Systems** - Face it

**Political Parties** - Here's a [great video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skw-0jv9kts) showing how you can clearly see faults in opposing political parties

**True love** - I have been living with my girlfriend for about a year and a half. I love her and trust her, then we will go our separates ways. I was married once, now divorced, and it was the hardest thing I have ever had to go through. I literally spent years building up an imaginary idea of our relationship. It wasn't true. Friends and family tried to tell me, but I refused to see the light. I had **tremendous** faith and belief in that relationship that defied all evidence. I paid the price for it dearly. I'm not saying that the emotion of love is fake - it certainly is a real feeling. Just make sure not to turn your relationship into a religion.

**Professional Sports** - Living in Pittsburgh, they look at me like there is a third arm growing out of my head. Predictably, individuals will treat me DIFFERENTLY after finding out that I do not follow sports. Either by ending the conversation or by not making future efforts to socialize. You should see the reactions when I don't know the names of famous sports players. I imagine in other cities it is not as bad, but here it is terrible. I get the worst reactions from women, who act like I am *less of a man* because they know more about sports than I do. When I use to be on Facebook, I even lost two REAL LIFE aquaintences for posting an article about how the [Pirates are the worst team in the history of north american professional sports](http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/sports/pirates/a-look-at-the-pirates-20-years-of-futility-655651/) after they left comments about how I am an asshole for not supporting the home team.

**I'm sure there's more** - That's all the ones I can think of right now. I'm curious what similar faith based systems you've escaped from that are very similar to religion

Once upon a time, located at 33 Union Road, in Spring Valley, NY. 

 
I had a rebbe in pre-1a that I remember quite clearly. His name was Rabbi Hertz. All the kids loved Rabbi Hertz. 
Well
Another thing about Rabbi Hertz. 
I distinctly remember going over to his house for Shabbos with other kids in the class. He would invite his favorite students over for Shabbos. It was an honor for us little, but I distinctly remember sleeping in a bed with several other boys and the Rebbe. 
Now
I don't know about the other kids. I don't know if anything happened. I just know that I slept in a bed with the Rebbe and some of the other boys. I know that the Rebbe was very ""fatherly"" with us. We snuggled with him
 

One more thing about Rabbi Hertz. He was a violent animal who beat children in his class. So while I got my first Chumash
 

I went to Vien for the first thirteen years of my life. Thirteen hellish
I got special treatment. My parents were divorced; my rabbis and the Menahel (principal) knew this. Every few weeks I'd get called into the Menahel's office. His name was Rabbi Rottenberg; the irony of his last name was not lost on me. He found different reasons to call me into his office; I was in there almost every day  towards the end of my time there.
 

We had a routine. I'd come in, books, papers, pens. Rabbi Rottenberg wouldn't start talking to me right away. He'd appear to be concerned with some papers, or a book. I'd sit there for a bit, squirming. Finally he'd address me. He'd ask me if there was a TV in my house. They strongly suspected the existence of a TV in my house. My parents were divorced-that alone made me a problem, and I also was quite the little ringleader of my class at that point. (Rabbi Rottenberg once walked into my classroom during recess to find me standing on the Rebbe's desk, with a Flying V drawn on the markerboard behind me.) 
So every time, which I wasn't supposed to know about. She hid the existence of this thing from me, but I used to hear the high-pitched frequency whine late at night, so I knew about it. 
Anyway, but both my parents denied it, and so I denied it. Catch-22, if I deny it, then I continue to be interrogated by this guy, sometimes daily. If I admit the existence of the TV, I'd be expelled immediately.
I have no idea how many times I sat in that forsaken office on that uncomfortable chair, while this bastard just repeatedly asked me about a TV for an hour. He made my life a living hell, I lived in fear of him and in fear of being called to the office for another interrogation.
So I hated my time there. I tried to cut school, lie to the Menahel, lie to my mother, lie to my father; I even lied to my friends about my parents being divorced. None of my friends in Vien ever knew that my parents were divorced until I told them, shortly before I finished elementary school and went to live with my father in Brooklyn.
 

My Rebbeim always liked me. I was a good kid who charmed the adults into thinking I was a quiet, from pre-1a through 7th grade, beat classmates of mine. (I skipped 8th grade, the system was all messed up in that school.)
I had one classmate, w̶h̶o̶'̶s̶ ̶n̶a̶m̶e̶ ̶I̶ ̶c̶a̶n̶n̶o̶t̶ ̶r̶e̶c̶a̶l̶l̶ Rabbi Boim. I remember Yitzchak crawling away, while this monster followed and kicked him. A small, mentally-handicapped child was kicked on the floor by an adult while the rest of the class sat and watched in shocked silence.
 

This was accepted behavior in my school, and one of them (Rabbi Hertz) was almost certainly molesting children. Many of them were Holocaust survivors, and because of their experiences, were totally unfit to be dealing with children. They were not trained professionals, they certainly didn't have any degrees in child psychology, and they dealt with difficult children with violence.
 

I rarely think of these stories today. I'm not bitter; this doesn't run my life. 
These memories came flooding back on Sunday when I went to protest against the ""internet asifa"". 
I went to protest because the leaders of the community ignore the pedophiles in their midst, or face having their children expelled and ostracized. How many children are going to be interrogated by their own Rabbi Rottenberg about whether or not there's a computer, smartphone, or internet in the house? 
 

So, fuck off. That's right, there's no better way for me to tell you how I feel without swearing. 
Maybe you had a better experience that me
You want to say that I had a bad experience so therefore I'm a bitter, I DO GET ANGRY. I am furious! I am upset that you want to ban the internet in your community, you want to know why? The internet saved my life! It was a window to the outside, and at thirteen, I understood that immediately. I love the internet. I love being able to easily access any knowledge, opinion, image
 

Guess what. The first time I saw porn wasn't on the internet. It was in Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin
I didn't learn about sex on the internet. I learnt about it in Vien
 

Don't block access to knowledge. It'll find its own way of getting to the masses. You might as well teach people how to use tools properly
 

 
PS. I just want to say one thing. I am not a bitter, and that this is how I deal with it. Yes, everyone is shaped by their life experiences, but I educated myself and have been on a journey of self-discovery and truth ever since I was self-aware. Don't denigrate my opinions because you can't wrap your head around the fact that someone can be irreligious and happy. Guess what. I identify culturally as a Jew; I celebrate Yomim Tovim (holidays), I often attend Friday night meals. It's possible to be this way and be happy. It's possible to get along with each other. #LOVE

**“Homosexuals cannot reproduce nor have/raise a child

Not true. I’ll put the fact that people who don’t wish to have children can still marry and the fact that marriage is viewed differently by many individuals thus sweeping statements such as “Marriage is about a strong family unit.” are not true aside. 

Homosexual does not mean infertile. We can still reproduce via artificial insemination. Or adopt

**“Marriage is and has always been a Christian institution

The fact that something is/was is not a valid reason as to why it always should be. Not to mention that ancient societies predating Christianity such as [Rome and Greece](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_same-sex_unions performed homosexual marriages) (emperor Nero comes to mind) and the first laws against SSM and making it punishable by burning didn't appear until after Rome Christianized (shocker).

**“Homosexual couples are not fit as parents. Studies have shown children of heterosexual couples are significantly better off than those of homosexual couples.”**

This is one that is simply a lie. I have seen zero studies backing this claim that haven’t been flawed in their methods. The infamous [Regenerus](http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2012/10/30/1110591/regnerus-admits-gay-parenting/?mobile=nc) study comes to mind first. The study was flawed for MANY reasons but the main flaw would be that the homosexual sample of single parents, high income couples. I have only seen studies showing that homosexual couples are [no more or less fit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_parenting) to raise children. Though if I were to some across a study showing that children of homosexual couples suffer more on average than heterosexual couples I would most likely claim that it would mostly likely be because of the way society treats them for having two parents of the same sex and NOT the fault of the parents.

**“Forcing churches to marry same sex couples infringes on religious freedom.”**

In the US any ways, non-Christian marriage as they have always been. I will say that in places where churches are actually allowed to give out marriage licenses that they shouldn't be allowed to discriminate since they are now dealing with a government institution in my opinion, but when it comes to simple ceremonies they should be allowed to be as anti-gay marriage as they please.
To summarize, or strengthen them. :)

Raised atheist by an atheist and a lapsed Catholic ""cultural christian"".

Converted to Catholicism in high school

I fully admit that my personal experiences are not enough to convince other people, however, I've come to be convinced that the resurrection is fact, and that Christ is God, and that's where I presently sit.

I'm married to a Christian man, and he is the one who's challenged me the most.

This review is for: [The Good Book: A Humanist Bible (Hardcover)](http://www.amazon.com/The-Good-Book-Humanist-Bible/dp/0802717373/ref=reg_hu-rd_add_1_dp)

----------------------------------------------------

I bought this book with no expectations. I had read an article about it

This book is not a compilation of work. You will not open it up and find passages from various works called out by author. It is truly written in the style of the Bible - Grayling has taken the collected wisdom of hundreds of secular philosophers and melded it together in the flowery prose form typical of the Bible. There is no reference list at the back to tell you where anything came from

The Good Book begins with Genesis, but saying the things I believed! I didn't realize how much I would enjoy hearing Darwin's theory of evolution told as a beautiful story of how we began and the cycle of life.

As you make your way though the book, introduced without preamble, just snippets of conversation or story which attempt to showcase an idea. There are passages on grief and death as well.

If you are looking to learn the works of these philosophers in an intellectual way, there really is something cathartic about having grief and death and moving on with life written in this way.

I feel in some ways as an Atheist this may have been what I was missing and didn't realize it. I didn't have anything to help me find a way to feel good about my place in nature's greater story, I'm by no means an expert, but I have read some of these works and they are by no means easy to absorb.

So, it is a great work. ",,False,,t5_2soy6,1350375106.0,,

Edit: Really happy to see all of the support. Simply talking this through and receiving insight from all of you made me feel a lot better in addition to some of you being in similar situations. I'm going to talk to her the first chance I get

A short background: 

I am an atheist (raised Catholic) and my girlfriend of 2 and a half years is a non-denominational, I was asked by her parents about my beliefs, and I just said that I was confused because I really was. It's important to note that early on, my girlfriend mentioned that her dad prohibited marriage to someone outside of their religion. 

So, tried going to their bible church several times, but each visit left me even more confused, alienated, and uncomfortable (the place is a freaking rock concert for Jesus!). I then decided to try and figure out what exactly I believed in which, ironically, led to my inevitable disbelief. 

Now, but I don't want to get married ""for god"" or make a promise to ""him"" as the pastor kept pushing and pushing through the entire ceremony. I would want to get married for *her* and for *us* and not live in the shadow of a supernatural being. The whole family seemed proud of the wedding and her aunt justified giving away her daughter on the grounds that she ""couldn't ask for more from her daughter marrying a 'godly' man.""

I have a feeling that my girlfriend suspects my lack of belief since I stopped going to church whenever they'd ask (very liberating by the way), especially about the state of the universe, god, contradictions of the bible, etc. The last thing I want to do is push these things onto her as her family attempted to push Christianity onto me, but I'm slowly opening her mind here and there to different possibilities that I can tell she has been interested in. While I don't *think* she will look at me differently, her family's perception could be way different.

I guess my whole point in writing this is to ask if this is a relationship doomed for failure in the long run. I realize values and beliefs play a huge role in a relationship with a significant other, and are best friends. 

So

***tl;dr:*** i have a Christian girlfriend from a Christian family. I inevitably plan to marry her. Are atheist/christian marriages doomed for failure

""Christians are an oppressed minority""

""No they're not

Now, officially exported entertainment such as music and television, and unofficial anecdotal evidence combined with news reports that I imagine are primarily for internal consumption. This causes a huge disconnect, I read a survey that suggests something along the lines of 40% of Americans believing in creationism and I call bullshit because if that number was so high we'd see at least one mainstream TV program where the characters are devout Christians, a version of House where the people pray before every operation, a clone of Glee where the main characters beat up the gay students to a laughtrack. Due to this discrepancy I come to 3 possible conclusions

1. Pop culture in the US is overwhelmingly secular and

2. There is an entire underground Hollywood that produces Christian media that never makes it across the Atlantic

3. The number of people who fall under the Christian conservative umbrella is extremely inflated.

Now I know there are films for Christians, they're not even close to being mainstream, so #2 doesn't seem to be the case. I'll be very surprised if in the foreseeable future there's an entertainer as big as Lady Gaga who sings about being ""born this way but changing through faith"" and publicly advocates small government, creationist education and traditional marriage, those kind of things currently seem like career suicide.

I can't comment on #3.

#1 seems to me to be the most likely explanation, even if they are ""the majority"".

So the question is

**1. Is this the case?** If a Christian claims to you that they're an oppressed minority and cites the fact that popular culture seems to be overwhelmingly against their entire value system, and is therefore alright?

**2.If so, are the Christian demographics like any other entitled to a piece of the pie or is it laudable that they do not get it.

**[edit]** The responses from you folk are simply overwhelming. This is what is good. This is what I love about the Atheist community. Helping those who struggle against the religious grain and all the mindsets it entails. I know this is all *'undergrad Atheism'* stuff

From reading all your thoughtful posts I can conclude:

1. Personal responsibility

2. It takes courage to be Atheistic as the buck stops with oneself. 

3. Sometimes things are shitty and acceptance is all you can do (thank you craybatesedu for telling it like it is)

4. The god voice is just residual, takes strength. Knowing that there is nothing there, other than myself, but...

5. ..There's always other people

6. Find solace in the stars

7. Buddhism?

8. ""The brain is powerful and it's in constant conflict."" jmblock2. If I/we appreciate the majesty of our brains and master looking at our thoughts objectively then we shouldn't need an outer source of comfort. This is the philosophy that needs to spread. That we can be our own friend. 

9. "" As long as i can anything i can feel - then i'm alive and that's better than not being alive."" manwithnostomach. Which I suppose means to look objectively at your suffering. Out of body objectivity. Which I guess is what 'god' would usually be the substitute for.

The discussion started while we were talking about PAS and Euthanasia.( I am doing a project for school on the subject and asked what side of the debate my father was on ) 

We discussed a lot of things about christianity

I also couldn't use the full arguments i wanted to because he does not yet know I'm not christian and doesn't need to know that just yet. While both of his main responses are absurd

At the end of the little debate (if you would like to call it that) we were discussing hell and why people want to follow god. I said that most christians, but he replied by first getting a handful of coins from our coin bucket and put them over my hands and said,"" do you want these coins?"" 

the rest of it looked something like this: 

me: sure

him: All you have to do is ask

me: can i please have those coins 

Him: sure *drops the coins into my hand* did you deserve those coins? did you earn them? 

me: no 

him: same thing with god, why would i look back at what i missed when i can look ahead to where im going? 

me: because

Him: im not concerned with hell when i am looking forward to the amazing things to come. i dont think everyday ""WHEW, guess i was lucky"" 

that last part is what led me to believe he misunderstood what i was trying to say. I still think that somewhere in the back of his mind

I guess what I'm asking is, being that jesus lived under roman rule and that the hebrews, the ""original"" god followers, never mentioned hell, but he didnt seem to think that this would have influenced the new testament perspective of hell. i didn't attempt to tell him why this thinking was flawed, because i realized at that point that i wasn't going to change his mind and that it was pointless

I've arrived at this conclusion, and my thoughts have come to a standstill without any opposing debate. 

Here it goes. Everything ever known is entirely based on our ability to perceive reality through one of our body's senses. Every sensory receptor responds to a specific energy stimulus, electromagnetism. The only way we're aware of electromagnetic energy is because we were able to observe it's effects, either directly or though tools that transformed them into an immediate sensory experience.) So, our understanding of reality is completely limited by the perceptive capacity of this meaty aggregation of molecules we call our bodies. Who knows what other forms of energy exist all around us without our awareness because we haven't yet developed the tools to transform them into a perceivable form? Nobody, that's who. Therein lies my issue with the denial of god. Maybe “god” is just another energy that's out there. Isn't that completely plausible? And, considering our somatic limitations, how can anyone possibly justify outright denial of its existence?

I am a HS coach at a public school in southern California.  I recently found out that the head coach is a creationist.  This being my 2nd year working at this school

Since this time, I am well-armed to debate him, and he cannot win against me (as I've already proven to him last week).  However, you all know that creationists (especially at age 60) are not going to change their minds.  And I am ok with HIM deciding to believe in these things, and rejecting science.  I do not expect to change him.  It really bugs me that he has been telling the kids these things.  It also makes me wonder how long it's been going on.

My goal is to get him to stop talking about it all together, I want to avoid the context of science vs. religion.  This school appears to be largely religious, so do you think this can be done?  Can I explain these things without getting in trouble?  I was a biology major in college, and I can explain evolution/big bang theory in plain language to the kids.

Also, and kindly ask him to not indoctrinate the kids, since I'm pretty sure THAT is illegal at a public school.  Hopefully that works.  My question is really about if a coach that isn't certified to teach science can talk about it during practice.  I coach track and field, and I work alone with about 15-20 athletes (who are not coached by the head coach).",,False,,False,t3_11oy21

I am assuming Atheists wouldn't believe in the existence of peculiar souls regarding the flaws in concept of how every human could have a soul and technically grow and make souls through childbirth (the complexity of what you'd even call life would characterize whether someone has a soul or not

The flaws within the concept of a supernatural transfer of a soul to something else, and for myself the end result Nihilism (no stance one way or the other).

If there was an afterlife, a lifestyle, a cellular organism of some kind, what else would we be? Anything beyond that wouldn't even be 3rd dimensional IMO.

The whole act of spending time in philosophy thinking about this special moment in our lives having been influenced by our surroundings on Earth to think of where our ""souls"" would end and having them happen to be in a place where a soul/consciousness wouldn't even be able to recognize as e.g. heaven, well it wouldn't even be worth it to think about it if we couldn't even change that.
Our physical bodies and the concept of justice and evil (e.g. if my friend drinks this water s/he'll live but someone else might not have some, therefore we can't change our position in the afterlife at all in any way to balance whatever your opinion of happiness etc. is.

How does this happen? I've tried to put myself in the mind of a ""re-converting atheist, there was no turning back. Religion collapses like a house of cards once you start to look at it from the outside without the influence of the church trying to keep the wool over your eyes. 

The re-converts almost always cite ""I feel it is true in my heart"" as their reasoning for turning back to religion. Even if you ""felt in your heart"" that God was real

So; how/why do former atheists actually end up going back to the church? The only thing I can think of is that they weren't a ""real"" atheist, here... but I will anyway: were they an atheist because they had learned the truth about the origins and the historical claims of their religion, and decided that it just didn't add up? Or were they an atheist because they were ""rebelling"" against something, but still harbored connections to their beliefs within themselves?

Apatheism

In practical or pragmatic atheism

individuals live as if there are no gods and explain natural phenomena without resorting to the divine. 

The existence of gods is not rejected, according to this view /quote
Personally I had heard of Apatheism but with another definition. That one don't care about gods and not about atheism either. 

But the term Practical Atheism was new to me. seems they have given it its own entry too. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatheism this link also list it as a viable position.

What are your views on this way to relate to the issue? 
Do you accept it? If there is some philosophical error 
then what could that be formally named? Or is it an okay position? 

Is apatheist a separate category or always an adjective to atheist? 
You are always an apatheistic theist or an apatheistic atheist? 
in same way that it is accepted there can be an agnostic theist 
and an agnostic atheists? 

Edit. Thanks indeed for the positive response. Apatheism is an odd thing 
among active atheists on forums but in practice most atheists in population are very passive

The discussion started when my grandpa recited the old phrase ""there are no atheists in foxholes"". He was in the army, from military atheist organizations to atheist combat veterans, he refused to even entertain the possibility that someone could think differently that he did. Eventually, he just up and left the conversation.

That wasn't the part that stung the most, she defended my grandpa's views, saying that they are a result of his experiences. I did my best to explain that I wasn't doubting his experience or what he gained from them, only bringing up similar people who had different experiences. Eventually, I offered to show her the website for the military association of atheists, found here: http://militaryatheists.org/atheists-in-foxholes/. She became extremely offended at this suggestion, and said that she would not even look at the page because she finds them ""subversive... they are destroying our culture."" 

This caught me a little off guard, and ""atheist"" servicemen. Just like my grandpa, she refuses to even acknowledge these people or learn the slightest bit about them. I was personally offended that she would say that about people like me, and I told her how I felt. Her response was basically to say ""I'm sorry that you feel that way, but it's my opinion"".

This is my first time dealing directly with this kind of bigotry. I find it unconscionable that someone would simply deny the existence of an entire group of people because it's _inconvenient_. In my grandparents' minds, I asked them whether coming back to them in 40 years with the same viewpoint will make any difference, and they said that it would still not matter. These are not particularly stupid people, in fact I consider them to be quite intelligent and well-learned, but they still are _proud_ of their cognitive dissonance. They are aware of how stubborn and closed-minded they are, and they think that's perfectly alright.

I just needed someplace to vent all of this. The rest of my family has opted to stay out of the conversation for the most part, I'm just going to avoid these subjects until my grandparents leave.

Context:
Talking with a friend about faith and his proposition is that an atheist has to have faith too in that we cannot know 'x' to be true with 100% accuracy. I have called it 'reasoned faith' in the past. Some snippets of the FB conversation both comments mine:

""I define/group faith in two different types: blind faith (typically religious faith, so we have to take the evidence we have to make a decision. The rest of it falls to 'reasoned faith' because we can't know for sure. I have looked at the evidence but I'm not, as you say, omnipotent, omniscient, and omni-present. So, I have to take it on reasoned faith that god does not exist (that's not a statement of fact

Maybe I'm using the term wrong...maybe there is a better word than reasoned faith. What word would you substitute for it? Is there a better term for what we do not yet know but have at least some evidence to believe is not so?""

From another post of mine:

""..........however

It's the level of supporting evidence [or lack thereof] we as non-believers are concerned with. The non-believers faith position could be called justified

For example: I just parked my car outside the hotel. I have faith that my car is still there where I left it. I can't see it now but it was in park, memory and evidence that the car is still there. When you believe something with reason, you possess good grounds for supposing your faith in that belief is true. Of course, while I’m reasonably sure in my faith that the car is there, it’s possible that I’m mistaken. It is possible that someone has stolen my car. The point though is that, while it's possible, it’s very unlikely that it isn't where I left it.

Believers will argue that they do, another long topic to discuss). I find it interesting to see the conundrum you (not you in particular) face when comparing Paul's definition of faith to those who try to justify God's existence via physical 'evidence'. It appears to be in opposition.""

First the argument;

&gt;(OA2) If an all-surpassingly great being exists in some possible world

&gt;(OA4) If an all-surpassingly great being exists in the actual world

Now let's fill this in for the christian god (God)

Up until age 13, fine, but I never had more than an outside curiosity in religious tradition.

Then came eighth grade. I chose to switch to a Catholic school as the public school I was in before was an awful experience. Again, so the choice was rather simple.

Overall, and in all honesty, none of them made me feel alienated or bad about the fact that I didn't subscribe. In fact, the nun in charge of my class once told me to ""be a good person and not worry about what god thinks about it"". In hindsight I imagine there may have been a hint of persuasion behind that kind of stuff, but it was never in-my-face or overly patronizing.

Though I'd heard the word atheist, I had no reason to believe in a god, but I also saw no reason to say I was anything because of my lack of belief. As Sam Harris once said, ""Atheism is nothing more than the noises reasonable people make in the presence of unjustified religious beliefs.""
This is a mentality I've always maintained

Unfortunately

As time went on, they were just the most scared of the idea of a godless person in their presence. I never was met with violence (I was definitely comfortable with sticking up for myself), but what I was met with was avoidance and fear. People turned away from me as if I had the plague. As more students avoided me, others would follow. While my friends never turned their backs on me, it was obvious that I was not welcome among the student body. I left about halfway through the school year, vowing to never refer to myself as an ""atheist"". It felt like a scarlet letter. I never wanted to be identified because of something I wasn't (religious). That just bothered me more than anything.

Over the next couple years, I suppose). Sure, I never really talked about my lack of religious belief, but I didn't really think it was much of a talking point anyway. It wasn't really until my mid-20s that I felt comfortable with referring to myself as an atheist, and even still I feel a bit silly having to justify a non-belief.

What I want to ask is that why do some Atheists seem to think that Atheism is inherently a more rational position than Theism

I take the position that the existence or non existence of a god can never be entirely proven regardless and is a matter of personal choice. For example if a god like being appeared tomorrow

Now I can appreciate Theism does not fare well under the scientific method

That being said I'm not here to try to change anyone's mind on what they do or don't believe. Just curious interested in hearing some points of view on why a lack of proof in god means such a strong regard for atheism.

**EDIT**

If God is omnipotent

If God is omniscient

If God is omnipresent

If God is completely benevolent

**/EDIT**

An omnipotent God could create all things

If, and omniscient, completely benevolent God would know how to ensure that the creatures with free will had no urge to do evil. 

If God cannot create a being with free will who does not sin, for it could not be known if God's powers were truly unlimited. 

An omniscient God knows everything that will happen and sees all that will come. Such omniscience means that our paths are part of an absolutely deterministic reality and that our actions are not chosen freely but rather ultimately predetermined, thereby negating God's law.  

If the future isn't determinable and God's omniscience means only that God can predict exactly what will evidently happen immediately before it happens, omnipotent and completely benevolent, God can and would convince any being to not commit an act of evil before the person did. If God can but does not, God is not completely benevolent. If God would but cannot, God is either not omnipresent, omniscient or neither, but certainly is not omnipotent. If we do have free will, God's plan is not all inclusive and therefore flawed and God is by definition not omniscient.  

**If God's omniscience means that God knows all that will possibly happen, according to God's law. Such a state of omniscience also seems to allow for omnipotence, in that, while God chose to allow us to choose our own path, we could still never make a choice that was beyond God's comprehension or ability to counteract with damnation.** 

However, but to claim that such a messiah would indeed be killed is to say that such a fate is unavoidable. That is to say, such things as the death of Jesus were either beyond the control of those who were supposedly given the free will necessary to avoid such a destiny. 

To tackle this problem

If one chooses the path of probabilistic discourse, this method contradicts the nature of a prophecy. 

On the other hand, regardless of the nature of the action. This claim, however, has obvious inherent contradictions as any outcome may be changed by sufficient alteration, and to say that any outcome is unavoidable is to then take the choice out of the hands of the person who possesses free will and to render the nature of such an existence deterministic.  

For example, however, humanity finds a way to avoid such a fate, the second law of thermodynamics and it's inferences about our universe must then be overturned. Thus, if God were to make a prophetic claim about the future that could be avoided, avoiding such a claim would prove God to not be omniscient, or at the very least that such a claim was not actually made by God.

1364392905.0,1b3yli,I've been told this is the place to come for actual discussion. Here's my thoughts on gay marriage (Warning: Long text post),frownifdown,85,25,58,"Below is going to be an enormous wall of text that will only interest you if you desire to have a real discussion on same sex marriage or have some confusion as to the arguments for and against it. This is a very important discussion to have, etc. If you want to, very

**1. It violates the sanctity of marriage-**
We wouldn’t want to harm the sanctity of marriages such as that of Kris Humphries and Kim Kardashian, what do you think about the thousands and thousands of cases of infidelity that are constantly happening? The sanctity of marriage, if it exists, is determined by the two people who are participating in the marriage, and if your marriage is so devalued by another marriage then maybe you need to look in the mirror and face the fact that your marriage isn't very strong to begin with.

**2. Homosexuality is a choice-**
No, one for each sex, and maybe you are a little more confused than you'd care to admit. Answer this question for me: At what age did you choose to be attracted to the opposite sex? When you can answer that question then maybe we can have a discussion, but it probably will involve some questioning about your own tendencies, and not those of others. Furthermore, I am not going to let you get away with something to the effect of “love the sinner, hate the sin”

**3. Gays can't procreate so they shouldn't get married/Gay adoption is child abuse-**
If you honestly believe that the only reason for marriage is procreation, your marriage is null and void and you are an abomination to the natural order! This is obviously a ridiculous argument for several reasons, the first being what I just discussed in how we would have to ban more than homosexuals from getting married as well. Secondly, why is it so important that we procreate? Are we really in danger of dying out as a species? Is this a growing concern for supporters of prop 8? Ironic, considering many (not all, obviously) of these same people are doing their best to keep contraception out of the hands of whoever they can. Procreation is obviously a vital part of society and even if we were completely comprised of homosexuals, there would still be procreation. Lesbian women can have sperm donors and on the other end there can be egg donors. This is not a real problem.
If you think that it is better for a child to grow up in an orphanage, etc., than it is for him or her to be raised by two people of the same sex than your moral compass is so far off that I’m surprised you can find your way out of bed in the morning. 

**4. It is against the Bible and is an abomination to God-**
This is the basis for many peoples’ main argument and it is inherently flawed. Yes the bible speaks against homosexuality, or people who work on the Sabbath. These laws were all done away with by Jesus, who coincidentally, never mentions homosexuality. He tends to focus more on loving each other, which is the exact opposite of what you are doing. Yes, homosexuality is mentioned in the New Testament, but there is some doubt about the original word from which it was translated and it is also mentioned right next to sexual promiscuity, greed
Whatever your beliefs are on the afterlife, then why must you ruin it for them? Let them enjoy their life while they can. Your judgment is not needed and God needs no help from you.

**5. It goes against what our country was founded upon-**
Contrary to what many people think, but then stepped back and doesn’t intervene) and above all, secularists. The Treaty of Tripoli was written and signed in 1796 and says “As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion…” The pilgrims were running from England because the British were trying to force their religion on them, which is exactly what is happening now. Our country was founded on freedom FROM religion as much as it was founded on freedom OF religion. There is an important distinction that needs to be made. The great thing about America is that we should all (theoretically) be able to worship, love, not offend) other people.
It is also stated in our constitution that the government is not to provide any types of benefits to people and exclude other people based on race, etc. It directly violates the constitution to exclude people from these government-given benefits because they are the same sex.
We do not live in a theocracy and if there was a serious push from the Muslim community to force all women to cover themselves from head to toe completely when in public

**6. It violates the natural order-**
What natural order are we talking about? There are over a thousand species of animals that engage in homosexual acts. There is only one species that engages in homophobia and I’m sure you can guess which one that is. Even if it is some violation of nature (which it isn’t), gasoline, air travel, plastic, the internet, and homosexuality. Going by this logic, we can eliminate all of these “unnatural” things from society and expect a dramatic increase in morality and happiness.

**7. We are going to have two dudes that want to marry a refrigerator and their pet hamster!-**
Ah, Good! Let him marry his dog! Why do you care, it doesn’t have any effect on your life! Seriously though, there is a difference between two legal adults getting married and a man/woman getting married to an animal or object that has absolutely no capability of signing a legal document, holds no legal standing, and cannot reason past basic instincts. This is a logical fallacy and it is ridiculous that it should even need to be refuted.

**8. Gay marriage will create a promotion of and an increase in gay children!-**
If a child’s sexuality is based upon their parents’ sexuality, then you clearly have your own confusion and insecurities that you are dealing with and projecting those onto innocent people is a moral travesty.

**9. Children need to have a male and female role model in order to grow up properly!-**
Of course they do! That’s why after we keep the gays from getting married
There have been millions of children that have grown up to be successful with only the presence of a mother, but I would also argue that there are going to be strong benefits of growing up in a two same-sex-parent household vs. a no parent household, which is the alternative being forced on many children who simply cannot be adopted because there are not enough wanting families for the insane amount of orphans out there.

**10. You want to see to guys making out on the street? Are you gay?-**
And the grand finale! This isn’t so much an argument against gay marriage as it is something I have had directed at me by ignorant and insecure men. I want to see two guys or two girls making out in the street as much as I wanted to see the morbidly obese couple I saw making out at the mall last week, and supporting the lowering of minimum heights for roller coasters would make me short. I simply hate seeing injustice and opposing it does not mean that I am that which I defend.

In short, so why must you do it to others? Look at what Jesus talked about when he was on earth and live your life based off of that. Focus on improving yourselves and stop blaming your misery on other peoples’ happiness. Grow up, suck it up, and realize that gay marriage is going to be legal before you know it, and the fabric of society will still be intact. Besides, why would gay people ruin fabric?!

I think about this from time to time. First the U.S. had to recognize that black people are in fact human beings (1860s). Then we had to recognize that women ought to have a voice in civic life (1920s). Then we had to recognize that *because* they're human beings, women stood up to demand that they, too, not be treated as second class ('70s and '80s). The '90s through now has been about LBGTQ rights, and today's DOMA and Prop 8 decisions are yet another step on that path.

However, scholarly way. He has taught my class the Mesopotamian influences on Genesis, and how the Enuma Elish is tied to the story of creation. He also dives into the literal exegetical meaning of each verse based upon the Hebrew (which he is fluent in) wording and context, even if it shows god as the bad guy. He has shown the scriptural inconsistencies in the Bible, declaring to us that the Bible evolves and changes its ethics and morals as it progresses. All of his claims are well supported by historical context and evidence, biblical exegesis, and he has written many scholarly papers on topics that have been put into encyclopedias and other such collections.

**In short

My professor has presented the information in the Bible as it is, Deuteronomy, 1 &amp; 2 Kings). He does not attempt to disarm god of the responsibility for each of his actions, both in the text and the real world.

**Instead

This is very interesting to me. How can a Christian believe in a god, by his definition, can not be proven to exist or has been shown to stray from his own moral code.

Also he claims the miracles and visions described most likely never happened due to their close proximity to Egyptian and Babylonian myth, the devil is under the leash of god therefore his responsibility, god created evil and imposes it upon others (Pharoah's hardened heart and many other stories), god has ridiculous arbitrary rules, and he is not all powerful since he attempts to solve problems and fails at times (such as attempting to kill Moses in Exodus or solving the problem of evil in the garden of eden). 

Many other Christians would claim god to be ""mysterious"" or that it is heretical to take these verses literally. However

*It astounds me that he is still a Christian!* His teachings have only confirmed my atheism. Many of the points he makes in class about the Hebrew Bible seem to be coming out of the mouth of Dawkins rather than himself. It baffles me

I find it so interesting that someone can still follow all of this

EDIT: Geez, but if anyone's looking through my post history, please keep in mind that this was not me at my best.

---------

I care about people.  All people.  I want everyone to be feel happy and fulfilled.  And the world, famine, disease, poverty, crime, I'm sure I don't need to go on.  There's a ton of bad stuff, and lots that could be being done about it but isn't (and, some things that are).  Now
*ultimate cause* behind any of these things.  These things are not, sure, but if you care about people, you should be happy about something that helps them regardless of the reasons why it's done.  

Religion is *not* the big problem.  The big problems are about how humans *are*; uncomfortable facts we've learned from studying our own psychology.  We identify with those who are similar to us, when we're looking for ways to solve the problems we face, we're *awful*.  When we like an idea enough, we desire to *keep* it.  When the idea is challenged, we see this as hostile, something we must fight off at all costs.  Debate, rather than being about truth-seeking, thankfully

This still isn't quite why I'm against religion.  *Fundamentalist* religion, because they already have all the answers and how dare anyone suggest otherwise.  But remember, resistance to new ideas is a problem that ultimately lies with *humans*, not fundamentalist religion.  Clinging to cherished ideas is what we do *by default*, and it takes deliberate effort to counteract the psychological biases that cause this.  In order for people to be able to do this on a wider scale, we need this concept of fighting against our own nature to be accepted on a *societal* level.  We need to fight psychology with psychology, make people less scared of changing their minds by knowing that the people around them think that ideas are only worth keeping if we don't have better ones.  Over the past century, as its own concept, so they can *notice* situations that might cause their reasoning to go astray.  And, is *good*.  Idea-replacingly

And here is where religion becomes a problem.  To get more people to care about and thereby support scientific progress, so that the ones that don't hold up can be replaced by new and better ones.  We can't make an exception, saying that religious ideas are exempt from this.  If we did, there would inevitably be important ideas that infringe upon things that a religion teaches.  People would wonder if it's *okay* to question the teachings, the result being that less overall effort would be put into examining these ideas.

I don't think religion can survive in anything close its current state in a society like this.  People care *very deeply* about their religious ideas, I'm not being metaphorical.  Religious people in this society would be under a lot of stress, which is a very real thing that impacts a person's health and happiness.  Yes, you could claim it's for their own good, that they'd ultimately be happier once they abandon their outdated beliefs, but this doesn't make the problem go away.  Not everyone could handle this.  There are people whose lives have been literally saved by religion, whose faith is the only thing that keeps them going, and, if I could come up with some idea that gives us the same benefits without also causing *this*

My desire to end religion isn't because I don't like religious people.  I don't even desire to end religion, to famine, to disease, to poverty, to crime.  Each time we find a cure for a disease, each time we invent a technology that gives us more resources or helps us make better use of the resources we have, each time we refine or replace an economic model that helps us determine where our resources can help the most, and this is the best idea I've got.
