1354735842.0,14c648,I got a great idea for a new Sims game... What if you could choose to start your family in 1900 and follow your legacy throughout all past decades to today (or further)?,Missbrightsidee,408,43,72,"I want to start off by apologizing for my bad English in the text below.

Sims is a game where you can play as the same sim from it's birth to it's death

What if we could actually follow our sims not only through their aging but also through diffrent decades? Thats my idea! 

You could start in whatever decade you wanted to from 1900-2010 (perhaps a future decade). You could also choose how long each decade should be

For every decade there are new objects to unlock that are historically correct to the decade you are now entering. Like new improved pluming and electronics and clothing.

I am also thinking classes like underclass, this also changes throughout time. Also different classes have different work options. When you have reached a certain goal like get enough money or get a certain amount of promotions you get to choose to upgrade to a higher class likewise if you lose all your money and are in a higher class you will become a lower class.

So this is my idea for a new sims game

Instead of releasing frequent patches to fix the issues that need to be fixed, but there is a difference between providing DLC while supporting the game, and providing DLC to cover up the problems with the game.

I look at The Sims 2 and then look at The Sims 3 and I just can't help but wonder, then to actually have fun with it. The Sims 3 is no longer a game, but a mundane chore, a child that you have to constantly feed and change its diaper. 

I think the final straw for me was with Supernatural's implementation of zombies. How is it, Vampires etc. But not zombies? Yes, you don't have to have the lunar cycle on, but it's absolutely ridiculous if I'm trying to play a realistic family and then zombies just start popping out of nowhere. This is something that can be easily fixed but The Sims 3 Dev Team does nothing. They release patches every 3 - 4 months? Are you kidding me? There are developers that take 3 - 4 months to release patches, but that's because they are also providing us free content with it, this is just a simple case of taking care of the bugs and glitches the game has, does it really take that long to do this?

Also, only to release the Showtime expansion with the singer but no compatibility with bands. 

If anyone can convince me otherwise, it's just absolutely ridiculous that the community is so vocal and active yet nothing is heard by the devs.",,False,self,t5_2rbdu,False,,

So I will answer everyone's questions about it here. Hopefully people instead of making a text post about it will go here instead (or google the legacy challenge)

**WHAT IS A LEGACY

Ah

* Create a sim. Male or female. Preferably YA. This will be your founder.

* Purchase the most expensive lot in your world. This would be the 60x60 lot next to the Landgraabs in Sunset valley.

* Your sim will only have enough simoleons to purchase a bed and a very cheap bathroom (maybe a kitchen). You can go totally homeless though

* Find a husband! Or wife! Make babies. As many babies as you want. If you're a baby addict like me you may want NRAAS's Master controller and Portrait panel. Means you can have 24 sims in a family. Babies everywhere.

* Do whatever you want
 
* When they have all aged up to YA or Teenager

* Stay in the 60x60 lot. Build it up to be a giant mansion. 

* Congratulations! You've gone throught the 1st generation. What to do next? Do what I just told you for the next **10 generations** with the next heir. Get married, choose heir, rinse and repeat. Very, VERY simple.

* Some other stuff you may want to note: DON'T USE CHEATS. Lifespan should be normal, cannot be in the sims inventory)

I just gave you the basic rules for a legacy. [HERE](http://forum.thesims3.com/jforum/posts/list/39862.page) is a very detailed guide for the legacy challenge. But, not to be seen as a chore.

**FAQ**

**Can I have a vampire/fairy/witch etc. as a heir/founder?**
Yes. Yes you can. 

**There isn't a 60x60 lot in my world!**

If you've downloaded a custom world, do whatever the hell you want.*

**Can I have pets in my legacy?**

Yes

**Uh oh! My sim got 60

When a sim gains a whole bunch of simoleons unexpectedly the most common thing a person does is buy a car. Or you can invest in properties

**My legacy is boring! Is there anything else to do?**

Yes! Theres a whole bunch of stuff to do!

[THIS IS A WONDERFUL

They live in a society where people seem more or less happy all the time despite the unusually high deathrate for such a small community. Their political structure appears to be outwardly a democracy, essentially allowing the wealthy to choose their leader

There also appears to be no organised religion in their society. Religious artefacts and churches are mysteriously absent. There is however a death cult in the form of statues of the Reaper. Mass wailing and spontaneous acts of devotion are expected at any monument where the reaper has claimed the souls of the living. It's essentially a cult of the sort that North Korea combines into its leader worship.

* Holding down the alt key will let you manipulate an object in any way you want. (Chellekat)

* Holding down the shift key while placing stairs makes them go down instead of up. (JAMIEInc)

* Entering the cheat 'resetsim name' (ex. resetsim john doe) will reset that specific sim only. (Unoimalltht)

* Entering the cheat 'resetsim *' will reset every sim in the neighborhood back to their lot. This is useful for when the game glitches. (JAMIEInc)

* While placing some wall decorations

* You can paint the ceilings. (PsychoClownBoy)

* The last speed option (the arrow with the line) is used to speed through the current task. This is helpful for sleeping

* If you are playing on the computer, ""3"" for super speed, and ""4"" to speed through the current task. (Malaria). You can hit ""0"" or ""P"" to pause the game. (Smartache)

* You can push and pull walls to make rooms bigger or smaller without having to delete everything. Simply go to build mode and hover your curser by the wall. It will show an arrow to grab to move the walls. This is super helpful for quickly making any room just a bit bigger once you have more money without having to redo the whole house. (Hrnmyd)

* You can make a kid/teen dream while sleeping. This will put them in a better mood. (Nikashin).

* You can delete trees and decorations in the neighborhoods by going to the edit town mode. This makes it easier to make room for lots. (Nikashin)

* You can change the heights of roofs seperately. This can be done by clicking the button next to the ""remove all roofs"" option. (Nms12457)

* You can drag entire color palettes from one object to another. (SaebraK)

* You can use a sprinkler to water your garden. (InimitableAlacrity)

Here are some other tips and tricks I found on the internet

* You can drag plates/trash to the dishwasher/trash instead of having your Sim do it. Just click and hold on the item and drag it to its respective place. This saves a lot of time.

* The same is true for putting leftovers in the fridge. If you forget to have the Sim put leftovers in the fridge

* Your Sim will learn a skill faster if they are in a better mood.

* If you hold down shift while moving the camera

* Use the sledgehammer tool to get rid of dead plants. It will sell them instead of having your Sim throw it away

* Having your Sim give birth at home will give their relationship a better start.

* Watching KidZone on TV or kids music will increase your Sim’s probability of having twins or triplets (if you don’t have the reward already).

* Your Sim can ignore phone calls by clicking the phone in their inventory and selecting to ignore the phone cal. You can also put the phone on silent (or change the ringtone).

* Sim’s paintings are worth a lot more after they die. (This will give me something to do with my Sim’s when they retire…)

* If a pregnant Sim eats 3 apples (one after another)

* If a pregnant Sim eats 3 watermelons (one after another)

* You can put a radio/boom box on the edge of some hot tubs.

* The rubber duck you buy at the store can also be put on the side of some tubs for an extra moodlet.

1358085385.0,16hop6,How to put a basement under existing foundations the easy way.,NoodleGlue,142,19,14,"My daughter and I had recently been struggling with how to put a basement into an existing house with a foundation - and more specifically putting in the stairs. This proved immensely counter intuitive - with articles on the net talking about cheats or small steps down to foundation level...

None of which seemed to work. I eventually discovered how to do this correctly using just two steps. No cheats. No clever tricks. Hopefully this will save some of the rest of you the hassle.

Before we start it's important to talk about the three levels.
1. The basement level - created using the Basement tool in build mode for your house.
2. The foundation level - the area which looks like grass under your house.
3. The ground floor level - the level your sims walk around on.

Okay - so here is how you do this:
1. Use the Basement tool in the build mode for your house to add the basement. You add this by going to the foundation level and dragging out the basement shape.
2. Go to the ground floor level above the basement and select the stairs you want. Do NOT delete any floor squares (the things your Sim walks on) - doing this will cause you to create a small stair case to the foundation level. You'll notice that by default stairs try to go up. Holding shift will cause them to go down - and suddenly your stairs will go though the floor squares and the foundation to the basement below. This works for spiral staircases too.

Magic. It's that easy. Two rules to remember - don't delete ANYTHING and create the stairs at the ground floor level (holding Shift to go down).

Hope this helps anyone.

Edit: Thank you for your kind words. I'm glad I'm not the only one that had trouble with this!",self,t5_2rbdu,1358108303.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/comments/16hop6/how_to_put_a_basement_under_existing_foundations/
