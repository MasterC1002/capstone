Quick note to the mods: Apologies to the mods for this spam - but I have to run through the halls screaming this I'm so excited about it.  :)

As many of you know, and am a husband and father of two kids under 3 (one of which was born during the last year... hence a slower than normal dev rate on the site).  The work load has been a bit more than I've been able to keep up with lately.  I haven't been able to improve PCPartPicker as well as I'd like.  That is about to change.

I turned in my two-week notice last week, but now I'll have even more time to dedicate to everything.

Know that I listen closely to your feedback, but you can also PM me here on Reddit.

I look forward to further serving this community.  I've got some killer features in the pipeline that I can't wait to show everyone.  The best is yet to come!

Cheers

It occurred to me that there really wasn't any reason that  could think of that he couldn't build a computer of his own.  I've already outfitted a netbook with Sugar (OLPC) on it for his amusement

The following are the rules for the build:

1)  Each week
2)  We decide together what part we'll need for the week (i.e. case
3)  When we get to the store
4)  We pay for it and head to Chick-fil-A (his favorite place to eat).
5)  When we get home

So far

*  Case:  Cooler Master HAF 912 case.  He originally wanted to go for one of those bright red plastic deals

*  Case fans:  2 x 120 mm.  One is a Xigmatek, have LEDs on them... he insisted that one be red and the other blue.  Cost:  $40 ($20 each)

*  DVD-ROM drive.  For some reason he insisted that he get one on week 3 and also insisted on the cheapest one available.  I'm not complaining.  Cost:  $18

*  Power supply:  Thermaltake TR500 PSU.  He was surprisingly adamant that this was the one despite the fact that I couldn't see anything particularly exciting about it that would catch his eye.  Cost:  $43.

So, I'll keep updating as more as we continue.

AN UPDATE (5/26/13):  We're still working on the project, and this week he got himself a card reader for one of the little drive bays.  Somehow, he lost a pair of tweezers in the case during the card reader installation, but we expect they'll turn up somewhere.",,False,,1369580693.0,t3_1egh9u

**Building a Gaming PC**

---

Well, as I will be talking in terms of specific parts and narrowing your choices down. Ive been meaning to write it for a while, but with the 100k subscriber competition on /r/buildapc going on I may as well do it now and have a chance of winning. Good luck to you all if you are entering.

It can be rather intimidating to have a whole pcpartpicker list of CPUs, at least for gaming PCs.

The first thing you will want to consider is the *budget*

---

**CPUs**

---

**[A8-5600K](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/amd-cpu-ad560kwohjbox)/[A10-5800K](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/amd-cpu-ad580kwohjbox)** For the very low budgets, on the FM2 socket.

**[G630](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80623g630)/[G850](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80623g850)** Now an APU build can easily go up in price until you can get an Intel Pentium G630 processor and a low end GPU like a 7770. At that point

**[FX-6300](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/amd-cpu-fd6300wmhkbox)/[i3-3220](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80637i33220)** Heres where the ""good"" category gaming builds come in where you can start to enjoy 60fps @ 1080p in most games. At this price point there is the i3-3220 and FX-6300 from Intel and AMD respectively. At the moment these are very competitively priced and either is a good choice

**[i5-3470](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80637i53470)** Not overclocking? Want to spend more on the GPU? This is a very good choice of CPU for a mid-high end gaming rig. More performance than you will need for general gaming so you are set for quite a while to come

**[i5-3570k](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80637i53570k)** A /r/buildapc favourite right here. For good reason too. I see it recommended a little too much for people who clearly have no interest in overclocking though. If you do want to overclock

**[i7-3820](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80619i73820)** Why skip the i7-3770k? Well [Ive discussed this topic in a lot of detail here](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/164qx0/psa_i73820_the_x79_chipset_and_gaming/) so I won't go into it. The only benefit of an i7-3770k over an i5-3570k is the hyperthreading which games don't take advantage of

**[FX-8350](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/amd-cpu-fd8350frhkbox)** sits below the i5 in terms of gaming performance but is very good for streaming and multi threaded tasks where the extra cores come in handy. Just don't bring up Logan's video to use in an argument for it :D

---

**CPU Coolers**

---

Not overclocking? Don't want insane quiet operation? **Use the stock cooler**. The exception to this is the i7-3820 - as it is an enthusiast CPU there is no stock cooler bundled with it.

For moderate overclocking a [**Cooler Master 212 Evo**](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/cooler-master-cpu-cooler-rr212e20pkr1) will do you proud

If you really want to push things and already have a higher end CPU selected, the [**Noctua NH-D14**](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/noctua-cpu-cooler-nhd14) and the **Thermalrite True Spirit 140**.

If the aim is silence over performance

Water cooling you say? Very expensive but it is absolutely amazing for cooling. I would only recommend it if you have already splashed out on at least an i7-3820 and dual 7970s

Oh you meant a CLC (closed loop cooler)? These are meh. You can get the same performance out of air cooling for less cost and it will be a lot quieter - the stock fans on current CLCs on the market tend to be high rpm to get good cooling temps. However there are advantages: because all the heat dissipation goes on at the radiator, as a lot of people have had issues with the software and pump grinding issues even with the new ""i"" generation.

Thermal paste - [fills the microscopic air gaps between the CPU and the heatsink base to improve heat dissipation](http://www.hardwarelogic.com/articles/guides/Thermal_Paste/Heastsink_diagram.jpg). All coolers will come with enough for a few applications

The ""TOMB"" directory still holds my original 1996 install of Tomb Raider. Civ2 is my first install of Civilization 2. TIE? That was tie fighter of course.

DLL? Oh thats something special, my old ""evil guide"" for tradewars 2002 (my favorite BBS game):

Other stuff in that folder includes old code I wrote for a MUD I had become a ""wizard"" at back in the 90's.

And hey, but here's the lyrics: [Son, be a Marine](http://i.imgur.com/RFI5W3c.jpg)

I'll keep this SFW by not sharing any vintage 1994 porn. And yeah, it's cool stuf. For example, back then I was part of a group of guys who more recently became a bit better known... Moved to California, brought my hard drive, had some good times, won't be sharing my handle: [A Mystery...](http://i.imgur.com/ZBqk8rc.jpg)

I had a similar problem when trying to find the right keyboard for my needs. My old Logitech multimedia keyboard from the 11-year-old Logitech MX Elite Duo keyboard and mouse combo lasted just as long and I was in the market for another keyboard that was both cheap, but someone had recommended a Cherry Blue mechanical keyboard that costs $130. That's $70 more than the keyboard I picked out and $50 more than my allotted budget. $50 is a lot of money and not something I can afford when I need something imminently, and while I understand that mechanical keyboards generally last longer, that's besides the point (and may not necessarily be true since I eat and drink beverages in front of my keyboard).

As a GTX 670 owner, congratulations AMD owners and fellow gamers!

That said, many posts boiling down to ""I love my GTX ..."" are being downvoted and I am not sure why!

My personal story is irrelevant to my main point, PCIe bandwidth randomly downclocking to x1 speeds requiring a restart, Skyrim experiencing abysmal flickering). I ended up getting a GTX 670 and experienced no such issues. Am I hating on AMD? No. **As a hardware junky, giving up on their 3GB of dedicated VRAM, superior bus size, and incredible GPUGPU potential was quite depressing for me.** And, as previously stated, and to be dismissed as a fanboy is insulting and demeaning

I'm pleased to announce that PCPartPicker now supports Newegg combo deals for US and Canada.

Combo deals are important when trying to find the best deals

For a given part list, prices from your preferred retailers, nearby local-only deals, promotions and coupon codes, mail-in rebates, taxes, and shipping.  The best combination of deals is presented and broken down part by part

Oh

So.. what do you guys think I should do?

Edit 5: I just did a quick refresh and I have so many messages and this is #1 on the subreddit right now. This is amazing. I know this isn't really the place to ask this question but people were telling me I shouldn't ask the people in /r/buildapcforme to build me a pc so I was wondering if anyone would be willing to get together a build so I can order it this week. I know I'm asking for a lot here but since this has gotten a lot of attention I figured I would put it here. I don't expect anyone to do it but I mean

What I'm looking for: A gaming pc between $1000-1500 (but I can maybe go a bit over if I beg a bit) where I can get at least a steady 60 fps while recording games like League of Legends, Canada, unfortunately not near a microcenter. I'd rather have the pc be quiet. I think it'll need quite a bit of USB plug ins because of the Elgato, Blue Snowball mouse and keyboard too.

To change the frequency of the RAM to what is advertised, and if not, then scroll through the different tabs until you come across an option called ""DRAM Frequency"". All you have to do is change this option to your advertised frequency (for me it was 1600HMz). Remember to save the changes before you exit and there you go, all done! :)

It's a bit over the top

Ok, etc.  For that reason, we didn't go with a custom water cooling loop given the outrageous budget.

Before anyone jumps on the (pricey) choice of RAM

Thanks go out to /u/NZXT_Retell and [NZXT](/r/nzxt) for providing the H630.  I can honestly say the case is awesome to work with.  I wanted something that was cleanly designed

Thanks also go out to /u/Jappetto

**Day 1** - I need to get my paint and disassemble my case. All of my hardware is in there so it will take some time to get that done. I am working the real job today so most of this is after hours. I refuse to be the OP that doesn't deliver and will keep updating and answering comments. Rather than keep you in the dark this whole time I'll give you guys a homework assignment for those who are serious about getting their cases painted. **Take as many pictures as possible while you take your PC apart.** Every case is different. those who kept the box and manual will be glad they did especially if that manual tells you how to take it apart. Save your screws

This will do all the daily tasks needed in a computer: web browsing, Minecraft). It also has an SSD, so it will be lightning fast in every noticeable regard. Great for parents that just need a plain 'ol computer.

So this shouldn't be anything new: an FX 6300 should do the trick for most games and it does slightly bottleneck the 760 (at least I think a 6300 would bottleneck a GPU with 670 levels of power), affordable, all around good gaming rig.

This is a great build. The 4670K should not bottleneck any card in any game for many years to come, is very overclock-friendly and is a beast at stock clocks. There's also an SSD for the OS and commonly used programs. If you want all of your games to look amazing, look no further.

Great performance all around. The 3820 is last gen's Sandy Bridge-E but it's the only one out there for LGA2011. There's an upgrade path to IVB-E but once we get to Haswell-E there will probably be a socket change. LGA 2011 allows for quad-channel memory and has more bandwidth on its PCI slots. This allows for faster and more RAM overall and also doesn't bottleneck SLI'd or xFire'd cards as much as other sockets do. Also

Ok, somewhat all-out primarily editing computer.

Ok, making it perfect for editing processes that require many threads. The SLI'd 780s have the CUDA cores mentioned above, and they're basically GTX Titans with less VRAM. That's OK though, 3 GB is still quite a lot. It should push 1440 and triple 1080p setups well. If you want a to some extent future-proof, top of the line PC, then this is for you. **EDIT** If you're primarily going to be video editing, swap the 2 780's for this:

I know a lot of you already understand these concepts, and I'll promptly delete it and most likely not post again until my self esteem has returned and I'm done crying in the fetal position. Okay.. 

In order to provide a decent understanding

I'll start with the difference between Frame Rate and Refresh Rate. Most of us are familiar with these but I've sometimes seen them mixed up or mistakenly used interchangeably. It's important to note they're not the same. 

**Frames Per Second** refers to the amount of frames/images your computer can generate per second (generally through the use of discrete graphics card). The more frames per second you are seeing, is how many frames your monitor can refresh per second. This rate is indicated through hertz.

What's important to keep in mind here is that it generally doesn't matter how many frames per second your card can generate as long as the number is equal to or above your monitor's refresh rate. Most monitors are 60hz, then it's 60hz. So if you have a 60hz monitor and your graphics card is rendering a consistent 60 fps, you're seeing the smoothest picture your setup can manage. Of course it's rarely, if ever, that perfect.

The next thing to explain is the **Frame Buffer**. To provide a crude explanation of what's going on behind the scenes, and then shortly sends it to the monitor's display. The Frame Buffer is where these images are temporarily stored (in the graphics card's VRAM) before making their way to the monitor. 

There are usually two buffered images held at any one time, the Secondary Buffer becomes the Primary Buffer (and therefore displays the image onto the screen), while what was previously the Primary Buffer becomes the Secondary Buffer and begins rendering the next image. Your graphics card does this dance as fast as possible in order to provide you with as many frames per second it can manage.

Now with a basic understanding of Frames Per Second, you should hopefully be able to understand what causes **Tearing**. An example of image Tearing can be seen [here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Tearing_%28simulated%29.jpg). Tearing is generally the result of a powerful graphics card or a very non-demanding game. It's caused when your graphics card generates more frames per second than your monitor can handle (i.e. when the FPS &gt; than your monitor's refresh rate). What happens is that your graphics card generates several images in the Frame Buffer before any one of them has been sent to your monitor, so when the image is finally sent it will actually be the result of more than one image overlapping. In other words, information regarding multiple frames will be sent to your monitor to display at once. 

Say, your view may have veered slightly to the right, so part of the image will look slightly further to the right while the other part is still straight on. The image is therefore misaligned at parts, resulting in the tearing effect.

Another way to put this is to say the graphics card and monitor have gone out of sync: the graphics card is kicking out frames faster than the monitor can display them. This is where **VSync** enters the picture. VSync literally stands for ""Vertical Synchronization."" Its job is to make sure the images vertically align

With VSync enabled, this gives you the smoothest possible image the setup can provide. So you might ask, why not always keep VSync on? Because even though it solves the issue of tearing (when your graphics card renders more frames per second than your monitor can handle), the results are drastically different when your graphics card generates frames at a rate lower than your monitor's refresh rate. In that situation, it will actually reduce your *Frame Rate* to 50% of the *Refresh Rate* (and sometimes even lower). 

This is probably the hardest concept to articulate, your monitor will be ready to display a new image slightly faster than your graphics card can generate it. There isn't a huge difference between 55 fps and 60 fps, so really the image could still look pretty smooth. Yet, with VSync enabled, your graphics card needs to wait for the signal from your monitor before generating new frames. Let's say the image in the Primary Buffer is being displayed on the screen. Your graphics card is currently rendering the next image, but again, it is slightly slower than your monitor's refresh rate. Before the graphics card has finished rendering that image, the monitor continues displaying it and restarts its refresh cycle. Even though the next image is ready to be displayed only milliseconds later, you are now getting 30 fps when you could and should be getting 55 fps. 

This is the problem with VSync. Since frame rates have a tendency to jump up and down depending on what's going on in a game, but the second you enter the game's open world area your fps drops to 50.  

One feature that can be used to help deal with this problem is **Triple Buffering**. With VSync enabled, and even if they do, Triple Buffering requires more VRAM to be dedicated to the Frame Buffer. With cards that don't have a lot of spare VRAM or games that require a good amount of it, additional performance issues can result since the card now has to balance its use of VRAM with the added demand of the extra buffer. 

Another great solution is enabling Adaptive VSync. **Adaptive VSync** basically turns VSync on for you when the frame rates are greater than the refresh rate and turns it off when the frame rates drop below the refresh rate. The caveat with this solution is that it's unfortunately limited to Nvidia users only. If you're using an Nvidia card

So yeah, please let me know if any of the explanations are offensively incorrect, or feel free to add anything I may have missed that would be helpful. 

**TL;DR:** Although there are no hard line rules, turn it on. 

And cue the comments about my inaccuracies now. 

**EDIT:** Glad to see most people are enjoying this, it's just a matter of whether the lag is long enough to be noticeable. As wtallis explains, since VSync requires the graphics card to wait for the signal from the monitor before rendering additional frames, the frames in the buffer can often become stale or old. By the time the graphics card actually renders these frames, it's likely enough time has gone by that there will be visible lag on screen. This is another problem that can be caused by VSync.

I should also note there are some other good points made below and certain things explained better and with more detail than I used

I wrote this about VSync because I feel like there just aren't many, throw out suggestions and maybe I or someone with more knowledge could do another one of these. I think it'd be a cool addition to this subreddit.  ",,False,,t5_2rnve,1356052572.0,,

**EDIT** - Just to respond to everyone offering me things: I really appreciate it, so I am not planning on taking advantage of any of your offers. I may reconsider at some point, but only if all parties understand that I am not someone who is in dire NEED of help. This whole incident is mostly a very big, very long term inconvenience to me, not something that has ruined my life or put me in a bad position, financially or otherwise.

To those asking if the system is bricked:  I don't know.  The monitored is clearly trashed. The keyboard had some keys broken off and has some mud/insulation/drywall in it.  The case is mostly fine, for data security and retrieval if possible.  The inside looked pretty decent all things considered.  My main concern is the power supply that has an intake in the top.  I expect it has a good amount of crud in it.

Ultimately though, covered in muddy rain, and then rained on again several times over the past 2 weeks.  Much of it is probably ""salvageable"" given enough time and effort, but were I to try to save absolutely everything possible, I could be sorting through things and cleaning things for several months. The alternative is saving the most important things, like sentimental items that can't be replaced, calling in someone to haul everything else away as trash, it feels wasteful,,

**The Actual Computer**    
Please turn off, make sure the floor where you plan on doing open computer surgery is clean. Then, place newspapers over where you will place your computer. This will help prevent static and some more dust from entering while cleaning as well as taking away all disadvantages of carpet.  Now, place your computer, open, on the newspapers/floor. Now, get your [Cleaning Duhicky ](http://i.imgur.com/53huU.jpg) ready. I used some sort of woman's sock attached to a shop vac on blower mode.

***Monitor:***      
Monitors are by far the easist part of your computer to clean. All you have to do is shine a light towards them to illuminate dirt, just keep rubbing the wipe on them.

1366122681.0,1cgndm,Everything you need to know about Haswell (so far). Info and FAQs.,Skandranonsg,762,116,271,"Socket and Chipset Changes:

- **Socket 1150**  
Haswell will be on the socket 1150 platform

- **USB 3.0**  
Haswell's USB controller is supposed to be able to achieve the maximum 10Gb/s that USB 3.0 promised. So far

- **PCIe Lanes**  
Haswell will not be able to run 16x/16x on PCIe 3.0. This was obvious

- **Memory**  
Haswell will continue to support dual-channel DDR3 memory. The first time we're expected to see DDR4 on desktop machines will be with Haswell-E. Haswell will natively support overclocked RAM speeds of up to 3200MHz. Why you'd need that kind of speed

Architecture Changes:

- **On-die VRM**:   
One of the biggest and most significant changes to Haswell architecture from Ivy Bridge is moving the voltage regulation module (VRM) on to the chip itself.  
What does this mean to you? Well, because you won't be at the mercy of shitty manufacturers putting low quality VRMs on your board.

- **Integrated Graphics**  
There are four new levels of integrated graphics available on various Haswell chips. GT1, and GT3e. GT1-3 are ranked in ascending order of power, with the GT3 rumored to be as powerful as an nVidia GT 650M.

- **eDram**  
eDram is basically a fourth level of cache above L3. Intel claims that it is large enough and fast enough to hold a frame buffer.  This will be available only on the GT3e platform
This means you should be getting far better performance while running on integrated graphics. How it will stack up to AMD's A-series is still up in the air

- **Unlocked Core Multiplier**  
Your maximum core multiplier has been raised from 56 to 80.  
Unless you're cooling with ln2 (liquid nitrogen)

- **Unlocked CPU Strap and Higher BCLK tolerance**  
This will allow for higher overclocks for those that like to tweak beyond the core multiplier. Ivy Bridge and Sandy Bridge were very picky about leaving the BLCK alone

- **Turbo Mode**  
Turbo mode has changed slightly. The only difference is that switching it off put you permanently at maximum turbo frequency.

- **Idling**  
Previously


FAQ

- **I'm a first time builder
That's a tough one that depends on a lot of factors. Here are a few reasons why you'd want to wait for Haswell:  
- If you are an overclocker or want to try overclocking.  
- If you are building a system that will run on integrated graphics.  
- If you need to transfer large amount of data with USB 3.0 on a regular basis.  
If you don't fall into any of these categories

- **Will there be a large performance difference for gamers between Haswell and Ivy Bridge?**  
Likely

- **What's coming after Haswell?**  
The next series of processors is going to be called Broadwell, and an increase in power efficiency.

- **What about the BGA rumors?**  
Intel briefly floated the idea of switching from LGA (land grid array) to BGA (ball grid array), Haswell's socket is LGA 1150.   
Broadwell is rumored to be on BGA

- **When can I get my hands on one?**  
The official launch date is June 2nd, Haswell's availability will be highly restricted. If you desperately want one on or near launch day, you may have to line up.

- **Will Ivy/Sandy Bridge prices drop dramatically with the launch of Haswell?**  
No. You won't ever see deep discounts in processors until they're far beyond obsolete. There is absolutely no reason Intel would give you a reason to buy an older chip.",,t5_2rnve,1366136705.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1cgndm/everything_you_need_to_know_about_haswell_so_far/

**Financial considerations when building a PC**

Building a PC is a cost effective way of obtaining a computer. By building your own computer you'll generally be able to have a much faster computer per dollar spent than if you were to buy one off the shelf in a store. The only situation where this may not be true is for extremely low budgets (&lt;$250 not including monitor, as it is often included with such computers but needs to be obtained separately if you're building your own. Of course piracy/linux are sometimes used to avoid this cost but whether or not they're appropriate depends on your needs and personal preferences. If you're dead set on building a computer on a low budget, [there are some great examples of such builds on r/buildapc](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/wlv7v/build_complete_aggressively_lowbudget_htpc_100/). 

For the rest of those interested in building their own pc, cd drive, HD, etc... If you want a gaming or high end computer, building a computer is by far the most cost-effective method of obtaining it. For additional savings, check out /r/buildapcsales and sign up for newegg and similar retailers promotions. 


**The hidden cost:Time**

I hesitated to call this a cost, be aware that it will take more time to choose parts and assemble your computer than it will if you simply order a prebuilt one online. If you don't have time to pick up a new hobby and have, building a computer might not be the wisest choice. You can cut down time in choosing parts by buying a kit from newegg or (preferred) visiting /r/buildapcforme where they will actually pick out parts and give you a link that you can order them all from. Once your stuff arrives it shouldn't take you more than saturday (maybe the sunday too) to put watch instructional videos and put it together. Check the sidebar for great information about how to actually assemble your computer.


**Computer troubleshooting/maintenance** 

One of the most time-consuming and often frustrating aspects of building a computer can be troubleshooting and maintenance. If you buy an off the shelf PC you can typically send it in and get it replaced (provided it is in warranty still). If you built your own, building a pc might not be right for you. However, you will learn valuable computer trouble shooting skills. When parts break after their warranty, you don't have to replace the entire computer (as you might with a destktop) or pay some schmuck to replace a part for you. In fact, you might even be able to make some money by being that schmuck for your friends. 

The time investment in troubleshooting is one of the main reasons why many of us will caution you against building a computer for someone you know. You will get a phone call every time they accidentally install a virus


**Can I build a computer?**

Do you have functioning hands or can you turn a screwdriver with your feet? If you answered yes you can build a computer. It might seem daunting and complicated but there aren't really that many parts and they go together in a fairly simple manner. There are thousands of videos and articles that can help you through it and a great community here at /r/buildapc and over at /r/techsupport. Building a computer is something everyone of every age can do, amirite?) and slightly above that of a $10 lego set. If you're particularly worried, find a friend who builds computers and have them come over. We love building computers so much that you practically have to force us not to come over and help. 


**Other benefits to building a PC**

You'll get to have the PC you want, they will laugh). You'll have a few hundred dollar bills to light your cigars, and most of all you'll have picked up a new hobby that will likely stimulate you intellectually. While this is far from complete, there are many more advantages to building your own pc which hopefully will show up in the comments. 



**Should I buy parts incrementally or save up then buy all at once?(Suggested by ElPanda)**

Generally, you can buy that ahead of time. Cases that are broken are generally broken in obvious ways and don't require installation of components to test. Good cases last several builds and are *less* time sensitive than CPUs, motherboards, and GPUs. With the exception of small changes, case designs don't change much over time. The same goes for case fans (but not CPU fans/heatsinks), as well as CD/DVD drives (but not as much blu-ray drives). All of these items hold their price and don't change much in format. PSUs don't change much but shouldn't be bought in advance because they have a higher failure rate and cost more than fans and DVD drives. Even the exceptional items can be picked up when sales happen, but shouldn't be bought for a build planned more ~3 months in the future. If you have a way to test a monitor (e.g. another computer, it might be good to buy it a couple weeks before your build so you can make sure it doesn't need to be returned. It sucks to have a set up computer and wait for your monitor to be RMA'd. 

That being said

**How much do I need?**

How much of a computer do you want? Do you want to play games or just surf the web?  $300-500 will build you a computer that can play older games just fine and most newer games on medium-low settings. $500 - 800 will build you a decent gaming rig that will play most games on medium-high settings and stay current for a while. Around $1000 and more you start to get into heftier computers that will be able to handle high/ultra settings in new games for a while on a single monitor. Somewhere just over that hump $1400 is where you see a lot of cookie cutter


**What about warranties and RMA's and rebates and all that confusing stuff? (Suggested in part by SirBonobo)**

Warranties on parts from good manufacturers are often awesome. Simply put, which is a fancy way for saying return. I've only ever dealt with Newegg and Amazon but they've all taken my returns, often paying for shipping and at most charging a modest restocking fee. Rebates are a devils bargain. Be aware that turning in a rebate makes it to where you can't RMA stuff (but you can still use the warranty through the manufacturer). It's best to fill out the rebates as close to the deadline as possible in case the stuff breaks within the RMA period. 


**I have an old PC
If cost is a heavy consideration, you can use that license to buy an upgrade copy of windows 7 which is cheaper. Other than that, DVD rom drives can be salvaged if they're SATA. Sometimes the PSU, HD and Case can be salvaged. When in doubt, ask the folks here. 

**I've decided to build a computer

Read [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/f3efg) from the sidebar. Then read the rest of the sidebar

**I've decided not to build a computer

Lots of websites out there will sell you a computer. I'd personally go to [newegg](http://www.newegg.com) first. They have pretty good deals on complete computers from a bunch of manufacturers

**tl;dr** Build a PC if you have more than $300 for your budget, and want to learn a new life skill. Buy a used/discounted computer if you're on an extremely small budget. If you have a lot of money and no time, it might be best to buy a premade computer. Use standoffs. 

**edit:** Thanks for all the great feedback

**edit 2** Taking a break for a bit to play some games. I'll answer questions and add stuff to this post later. 

**edit 3** At the request of several PMs and a comment or two I wrote up a guide about how to save money when building your own computer. A lot of folks felt swamped in high end builds and wanted to know how they could build on budgets. It's located [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/104ye3/how_to_save_money_when_you_buildapc/). I think this is all the guide writing I have in me for a while.

1299096378.0,fw0gw,You built a computer.  Now what?,nubbinator,710,104,111,"How to stability test a new PC, Ninite is still a great place to start for software.

**Overclocking/Stability**

Once you put your computer together

If you’re not overclocking your CPU, it has stress testing software built in.

Once you have your CPU overclocked in your BIOS or UEFI, and [Prime95]( http://files.extremeoverclocking.com/file.php?f=205) are generally considered the best stress testing suites out there.  All three will test your RAM and CPU or just your CPU.  Generally a system is not considered stable until it can run a stress test suite for several hours without crashing.  [IntelBurnTest]( http://www.xtremesystems.org/forums/showthread.php?t=197835) is another popular stress testing program.  It’s important to check your temps every 5-15 minutes for the first hour or so of stress testing to make sure that your temps aren’t getting too high as too much heat can damage and shorten the life of your components.  Your system should shut itself down if temps go too high, but keeping your eye on it at the start also will let you know if you haven't mounted your heatsink correctly.

GPU overclocking has also become quite the norm.  Most GPUs should come with software to let you overclock, I’d start with [MSI Afterburner]( http://event.msi.com/vga/afterburner/download.htm), [EVGA Precision]( http://www.evga.com/precision/), [EVGA OC Scanner](http://www.evga.com/articles/00530/ ), [EVGA ELEET](http://www.evga.com/eleet/), and [Asus GPU Tweak](http://event.asus.com/vga/2012/gpu_tweak/).  For AMD, check out [MSI Afterburner]( http://event.msi.com/vga/afterburner/download.htm), [Sapphire Trixx](https://www.sapphireselectclub.com/ssc/TriXX/TriXX.aspx), Cinebench, has been throttled on some newer cards like AMD’s 6000 series of GPUs.

For checking your HDD health and benches

Lastly

**Benchmarks**

Once you get your computer setup, check out [3DMark 11]( http://www.3dmark.com/3dmark11/download/)^4, [PCMark Vantage]( http://www.futuremark.com/benchmarks/pcmarkvantage/download/)^4, [3DMark 06]( http://www.futuremark.com/benchmarks/3dmark06/download/)^4, [Cinebench]( http://www.maxon.net/products/cinebench/overview.html),  [Unigine Heaven]( http://unigine.com/download/), [HD Tune]( http://www.hdtune.com/)^4, [ATTO](http://majorgeeks.com/ATTO_Disk_Benchmark_d6359.html)

**System Tweaking**

If you’re like me

**System Info/Monitoring**

[HWMonitor]( http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/hwmonitor.html), [GPU-Z]( http://www.techpowerup.com/gpuz/), [GKRellM](http://srcbox.net/projects/gkrellm/), and [HWiNFO64](http://www.hwinfo.com/download64.html) all tell you about your system specs, components, temperatures, etc.  Of that software

To monitor your system temps, or [SpeedFan]( http://www.almico.com/speedfan.php).  Keep in mind that you have to calibrate SpeedFan (see [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/fw0gw/you_built_a_computer_now_what/c1j21q6) for more info).

**Security**

There are many different perspectivs on system security.  Personally, or [Avast]( http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download)^1.

Other useful security tools are [Keepass]( http://keepass.info/)^1 to securely manage your passwords

**Desktop Modification**

While Windows 7 looks nice, and interface.  [Rainmeter]( http://rainmeter.net/RainCMS/) and [Samurize]( http://www.samurize.com/modules/news/) are great places to start for heavily modifying the look and feel of your desktop. 

If you want a calendar on your desktop

Since the Windows key became useful in Vista, check out [Rocketdock]( http://rocketdock.com/), [ObjectDock]( http://www.stardock.com/products/objectdock/)^4, or [Launchy]( http://www.launchy.net/)^1.

[F.lux](http://stereopsis.com/flux/) changes your monitor's color temperature and brightness based on the time of day and the kind of lighting present.

**Maintenance**

In order to keep your computer running nicely, including all registry entries.  If you’re swapping out your GPU, use [Driver Sweeper]( http://phyxion.net/item/driver-sweeper.html) to get rid of all traces of your last GPU driver first.  [CCleaner]( http://www.piriform.com/)^1 is a great tool for getting rid of temp files, though it’s registry management tools are a bit more controversial.  [Franckey's System Cleanup](http://www.xs4all.nl/~franckey/franckey/software/systemcleanup.htm) is lightweight and will clean unnecessary files much like CCleaner does.  If you don’t like using Window’s built in disk defragger, [Defraggler]( http://www.piriform.com/defraggler)^1 is a great alternative.  Lastly, [Recuva]( http://www.piriform.com/recuva) is a decent place to start if you accidentally delete something.  It’s not so great if you accidentally format the wrong HDD though…

[Secunia PSI](http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scanning/personal/) and [FileHippo Update Checker](http://www.filehippo.com/updatechecker/) are great tools to make sure that your software is up to date and secure.  If the update breaks functionality or it adds adware or something else undesired, [OldVersion](http://www.oldversion.com/), or [VersionDownload](http://www.versiondownload.com/) if you can't find it.

1366391884.0,1coozd,PCPartPicker Component Price Trend Analysis,pcpartpicker,648,87,68,"Hi everyone

Just wanted to let you know of a new facet to PCPartPicker I have just pushed live:  [Price Trends](http://pcpartpicker.com/trends/).

Price trend graphs are generated daily, and average price trends.

Right now I'm generating graphs for the following categories:

* [CPUs](http://pcpartpicker.com/trends/cpu/) (broken out by popular models/sockets/families)
* [HDDs/SSDs](http://pcpartpicker.com/trends/internal-hard-drive/)
* [Memory](http://pcpartpicker.com/trends/memory/)
* [Monitors](http://pcpartpicker.com/trends/monitor/) (broken out by size and whether or not it is IPS)
* [Video Cards](http://pcpartpicker.com/trends/video-card/) (broken out by chipsets - Radeon HD 7*** and GeForce GT(X|S) 6**

Want to check whether overall RAM prices are rising or falling (hint: still rising)

The goal of these graphs is to enable you to make more informed buying decisions by showing computer hardware price patterns.  That way if you're wondering whether to buy now

And as a fun side-note

* [Holiday sales](http://i.imgur.com/UjXzmWU.png) are easy to spot.  Makes it easy to recognize if a given component class goes on sale frequently
* [Here](http://i.imgur.com/plwnB5a.png) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/zL3odrG.png) look like a retailer doing some price optimization (trying to find the best margin/volume tradeoff
* [Here](http://i.imgur.com/E13DW0i.png) is a retailer price error.  Sometimes you'll see spikes in the opposite direction

And on an unrelated side-note

Cheers

Some of you may recognise this rig as I've shown it a couple of times in various states of completion.  Only now, however, so I won't be posting there until probably October or so.

I started the process back in January, modded **a lot** of bits etc.  until today, where I can finally call this thing complete.

**Important notes on parts:**

* The AX1200 is from my old setup where I had QuadSLI 590s.  My PSU choices were also very limited at the time

* I do a lot of CUDA rendering

* The Agility 3 is also from my old setup

* I went with dual loops because... well I wanted to, I definitely think it was worth it for the dual coolant look

* The straight tubing is made from acrylic

* I'm still very much working on updating my displays etc.  Sadly I couldn't afford to pop for another 2560x1440 monitor so stuck with one of my old 1080p ones.  

* As for keyboards

* The mouse I've had for several years now.  I got to try one out in the shop and really liked both the grid button layout (very handy for application shortcuts) and the ability to change the grip style.  I have very large hands

* I will be heavily overclocking the heck out of these parts too.  Prior to switching GPUs I had my CPU running at 4.7GHz without issues at 1.38V.  I'll try to see if I can reduce that further this time around, the Titans should be much more resilient.

**[Finished Pictures!](http://imgur.com/a/ncDPj)**

**Mods Involved**

* Removed the 5.25"" bays and made a platform and backing sheet.  Placed the reservoirs there instead.

* Cut out the front fan mount to make room for the tubing

* Top 360mm rad space expanded

* Sleeved all the case

* Main tubing from bent acrylic

* White acrylic PSU shroud and Midplate

* Added 2.5"" mounts to the middle HDD cage

* Various bulkhead and fillport cutouts

* Coated the whole mobo tray in white 3M DiNoc Carbon fibre Vinyl

* Removed and painted the red RAM heatsinks

I built a new gaming PC after I got a sweet deal on a used graphics card and PSU. The graphics card in question is an MSI Twin Frozr III R6950.

I get everything together and start gaming. I'm pretty new to gaming PCs, and he had stress-tested some of them this high for 30 days straight. He had tens of thousands of dollars worth of this exact card in his supercomputing cluster, so he knew the specs pretty damned well and had a lot of money riding on not breaking them.

At some point

Again, and there is a *lot* of thermal paste. I figured maybe this was preventing any good metal-metal contact and keeping things hot. So I start scrubbing it off the GPU with a microfiber rag, and I notice a weird semicircular discoloration on the edge of the GPU's shiny metal. I figured it was maybe some kind of laser mark, so I ignore it.

After cleaning off the GPU, I find [this](http://imgur.com/a/ibe4z). 

This is some kind of sticker. I think it might be half of one of those QC stickers that Chinese factories slap on everything. The entire half-sticker was sandwiched between the GPU and heatsink

I remove the sticker and re-apply (much less) thermal paste. Where I used to be sitting at 90ºC, whereas I had seen it go into the high 90s before (presumably before it started throttling).

1. People are harassing other for not having knowledge in this field.
2. The ""cookie cutter"" builds have become (literally) the most common builds (within some small margin on parts) and people are often to stubborn to recognize other parts as quality.
3. Users WONT accept advice if it goes against the cookie cutter build.
4. Posters have trouble realizing they can't get what they want out of their money. 
5. Lots of vagueness is answered and often no gratitude towards people who give constructive advice/criticism. 
6. Almost half the posts on the Tech Tuesdays aren't fully addressed or even answered. 

My solutions to these (again

1. Be friendly, try to teach them or inform them on it and everyone is happy!
2. Be more open to other build ideas. Not everyone wants to use that ONE particular motherboard (we all know which one) so if the OP says he doesn't want it don't post how much better it is. If you really want to argue it ASK if the OP would consider it based on comparison that YOU provide. 
3. In reference to #2
4. Some people lately have asked if they can do certain things with an exact budget. Guess what, good mobo to match it, a 7970, and the other parts. Some people have had trouble acknowledging that corners need to be cut.
5. A lot of questions would be better answered with more detail and/ or more content than is now. Such as questions like ""what is different between the Gigabyte Windforce 7970 and the Saphire Vapor-X 7970
?"" Most of us would answer not much or nothing. Thank you to the people who explain the difference in the cooler design and stock OC(if applicable). 6.Lastly, but I hate going through and getting toward the bottom half of the posts and seeing only 1/3 of those getting answers. This isn't /r/Funny or /r/Pics where only the best stuff is up top, all of the questions deserve a chance to be answered as they are all equal. I try my best to answer the leftover but I don't always have time/knowledge. 

I would love to hear everyone else's opinions on this matter (agree, anything!) I just really want some of these things to be addressed because I believe it would hugely benefit this subreddit to be more user friendly and a more effective place.

Oh ya

EDIT 1: 
*So after reading over ALL of the comments (I find this matter that important) I have come to a few conclusions and I have gathered some interesting information. Before I do so, drop it. It's really that simple. This concept extends to literally every piece of hardware and every situation topic. If a user says they specifically want an AMD cpu, it's ok to recommend an Intel and state the benefits, but don't pressure them to do so. This sub is to HELP people build, not tell them what to build. 

*Transitioning into another topic, correct me if I'm wrong). A respectful response would be ""You can get a similar mobo hardware wise for less(link to it here) and a PCI wireless card (again, link) and still be under budget."" Now the OP knows exactly what his choices are and what situation he is in. If he replies that he would prefer the ASUS over another mobo, don't become and elitist and offend him. Just let it go. 

*Up next is citing your claims and giving thorough responses. If you recommend an item include a link as to why and give proper reasoning in the post as to why you find it superior. Not a ton of work and it clarifies the situation that much more. If two people disagree on something get the most relevant tests you can find, let it go.

*Anyone notice a trend? If a user gives a budget stick to it

*Another notable mention would be a revamp of the sidebar and possible the post sections(maybe a way to cycle between build ready, ect.) and more streamlined posting. The sidebar could give a better explanation of how the computer building process goes and how this sub contributes. Also, a GREAT idea (from JohnnyNoCares) to have a user voted build of the week/month. I'm not sure how it would all play out right now but it's something that would be nice if it was implemented. I liked this suggestion a lot: was to take the cookie cutter builds (say for 3-9 price ranges) and giving them their own spot (sidebar???). It could be like the logical increment guide but based off of the user voted parts/ builds and give suitable substitutes of close popularity. 

*A (final) point I noticed was ""what if someone asks for a build under $1200, that type of post should be moved to /r/buildapcforme NOT buildapc. Secondly, if you DO give them ye old Reddit special explain WHY all the parts are popular, chances are they don't know. After you've done that ask if the budget is for sure or if the OP would prefer lower/higher and work off of that.

*I would like to thank everyone that commented/is commenting with solid

**Save money with reddit

This is something everyone should do if they're planning on building a PC. /r/buildapcsales lists daily deals from a bunch of tech websites that will help you find awesome prices on good gear. The comments will help you figure out how good the deal is, and allows you too add all of your parts together while ensuring compatibility. It is hands down the best resource when building a new computer and will save you anywhere from $30-$100 on the average build. Even if you plan on just using one retailer (you can do that on the site), you still wind getting the best comparison of product ratings and prices that you'll find anywhere. aPudgyMasonManE also suggested using many companies price match policy to ensure the lowest prices from your preferred retailer. Nubbinator suggested a few other websites for finding deals as well as ways to get ahold of coupon codes through promotional newsletters and social media [in this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/104ye3/how_to_save_money_when_you_buildapc/c6aj2k8) 

**Buy used parts**

If you're on a budget, and ordering from folks online has its necessary perils but if you're really looking to save money... it's worth it. 


**Open box

Lots of sites (like newegg) have refurbished and open box items. These are often around 20% or more off, because that means you get a new piece of hardware. The one thing I won't buy refurbished is a hard drive, but that's just personal preference. Sites like newegg often offer combo deals which will save you money for buying certain combinations of items. You can check them [here](http://www.newegg.com/Special/Combo.aspx?listType=combo&amp;amp;name=Combo-Deals).

**Plan your upgrades**

A lot of folks spend more and more money on trying to future proof their computer. While there is nothing wrong with this, say ($700). In two years you can spend the remaining $500 on a new Mobo/Ram/CPU/GPU and upgrade your rig. Hardware changes rapidly, and $500 two years from now is going to buy you more computing power than you could ever afford now. In two years, your computer becomes current again and faster than it would have been had you spent $1200 now. (Those verb tenses got weird). Your PSU, case, fans, and DVD/CD-ROM drive will last multiple builds, and drop that money on the steam summer sale. You've upgraded your computer and bought a bunch of games. 



**Saving money for gaming

If you're primarily interested in gaming and on a budget, but there are generally CPUs that will fulfill all your gaming needs for around $100 bucks.  AMD has traditionally been the leader in budget gaming, but their recent bulldozer launch has been less than successful giving Intel's i3's a competitive edge. This will likely reverse itself in the future and I'm sure we'll see better cheap stuff coming out of AMD. A $100 CPU and a $200 GPU will always be a better gaming computer than a $200 CPU and a $100 GPU. For higher end builds, after you're spending ~$3-400 on your GPU it becomes worth it to invest in an intel CPU. 


**Roll back that motherboard**

What features do you need out of your computer? Make a list. How many SATA drives? How many USB ports? Do you need onboard video? Use this list to find which motherboard fulfills your needs at a low price. Make sure its ratings are good


**APUs for super budget gaming and other computer tasks**

APUs have integrated GPUs that enable you to save the money you would spend on a video card. These integrated GPUs aren't amazing, but for budget builds where not a lot of graphics power is necessary they can't be beat. 


**What not to scrimp on**

There are certain parts of your computer that you should make sure to spend money on, both of which are right around $50 bucks. It's not a lot of money, but you'll get a ton more out of these cases than you will out of bargain $30 cases. The second major place to not scrimp is in the PSU. A lot of people view PSUs as all being the same, but a good PSU will last a couple builds and has a lower chance of frying your components. Unstable voltages can make for really weird stuff happening that can be difficult to troubleshoot. If you want to save money on your PSU, the best way to do it is to avoid buying a PSU that puts out more than you need. If you're doing an APU Home theater PC (HTPC) build, there is no reason to buy a 1000W power supply. Power supply calculators as well as the wattage feature on pcpartpicker will help you estimate your power consumption needs. As far as energy efficiency, Namell pointed out that bronze is usually sufficient for most folks. The benefits of a very efficient power supply are mainly felt by those who leave their computer on all day doing intensive stuff (e.g. folding at home). In these cases you may actually save money going gold. 


**Using an old computer as a base**

Many of us have trouble saving but want to get a computer up and running. If you have access to a somewhat recent computer, if the form factor of the motherboard is not proprietary you may be able to use the case to house your new parts. You could even build your own case.... 

**Saving money on an OS/Software**

The cheapest OS out there is linux and there many amazing distros (such as Mint, upgrade copies can be installed if you own a previous license to windows XP or Vista (which you probably do if you have any computer built in the last 10 years. There is even a ""double install"" trick which can allow it to be installed fresh. If upgrade copies aren't an option, OEM versions of windows don't have as much support but are often cheaper and good for system builders. Finally, look at the different features each version of windows has and choose what is right for you. On other software, be on the lookout for student versions of stuff. CrobisauerCroney pointed out that many schools have a dreamspark or similar deal with Microsoft that gets you free visual studio and other software. If you were budgeting for software, student deals might be able to save you a lot of cash. Also, depending on your needs, gimp (instead of photoshop)


**Incremental builds**

A lot of folks want to buy parts a little at a time. Generally, Ram, CPU, GPU and hard drive all at the same time. These parts change in value the fastest. This will ensure that you don't spend more money on a a part just to have it drop in price before you don't get the chance to use it. Branislav mentioned that price alerts for incremental builders can help save a lot of money. They can be done on pcpartspicker as well as newegg.

1320632171.0,m30sm,Understanding motherboards.,ThoughtA,603,79,91,"I find that the component most people are baffled by in a computer is the motherboard.  I'm mostly writing this so I can easily link to this basic explanation

When it comes to buying a motherboard

1. Reliability.
2. Overclocking ability.
3. Compatibility.
4. Chipset.
5. Ports/plugs/slots/features.

### Reliability
Reliability is really just about doing your homework.  Find out what brands and models are trusted.  Opinions here are going to vary, and of course, ask around.

Some examples of commonly-bought brands for motherboards are MSI, ASRock, and EVGA.  Intel makes motherboards as well, but I don't really ever see anyone actually buy them.


### Overclocking Ability
Overclocking requires extra power to run to the components being OC'd.  A motherboard with sturdier parts will be able to handle more power flow stably, but that is not necessarily the case.  [As suggested by ICantSeeIt](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/m30sm/understanding_motherboards/c2xpqng), 
&gt;an easy way to get a rough idea of what sort of overclocking a board can handle is to look at the heatsinks on the motherboard's chipsets. A better heatsink will keep the chipset cooler and let you overclock higher and at higher voltages (typically). However

Keep in mind that this is just a quick way to eyeball things.  There is no replacement for proper research and feedback.

An example motherboard that overclocks well would be the ASRock Extreme3 Gen3 or ASRock Extreme4 Gen3

### Compatibility
Pretty much everything in a PC connects to the motherboard directly

* **RAM (also known as memory)**
RAM generally comes in either pairs or triplets.  This is for a reason.  Motherboards will support either double- or triple-channel RAM slots, you will not be taking full advantage of your RAM and motherboard's capabilities at all.  Most sites selling motherboards will state in the details/specs section whether it is dual- or triple-channel.  Be sure you know which it is and to buy RAM accordingly.  (Quick note: it is currently most common for people to buy dual-channel motherboards)
Additionally, make sure your memory speeds are compatible.  The current standard is DDR3.  Make sure the standards match up.  DDR2 can only fit in DDR2.  DDR3 can only fit in DDR3.  Make sure the speed, which should be listed immediately following DDR3 matches your RAM.  Usually it's 1333 or 1600, but sometimes it can be 1800, 2000, 2133, or others.

* **CPU (AKA the processor)**  This one is easy.  Just look at the CPU's supported by the motherboard.  If they share the same socket type (Intel's Sandy Bridge generation uses LGA 1155, will also state which actual CPU's are supported, ie ""Core i7 / i5 / i3 (LGA1155)"" or ""FX / Phenom II / Athlon II / Sempron 100 Series.""

* **Form Factor and Cases**  This pretty much means size and shape, and Extended ATX.  These are from smallest to largest.  Smaller motherboards can fit into smaller cases, but can't as easily offer as many features (see: ports/plugs/slots).  Extended ATX motherboards require a larger case, but can fit more on them.  Meanwhile, ATX is somewhere in between, and almost any case, unless it is a very small one

* **Power Pin** Not usually a difficult thing to match compatibly


### Chipset
~~The chipset is more or less how the CPU interacts with the RAM.  It used to be that a motherboard would have a North Bridge and a South Bridge, but not necessarily in any big way.  The Front Side Bus is the measurement of how quickly the CPU can communicate with the RAM and rest of the computer (wording taken from [Veidt's excellent post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/cw8ms/what_do_the_specifications_of_a_motherboard_mean/))~~

Balls.  The memory controller has moved from the chipset to the CPU.  Now the CPU determines what memory is compatible, so that defines its memory compatibility as well.  The chipset is now just how the CPU communicates with the computer.

For example, but it might not be necessary to get it.  If all else is equal, including price, definitely go with the newer chipset.  Just keep in mind that the advantages of the Z68 are not necessarily going to affect you in any real way.

* **SSD Caching** If you have an SSD, if the OS is on a HDD, will allow the computer to use a SSD as a cache.  This is better than a OS simply running on a HDD with no SSD involved whatsoever, but if you have a SSD and your OS is on your HDD, you're doing it wrong.

* **Transcoding** If you're going to be transcoding video a lot

* **Integrated graphics**  The Z68 also supports integrated graphics processing

If a Z68 board costs more than an equivalent P67 board

When comparing chipsets

### Ports/Plugs/Slots/Features

This comes down to preference.  There are many difference things to plug into different things.  I'll list a bunch here and explain what each is and why (if) it matters.  Figure out what all you'll need/want and make sure your prospective motherboard has them or you can get an adapter to plug into your computer (make sure you can plug the adapter in then instead).

* **PCI slots (AKA expansion slots)**  This might get a bit confusing.  Try to stay with me here.  There are varying generations of PCI slots.  PCI Express (PCI-E) is the current standard, so for the purposes of upgradability, you might want to get a board that has one or two of those slots, but I wouldn't sweat it too much just yet.  Anyway, different expansion cards require different expansions slots in order to function properly at their intended speed.  You want to put a GPU into a PCI-E 2.0 x16 slot.  If you plan on using SLI/Crossfire, you'll want to find out if, when you plug both GPU's in, then throwing those babies into dual/triple/quadruple mode isn't gonna help as much as it could.  If I'm not mistaken, T.V. tuners, please feel free

* **PATA Support**  PATA is the old standard for storage support.  If you have some old piece of hardware that you will want to use with your computer and is PATA only

Had to buy a few SATA III and DVI cables and whatnot as part of the build, it's worth it.  The four 3TB Barracudas are in RAID 10.  i7 3930K is currently at 4.2 GHz with a *lot* of overclocking headroom.

____

**My claim** in this post is as follows: The video from the ""It's time to rethink EVERTHING."" post (which can be found here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu8Sekdb-IE) is an example of horrible journalism and factual inaccuracy. It should be taken with two grains and a tablespoon of salt.

____

**My ground** for saying so is this:
If an AMD CPU can get you 100FPS in a game and an Intel CPU can get you 170FPS they will still look equal if the graphics card used in the test can only render 90FPS. Then you get results like this: http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/fx-8350-vishera-review

The review in the video shows similar results (they're pretty equal).

___

**My rebuttal** in this toulmin-based argument is as follows:

The video review as well as the test

____


**My warrant** in this argument is as follows:

If, so that the graphics card does no longer limit the framerate, a test will accurately show the relative performance of the CPUs.

___

**My data** to back this warrant is this:


**Link 1: (cinebench)**

http://hothardware.com/Reviews/AMD-FX-8350-Vishera-8Core-CPU-Review/?page=7

Notice how the multithreaded performance of the two chips are relatively close

This goes to show that a program, Intel usually wins.

**Link 2 (gaming):**

http://hothardware.com/Reviews/AMD-FX-8350-Vishera-8Core-CPU-Review/?page=8

Notice how the actual performance difference is visible in the test
**Also notice** how this test show the potential number of frames per second

That the test in the video shows Crysis to render less than 50FPS is proof that the test is GPU limited and that you're looking at this kind of landscape:
http://www.guru3d.com/articles_pages/amd_fx_8350_processor_review

**Notice** how in the Far Cry 2 test

When the resolution is bumped to FULL HD

____

**My final blow to the credibility of the video** is this:

The graphics card used in the video review is an HD7870. This is a card that can render 88FPS in Guru3d's test in Full HD resolution:
http://www.guru3d.com/articles_pages/amd_radeon_hd_7850_and_7870_review

Since we have just shown that the AMD FX-8350 is capable of getting 100FPS at those settings (provided you use a fast enough graphics card)

Some games are more CPU-reliant - in those games



____

**My conclusion** in this post is that the video review is completely unreliable. If you're playing video games, you're still MUCH better off with an Intel Core i5 CPU than an 8-core AMD FX.

If you're not using a super fast graphics card

This does not make AMD CPUs worse than Intel - in fact

____

**TL;DR: (Or the short explanation if you will)** If his test is limited by the CPU
http://www.guru3d.com/articles_pages/amd_phenom_x4_945_and_955be_processor_review|test

This alone should be enough to dismiss the video. For another couple of arguments and technical details

**EDIT**: Thanks for all of the comments and advice

1. Sound dampening foam with a sticky side to place inside the case.  I will probably do the two inner sides and the bottom of the lid.  Possibly other smaller areas if I find it helpful.

2. A ground wire from i/o shield to psu. I'm not sure how risky it is not to do this

3. Cpu cooler so that i can overclock. I am thinking something like the [Noctua NH-U12P SE2](http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835608024) since i care about quietness and i have clearance of 18cm for a big cooler. I'm still **very** open to suggestions on this choice...

4. Possibly taking advantage of [this deal on the HIS 7870 IceQ](http://www.memoryexpress.com/Products/MX39013) to optimize quieter living room gameplay and giving my current XFX 7870 core edition to my gf's pc.

1372032698.0,1gxqya,[Guide] How to use PCPartPicker,Repealer,623,129,150,"EDIT2: SELECT YOUR COUNTRY IN THE TOP RIGHT FIRST

EDIT3: A new guide sometime soon on picking everything CPU related. CPU and cpu cooler etc. 

**EDIT4: MUAHHAHA MY PLAN WAS A SUCCESS! Thanks for the gold /u/pcpartpicker**

So, most of use a website called PCpartpicker.com. It has a lot of great features which we’ll go into detail with, and also provides easy ways to get your content onto reddit.

To begin

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/JtEymCu.png)

Click the big gold button

[here](http://i.imgur.com/JUB3Fov.png)

From there

You should see something like this

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/BkySEAL.png)

Now, so AMD will be at the top and intel will be down near the bottom. To rectify this, you should look on the right and notice the panel titled “Manufacturer” from here, select intel or AMD to filter your results. Since mama said go intel or get the fuck out, we’re building intel. After selecting intel, we want to choose the family of processers or the series of processors. The newest family of intel CPU’s is haswell, and before that were sandy bridge and ivy bridge. If you have no preference for age and prefer series

Once you’ve picked your processor

[here](http://i.imgur.com/2zBOZqL.jpg)

From there you can see more stats about the part etc as well as prices and deals. Select “add to parts list” and bam

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/WEfK7BV.png)

Notice how the CPU is now in the slot? This is great as now that part is “locked in” ready for posting to reddit. You can change the part or remove/buy the part at any time. Now that that hard bit of picking our first part is chosen, pcpartpicker has a “compatibility filter” that doesn’t show things that are totally incompatible. Sometimes things are “semi-compatible” aka, the GPU has a very short clearance inside of the case, or the motherboard doesn’t have enough ports or the powersupply doesn’t have enough cables for you to use. This is shown below)

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/HsnieKQ.png)

If this happens

After a hard day of slogging it out and picking all the ~~best parts~~ most expensive parts for your shiny new pc

[here](http://i.imgur.com/da13K4E.png)

Pretty fancy right? Now
The other highlighted bit is the estimated wattage. This’ll tell you roughly how much watts your PSU will need to be. Generally speaking

The final highlighted bit is the “compatibility”, it’ll be red. If it’s red, scroll down until you see what the hell your stupid ass was thinking, and how to fix it.

Now

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/FX2CrBn.png)

While it looks like a t-rex had a seizure on your keyboard

For the title something like this:

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/MDKcOYK.png)

Should suffice. Only the “[build ready] is really needed. Past that make sure to insult the mods and say reddit is shit anyway and you’re going to start your own reddit with blackjack and hookers.

EDIT: /u/fp4 's tips:

Other tips:

* Un-check the Mail in Rebate box on the Price Filter box when select a component if you don't plan to use them.
* Customize the Merchant list to only display prices from Merchants you plan to use.
* Verify that the price you're expecting is the same on the website
* Shipping costs aren't always calculated in the total

Some quick links/filters I like:

* [4 GB of RAM sorted by Price](http://pcpartpicker.com/parts/memory/#sort=a8&amp;qq=1&amp;z=4096) - Cheapest 4 GB.
* [8 GB of RAM sorted by $/GB](http://pcpartpicker.com/parts/memory/#z=8192&amp;sort=a6&amp;qq=1) - For determining the cheapest way to get 8 GB.
* [8 and 16 GB of RAM sorted by $/GB](http://pcpartpicker.com/parts/memory/#sort=a6&amp;qq=1&amp;z=16384
* [SSDs between 65 and 128 GB sorted by $/GB.](http://pcpartpicker.com/parts/internal-hard-drive/#s=65000&amp;qq=1&amp;t=0&amp;sort=a6)
* [All SSDs sorted by $/GB](http://pcpartpicker.com/parts/internal-hard-drive/#qq=1&amp;t=0&amp;sort=a6) - Useful for determining if it would be cheaper to get 2x SSDs instead of 1x SSD of comparable capacity.

Was quite pleasantly surprised with SSD/Win8 Boot time. Thought I'd post up a [video!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib1m1LzQI2c&amp;list=UUpf6VFpmGIwS5honCqcj44A&amp;index=1)

1347200939.0,zloz8,You should know how to keep your PC up to date,Smartz13,647,178,172,"I found this out the other day after watching a [Linus video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhSvR4IrR44) about Ninite. I downloaded my Ninite script and set it up through Windows task scheduler to have it run every time I log on to make sure all my essential programs are up to date.

First what is Ninite? Ninite is a script that you download that checks programs you have selected and sees if you have them installed on your computer. If you don't Ninite will install them. If you do have them Ninite will check to see if there is a newer version. If there is not Ninite will skip the program.

Does Ninite skip all the toolbars and such? Yes Ninite automatically selects no on the ""add-ons"". Ninite will also make sure it downloads the correct version for your system. So if you have a 64-bit system Ninite will download both the 32-bit java and the 64-bit java.

Now


* Step 1: Go to [Ninite.com](http://ninite.com). You will get to a website that looks something like [this](http://imgur.com/uoq5b)


* Step 2: [Select your essential programs](http://imgur.com/LLZPI) such as your web browsers, your file sharing programs, etc.


* Step 3: Click the [get installer](http://imgur.com/GAuE7) down at the bottom

* Step 4: Drag the script to [your desktop](http://imgur.com/CPsFG) or some file location. Remember this location as this will be critical in the later parts of setting up the task.

* Step 5: Open [up start](http://imgur.com/iCU6K) and search for [""task scheduler""](http://imgur.com/6JJps) and click it.

* Step 6: Click on [basic task](http://imgur.com/e4VCu) in the window.

* Step 7: Put in name for the task and a description. Click next.

* Step 8: Put in a trigger. Basically do you want it to run daily? When you log on? Weekly? Click next.

* Step 9: After selecting a trigger select start a program.

* Step 10: Put in the file location for the Ninite script. Click next and then finish. Your computer is now up to date.

What I ended up buying was the [Asus PA248Q](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=24-236-287).  The panel inside is the same as the one in the highly-regarded Dell U2412M

It came yesterday, no backlight flickering or bleeding, etc.).  But almost immediately, I could tell that the color on this thing was something different.

So I decided to take some movie stills and then photograph both screens for comparison.  Obviously these aren't *directly* representative of the difference, and 2) you're probably viewing this on a TN monitor, which makes it kind of like running HDTV ads on an SD screen.  But the *relative* difference should be pretty clear.

http://imgur.com/a/QVfKO#0

Honestly

---

Of course, I don't really play twitch shooters - but I threw Bastion and TF2 at it, and subjectively it felt as smooth and responsive as any TN panel I've ever played on.

Now, so other models may be a bit worse in this area.  Still, since I had *no* issue with this panel's responsiveness, I definitely wouldn't blacklist IPS for gaming use.  It's just a factor to keep in mind as you do your own research and account for your own needs.

It seems to me that buying an IPS panel is sort of like buying an SSD.  No you don't strictly *need* it, I highly recommend picking one up](http://i.imgur.com/AithV42.png).",,False,,t5_2rnve,False,,

You guys remember my guide that won the 100k guide competition right? Well I have finally finished it for you guys. It's a couple weeks later than I planned but towards the end of last month I had a bunch of friends and family in and out of the hospital so I had to push my deadline back. Thank you for your patience and for the enormous support that the shortened version received. The full version of my guide is 106 pages long and explains what overclocking is

I'm hoping to release the guide completely by the end of the month so I'm looking for some people to read through it and point out any mistakes I have made whether it be in content or grammar. I just want to make sure that everything is right before I put it out there for everyone.

Aww yeah. I'm pretty happy with my first build! Feeling very accomplished. I went with a mATX build because I plan on bringing it around every so often to friends' houses or gaming nights at school.

I learned a bunch of things about computers and the computing community on the way. 

Some bad

* **The ""PC Master Race"" mentality irks me**

This is what I learned almost instantly. I've been always both a console and PC gamer for a while now (I still have my Atari 2600/Sega Genesis

I enjoy consoles mostly for ""hey-we're-all-on-the-same-sofa multiplayer"" games like Super Smash Bros, etc.

I enjoy computers mostly for ""hey-one-person-per-battlestation multiplayer"" games like League of Legends, etc.

This ""PC vs Console"" thing has been going on for a long time, psssh, just build a PC!"", sometimes followed by some berating/degrading remark about consoles, then followed by something about cost, games, sales, ""It's an investment""

The guys who participate in the PC vs Console make *everyone* look bad. Once I got deep into the PC community (where people discuss different computer parts and whatnot)

* **It's not *that* easy as putting together Lego pieces (as a first-timer)**

People always said this, but everything else is a bit harder. 

I did day after day research for several weeks, motherboard, etc info. I had my laptop open with a bunch of Newegg videos, and all of my user manuals open all around me. It took me at about 3-4 hours to put it together, with a couple errors here and there. Then another 4-5 hours of getting the OC, drivers, software up and running correctly, fans, but I'm not willing to spend that much (saving money is one of the reasons of this computer).

There's a whooole lot of time you need to invest in this to make sure you do everything correctly, learning what fits with what in what next to what with this much what, and so on. Man. That leads me into...

* **I hate acronyms and fancy product names**

Why couldn't they have named it Awesome GPU 1, etc.? It's embarrassing for me to say the specs of a computer. It all just so overly complicated for no reason other than to sound cool and hip and high tech-y, in my opinion.


* **Building a desktop PC is rewarding**

It feels *sooo* good when you short that circuit and seeing all the fans whirr up. All of the knowledge you gained, all of it goes into that one moment. Makes you feel like a pro that knows what he/she is doing! And then seeing it all work after putting it in your shiny new case... hnnnnngh. Now I treat my computer like a little baby. Your computer is to you as a car is to a car person.

* **Almost everything about a desktop PC is great**

Pretty much it's all been beat to death about the cost, etc. I can do my homework and play nice games whenever I want (just as long as I'm home). Maybe the only downsides are that it's not *as* portable and convenient as a console (I bring my 360slim/Wii around a lot). If I wanted portability or convenience in a PC, I would need to spend additional money for a laptop, a smaller case, a pre-built computer, or to hire someone. Pros and cons to everything!

Just wanted to give you all a quick update on some recent features and functionality I've added to PCPartPicker.

* **Parametric Price Alerts** - These just rolled out literally a few minutes ago.  What they allow you to do is set a price alert on any part category with filters.  Essentially you can set a price alert using any filter settings for the part category views.  Wanted to set a price alert on all 7200RPM 1TB hard drives? Or on all Radeon HD 7970 video cards? How about any RAM modules that are DDR3-1600+, but these respect your merchant selections, configured tax rates, and local-only deal preferences.
* **Updates to regular price alerts** - Similar to the parametric alerts
* **Part category filter tweaks** - Now when you view a part category page
* **Discussion Forums** - PCPartPicker now has [forums](http://pcpartpicker.com/forums), and syntax/markdown similar to Reddit.  BuildAPC is fantastic, and I'm not trying to divert any people from here.  However, a growing portion of visitors are not from Reddit and have been requesting this.

I've added several part categories over the last month.  Though these have been posted by others

Well guys


I mean

The SSD is probably the best upgrade you can make to any system.  Neglecting the SSD in a build is like neglecting your hot girlfriend when she offers you the best blow job in the world but you settle for a fucking fleshlight. EVERYONE has hot girlfriends bro

**edit:** It's not just boot times/shut down times. SSDs are quiet

Plus, 128gb is reasonable enough without all that music and movie junk. You can always push off certain games you're not playing on a standard HDD if it sees little to no benefit with faster load times. For example, Sims 3 would most benefit on a SSD, and open-world games such as WoW. So depending on a game, SSDs do have a big impact... 8GB of memory is not hard to come by at $40 for their performance, why is $80 so much harder to come by?

You'll notice that this build is currently lacking 8 SATA ports. Since I'm starting out with 5 drives + 1 OS I don't need the full 16 ports. Some time next year when it's time to add 2 or 3 new drives I'll need to look into a RAID controller that has JBOD support (the RAID actually will not be used). Any 2 port SAS card should work (1 SAS port will connect 4 SATA drives). My initial research shows I should budget $100-$300 for this but I'll need to look into which card when the time comes.

If you are using hot swap bays then maxing your 5.25"" case bays is a must. It took me a while to find a case with at least 9 bays that didn't look terribad. Most cases these days are being made with HDD racks integrated directly into the case underneath 2 to 4 5.25"" bays. This makes finding a top-to bottom bay case an increasing rarity these days. The case I bought was even discontinued.


#**Software**

* Ubuntu 12.04 (Free) for the OS
* FlexRAID ($50) for managing the drives

What's FlexRAID you ask? It's basically a quasi-RAID 5 / 6 in the sense that you add 1 or 2 (or more) extra disks to your array in exchange for parity on your files. You can basically lose as many drives as you have parity drives and still retain 100% of your data. Unlike a traditional RAID, which is great for a headless system.

There are a lot of software solutions out there that do similar things (Unraid

There's a lot that goes into making a good mouse

* DPI - Dots per inch - Basically, and moves the cursor accordingly. The more DPI you have, the less movement is required to move the cursor the same amount. 

* Acceleration - If a mouse has acceleration, let's say if I move my move one inch in one second, the cursor will move 500 pixels. With acceleration, if I move my mouse one inch in half a second, the cursor may move 750 pixels. Some people like acceleration, others don't. If your mouse comes with this feature, there is usually a way to enable/disable it.

* Polling Rate/Response time- The polling rate for a mouse is how many times per second it sends information to your computer. A 1000Hz polling rate will send 1000 updates to your computer per second. This means your mouse has a 1ms response time

* Lift/Liftoff Distance - This is the distance that your mouse will continue to work when lifted off the surface. Both optical and laser mice use some sort of light to track your movement. When lifted off of a surface

What to look for in a gaming mouse:

* High DPI and the ability to switch between different DPI settings - a high DPI allows for quick and precise movement while gaming. The ability to quickly change your DPI settings allow you to be more accurate when you need to be, some mice can go up to 5000 DPI or more.

* Customizable buttons - A lot of gaming mice have extra buttons you can program to do whatever you want. Some mice only have one or two buttons

* Wireless vs. Wired - This almost comes down to personal preference, there isn't any advantage to using a PS/2 mouse over a USB mouse. Most mice today are USB mice. 

* Response Time - Generally, this is frowned upon, as you can't react as fast with longer response times. 

Minor points:

* Profile saving - Some mice can save your settings directly to the mouse for quick access. You may have an FPS setting, so you don't need to open up a program every time you want to change a bunch of settings. 

* Surface - If you're going to be spending $50-100 on a mouse, but that discussion is for another thread. 

* Braided Cable - Most gaming mice today come with a braided cable. This ensures that your cable won't get tangled up. Non-braided cables are usually fine

* Ergonomic Design - This means that the shape of the mouse is designed to fit your palm. The is generally good for palm grippers (see below)

* Laser vs. Optical - There are certain people who swear by laser mice

So with the plethora of mice on the market

Everyone holds their mouse differently. However

**-=MOUSE GRIPS=-**

[**PALM GRIP**](http://assets.razerzone.com/peripherals-guide/mouse/images/palmgrip-illus01.jpg)

The palm grip is the most common of the three grips. It entails laying your entire hand on the mouse, pinky, and sometimes the ring finger. Palm grippers use the the length of their index and middle finger to press the left and right mouse buttons respectively. The mouse is mostly moved with the arm. Due to this, palm grippers generally have the least amount of stress on their hands.

[**CLAW GRIP**](http://assets.razerzone.com/peripherals-guide/mouse/images/clawgrip.jpg)

The claw grip is similar to the palm grip, and only the fingertips are in contact with the mouse buttons. The base of the mouse is stabilized by being nested the user's palm. This grip usually allows for faster clicking than the palm grip, since you only need to press with the tips of our finger rather than the whole thing. However, this will increase the amount of stress on the hand. With the claw grip, the mouse movement is also majorly with the arm. 

[**FINGERTIP GRIP**](http://assets.razerzone.com/peripherals-guide/mouse/images/fingertip-illus01.jpg)

The fingertip grip is ""the primary grip style for game play"". There are only five contact points on the mouse - the fingertips. This grip generally allows for the quickest movement of the mouse, rather than moving the mouse with the arm, it is pushed with the fingertips.

Now that you know what kind of grip you use

**Price of the mouse may change. I'm going by an average of the retail value and the price at the time of posting.**

127 mm/5.00” x 70 mm/2.76” x 44 mm/1.73”

Probably one of the most popular mice out there. It has an optical max 3500 DPI sensor, and is said to be the best palm grip mouse. It has DPI settings of 450/900/1800/3500 DPI. [~~I don't believe there is software to pick a DPI between two of the settings, which is disappointing.~~](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/xorix/rbuildapc_lets_talk_gaming_mice/c5oaaz9)

**[Logitech G9x](http://www.logitech.com/en-us/mice-pointers/mice/g9x-laser-mouse)** - [$70](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/logitech-mouse-910001152) 

108mm/4.25"" x 73mm/2.87"" × 35mm/1.38""

This is another popular mouse, so you can set a different color for different profiles. The G9x comes with two grips - a precision one and a wide grip one. The dimensions above are for the precision grip, the wide grip makes it 82mm/3.23"" wide. It also comes with weight adjustments, where the user can add up to 28g of weight to the mouse. There are also two scrolling settings - notched and smooth.

I couldn't find any dimensions online. 

Did I say the G9x was customizable? It's nothing compared to the R.A.T. 7. With this mouse, this mouse can fit your hand! You can also adjust the weight - up to five 6g weights can be added. The mouse has 3 profile settings that you can easily  switch between. The R.A.T. 7 has a ""precision aim"" function which changes your DPI at the push of a button. This mouse can have DPI settings of anywhere from 25 to 6400 DPI.

The R.A.T. 9 is just a variation of the 7 that has a wireless option. Though it does cost $15-20 more. 

There is also an [MMO version](http://www.cyborggaming.com/fr/prod/mmo.htm) of the R.A.T. 7.

**Description**

Since I have no idea how to work PcPartPicker [here](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B2x0QMMiCsAwOHhlNHRLaVhUSEU) is a complete breakdown of prices in Google docs. 
**The CPU and PSU were bought in bundles which included parts I am not using. So I filled in the average price.**


Total price is about $2500. (A few items are missing from the list)

I started out with an [NZXT Technologies Source 210](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005869A7K/ref=s9_simh_gw_p147_d0_i1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_r=0CE2V50G0VTHNS417KEH&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=1389517282&amp;pf_rd_i=507846) and cut it to the bare minimum. Everything was done by hand so it's not perfect. Each panel was made of 3 layers

It runs Battlefield 3 maxed out with CPU at ~52C and the GPU's at ~ 42C. At idle everything is 30-35C.

1349362002.0,10xrf0,"r/buildapc, I want to tell you about the experience I had at Best Buy yesterday. (tldr Matched New Egg, Free Shipping)",absolut696,526,185

I walked into my local BB with a list of computer components for a PC I am building.  I had a pretty good amount of store credit with Best Buy, wandered around and an employee saw me (he ended up being the manager), and he helped me put together an order with my list, not only that but I was telling him how I was buying some components on New Egg, so he checked New Egg to make sure I was getting competitive prices, and not only that but he made sure I was getting free shipping on anything that wasn't in the store. On top of that he went through my New Egg list and price matched anything they had in stock or could be delivered to me (also free shipping).

I know Best Buy get's a bad rap, which was just basic peripherals and a PSU.  It was such a good experience that I really feel like I should contact someone in corporate at Best Buy to tell them how good of a job the guy did taking care of me.

If there is a lesson learned, good customer service can go a long way.  Not only that, but I think with the free shipping and price matching Best Buy was the way to go in my case.

I recently had to send back two items: one to Amazon

Newegg: I had a defective video card that cost me north of $300 and I started the RMA process.  Newegg offered to sell me a USPS shipping label for $12.  I opted to go ahead and mail it USPS since I would be paying for it anyway, which brings me to the second point: you have to wait for them to receive your return before they mail you back a new item.  So, now I have to wait probably two weeks minimum to get the video card I ordered back in December.  I chose to email support from Newegg about this whole deal, and they offered to reimburse shipping.  After about 15 emails back and forth because their automated system breaks if you have to change your account email (the one I had was changed to a forward a couple years ago), they offered to pay return shipping.  Once the RMA is closed.  I still have to wait two weeks to get my video card.

Amazon: My wife ordered a USB hard drive for a friend, when it got there, it would never detect no matter what cable, port, or pc was used.  I went into my Amazon account, clicked return, and it gave me *free* shipping label

**Edit 4:** I've changed my mind a lot about what parts to use since I got a lot of wonderful comments and suggestions. **This is a project for the future. This is not by any means the final build.**  I'll probably wait until the better Richland APUs come out in a few months since they support FM2. I'm currently thinking of using Ubuntu with XBMC to fulfill both needs properly. Got some flak about why I'm using a cpu cooler on a NAS/HTPC. It's just for temp controls and something quieter than stock. Got some useful info on why I shouldn't go with that particular cpu and decided to stick with APUs. I got a relatively expensive case because it supports 8 drive bays and 2 200mm fans. I want 200mm fans since they are quieter than your typical 120/140mm.

I would down vote this. 

Why? Well

This is not a bias post nor a post comparing the 670 to the 7970. I'm just getting tired of the people suggesting overclocking a certain card then comparing it to a non-overlcocked alternative then claiming it will be ""faster"". 

Instead of leaning towards one gpu and claiming that if you overclock it, or the same overclock on both cards. 

I hope people will stop posting such shitty advice to others just because they're a fanboy of either AMD or Nvidia. Again

It's one thing if you mention that 'if' you overclock a card, please compare the same OC clocks or compare the reference clocks.

I'm not entirely sure that this is the right subreddit

As part of the renovation

I have


The machines I'd like to build:

Two (his and hers) gaming machines

We need all 6 of the 1440p monitors to come out of this budget.

We'd like a 60"" TV for the battlestation room too. (Open to the idea of a projector too)

One media server (connected to the thecus?) to put in the cupboard under the stairs.

We already have 3 mini ITX AMD APU builds running XBMCBUNTU. At present we just cart the media round on an external USB drive. We'd like to use the new CAT6 wiring

Our renovations came in under budget

We'll follow up with a picture tour of the new room once all is in place! It should look pretty cool

EDIT: Thank you for the amazing response! Some great discussion going on!

1328118517.0,p6dgr,A word on how much to spend.,nationalmaverick,478,98,264,"Hey guys
I am an avid enthusiast and build systems for a living
To clarify

I've been building my own and selling custom PC builds since I was 15 years old, I know I'm not the most experienced out of all the reddit demigods on here but I have some good advice I hope can help some people.

I would like to offer a little bit of experienced perspective on the amount of money the average redditor and gamer needs to spend to get the most out of their games.          
Many websites on the net will tell you the BEST of each category
 
This sort of review system leads people down the garden path of ""Ultimate Power!""
I am a huge nerd, writing, watching movies, browsing the net, everything, you won't meet many people that spend more time on their PCs then I do.       
 
I have been researching and studying hardware professionally for 10 years and I always stay totally informed on all components. 
          
**CPU**
As a rule
For instance, while for gaming a $220 i5 2500k is more then you could need.
One of the most important components
Right now the i5 2500K is the best CPU you can buy for your money hands down
Scaling up to an i7 will net you very little gaming performance improvement
[For more indepth but easily understandable reading](http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-cpu-review-overclock

**GPU**
The same goes for Graphics cards, like me, you like to have one monitor for gaming and maybe one other for browsing the net or watching TV while gaming, then one graphics card can more then meet your requirments and with technology far outpacing the average gaming design, you can buy a $230 nVidia GTX 560 Ti that, price vs performance will put most super high end cards to shame and will max Battlefield 3 and Skyrim on a 1080p monitor without batting an eye lid.      
[Further reading](http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review

Especially don't listen to minimum system requirements
This is an advertisement and support scheme that goes both ways for each company
This is evidenced by the fact that I myself have maxed Battlefield 3 on a test Gigabyte 6850 OC on a 1080 screen and gotten consistant 40+ FPS (more then playable) when I was told the system wouldnt be able to handle medium settings.       

**RAM** 
RAM is something you wont have to think to much about
My only major recommendation is DDR3 all the way

**Motherboard**
In some estimations, the motherboards for the Intel range of CPU seem to have the better feature sets for your average gamer, I personally look for at least USB 3.0 support, Sata 3 and optical audio out, along with the chipset and bios types, but that's a discussion for another thread, basically if you buy one of the well established brands (A very heated topic as all brand loyalty wars are) Gigabyte, Asrock, choose a good manufacturer for your chipset and remember that in PC building almost more then anywhere else

The other peripherals have been thoroughly covered in other articles and most of the time are pretty straight forward purchases, you usually use your PC for gaming.
I apologise in advance if a similar post has already been made

My last thought is that there is nothing more satisfying then building a powerful system and knowing you didnt blow huge amounts of money on it for little result

I myself am no expert when it comes to monitors or running a subreddit. The only reason I asked for ownership of /r/monitors is because the subreddit is basically dead

Feel free to share thoughts and opinions on the matter at hand. I personally feel /r/monitors could become a very useful tool in the future for the community. 

By the way

1363885710.0,1aqq3x,I am done purchasing from NCIX,tapwater86,489,111,224,"To edit: This is NCIX USA

3 times I've ordered from this company and all 3 have been slower and more difficult than with any other retailer.

First time the package was almost destroyed when it arrived. I chalked it up to damage during shipping

The second time they canceled my order without any explanation. Didn't even email me to say my order was canceled. I was sitting here wondering where my hard drive was and noticed a refund on my bank account. Called them up and they told me that they were out of stock and the drive had been discontinued. When I asked why their site said they were in stock at the time of my order

This time I ordered a case and CPU from them. It took them 3 times longer than any other place I ordered parts from to ship out my order

So a word to the wise. If NCIX says an item is in stock on their site

**Edit:** Since I'm about giving credit /u/Chris-NCIX replied to this post and is a Customer Care Manager with NCIX Canada. He asked that I email with any information I had. After doing so he messaged me back within a couple of hours and informed me he's investigating the issue. Since he's in Canada he can't personally investigate the issue but has calls scheduled for today to figure out my issue. I'm also assuming he plans to ask why their US branch has such horrible customer satisfaction.

Again this is only to the US branch. From the replied here the home branch in Canada has raving reviews. I don't think I've seen a single bad comment about the home branch. The US branch however appears that 75% of us have had some issue with them in the past.

He has said that any person who's had bad experiences with the US branch is encouraged to email him at ckinsman@ncix.com.

I'll update again when I hear back from him.


**Edit 2:**Chris just called me and covered a lot of details (And if he's reading this I welcome his corrections in the event I miss understood). He explained how the US branch recently went through a site upgrade around Christmas and how the stock tracking feature of the site has been bugged. There was a project to repair that bug but it was forgotten. He took 100% of the blame for the issue

tl:dr The US site is bugged and Chris will be working to resolve the inventory tracking feature and improve shipment estimates by Thursday. There was a lot of explaining of the situation and it's clear that Chris loves his job,,False,,t5_2rnve,1364002953.0,,True

Here's a nice list of parts for anyone who'd like to build their own AIO. It is just a bit more complicated to do than your standard desktop. Requires a few more specific bios settings

I took a risk on the Chassis (the Loop LP2150) because there was very little information out there on it. I'm happy to report that it went much better than expected. Not only is the panel nice, stable on it's stand, and it's got a real glass screen. I didn't order it from Amazon though, I got mine through [Provantage.](http://www.provantage.com/intel-cap08loopaio~7ITE911K.htm). It has an integrated webcam, mic, speakers, screen (duh) just like you're average off the shelf AIO.

**2) They perform about the same at stock clocks**

http://www.anandtech.com/bench/Product/523?vs=551

---

**3) The i7-3820 overclocks better than the i7-3770k**

[And don't tell me that the i7-3820 can't be overclocked](http://benchmarkreviews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=874&amp;Itemid=63&amp;limit=1&amp;limitstart=14) because it doesn't have a 'K'. The lack of a K just means that the processor has a capped multiplier.

The i7 3770K gets really hot when overclocked compared to the previous SB or SB-E chips due to the air gap introduced by ivybridge by Intel.

---

**4) Up to 40 PCIe lanes for dual GPUs**

This is a big one. In fact

z77 has a maximum of 16 PCIe lanes. This means if you get dual cards you are limited to x8/x8. Contrary to popular belief

[Bench for dual cards x8/x8 vs x16/x16 at high res](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/164qx0/psa_i73820_the_x79_chipset_and_gaming/c7sq49p)

---

**5) Quad Channel RAM**

Unlikely to give you any real world performance benefit

---

**6) Ivybridge-E is rumored to be on the 2011 socket for upgrades**

So don't tell me 2011 is a dead socket either. 1155 is more dead than it if you are going to make that accusation

---

Discussion is welcome

**TL;DR Recommend the i7-3820

---

**Other things to note from the discussions below:**

* For certain specific applications the i7-3770k outperforms the i7-3820. Be sure to check benchmarks if you have special requirements

* The i7-3820 uses more power than the i7-3770k. This shrinks into insignificance with power hungry GPUs but is worth considering

* The benefits of the increased bandwidth for dual card setups is reduced at lower resolutions",,t5_2rnve,1358784919.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/164qx0/psa_i73820_the_x79_chipset_and_gaming/

Two huge files

Pagefile.sys is basically a section of your harddrive that can be utilized if you run out of RAM and it is the size of your RAM as well. Wow

Hiberfil.sys is a section of your boot drive that allows your computer to hibernate. Basically, however if you disable the feature you can free that space entirely. I've never used hibernation mode before and frankly I don't feel its worth the 12GB of RAM it was using. [Here](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/15140/what-is-hiberfil.sys-and-how-do-i-delete-it/) is how to disable hibernation and free that space up.

1363960763.0,1asre7,Anyone seeking help in this sub please read this first.,Mitty002,454,99,47,"Hi guys

I've been on this sub for a few months and I spend most of my Reddit time on here helping you guys out with your computers. When you're looking for advice or help there's a few things you need to ensure you include in your post so that we can help you the best we can.

Before you make your post please read our FAQ's and sidebar. If you haven't got any parts picked out then head over to /r/buildapcforme before posting. If you do have a build you want to share then please use [PcPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com/) and use the Reddit markup section to copy/paste your build into your text post.

Here's a few points you should cover in your post:

• What is the purpose of your computer? Any informtion on how you use your computer and what you plan to do with it will help us pick parts specificity for your needs.

• What is your budget? Are tax and shipping included?

• What country do you live in? If the U.S

• When do you plan on building/buying the PC?

• Do you prefer to get all your parts from one place? Some people like to order all their parts from one place because it's easier.

• Are you able to get parts from a Microcenter? Microcenter have some pretty good deals so if it's possible to pick some parts up from one of their shops that's great.

• What exact parts do you need for that budget? CPU, monitor etc. The word ""Everything"" is not a valid answer. Please list out all the parts you'll need.

• Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes

• What is the max resolution of your monitor? What size is it?

• Do you plan on overclocking? If you do plan on overclocking then will it be a light boost or are you looking to get the most possible performance out of your chip?

• What future upgrades do you plan on making? Do you plan to add another GPU in for SLI or maybe add water cooling in eventually?

• If you have already chosen parts then why have you chosen them? Justify your decision so we don't have to guess.

• Do you have any personal preferences? It could be that you prefer intel over AMD or you like Corsair cases. Let us know. 

• What features do you need in a motherboard? RAID? Firewire? Crossfire or SLI support? USB 3.0? SATA 6Gb/s? eSATA? Onboard video (as a backup or main GPU)? UEFI? etc.

Mentioning all these things in your [Build Ready]

If you have any points to add to the list that I have missed then feel free to mention them in the comments and I'll add them in. 

Thanks guys and if you could upvote this post as its a self post so I gain no karma then it will make this whole process easier for everyone.

So over the past couple of months I have been working on my PC, and any work that involved me using his work bench. I think I have even convinced him to let me build him his next computer. But anyways, I hinted at him a month ago that I could really use a nice quiet 200mm fan for exhaust on the top of HAF 912, except I didn't specify what size of fan I just said ""fan"" so he got me a 140mm Xigmatek Crystal Fan. It's a great fan, but I have no where to put it on my case so I told him that I would have to return it.

Upon looking at his account to do a return through Newegg

My father is very persistent when it comes to customer service stuff like this so later he called Newegg and explained the situation to a Newegg rep over the phone.

With no fight, the Newegg rep told us that he would re credit the account for the price of the fan, but told us to not even bother sending the fan back. Maybe this happens at other stores too, but I have never seen such amazing customer service personally form an online site like I have seen from Newegg.

I'm happy to announce a few more features added to PCPartPicker that allow you to enter custom part prices

When adding parts to your part list

Clicking on the custom price button pulls up the following dialog: [(screenshot)](http://pcpartpicker.com/static/forever/images/blog/custom_part_price_dialog.png)

For each part

* Choose the cheapest available price
* Override to show price from a specific retailer
* Import purchase price from your inventory
* Enter your own purchase price manually

User inventory is a ""new"" feature that lets you track what parts you already own.  I've been using it internally for almost a year now

If you're not familiar with the inventory page though, and add them to your part list directly from the inventory page.  When adding from your inventory, it will automatically apply your purchase price for that part.

In addition to all of this

Also, or paid Y for this instead"", etc.

Rationale:

* CPU - No Microcenters near me, meh. Primarily for gaming so didn't need Hyper Threading on the i7.
* CPU Cooler - Wanted to go air, looks great with no loss of performance.
* Motherboard - I really liked the features (Built in wifi + bluetooth!), no big.
* Memory - 8 gigs of memory for gaming. Black. Low profile to fit under the engine block. Done.
* Storage: Had a 2TB media drive
* Video Card: Had good luck with XFX in the past, but were 4 eggs when I got them). Not sure if Newegg got a bad batch or cards are crappy. Guess I'll find out and see if XFX is still all about it's lifetime warranty. Myself - I've had no issues, love these things.
* Case - Fractal R4. I love minimal
* Power Supply - Went with a gold standard brand. Got some individually sleeved cables from ModDIY.com instead of doing it myself. because the stock ones are ugly as hell and because in the equation of my life time &gt; money. Wanted customs because with extensions you still have the mess coming out of the power supply
* OS: Windows 8 + Startisback. Glory.
* Monitor: Monoprice 30"" IPS. I originally got a 24"" 1080p 120hz monitor. I realized that 120hz meant nothing to me. Returned it
* Keyboard: Cooler Master Storm Quickfire Rapid, clean.
* Other: Bose speakers my dad no longer wanted, and HP Laserjet 1200 printer. The best fucking printer this world has or will ever see.

Hope you enjoyed my build.

Edit: I did get some extensions - I got a 3 to 1 fan extension (red) for the front fans and the HD audio from the front panel extension (Also red

Since joining BAPC

**Edit:** I wrote this post a year ago, if a little old. If you see something that needs to be changed, just let me know.

I am only an amateur nerd, please let me know.

P.S. Articles with specific tech recommendations will become more and more outdated as time wears on so be weary of trusting a 3 month old part recommendation.

###Basics

* **This process really isn’t as hard as it seems.** You need to spend a good amount of time researching and learning, but I promise you that if I can do it, you can do it.

* Should I build [my own computer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/dmp2j/is_it_cheaper_to_build_my_own_desktop/)

* **How much do I need to spend?** It depends on the purpose of your build. If you just want to play the current crop of games at max settings on a single monitor, you can make a really powerful machine for $600 that will play most games on really high settings. If you need a really powerful video editing station, you'll need to spend more, but seriously, $1,000 will get you a sick rig. Furthermore, future proofing is a [waste of money]( http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/diqq9/your_thoughts_on_future_proofing/
). 

* What each [computer part]( http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/dy5bs/looking_to_build_a_gaming_desktop_but_have_no/) does.

* [Acronym List.](http://www.overclock.net/t/6410/overclocking-acronyms-for-dummies)

* What [motherboard (mobo) specs](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/cw8ms/what_do_the_specifications_of_a_motherboard_mean/) mean. Another great post on [understanding mobos](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/m30sm/understanding_motherboards/).

* **Use the sidebar.** Tons of great resources in there.

I didn't want to remove the existing heatsink for fear of complete screwing up the card

[Picture](http://i.imgur.com/ApTgXqI.jpg)

I bent paperclips and hooked them under the screws. It actually hold it in place very well. That bubble will end up in the reservoir when I turn it on. 

[A different angle](http://i.imgur.com/jCz1k4C.jpg). As you can see

I originally had the waterblock more towards the back of the computer. When it was like that I cut holes in the bottom plate of the laptop and it fit on well and I was able to screw it on. After moving back the waterblock, with it off, it lays flat and it still suspended off the surface of the laptop cooler underneath. [Here's a picture](http://i.imgur.com/36RXuet.jpg) of the the back of the computer right side up.

From the waterblock

[Here's a closer view](http://i.imgur.com/RiXXQhE.jpg) of the pump

It's pretty [messy looking](http://i.imgur.com/gJJqrbs.jpg)

Also

It looks a bit impractical

*****
It's not perfect, I only overclock the VRAM to 1200 MHz while overclocking the core to 700, 800+ MHz. This results in totally managable core temps, but the VRAM can still hit high 80°s or even 90°. But it doesn't ever go past that. Core clocks affect the framerate much more anyway. 1200 vs 1800 MHz VRAM is only a 1-3 fps difference. However, going from 575 MHz to 800 MHz can give me a 33% or more increase in framerate.

Look at the overlay in the top left corner to see the temps and overclock settings. All screenshots were taken after temps stopped rising and playing the game for 5-10 minutes.

Therefore, to help us by ensuring all deal/sale related posts go to /r/BuildAPCSales (or /r/BaPCSalesCanada for Canadians).

Any deal/sale posts have been, and continue to be, **removed** from /r/BuildAPC. Users who crosspost deals between /r/BuildAPC and /r/BuildAPCSales will receive a **warning**, informing the user of our policy. Users who see sale/deal posts should **report** them, as this is the best way to bring a post to our attention. Persistent disregard for this policy may result in a **ban**. Bans are not undertaken lightly, but given the limited nature of our tools as moderators

We would also like to take this opportunity to ask that users refrain from posting pictures of their initial shipment of component boxes as individual posts. Pictures of this nature are welcomed as a part of the [Build Complete] tag, but we must try to optimize our space.

Over the past year and half I have been fortunate enough to become involved in this community in nearly every possible aspect.  After a quick redirect from /r/hardware, the mod team ended up selecting me and my role in the sub changed drastically.  The past year or so as a mod has been quite a blur - We started Tech Tuesdays, established an IRC channel, ran huge giveaways, partnered with manufacturers and implemented some really nice tweaks to the sub stylesheet.  It has certainly been a one of a kind experience.

With that in mind, none of this would have been possible and I truly will miss working behind the scenes for you all.

So with the big announcement out of the way I know that some users were requesting AMAs from the moderators...  To accommodate those requests, and I will be [streaming some games](http://www.twitch.tv/manirelli) this evening (starting about 930PM CST) if you wanna watch or yell at me in Teamspeak.

I have a windows 7 64 Bit Home Key available. I was going to sell it on eBay but figured someone else could use this key more than I can use the $25 or for whatever it would sell for.

anyway

so, but if you're living off of mommy and daddy, you dont count! 

aside from that, or PM me if you wish to be anonymous and at the end of the day, I'll choose one person at random. Your chances of winning the key are the same regardless of whether you PM me or post here.

also

finally, try to pay this forward for someone else :P

**Edit**

**Update 1** Okay..umm...I just got back home from the library to see how this thread was doing. 

1: Thank you for your kind words. I'm just doing part of my share of helping others out. No one ever gets to where they are alone, life, or even PC building.

2: I told you guys not to tell me why you needed it, I'm not laughing at your problem, but just the fact that you guys did more than what you had to)

3: I counted up the posts here and my messages asking for the key. There's a total of 43 (not including the people who were giving me their kind words). I will use a random number generator to pick a number. And whoever was that number to send me the message will get the key. For example

4: I understand that it may be against the TOS or it may not work to give a key tied to a hardware. I instead have a spare Win 7 Pro key that I bought from /r/hardware swap that hasn't seen use since I bought. I will instead give that key away. I'll work something out with whoever was second place.

5- Whoever the winner is

**Update 2** Winner has been selected and a spare Win 7 Pro key has been sent (not the Win 7 Home

I apologize if I wasn't able to reach you. Regardless, but the important thing is that when you come out of the hardship, you come out stronger and more knowledgeable than before. Don't count on anyone making everything easier for you, but do lend a hand to someone else if you're able.

I originally built this a couple years ago. However

I originally had a laptop HDD and some small fans I scrounged together

With the new upgrades I purchased some proper fans with motherboard headers. To be precise they're Fractal Design Silent Series R2 40MM (intake) and two 50MM (outtake). I also swapped the HDD for a 64 GB SSD which is still more than enough for this PC. I put in some actual motherboard mounting screws to hold it in place and now I'm not so concerned about it falling.

I use a remote with keypad and trackpad to operate it and it has Windows 7 on it.

For a screensaver I use the UberNES Nintendo Saver 2011. I like being able to jump into any game being displayed and play it.

If you plan on upgrading the PC in the future with a powerful graphics card

___
**Edit 1:**
Comment section now contains an interesting discussion. Please read if you have the time.
Here are my reasons for the choice of hardware
___
**Edit 2:**
If you can afford it
___
**Edit 3:**

**When I said Skyrim Maxed I meant the following:**

&gt;Full HD Resolution(1080P).

&gt;Ultra Preset.

&gt;2x Antialiasing.

&gt;FXAA Set to OFF

&gt;No vertical sync

&gt;Over 40FPS on average.

**And Diablo III Maxed at 4xAntialiasing is a non-issue as well**

___
**EDIT 4:**
Many alternate setups are being proposed. My reasons for these parts are still the following:

High durability

Long Lifespan

Upgradability

A Good Audio-Codec on the motherboard (Unlike all these Biostar boards suggested)

A Case with removable dust filters and two large (12CM) fans.
___
**EDIT 5:**
*Tip of the day*:

If you feel like you can do without a DVD Drive or the operating system - feel free to ignore those parts of the setup ;)
**BONUS EDIT: LIVE IN THE UK? IS AN HD6850 CHEAPER? GET THAT INSTEAD!**
___
**Final Edit:**

Now you may find a couple of better-value setups at this price point
I apologize for any mistakes I may have made or deals I may have overlooked in the making of this guide.

**I'm sorry** if I came off as pretentious because of this post. I was encouraged by two friends to post the build on reddit in this manner. I had no idea that it may have looked douchebaggy as has been mentioned.",,t5_2rnve,1339419660.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/uufnu/i_help_people_build_pcs_here_is_my/

Furthermore I've dedicated a lot of my time to a particular part of the computer. Most of my suggestions will involve this part and every suggestion will be quality. Infact for now on I am to preface each suggestion with not only why I am suggesting it but why it's important.

What part of the computer did Overclock.net get me so interested in? 

**The Power Supply.**

Simply put it's one of the most overlooked and important parts of the pc. Most new builders will completely forget and just get what is cheapest

So here are a few links

**[Tator Tot's epic Recomended PSU thread.](http://www.overclock.net/power-supplies/183810-faq-recommended-power-supplies.html)**
That guy is so good, not your average joe reviews actuall testing equipment that measures various things to objectively prove a psu's worth.

**[Phaedrus Quick'n'Dirty PSU calculator](http://www.overclock.net/power-supplies/1045231-phaedrus-quickndirty-psu-calculator.html)
**

This thread is also an epic post by another epic contributor to Overclock.net. Phaedrus is the voice of reason and gets the last word on everything over there. He taught me more then any one else when I mentioned to him that I was interested in helping out in that forum. This thread is a relatively new one

**[shinji2k PSU Review Database](http://www.overclock.net/power-supplies/738097-psu-review-database.html)** Once aqain Shinji2k is one of those guys you don't question. He literally is one of the most knowledgeable people on that forum, and makes sure you get good information. This thread does not only showcase the best, but also the worst. It's worth the read if you are not sure if a psu is good or not. Once again if a psu is not on this list then it is not worth buying, it's not worth the risk. It could be the best psu in the world but it would never have a good recommendation from myself or anyone else informed on the state of the psu market, for the simple fact that we haven't objectively proven it at this point.

Between these three links I feel you are given basically all the information you will need to not only suggest to new people but also make informed decisions for yourself. I do urge each an every one of you to either make an account there or at least to one of the many tech forums around the internet. That one being my all time favorite Once again though I'm not as in the loop as I used to be( hopefully as that will change seeing how I will be constructing a new pc soon) but I've not lost the experience that has made me into the person today. Part of that experience is knowing that by and large the most important part of the pc is that of the power supply for the simple fact that a good one will cost you more then you want to spend if you don't research into it

I'll be taking all questions but from here on out I will make sure not to just post a link and be on my way as I understand the newer people need a bit of explanation especially when it's about a power supply they don't even care about.

Just a couple notes on the cost. I was able to get the RAM for a lot less when it was in stock and also I purchased the PSU

Sleeving was done with MDPC.

Overall I'm very happy with the final build. Cable management was pretty difficult, so there still might be some performance to be had.

Temps for the CPU and graphics cards hover around 35C after several hours of Battlefield 3

EDIT: Thanks for all the replies. At the end of the day I'm still pretty torn, an expensive PC could be better in the long run, but if you don't utilize it a console could be cheaper.

*I don't know*

*Am I talking to myself or is that water bottle talking to me?*

*I'm not touching the water bottle so why are there ripples forming inside?*

*Why does Nestle make bottled water? Isn't that a chocolate company? Or is that Nestea? No

I own an independent game store, and this is not even close to the worst we've seen (for those wondering, the grime is so dark because the owner smoked around their system). I dont have a picture on hand of some of the computers we've done, but I have seen some horrible things (think spiders nests and computers coated in sand). Even though it isnt a PC, the same principles apply, so open your case up once in awhile and clean it! We use an air compressor over canned air to avoid spraying the chemicals from the can into the system, but canned air is better than nothing. Also

Letting dust and debris (not to mention if you smoke indoors) settle on your parts will raise operating temps, but keeping it clean will keep your rig brag worthy.

Again, but for newbies concerned with keeping their systems in top shape, these are some guidelines Id recommend following. Your budget build is going to cost a lot more than you think if you have to replace parts due to neglect. If you have other techniques to share, please do!

*EDIT: It has been pointed out to me that I should note one thing: Im NOT advocating opening consoles under warranty. The picture of the PS3 was intended to serve as a reminder that computer parts attract dust and debris, DONT OPEN IT unless you are willing to face the consequences. I make it clear to all my customers that this will void any warranty support, and I should have noted this here more clearly as well.

I tooled around with it and found it completely unresponsive.  It would boot up and take about 5 or so minutes to load to the desktop, so I connected it to my desktop to see if I could access his files and back them up that way.  It worked, and I did a fresh install of Windows after getting his HDD back in the laptop.  This seems to have done the trick, and I have drilled it into my dad's head to back up his data, which, of course, he never thought to do.

I made a [Build Complete] post a month or two ago, a disk drive, did some cable management and removed the HDD cage.

It plays Diablo 3 (beta) on max with ~50FPS, GTA medium at 50FPS. Resolution is always at 1920x1080. I haven't gotten the chance to play other games.

1366500955.0,1crqcl,The True Cost of Building with a Cheap Power Supply.,nwash57,357,56,202,"This is a ""Public Service Announcement"" style post

I built my computer Christmas of 2011, so all my research was done on my own. I didn't have a clue what manufacturers were considered decent and I just looked for the specifications I needed at the lowest price, while maintaining relatively good reviews. I used [THIS](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817517001) power supply for $40 when I built. 

This past week I was playing some games on my computer as usual and suddenly my computer just shut off.. I tried to turn it back on and the fans twitched and my power supply whined so I shut it off and pulled the PSU out. I put it on my table and plugged it in and jumped it and the PSU fan once again just twitched and the component whined. I figured ""Well that kinda sucks, only a little over a year of use. So I went to Micro Center and picked up one of [THESE](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139051&amp;Tpk=corsair%20cx750m&amp;IsVirtualParent=1) for $80 and brought it home. I unboxed it and stuck it in my case, making sure everything was plugged in. Turned on my computer and the fans spun up, fantastic! I shoved all the extra SATA cables and stuff behind the side panel on my case and then plugged my peripherals in. Turned my computer on again and hopped into my computer chair excited to have a working computer again... but something was odd, neither of my monitors picked up a signal. Thought maybe I forgot to plug something in, so I rechecked it all. Nothing was unplugged, so I took my graphics card out and reinserted it into the PCI-e slot. Still no video. So I plugged into my onboard video and that finally gave me a signal, got all the essentials in and still no video, but I'm skeptical that ASRock is going to let it go through because I added an aftermarket fan that replaced the stock fan mount
 
 

If my RMA fails and I have to buy another board

So in total my cheapy power supply has now cost me a minimum of:

$40 - for the original PSU

$80 - for the replacement PSU

$120 total.
 
 

If my RMA fails

$40 - for the original PSU

$80 - for the replacement PSU

$80 - for the board it fried

$110 - for replacing the board it fried

$310 total

But hey

Modern frontier chefs are using a lot of science to find new ways to prepare and present food, but also century old cooking techniques are very precise chemical reactions. But just following a guide will get you only so far. Like with overclocking you have to tweak and test it

So what I see a lot in gamer's dens and general bachelor households is canned ravioli with tomato sauce. [This stuff here.]( http://i.imgur.com/wvromdQ.jpg) Canned ravioli lands on a rather unflattering very

I will show you the basic recipe for a pasta dough for the ravioli with ricotta and mozzarella cheese filling together with a very basic tomato sauce. 

**For the pasta** - ~ a batch of 20-25 ravioli

**~250g** general purpose flour

**~50g** durum wheat semolina
**3** eggs

**2** tablespoons olive oil

**3** pinches of salt

A little bit of addition flour on the side


**For the filling I use**

**~1** box of ricotta cheese (around 300-400g?)

**2 globes** mozzarella cheese

**1** small lemon

**1-3** tablespoons olive oil


**For the tomato sauce**

**1** can of whole tomatoes

**1** small onion

**1** slice of garlic

**a bit* of olive oil for the pan/pot



General spices: salt, thyme, parsley and rosemary. Extra bonus for parmigiano reggiano.


**Part 1 - Pasta**
I know, but change or even improve it on your own. 

So I use a mix of general purpose flour and durum wheat flour for my dough. The durum wheat adds a certain bite to your pasta

In the same way I've found 3 eggs to work for me to get the right texture for the dough. Mix all the pasta ingredients into a bowl.  Don't be too easy on the salt. Just a little pinch won't do, like all over your hands sticky, add more flour! If it is too dry and crumbles add another egg! You should get one nice clump of dough in the end in your bowl, easy to form and just a bit sticky. Let it rest in the fridge for around 30 minutes.

**Part 2 - Filling**

In the meantime to the filling. I have chosen a ricotta-mozzarella mix, salmon, or even greeny things like spinach love to get wrapped in pasta. 

Just mix the ricotta and mozzarella into a bowl. Rub off a bit of the lemon zest to add a slight, like citrus fruits (think like duck and oranges, or steak and cranberries). Be careful with the zest, you can easily overpower your cheese, same with the olive oil. Add both of them in small parts to bowl and add more if needed. If you do not have any special tools to get the zest try a very sharp, short blade. Carefully peel the yellow part of the skin and then cut it down in tiny parts. If you just can't get the zest use the lemon juice, but be careful - don't forget, rosemary

That's it! Unto

**Part 3 - Tomato Sauce**

Why canned tomatoes and not fresh ones? Hey I am lazy as everybody else ;) But even more important most fresh supermarket tomatoes here in Europe, California) or home-grown tomatoes (quite the work to grow them for the yield you can produce at home, but you cannot believe the flavour explosion) do it of course! If you have fresh ones cut an X into the skin in the bottom and put them for 30-60s into boiling water. They will easily peel. Remove the cores, it's mostly water and seeds and you don't want that in a good sauce. All you need is the delicious flesh.

Put your pan or pot on heat. Add the olive oil when heated and let it rest a bit. Don't put anything in the cold oil at first, but especially with canned tomatoes it should be quite fluid. Let it simmer for a bit to reduce your stock into a nice thick sauce. Season with salt, pepper, oregano and sugar. Tomatoes need sweetness as a counterbalance. If you feel that your sauce misses a certain *baaam* add a little bit of acid - lemon juice or white vinegar. But be careful, especially vinegar can quickly overpower your flavours. 

Generally most meals need a certain kind of balance between salt

Set the sauce aside or let it simmer a bit more to reduce it. The goal is a s nicely thick sauce. Look at the end for a photo!

**Part 4 - Assembly

We are nearly done now. Your pasta should be ready by now, just dust if off with flour to make it non-stick. Also dust your working space, so the dough won't get glued to it. With a pasta machine just form a flat bit of dough and use your widest settings at first. Reduce thickness by one bit each time you go through. Use one hand on the crank and the other one below the machine to pull the pasta a bit. 

With the rolling pin (or even a big drinking glass, but for the ricotta-mozzarella ravioli in a thick tomato sauce a thicker pasta with more bite to it works very well.

Spread the pasta on an area where you can easily put the filling on and then easily overlap it. [Look here for an example.](http://i.imgur.com/E4JHUMX.jpg) You also see that I used a cooking brush with normal tap water to paint the dough. This will help get the dough sticky again

[Use a knife or pizza roller to cut out the raviolis.](http://i.imgur.com/QND6PY2.jpg) Waste dough goes into the bowl again with the rest of the pasta, but I still would use the extra work with the fork - you won't want the raviolis to open while cooking.

Set a pot with salt water to boil (don't be shy with the salt) and reheat your sauce. Endgame time. Fresh pasta is done very quickly. If you see the ravioli swimming on the surface add maybe a minute to the time and then you can remove them from the water. Use one ravioli as a test - the exact cooking time depends a lot on the thickness of the pasta.

Your sauce can always wait, but give it a second to drain the excess cooking water. If your sauce is too thick add a bit of the salty pasta water. Generally don't add oil to your pasta - freshly drained it won't stick, so quickly plate it or even better let it rest in the sauce!

[Once plated with the sauce give a bit of parsley and parmigiano reggiano on top.](http://i.imgur.com/rs1Ja0K.jpg) We were quite hungry

We had some leftover pasta, onion filling from earlier. Add that to a nice beef-veggie stock and you have [a wonderful wintertime soup.]( http://i.imgur.com/WcM6Zw8.jpg)

Don’t be shy with your feedback. While I liked my results very much, they tend to grow a bit while cooking. Smaller portions are also easier on the eyes I think.

Bonus chapter for the people who have read so far: Asian Flavours

You can easily add Asian flavours to your meals with a couple of sauces, oyster sauce, hoisin sauce, siracha sauce. 

Fish sauce, really tastes good and once cooked with other ingredients you won’t smell it anymore.  More people are familiar with soy sauce. It is a more subdued saltiness with a bit of sweetness into it. Both sauces complement each other nicely in the saltiness department! Use them as your main flavours in a stir fry for example.
Hoisin and oyster sauces are more thicker and sweeter
And I think many of you know Siracha sauce. Adds hot and spicy to your food

How do you use them? Often and freely ;) For a stir fry get your stuff cooking on high heat, season with pepper and a bit of sugar, add hot and spicy with Siracha.

For a quick fried rice: Cook onions and garlic, use max heat and let it fry. Fish, soy, hoisin, siracha, pepper – done. If you want veggies and meat to the fried rice, cook them beforehand until roughly ~80 percent done and set aside.  Fry your rice

1348948914.0,10ohn5,How to POST the Essentials,fp4,352,48,66,"**How to POST the Essentials**

So you're putting together your build and you get everything all screwed down, that however is unlikely and I'll walk you through a way you can test and confirm your essentials work by POSTing them outside of the case.

**What are the Essentials?**

* CPU
* Motherboard
* RAM
* Power Supply
* Video Card (If onboard video isn't present)

This tutorial assumes you've installed the CPU and CPU Fan

Newegg covers the following in their [External Build](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_56kyib-Ls&amp;feature=youtu.be) portion of their build video.

**1\. Isolate the Motherboard**

I begin by setting my motherboard up on a flat (non-conductive) surface

Note: If you've already mounted it to the case

http://i.imgur.com/PD8fh.jpg

**Hey! Isn't potentially dangerous to boot outside the case?**

It can be for instance if you place your motherboard on a conductive surface like a metal or wet counter

**2\. Connect Power Supply Cables**

There are two main power supply cables that you need to connect to the motherboard:

* 20/24 Pin Motherboard Power
* 4/8 Pin CPU Power

http://i.imgur.com/K1fgq.jpg

**3\. Install 1 Stick of RAM**

To prevent any RAM related issues just remove them all and only use one stick of RAM. The RAM will click down into place when installed properly.

http://i.imgur.com/RPXGK.jpg

**4\. No Onboard Video? Install Video Card**

As you can see here I have no onboard on my motherboard so I have to install a video card. Make sure you plug in the PCI-E (6/8 Pin) power connectors to the video card if required.

http://i.imgur.com/mZjlC.jpg

**5\. Connect Monitor Cable**

If you're using a video card make sure you plug your monitor cable into the video card instead of your motherboard's video output. If your video card doesn't have the output you need (I.e. [VGA](http://i.imgur.com/W9ccL.jpg)) check the video card box for an adapter.

http://i.imgur.com/FfhM4.jpg

**6\. Flip Power Supply Switch On**

Make sure your power supply's little toggle switch on the back is flipped on. Motherboard's with indicator lights will turn on when the power supply is connected and on. The switch should look like [this](http://i.imgur.com/PovPq.jpg) when it's on.

**7\. Short the Power Switch Pins**

Note: If your motherboard has an on-board power switch you can simply use it instead of shorting the pins.

You can either brute force it and tap your screwdriver between any of the two pins or check your motherboard manual. Alternatively if you're not comfortable shorting it with a screwdriver you can bring your case close enough and connect the PWR switch to the motherboard and just press the power button instead.

http://i.imgur.com/lIjEd.jpg

**8a. Success!?** 

Upon shorting the power switch pins you should notice that the fan(s) have turned on and you can see a BIOS/POST screen on your monitor. You are now ready to start putting your build back to together one piece at a time.

http://i.imgur.com/n9MdO.jpg

If you aren't seeing the BIOS screen on your monitor verify that you plugged the monitor cable into the right spot (refer to Step 5) and that it is firmly plugged all the way in. Also make sure your monitor is set on the right input source as sometimes they can be set to display DVI when you only have a VGA plugged in and vice versa.

**8b. Nothing happened.**

Here's a small collection of troubleshooting tips:

* Double-check your essential power connections.
* Try re-seating your stick of RAM in a different slot.
* Verify that you are getting power from the power outlet.
* Make sure your power supply's switch is flipped to the on position.
* [Verify that your power supply works](http://www.corsair.com/en/blog/testing-your-corsair-power-supply). If it doesn't then [RMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/10ohn5/how_to_post_the_essentials/c6fefrn) it.

If you're able to verify that your power supply does work then I would [RMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/10ohn5/how_to_post_the_essentials/c6fefrn) the motherboard,False,,t5_2rnve,1368917122.0,,,t3_10ohn5

Through overclock.net I learned about others building 4 processor AMD Opteron systems that are overclockable and I decided to go that route after crunching the numbers vs. going with dual Xeon E5 system. 

I posted this on /r/battlestations a while back and people over there said I should post the full details here. Pictures of the rig are here http://imgur.com/a/2FPoW I just realized the GPU in the pictures is before I put the GTX 670 in.

Wanted my Brother to play Diablo 3 with me

I was surprised by how awesome the motherboard was considering it cost $15-it's pretty basic

I've already tried out D3 on the machine and it plays pretty well.  I may fiddle with it some more before I give it to him next week

EDIT: Glad everyone liked the build!  I think there were a lot of questions posted that I didn't get to answer.  The most popular questions seemed to be ""How will this system handle ""'XYZ?'""  I haven't played all current games on the build so I'm not sure.  I think this build will handle most current games at least on lower settings.  Usually you can find info on the game sites about minimum/recommended specs.  

I also have been getting questions like ""What sorts of upgrades would you recommend?""  That's kind of a can of worms sort of question; I'd want to upgrade the CPU-then the MOBO-then the GPU-then throw in an SSD

The best advice I can give everyone looking to make their own PC is start with a budget, google should be your first resource and then if you can't find the answer, post a Build Help thread here.

* Mobo: Wanted something with USB 3.0.

My goal was to spend less than $350 on hardware

All in all I'm really pleased with the build. I was hoping for low power, along with having a the CD drive and HDD active. I also wanted low noise and while you can hear the one fan if there is no other source of noise in the room it's barely louder than a whisper and as soon as the TV is on you can't hear it at all. 

My only major disappointment is the look of the front of the case. It just seems too plain to me

I am really pleased with the mechanics of the case. I thought the top might be too loose with it just hanging off the 4 little slider feet,,False,,t5_2rnve,False,,True

1350309132.0,11ie2v,A quick guide to taking better pictures of your new PC.,PenName,350,69,56,"I'm reposting this with the hopes that a few more about-to-build people will read it.


So all your parts have arrived and you've already got your PCPartPicker [Build Complete] post formatted? Now all that's left is to assemble it
I know it's tempting to want to get your work out there to show all of us on Reddit that sweet new rig of yours as soon as possible
So


1.  Make sure you've got good lighting in the room. Turn the lights on, so maybe you're like me and the PC lives in the basement without good lighting. So, what do you do?

2.  Make sure you're using a flash when appropriate. Digital Cameras / DSLRs will generally have a built in flash that triggers automatically. If the flash is going off, the flash can do some funky stuff. You'll want to diffuse the flash (if you're reading this guide, I'm assuming you're not an avid photographer with an OCF). This means you'll want to put something translucent in front of the flash, like toilet/tissue paper, or even notebook paper. The goal is to turn that blinding ball of white into a soft, even glow. This will keep your pictures from having parts that are blown out (all white with no detail) while at the same time places that are too dark.

3.  Decide what you're trying to show in each picture you take. Don't just point the camera at the mobo and say ""look how cool this is!"" Are you trying to show off a unique heatsink? The perfect color coordination between your RAM and your mobo? Some shrink-wrapped cable management? Decide what you want the viewer to look at and ensure that is the focal point of your shot (I'm not going into rule of thirds here

4.  Speaking of FOCUS

* There might not be enough light. With too little light, meaning even if you think you're holding it perfectly still, those tiny movements will show up. To solve this issue, add more light. If you can't add more light, try a tripod (or setting the camera down on a flat surface and using a remote/timer mode to trigger the shot).

* The actual focal point (what the camera is deciding to focus on) is on something other than what you want. Like your cat in the background. I don't want to go into depth of field here, it will be blurry since it isn't in that defined range. To fix this, you need to either adjust in camera what you're focusing on (many cameras these days have a little rectangle that pops onto the LCD showing what the focus point is), or move closer/further away to ensure your target is in the right range.

5  Do a bit of work before uploading to the web. Maybe to get the shot in focus, we're gonna look at it. And if it's not what you want us to be looking at, it detracts from the shot. Don't worry if you don't have heavy duty photoshop tools, that's ok. If you've got them, and know how to use them though, I'd definitely recommend cleaning up the colors and contrast a bit. The hard part about PCs is that you've got things that are both very bright and very dark all in the same space, which modern cameras have a hard time dealing with. If you're noticing this problem with your pictures, contrast

6  Tell a story with your album upload. Now, I just want to see a few snazzy pics and move on to the next one. Either way is fine for you, just know that the more pictures you post, the smaller your audience will be (like a YouTube video. You're far more likely to watch :30 vs 30:00.) I also prefer the least amount of clicks, so a scrolling option on the album is what I use, but think about what you want the experience for your viewers to be like.

7  Title / Caption the pictures. Call out anything you want us to look at

To be honest I found this whole process pretty overwhelming when I first came here - but it really doesn't need to be. While I patiently wait for my ncix/newegg shipments to arrive in the mail over the next few days I thought I'd put together some info for people

* **Read the links in the sidebar.** Seriously. I found all the info a bit overwhelming at first too but even if you don't absorb everything on the first read thru the [BaPC Beginner's Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/f3efg) and the [Logical Increments Buying Guide](http://s1002.photobucket.com/albums/af150/The_FalconO6/CurrentLogicalPCBuyingGuide/?action=view&amp;current=Guide.png) are your friends. You'll refer back to them often as you go.

* **PCpartpicker will only list parts compatible with what you've already added to your system.** I believe there are some small exceptions here (like cases that are too small for the graphics card) but once you have your build ready the friendly folks at BaPC are usually quite happy to help point stuff like this out. And you can always do a final sanity check before you start buying. But for the most part you can stop stressing the compatibilty issue by using pcpartpicker.

* **Decide on an AMD CPU or an Intel CPU before you start worrying about your other components.** In truth, with various sales, price drops, etc, this may or may not be the case when you're ready to start buying for your build.

* **Decide on your overall budget early.** Once that's done you can determine how much of said budget you're going to need to allocate to each component. Don't depend on possible upcoming sales or deals...the best time to buy something will always be a few months after you bought it. Seriously

* **Most people recommend using a standard ATX mobo for your first build.** Sure

* **Someone has likely already done your build here in BaPC.** Read through old threads and the comments in them. Not every commenter is an expert so don't rely solely on the opinions of one or two people. At the same time

* **A thought on PSU's:** modular PSU's are recommended but not an absolute requirement. To put it simply; non modular psu's have permanent cables

* **Don't pick a case just because it looks cool** or because you have an old one sitting around somewhere. Cases are important and should last you through many builds if you do your homework. 

* **Read the links in the sidebar. Again.** That info was a lot to take in at first

* **Have fun!** Seriously,** man.

If I've misstated anything, because **they are awesome** like that.

With the blessing of the mods, here's a little background.

Folding@Home was created by scientists at Stanford University as a way to develop cures for diseases such as Alzheimer's, and many types of cancer. Basically, what it does is utilize donated computer power to study how proteins are manipulated or ""folded,"" which gives insight into how these devastating disease work. With this knowledge, scientists are able to research more effective cures.

Folding sends your computer a set of calculations to compute. Once your system finishes the calculations, it will send your computer a more complex calculation than if it detects that you have a weaker system. Therefore, more powerful computers are better.

Everyday I see people post completed builds with significant amounts of computing power available. If this power could be harnessed and put towards folding

Hello /r/buildapc!

First off, for my choice of using the z77 chipset, please note that I didn't intend on buying two separate cards from the get-go! When I began assembling this build, my goal was to overclock a core i7 3770k (as I had read about it's somewhat reasonable overclock-ability, and wanted to have thunderbolt connectivity) with a beefy overclock, watercooled, and a SINGLE GTX Titan (which was set to release right around the time this build would have been completed).

In the mix of things, doesn't seem like there's much else I can do except for keeping on!

Then I was posed with the question of whether I should buy a single GTX titan or SLI two 680's

Anyways here are PICTURES: http://imgur.com/a/xmzmn
(These are pictures of my initial build with the GTX 580's, but seemed a bit too laggy in multiple monitor gaming)

AND MOAR PICTURES: http://imgur.com/a/EKJ6r
(These are pictures of the completed build

Anyways

So being the overly impatient goof that I am, namely slots 1 and 2B.

I didn't realize the second card was going into 2B

WTF?!?!? Who the hell would guess that?!? If anyone owns this motherboard and knows what I'm talking about will know that it's suggested this way, so I went and took a looksy in the BIOS and this is what I found (a whole lotta wut): http://imgur.com/y3G0jza

Anyways, but I'll upload results if it'll help anyone help me determine whether this is bad, or if virtual lanes will make do and won't cause too much of a hassle!

I absolutely love this machine! I use it primarily for gaming and streaming. I know I'll probably get some flak for using a closed loop cooling system with a single width rad

There's no optical drive in the build because I have an external DVD drive so I just used that

My hands don't work very well at all so building this had it's difficulties for me

This,"" but I was able to get it to work with the 4th gen processor by disabling the Intel C-State feature in the motherboard bios (MSI Z87-G45). This basically makes the processor run like a 3rd gen would as far as power consumption goes. This is not a problem because CPU power consumption is not as much of an issue on desktops, as opposed to laptops and ultrabooks. 

I have been running the system for a month and it has been completely stable

I hope that this helps clear up any confusion around Haswell power supply comparability

1360302348.0,184862,[Build Complete] My retro liquid cooled HTPC build,86ipods,299,29,44,"Alright guys I’m going to submit this the proper way this time.


This is my old school looking HTPC build that I just completed. The ultimate goal was to have the computer blend in with its surroundings. It’s not a high-end or expensive PC by any means but it’s plenty for what I use it for. I am running Windows Server 2008 R2 and I run two media servers on it: PlayOn and Twonky Server. I use Twonky for streaming local media and PlayOn for Hulu and other random channels. I used liquid cooling because I wanted to maintain the completely stock look of the case but still have quiet and consistent cooling. I harvested a lot of the parts from a previous HTPC build but originally I spent in between $200-$300. Parts list:


CPU:  AMD Athlon X2 255 3.10 GHz

Liquid Cooling:  Zalman LQ-310 Water Cooler

Motherboard:  MSI 880GM-E43

RAM:  4GB G.SKILL Ripjaws DDR3 1600

PSU:  Thermaltake TR2 W0070 430W ATX 12V

Case:  JVC Cassette Stereo


I really had a lot of fun with this build so feel free to ask any questions and thanks for looking!

I realize there is already a PSU guide on the right side

What makes a power supply different aside from wattage and specs?  THE QUALITY OF THE COMPONENTS.  Inside a power supply are a lot of capacitors and solder connections.  Cheap power supplies use cheap capacitors and tend to use a low quality solder.  This ultimately means your power supply will die prematurely

*  More wattage does not mean its a better power supply.  Do not cheap out on your power supply.  You will get better performance

* A 500 Watt power supply sometimes means it peaks at 500 watts

* A good power supply will have an *Efficiency rating* at or above 85%


* [Calculate out your needs](http://www.extreme.outervision.com/psucalculatorlite.jsp) in terms of wattage.  If you plan to add components later

*  **Total Amperage Available on the +12V Rail(s) is the most important
  
*  A post from Simmo1404 suggests that it is important to remember that cheaper power supplies may often have cheaper fans, may vibrate, or be less efficient at moving air.  Not all fans are created equal and cheaper ones may fail more easily and burn up the PSU with it.

* It has been notably mentioned that some ""no-name"" brand power supplies are in fact manufactured by high-end companies.  But

**I cannot possibly emphasize enough the importance of a good power supply in your system.**  A good quality power supply will last you 7-8 years before the parts start to break down.  Most likely you will outgrow the power supply before it ever fails.  *Most importantly though

**Here are a few more reads.**

I've been thinking about if there is a business model for this community. I figure the builders here represent a wide geographic area and all of you like to build. Some of your are experienced. Some of you are novices. Lots of people out there in the world want new computers that provide a nice bang for their buck.

What about a centralized resource where people could put in the specs they want (e.g. GAMING/HTPC/BEAST/GENERAL USE/ETC.)

BuildAPC people could register on the site to be notified about requests in their geographic or knowledge area and claim the 'tickets' to do the build.

They would then take the req, build and deliver it.

Buyers could rate builders on speed, etc.

Builders could tack on whatever margin they want. Say it's a $500 build

I've got a couple ideas. FYI you guys will appreciate that the the domain camper on buildapc.com wants $29

I thought it might be a nice way to allow builders to build when they want and make a little extra money. People could dip in and out or

Just an idea. Wanted to see what you guys thought.

**edit 2**: Thank you one and all for this constructive, feedback. As someone who was in their 2nd year of university before the 'web' even existed, I am still, 20 years later, impressed by how well it works for the exchange of ideas. It's not all kittens and porn. This is what it was for!

Started building in June of last year, and a GTX 670... but I wasn't happy with that. Browsing /r/gamingpc is bad for my bank account, clearly. 10 months later, here I am with this monstrosity, and this time I'm quite happy with it. There are a few more changes in the cards for this build, including custom made backplates from dwood http://www.triptcc.com for the 7970s, cable sewing the PCI and 24-pin power cables, but this is close enough to completed that I'm willing to post it. 

After shipping, so on and so forth). But here is the PCPartpicker list. The prices are all edited to reflect what I actually paid for each item.

Since it's going to be primarily for graphic design and photography work, gaming performance isn't a huge deal to me. Sure, I'll play a game of Starcraft or two occasionally, but it's not a gaming rig. The current drive setup I have in the system is the Samsung 840 for boot and the WD Blue 1tb for my 'working' data. The two Greens are in a RAID 1 Mirror, so that's where I store my Time Machine backups and all my *ahem* acquired movies and tv shows.

A major constraint I had on building the system was OSX compatibility. I know most of you are Windows users, Mass Effect) and maybe some 3D Rendering.

After the whole process

**Good**

 - A really fun project. I really took my time with it
 - So far
 - The watercooling loop was a lot easier to assemble and bleed than I was anticipating.
 - Very quiet. That's one thing I was unhappy with about my MacBook Pro
 - Should be pretty future-proofed for the kind of stuff I need. Hopefully I won't need to make any serious modifications for the next couple years.


**Not so Good**

 - Getting all the drives in place was a MASSIVE pain in the ass and, imagine trying to thread a needle, when you can't see the needle or the thread, and you're trying to do the whole thing in a box full of knives. Not fun.

 - Due to Apple's stupid design on the front panel, it's kind of annoying.
 - Due to the case design, as many cases do. That would make the whole process about a million times easier.

**ToDo's**

 - I'd like to try making a jumper cable to solve the FireWire Ground issue. That way

 - The GPU power still needs to be sleeved. Not terribly difficult

Other than those things, which will be far more fun than studying for finals (as I should be doing.) Thanks for reading all the way through... I know it was long :)

1322945717.0,mz0zv,An alternative to standard build sheets and the logical increments guide,pcpartpicker,321,61,88,"The Logical Increments Guide is an excellent resource.  The [recently proposed standard build sheets](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/myg5g/can_we_make_standard_favorite_reddit_computer/) is a great idea.  However

**PCPartPicker will buy, and will be made available on the site in an easily sortable and searchable manner.**  As the inventory of parts increases month to month, I will mix and match components among builds to further flesh out the benchmark data and fill in obvious gaps in coverage.

The main limitation of standard build sheets and the Logical Increments guide is that a limited set of builds cannot easily take many application-specific needs into account.  Having a diverse set of benchmarks run on many part combinations with up-to-date pricing data solves this problem.

Want to know what build gives you the best price vs. performance for game X or application Y?  No problem - I'll show you what various combinations of components scored on each, etc.  Let's say you will also be able to graph price vs. performance of a host of builds for the benchmark of your choice.

As pricing data changes daily, benchmark it, and add the results to the database.  If you're looking to upgrade, this can give you real-world data that will help you decide whether it is worth upgrading a particular component.  

Where I need help from you is choosing what parts and combinations to benchmark.  I will take the proposed builds and feedback from this subreddit and use that to drive what parts are bought

If this idea gains traction

1368415359.0,1e8226,"[Discussion] AMD's ""Module"" Architecture: The FX 8350 is not a Quad-Core.",nahvkolaj,313,52,260,"**A Guide to AMD’s “Module” Microarchitecture**
-

Okay. There’s confusion on BaPC about AMD’s CPU microarchitecture

*Disclaimer: I am not a computer microarchitecture engineer. I do not claim to understand the low-level intricacies of CPU design. I do, so there’s that.*

**Bulldozer**

Bulldozer is AMD’s recent, are based on the foundation laid by Bulldozer. Since they are based on the first-generation Bulldozer, much of what I say here can be applied to the current Piledriver-based Vishera FX CPUs.

Bulldozer differs from a “traditional” core microarchitecture in that it pairs cores together in “modules” to share several key features of a traditional core. [Here is a basic high level look at the BD architecture.](http://i.imgur.com/NgBdlEE.jpg)

This is what AMD calls a module. A module is recognized as two logical cores by the operating system. In a patch released for Windows 7 and by default in Windows 8

**What’s Not Shared**

The module contains two “traditional” integer cores, AMD anticipated CPUs being tasked primarily with integer calculations and GPGPU cores tasked primarily with highly paralleled floating point arithmetic. I put “traditional” in quotes because it can be argued that there is no such thing as a “traditional” core. CPU cores are constantly evolving and at some level still share resources.

**The FPU**

The reason some people like to call the 8350 a ""pseudo 8 core"" processor lies mostly with its floating point unit(s). A Bulldozer module has *two* 128-bit FPUs that can be paired to carry out 256-bit AVX instructions (the second key to it being an 8-core CPU). Each modern Intel CPU core has its own 256-bit wide FPU. AMD made a bet that floating point calculations would not be essential to strong CPU performance in the long run

**Other Shared Bits**

The module’s cores, fetch, decode, and L2 cache. Once again, a big reason for this was to minimize cost while the engineers anticipated minimal performance loss from this design. Fetch and decode have been at the center of some debate on Bulldozer’s performance and even the subject of AMD roadmaps, where they advertise “feed the cores faster” on slides detailing future microarchitecture updates, likely giving each core its own set of fetch, and L1 instruction cache.

**It’s Not Hyperthreading (Neither is HyperTransport)**

This is a big one. Modules are *not* like Hyperthreading. These modules are *not* dual-threaded cores

*Also, Athlon, and FX CPU platforms, is not akin to Hyperthreading. HyperTransport is a bus used by the CPU to communicate with the Northbridge. Nothing more.*

**Windows 8 and the W7 Patch**

After the release of the Zambezi FX processors, but this is why programs like Cinebench show the 8350 as a 4C/8T CPU.

I got the mobo damaged for free off craigslist. It just needed some new solder so I had someone at work do magic.

The GPU is a MSI GTX 560-TI 446 Cuda. This also came for free off craigslist for giving somebody a ride to the beach with me! I gotta say

No cool story for the CPU.... Its just a Phenom II 945 that I had in the basement. Still looking for a 8350 :D

I decided on AMD for numerous reasons. While I like Intel

1. Price/performance
2. The 8320 came with 3 games
3. More cores
4. Socket AM3+.

Now, I can always buy a cooler later on.


 How did I get 3 games? At Canada Computers, including Hitman Absolution, Sleeping Dogs and Far Cry 3. Moral of the story, always argue!

So

**CPU**: Price per performance

**Cooler**: Used stock here to save a little bit of cash. Still, but still a little loud for me, even with the R4. Makes a very discrete hum when on full blast, but nothing like the people of BaPC explain it. Overall, I'm happy with it, but want to upgrade soon.

**Mobo**: This motherboard is *fantastic*. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an AM3+ build

**RAM**: Corsair Vengeance

**GPU**: Now, but it was always out of stock! I noticed out of the corner of my eye, in store, the [little ""XT""] (http://memextreme.com/wp-content/gallery/meme-faces-l/surprised-rainbow-face-l.png). Snagged it for 250$. Runs silent, cool and looks good. Good buy.

**Wireless Adapter**: I unfortunately couldn't route an Ethernet cable, only spent 5$ on it so whatever, it's fast enough and has little ears.

**Case**: Need I even explain? Just look at it! Now, cool and minimal. Plus, the window is a nice little feature and lets me peek at my parts. The fan controller works wonders, makes a difference of ~5* from minimum to maximum and runs quietly, although the difference between 7V and 5V is very slim. Everything is *solid*, like the Mercedes of cases. I was expecting its weakest part to be the door, but not one bit, the door seems to be the best-constructed part of the case. The case only comes with two fans

**HDD**: Had a 500gb 7200rpm lying around

**PSU**: (Note that the said PSU isn't on PPP, when I saw this PSU on *sale* for 110$, I couldn't resist. Only two cables are non-modular, and those are the 24pin and the CPU power, both of which are required so no biggie. The cables are all very nice and long, so that's great. The fan is silent, and since the PSU is so efficient, very nice. Now, but still

**Mouse**: For the love of god, nice scroll wheel, no cons. Good grip, too.

**Mousepad**: *HHHNNNNNGGGGGHHHH.* This thing is FANTASTIC! Smooth, everything I'll ever need. Looks great and has a brushed metal look. Only con I can think of is it does get a little cold in Canadian mornings.

**Keyboard**: Still waiting on the good ol' Quickfire Stealth this month. For now

**Monitor**: Again, I guess.

**Win7**: Had a copy lying around.



I payed around ~910$ for everything


I was monitoring temperatures during sessions of gaming. In BF3 on a 64 man server

**Mistakes made during the build**:

-Forgot to plug in HDD power cable

-couldn't use old optical drive

-forgot to plug in optical drive power cable

When I turned the PC off on my first mistake, you know, like a popped balloon or tire. I thought I killed my power supply. I was crying puddles, all this work and I just blow my PSU? My heart was racing, I thought I was screwed. Until I realized it was just my case door that had closed by itself.

I also had a hard time with the motherboard standoffs. The R4 came with these rubber washers for the standoffs, but decided not to use them for grounding purposes. It was a real head-scratcher but it's all good.

I really have nothing bad to say about this build. *Most* things worked out in my favor and it was a great experience. I was a little nervous during certain parts, and coming from an old 2.something ghz dual core laptop with no GPU, gaming is phenomenal. I plan on overclocking down the line, but on 1600x900 everything runs buttery smooth on ultra, aliasing and all. I'd like to give a huge thanks to everyone on /r/Buildapc, /r/CableManagement and /r/BaPCSalesCanada. It's funny how something like a subreddit can bring people together and share experiences, you guys are the best

[If you've read everything here,  take em' anyways. Enjoy, you guys helped make this come true.] (http://imgur.com/a/acy87)

Oh, mixed with the look of the case.

Also, nobody is waiting. Don't let excitement overcome you and risk screwing something up. Take it slow, and practice good cable management. Also, document your build!

1349243122.0,10v1ql,[Build Complete] 10 Things I Think I Learned About Building a PC,PenName,313,57,223,"This is a bit of a long post

**10 Things I Think I Learned About Building a PC**

10.  There’s no such thing as the “correct” build.  There are definitely ways of choosing and combining parts that make a hell of a lot more sense than other ways, aesthetics and color schemes played a bit more into my parts selection than was probably prudent as a consumer, but I’m happy with how things turned out.

9.  There’s no such thing as a “perfect” build.  There are always going to be better parts that come along and at cheaper prices.  If you wait to buy your parts, great, have at it.  If you’re on a budget, stick to your budget and be happy with your selections.  You don’t really need that heatshrink wrapped quad-channel vapor 7million 2.0…

8.  Zero Insertion Force IS NOT WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE.  Sure, if you haven’t done it before, it’s not a fun experience.

7.  2011 vs. 1155?  As you’ll see below, higher PSU demands, memory, etc.  Seeing as how I’m not planning on upgrading my CPU anytime soon, I’m alright knowing that I’ve locked my upgrade path a bit.  2011 is the way to go if you’re gonna be fiddling and tinkering and tweaking, though.

6.  Get a mobo with error-message LEDs!  I’ve got the Asus P8Z77-V, solved.  Would have been a nightmare to solve without those blessed little lights.

5.  You only need 8GB of RAM for gaming.  If you want to do Photoshop or Video Editing

4.  Gaming isn’t really a CPU intensive process.  You don’t need hyper-threading or 6 cores for gaming.  But again

3.  Your budget on PCPartpicker, it’s only $12.  Oh, and a SD Card Reader, it’s only $18, etc.)

2.  Something is probably going to fuck up- you’ll get a DOA part or the wrong part gets shipped (looking at you, it’ll be easier to handle if you weren’t expecting to be complete for another week or so anyway.

1. This community is awesome and fucking addictive.  Seriously, posts, videos, etc that it made the process of selecting, ordering, and building a PC really, really enjoyable.  If anyone is on the fence about diving in and doing this or not, everyone!

[Anyway

Wanted to build for some time but learning that Dark Souls was getting ported to PC sealed the deal. Overall extremely satisfied with this setup...especially after many years of trying to game on laptops. So far I've been able to run everything I've tried (Skyrim, Shogun 2, Just Cause 2) at or near max settings. The fans provided with the case work pretty well and are quiet. The CPU and GPU can get a bit loud, but I like to keep them as cool as possible. 

As for the build, so I guess it's fine. 

Thanks for all the help BaPc!

Without further ado

If I had to do it again I would probably have just bought her a new case and PSU and paid the difference myself. Trying to work with the old Dell case was far more difficult than I thought it would be. First off, it was also a massive pain in the ass trying to find a place where I could do it (I ended up using the shop in my old high school). Additionally, many of the cables (including the front panel USB cable, the case fan power cable, and the front power button cable thing) weren't long enough for the new motherboard, so I had to do some creative breaking of the case to get them to reach, and I ended up buying a extension cable for the fan. But on the bright side it looks cool and was really damn cheap. I'm also really liking the A6-6400K

**Side Story: The Kool Room**

I had ordered my components in three parts. My graphics card came from some shop in another state (it's hard to find reference cards these days). All of my hardware and water cooling components came from PCCaseGear. My dye came from The Kool Room.

Well, that is, except my dye. I contacted the couriers who conducted a search for the missing consignment. At the same time I notified The Kool Room, who also picked up on the situation and inquired their courier service about the issue. Funnily enough, the manager of Kool Room mentioned in that this was **the first consignment their couriers had ever lost**. Unfortunately, he couldn't send me more dye for free since I did not buy parcel protection (true karma right there), but he did pay for shipping and sent me a nice gift in my package (see album). 10/10 service

**A:** Single monitor gaming such as BF3, DotA2. I also do video editing and rendering for my job, hence the 16GB RAM and i7 (not that I had much choice with the i7 on LGA2011).

**Q:** Why X79 for a single card setup?  
**A:** Because upgrade path. In my long term plans I want to have a particular triple screen setup (primary 27"" 1440/1600p with two 21"" portraits on either side). I would need a second high end graphics card for this. Yes, I had dealt with nothing but LGA1155 platforms in the past, so I wanted to see what 2011 had to offer. Also, the prices for both platforms were quite similar.

**Q:** Why water?  
**A:** Mostly experience. I wanted something quiet

**Q:** Benchmarks?  
**A:** I'm still working on these. [Here's a Heaven 3.0 result](http://i.imgur.com/3P5D2TH.jpg) I achieved at 1225 core / 1800 mem @ 1280mV. My 3820 is currently sitting at a lazy x43 multiplier with stock voltages. I haven't had much time to fiddle around with everything else in great detail yet.

**Q:** How heavy is your computer?  
**A:** It weighs a fucking tonne.

**Problems / Annoyances:**

- My Cougar Vortexes stall on startup if they are set at the lowest speeds via my Sentry Mesh fan controller. I will fix this issue by buying PWM extensions and plugging them into my motherboard. They also rattle a little at high RPM - I'm assuming this is because of their horizontal orientation (I never had rattle issues when they were mounted vertically on my 212 EVO).

- The X2O pump is a little louder than I'm comfortable with. I mean, rather than separate dedicated units. I'm thinking about wiring the molex cable from the pump into the Sentry Mesh fan controller to see if I can control the speeds this way. If anyone has had experience with this before, please let me know. If it doesn't work, I'll probably convert to separate pump/res units if I add a second graphics card.

- The BitFenix orange cable extensions aren't the exact shade of orange I'd like (they're a little dark). I may do some DIY individual sleeving in the future if I'm bored enough.

- The GPU power cables aren't dead straight. Cable braiding will fix this

- My i7-3820 temps are a little higher than I expected them to be. I have already re-seated the CPU block once and gained no temperature drop. The only cause I can think of is the fact that hot water from my graphics card is going straight to the reservoir then to the CPU block. I know it's not an issue with my loop because my 7970 temps are fine (32C idle

___

**Things left to do**

- Orange LED inside the X2O bay pump/res. Might hook all orange LED's up to the button-controlled circuit.

- De-stickering my power supply for a clean black look (kinda scared of voiding warranty)

My two unique additions are a second hard drive and a built-in Xbox wireless gaming receiver. The HDD helped take the pressure of my Steam folder off my SSD. The Big Picture update (and the ability to install games to multiple drives) came out while I was building, and I wired it up to the reset button on the NES case.

My current machine can't really come with me to the US but looks something like this.

---------------

Intel 980x @ 3.9ghz

12gb G.Skill Trident DDR3-2000

2x Nvidia Geforce 580gtx in SLI

ASUS Rampage III board

Windows running off a 150gb Intel SSD

Other drives include a couple of WD Black 1GBs and a WD Green 2gb dump drive as well as various externals.

----------------

I was looking around on PCbuilder and came up with this as a framework. However I have some questions

* Horsepower is important. It saves time in encoding and improves livestream quality due to being able use more CPU intensive presets. At present on my 980x, every ounce will get used somewhere, even if it is to the degree where I can game/record other footage while encoding 1080p stuff in Adobe Media Encoder.

* I do not know much about the difference between Sandybridge E and Ivybridge architecture. I have heard Ivybridge is supposed to release in April

* Price/performance isn't really a factor. The budget for this machine is around $6000 and is flexible.

* I have overclocked before and intend to do so here

* I am currently using a Cosmos case from Coolermaster and I like the fact that it comes pre-sounddampened. This is very useful for recording

* I can wait a couple of weeks at most into April before having to build this thing. Any longer than that and... well I am basically self employed and you know what happens when self employed people take holidays.

_______________

Alright, price/performance is not an important factor, raw power is.

CPU: Intel Core i7 Extreme i7-3960X 3.3GHz 6-Core Processor  ($1044.98 @ NCIX US) 

Motherboard: Asus Rampage IV Extreme EATX  LGA2011 Motherboard  ($429.99 @ NCIX US) 

Memory: G.Skill Ripjaws Z Series 16GB (4 x 4GB) DDR3-2400 Memory  ($449.99 @ Newegg) 

Hard Drive: OCZ Agility 3 240GB 2.5"" Solid State Disk  ($249.99 @ NCIX US) 

Power Supply: Enermax 1350W ATX12V / EPS12V Power Supply  ($283.36 @ NCIX US) 


Could BaPC assist me in choosing parts for this venture? The above parts are a guideline. I am not sure what RAM is really required other than the fact that I need at least 16GB of it (Premiere and Media Encoder can eat up 12 without a problem). 

Thank you for your time.

Hey

I'll be at CES 2013 for media-related endeavors and will have the fantastic chance to talk to several of our favorite (and maybe not-so-favorite) hardware vendors at the upcoming Consumer Electronics Show 2013; I start working on Jan 7 and will conclude interviews on Jan 11

- Intel
- AMD
- nVidia
- NZXT
- ASUS
- SilverStone
- Zalman
- Turtle Beach
- Plantronics
- Logitech
- Acer
- BenQ
- Razer
- Thermaltake
- Rosewill
- Kingston
- LSI / SandForce
- OCZ
- Corsair
- Samsung
- Cooler Master
- Lian-Li
- Many


So... any questions for these folks? I'll be writing numerous articles throughout the show

**/r/buildapc:** Your response has been overwhelming. Working with one of my staff writers, I'll likely post a self.post once I feel I have adequately obtained quality information for your viewing. My plan is to address as many of the most interesting questions in that self.post; anything left unanswered in the self.post might have still been answered in articles or interviews, so always feel free to ask me for an update on your question. 

I will likely either post back at the very end of CES or near the end, or nVidia (all will be conducted on Tuesday, so articles will go live the same day/night) given the sheer number of questions pertaining to their products.",,False,,t5_2rnve,,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/15yfeo/rbuildapc_ill_be_talking_to_all_the_major/

Date of Qualification for fix is July 1st

Statement from Intel

“4th gen Core is on track for a mid-year launch.  Intel issued a PCN documenting a chipset USB errata and stating that chipsets with the errata will be in production during the initial ramp. But Intel has confirmed that there is no chance of data loss or corruption.  This issue has only been observed with a small subset of USB SuperSpeed thumb drives and does not affect other USB peripherals. We take all customer issues seriously and should any customer have a question or concern they can always contact Intel customer support.”

**Edit:** 

There seems to be a lot of confusion whether this problem was fixed or not.

**Aesthetic mods:**

Red glow Backplate: I got the 670 before they made a backplate for it, with a small piece of very thin polystyrene to diffuse the light across the logo. 

All drives are mounted in the 5.25” bays.  I used Scythe “anti vibration” kits from Xoxide (scuffed and painted black) to go 3.5” to 5.25”.  I used a Silverstone 3.5 to 2x2.5 bay converter from Amazon (scuffed and painted black) for the SSDs.  The optical drive housing was also scuffed and painted black.   I modified the SATA power cable spacing to fit the drive placement in one run.

Stealth door on the optical drive using one of the 650D’s aluminum panels.  Soldered in a momentary switch to activate the disk drawer
The stock front 650D fan and the Noctua rear case fan were painted black w/ red blades.

Lighting: Two red LED Sunlight Sticks from Xoxide wired to a PCI slot rocker panel switch on the back of the rig.  I wrapped the LED sticks with a faux etched-glass vinyl film that give them a softer

The Corsair, and NVIDIA logos are print/cut or cut vinyl that I designed in illustrator and had produced by a friend at a sign shop.

Anyhow here's the story:

Started to upgrade my previous build... one thing led to another thing and I was buying computer parts and waterblocks like nobody's business.

It's mainly used for gaming. Runs beyond quiet even under load. Stays extremely cool. Intel has won me over. First PC I ever built had an Intel processor and I've finally come back around after 6 AMD builds. Definitely money well spent.

GPU OCed through maxed-out CCC. Doesn't break a sweat at 1125/1575. Hasn't gone above 54C while playing Crysis 3 with everything maxed out (just to force the system to work for it).

CPU will be overclocked shortly

Mountain Mods makes great cases

Coolant is distilled water w/ some dish soap and dead water drops.  When it comes time to do maintenance in ~6 months I'll probably replace the fittings with Bitspower ones (not that the XSPC ones are bad... although 1 of them did break).


Edit:
The temps are with the fan controllers turned down all the way on each fan.  Ambient is around 30C.

Hello everyone at Build A PC I made my first custom pc and I would like your opinion on it. 
I do not play video games on the highest resolution and all settings. Also I am using a TV that only has 720p resolution and thus my computer runs as 1366 x 768. Games I play Borderlands 2, CS: GO to just name a few.

I already owned a oc-z SSD (SATA 2) 32GB 

Pictures and Game Benchmarks http://imgur.com/a/zOM4B#0  
Need to fix cables for better cable management

EDIT: Stay Tuned Tomorrow and This coming weekend for more benchmarks. I have to go back to school in San Jose State and I only have access to this computer on the weekends. Thanks for the support and opinions on this build. I really wanted to build a custom pc when I was a sophomore in high school but did not have the time or money yet. Waited until College to build it and I gotta say it is the right timing. 
Thanks again everyone at Build a PC!

EDIT2: I changed the case to something smaller [Cougar Spike](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811553011).

Don't know if this has been said before

I have an i5 3570k/ Sapphire 7950 oc(factory oc model) build running 2x1080p asus 23"" LED monitors (one on dvi the other HDMI. Both from the 7950). I only game on one and use the other for convenience of task management. I noticed after adding the second monitor that my frame rate wasn't doing so great in heavy load games. I played around with the OC function in CCC to try and boost performance. I turned it up to around 1050mhz core clock and 1500mhz memory clock

After some research I found that AMD cards (not sure about nvidia) will occasionally not deal well with running a game on one screen and desktop on the other. I'm not the first to have the problem it seems. 

A work around I found was to run my secondary monitor off of integrated graphics and the primary gaming monitor off of the 7950. This fixed everything perfectly.

I run a small computer visualization business and this is the first real piece of equipment I've set up for the job. I have been crunching renderings on my MacBook Pro, and the Adobe Suite.

The dual GTX 580 3gb are for the Blender Cycles engine. The 500-level GPUs were optimized CUDA cards (besides the titan), and I read great reviews of the X-1250. When the time comes, I will also get a full tower case - the R4 is awesome but it's really tight inside with the 580s and the h100i.

Since my last post I've figured out all of the temps. Out of the box

I already own the Razer mouse and the ViewSonic 22"" monitor. It's painful to not own a 1600p monitor with this set up

The build is NOT silent. The stock fans on the h100i absolutely blow...haha...but they sound like a small jet taking off. Also my slim Prolimatech on the side of the case is quite noisy. I'm going to replace all of these with various Noctua fans since the ones I have are wonderful. I just need to save some more money first.

I'm also going to buy an extension for my CPU power cable (you'll notice it's running in front of the components). Does this sub have any recommendations?

That's it! Cheers.",,t5_2rnve,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1hr4l5/build_complete_not_sure_why_my_last_post_was/
1360286398.0,183p2x,I asked Overclockers.com's Matt Bidinger what he thought about the Tek Syndicate  8350 vs 3570K videos. He had some interesting stuff to say. ,lumpking69,342,110,127,"&gt;First and most importantly
&gt;
&gt;Now who is tek syndicate? Minus points here. By doing a WHOIS on the domain, look somewhere with a history and blood in the game. It doesn't inspire confidence when the guy at Tek Syndicate ends the video with ""too many numbers fuck. Numberrrrrs. Ahhhhhhh"". Ya, when doing reviews, you have to properly work with numbers - it isn't rocket science! And ""fuck"" is simply unprofessional. In the bar, with friends, or even on Reddit, fine... When doing your job
&gt;
&gt;Next, they flip flop between presenting 1080 results first and 1440 results first - why? Because they can't keep their numbers straight. If they can't present things consistently in the final product they put all this work into, they probably made other mistakes before it was finished - it is anyone's guess what those mistakes were.
&gt;
&gt;Why did they test with a top end AMD board against a mini-ITX Intel board? The Stinger is a fine board but this testing platform decision is illogical.
&gt;
&gt;What they tested with (One high end board
&gt;FX-8350 w/ MSI 990FXA-GD80
&gt;3570k/3770k w/ EVGA Z77 Stinger mini-ITX Motherboard
&gt;
&gt;[What we tested with (all top of the line)](http://www.overclockers.com/amd-fx-8350-piledriver-gaming-comparison):
&gt;8350 w/ Crosshair V Formula
&gt;3770K w/ Maximus V Extreme
&gt;
&gt;All our tests were done at 1080P
&gt;
&gt;Take Metro 2033 for example. This is the best example that their test was erroneous for gaming performance (their test is only relevant for gaming while running Xsplit). After the results, when running Metro 2033 and Xsplit at the same time, their results on Intel were terrible (possibly because the FX-8350 has more cores to dedicate to encoding under Xsplit).
&gt;
&gt;So the Metro 2033 results at 1080P?
&gt;FX8350: Them - 36.44
&gt;3770K: Them - 27.48
&gt;3570K: Them - 21.2
&gt;3820: Them - 21.32
&gt;
&gt;So on Metro 2033 at 1080P, the 3820 is more similar to the 3770K in core/thread count, yet the 3820 results are more similar to the 3570K results... The 3820 and 3770K should perform similaly due to 4 cores/8 threads, while the 3570K only has 4 cores/4 threads. Their results just aren't logical. The test environment could have been bad.
&gt;
&gt;I looked around

&gt;Maybe read through that thread for further understanding.

I have been reading you and sometimes contributing for quite a while. 

I was extremely frustrated about a month or two ago when everytime (I do mean every single time) anybody posted a build showing 8GB of ram

""You'll never need 8gb

EDIT: Lots of answers about how ram is cheaper now and this and that. I get it. Like I said at that point in time it was something like 20-30 dollars more to get 8gb instead of 4gb. The problem is I saw lots of guys buying mobos with 2 ram slots and getting advice like: Just get 2x2gb instead of 2x4gb.

Now to make financial sense they have to wait until 2x4gb is less than the 20-30 dollars. Do you see what I'm getting at? If you're going to spend 1000 dollars (hell even 600 dollars) on a machine,,False,,t5_2rnve,True,,True

(or just put the word out that you want a dead or dying drive) Ask the seller to send you a picture of the top of the drive. When they send you the pic go to the drive manufacturers website and enter the serial number in the warranty checker tool they they provide. If the drive comes back listed as still under warranty then buy the drive. Most drives have 5 year warranties so your chances are good. Mine was from a friend's computer that died a few months ago. He had since bought a new one. He gave me his old one. This is how I got a re-manufactured/refurbed Seagate 500gb 7200 for 10 bucks. (cost of shipping)    

It will take a couple weeks for you to mail the dead drive to the manufacturers repair center and for them to get it back to you

1373768463.0,1i9452,How to use used parts in your build to save money and get a more powerful PC,SodaAnt,274,50,57,"So, I've learned quite a few lessons that might be helpful for others going the same route. 

1. You're not likely to be able to find the absolute latest and greatest. I've found good deals start popping up around a year after a part is released
2. Check the sellers feedback rating. If they have very few feedback ratings, its usually a good idea to walk away and find another deal.
3. Don't get attached. Often you'll get involved in a bidding war and then realize you've spent a lot more than you originally intended to on a part. You have to be patient, just because it isn't listed now doesn't mean you should just go and pay a higher price. 
2. It really helps to already have some sort of PC you can test the parts you get in. Since you won't be getting all your parts at once, but since the return periods are usually quite short, you want to be able to test that the parts you get work as soon as possible after you buy them. Even if you have to borrow a friend's PC to test some parts, it can be quite worth it. 
3. Some parts are better than others to get used. I've made a list below of the various parts and my opinions on getting them used. 

Motherboards: These are the best things to get used, you can pick up incredible deals. For example, I bought a nice Z68 motherboard for only $55. It was easily three times that new, and it works with ivy bridge processors, and could have easily shaved $100 off of a build. As with my earlier advice, you'll want to wait about a year after a socket comes out before you start seeing good used deals on motherboards. Also, the second you take it out of the box it comes in, and you don't want to get burned.

CPUs: I've not had as much luck with these, so if you were expecting that, you may need to get a heatsink of your own.

RAM: Once again you're not likely to find very good deals here, I'd buy these new. 

HDD: While you can sometimes find pretty good savings, since HDDs are already the most unreliable part of a normal PC to begin with. Once again, I'd advise buying the HDD new unless you come across a very good deal.

PSU: There are good oppurtunities here, run far, far, away, because it is probably utter crap. Since the PSUs you'll find are used, you'll often find that they have a slightly lower efficiency rating than modern PSUs, but for most people that isn't a significant difference. You'll also want to make sure that if you're buying a modular power supply

Cases: Can be good deals, check the shipping first. Beyond that, there's not too much that can be wrong with a case, so if you see something that's a good deal and doesn't have over the top shipping, it might be worth it. 

Video Cards: There are really good possibilities here. I just recently got a 7970 for $250 total. Another good thing to look for is high end but last generation video cards. For example, it will have significantly more power than any video card you can buy new for $100. 

Speakers: These aren't exactly a computer part, if not better, than modern computer speakers, but for half the price. Just make sure they include all the original parts, I've sometimes found ones that don't include the sub, but only mention that deep in the description.

Short Review Section
Gigabyte Z77X-UD3H - Great all around board. looks great. I love the matte black pcb. Because the debug code is really the only thing lighting up in my case right now

Crucial M4 - I new how fast it was going to be but I couldn't really grasp how much difference it makes until I actually got one. This thing is amazing. Quick question.

Gigabyte GTX 670 - Scoffs at whatever games I throw at it. I was really pissed last night because I didn't have any games that could really utilize the full ability of this card. I think it is actually harder for this card to display the desktop than it is to play minecraft. If you look at some of my original posts

Corsair C70 - Love the militaristic styling of the case. Hate the fanholes cut in the window. The handles on top also make this case all the better. They make it so easy to move.

A quick question before I give in to your demands.
 - The HDD SSD combo. How do I format the HDD correctly so I can put some games on the HDD and some on the SSD? Everytime I try to install something on the HDD ""it says invalid location"". I was wondering if there was a way to get around that

tldr; sweet computer, please read the question above, and answer if you can.

My concern is that we have a lot of our resources overlooked until someone directs them appropriately.  We've all seen someone post a question saying 

**""I know nothing about computers and I want to spend some money but I don't know where to start.  Can someone make a build for me?""**  

Inevitably, as well as the other resources in the sidebar.  I was hoping we could avoid this unnecessary step by having a popup show up before submitting a link, much like /r/AskScience does.

3.  POST YOUR BUILD!  So important it needs to be said twice.  Even if you think everything is wrong or you don't know anything we are 10000x more likely to help if you at least put in a little effort

4.  Post WHAT your build is for.  How can we recommend a cpu if we don't know whether or not you are gaming

1354456536.0,145f67,A Guide For Painting The Case,Throwaway_4_opinions,261,48,21,"So about a week ago I asked if people here would like a guide on how to paint a pc case. Needless to say everyone was excited including me as I was going to show you my own written guide. Unfortunately I had camera problems and lost the important first steps to painting a case. 

HOWEVER

I found a very simple easy to follow youtube guide on how to paint your pc case. The guy covers it all from start to finish and even shows some extra tricks you can do if needed to make it look really nice. 

http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4H_vT_EBhZhl8dG8OlxHDU5uBGNhjgyd

Some questions to answer you might ask from the video:

- *Is adhesion promoter a primer paint? -*  No. Think of it more like glue for your primer so it REALLY sticks to the surface. 

- *Do I really need to sand my case before painting it? My case is (brand new/fairly new/pretty clean since it mainly sits on my desk) and at the most just needs to get some dust off of it.* Yes you do! And don't forget to wipe it clean before you prime it. You need to make the surface of your case something the paint will stick to. sanding it will give it that something. 

* *How long do I wait before applying another coat?* Every paint/primer/chemical you apply onto something requires different times. With the paint you give it extra time. If you are putting another color on top of another color wait even longer than the maximum waiting time for applying another coat or finish. 

* *Can't I use paint for plastic on the plastic parts and the other paints for the metal stuff?* You can

* *I hate the glossy look. How do I get that matte finish?* Look for paints labeled flat on the colors. You can also just use really high grit sanding to achieve a matte finish (3000+). Just understand the gloss helps somewhat on the scratch protection factor. 

* *Do I need to use glossy finish if my spray paint is labeled glossy already?* Yes. you need to sand between coats of each anyway

* *Anything else you think is important that I should know?* Two things: First practice different paint designs on tin sheet plating from your hardware store. And second **THE FIRST BASE COAT MUST BE FLAT!**

I plan to still post the finished work of my case. until then I hope this guide helps and will answer any other questions. ",,t5_2rnve,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/145f67/a_guide_for_painting_the_case/

If you run an office they have a more expensive version that can turn one workstation into 8 as long as you have certain connectors.

1362429020.0,19npmi,[Guide] Cooling your System,bballkenn,254,42,77,"This guide is all about cooling your system. I will try to cover temperatures

**Temperatures**

I see a lot of post on /r/buildapc which ask ""Are these temperatures good?"". I will share you my secret when I ever have any questions. [Click Here](http://www.google.com/). Literally you can ask it almost anything and it will give you an answer...

Enough of that rant

*Recommended Max Temperatures* These temperatures are not the real manufacturer maximum temperatures. These are *RECOMMENDED MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE*, may diminish the life expectancy of the component.

* AMD CPU: Around 60°C
* Intel CPU: Around 75°C
* GPU (AMD/Nvidia): Around 80°C
* HDD/SSD: Around 30°C 

*Thermal throttle* Most new generation CPU has automatic thermal throttle. The MOBO decreases the CPU speed

Programs to use to monitor temperatures:

* Intel/AMD: (CPU &amp;amp; GPU) [HWMonitor](http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/hwmonitor.html) Recommended. Shows other helpful information.
* Intel/AMD: (CPU) [Core Temp](http://www.alcpu.com/CoreTemp/)
* AMD: (CPU &amp;amp; GPU) [AMD Overdrive](http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/amd-overdrive/pages/overview.aspx)
* Intel: (CPU) [Real Temp](http://www.techpowerup.com/realtemp/) Very nice program for Intel. Shows information until Max Temp. is reached.

Most GPU's sold today include software which allows for a diagnostic of their GPU. These software can be used of OC and look information about their GPU's, memory clock, fan speed, and even sometimes fan control . 

* [MSI Afterburner](http://event.msi.com/vga/afterburner/download.htm)
* [ASUS GPU Tweak](http://support.asus.com/download.aspx?SLanguage=en&amp;amp;m=gpu%20tweak&amp;amp;os=30)
* [Sapphire Trixx](https://www.sapphireselectclub.com/ssc/TriXX/)

Now if you want to see what the air is like in your case, which temperatures from the probe can be viewed from the BIOS screen.

*What can affect the temperatures*

* Case: Some cases are just terrible for airflow. 
* Cable Management: You basically don't want things getting in the way of airflow. The air should be able to move through the case without being interrupted.
* Fans: The more fans the better cooling
* Components: Basically the more components you have the hotter it will get.
* OC: OC your components will make them work harder
* How you are cooling your components: Basically your components will run cooler with higher end cooling.
* Ambient Temp: This is the temperature of the air. Components would never go below this temperature. If it is hot in your room

**Case Cooling**

*Cable Management*

Picking a case with good cable management, having good airflow will allow for the components to be cooled and heat to be properly exhausted.

*Case Fan Mounts* 

* Back Mount: Exhaust. Since this is the closest fan to the CPU
* Front Mount: Intake. Having the front as an intake and the back as an exhaust
* Side Mounts: Intake. IMO any fans mounted on the side should be an intake. It allows for cool air to quickly reach the components.
* Top Mount: Intake/Exhaust. Some people think exhaust, choose which ever gives you the best results. 

*Liquid Cooling*

This is another whole section by itself. Here is a link to /r/buildapc 100K contest winner

**Case Fans**

One of the biggest factors in cooling your system is the fans you decide to buy. There are tons of options. There are a couple of things you should be looking at.

* Size (mm): Size of the fan
* Speed (RPM): How fast the fans spin.
* Air Flow (CFM):  How much air the fan will push. 
* Static Pressure (mm/H2O): How much force the air pushed will have. More relevant in WC.
* Noise Level (dba):How much noise the fan makes at certain speeds.
* Bearing Type: How the fan was constructed to spin. 
* Power Connector: How the fan receives its power.

Picking a case fan can range from easy to down right OCD. For regular use

*Air Flow vs Noise* With higher air flow, but may come with a higher price tag.

*Static Pressure* Some manufacturers will list the Static Pressure of a fan. Static Pressure is the amount of pressure the air is pushed. High static pressure fans are used for WC radiators. High static pressure allows for the air to be pushed through the radiator fins

*Power Connector* There are 3 basic types, 4-Pin PWM. 

* Molex: The most basic kind. You basically take the power straight from the PSU. This will run the fan at its highest rated speed. No control.
* 3-Pin: It can either plug in through the MOBO or a fan controller. It allows for the monitoring of the fan speed
* 4-Pin PWM: It can either plug in through the MOBO or a fan controller. It also allows for monitoring of the fan speed and adjustment of the speed.

**Cooling your CPU/GPU**

*Stock Cooler*

Its perfectly fine to run a system on stock cooler

*Aftermarket Cooler* (Air)

All the cooler works, and air is used to dissipate the heat. What makes aftermarket coolers desirable is the amount of heat it can absorb and dissipate, it also tends to be much quieter than the stock cooler for this reason. Most aftermarket coolers are paired with fans. 

There are plenty of reviews on aftermarket coolers for you to choose the best one for your system. Remember [Click Here](http://www.google.com/). Use the link wisely.

*Aftermarket Cooler* (Liquid)

There are two types, and Hybrid (Swiftech H220). AIO liquid cooling refers to pre-assembled kits. All you have to do is mount the radiator, fan, and the heatsink. There is no extra work. I would recommend going through the **[Another Custom Loop Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/18uxax/guide_another_custom_loop_guide_enjoy_buildapc/)** for you custom water loops. Swiftech has just released the H220, which is an AIO with the ability to expand. Again I would research the system that would work for you.

Hopefully this covers a lot of things about cooling your system. One thing that I did not want to do is make suggestions, etc. **I also want to stress that if you have a question, it is most likely somebody have already asked it. Instead of asking ""which fan to get"", simply typing ""best 120mm fan"" into Google will get you results.** I know there might be some key information I might be missing or you might still have question. This guide is not *perfect*. I will continue on updating the guide.

1368535248.0,1eb6y1,[Build Complete] $1500 gaming PC,BrutalJones,242,37,137,"Just finished my first ever PC build last night. You guys were [a ton of help](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1dq7eq/build_ready_purchasing_parts_today_1500_gaming/) and I'd like to thank you.

I decided to get back to my roots of PC gaming after hearing the first rumors about the next consoles and seeing the WiiU stumble out of the gate. Always-online DRM? Locking out used copies of games? All of this stuff sounded incredibly restrictive, e-mailing, browsing Reddit, etc. After months of research and plenty of help from you guys this is what I ended up with.

From the very beginning I knew I wanted to build a machine in the NZXT Phantom 410, the Phantom 410 was a strong preference of mine, and I found the gunmetal to be a less ostentatious choice rather than the others available, yet still unique enough to set it apart from all of the other black on black cases out there.
I knew from the beginning that a big focus of this build would be the GPU. The Sapphire Radeon 7970 seemed a highly suggested choice among those more knowledgeable than I

A bit later in the research process I found the idea of overclocking not only to be applicable to my situation with gaming, and I was recommended the Gigabyte UD3H motherboard as a solid board to overclock with. This is also where the unlocked CPU and the aftermarket cooler came from.

Very late in the process I decided that I'd rather spend the money to go with an SSD-only build as well. I found the idea of having one larger, and Netflix/HBO Go for movies), so the 500 GB storage space should be plenty for me. If I still require more, I've got a 500 GB external HDD sitting in my desk drawer that I can always break out. I've only ever used HDD, and I was totally blown away by the speed with which an SSD operates. I don't regret my decision whatsoever.

The bluray drive was a cost effective choice that I made. It wasn't totally necessary

Here are the all important [pictures](http://imgur.com/a/J8IhY). Please note that I realize that these pictures are really rough

That's about all I can think of at this point. Any other questions/comments/suggestions

The build was fairly straight forward with the exception of the power supply not being compatible with the Gigabyte board or Haswell Chip. I did an RMA through EVGA and like always got excellent support and quick RMA process. This alone is why I always will recommend EVGA. After receiving the new PS it installed with no issues and ran up. Since it has been up and running (which is about a week now) I have been having some issues with boot:
 **It will turn on then shut off and will not respond to the power button until I switch the power supply off and wait for power to be removed from the board.... Sometimes this works first try and sometimes it takes 5-10 tries. I don't know where to start. I have resetting all the BIOS and only changing the XMP profile for the memory. I cant tell if it is not getting the correct power cause of Haswell or if there is a component not working correctly causing the issue.**

Would love some direction because it is becoming increasingly frustrating. Other than that is has been awesome with little to no compatibility issues with programs and windows 8. Here is the reddit mark up!

A few notes, it isn't any great improvement over 7 unless you buy into the whole app platform they are trying to base this around- an indicator to me that this is going to be a very touch and tablet based OS- expect to see touch screen monitors appearing on more pre-builds)

That's it

If you want to tell me what you think of it


**Edit: There isn't a release date as of yet

**You can pin running tasks to the side of the screen whilst running another app in the main body of the window (screens to come)**

**You can also install a lightweight version of the OS to a USB drive with ""Windows to Go"" - thanks Duraz0rz**

** ~~I can't find a source to confirm this~~ [Source!](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2012/01/05/virtualizing-storage-for-scale-resiliency-and-efficiency.aspx) but a potential feature is the ability to link hard drives like a software RAID system called ""Storage Spaces"" -Thanks Mac3**

**A few people have mentioned that you can revert to a Win7 style desktop

Other potential ""features are : low RAM usage (apparently 300mb idle)

The last feature is the inclusion of Kinect sensors in laptops that have apparently made it to a prototype stage. I honestly don't think I've heard anything more ridiculous in my life. ",,t5_2rnve,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/qd5er/a_look_at_the_windows_8_beta/

Just a quick note about things I bought and why I got them.

**UP4-** Great mobo for the price

**RAM-** Pretty pricey for RAM

**GPUs-** Was considering a single 780, games I planned on buying anyway. Also, with 2011, why not get the extra card?

**800D**- A quick version of what I did to it is strip it down to bare metal with Aircraft remover, dry and wet, primer, paint. Lots of work, and the process took forever. If you want details, I can get them for you. 

**Optical Drive-** Bought it from a friend for $15

**Monitor-** Got a pixel perfect version, couldn't ask for anything better for the price.

**Mouse-** Planned originally getting a Blue Death Adder to match my keyboard, and the only thing keeping me from getting a Sensei originally over a Death Adder was the price.

**Keyboard-** Wanted a back lit LED mechanical keyboard with blue switches. It fit the bill perfectly

**Lastly, and that compression fittings came with this kit, the cheaper ones had barbs. I did buy white tubing separately, don't care for the clear that it comes with. 

I did my best to use the guide on how to take pictures of your computer that used to be found in the sidebar of /r/gamingpc, had a lot of missed focuses and lighting could be better for a few, but I like the way they came out nonetheless.

And finally last but not least- **PICTURES** [60 picture build log

This is my second pc case that I have designed and made. 

It was inspired by the Aperture Science pc's from Portal. But it has a Raven inspired motherboard layout (90 degree rotated). It is also made from carbon fiber

From first thinking about the design to having it complete

I had the aluminum frame welded by an engineer who likes to make prototypes so we spent a long time discussing the layout of the case and how to make it. The motherboard plate and ""rear plate"" came from a donor case but the hard drive bays

My dad builds yachts for a living so he helped me a lot with making all the carbon fiber stuff. (Quite a farther son bonding experience.)

And then finally I had all the bits sprayed with a high gloss epoxy.

The actual pc components are all just cheap

Hello everyone

Just wanted to mention some feature updates I've rolled out to PCPartPicker recently:

&amp;nbsp;

**Completed Builds**

I've done a good bit of revamping of the completed build section.  There's more fun stuff to come here

* [Easily browse completed builds](http://pcpartpicker.com/parts/builds/) -- Now you can easily browse users completed builds, Case, etc.
* A Reddit Markup button (like with part lists) that will format your completed build with part list, as well as any specifications/temperatures/benchmark results you added.  As the markup language is the same as reddit, all your description text formatting will carry over automatically.
* Voting and commenting - vote completed builds up/down
* Ability to document your overclocking amount, etc.
* Completed build part lists can now be edited/changed

**Saved Builds**

* Like completed builds
* (Coming soon) The ability to annotate saved builds with notes.

**Commenting**

* Reddit-style comments are live on the site.  All completed builds and part pages can now be commented on.
* Like on Reddit
* (Coming soon

**Image Galleries**

* Image galleries for parts and completed builds should be considerably nicer now.  (No more loading every image in a separate tab

**Stickers**

* Not a feature
* I will happily send them to you for free (including internationally), 100% of the proceeds go to benefit Charity:Water.

**Also Coming Very Soon**

* The ability to enter prices for custom parts (and have their links show up)
* Mark parts as favorites so that they always percolate to the top of the list
* Mark parts as owned so that their prices are not counted toward your part list total.

&amp;nbsp;

I've got many more changes on the way.  I'm just coming to the end of week four of doing this full-time

(Though feature improvements are going to have to brief break - UPS just arrived with a BitFenix Prodigy...)

&amp;nbsp;

Cheers

Philip

Hi Everyone


This is my first build! This subreddit has been incredibly helpful


Currently, I never get anything above 70 degrees. I also tried overclocking my Gigabyte 7950 up to 1100/1400, but experienced some monitor disconnects randomly, so I think I'll just leave it at stock settings for now. Any advice on overclocking my GPU?


Feel free to let me know how I did!

1346392488.0,z4fcu,How I built my first PC,Arogar,249,57,32,"This story take place around 20 or so years ago. I had never owned a computer but a friend of mine was in to Amiga's at that time. We talked allot about Computers and games But I didn't tell him that I was about to buy a computer soon. 

The day came and I ordered a PC. I drove up to the gas station my friend worked at and told him ""I have bought a computer!"". His eyes glowed and started to ask ""Did you buy an Amiga 2000 or perhaps a Amiga 3000"" or what ever numbers they had. I don't really remember now. And my response was ""no I bought a PC"". He looked at me like I had slapped him in the face and burst out ""You did not!!!"" Then a rant followed about how bad the pc was compared to just about anything.

A few days later A delivery truck stopped outside and in no time 3 boxes containing my pc was stacked in the hall. I sign and said goodbye to the delivery man. I looked at the boxes and rubbed my hands in anticipation and mumbled something about ""Ohh man Christmas is early this year. 

I hauled the boxes in to my room (I was living at my parent at the time.) and opened one of them. A paper at the top stated that when you assemble this computer the sockets only fit in one place so you can't get anything wrong. That sounded good as my knowledge about computers was low and I had no idea how a PC worked. 20 min later it was all connected up on my desk. ""Great now how do you turn this thing on. There have to be an on button somewhere

The desktop started to make sounds, were is del... Ahhaa found i and pushed it. New thing's cam up on the screen. One row said ""Harddisk Utility""(or something) I've heard about that all programs is in the hard drive so that must be were I should go. Maneuver that blinking thing down to ""Harddisk Utility"". I push enter. A small sign pop up saying ""Do you really want to do this?"" I say something like ""Yes, Yes let me the hell in so I can start having fun with this thing. I maneuver the blinking thing to yes and push enter.

A new pop up with number 1 appear and it's counting 2, and so on. some time later I understood that I formated my hard drive and erased everything on it. So there I sat with a new pc 386 sx16 with a 32mb hdd and 1 mb internal memory. And it's useless. Now every program that was installed also came on disks. First of MS-DOS 5.0 English version with a manual thick as a brick. I'm from sweden so reading that was... Hard. After almost 3 weeks I had deciphered most of it and installed it on my pc and I was so proud of my self for make it work without help.

1361254692.0,18sz1a,Beginner's Water Cooling Guide,SuperLamington,222,30,85,"**SuperLamington’s Watercooling Guide**



[**1. What is Watercooling?**](http://i.imgur.com/usRO9GJ.jpg)
Water cooling is the art of utilizing a series of waterblocks connected by tubing, GPU or Motherboard north/southbridge. RAM is sometimes watercooled, although this is usually fairly useless in terms of performance gain. 
A watercooling loop consists of: 

*	One or more radiators which dissipate heat from the coolant into the air
*	One or more waterblocks which draw heat from the CPU, and transfer it to the coolant
*	A reservoir which is used to store coolant
*	One or two pumps



**2. Why watercool?**
Watercooling can seem like a daunting task, but I also love the aesthetics of a nice loop. Watercooling also gives your computer much more personality – It shows how much effort you put in to making it look/perform, and since your PC’s looks are a bit of a ‘personal statement’ for many computer (hardware) enthusiasts, having a clean, impressive, watercooling loop is the icing on the cake.
Watercooling is also a lot of fun, getting it all up and running, and all that comes afterwards. The process is almost like building another computer, and we all know how much fun that is.



**3. Things to consider (i.e. cases
Watercooling is not for everyone – some people don’t think the maintenance, you must to consider these things: 

1. How much you are willing to spend 
2. What components you want to cool
3. How much room you have in your case. (You must also take into account the support and space your case has for radiators and reservoirs

For about $150, and fans for the radiator.



**4. Brands**
The most prominent brands providing watercooling components/resources are: 
a)	EK
b)	Swiftech
c)	Koolance
d)	XSPC
e)	Watercool
f)	Phobya
g)	Alphacool
h)	Bitspower
i)	Monsoon
j)	Mayhem’s. 

A great place to check for performance reviews is [Skinnee Labs](http://www.skinneelabs.com/) and [Martin’s Liquid Lab](http://martinsliquidlab.org/)


Waterblocks:
When picking waterblocks for you components, and price. The most established blocks on the market at the moment are 
a)	[EK Supremacy](http://www.ekwb.com/uploads/images/EK-Supremacy_NP_front_800.jpg)
b)	[XSPC Raystorm](http://www.xs-pc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/raystorm-intel-11.jpg)
c)	[Koolance CPU-380](http://koolance.com/image/cache/data/products/cpu-380i_p1-700x700.jpg)
d)	[Swiftech Apogee](http://www.swiftech.org/images/products/detail/APOGEE-HD-WT.jpg)
e)	[Watercool Heatkiller](http://watercool.de/sites/default/files/produktversionen/14051.jpg)

The XSPC Raystorm currently has the best performance for price; and the the EK Supremacy has best performance

There are two types of graphics cards water blocks – full cover and GPU-only


When looking at Motherboard North/Southbridge waterblocks

**Remember


**Radiators:**
The [radiator](http://www.alphacool.com/images/product_images/popup_images/1030_0.jpg) (commonly abbreviated as ‘Rad’) cools the water by dissipating the heat from the coolant. Without the radiator, with the average size being 120-360mm, designed for 120mm fans. I would recommend having about 120mm of rad space for every component being cooled; but Motherboards and RAM are an exception as they don’t produce very much heat comparatively. For radiators, skinnee labs have good testing and reviews. I personally have an XSPC EX360 and am very happy with it. I have also heard good things about Alphacool, EK and Black Ice radiators.

There are two measurements important with radiators: thickness and fpi. Thickness is how thick the radiator is and therefore directly affects cooling surface area; and fpi is folds per inch. Radiators are long, radiators with a low fpi require only slower fans, but perform not as well, and radiators with high fpi require fast, and therefore often noisy, fans, but can perform better. Thick radiators have generally low fpi and thin radiators almost always have high fpi.


To decide on radiator sizing
so allowing 120mm of space for all the motherboard blocks combined should be fine. You can do a more accurate estimate by calculating the total TDP (thermal design power). This is a calculation of the heat output of components. To find it

[FPI Comparison](http://www.pmptech.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/FPI-Comparison.png)



**Pump:**
The pump is very important in a loop as it pushes the coolant through the system. Without a pump, and all the other brands simply relabel them. The exception is the [Swiftech MCP35x](http://www.swiftech.org/images/products/detail/MCP35X-BKX600.jpg), which is a custom DDC by Swiftech.’Flow’ is how quickly the water flows through the system, and ‘Head’ is how much pressure the pump puts out.

The D5 pump has more flow but less head than the DDC, so that if one pump fails, the loop still works. Two pumps also increases head a little.

The stock D5 pump has 1/2 barbs and the stock DDC has 3/8 barbs. You can get aftermarket pump tops which give a little better flow and have G1/4 ports instead of barbs. The Swiftech MCP35x comes with an non-stock top.



**Reservoir:**
The reservoir is one of the optional (although highly recommended) components of a water cooling loop. The reservoir is fairly simple – it stores coolant and has some air in it to compensate for pressure changes. A t-line can be substituted for a reservoir

There are two main types of reservoirs – [tube reservoirs](http://www.ekwb.com/uploads/images/ek-multioption-x2-res-advanced1_600.jpg) and [bay reservoirs](
http://koolance.com/image/cache/data/products/tnk-501_p1-700x700.jpg). Almost all reservoirs are clear or have clear sections to show coloured coolant. Tube reservoirs are a long acrylic tube with a cap on either end

Bay reservoirs are small
Reservoirs are personal preference as to which style is used. Generally pumps attached to reservoirs are easier and give a cleaner look to the loop as less tubing is used.




**Tubing and fittings:**
Tubing connects all the components in the loop together and comes in two main sizes: 1/2 inch (12.7mm)


**Fittings**


Barb fittings are basically the same as the gas taps in chemistry labs. It is highly advisable to use clamps with barb fittings to make sure the tubing doesn’t fall off. This shouldn’t be an issue as the barbs are bigger than the tubing (some people like 7/16 tubing on 1/2 barbs so they don’t have to use clamps). A clamp can be a zip-tie

Compression fittings are basically a barb and clamp all in one. The tube goes onto a barb

If you want to use hard acrylic or copper tube for your loop, it has a good seal. The downside for these is that they are easier to have a leak and the tubing must be perfectly straight in the fittings. If they are not straight, there will be a leak. You can either use Bitspower Crystal Link for pre-made acrylic tube, or you can cut and bend you own tubing.

There are also a few other miscellaneous fittings including [quick-disconnects](http://koolance.com/image/content_pages/product_help/quick_disconnects/qdc_pair_disconnected.jpg), [taps](http://cdn2.specialtech.co.uk/spshop/files/detail1/bitspower/wazu_235_1g.jpg), [rotary adaptors](http://www.thewatercoolingshop.co.uk/images/D/64166_0.jpg) and [SLI fittings](http://koolance.com/image/cache/data/products/cnt-vda2-bk_p2-700x700.jpg). Quick-disconnects are two fittings with a compression on either end which join together, when they are disconnected (twist and pull), the coolant doesn’t leak out and it just makes draining loops easier. T-junctions are a block with three G1/4 inch female holes, often used in conjunction with a tap for draining loops easily. Angled adaptors are metal tubing at an angle which has one male and one female hole, rotary adaptors are angled adaptors which can rotate. One should be cautious when buying a non-rotary angled fitting as it might be the wrong orientation when screwed in. SLI fittings are a male to male threaded straight adaptors which have an adjustable length.

**Tubing**
When buying tubing, however, require a specific inner diameter and outer diameter. If you take your time and double check, you will be fine. Plug fittings require only a specific outer diameter.

Another thing to consider when buying tubing is the type of tubing you buy. Tygon

**Coolant:** 
Coolant is a highly debated aspect of water cooling. People deliberate on which coolant looks the best
Distilled/de-ionized water is used in water cooling loops

-	Primochil Liquid Utopia 
-	Mayhem’s biocide
-	PT Nuke

 Silver kill coils are very pure silver strips bent into a coil shape which kill microscopic life inside the loop.
The coolant with the best performance is Dragon Ice Coolant mixture, however all coolants are as they used distilled water, this non-conductive property will wear off over time.

Hi BaPC! 

You know that great feeling you get when you feel like you've accomplished something amazing? It's the first time in a while I've felt it

It's been about two and a half months since I built my first PC. I just really wanted to say thank you for being such an awesome and helpful subreddit. I lurked here for about 3-4 months before I got the courage to go out and buy parts. Even though it was a little scary during the build

I will never forget that feeling of the first time my PC booted into the BIOS; it was one of the proudest moments in my life

This is a self post

Here's some basic things builders should know:

* A good case is always worth it. Having one with good cooling potential (water/air) will reduce noise and temperatures and will increase the lifespan of your components. It doesn't make sense to put $800 worth of components in a $30 case (With exceptions). A great case will last several builds.

Here are some features that make a good case:

* Cable management holes - without it

* Perpendicular drive bays - This makes swapping out hard drives much easier especially if you have something in the pci slots that are in the way such as a video card.

* Screw-less drive mounts - For 5.25"" bays these are fantastic

* Dust filters - A minor convenience. Some people don't like them because they impede airflow but most of the time they are removable.

These are minor details. More often than not if the case has the above features it will have these:

* Case stands (Or wheels) - This allows you to place your PSU fan side down so the fan pulls air from under the case instead of pulling hot air from inside (If this is the case

* Rear water cooling grommets - Even if you think it's no good now

* Thumbscrews - The more the merrier. They don't have to come stock but in my opinion everyone can benefit from a [bag or 2](http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&amp;N=40000255&amp;IsNodeId=1&amp;Description=thumbscrews&amp;name=Case%20Accessories&amp;Order=BESTMATCH). Note that Lian Li cases have a proprietary size for screws in their cases

* Painted interior - Also a minor detail

In my own opinion

**On case fans** - When choosing a case

Usually the general consensus for how to design airflow is to have intake fans from the side and front with exhaust fans at the back and the top. This is known as neutral pressure. Having more exhaust than intake results in negative pressure. Achieving efficient negative pressure is extremely difficult and uncommon. Having more intake fans is known as positive pressure. Positive pressure results in (Supposedly) lower temperatures

Convection (hot air rises) is not to be considered a factor. Even the slowest moving fan will move air faster than heat rising naturally. Also

If you plan on buying aftermarket fans buy them with your build and install them before the other parts as it makes it a lot easier

**On cable management** - It matters

1370935458.0,1g3vwj,"[Discussion] PSA: With all these ""OMG consoles are cheaper than PCs threads"", Please remember that you save hundreds of dollars on games with a PC",okp11,273,83,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1g3vwj/discussion_psa_with_all_these_omg_consoles_are/

**Reasons:**

**#1.**New AAA titles go down much quicker than the same games do on consoles. I suggest browsing /r/gamedeals because there are some  incredible prices on brand new games.

**#2.** Bundles. Bundles Bundles Bundles Bundles. Examples include [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/), and lots more

**#3.** Indie Games. There are exponentially more games by developers that don't make it to console. The vast majority if these are less than $10.

**#4.** Free to play games. There are thousands of them. MMOs, you name it. I mean the most popular games in the world are free to play(Dota/LoL).

**#5.** Steam. Steam summer and winter sales used to be by far the best times to get games. Now they almost seem lackluster with the crazy prices amazon and Greenman Gaming have constantly been having. They still have sales every day/weekend though that can entice even those with hundreds of titles in their library.

**#6.** Free games with hardware purchases. These have gotten better and better over the last few years and you see it with amazing AAA titles that come with almost any video card you purchase. Other pieces of hardware often come with games as well like the free SimCity promotion that is going on with APUs currently.

These are all purely economical reasons to go with a PC over a console for gaming. Obviously there are plenty of other factors like convenience(you never have to go to the store to buy ANY PC game), and plenty of other arguable factors that make it the better choice for gaming if only one can be purchased.

I just wanted to make sure that people realize that just because the up-front cost for a system is cheaper

**Edit**: I want to make it clear that this is not a thread for talking about why PCs are better than consoles. Take that type of foolish banter to /r/PCmasterrace. Obviously the general consensus here is that most of us prefer to game on PCs. The purpose of this is strictly to provide people with reasons why it could very well be cheaper to game on a PC than a console even though the initial costs may be higher. 

Also thank you /u/ultisup for reminding me about emulators

- the placement of power supply at the bottom. I didn't know when this trend started

- cable management. Again a simple innovation that makes a big difference. Wow a few millimeters at the back of the motherboard base gets rid of spaghetti wires! Whoduthunkit?

This is find interesting and comforting at the same time:

- that not much has really changed. Motherboard, CPU, RAM, hard drive, power supply, monitor, mouse, and...internal optical disk! - the same basic components which in my day my fellow builders would discuss on end. Gee I wonder if kids in 2020

I'm glad that CD drives are still alive though. As a 90's kid I would really be sad if CD and DVD games would go away and we go all digital download distribution :(

Sad face moments:(

- Cyrix is gone! The budget processor of my time. And Voodoo is gone too! Voodoo was a beast in it's heyday. 

And I wonder who is the VIA processor today? Ie

So after 4 months of sales and long debate of what to get I have finished my build. Her name is Zadeaquil Epsilon or just Zade.


I have been doing a lot of video editing

I have it overclocked to 4.5Ghz and it is nice and cool. I got some awesome custom sleeved cables from Dazmode. As the video shows I did some other cool mods too.

I went with the X-79 chipset to allow for future upgrades.

The gtx-680 is because I use Adobe CS

I plan on adding 2 more sticks of RAM to make use of the quad-channel the X79 platform supports.

I also plan on adding another GTX680 down the line.

Finally

I haven't overclocked the CPU, but I plan to at some point this week.

I wanted to maintain a black/white color scheme

The Ducky Shine and Sensei RAW also have white back-lighting

I wanted to thank /r/buildapc for all your help

While you can unlock a small percentage of 6950s into 6970s (which is actually somewhat misleading


You have the high end 2GB models for the 6950 coming in at around ~$260

Now you can clearly see the difference is ridiculously minimal (maybe a 5% difference in total). Now given an overclock to reference 6970 speeds on say the high end sapphire 6950
Example: http://www.guru3d.com/article/msi-r6950-twin-frozr-ii-oc-review/22

The above needs to be referenced far more than the spewing of unlocked shaders comments - to prove my point: http://www.overclock.net/t/946027/hd6950-shader-unlock-gaming-comparison 

Edit: Wanted to add this regarding unlocking the cards:
Also as far as unlocks go, which amounts to about 1 FPS). These unlock recommendations are also made to new PC builders, and perhaps folks less knowledgeable on this subject, so the point is completely lost on them.

I'm going to also take a quick second to also point out one other thing that I've seen here recently and is a little misleading.

2GB cards vs. 1GB cards.

Now, especially with multiple monitor setups. If you don't, there is almost zero need, given modern games right now, to get a 2gb card (Dont reference crysis, this is a cop-out, especially on a poorly optimized engine
Reference: http://www.hwcompare.com/6216/radeon-hd-6950-vs-radeon-hd-6950-2gb/ 
Now the argument also comes up, you will never be able to future proof your computer. The best you can do is save yourself time and money and buy something for your needs now.

Anyway I originally built on a tight budget in fall of 2011, along with learning how to sleeve cables, and came out with a product I am very happy with, albeit still very amatuer.  But there is still plenty of work left for me to do on it (Better sleeving/custom cabling, painting the ap-15s, proper res mount and less ugly pump kit).

Cpu very midly overclocked to 3.8ghz

Gpu overclocked to 1225mhz core at 1.25v with 1725 mem clock; only frustrating part for me here was that my card has alot of vdroop

  
Temps relative to ambient room temp Celcius

Idle Temps:    
Water: +5-7  
Gpu: +10-15  
Cpu: +10

Load Temps:     
Water: +10-15  
Gpu: +20-25  
Cpu: +15

Certainly not the best temperatures but I attribute that to the fact I have one rad as intake and the other as exhaust.  After adding push/pull on the ut60 I got a very nice 5C temp drop, silence is great.    




Original Build:

Cpu - Phenom 2 x4 840 (Upgraded to 1090t few months later)  
Mobo - Asus M5a97 AM3+
Ram - some 2x2g PNY Kit
Gpu - xfx black edition 6850
Psu - Ocz modxstream 700w    
Case - Rosewill Smart one midtower  
Hdd - 500g barracuda

Unless someone has a better way, I'll assign the names a number and put it in a random number generator. From there, I'll message [and post, obviously] the winner and get shipping information. Note: Shipping is on me, too.

1368984404.0,1en16c,Haswell and Ivy Bridge-E Info and FAQ. Two week countdown edition!,Skandranonsg,216,33,202,"This post has been copy+pasted from the original thread. Any information introduced in the second thread will be put into quotations

Socket and Chipset Changes:

- **Socket 1150**  
Haswell will be on the socket 1150 platform
&gt;&gt; Socket 1150 is expected to have a 2-year lifespan, will require a socket change.

- **USB 3.0**  
Haswell's USB controller is supposed to be able to achieve the maximum 10Gb/s that USB 3.0 promised. So far

- **PCIe Lanes**  
Haswell will not be able to run 16x/16x on PCIe 3.0. This was obvious

- **Memory**  
Haswell will continue to support dual-channel DDR3 memory. The first time we're expected to see DDR4 on desktop machines will be with Haswell-E. Haswell will natively support overclocked RAM speeds of up to 3200MHz. Why you'd need that kind of speed
&gt;&gt; Haswell will natively support RAM up to 1.5V and 1600Mz

- **SKUs**  
&gt;&gt; There have been a lot of different processor model numbers. In order to simplify the buying process, -K, -R, -S, and -T series).  
There will be no GT0 (without integrated graphics) available on individually sold chips. They will only come on platforms with a dedicated graphics chip built in.

Architecture Changes:

- **On-die VRM**:   
One of the biggest and most significant changes to Haswell architecture from Ivy Bridge is moving the voltage regulation module (VRM) on to the chip itself.  
What does this mean to you? Well, because you won't be at the mercy of shitty manufacturers putting low quality VRMs on your board.

- **Integrated Graphics**  
There are four new levels of integrated graphics available on various Haswell chips. GT1, and GT3e (Iris Pro). GT1-3 are ranked in ascending order of power, with the GT3e rumored to be as powerful as an nVidia GT 650M.  
&gt; For Haswell desktop processors, S, and T series will all use GT2 (Intel HD 4600). The R series will be BGA only, and will use the more powerful GT3e (Isis Pro 5200).  
&gt; Intel HD 4xxx and Isis 5xxx will support OpenGL 4.0 and DirectX 11.1

- **eDram**  
eDram is basically a fourth level of cache above L3. Intel claims that it is large enough and fast enough to hold a frame buffer.  This will be available only on the GT3e platform.    
This means you should be getting far better performance while running on integrated graphics. How it will stack up to AMD's A-series is still up in the air

- **Unlocked Core Multiplier**  
Your maximum core multiplier has been raised from 56 to 80.  
Unless you're cooling with ln2 (liquid nitrogen)

- **Unlocked CPU Strap and Higher BCLK tolerance**  
This will allow for higher overclocks for those that like to tweak beyond the core multiplier. Ivy Bridge and Sandy Bridge were very picky about leaving the BLCK alone
&gt;&gt; CPU Strap can be set to 1.25x or 1.66x

- **Turbo Mode**  
Turbo mode has changed slightly. The only difference is that switching it off put you permanently at maximum turbo frequency.

- **Idling**  
Previously
&gt; There is a new ultra-low power idle state that only consumes 0.05W (as opposed to Ivy Bridge's 0.5W). Apparently this has caused some issues with sleep and hibernate with certain power supplies. Motherboard manufacturers have countered this by disabling this ultra-low idle state by default. However
&gt;&gt; Intel has released a [compatibility list](http://www.intel.com/reseller/psu_selector/) to help you check if you will be able to use your current or future PSU with Haswell.

- **Power Consumption**  
&gt; Haswell desktop chips will come in 3 power consumption flavours. First is the normal and k-series at 84W. Second is the low power S and R series at 65W

- **CPU Coolers**  
&gt;&gt; Socket 1155 coolers will fit on socket 1150.

FAQ

- **I'm a first time builder
That's a tough one that depends on a lot of factors. Here are a few reasons why you'd want to wait for Haswell:  
- If you are an overclocker or want to try overclocking.  
- If you are building a system that will run on integrated graphics.  
- If you need to transfer large amount of data with USB 3.0 on a regular basis.  
If you don't fall into any of these categories

- **Will there be a large performance difference for gamers between Haswell and Ivy Bridge?**  
Early benchmarks seem to indicate that the performance increase is almost negligible. We'll have to wait until the official launch for the final verdict

- **What's coming after Haswell?**  
The next series of processors is going to be called Broadwell, and an increase in power efficiency.

- **What about the BGA rumors?**  
There was a rumor that Intel was going to switch from LGA (land grid array) to BGA (ball grid array), Haswell's socket is LGA 1150. 
&gt; There will be BGA options available, and other small form factor desktops


- **When can I get my hands on one?**  
The official launch date is June 2nd, Haswell's availability will be highly restricted. If you desperately want one on or near launch day, you may have to line up.  
&gt; Intel has not confirmed if this date will be an actual retail availability launch

- **Will Ivy/Sandy Bridge prices drop dramatically with the launch of Haswell?**  
No. You won't ever see deep discounts in processors until they're far beyond obsolete. There is absolutely no reason Intel would give you a reason to buy an older chip.

&gt;&gt; ***New Ivy Bridge-E and Haswell-E Information***

&gt;&gt; - **Socket**  
Ivy Bridge-E and Haswell-E will continue to use Socket 2011. This means that all current X79 boards will be able to be updated to be able to use Ivy Bridge-E chips.

&gt;&gt; - **PCIe**  
Ivy Bridge-E will use the same number of PCIe lanes as Sandy Bridge-E

&gt;&gt; - **SKUs**  
Ivy Bridge-E will come in 3 flavours, and 4960X. The major difference is that the lowest end Ivy Bridge-E will sport a sexy unlocked multiplier.  
Ivy Bridge-E will also sell in SKUs with and without a stock heatsink.

i had decided quite some time ago
But still didn't want to compromise on performance.
Working from home quite often

I'm proud of this build simply because i've spent some time trying to see what others might have done to build a pc in a drawer

Now please comment

Still to be done:
* overclocking
* full watercooling integration
* cable management (some challenges here...)

[Here are just a few images](http://imgur.com/a/26rHZ)


**edit:** prices of the 500GB HDD given by pcpartpicker at $526.55! where it is more like $69.99...


**edit 2:**
After all the comments and questions i feel i should add a bit more here.

1/ I have not bought all these in one go. so some choices were already made as i had them. So the total cost is much less than what PCPartPPicker gives. On this note:

* i7: because i had it for a year. I probably would choose another one today
* 3x500GB 2.5"" hdds: because i had 2 from laptops, as not always true?), more silent and less heat for less volume than a single 3.5"" 7200rpm hdd
* 2 different ssds: because i had them (one from the previous ""version"" of this pc
* 680GTX: had it before release through a friend (so even had a discount...)
* screen/mouse/keybord... well i wont discuss these ones. i'd say personal choices :)

2/ Temperatures: all fine there. 14cm intake (far bottom right) and 3x12cm out (1 mounted on the W/C radiator)

* CPU: between 35C/95F and 40C/104F
* MB: 32C/89F
* HDD: 40C/104F
* SSD: 30C/86F
* GPU: 37C/98F idle and 75C/167F after some long time on load

Building a small form factor PC

---

Everyone tends to default to ATX when speccing a PC

However most people could easily downgrade without missing any of the benefits of a larger case. This can also be much more convenient and there are many reasons why you might want to downsize.

I am going to split this guide into a couple of sections by form factor

---

MicroATX

---

The microATX standard was designed to be backwards compatible with the same mounting holes as a regular ATX motherboard. However

Most microATX motherboards are cheaper than their ATX counterparts in general

Features also tend to be conserved - you will not see a huge drop in the featureset by going microATX

In terms of power supplies

There are some really nice options for microATX cases such as the Corsair 350D (pricey but has a large featureset despite its average quality)

---

MiniITX

---

This is where you have to be a lot more careful

A common misconception is that a smaller form factor will have less effective cooling

However you will only have 2 DIMM slots (max 16gb of RAM) and a single PCIe slot due to size restrictions. Overclocking is often also poor

The good

You will also need to watch for GPU length to ensure that a long

Good options for cases are the Silverstone SG05-lite

Overall the build went reasonably well


The Swiftech H220 cooler obstructed the first of the RAM slots - which was unfortunate as the motherboard manual states that is one that must be populated even if you run with only two sticks of RAM. We had to ditch the LED Avexir RAM that Ryan had picked out (he likes lots of bling in his builds) as it would not fit with the H220 installed. Instead we used some low profile RAM that conveniently came bundled for free when we were purchasing parts. It's as if Newegg knew we would run into that issue...


We had also originally planned on using a Sapphire Toxic 6GB 7970, the GTX 780 only used a 6-pin/8-pin PCI-E power connector set, so we were unable to use our attractive sleeved extension for it. Our cable sleever has since sent us a new cable, but it wasn't feasible to get it in time to finish filming.


Overall the Fractal Design R4 is an attractive case

The custom sleeved cables were made by Reddit user Jappetto. If you're interested in having him make some for you

Some other closing thoughts of my own: 

The H220 was quite difficult to mount on the board.  I believe that this is isolated with AMD motherboards as the intel bracket seemed a bit more intuitive and put together.  The amount of force required to get the block connected to the motherboard was far more than i expected and was somewhat of a hassle.  As Philip mentioned

The Fractal R4 was a nice case to work in


I hope you enjoy the build and seeing my ugly mug on youtube.  If you have any suggestions for future builds

The PC itself is done

Edit*

Adding info from questions below

2tb for storage

I have 3 1440p panels for my monitors.

And the reason I have 680s and not 780 is because I got the first one back in May 2012 and then the other 2 a few months later the other cards were not even announced yet. Also 3 give me smoother gameplay than 2 because they remove most of the microstudder intorduce when using 2.

1367919437.0,1duq5j,[Build Complete] Xeon Beast Reloaded,marekknowak,206,30,100,"Hi guys

I recently posted by new build [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1bo49t/).  Since then

For a start

[Here's my old TJ07](http://i.imgur.com/DGZWBew.jpg) by comparison.

And here is **[the new case](http://i.imgur.com/oJSEKcf.jpg) I selected**.

It is a CaseLabs Magnum TH10

The general idea of the case design is to fit two [NZXT Kraken X60](http://i.imgur.com/XMpVMOU.jpg) 280mm radiator in the bottom pedestal to cool the CPUs.  Because of that

The new case feels much more roomy

 * [10 Corsair AF140](http://i.imgur.com/QLni50a.jpg) in the bottom pedestal to take air in

 * 7 + 1 Corsair AF120 fans in the bottom to pull air from the pedestal

 * [8 Corsair AF120 fans](http://i.imgur.com/P2czvUi.jpg) inside the [120mm top cover](http://i.imgur.com/N6LL6yj.jpg) to push all the hot air out of the case from the top.

 * 4 Noctua 140mm fans to pull the air for the 2x 280mm CPU radiators

 * 4 AF120 [in the front panel](http://i.imgur.com/Zs05Voy.jpg)

 * [12 fans to cool](http://i.imgur.com/otzeEsQ.jpg) the HDDs and SSDs.

The design of the fans is that each air intake is covered by a dust filter

Some fans are controlled by a Corsair Link Unit

The [expansion slots](http://i.imgur.com/JVzFLlc.jpg) are configured as follows:

 * 4 slots taken for the 2 GTX Titan GPUs
 * 1 slot for the Asus Xonar STX audio card
 * 2 slots for the LSI host bus adapters
 * 1 slot for a eSATA + USB bracket
 * 1 slot for a FireWire + USB bracket
 * 1 slot for the [Serial Bus port](http://i.imgur.com/b3lT0oC.jpg) (using it to monitor the UPS).

Total of 10 PCI brackets.

The whole computer is powered by a EGVA SuperNova 1500W power supply.

Some other thing to note is that with so many devices requiring a USB header on the motherboard (Power Supply, Corsair Link, front USB ports, PCI brackets), I had to install two [NZXT IU01 USB Expansion](http://i.imgur.com/HHLMEIT.jpg) so that instead of 2 USB headers, I end up with 6 + 4 internal ports.

And yes, since I just don't have the patience to try to put nicely all cables and extension to plug 44 fans and 28 HDDs and SSDs in a tidy manner.

Spending the time to build the computer was all I could afford of computer downtime.

The full specs are as follows:

 * CPU - Dual Xeon E5-2687W - 3.1 GHz - 8-core
 * CPU Cooler - 2x NZXT Kraken X60 with 280mm radiator
 * RAM - 64GB Hynix DDR3 Registered ECC RAM
 * Motherboard - Asus Z9PE-D8 WS
 * Graphics - 2 x 6GB NVIDIA GTX TITAN
 * Case - CaseLabs Magnum TH10 with Pedestal and 120mm top cover
 * Audio - Asus Xonar Essence STX
 * Power Supply - EVGA SuperNova 1500W
 * 2x LSI SAS 9207-8i host bus adapters

Storage:

 * Intel 520 Series SSD (480GB)
 * OCZ Vertex 4 SSD (512 GB)
 * 2x OCZ Vertex 4 SSD (256 GB)
 * OCZ Vertex 2 SSD (256GB)
 * OWC Mercury Extreme SSD (200GB)
 * 4x Samsung 840 Pro (512GB)

= total ~4 TB of SSD storage

 * 7x 4TB Western Digital WD4000FYYZ RE (total 28 TB)
 * 5x 2TB WD Green drives
 * 2x 1TB drives
 * 2x 500GB Hitashi HDD

total of ~41 TB drives

 * Asus BW-12B1ST Blu-Ray Writer

Case accessories:

 * Corsair Link Cooling Kit
 * 2x NZXT IU01 USB Expansion
 * Matrix Orbital BLK204-7T-1U-BK-USB-TCI-E
 * Lamptron FC-9 50W fan controller
 * 3x Icy Dock ToughArmor  4x2.5"" SAS/SATA HDD Hot Swap Mobile Rack (replaced the 40mm fans with Noctua fans)
 * 4x Icy Dock FlexCage Tray-Less 3x3.5"" in 2x5.25"" SATA HDD Cage (replaced the 80mm fan with Noctua fan)
 * Icy Box 5 drive backplane (replaced the two 60mm fans with Noctua fans)

And many many Phobya fan splitters.

It's Windows 8 which I think is great for a new pc. Provided your bios and graphics card are updated correctly &amp; compatible you can experiment with some new options like Ultra Fast Boot.

All you need to do is download a Windows 7 trial from [here](http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/OS-Enhancements/Windows-7.shtml). and burn it to a disc or flash drive (assuming you don't already have a copy).

Then [follow these instructions](http://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2012/10/30/microsoft-website-loophole-lets-anyone-buy-windows-8-pro-for-just-15/) (basically telling a fib about when you bought your computer and/or the model).

*Confirmed working* as of a few days ago. People. Just do it. You get a key in your email to use forever. Don't be a cheap ass an try to split $15 on two computers. Just buy another.

I bought two 6950 2GB's Tuesday night for my new PC, so when I log onto Newegg out of curiosity today to check if the prices went down on anything I bought, I saw that my exact model of 6950s NOW contain a copy of the new Deus Ex game (I am a HUGE fan of the original game), and I was pissed.

I called Newegg on a whim to see if I could possibly trade in my Dirt3 code for a Deus Ex code. After having trouble understanding me at the beginning, but then right as I had to hang up to go to work, he finally told me that because I was a new customer, he was able to MAIL ME two codes for Deus Ex: Human Revolution, for free, and let me keep the two Dirt 3 codes as well.

I am absolutely amazed that this happened. Needless to say I took time to do the phone survey and I will certainly not stop using Newegg in the future. This totally makes up for having to wait until Monday for my parts because they shipped from California.

tl;dr- bought two 6950's with Dirt3 gift; gift changed to Deus Ex right after I bought them; called Newegg and support guy sends me two codes for Deus Ex: Human Revolution for free

**Note**

I bought EVERYTHING from microcenter because I went all the way there just to get the CPU and MOBO (because of a combo deal) so I just picked up everything to kill two birds with one stone. In all it came out to ~$700 (with tax)

------------------------------------------------------------------
**Reasons for what I bought:**

-i5 2500k
and the i5 in my mind is an amazing CPU.

-Hyper 212 plus

-Gigabyte z68 ud3h

-Corsair vengeance RAM

-WD Caviar blue 500Gb

-Corsair 300R

-Corsair 600w PSU

-Lite-On drive

---------------------------------------------------------------
**My overclocking story (not that interesting):** 

I overclocked the i5 within a few mins of searching and I got it to 4.2Ghz no prob. (and not changing of any settings on the mobo) but then I tried for 4.5 and I blue screened

First, [Troubleshooting] and [Build Complete] posts should be done as a text submission.  There are no exceptions.  If you see them as a link submission please report them to the mods so we can remove them and inform the poster that it needs to be resubmitted.

Next, if you do have an awesome picture or story you would like to tell feel free to submit it as a text submission.  The more details you provide, the more the community can learn and discuss together.

This bring me to my final point.  Our sub is a congregation of tens of thousands of minds with one simple goal - build computers, PLEASE direct them to the sidebar or offer your advice.

Please note we will also be tossing in a stylesheet update and a rework of the sidebar as well as the create a submission screen as well.  This will go live within the coming weeks ahead.  Additionally, or tutorials.

My own opinion

First, that you can really ""future proof"" a system. Even the x79/LGA2011 route is going to break down next year (DDR4 support will force chipset change at minimum).

- Approach #1 - Go big or go home.  Basically you build the best rig you can afford and ride it out until either the software platform (Windows, but usually that's changing to a new GPU or adding more memory, things of that nature.

- Approach #2 - Build for upgrade. Here you build a system with the objetive of changing components over time. You start out with a cheaper CPU, etc. and plan to upgrade pieces to keep the system ""usable"".  This requires a smaller budget up-front and some intelligent research to make sure you buy components that allow for upgrade/expansion.

In my experience, you can build a system that you're happy with and works for a few years without needing any attention. (Obviously you Can upgrade, but you might not Need an upgrade).  

On the other hand, with the intention of saving up for that kick-ass GPU in 3 months (or whatever).

Your comments

EDITS/UPDATES:

Great discussion everyone

Obviously everyone has their own opinion

**1. Approach #1 seems to be generally preferred vs Approach #2**
 
**2. Budget plays a strong factor in the decision. If you want a really nice system but only have $500

**3. As for Approach #2

I think the discussion has pretty much run it's course. Thanks to everyone that joined in and shared their opinion!

**The Concept**

The concept was simple - I wanted a gaming/all in one PC that would play whatever I threw at it at High/Ultra settings, which was closer to $1200.00 after sales.

**Component Selection**

I went with the **Corsair 550D** mainly because I wanted something quiet with sound deadening materials that also looked great.  I'm not into a lot of flash when it comes to cases.  The Fractal R4, and I got the Corsair 550D for a great price.  The case is high quality case and I'm quite happy with it.  Its extremely quiet as well.  I barely hear it at idle and when fans start to spool up its still extremely quiet and you cant hear it over speakers or headphones.  Building in it was wonderful.  MB risers were pre installed, and drives snapped into place without needing screws.  It had plenty of wire pass throughs as well.  In the future i'll probably add some silent case fans to replace the fans that came stock with it to try to bring the decibel levels down further.

I chose the **Gigabyte Radeon 7950** as the 7870XT wasnt available anywhere, but The Sapphire model I wanted was sold out everywhere for weeks, so I decided to take a step up instead of a step down.  The reviews also noted how quiet the card is, and I have to agree.  Its very quiet.  3 Fans=better cooling=slower fan speed to keep cool=quiet operation.  So far I've only been playing Bioshock Infinite on it and it runs at Ultra settings with no hiccups or problems.  

I also went with an **SSD**, it makes a world of difference.

I went with the **Gigabyte GA-Z77X-UD3H** due to the great reviews and I've read its a solid motherboard and a good overclocker. Honestly

The **3570K** and **Coolermaster 212 EVO** were picked for gaming and to allow overclocking should I want to fool around with it.  the **RAM** wasnt something I did a lot of research on

As far as the **XFX PSU**

I went back and forth on the **Dell U2312HM**.  I was using a 20"" LCD Dell 2001FP from 2003 (16ms response time) and my original plan was to keep it and continue using it.  But the more I thought to myself, not spending an extra couple hundred on a quality monitor seemed silly.  I knew instantly I wanted an IPS panel.  I know what you're thinking - gaming?  Should've gone with a non-ips panel.  Well, I can tell you that the U2312HM has been great to game on so far.    I havent seen any ghosting with it or any lag, at least none to my eyes.  [See the TFTCentral Review](http://www.tftcentral.co.uk/reviews/dell_u2312hm.htm)  When I first turned it on and booted into windows I knew instantly an IPS panel was the right choice.  The difference between by old monitor and new was significant.  Colors really pop on this thing and my first entry into Columbia on Bioshock allowed the monitor to really show off.  I dont mind the anti glare coating on it either, as I was used to it on my old dell monitor.  If you guys are using a really old monitor and dont have a new monitor figured into the cost of your new build, I recommend you do so. I got this dell on sale for about $190.00.

**Temperatures**

Idling temperatures of all 4 cores are sitting at low 30s (fluctuating 29-32c)

Room temp is 72.

After 25 minutes of prime95 in blend mode:
Core 0: min 30 max 55

Core 1: min 31 max 61

Core 2: min 21 max 55

Core 3: min 27 max 56

It looks as though I'm seeing core 0



Well

Run Silent

* Total was a cool $800. Everything in the PC was bought new for this build except for a 60 GB SSD that I was gifted a while back. My advice for upcoming builders: pick out a tentative system configuration a month or two before your planned build

* Here's some [photos!](http://protocolsnow.imgur.com/1V0O9)

I also realize I need a bigger desk. I have a dust problem in my apartment so I'm being nice to my PC and putting it on my desk for now.

* System config is a very typical P8P67, GTX 460, Spinpoint F3, 60 GB SSD, packed into a Fractal Define R3 case. I was aiming for the ""sweet spot"" in price/performance.

##Water Cooling Guide


##Introduction
The purpose of this guide is to give readers the basic knowledge required to select, how they are assembled and how to maintain them. This guide is not, and will never be, 100% complete.  As technology continues to advance, new solutions for old problems will arise, new problems with new solutions will need to be addressed, and this guide will slowly become outdated.

With that said

##Purpose of Liquid Cooling In General

*Just a little preface before you start reading: I will be referring to “Water Cooling” as both “water cooling” and “liquid cooling.” I like to use “liquid cooling” for general ‘cooling with a liquid’ and not necessarily PC related

A very important part of any process is figuring out why you're doing it in the first place. Lots of people are going to read this and ask “Why the hell do you need to go through all this trouble when a good air sink would be just as effective?” Liquid Cooling something is far more difficult

The purpose of Liquid Cooling varies from implementation to implementation. Speaking generally

- Relocated or reduced noise and heat. The ability to move heat exchanger to other locations is pivotal in some implementations. Most cars
- More heat capacity. Most Liquid simply has the ability to hold much more heat than metal
- Efficiency. Liquid radiators are more efficient at transferring heat to the air compared to conventional air sink fins.
- Size. Water blocks are almost always significantly smaller in physical size compared to air sinks. This can allow for very thin and small hardware implementations while still being able to dissipate heat effectively.
- It looks pretty damn cool. This one is mostly for computers

In addition to those advantages

- It's complicated! As mentioned in the first paragraph
- It's expensive! Any Liquid solution is going to be significantly more expensive than a comparable air solution. This mainly because there are many more separate components in a Liquid loop compared to an air sink.
- Maintenance. A water loop requires much more maintenance compared to an air sink. This requires time and patience.
- Water spills. I saved this one for the end for a reason. If you can follow directions and not do anything stupid, even if there are spills or leaks.

Depending on how you want to assemble your loop, of the disadvantages.

***Please note: Before you go any farther, read ENTIRELY through this guide before starting this project. Ideally, you should do even more research past the information contained in this guide.***

***I, it’s meant to aid in the first step of this process: research. Nothing more.***

##Overview of Water Cooling Components
To start off the main part of the guide

##Water blocks
Water blocks are used to transfer heat from the source into the water. They are essentially heat exchangers that move heat energy to the water from the heat generating component.

Water blocks rely on surface area and flow rate to transfer heat quickly and effectively. Just like air sinks

To add surface area, a water block will make use of any one of those 3 concepts. There is no single best solution for a good water block, so don’t ask about one. Your best bet is to look at reviews and other data.

The restriction of the block is often a metric used to compare blocks. This is a measurement of how much water can be pumped through the block in a given amount of time. High restriction blocks often perform better with a more powerful pump and a loop of it’s own. Low restriction blocks may sacrifice performance

This is a minor concern in reality

###CPU Blocks
CPU water blocks are the most common type of block

CPU blocks make use of pins and fins mostly. Some CPU blocks are designed with channels

They attach to your motherboard just like any other aftermarket heatsink

###GPU Blocks
GPU blocks are designed to fit on your graphics card. There are 2 main types of GPU blocks:
Full cover GPU blocks are designed to (as the name suggests) fully cover the GPU PCB. Blocks of this type often support a single card and PCB design. They cool the GPU core
Universal GPU blocks are often designed to fit on any GPU. They may include brackets for many different types of mounting scenarios
Because universal blocks only cool the GPU itself
###Chipset and Other Blocks
In addition to cooling your GPU and CPU

Chipset blocks are similar to GPU blocks. They come in universal and board-specific versions. Board-specific blocks are almost always limited to a single motherboard version. Board-specific blocks are very rare

Other places people have put water blocks are:
RAM. Most RAM blocks are custom designed and rather expensive. Nowadays
Hard Drives. Yes
PSUs. There have been a few PSUs that have connections for water loops. Again

##Pumps
Pumps are responsible for circulating water around your loop. They often vary in physical design and size

###Pump Measurement Figures Explained
Pumps are categorized and measured with

Flow rate is the measurement of how much liquid a pump can move with no restriction. Usually measured in gallons/liters per hour

Head pressure is how hard or high a pump can push liquid at full load (with 0 flow or 100% restriction). It’s measured by seeing how high a pump can push water through a thin tube and is usually measured in feet or meters.

A pump with lots of flow is useless if it can’t push that water through minor restrictions. Similarly

###Common Pump Designs and Implementations

The most common pump today is a variation on a single design

Because of it’s reliability and effectiveness

Chances are

Other pumps have more powerful motors or other features that can’t fit inside the DDC form factor

##Radiators and Heat Exchangers
Radiators and heat exchangers are technically the same thing (a radiator is a heat exchanger). They are designed to transfer heat from one substance to another efficiently. However

Simply put

###Radiator Measurement Figures Explained
Water cooling radiators come in all shapes

Unless you want a passive radiator or non-water cooling radiator (like a heater core from a car

Therefore, you also have doubles, triples and even quads. Some companies even make radiators meant to hold 9 120mm fans in a big square! Of course, just because 120mm fans are the most common doesn’t mean that they are the only fans around, you can find radiators that take any size fan you want.

Additionally, determines what the ideal type of fan you want to use on the radiator is. Thickness is measured in mm and comes in all sorts of measurements, the thickest I’ve seen being 80mm and about 20mm for the thinnest. Fin density is measured in FPI or Fins Per Inch. 30 FPI is on the high side while 5-10 is low.

Thicker and denser radiators ideally need fans with high static pressure to push air through the fins. Thinner radiators with less fin density perform better with fans that have lots of airflow.

###Common Radiators and Designs
In addition to shape, some radiators have other features that are worth mentioning.

Some radiators are “Crossflow” radiators

Some radiators also have different fin materials and paint. These can affect performance and other thermal characteristics

###Shrouds
Some people (although I haven’t seen many people doing it anymore) like to put shrouds between their fans and radiators. A shroud

You can go with or without shrouds,,False,,t5_2rnve,1361333252.0,,True

My current idle is at 35c with an ambient room temp of 24. The SP120 fans are connected to the Corsair 600t's fan control. As of now, I keep it at the lowest setting so the temperatures can be better if I decide to bare with the sound of the fans.

Hi /r/buildapc 

As it stands right now

2xRAM Advantage:

* the ""if one fails you can at least have a working computer while the dead stick gets an RMA"" argument  
* is slightly faster  

1xRAM advantage:

* more space for upgrades (especially useful if you have only two slots for RAM on your motherboard)
* usually cheaper  

8GB of RAM is considered ""more than sufficient"". So running 1 x 8GB should not result in anything written to the paging file (loss of performance from something other than single vs dual channel). I would have liked to perform the 2 x 4GB test

All tests were run with the XMP profile enabled in the BIOs (1.5v, my system specs are as follows, I left the CPU at stock for the test:

1368114077.0,1e08jv,Requiring sources for claims?,NeoDestiny,273,107,156,"I know it would be a lot of work, but I believe it's truly detrimental for people who genuinely aren't knowledgeable about computer parts when they open a thread and see a bunch of possible misinformation going around.

I'm not trying to name names or call anyone out in particular, it's not just for ""quality of life"" reasons, but more-so because I feel that people who are inexperienced with parts could be mislead by reading certain threads.

I'm sure quite a few of us had a good laugh at [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1dw2ms/build_complete_nice_computer_bad_cable_management/) thread because the poor sap obviously wasted quite a bit of money. I thought it was fairly funny

&gt;Power Supply: Someone told me that running a power supply at about 50% load maximizes it's efficiency.

Even though this isn't necessarily true (and definitely isn't something you should encourage people to do - buying a PSU that's 2x as much as the **maximum draw** on their system)

Did this one particular guy get completely fucked out of a decent system because he was unlucky and stumbled into the wrong threads?

I know that it's on the customer to do more research, a lot of (see: **most**) new consumers probably couldn't tell you the difference between a 7970 and an 8800GTX. Or what the difference is between an SSD or an HDD. Or what all those blasted numbers mean behind a processor (a 3320 intel chip is way better than a 2700k because the number is bigger! a gtx 630 is obviously better than a gtx 580, etc...etc...).

The only possible cons I could see to requiring a source for a certain claim (ie: no, or an i5 will be just as good in a gaming box as an i7, etc...etc...) is that it might discourage some people from posting, but if those people are too hesitant to find benchmarks, or are even unaware of their existence, are they people you'd want giving advice anyway?",,,,

I can't get a straight answer on whether 64GB RAM will work properly. Seems to be a lot of conflicting information out there on whether going over 32GB will mean that the other 32GB has to be paged in and out of the CPU's memory space (like the weird shit we used to have to deal with to access &gt; 1MB on our old 286s etc).

**Build Day**

The build itself was relatively painless; the hardest part was installing the cpu cooler without removing the motherboard (I initially could not find the included thermal paste so I used the stock cooler because i didn't want to wait for shipping.) Getting the audio header to fit was also a struggle


**Overclocking**

Because I had to wait for the windows 7 disc (I got it from my university) I settled with vista, any higher setting wouldn't load. I didn't like the temps I was getting at that setting though (it was consistently higher than 70C under load) so instead I set the multiplier at 42 and I worked up voltages from 1.16v vcore until I found a stable setting (4.2GHz @ 1.18v vcore). this was my first time overclocking so i was nervous but I am happy with the results I got (temps at about 63C under load, they can spike higher but that is rare).

I started saving for this build last fall, and of course, the lighting. The i5 only gets to 4.2ghz at 1.2 volts, but I'm ok with that, I don't really need it to be insanely fast. All the fans are at 5v using the case's fan controller, and it's mostly quiet. Saving up over such a long period of time got me some great deals, like the storage, and power supply (which may be overkill

I'm super happy with how this build turned out

I chose the last names of the members of the team at the video game website [Giant Bomb](http://giantbomb.com/), as they all have pretty interesting last names (Gerstmann, Caravella, Shoemaker, Scanlon, Snider, as he recently left the Giant Bomb podcast in the process of moving to Chicago.*

*Unfortunately, [we learned of the death of the recently-wed Ryan Davis](http://www.giantbomb.com/articles/ryan-davis-1979-2013/1100-4685/). It's a really odd feeling when someone you care about, yet know of only through the internet, passes away. I never realized how much I really cared for him until he was gone, and honestly it still feels like I'm about to wake up for a bad dream. In the last several years of my life, listening to Ryan and his colleagues on the bombcast has had a huge impact on my sense of humor and taste in video games. Although I've never met the man, I'm glad to have been able to watch and listen to him for most of my adult life.*

We decided to do a Mini-ITX build for lulz and convenience.  To fit the PSU in, we took a piece of paper and placed it flush against the back-side of the PSU (after cutting holes in it to let the power socket and switch through).  Then, we used a pencil to poke holes through that mask.

The components did fit closer than we expected, we overclocked the rig to 4.5 GHz stable (I think we could have easily reached 4.6 without hitting TJ Max), though we pushed it down to 4.4 to lower temperatures to a more friendly range.

Lessons Learned:  

* Mini-ITX builds are do-able by average people.  This was the second build I had done in a year
* Compactness doesn't necessarily mean really high temps.  If I recall correctly, I think he got a really good 4670k.
* While three screws _should_ have in theory forced the PSU to align to the chassis in right angles (you can see a slight bend, though we solved this issue by routing cabling under the psu, which actually pushed it up.  I feel this is a temporary hack, and we're probably going to add some reinforcing piece of metal that would push up on the PSU and be secured by a side-panel hole.  

Additional Notes:  
  
* The Realtek audio drivers caused hard resets (without BSOD!).  Event viewer showed kernel power failure events
* The lack of an ODD was a choice we picked early on.  We left SATA3 power and data connectors on the side (between the GPU and the PSU) and used them to install windows with an ODD ripped out of my desktop.
* I honestly think the RAM should have been dropped down to 8GB.  We ultimately stuck with 16GB as a ""just in case"" sort of thing.

Final notes:  

We had a lot of fun! My friend was really hesitant about touching components at first, but in the end, it was fun and that made it worth it.  ",,False,,t5_2rnve,,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1j6tnb/build_complete_11001200_miniitx_gaming_rig_w/

I'm getting all my parts from Memory Express here in Canada so I don't have to spend money on shipping. But basically, I have been wasting away, just waiting for the time until I meet her again. I am 71 years old and have absolutely no knowledge with computers, let alone building one, but I am very eager to learn! My grandson showed me the YouTube video to the side explaining how to build it and it seemed fairly easy to do (at least, the man made it seem easy - hopefully I'll find it easy as well). I learned how to use the Internet (I have all the time in the world) and I'm very determined to learn this one as well.

1348193942.0,1087uc,Computer Monitor Guide,Colemaj,185,26,59,"I recently bought a monitor for the first time in over a decade. I'll admit

**Determining your goals and setting a budget**

It's important to identify what you're going to be using your monitor for, and for many is an important part of the computer experience. There is no point in running dual 690GT's through an 18 inch LCD from 10 years ago. Some would even argue to pick your monitor before you choose your parts, than pick a video card to match and build your system from there. 

**Basic monitor terminology**
It's worth mentioning that there industry wide standards for a lot of these measurements don't exist. It's important to take them with a grain of salt. Furthermore

* **Resolution**: This is the number of pixels wide by high (e.g. 1920x1080). Higher resolutions will tax your graphics card more

* **Size**: The *diagonal* size of the monitor in inches. Larger monitors will often have higher resolutions. 

* **Response Rate**: How long it takes for a pixel to change from black to white. Lower response rates are desirable because they enable the monitor to better display fast moving images without ghosting. You generally won't notice anything lower than 12ms for everyday use

* **Input Lag**: This is how long it takes for the monitor to react to input. Some IPS monitors will have high input lag

* **Viewing angle**: The maximum angle at which your eyes can be with respect to the monitor and still have it look nice. Large viewing angles are important for large monitors, but if someone could double check it would be greatly appreciated. 

* **Contrast Ratio**: Ratio of the brightest whites to the darkest blacks. Monitors don't typically exceed 1000:1 contrast ratios but a lot of manufacturers have started measuring ""dynamic contrast"". Dynamic contrast should be taken with a grain of salt


* **White Point**: This is the ""temperature"" of the screen. This is not a change in heat

* **Black Depth**: This is kind of the opposite of the white point. It's the minimum level of black your monitor is capable of showing. No monitor can put out a complete absence of light (except black hole monitors

* **Refresh Rate** Usually subdivided into vertical and horizontal. This is how fast in Hz (Cycles/S) a monitor can draw an image. This is different from framerate because it includes drawing the same image twice. If your graphics card is lagging at 15 frames/s a monitor at 60 Hz will draw each frame four times before the next frame is loaded. The rods in your eyes experience flicker fusion (images becoming smooth motion) at 15 Hz but the cones can go as high as 60Hz. As such

**Color Gamut**

This is particularly important for graphic design/photo editing folks. You may not have noticed it, therefore, won't be able to show 65% of the colors that exist. Above that is a AdobeRGB which was developed to set a higher standard. Adobe RGB covers 50.6% of the color space, and above that is Adobe Wide-Gamut RGB which covers 77.6% of visible colors. NTSC color gamut is the percentage of theoretically possible colors to display, and is typically the measurement you see. A run of the mill monitor will be ~70% NTSC color gamut which is totally fine for general day to day use. Professionals will need a much higher color gamut &gt; 90% to properly display their work. Regardless of the monitor you buy, make sure to calibrate your colors. 

**Panel Types**

There are typically three types of panels used. TN+ and IPS are the most common, many people feel that it winds up being the worst of both worlds. If your'e interested in a VA type monitor, MVA panels are becoming increasingly viable and might be a good starting point. In fact, MVA have the best contrast ratios ever tested. If you're doing regular web browsing or gaming, a TN monitor might be best for you. If you're doing a lot of photo editing or have a huge display, an IPS monitor might be ideal. For multiple displays, TN monitors will work (to save money) but you'll want to tilt them to overcome the poorer viewing angles. These are of course not absolutes

**3D monitors**

3D monitors offer 3D support for video games and movies

**DVI vs. HDMI vs. Displayport**

DVI is pretty much your standard computer to monitor connection, make sure you check to see that your video card supports it. 


**Back-lighting**

Monitors use either CCFL (Cold Cathode Fluorescent tube) or LED (light emitting diode). While their are different types of LED backlit monitors, use less energy, and are are thinner. For color sensitive work, CCFLs tend to have better color representation over a wider gamut, and are typically preferred. One caveat to LED backlighting, Edge lit backlighting tends to be less uniform and less ideal than full-array backlighting. Sometimes you wind up with bright edges and dim middles if the diffuser are cheap. Full-array backlighting is typically either an array of white lights or an array of RGB LEDs. The latter is more expensive but may be be better with color representation as it is more dynamic in terms of the color of the back-lighting. Think of it as a monitor within a monitor.  

**Glossy
This is largely a matter of personal preference. I hate glossy displays, if you don't have to worry about glare you might really like them. It's good to look at different monitor types in the store (ideally the one you're considering) to see what you like best. 

**Which monitor depends on the purpose**
To start choosing your monitor

* General Computer Use: TN monitors from good brands

* Gaming: High Brightness, though IPS panels are a must if the monitor is large. IPS monitors have gotten much better over the years and competitive for gaming, most gamers will likely prefer them. Very extreme FPS gamers, or those who would rather spend the money on their rig might still prefer a TN panel.

* Graphic Design/Photo Editing: IPS monitors are necessary to see the full range of colors and have a wide viewing angle. Plan on budgeting a large portion of your computer money for your monitor. 

* Movies/TV: Low black level

**Korean Monitors**

One way to get amazing monitors at a cheap price is by picking up korean monitors on ebay. This is a Korean brand that by all accounts are amazing monitors but are unavailable through traditional merchants. You can essentially get good IPS monitors for as low as 50% of what you would typically pay for them. He'res links for in depth information for [Catleap](http://www.overclock.net/t/1225919/yamakasi-catleap-monitor-club), here's a really good [general guide](http://www.swiftworld.net/2012/04/14/budget-korean-27-ips-monitor-information-and-comparison-of-the-different-brands-and-models/). Above ~$700 budget you begin to see the catleap monitors falling behind other IPS manufacturers and it may no longer be quite the value it seems. Also bear in mind that these are often a roulette game as they tend to have high variability and you've got a snowflakes chance in hell of utilizing the warranty/RMA'ing it. Intend to seriously research the pros and cons if this is something you're interested in doing. Thanks to zxrax and Trill4t2 for the suggestion to add this. 

**Stuck/Dead Pixels**

A stuck pixel is one that is, whereas dead pixels are unable to be fixed. To identify stuck pixels you can use [UDPixel](http://udpix.free.fr/) or similar software. UDPixel can also fix stuck pixels sometimes by making them flash different colors. If your new panel has a stuck pixel, do not try to fix it by using the rubbing method. You may damage your display and be unable to RMA it. If it has a dead pixel, RMA it ASAP.

I gave a short story with the pictures

Overall, Far Cry, Dirt 3, and Skyrim with HD textures and lighting on max or near-max settings, all at or damn-near 60fps. I know Crysis or BF3 would be a different story, but for everything I do with it, I couldn't really ask for more.

**Issues during build**

Other than my nooby ordering/build mistakes described in the album

**Future Add-ons**

Money permitting, but I think that giant floating block of heat sink in the middle of your tower is just uglier than hell, and being able to say you have a liquid-cooled computer sounds awesome lol. Of course, it could use a SSD for the OS and adobe programs (I'm a graphic designer), but I find boot times with 8 already really fast. Also want to fill those 2 empty ram slots, possibly go with a bigger power supply and crossfire a second 7870 in there if I decide the next generation of consoles just isn't for me. I may also try cutting out a custom window and throwing some rope LED's in the case, not sure yet.

**Notes:**

* Yes

* Processor is overclocked to a stable 4.5GHz @ 1.35v

* OS is loaded on my Samsung SSD. The OCZ SSD was my old OS drive on my previous rig - using that for a few games now. The VelociRaptor was also pulled from my previous rig

* My original case choice was a Thermaltake Level 10 GT - almost $300. However I love the Stryker

* I will probably get scrutiny for the PSU - However

* The PSU is overkill because I plan to get a 2nd 7970 Vapor-X 3GB to Crossfire. 

* Yes I know the colors in the case and on my desk don't match to any damn thing - I'm also somewhat colorblind so...*shrug*

* EDIT: It seems everyone's in an uproar about the stickers. I personally like them where they are. I'm proud of what I purchased and I want to show it off. I'm starting to think some of you won't sleep at night until I change this

**Some benchmarks:**

* Windows 8 Experience Index - 8.0

* 3DMark 2011 Score: P9743 (Graphics: 9862  Physics: 9851 Combined: 8806)

* Unigine Heaven Benchmark 4.0 | DX11 | Ultra Quality | Extreme Tessellation | 8x AA | FS @ 1920x1080: Score 750 @ 29.8fps

* BF3 typically runs at or close to 60fps up to 90fps on some maps - everything maxed out now

* Can run Skyrim on High Res. pack with 20+ mods at seemingly 60+fps

* Sleeping Dogs with High Res pack - 42-45 FPS solid

* Max Payne 3 on Max (lol) runs like butter and is eye candy/gun porn

* Metro 2033 on max

Haven't had time to try many other games yet, without even trying. It really does help to have a good monitor. 

Also the Razer is my first mechanical keyboard. People may scoff at the brand

All in all, those feels.

And to those wondering...what the hell's up with the name of my rig?

... And technically, ram, and CPU).  Had to do it twice, actually, the first motherboard was really warped (think, like, half an inch, but it was no surprise it didn't work).

For me, and technology of most forms was regarded poorly and often banned if it was recreational (no games, for example, I actually scheduled an hour with a therapist to sit down with my mother and convince her at 14 that Pokemon was alright in moderation, just to give you an idea).

While I have always been a gamer, partially because my own interests tend to be more library geek than technology geek, and partially because I just didn't KNOW anyone who did anything like that.

It is really daunting to have to try to approach an entire field where you don't even have a frame of reference to begin sorting the information you are receiving out into usable bits.  Being able to hold my old motherboard in my hands and physically go over it and make the connections I needed to was amazing for me.  It gave me enough of a reference that, and god that nearly gave me a heart attack).

In fact, I'm not stupid :p).

So, sneaking peeks only to be daunted by the front page full of words and facts and names that I didn't know and felt I couldn't realistically sort out.  I think, however, that it's time for me to make the next step, now that I finally can, and work on building a system on my own.

My mother happens to be in need of a lightweight pc, there are few greater gifts than those of knowledge).

Putting a build someone else assembled is one thing

I know that all of the parts I pick out need to be compatible.  I know I need to pick a part and build to that (eg

MSI R7950 Twin Frozr 3GD5/OC is no longer on pcpartpcicker for some reason. I got it for £250 with the AMD 3 FREE game offer. Since ive taken the photos i have bought a new LED LG HDMI 24"" SCREEN as this old one was having problems with the VGA-to-dvi adapter.

The only problem i have encountered is that my memory frequency is 1600MHz but my in my BIOS and in CPU-Z it reads as 1333MHz. any ideas?
Case Fans are on full blast constantly because they are all 3-pin. Which is kinda expected out of such a cheap case

Other than that it runs perfectly

MSI 7950 Twin Frozr is also insane. Smashes through farcry3

I have always had interest in doing this, I deserve it, right?  (That was rhetorical...haha)  I did all of the research while I was deployed, and slowly bought the parts while they were on sale during my deployment.  Whatever I hadn't bought yet, I purchased a week before I got home.  

The build was really not that hard at all, however.  I first did a desk boot, and that worked without any issues.  I then put everything in the case, got it all hooked up, pushed the power button, and NOTHING HAPPENED.  I was in a state of utter despair.  The motherboard has a light which indicates that power is applied to it, and that nothing is wrong.  I was thoroughly confused.  I took it all back out again, I could not figure out where.  I had an extra set of eyes look at it.  They discovered that on the back where the motherboard meets the I/O shield

Upset that I couldn't figure that out on my own, I noticed that my H80 wasn't running.  I quickly shut it off, afraid that I had fried my CPU.  I took it all out of the case again and tried a desk boot.  The H80 still wouldn't work.  I installed the stock CPU cooler once again, and it worked.  My H80 had broken somehow.  Well it has been replaced now, and everything is up and running beautifully.  

Overall, speakers, microphone, windowed side panel...everything.  I learned a TON by doing this, and I will definitely be doing it again in the future.  Thanks again for the assistance, and for checking out my build!  Comments, critiques

I tried an external build connecting just the CPU + Cooler

NONE of the fans are spinning the only sign of life is the lighted up red power button on the Z87 motherboard

As this is my first build I wasn't prepared for this

Edit: As far as I can tell the Power Supply fan isn't spinning either

Edit2: NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENED BUT EVERYTHING IS WORKING NOW!? I did a paper clip test and the PSU fan spun, THANKS TO EVERYONE FOR HELP AND SUGGESTIONS.

Also anybody who is thinking whether they should ''risk'' building a pc,,False,,t5_2rnve,1375371376.0,,True
1366635618.0,1cuzky,Todays builders - are you waiting for Haswell or buying Ivy right now?,Archijslv,182,29,317,Just wondering,t5_2rnve,True
1362572728.0,19rsot,Why aren't there more decent MicroATX sized cases?,just_blame_me,184,30,141,"There are plenty of decent MicroATX motherboards and you can install them in a normal ATX cases but it seems like that partly of defeats the purpose of going smaller.

There are just 18 MicroATX Mid Tower cases on Newegg. The 4th most expensive case listed is under $60 with a PSU

A lot of the Micro ATX cases on the market are cheap junk compared to some of the nicer ATX mid tower or full tower cases. I realize some people want $30 cases but IMO not all people wanting something smaller than a 20""x10""x20"" case want it to be cheap.

When I see builds like [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGIb0tws_e4&amp;t=6m0s) (youtube link) with a Titan

Mini-ITX cases are a bit cramped but at the other end of the spectrum you have people buying 50 lb cases with like 15 drive bays. MicroATX cases seem like a good middle ground.

It's a shame Corsair doesn't make a Micro version of the 600t. Instead of selling it for $60 with stock case fans ship it with AF series fans like [these](http://i.imgur.com/Jz3AUcH.jpg) and let people buy red

**TL;DR** WTB good quality MicroATX Mid Tower

**Edit**: I want to add that the big IDE ribbon cables are gone, most people use onboard LAN and audio chipsets instead of PCI sound/network cards so there is less demand for extra PCI slots but people mostly still buy/sell ATX cases even though microATX meets most existing needs (even SLI). Additionally, as [AntiZig](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/19rsot/why_arent_there_more_decent_microatx_sized_cases/c8qs4f2) points out below that smaller volume cases require less CMF (cubic feet per minute) of airflow to accomplish air changes so less airflow is needed for cooling and the fans rated at the same CMF would in theory be more effective in a smaller volume case. 

And thank you Chokladkakan and everyone else for some good suggestions. Builds like [this](http://i.imgur.com/NWj7HTN.jpg) Define Mini show that not everything smaller than ATX has to be in a shoe box.

I had no issues. the hardest part was not touching the boxes until everything arrived. I still ended up building it in my old case because the Casecomm took ages to arrive. As did my monitor because paypal decided to use echeque for some reason. The monitor is manufacturer refurbished and works like a charm - not a scratch. Came with warranty too. I saved £50. OCUK were really nice and price-matched most of the components I bought. They have really good customer service from my past experiences so I was really happy. 

Ive never experienced multitasking abilities such as this. It cuts through everything I throw at it like a hot knife through butter. Photoshop and After Effects take two seconds to open. On my old laptop it took about 30. It almost pre-empts my clicks it feels so fast. I installed Just Cause 3 to test the performance and its phenomenal. Ultra high on everything and its super smooth. Loading times are pretty much non-existent. Runs super quiet too - with the case fan being the loudest. Amazon sent me two coolers by mistake (or I paid for two by accident

The Casecomm has insane cable management considering it cost me £28+ delivery. Check out the pics. I was worried I would have issues with the cabling but the most I struggled with was stuffing it all behind the mobo and closing the back lid. 

I spent a little bit over budget (£700) but I didnt take a monitor into account back then. This will last me a good few years

Spent a few weeks researching and the best tip I can give is **MAKE SURE YOU KNOW YOUR NEEDS** so you dont go overspending on shit you dont actually need. Also, you are within your right to return it. This is why I went with reputable suppliers.

So now

* Some general trivia on AMD chipsets is needed in the motherboard section to mirror the Intel trivia

* Does the motherboard section need an explanation of power phases

* Going down to 4x throttles the GPU

* Should all the guide be voiced passively (i.e. ""one could"" instead of ""you could""

* The pictures come from a variety of review websites for the moment (not sure if that'll remain as is in the wiki version)

* Do you think that assuming that the build is for gaming for the guide

1355442513.0,14taiy,How do CPU coolers like the 212 plus and 212 evo work? I try to give an engineering explanation.,thedotamaster,173,23,42,"So I'm in my 4th year of mechanical engineering and we learn stuff like fluid mechanics and thermodynamics, I'd like to give an explanation from an undergraduate engineering perspective.

What caught my attention about these types of CPU coolers is the fact that it utilizes copper heat pipes as the means for transferring heat away from the CPU to the heat sink. Heat pipes are capable of heat transfer several times greater than compared to regular conduction heat transfer (heat transfer through the contact of two bodies). Heat pipes are hollow tubing that have been vacuumed of air and filled with a bit of water. The vacuumed environment creates a low pressure environment. This is important because it allows water to boil at a lower temperature, it does not exceed 100 deg C even though it's still being heated; the energy is absorbed in the phase change. 

The water close to the CPU boils and turns into a gas absorbing energy. This area close to the CPU has higher pressure due to the new gas phase and moves down the tubes to a lower pressure area (the heat sink part). The heat sink is kept cool due to forced convection (forced heat transfer caused by fluid motion) by the fan. The heat sink is capable of a lot of cooling because it's fins act to increase the surface area of which heat can be transferred away due to forced convection. When the steam gets to this area, when the water condenses it releases energy that was stored in the phase change. In a heat pipe, its not uncommon that the temperature at the opposite end of the heat source is actually greater than the heat source point. This energy transfer via absorbing extra energy in a phase change and then releasing it else where in another phase change is what causes this phenomenon and why it makes heat pipes so good at transferring energy compared to normal contact heat transfer.

Some notes about heat transfer. When talking about convection, and the higher the heat transfer rate. (The 212 heat sinks are huge!). Furthermore, the higher the air flow, the higher the heat transfer coefficient is, meaning increased heat transfer rates. When talking about cooling, all that matters is the rate and not the amount of heat that will be transferred. Copper has one the highest thermal conductivity meaning it disperses heat into its body the fastest compared to other elements on the planet. This is why the make such good heat transfer material.

I hope this explanation helped understand why these types of heat sinks may be so good at cooling.

I started planning this project about three years ago, or LEDs all over the place. I wanted something simple, quiet, no bigger than necessary, and with good cooling... and since I've been working with wood since I was about 5, the material of choice was obvious. Water cooling seemed the best way to keep everything cool and quiet. Construction started about a month and a half ago. I won't include too much text here, just pictures from various stages of construction. Someone unfortunately lost the memory card that had all the pictures between finishing the woodworking and this morning, sorry.

1350203333.0,11gcvn,"PSA: Corsair is starting to take a turn for the worse (customer service, RMA's, QC)",droid_does119,293,245

So far Corsair has rather consistently shown that it will not compensate damage caused by their products as well as steadily having poorer customer service vs about 1 year ago when they would reply almost instantly (within 1-2 business days)

some links: 
- H100 leaking and no word on replacement and Corsair's new compensation policy http://www.overclock.net/t/1300669/corsair-h100-leaked-onto-my-brand-new-graphics-card-and-motherboard/0_30

http://forum.corsair.com/v3/showthread.php?t=110264



I'm sure that people would've had positive experience with corsair (like me)

Corsairs new compensation policy is
-$150 for a GPU
-$100 for a motherboard
-I'm not sure what it is for RAM or a CPU

TLDR: Corsair is having QC issues with their H~ series line of AIO water coolers. Their CS is starting to lack compared to the year before and their now only compensating a **amount** per each component now if its damaged by their use of their products compared to when they used to compensate full cost. 

I think we should put some pressure onto Corsair to do something about this.

[Video of XBMC + Steam Big Picture very smooth integration](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpiuGChujYo)


[Pictures](http://imgur.com/a/pCMPl#0)

This was a strickly Buildapcsales build. I know there is no sense in having 2133 in a mobo that only takes 1333. haha

I was able to gather the pieces to this build fairly quickly over the period of about 2-3 weeks. I'll break down each part and where the cost came from. CPU/Motherboard combo at Microcenter took $50 off. Memory was a Newegg Shell Shocker deal that came with a $20 rebate. Video Card was during that MasterCard deal at Best Buy where if you spend $100 you could get an instant $50 off


This build went fairly smoothly. The only part that was a struggle was getting XBMC and Steam to work together. I kept having the problem of XBMC going into windowed mode and not being refocused when exiting out of Steam. I was able to solve this with a small script I found


I will admit. I do have two other coolers that I got for dirt cheap, my heart sank. The next 30 min was bending the pins back in to their original position. Whew I thought I got it :-D. I move over to my motherboard and noticed that during the water block removal some thermal paste had scraped off a bit and fell into the socket. FUCK ALMIGHTY, my heart sank again. next 10-20 minutes I spent cleaning off as much as I could. I reseated the processor and I could feel that the socked was thinking, WHOA WHOA WHOA!!! Your pins are not perfectly straight. They were straight enough so I pushed down some more and it snapped in. I then mounted the stock cooler and prayed as I pushed the power button. Everything turned on!! Checked the BIOS and everything looked good. Now this is my 9th build, I guess sometimes things just do not go smoothly haha. You might remember my [Game of Thrones](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1072qm/build_complete_the_wall_game_of_thrones_inspired/) build from last August. 


All in all everything works amazing. Thank you for reading!

Woo! so yeah, i was taking my time.

It went relatively smoothly. It turns out one of my ram sticks was bad however

As seen in the pictures

Anyways, works like a charm. my old computer (a 2008 macbook) just friggin crashed whenever i tried doing 3D in Photoshop so this is amazing. (Not to mention it runs Minecraft like nobody's business.)

So thanks BuildAPC! you guys are awesome! couldn't have done it without your help.  It was awesome and I learned a pant-load throughout the whole process. You won't see me with a pre-built computer any time soon.

As with all the other CPUs, it's quite a bit more complicated compatibility-wise.)

You can find the CPUs here:

Initial pricing right now is for Newegg, and several other places in just a few hours.

This is just the initial set - I hope to expand the server-part offering over the coming weeks.  Soon I plan to add ECC RAM, and possibly AMD Opteron CPUs.

I am so excited to finally finish my build

Anyways, 3770K, 8320, 8350, 3820, 3930K, and the Xeon 1230v2 as my CPU at one time. Also I was a click away from getting the GTX690 before I realized that I have turned into that power hungry zombie I turn into when I am building a computer.

I am so glad I went with the 3570K over the 1230v2 I was originally going to go with. Just so happens my 3570K is well put together and runs with a lower voltage than what I usually see.

Once again thanks to everyone that helped me with all my questions. This really is one of the best communities I have been apart of.

It's looking good. I should be able to get in to PC gaming again - that makes me happy.

On the downside, but if anyone else has/had the issue please tell me!

EDIT: Downgrading to stable drivers appears to have fixed this - we'll see!

It's a good computer and it looks very okay inside (I'm new to cable management

All stock clocks because I wanted minimum noise - the GPU gets loud under 99% load but otherwise it's quiet. 

GPU: 40c idle
CPU: 34c idle

All in all

ASRock's bios is good. I like being able to control the fans very easily.

**I hope it helps any of you trying to plan out their build**

Anyway, and I wanted to show it off after making some new updates.

Its been a long time in the making

Some of you might have seen me around /r/buildapc and I do my best to help people out. This has been a valuable tool which I use primarily to do that - post perfect cookie cutter builds at the different price points.

---

I recently expanded this to other countries (UK

Please note that these are **strictly gaming builds**. I fully intend to keep this updated with sales and updates with parts where possible and this would be made very difficult if I introduced other uses (though I may expand to them eventually)

Drag the slider to select a budget. Release and the site will fetch a build at that price point. You can also click the up and down buttons to each side of the slider to adjust in increments of 20.

You can toggle the inclusion of an optical drive and Windows by clicking the respective buttons.

You can get a link to the build on pcpartpicker or markup buttons to post to reddit or forums using their respective buttons too.

Simply copy the URL in the browser to easily share the build. It contains all the variables you have chosen.

Works in Chrome/Firefox/Safari/IE10 but sadly not older versions of IE as they don't support html5 replacestate which are required.

---

**Please post your feedback** - every single little piece helps me out, but Im sure some of the experts here can tear some holes in a fair few of them. As is the nature of something so volatile.

**New features** to add are always welcome

I understand that some of you may be suspicious of my site and whether it is good enough to rely on, bar personal preferences :)

**CPU/motherboard:** Pretty standard for this sub. I went Intel over AMD because I just valued single-threaded performance a little more. Runs circles around my old i3-550. Stable at 4.5 GHz right now.

**RAM:** I know, so I just went for it.

**SSD:** Literally the best purchase I have made. If you don't have one

**GPU:** Would have tried an AMD card this time around if this thing hadn't been so cheap ($180!). Performance is great

**Case:** I've been moving around a lot lately (will move again in August)

**5.25 Drawer:** Second best investment next to the SSD. I kid you not.

**Fans:** My CPU cooler fan's bearing was dying
