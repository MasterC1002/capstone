I'm Max Zagorac(fake name), but I got over that quick after taking over the starting point guard position. I quickly became one of the best passers in the game, finding Monta Ellis, David Lee, and Ekepe Udoh under the basket for quick plays. Curry obviously wasn't too happy about coming off the bench, but he was a valuable contributor to the team and won 6th Man of the Year. I won rookie of the year and we made the 4th seed, losing to the Clippers in a heartbreaking 7 games of the first round. They went on to win the conference

Now in my second year, but because of the Warriors' alphabetical order, we choose near the end. This happens every year, with the 76ers getting first pick every year, followed by Bobcats, Bucks, Bulls, only to lose in seven games/second round to OKC. All year long

Now in my 3rd season, OKC, in the Western Conference Finals. After another heated battle between our top two teams, OKC came out on top once again, besting us in 7 games. It was always 7 games. They went on to defeat the Indiana Pacers 4-1 and win once again. Obviously, my frustration with the team was at a boiling point.

Now in my 4th year, I declined and sought refuge in the market. I felt a sense of loyalty towards the team that drafted me and gave me a chance, but I wanted something new. I felt even worse after I found out Steph Curry left via free agency to the Detroit Pistons, leaving the Warriors a shell of themselves. Being from Los Angeles, UCLA graduate, and life-long Lakers fan, I naturally gravitated towards the listless Lakers. Despite having the likes of Baron Davis, Metta World Peace, making it a Zagorac/Bryant/Lawson/Gasol/Bynum lineup. Gasol was still recovering from a torn ACL a season ago, meeting a familiar foe. By this time

My 5th year in the NBA was to be one of records. Record breaking that is. I set the record for steals, and nearly points. I scored 80 points to almost beat Kobe's record but unfortunately, our coach (Patrick Ewing) took me out before I could make that last basket. We kept the team we had from last year and dealt with a few minor injuries. Other than our two big men, we had nobody bigger than 6'7"" which was a constant problem in the post. However, we still went on to have the best record in the conference. I won my second MVP award and again made it to the NBA Finals against Derrick Rose, Luol Deng, Joakim Noah and the young Chicago Bulls. Having the 1st round, they were eventually going to put up a competitive team. However

Now in my 6th year, knowing the Lakers would be taken care of because I was the best player in the league at that point. To my surprise, I was traded to the Denver Nuggets for Danilo Gallinari and a young C named Andre Semenko (72 Overall). I came to a Denver Nuggets team that seemed to be in rebuilding mode. They had just signed Marshon Brooks off free agency, had a 28 year old rookie named Justin Harper as their PF, Andre Blatche as their C, and Jordan Hamilton as their SF. They lost Lawson to free agency and traded away most of their assets, including Kenneth Faried. This was going to be a challenge. We went on to have a 14 game winning streak that took us to the top of the conference and before you know it, except this time, while a newly signed Landry Fields went to SF, so we have some young talent

The exception is the Prospect role

My suggestion is that age and your team record last year should also impact their decision. A 35 year old player that could be a starter should be OK with being a role player on a championship team.

Also

This usually means that my friends and I toggle off player roles. But I don't like that since I feel you shouldn't be able to fill your team with stars.

What do you think?

First quarter over, and always waited until 5 seconds until he threw up a terrible shot that always went in. At halftime, I was down by 5 still. He was just abusing Lebron and Westbrook. He kept going into replay mode to show his 'Amazing dunk' on one of my bronze players. I was getting a little fed up because he was outscoring me without any actual ability to play the game...
Last Quarter, last minute, down by 4! My possession, and I throw it into the paint with Petro standing right there, and he makes it a 2 point game! 31 seconds left as I foul Westbrook on the inbound. He amazingly misses the first. I'm ready to take this game home and tell everyone I just beat a douche with money! AND THEN HE MISSES THE SECOND! All I need is an open shot, any open shot.

Around your controlled player's feet is a circle. When taking a shot, the shot will be correctly timed. Be careful though; if you release the stick/button **exactly** as it flashes, the release will be too early. Your reaction time is accounted for with the flash, so you should be letting go *slightly* after.

I think it would be awesome

  I can't count how many times the game has asked my player to bring the team within 5 points, all you get is 100 more vc, and thats really it.
  What if it was made into a really cool spectacle. For example, and you begin to take a shot from behind the arc that could potentially give you the lead. Right after you release , a camera/graphic sequence occurs. Much like in MLB BIGS when you hit a homerun, it showed 4 different camera angles of your hit and added graphics and sound effects to make it effective. Then, as the balls sinks through the net, the game slows down for a second. It shows the crowd reaction, the players reaction

A variety of these moments would definitely add more to the experience. We are all so attached to our players already

This could also be used when you have a REALLY monster dunk. A slow down sequence where everyone is holding their breath. One can dream.

They have got to put in what I would call a **Discipline** factor. A **highly disciplined player tend to play the ball game like a professional** (the only reason people actually pay you to play basketball). They fight the ball game 110%, unconstructive hero ball, know their spot on the team, play good team defense, be a no-nonsense good professional like a FBI agent (semi-kidding).

Players like **Tim Duncan, KG, Manu Ginobili, Ray Allen, Jarrett Jack, Chauncey Billups** etc., should have a high discipline and they benefit the team performance and chemistry. Teams with mostly disciplined players (San Antonio, Denver) tend to play better and win more games.

(To put things into perspective

Players like **Javale McGee, Nate Robinson, Nick Young, Jordan Crawford, Brandon Jennings, and Allen Iversion** (AI diehard fans don't like this already), have low discipline and tend to be chemistry killers, do unconstructive things

They should include a Discipline factor to go along with other non-ability human factors like consistency and clutch. Without it

EDIT: HOW IT MANIFESTS IN GAME: Individually, **go for photogenic putback dunks** more than necessary and missing out on transition defense *cough mcgee cough*, **dribble for a fastbreak and make wild pass** without having a good Ball Handle *cough mcgee again cough*.

**Gerald Wallace, Nets - 6'7""**
He's more well known than some players on this list and is the closest thing to a superstar on this list but he's a good place to start as he has a little bit less publicity following him as opposed to some of the star swingmen in NBA 2k13. To put his effectiveness simply - he can drive like LeBron, he plays defense like a tall Tony Allen, and he has a decent shot, too. 

**Hamed Haddadi, Raptors - 7'3""!!!!**
To use the words of Stephen A. Smith - THIS GUY IS A BONAFIDE SCRUB! Why would I put him on this list? He's a 25 year old 7'3"" scrub. That means potential, but develop him and you've got yourself an unchained beast on your hands.

**Avery Bradley, Celtics - 6'2""**
This guy might not be as under the radar due to Rondo's injury, but he's young at only 22 years of age. Develop him offensively and you have a great starter at the combo guard spot. 

**Paul Millsap, Jazz - 6'10""**
He's the second oldest player on this list behind Gerald Wallace at 28 years of age, rebounder, ball handler (for a big man) and even a good passer. He could use some work on his defense, but other than that he's one of my favorite PF's to play with.

**Jeremy Evans SF/PF, 6'9""**
Athleticism. This guy won the dunk contest a year ago, passing, whatever. You could literally take this guy and make a Center, Power Forward, Small Forward, or even an Austin Daye-like SG. The possibilities are endless with him at the flex. Not only that, but he's already a great guy to run pick and roll with. For whatever reason this guy loves to cut to the basket and roll hard on the pick and roll. It might be in his player tendencies. You could easily cheese with this guy online already. I scored 20 with him last game in 5 minute quarters. He's that effective. 

**Jose Calderon, Raptors - 6'1""**
He's the best pick and roll PG by a mile to me. His shot form is silky, and he can finish at the rim. He's the 5th best pure PG in the game in my opinion. Start him or play him at sixth man and you've got a great core PG. 

**Danny Green, Spurs - 6'6""**
Danny Green gets no love. He's a great shooter

**Carl Landry, Warriors - 6'9""**
Now I might be biased here because he's a Purdue Boilermaker, he cuts to the basket well, and can finish shots in traffic. He's also very quick for a PF and can get in passing lanes for steals. At times I've even ran the floor after grabbing a rebound on defense with this guy. He's a great player to have on your team and he's extremely overlooked

**Chandler Parsons, 24 years old - 6'9""**
I say SF, gets putback dunks left and right, plays solid on ball D, is taller than most SGs and even SFs and grabs boards. Anything else you want from a flex player? I know I can't think of anything. Get this guy. 

**Reggie Evans, Nets - 6'9""**
Rebounding and hustle machine. Next. 

**Goran Dragic, Suns**
He can score

My overall rating is currently at a 73 and I'm just about to enter the playoffs in my first season. At this point I've basically put the Jazz in a backpack and carried them up this mountain to the playoffs on my own

I've seen quite a few threads just about everywhere complaining about the difficulty of the mode

Before I begin

* Yup, and won't get you the ball when they should. Get used to it.

* And guess what else? The opponent's AI is going to be wonky at times as well. They'll predict your shots and make wild looks with your hand in their face. Get used to it.

* The post-game interviews are retarded and always will be. I usually pick the 'B' option (which coincidentally is usually the most douche-sounding) but more often than not, etc.

Now that that's out of the way

* **

* **Racking up assists**

My go-to method for stacking the assists up as a PG is to **call isolation at the top of the key**. Pick a side and take your defender to the hoop. One of the defenders on either the right or left side will usually pull off their man to play help defense, pump fake and go for the layup. Using this method almost always guarantees me around ~5 assists per game.

* **

* **Attributes to pour points into**

Most of these should be obvious (all of your shooting attributes, shooting in traffic, pass, free throw is another great and inexpensive one) but there are a few that I've learned to ignore. For example, speed is almost useless. As a PG, I've also ignored dunk (which I don't see the point of spending points there until maybe after I've maxed everything else) as well as rebounding (which I was never good at anyway).

An easy drill to improve your shooting attributes fast is the vanilla shooting drill, Medium Shot, 3PT Shot, Offensive Awareness, or Offensive Clutch.

* **

* **Scoring**

First off, hold LB (at least for XBox 360) to call for a pick. Dribble off the screen, and if your defender gets behind you, you'll have either an open lane, or a defender will come to play help defense under the basket, giving you an opportunity to pass for an open look. If your defender fights through the screen or goes past it, pass to the screener for a usually easy assist.

When driving to the basket, then a hopstep (press right stick to the right or left after a dribble move), pump fake, and then I go up for the layup. Using this method it's easy to get defenders into the air and force fouls.

My Medium Shot is at a 92 at the moment, although I don't take many 3 point shots at all unless I've been left wide open or my defender is sagging off of me majorly.

* **

* **Defending**

Defending can be tough

Remember--don't be afraid to let the ballhandler take a 3. 10 times out of 10 I'd rather sag off the guy I'm guarding and let him take a 3 then play up in his face and get burned

* **

A few random tips...

* Don't be afraid to call for a post up play and feed it to your posts. Don't feel pressured as a PG to be creating EVERY ounce of offense--trust the guys down low.

* Don't constantly expect to make every single shot you take

* I like having my quarters set to 5 minutes rather than anything higher. Sure, but I play out every game (and I suggest you do, too) so it's much faster and easier to get through a season this way, as well as less frustrating.",,False,self,True,t3_qc00y

The conventional wisdom for stopping 3 point cheese is running a 3-2 zone defense.  Zone defense means your player is assigned a specific zone on the floor instead of an individual player.  3-2 refers to the fact that you'll have 3 players on the perimeter guarding shots and 2 players guarding the basket.  This front loads your defense and makes getting an open 3 much more difficult for your opponent.

While you're in the 3-2 zone you're also going to want to select the ""pressure shooters"" button.  This is going to cause your players to....you guessed it...pressure the shooters.  This makes a huge difference, and accept that he's going to blow by you for a dunk sometimes.  That's the price you pay.

Now, now what?  Who do you control?  That decision is completely situational, but for me, most times your best bet is the Power Forward.  Why?  Because the NBA actually has very few dominant PF's right now, especially PF's that can shoot 3's.  This is important because you're going to be playing primarily help defense to stop the 3 point shot.  Bottom line is you want to choose the player who's defensive assignment is the least threatening on offense (specifically 3 point offense) due to the fact that he's going to be largely unguarded because you'll be playing help defense.  The reason you generally don't choose your center is because you don't want it to be completely obvious that there are no big bodies in the paint, and he's more likely to be able to effectively guard 2 players for close range shots.  (this may not be true for every team, but for the Bulls Noah is a lot more intimidating/effective under the basket than Boozer)



So


Step 1:  Make him Cheese with someone else.
So, I double team by tapping left bumper.  This typically sends my guards to  double up on a cheeser, this method works especially well on point guard cheesers.  You want to double them right as they cross half court, forcing them to beat you with someone else.

Step 2:  Switching on Defense.

When you're running the double team, a likely candidate for cheese option #2.    Since cheesers generally only want to shoot 3's and fast break dunk, you really don't have to worry about the opposing PF, so you manually pull your PF to the perimeter and have him guard any open shooters at the 3 pt line.  Don't commit too much, but as soon as you see the ball being passed to the unguarded shooter pressure him hard.  If he runs around you that's fine, but do not let him taker a catch-and-shoot 3.

Now, they quit.

After that, keep doing it till they double him, and then find the open man and let get in a groove.  If you are posting up with Boozer, don't stop till they have everyone in the paint flailing around at you, if you see 3 guys on you in the paint, you have an open 3 somewhere.  And don't get in a pissing contest and start trying to answer 3 pointers.  These chuckers are the same kind of kids who learned one really cheap move in a fighting game and only use one character, and one move.  Effective?  Sure.  Unsportsmanlike and proof that you are only having fun if you're winning?  Definitely.  Make the smart play

Good luck

TLDR: 3-2 defense, double team that cheese, help defense, 45 second long replay every time he airballs.

&amp;nbsp; To me, I had Durant in mind). With the advent of Virtual Currency, these dreams were crushed.  This game went from what I expected to be one of my top 10 gaming experiences, to a money grubbing, poorly disguised rich kid VC store.

&amp;nbsp; Not only is MyTeam just a thinly veiled attempt to persuade us to buy VC

* &amp;nbsp;  **Private games**. The ability to play with your friends alone would make MyTeam *worlds* better. 
* &amp;nbsp;  **The rosters do not update over time.** For example, started the season at a 71 overall. Now, he is in the low 80’s. However, because the MyTeam ratings do not update, Lillard is still at a 71 in MyTeam. This kills the “living factor” of the game, in which how a player would play in real life dictates how he is in-game. The players’ performance affects only their price (which is already too high), and not their ratings.
* &amp;nbsp;  **Trading**. Although I could almost imagine how an argument could be made against trades, trading is a much-needed feature. Suppose my team is deep at the backcourt slots, with Stephen Curry, Rajon Rondo, James Harden, and Manu Ginobili. In a random stroke of luck, I come across Mitch Richmond in a Booster pack, I could trade one to a friend to help fill a position I’m lacking in (For example, compared to the current “Get matched up with 1 person at a time” mentality

&amp;nbsp;  Despite the lack of these basic features, the only viable option to attain multiple superstars: Buying VC. Not only do they make the players too expensive, but now 2k lets us know that 2k13 is nothing but a cash grab.  When your options are extreme amounts of playing time (with both MyCareer and MyTeam being the least efficient methods of gaining VC despite being the most hyped modes) and buying the currency, most people with the money to spare will choose to buy it. I find this despicable.

&amp;nbsp;  But it doesn’t stop at buying the players. No, and you’re playing at a net loss every game, requiring more and more VC just to play. With a perfect team, the cost to play a single game can be over x5 the reward. VC is a broken system which supports a broken mode.

Personally, making it even more awesome.

Also more signature things in general like fixing signature layup packages and whatnot. Imagine performing Steve Nash's finger roll in next gen atmosphere.. Or imagine them adding more layup packages for more prominent guys like LeBron (he has a few contact layups that are so successful because of his size and strength) or Steph Curry (does a lot of left handed floaters and such to score in the lane due to his lack of size). And so on.

Crew would also be nice.

What would probably make this game a deal breaker for me is if they focus nothing on improving gameplay and hinge entirely on getting purchases from casuals and others due to the fact that it's going to be next gen alone.

----

**Defensive**

1. Guard your player closely
2. Simply guard the man you're supposed to.
3. After taking your shot
4. Do *not* try to steal the ball as often - it'll likely just result in a foul.
5. When trying to rebound
6. Always guard the player you're supposed to be guarding. He'll run around on the court - don't lose track of him though
7. Refer to point #2 under 'Miscellaneous.'
8. -Adjust coach sliders that set fast break and defense pressure in the 90's. -Play a 3-2 zone, it gets the PG hot as well as the dunker -View all of your players skill sets, especially if they have signature skills, and exploit them -Use pick and rolls, especially with dunking centers. (via /u/PeterGriffin24)
9. Let your defense do their thing. Even if the CPU's offense is in the paint and is backing up for an otherwise ""easy 2"", allowing them an ""And 1"" opportunity.


**Offense**

1. Reconsider your shot selection. Don't take shots just because you can; instead
2. Spread the ball around. Try to give all your players an opportunity. If you keep to drive it in with your big man, drive it in and then kick it back to an open man for a 3-pointer when they lure their other defender in.
3. Pass the ball around carefully. Sometimes the CPU's defensive awareness can almost seem telepathic; a risky pass will often result in an interception
4. Shoot from all over the court. Give wide-open players the most opportunity. Try not to shoot in traffic unless you have to
5. Avoid as many turnovers as possible by making safe passes. Don't get cocky and try to do risky passes - just get the job done.
6. Call your own plays. Set play art to full. Call ""floppy"" plays for your 3 point shooters. There are all sorts of floppy plays. The common thread is that there is an off ball screen for your shooter which often ends up with your shooter getting a wide open look at a 3. (via /u/calamityphysics)

**Miscellaneous**

1. Use substitutes often. Bring players in from off the bench even if your starters' stamina/fatigue is only at 85 - you'll want to make sure you always have fresh players on the court.
2. Lower your ""crash offensive glass"" setting under your coaching profile. This will help prevent the opposing team going on a fast break.
3. The more aggressively you play
4. You also need to know who you're playing with and who you're playing against. Know their strengths and weaknesses, dunks, etc). At hall of fame you will need to know how to guard players like Kobe who will make nearly every shot if you don't play amazing defense. Also I disagree with substitute often. I would say develop a good rotation instead. i always have one go to guy who can do iso if their d is really good.

Myteam is a great mode

If unlike them you enjoy a challenge and want to become unstoppable at the game

Step 1. Learn how to coach.

Almost every coach in the game is set to help defense a lot. This is because in the NBA you can't switch sides fast enough with out the help defense recovering. In NBA2k13 you can... so you need help defense set to 25. You must manually do this every game.

Most players only offense is to run towards another defender

No help defense

Step 2: Set everyone to TIGHT defense in defensive settings on ball. Set everyone Deny Ball on off ball defense EXCEPT Korver/Dunleavy/Novak style 3 point shooters. Set them to tight.

Step 3: Only get players with good defensive ratings. Especially defensive awareness.

You can only control 1 of 5 players every time. You need good defenders to hold their own at all times on the other players.

Here is a list of good bronze defenders.

Tony Allen Thabo Sefalosha Raja Bell Brandon Rush Patty Mills

Step 4: Rebounding

You're going to force them to miss shots

Best Rebounders -

Reggie Evans Joel Prizbilla Anyone else with an A

Step 5: Pick a playbook

Learn your plays. Go into exibition pro and run your plays over and over until you understand them.

Start with calling Right Block with your point guard

Go into coach settings and turn on full play art and all the play functions. Auto plays you call

Run the play 20 times in a row. Learn how it moves. Learn how it reacts.

Then move to RB / A / B

Then run the auto play for several exibition games occationally calling your own plays. Work in a feel for when to do what.

When you run a real offense

Then go into real games against humans and do the same thing. Only if they run man.

If they run zone

2-3 - Shoot 3s with Brandon Rush / Raja Bell / Patty Mills 3-2 - Put 2 guys in the same zone, get used to do this and you can find open guys, and what I do is actually lay up over and over going straight...

It'll take time to learn the pace of this.

Then you move on to move advanced stuff. Know how to score on a 1 on 1 fast break with a bad player?

I can give you several answers... people who use good players would never know how because it's all too easy for them.

For you

Great stuff.

===============================================

Yes, the key having a storied career, the most important artifact that turns mere great players into legends.  Breezy thought he and the rest of the Hornets were poised to run through the playoffs last season, but naive complacency reared its hideous head.  The Oklahoma City Thunder, still graced by the likes of James ""Manbeard"" Harden, Russell ""Apparently still has a ton of potential"" Westbrook, and Kevin ""Doesn't give a fuck if you put a hand in his face while he's shooting"" Durant, ousting them from the playoffs in 6.  Breezy wasn't likely to forget the bitterness of this memory soon.  

===============================================

Entering the 2014-2015 season, winning 24 of their first 30 games.  A number one seed seemed imminent.

===============================================

Then, and didn't get back up.  A post game MRI revealed that Davis, the Hornets second-leading scorer and rebound-machine, had torn his MCL.  The diagnosis may have stated outright that the Hornets would be limping into the playoffs, dreams of a championship broken to pieces.  Monty Williams took to work that night, considering his options.  Could the team really be successful with Robin Lopez, who played the highly controversial ""full-retard-newborn-baby"" style of offense, it was impossible.  Carlos

===============================================

The Hornets did, and did, indeed, limp into the playoffs, capturing a three-seed.  They'd face the Steph ""doesn't understand the concept of missing a jumper"" Curry and his Warriors in the first round.  The Warriors, however, were an undersized team.  This left them vulnerable to Easy, and his sheer ability to go hard in the mufuggin' paint.  With an astonishing disparity in points in the paint

===============================================

Round 2: King James and the Phoenix Suns.  Phoenix's market operations last offseason, Lebron James, and Nikola ""flex your pecs"" Pekovic, proved fruitful, and they captured the second seed in the west.  The Suns' biggest concern proved true, however, and the Easy Breezy-Wes Johnson matchup unraveled the series.  After splitting in Phoenix, where the Hornets took care of business

===============================================

In the locker room after the game, but they lost Battier to free agency last off-season, and their bench is subpar.  Yes, if they could contain the Thunder's stars, their bench was surely better than OKC's, with Austin Rivers having just had a breakout season as the Hornets 6th man behind Jrue Holiday.  

Thinking it was one thing, and the team rallied behind their team.  OKC was running great offensive sets, getting their guys open shots, and knocking them down.  When they weren't running great sets, they were hitting their shots anyway.  The team looked unbeatable.  Before Breezy knew what happened, his Hornets were down in the series 0-2.  It was a terrible feeling to brood over on the flight back home, but the team turned it into motivation.  

In game 3, leading by less than 10 for the entirety of the second half.  Still, though, it was a win, and a win that they needed badly.  The Hornets were feeling good leaving the locker room that night, eager to get back on the court.  They held that feeling into the next game.  They came to game 4, and they conquered game 4, that New Orleans is a scary place to play for other teams.  The series was tied up

They brought that momentum all the way through the 3rd quarter in that game 5, and was not in any mood to drop this game at home.  Unfortunately for Durant and the Thunder, however, Easy Breezy was hungry.  Hungry for winning, hungry for hype, hungry for a championship, hungry for greatness.  Up 2 points with 45 seconds left on the clock, a full shot clock, Harden set up in front of him.  16, 10

===============================================

The Thunder were all but defeated, the Hornets were up 3, looking ready to move into the Finals for the first time in Breezy's career.  After running some clock, Jrue ran into some trouble.  ""Ball, ball!"" Breezy, cried, but James Harden was one step ahead of him, stealing it, shoot, and they dropped it.  The best opportunity to take a series against the league's best team was right in front of them

===============================================

Breezy went to bed restlessly that night

His fears were confirmed at the beginning of game 7.  Since the opening tip, more cohesive.  They simply wouldn't allow the Hornets to get themselves into it.  ""Calm down, there's a lot of basketball left to play,"" Coach Williams kept telling the team, but after every timeout things would only go worse.  With 10 seconds left in the 3rd quarter, Russ Westbrook drove past Jrue Holiday to slam home an emphatic basket, increasing the Thunder's lead to 15, it hit him.  Breezy was sick of being worried about losing, planted

===============================================

The 4th quarter was a grind.  It seemed as if the Thunder could sense the presence of the monster that had been born from Easy's mind, was  a monster in his own right.  Shot after shot went in from both teams, but where the Hornets were getting open looks around the basket and escaping double teams, the Thunder were settling for outside shots, and the Hornets slowly crawled back into it.  They were down only 1 with 38 seconds left, and the crowd was nervous for the first time that night.  

===============================================

Breezy was inbounded the ball, the lights, the sounds, the feelings of everything that was happening around him.  Jrue was to his left, the Boozeman around the paint: that was all he needed to know.  10 seconds left on the shotclock, and Boozer didn't need to be told that Easy wanted a screen.  Ghost step right, quick back to the left, smashing into it and falling to the ground.  Breezy cruised left

...and.....

SLAM.  

Silence.  The Hornets miraculously take the lead

But there were still 15 seconds left on the clock, and Harden received the ball.  Standing there, waiting, 8, 7, 6, whistle.  Good foul.  They'd inbound again, however, 2, puts it up

NO GOOD!

It's all over! The Hornets win! The HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORNETS win a dramatic game 7 in Oklahoma City

===============================================

On to the Finals for Breezy and the Hornets.  Having been so wrapped up in his own series, leading to a complete collapse by the Bulls, who dropped the series in 7.  Breezy had to laugh at the familiarity of that misfortune for the Bulls fans, and also about how now it seemed all but uncertain that he would be capturing his first championship against the Bobcats in this series.  Still, though, there was business to be done.


Wish him luck.

I started my career with a so so performance in the Rookie game and ended up on the Mavs. After a year of performing well, but that marks the great to Brooklyn. 

Right away, even being asked by the GM what player I feel we should bring to the team. Joking around and not caring, I recommend Anthony Davis. Turns out, we get him. Now we have a solid outside and inside team. We start performing and make a solid seed in the playoffs. I did key games through the playoffs and has sweeps all the way up to the Finals.

We go down 3-1 to the Thunder, mean game throughout. Not alot of fouls, just solid coverage and makes from both sides.  No team goes ahead by more than 5 and in the last 30 secs of the 4th, we are down by 4. I beefed up myplayer's 3 point shot and consistency for this moment. I go for a mid range shot and hit it. Then on the inbound I run up and tip it for a teammate to catch and he passes back to me behind the line and I drop it in. We go up by 1 with 12 seconds left. 

The game isn't over yet. The Thunder bring it down the court and are wanting the last second shot. They pass it around and back to Westbrook

1.  Multiplayer options.  There should be a 2v2 3v3 mode. I don't mean NBA jam style, if I want to team up with my friends I can play the computer (Which has it's own host of issues)  or I have to team up with strangers who are typically not great teammates.  In fact, in team up mode one of the most common tactics is to annoy your teammates so badly that they end up quitting leaving only your group of friends.  I see this all the time, calling time outs right as you  drive to the basket, refusing to pass to you ect.  Playing with your friends is more fun than playing with strangers, this is a pretty well established rule of multiplayer gaming.  This is a Sports game, it's all about competition

2.  This may not be an issue with everyone, one where you can use every player that is a memeber of a certain team, and another (ranked?) where current rosters were used to determine who is available to play with.

It's a video game.  I play to have fun.  Injuries aren't fun in real life

3.  Fatigue and substitutions in versus are out of control.  Fatigue should be scaled to quarter length, be exhausted from the extra effort.  If this game wants to be a basketball sim, then give people a deterrent from playing like cheap bastards.  There is a reason players don't play this way in the real NBA, it's just not feasible.

4.  Run speed

5.  There should be an incentive to use teams besides the Heat and Thunder.  Each team should have a rating, you should get more benefit than someone who uses the Heat to pound the Bucks.  It won't take much. A point system where you can buy Shoes/ old school jersies/  maybe even some sort of system where you can acrue points to spend on using A legendary player for a game.

I started this my career based on something I read from another /r/nba2k user. I wanted to make a point guard that would average as many assists as possible and keep my points under 15. But I didn't like the pass first style in creation so I chose athletic and then pass was the first thing I upgraded.

Rookie showcase: I did amazing. I ended up with 14 points

Trade: I requested a trade to the Atlanta hawks

I was unhappy with Horford because he was undersized and couldn't rebound well in the game due to his low vertical. I requested a trade and ended up receiving..... THE BOSHTRICH

My lineup.
Denzel Rustempasic (85)
Lou Williams (79)
Dantay Jones (74)
Josh Smith (87)
Chris Bosh (84)

Why is the players name different? Is you remember a post a little while ago about someone firing everyone on their suns roster and then auto signing players. That was me

Back to my player. I was really happy with Louie

Trade: dantay jones and josh smith

At first I cried I had lost Smith

Boy was I wrong! I loved lee! He could shoot just as well as smith, the only problem was his defense, lee was terrible as a defensive PF, I didn't care though. 

My lineup:
Denzel Diamotopolus (91) 
Lou Williams (80)
Harrison Barnes (76)
David Lee (85)
Chris Bosh (85)

Everyone on my team was going up! And we were the best offense in the NBA and I averaged 13.7 points

The playoffs! We went 57-25 and got the 2nd seed, I got 27 points 36 assists and 0 rebounds in that game. I was on fire, we won and it went to game seven, sadly in the end they were too much, starting

Dwayne Wade
Ray Allen
Lebron James
Larry Sanders
Al Horford

We couldn't handle them. But I vowed revenge. I was going to come back and beat them next year

Next season starts and all our ratings but 1 go up.
Lineup 
Denzel Diamotopolus (95)
Lou Williams (84)
Harrison Barnes (79)
David lee (82) he went down 
Chris bosh (84)

I didn't notice it until I found Elton Brand grabbing an O rebound

Then I heard commentators saying ""Triston Thompson already have 14,"" something I have never heard of.

And one time playing against Bradley Beal, seeing how mechanical and predictable these catch and shoot plays used to be in NBA2K, Beal retreated a bit back into the corner just so I can't reach him, and he got to catch the ball for an open shot, just like the way it is in professional basketball. Not once, not twice, he did this Ray-Allen, scorching me for 43 points. 

I haven't seen those unguardable leaning layups for a while, Duncan) are now much more potent and dangerous around the rim. More realistic I should say. There are a lot more but I can't describe actions in words, so you've got to try it yourself.

They didn't fix the invincible standing dunks though, dunk, and consistency ratings and the bulging 3pt shooting tendency even if they can't shoot.

Let it be known that I love 2K13. 

Some that I can think of off the top of my head:

* On Ball Steals. The system in place now is that if you press steal, but the AI would be smart enough to hide it away as they dribble, like in real life. I could be swinging away at the ball that is right in front of my player but it would either not poke it lose, or it would be a reach. 

* Dunking and Animations in general. This seems more difficult to fix. When 2k13 was about to be released, Josh Smith can just run straight at their whole team and enter his dunking animation, displacing all of the defenders, causing them to slide away to let him complete the animation. This applies to other animations as well, in that they displace their defender, making it seem like your defense had no effect. 

* Double Teams - Let's say that im currently being double-teamed. If i'm LeBron, I should do something."" 

* Sagging off of Shooters - All to often, but I really shouldnt have to.

* New Online Policies - I can only earn VC if im online. I can only have 3 total ""saves"" that earn me VC. I can have at max 3 different MyCareers that I can use on blacktop. You can buy VC for real money. MyTeam is so VC intensive that it is almost required that you have a lot of VC to do well/have fun,False,self,t5_2s84e,False,,,t3_1i7v0h

* Lower 3pt sliders. A LOT. The other day I shot 73% and lost to a team which shot 43%, Kobe, Delfino and Rashard are hard to defend. Also the current system seems to penalise those who play inside.

* Improve on-ball IQ. Related to the 3pt gimmick

* Create an auction block. Guaranteed

* Exhibition challenges with more VC rewards. Playing the Dream Team

* Reward underpowered teams. Bronze teams going up against LBJ, 15 for staying within 10 of a team with 3 gold players when you have none etc) to teams.

* Make teams/VC more sustainable. I understand 2K's whole intent is to make money - but look at EA's Ultimate Team model.

I have a stellar team in our online association

You know why this happens? It's not because I'm inept. I have no troubles when I play a human player. Yet when I play the computer;

*The AI decides when and where it scores, being DOUBLE TEAMED THE WHOLE GAME. And not just with the defensive setting on; I PERSONALLY double teamed him with Kevin Love anytime he touched the ball. It simply doesn't make sense; he inexplicably decided to shoot FIVE 3-pointers over double teams throughout the game, and lo and behold SWISHED ALL FUCKING FIVE. Pro difficulty my ass...those shots were rigged to go in. KD shot 86% that game. 

*The AI sabotages your defense to gain an advantage. Friendly AI players will run in bizarre

*The game is atrociously buggy. [Clipping issues will often render your defensive efforts completely useless.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrUCmRCOMyI) I've noted dozens of occasions where the AI will shoot a VERY well-contested 3-pointer, then the commentators describe a ""total lack of defensive effort"" on my part. I think if you angle your defensive player the wrong direction, or maybe if your block timing is just a hair off, the game completely eliminates your defender from the equation. So i.e. Durant can swish a 3 over a double team because the game does not register the defenders in his FUCKING FACE.

*The CPU defense is OMNIPOTENT. If I pass upcourt during a fast break, AI post defense is fucking impenetrable. [Another black guy knows what I'm talking about.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjNkuDi7QZc&amp;feature=related)

1341462724.0,w2a0y,Why 2k12 is broken and what needs fixed. ,BlackThunda,28,9,16,"**Gameplay issues that need to be fixed:**

* Directional passing with the A button never seems to go to the intended target

* Incorrect blocking/charging foul calls (restricted area doesn't exist.)

* Steal rating frequency (my point guard should be able to protect the ball without getting picked nonstop.)

* Reach foul tendency too low (your guy can get hugged without the refs calling anything.)

* Defensive Clutch is too good. (I'll be down by 1 with 20 seconds left

* Contact in the paint is just ****ed

* Slow closeouts on defense. (When contesting jumpshots

* my A.I. players on defense should NEVER jump on pump fakes. (maybe get raised up on their toes

* Turnaround jumper way too effective (almost automatic with any superstar

* The spin jumper (not the post move one)

* The bank shot control is poorly designed. 

* The up and under is way to good. (not the post move

* Spin dunk (needs to be removed entirely)

* Alley-oop frequency might be a little too high

* Dunk frequency/dunk in traffic needs to be toned down

* Free throw frequency too high (maybe make them 5-10% harder to make)

* Dribble moves need tightened up, not that slow step back animation. Hopstep needs to stay out, but damn, it's impossible to get any seperation anymore. 

* Make dunks more realistic

* The post up move when you press RT and push towards the middle and your guy stumbles into perfect position by some miracle every single time discarding the defender. (needs to be removed)

* Bigs are too fast

* When guards have an open lane to the basket

* Floater FG% seems a bit low

* Mid range % seems high

* 3pt % off the dribble is too high, lebron/melo, star players seem to rain them.

* Fouls should NOT be called on players ""Get fouled tendency"". it makes players too good, he would be drastically better than someone with a 0 tendency to get fouled, showing flaws in 2k's rating system. Maybe that should be factored into overall rating, but i could slash ALL game with the Cavs and shoot 5 free throws, Lebron can get to the rim 3 times and shoot 6.

* So many wonky canned animations, and shoot a floater fading left across their body... WHO SHOOTS LIKE THAT? and the stupid, dive for the ball and flip it back in bounds animation works like 1% of the time, the players move waaay to slow. 

* Shot stick/X button responsivness.... I've had dozens

**AI:**

* Spacing

* Defense assignments

* On the fast break

**Misc:**

* Why, defensive assignments, roations or camera angles?! changing this every game blows. you could save all these in 2k9! WHY TAKE IT OUT?!

* Ratings are so off in this game, 35% shooter from mid range? in 2k his mid range is like 90, he's automatic. Tyrus thomas has a 3pt shot, things like that.

* My crew games were the most fun part of 2k11, but you're probably strides away from that.

* Court size still seems small to me even though they've said they have improved it... everything just seems cluttered. May be due to the spacing issue.

* Let me play a season with friends! i dont know WHY you took this out

* Commentating could be a little more creative other than telling me the Cavs,,False,self,t5_2s84e,1341502565.0,,True

I'm a couple games over .500 and am barely going to back into the playoffs.  However I'm on a 7-game winning streak and my team chemistry is at %100.  Indianapolis is in chaos for the upcoming playoffs

Fastforward to gameday.  The first quarter is rough and I know I'm in trouble.  Even though Danny G is red-hot with 16 on 6-9 shooting the Milwaukee crowd is already getting rowdy and there are still 36 minutes of basketball left.  At least that's what I thought.  

The second and third quarters are a whirlwind of errant shots and broken ankles.  The Bucks are getting to the rim at will and I couldn't hit sheet metal with a magnet.  At least with anyone not named Granger

Fastforward again

Onto the extra period.  Again

At this point I'm sweating bullets and probably look like I'm having some sort of heart failure.  I've been yelling, basically looking like a 4 year old before bathtime.  The sixth and final period of basketball begins and I fight and claw to stay with the Bucks.  Granger is out of his mind with 57 in the game.  Up by three with 50 seconds left, the bad guys convert a three-point play.  I'm going ballistic and trying my hardest not to shut off the game.  I give the ball to the unconscious Granger, who calmly hits a three.  My hopes flicker, but deep down I know the sad truth.

I get a stop on the other end and stand near mid court with the ball in Danny's hands as the seconds tick away.  9...8...7...I start to dribble towards the right baseline and call for a screen.  It comes up

- No matter how low a person's rating is, just because of a defender is standing in the area, not even contesting the shot. I'd like to see a better rate of finishing layups.

- Flashy dunks in a half court setting is just ridiculous. When would you ever see someone drive the lane and do a 360 under the legs dunk? Keep it to the simple one handers

- Too many short passes flying over players heads. For example, but it soars over his head. There was no defending, no attempts to steal. Just went flying over.

1.  It uses your myplayer.  Using your created player is really fun.

2.  You can dictate what position you're assigned.  If you are doing a quick match team versus match, and I'm stuck with Andrew Bogut, and neither of us are able to really take advantage our our strengths/roles.
In Blacktop, and 3 slots.  It is determined by the order in which you join the party. (Host is PG/1)

3. It's a versus mode

I was pretty...apprehensive. Checking the ball after ever play seemed like it would really slow down the gameplay, it's really easy to lose hope.

But

1.  Lockdown Defender.  If you only have 1 signature skill, Shot creator, Spot-up ect.  Without even having to do anything you strip those weapons from his arsenal.

2.  Scrapper.  Defensive Stops and being able to recover loose balls is key in Blacktop.  When your team turns the defense on lockdown mode

3.  Anything that adds % not + skill points.  When you start winning games

Offensively, 3 point shots become TWICE as good as a regular basket, making them way more valuable than in a regular NBA game.  As with any basketball game a balanced attack relying on easy baskets and OPEN 3 point attempts is key.  Switch your strategy midway to keep the other team on their toes.  Been feeding it to the big man?  Switch it up and rain a few 3's on them.

This is probably way longer than it needed to be,  Micheal (sic)  Jordan Jr.,  and more Swag related names than you can shake a stick at.  It's a big part of the fun.

1355533796.0,14vfnh,From lottery team to champions: Orlando Magic,Crunketh,18,3,9,"Orlando Magic hired Crunketh as their GM after the Dwight howard saga. 

First franchise moves:

* Extended Vaugns contract
* Fired current trainer and hired an A trainer for faster recoveries


I did not want to have a losing team so i took a risk and made a bunch of moves. 

* Signed free agents Delonte West &amp; Kenyon Martin
I made a bunch of moves, &amp; Rasheed Wallace. Then traded Steve Novak, Hedo Turgolu, &amp; JJ Reddick and a 1st to houston for Chandler Parsons and a noob which gave me a bunch of cap space.

Eventually I had a great starting lineup with too much depth at the 4 &amp;  3 and started off 5-15. I was the laughing stock of the league

* **Jason Kidd(PG)**
* **Iggy**(SG)
* **Shawn Marion**(PF) Chandler Parsons (Prospect)
* Rasheed Wallace (6th)
* **Anderson Varajeo**(C)

Iggy became my star 1st option

We finished 4th in the East. We swept the 76ers in the first round and the Knicks upset the Heat in the first round. Knicks put up a tough match but we managed to beat them in 7. It was the Nets &amp; Magic in the ECF where the Nets just didn't stack up and fell short 4-1. 

Hoping the Lakers would make the finals so we could rub it in Dwight Howards face for leaving but they just didn't have it in them and lost 4-2 to the Thunder in the WCF.

Game 7 Thunder vs Magic and Rasheed Wallace goes 6/6 in 3 pointers in the 4th to seal the deal and the Magic are the 2013 NBA Champions. (Only game i played)

So I did a fantasy draft with the Magic where I could only draft 75 overall and under. 29 game season

Don't remember everyone I draft but a few I remember were Barnes, Birdman, Swaggie P, and Asik.

Later on I acquired Terrence Ross through a trade.

My team did horrible the first season (simmed the entire season).

Ended up with 7th pick in the draft and drafted McLemore.

Tanked the 2nd season and drafted Wiggins at 1st pick.

Someone traded me 7th pick for some prospect so I took it and traded the 7th pick for Isiah Thomas and a 1st round pick for next year.

Signed AK47 in Free Agency.

Current Roster:

PG: Nate Robinson (83)

SG: Klay Thompson (84)

SF: Andrew Wiggins (87)

PF: Harrison Barnes (83)

C: Andray Blatche (77)

This one is huge

**Easier Way to Simulate**

This one is a huge one. I often forget to check my roster, not what they recommend. Because a 65 overall player on my team was constantly at a 58 just because I wasn't giving him enough time, and I agreed with him that he needed more time. I think that would make things easier.

**More realistic Trades**

I don't like how I get a trade request every other day in this game. It's be better to look at if they were even reasonable

**Ability to change Jerseys/Court**

This one is a big one too. I know its possible, but itd be cool if it was included.

**More realistic Player Emotions**

Westbrook is just gonna leave Durant after 5+ years when his level was at 100? I don't think so. It'd also be cool to have people who stayed on the same team for a while follow that person. Like if Durant went to Sacramento

The trade I'm so far proud of is in MyCareer, I love playing with Anthony Davis.  I felt like we could definitely use more size though, so I recommended a few players to the GM, one of which was Roy Hibbert. So the trade went:

Pacers trade: Roy Hibbert
Hornets trade: Eric Gordon

Getting rid of Eric Gordon wasn't great

PG: Me
SG: Paul George
SF: Al-Farouq Aminu
PF: Anthony Davis
C: Roy Hibbert
with Ryan Anderson coming off the bench as a sixth man.

Honestly the team is pretty great.  It's difficult to take the ball into the paint against us with both Hibbert and Davis being able to send balls flying into the stands with ease

The ability to create plays in NBA2k hasn't been in any of the recent iterations, and such.   You could even do this during the game, I think the wiiU could offer something really cool and unique.  

Also, but one idea I had was that it could show an overhead few of the court, with icons representing the players on both teams.  The idea is that you could tell any player to set a screen, make a cut, or just to rotate somewhere.  You could accomplish this by simply selecting the players icon and then selecting where you want him to do the action.

What this brings to the table is more control over our team... often in 2k12, select their icon, and then move the left stick in the direction I want him to go. But this is often inaccurate and unreliable.  With the gamepad, we could tell them exactly where to cut.

There is anywhere from about 3 or 4 players to maybe 10-12 in each draft. I tried to include the players I figured most would want to see. The more recent ones are deeper and older fewer simply because its a bit of work.

The amount of time to play the 3 games has to be hashed out. It's unfair to ask people to do back to back to back games.

Any of the standard 30 teams can be chosen. If you want to run with the Miami Heat and only score with LeBron

You can also change teams in your 3 game series.

This is the ground work. More details can be hashed out depending on the interest in this thread.

(Edit for 3/18/13 @ 6:53pm EST)

*This is my first tournament organization attempt

I have two midterms this week

I am going to assume everyone who has already supplied me with a PSN is in. I will organize people alphabetically and then use a random number generator to determine the matchups. Once I contact you with the matchup time

After that 24 hours

The default quarter lengths will be 7 minutes and the default difficulty will be Hall of Fame. If you and your partner agree, that is what you must go with.

KEEP A CAMERA READY! I don't think people will try to cheat, but you must reply within 24 hours after the final day your last game can be played on. So for example, if I announce schedules on Thursday, you have Friday, Saturday and Sunday to play the games, and I need to know of the results before Tuesday.

Disconnections will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. If someone is down 10 in the 4th quarter and d/cs, but this is the ground work.

I'm also considering having the losers in the first round play each other for a chance to get into the tournament's second round. Just so everyone gets to play at least 4 games. I would delay the second round by a week to compensate for this.

If anyone wants to contribute anything to a money pot for the winner

I will hold final say on all matters. This is not a democracy! Of course I will listen to people's advice and opinions

That being said

Alright so the most recent league seems to have stagnated before the draft. There is currently 11 members in that league and no one has joined in the last few days so I think it is fair to assume that the interest in an online association on r/NBA2k is around 11 people.

I decided to make a new one because the consensus seems to be that HOF is too high of a skill level for a predominately CPU league

I think a league with 11 or so active users can be very fun

1320290738.0,lyjwb,This Game Isn't Fun ,slyguy183,15,2,11,"There was not a single game this year I was looking forward to playing more than NBA 2k12.  NBA 2k11 was the first game I ever played in the series and it was a revelation.  There was so much to do and so much fun to be had.  Making a playing who could barely hit a jump shot into a dunking

For what it's worth, the *game* is not fun to play against the computer.  There are way too many problems the erode the fun level.  I'll go ahead and list the most common ones.

- Computer hits 3's way too often and too easily.  Even scrubs can hit 3's that have no business hitting them.  

- My team's defense is terrible.  Sometimes I'm defending my SF and my teammate guarding the PG will just leave.  The PG hits a wide open 3 and I get penalized for letting my man score.  WTF.  This kind of defense happens way too often.  I wouldn't mind the computer hitting 50% of 3's if my team would bother to contest them better

- Driving in the game is insanely difficult.  Understandable given how last year was a dunkfest

- Getting offensive rebounds is nearly impossible.  Every computer will put a body on you somehow

- On the rare occasions I break free from my defender and head to the rim

- On the other hand, who somehow find themselves unable to block the shot.

I know there's more but this has gotten way too long already.  **TL;DR** the game has too many AI issues to be fun.",self,t5_2s84e,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/lyjwb/this_game_isnt_fun/

-Wizards are a 3rd seed playoff team. Wall avgs 20ppg/10apg

(Power Rant.),Jymtarr,23,10,58,"Did I miss the outrage in Early November when they shut off the servers for NBA2k12?  I'm having a really difficult time throwing money at a 60 dollar game that I get to play online for less than year.

I LOVE the gameplay for NBA2k.  I get the feeling that there are some basketball fanatics who put their heart and soul into designing this game. Guys  who wanted it to be fun and a true basketball simulation

And then there are the marketing people, their product, and their marketing.

""Executive produced by Jay Z""  turned out exactly as a predicted.  No gameplay enhancements, I don't know why anyone would have expected a different outcome.

The online options are awful.  People just want to play with their friends 2k sports.  Make it where you can do a season with a friend.  Make 2v2 and 3v3 lobbies.  These are simple

But, as I said is without equal, nothing else is even close.

So about a month ago, and popped in 2k12 after a month or so away from the game.  Servers down.  Oh well.  Then the next day, servers down.  I read online, they took the servers offline.

Who the fuck are these people at 2k and why do they hate me so much?  Were they trying to prove that it was physically possible for the 2k12 servers to be worse than they were when they were functioning and online?  Do they think it's a way to ""trick"" people into throwing more money at their re-hashed hip-hoppified version of last year's game?

I can't justify giving these people any more of my money.  Why?  So that they can yank the rug out from under me when they decide it's time for me to buy their next completely un-innovated product that is essentially the same game as 2k11 but now we have Jay Z and NEW PIXELATED SHOES!

The only reason I'm even considering paying money for this game is because my best friend lives across the country and we like to play basketball together.  2k shit all over that when they turned off our online play

SO fuck you 2k, I'm going to ditch you when something new and better comes along.  And I'm not touching any other 2k games.  But, what do you care?  You got your 60 bucks from me for 2k11, 2k12, and probably 2k13 go ahead and turn off your servers that never worked right in the first place.

1373470352.0,1i0gj3,This game is a disaster... [rant],ro50,27,16,16,"I've never owned a PS3 game that hard crashes my console more than this one. I have to do a [pretty ridiculous workaround](http://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/18edds/ps3_loading_custom_shoe_data_bug_rant/c9fkw9v) to even get the game to start correctly. But the latest thing to drive me nuts is getting all the accomplishments done for Hall of Fame in My Career mode. I'm in the third year of my career and have yet to make the all star team despite leading the league in assists, FT%, etc this is really annoying. Especially when I broke the single season NBA scoring record. 
I know everyone is so hyped for 2k14 and the next gen consoles but I'm at the point that I don't even want to deal with the frustration. I LOVE the NBA but until 2Ksports starts releasing a quality product and actually providing updates and bug fixes for it I think I'm done. It's a shame they are the only one licensed to make NBA games. 

**TL;DR** The bugs in this game are driving me to drink.

So we've got like **+24 million in cap space** in mycareer and I as a pg carry my Houston side to the finals (which has a poor back up 1 guard so I get too many minutes, also the team has a 52 ranked sf rookie and 75+ rated Chandler Parsons at the bench and the rookie plays more minutes than Parsons at WCF against Durant) in the second season. And with that 24 million cap space we sign **no players**, actually let go of our only poor pg backup and sign 2 rookies which are ranked less than 55.

I've played this career for two seasons and I've had enough. I thought if this is what 2k can do at the year 2013, difficulty levels have so much range inbetween them as in superstar is too easy and hall of fame is ridiculously and **unfairly** hard (at least for me), I **don't** want to see what they can do with 2k14.

Also ridiculous that a company gets no shit because it's 2k
