Step 4: Ship Beer

Step 5: DRINK BEER. (And post in the hauls thread

**What's Included**

There is a **minimum 72 oz requirement**. (1 6-pack of 12 oz bottles, or whatever combination you want to do to make it to at least 72oz. of beer.) You can ship more, but don't ship less. This is a public trade at the end and we will all know what you sent. Don't be a dick. Plain and simple.

Theme for this trade is seasonals! Specifically spring/summer seasonals as the weather is getting warmer. IPAs, general locals will work just fine as well as those more rare and sought after beers. Not much sense in getting a box of beer that you could just go buy off the shelf.

**Requirements**

You must have an account atleast **3 months old**

Pack Well! If a bottle breaks in transit - you are responsible to replace it if it means you're shippee is going to receive less than 72 oz. (Sidebar for shipping tips)

Send extras! Glassware, homebrew, &amp; whatnot are highly encouraged. (**DISCLAIMER** Homebrew does not qualify as part of the 72 oz requirement, it can only be included as a bonus)

Use Seekabrew.com to ensure the beer you're send is not found in your shippee's state! Don't send them something they could just pull off the shelf at the local liquor store. (Exception for ""rare"" beers that are hard to get)

I will send updates via email about deadlines as well as when the haul thread goes live.

Downvotes only serve to deter individuals. When I first started posting here I made all kinda of ISO that I didn't know were well out of my realm.

Hi all!

I've been involved with this community for a while now and I've been blown away by the generosity of many of the traders on here (big thanks to everyone I've traded with!).  In light of this, and the chain continues.  Anyway, I'm hoping that this could be some sort of a recurring event here and I'd like to take the first step to see if that's the case.

I visited Russian River last evening during the NFC championship game (condolences to Niner fans) and picked up **Pliny, and Damnation**.  Whoever ends up winning this LIF will receive these bottles.  Before you jump on this, I'd just like to lay down a few rules that hopefully won't cause a problem for most of you.

* If you win

* I can only ship to the contiguous United States.  Apologies to Alaskan

* You must have an active reddit account over 3 months old

Hope that didn't lose too many of you; here's how I'll be deciding who to ship to.  PM me a positive integer (1 or greater).  **Don't post your number as a reply to this post, 1, 2, 2, 4, 6, 6, the winner would be the person who sent me ""4"".  Easy enough

**TL/DR: PM me a positive integer to possibly win Russian River beer.** 

**Update:** Thanks to those who have PMed me their guesses!  I'm thinking that I'll leave this open until midnight (Pacific time) on January 26 so that people will have had 48 hours to participate.  I'll post the winner here at that time along with whatever information about the contest results anyone may be interested in.

**Update 2:** Alright everyone, chosen by **acrocanthosaurus**!  Congratulations to him, and I hope to see another one of these pop up sometime in the future.

In light of recent events, is primarily based on trust.  The following have been mentioned in the past, but are important for us to remember in order for our beer trading community to be sustainable and for traders to successfully complete trades worry-free.

1. **Don't be shy to ask for references from potential trading partners.** As opposed to other trading forums, you may message the moderators.  We will be more than happy to provide a list of former trading partners upon request.**

2. **If you are a new trader

3. **You are responsible for the package that you ship until the package is in the hands of your trading partner.**  If your package does not reach its destination safely

4. **If you encounter any problems in a trade

While I've been a subscriber here, feel free to post them in the comments**.  As always, you are welcome to message the moderators with any ideas as well.

Finally

Cheers

There is a ""fridge"" where you can upload the beers you have for trade. Your fridge can be browsed and trades can be offered.


There will also be a system that will automatically match your wish list with another persons fridge in the event you should both have something each other wants.
You can follow each other


There are a ton of other features that will be involved
Thanks for your time.


Edit: its a selfpost so I'd appreciate it if you upvoted for visibility, just want some feedback

edit 2: This will be completely unique to whats already available.  expressobeans and cellarhq along with BA and the other ""forums"" have the fight idea

Also, anytime a search is vague you run into problems, its just pointless.

Edit3:  downvoting my comments (oldstylecubsfan) that answer your questions with the correct answer is sort of immature

Let me answer this:  is it illegal?  No it's not.  If you can't understand it

Negotiations:  of course you can negotiate trades, pairing.  If they don't match in value, you negotiate.  

You'll also have access to ratings that show you value based on a number of things so you can make a smart trade if you're new to this.  Also trades can be private or public and you can leave them open for friends and followers to rate from good to bad.  


Edit4:  Just to touch base on what is already out there.  Most of what you see is forum based

Anything Forum based has the same inherent problem

CellarHQ: started with the right idea

The main question we really have to address is: Do we make it a mobile site with the regular site or do an app. 
When doing an app you have to hope people run updates (I rarely do)

1303938889.0,gyqav,Group Trade:  Beer of the Month Club #5 - Sign-Ups start today,SatansLH,31,2,35,"It’s that time again boys and girls.  My semester is coming to a close and I figure what better way to celebrate than to do a Beer oft Month Club.  If you're looking for your first trade to get your feet wet this is a great way to do it and to meet some of your fellow r/beertrade members. This isn't about trading white whales or super rarities; it's about trading good local beer with others. So if you're intimidated by the trades that you see happening and never have the stuff people are looking for that's ok. Our main goal here is to trade some craft beer local to you that you think is worth supporting. We don't care what it's BA rank is

**DISCLAIMER** Homebrew does not qualify as local craft beer but can be sent as extras and is encouraged.
There are over 1600 microbreweries across the country; you probably live near one that a lot of us never hear about. Those are the kinds of beers we trade here. We have people that cover all corners of the country and this will be your chance to trade with one of them at random.
How it Works
What happens in the BotM Club is essentially this:

•	Step 1: Sign-up for it by PMing me your essential information.

•	Step 2: I will randomize names according to region and I will assign you a partner to trade with. So everyone will be trading beer to a different part of the country.

•	Step 3: You'll talk to your partner about beer styles, breweries you've heard about in your partners neighborhood you hear are amazing. It's meant to open up a dialogue.

•	Step 4: Once you come to an understanding you trade shipping information and you're now obligated to ship by the date that I will set for everyone. It is usually 2 weeks after your partners are assigned.

•	Step 5: Receive beer. Post photographic evidence in the beer haul thread and inform me of your partners delivery. We do this so everyone can be held accountable and we can track reputation points for everyone who participated.

•	Step 6: Drink beer.

**What's involved**


We trade at least 72 oz. of beer (1 6-pack of 12 oz bottles, or whatever combination you want to do to make it to at least 72oz. of beer.)
Also when you commit you need to understand what is asked of you. You are expected to follow through and be accountable for the dates. If your beer is damaged or lost in the mail you will be expected to replace it. If you do not then you will not receive reputation and you will not be allowed to participate in future BotM events.
I will send email reminders about the dates but the goal is to have everyone receive their beer by the same time. Just because I set a deadline doesn't mean you have to wait until the last minute. If you and your partner trade information you can ship the very first day. I wholly encourage you to get it out earlier rather than later just in case there are complications with your shipping. 

**Theme**

This theme suggestion comes from familynight.  In honor of my semester coming to a close I think celebratory beers are in order.  This doesn’t mean white whales or beers you’ve been cellaring for 5 years.  More like when something awesome happens what beer comes home from the store that you want to celebrate with (as long as it isn't PBR)

**How to Sign-Up**

To qualify we are asking that everyone who signs up have an active account at least 3 months old. This time period can only be waved if you already have trade reputation on r/beertrade.
If you have read the above and are still on board

•	Your handle (yes I know that information is available when you send it to me but it just makes my life easier to copy and paste all this information.)

•	Your City and State (This is all I want

•	Your e-mail (So I can send mass email updates and reminders to everyone and so I don't have to rely on the Reddit Inbox)

Example:

SatansLH

Woodway

SatansLH@gmail.com 

**Note:** New Rule Something we are enforcing this time around to help protect members is the Ship First Rule. For those who do not have any trade reputation yet we are going to ask you to ship first. The moment your partner has a tracking number in hand he'll get the go ahead to ship from this end. This is to help protect our existing members from beer thieves and will also be used to protect you

**IMPORTANT DATES**

•	May 2nd

•	By May 4th

•	May 19th

That gives you 2 weekends to procure beer
Packing and Shipping Guidelines
Anything I can tell you about packing and shipping can be found under the [2] [Trading and Packaging Tips Section](http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/atztu/trading_and_packaging_tips/)
The only thing I'll reemphasize for the new people is to use FedEx or UPS.

**DO NOT USE THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE**

It is against the law to ship alcohol via USPS and can result in a fine if you are caught.

**Miscellaneous Info**

If you are not familiar with trading etiquette familiarize yourself with some of the reading material on the right side task bar. Extras are not required but once again are encouraged. It doesn't have to be more beer it can be freebies from breweries, candy, homebrew, if there's something local to your area that's not beer but would be cool to get send that along too if you wish. Any effort you make to go above and beyond for your partner is noted for future trades and makes it much more likely that they'll want to trade with you again. It's how friendships are made and trust is built out here.
If you're unsure of what to send

In person I gave him a Vuja De and some fresh Pliny. His end of the trade was some founders goodies and KBS once it released 2 weeks later.

We were in periodic contact via email before and after the KBS release He claimed shipping was delayed on his end due to some extenuating circumstances which I can understand at this point

So here we are a year from the original trade and I still have no box or tracking number. I'd let it go and chalk it up to table stakes for beer trading if he wasn't so involved in his local beer culture. It's not even a big trade I feel like this person just cant be bothered to care. If the package did ship I would at least have expected a tracking number somewhere along the line but I was never given one over the course of what must have been 20+ emails. 

I know this is a boring clusterfuck of a story but your advice is appreciated. 



tl;dr: Got fucked over by fronting beer in person to a popular beer blogger. Should I give out his blog and info?

Edit: Posted on r/beer too. I'm going to give him a chance to contact me and explain what happened/ship. I will follow up with his response. It was last left that I would be happy with ANY beer he shipped as long as I receive something from him. 

Edit 2: So I emailed him a recap of events as I saw them and asked him for an explanation. I told him I've given up on getting beer from him but if he convinces me this wasn't malicious I will drop it if not I will post his blog here.

1264111565.0,asktf,READ FIRST: r/beertrade rules.,LambTaco,25,1,6,"**Please read this primer in its entirety.**  

Some things may be repeated between sections because they are **that important.**

----

1.) **Wants/Gots**

* To get started in r/beertrade, just edit your entry on the page. 

2.) **Setting Up a Trade:**

* If you want to set up a beer trade
* Check the [Wants/Gots](http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/asxog/community_page_wantsgots/) section and PM an r/beertrade member with your trade proposal.
* Submit an In Search of Post
* Submit a For Trade post

3.) **Trade basics**

* NEVER trade beer for money.  That's called a sale
* Only trade with people who you are comfortable with.  If you don't feel like you trust someone
* We recommend not trading with any reddit members who have an unusual account history
* As much as possible, but that is a decision between the two people arranging the trade.
* You are responsible for the beer that you ship.  If the package is somehow lost or damaged before it reaches its destination

4.) **Finalizing a trade**

* Once a trade is ready to be formalized, etc.  Do NOT give your address, full name, or any other personal information out on the public forum.
* Don't forget to read about the [Reputation List](http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/blrjn/community_page_reputation_list/) so you can get reputation points for your trades. 

5.) **Shipping**

* If you're shipping domestically
* No matter how well you package your beer
* You are responsible for the beer that you ship.  If the package is somehow lost or damaged before it reaches its destination

6.) **What's allowed**

* Self posts ONLY.  
* FT and ISO posts.
* Instructional posts about packaging, etc.
* Questions about trading, etc.
* Linking to images WITHIN a self post is perfectly fine
* Trade summaries can be posted as comments to the monthly trades thread (eg ""March Trades"") that is linked in the side bar.

7.) **What's NOT allowed**

* No beer reviews or ""beer porn"" submissions will be tolerated.  You will be asked to delete them here.  Post those things to r/beer.
* Trade summaries should not be posted individually
* Please don't spam trade requests or offers.  Instead of posting a bunch of ""FT"" or ""ISO"" posts
* You will be asked to delete any submissions that are deemed to be spam or off-topic.
* Do not post your or anyone else's personal information.  Any such posts will be removed immediately and you may be banned.
* NEVER trade beer for money.  That's called a sale

----

*DISCLAIMER*:

*Neither the moderators of r/beertrade nor anyone affiliated with reddit.com are liable for or responsible for any damage to or loss of property, but ultimately you trade AT YOUR OWN RISK.*

1362649343.0,19u6il,The Beer Cellar: New Cellaring Site,CyberMonk6,55,31,61,"Hi there!

Funny that there have been a couple threads about new beer sites here recently, accessible at http://www.beercellar.me

I designed this site initially for my friends and me, I've tried to incorporate a number of enhancements and extra features.  On top of that, I plan to continue actively developing the site, and have a number of future ideas for new features, including features aimed specifically at trading communities like this one.

For now

* Tracking of entries in both your cellar and fridge (on the same records)
* Ability to quickly increment cellar counts on existing entries
* Quick tasting note additions whenever drinking a beer
* **Trading labels** may be appended to beer entries (FT
* Filter any cellar (yours or someone else's) based on cellar/fridge counts
* CSV Import and CSV Export of your cellar

For more info

Hopefully some of you guys will find the site useful!  My contact details are in the blog post, etc.  Also, while I can't promise when exactly any of these features will go live, here's some of the things I already have planned in terms of improvements:

* Add advanced search capabilities for trading purposes
* Add friends/favorite functionality to keep track of interesting cellars
* Along the same longs

Edit: if you'd like to see my cellar

**Edit 2:** thought I'd mention in case anyone is wondering that Trading Labels are not enabled by default

**Edit 3:** based on comments here and elsewhere

**Edit 4:** First (minor) feature update pushed live!  See my comment below,False,self,t5_2rgco,1362818758.0,,repLevel1,t3_19u6il

Everyone out here probably has a favorite local brewery that they doesn't get enough credit.  The purpose of this trade is to get the word out about your favorite local brewing establishment.  I will match people up based on location

* You must have at least one reported trade on r/beertrade or a reddit account that has been active for at least 3 months.

* You must send a minimum of 72 oz of beer.  This can be in any combination of bottle sizes.

* You must include at least four unique beers in your sampler.

Once these conditions are met

To sign up send me the following pieces of information to samplertrade@gmail.com :

* Reddit Username

* Location (state and city)

I will take sign ups until March 6

**Note: Ship First Rule.** To protect people from shady traders I am going to enforce this rule.  If you have no reputation on this site you must ship first.

Other information about trading taken from SatansLH group trade posts:

**Packing and Shipping Guidelines**

Anything I can tell you about packing and shipping can be found under the Trading and Packaging Tips Section The only thing I'll reemphasize for the new people is to use FedEx or UPS.

**DO NOT USE THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE**

It is against the law to ship alcohol via USPS and can result in a fine if you are caught.

**Miscellaneous Info**

If you are not familiar with trading etiquette familiarize yourself with some of the reading material on the right side task bar. Extras are not required but once again are encouraged. It doesn't have to be more beer it can be freebies from breweries, candy, homebrew, if there's something local to your area that's not beer but would be cool to get send that along too if you wish. Any effort you make to go above and beyond for your partner is noted for future trades and makes it much more likely that they'll want to trade with you again. It's how friendships are made and trust is built out here.

___The rules:___

You can submit up to 2 entries. Any format is fine

These 2 entries must be tan narwhals, pink narwhals… whatever… not normal stuff. 

Link for submissions:
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/17m81vV5Wl2elV4bOIgwz4MXx16UCOj5jywP0PyFEpIs/viewform

Qualified: Everything is fair game. Verticals and groups of beer can count as one entry.

Once the submissions are in

**YOU WILL ONLY SEND OUT YOUR BEERS IF YOU ARE RECEIVING SOMETHING YOU RANKED HIGHER**

And then people will ship.

The greatest thing about this BIF is that if you submit say… Blabaer. You will only have to ship it out if something you ranked higher than Blabaer is being shipped to you!

Submissions are open starting NOW until June 10th at MIDNIGHT

Shipping will be first week of July

You must be an experienced trader to participate.

Please don't comment on what you have entered until ranking is complete!

**UPDATES:**

6/5 - 30 submissions

6/6 - 66 submissions

6/9 - 86 submissions


**FINAL UPDATE:**

Ok

6/10 - 92 submissions

**FAQ:** 

""*I need to change my submission...*""
This is fine. All submissions are time stamped

""*Can you give me an example of a reasonable submission?*""
The quality of beer you put into a Beer It Forward is the quality of beer you should expect to get in return. Reasonable submissions include limited releases, barrel aged russian imperials and barleywines, verticals, sours, growler fills, etc... if you were going to have a good friend over for a beer tasting tomorrow what would you break out for them?

First of

For the Poker BIF, for the first tournament, I will be anteing a bottle of Boulevard's Bourbon Barrel Quad. Each person must let me know before the start of play what beer they will be anteing.

I have made a google doc with some basic information: the payout structure and the list of players. The payout structure should be fairly self-explanatory. The losers will ship to the winners according to their places and the number of players. If anyone has questions about this

The first game will be scheduled for Sunday

To register, click ""Join Club"", enter ""651112"" for the Club ID and ""1123581321"" for the invitation code. This will bring you to the club lobby where you will be able to join the tournament. (For all you who are worried, pokerstars offers free play [and only free play for Americans] so there is no need for credit cards or personal information.)

I think that just about covers it. We'll be playing poker for beer. If anyone has questions, this is a first draft so if you have any recommendations, they will be seriously considered. I will also make a reminder post for our first game a few days before it actually happens.

Edit 1: I am going to instate a two completed trade minimum for each contestant.  This is to prevent someone from creating multiple accounts / playing with no intention of shipping / etc.  I think a two trade limit is enough to keep spammers and cheats out but not so high as to prevent well-intentioned players from playing.

1283984433.0,dbbd0,Group Trade:  Beer of the Month Club -9/10,SatansLH,23,4,93,"**Beer of the Month Club - SIGN UP IS NOW CLOSED**

This is a simple concept I’d like to start on r/beertrade and hopefully do on a monthly basis.  Essentially it will be a monthly secret Santa where everyone throws their name in the hat, and we all get beer around the same time.  

Every month we’ll add a theme to the trade: beer styles, all suggestions are welcome.  The only constant is that it is local to you.  The trick here is we’ll assign regions so when names are picked we will choose from 4 or 5 different hats and hopefully get new beer to everyone.   
This is meant to be an introductory way for a larger group to participate.  So if you’ve been sitting on the fence or have no idea how to get started this is for you.  

**TRADING DETAILS**
When you get assigned a name this will be your partner.  I felt like people would be uncomfortable with me collecting a bunch of names and addresses to sort myself. So it is your responsibility to trade addresses and all other information needed to ship beer.  For simplicity sake you and your partner are going to trade beer with each other.  So instead of the traditional anonymous receiving that goes with secret santa

**DISCLAIMER**
[Click here for rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/asktf/read_first_rbeertrade_rules/)
Also those who wish to participate must have an account 3+ months old and be within the continental 48 states

**SHIPPING**
[For advice on shipping click here](http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/atztu/trading_and_packaging_tips/)

**HOW TO PARTICIPATE**
Your account must be at least 3 months old.  If you pass then you can send a message to me in this format:

USER NAME
CITY
Suggestion for next month’s group trade 

This needs to be sent to me by September 18th.  For this first trade I will cut off at 30 people since we’re still in beta.  If we manage to max out then I’ll raise the bar next month and we’ll figure out how to accommodate more people.  When you receive your package send me a confirmation message so we can update the good trader list and keep track of who failed.


**DATES:**

* 9/9/2010 is the cut off for entry
* 9/10/2010 you will be assigned your partner
* 9/25/2010 this is the date you must ship by

** TRADE THEME**

This one is open to anything this time around.  Send whatever you want as long as it’s local and a 6-pack.  Get to know your fellow beeritor and come to an arrangement their favorite beer style, something homemade, or something your area is known for.  People like surprises almost as much as they like getting beer.  

questions/comments/suggestions/are welcome.  

If you experience any problems during the trade send a [message to the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23beertrade) and they will do all that is in their power to help make it right.

*(The following is quoted from the last BA forum link above and was written by BA user RedwoodGeorge)*  
**Packing advice**

Think about the physics of the situation - what can break a beer bottle? If you do everything reasonable to protect against situations that can break a bottle

Two major threats: 

1) Something outside the box. What if the box gets dropped, your bottle isn't protected. A layer of peanuts is good but make sure the bottle can't 'swim' through the peanuts to the cardboard wall. Rigid foam, cushion foam or heavy bubblewrap are all good solutions that the bottle can't swim through. 

2) Something inside the box. Would you put a beer bottle in a box full of hammers? Of course not. And yet you'd but a beer bottle in a box full of other beer bottles! Try smashing two bottles together and tell me one of them won't lose that contest. You've got to protect the bottles from crashing into each other. The first approach: more padding

a) pack the box -tight- with peanuts in between the bottles so the 
bottles can't 'swim' and hit each other. Remember the box will 
spend a week in the back of a truck so there will be lots of 
jostling during that time... 

b) put the bottles into individual cells
they can't leave their confinement they can't come in contact with 
other bottles. Make sure the walls of the cells are adequately 
strong to restrain the bottles if the box is dropped. 

c) bind the bottles together. This may seem counterintuitive but 
physics doesn't lie. Take the bubblewrapped bottles and tightly 
tape 'em together. That way they all move as a group instead of 
moving in different directions (sometimes towards each other) 

Now that you've got the inside of the box well protected

How about used cardboard boxes? I generally avoid them. With all the time, soft box doesn't make sense. If it's in good shape then fine but don't cheap out at the wrong time... 

Lastly, some line the entire box with a hefty bag. Either way if a bottle leaks the beer will stay inside the box rather than soaking through both and a) tipping off the driver that you're shipping a prohibited substance and b) weakening the cardboard of the box. It's not a bad idea to put some newspaper or paper towel in the box to soak up any liquid - it's much easier to contain a wet paper towel than many ounces of escaped beer. 

Expect them (aka 'UPS') to drop your box. If you're not comfortable dropping your box (repeatedly) from chest height onto a concrete floor then you haven't packed well enough. If you hear -any- rattle when you shake that box like a five year old trying to get the last nickel out of a piggy bank

Just keep thinking ""plan for the worst"" and remember that they (aka 'UPS') don't care about your package nearly as much as you do - pack with that understanding and your beer will arrive safe and sound.

FedEx users/receivers: Has anybody ever been visited by a ""Senior Security Specialist"" from ""Corporate Security (Western) Region"" ?

Since I was at work my brother played dumb about what kind of packages I receive and how often. After a while the man moved to questions about how the packages were delivered: does the driver knock


So I guess my question is - has this happened to anybody before? Did anything else happen afterward? Is this something to worry about? Are they on to my beer shipments? What happens if they begin to inspect my packages? Am I being paranoid? Any input would be nice.

For those who aren't familiar with this here are the [rules and guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/dorv9/beer_of_the_month_club_october/) from October's group trade. 

**NOTE** Reddit Accounts must be at least 3 months old to participate.  This is to avoid scammers and beer thieves and to ensure everyone has a Merry Christmas.

**Trade Theme**

Hey guys, porters, and winter warmers.  We will trade the usual amount of 72oz. of beer( 6-pack) but this time around as part of the Christmas spirit I thought it would be cool to trade an extra beer related gift.  It could be a hat, glassware, things that aren't generally freebies, etc.  If these things aren't readily accessible to you, I think you're all creative enough to come up with something special for your partner.  Gifts should be in the $5-10 range.  


**How to Sign-Up**

I'm going to do things a little differently this time to make things easier on me.  I'm going to operate partly through traditional email this time around so that I can send mass messages

* reddit name

* City and State

* E-mail


After you've done so post in this thread to let your fellow traders know who's in.

I'm going to set the cut off for sign-ups at 50 people once again.  If this gets an overwhelming response I'll consider amending it but so far we haven't exceeded it. 


**Important Dates**

* Sign-ups will be from **11/25-11/28**

* Partners will be assigned **11/29-11/30**

* Shipping by **12/15** which allows a little over 2 weeks to buy

**If you have any questions

**SIGN-UPS ARE OFFICIALLY OVER.  We have 26 people signed up.  Bare with me because today is going to be hellish for me.  This is my crunch week so I will hopefully get to it this evening but only after I finish a 5 page paper and a marketing project.  You know how it goes

Here is the list of participants in the event you are worried you didn't make the cut:

* Familynight

* SatansLH

* jtablerd

* xochihuehuetl

* soulfrequencies

* myheadhurtsalot

* Soonami

* Justn

Welcome to the 2013-2014 edition of /r/beertrade fantasy football!  We had a great group of beer traders compete last year and it's time to do it again.  Read through the following league details

Here are the details that I have so far:

* Preference for league membership will be given to traders with experience on /r/beertrade .  If you don't have /r/beertrade rep but have trading experience on other sites

* Every trader who participates in the league will ship a box.   I will be providing a list of all participants to the beer mods and it will be like a normal beer trade - you will get a trade rep point for shipping your box and will receive the usual penalties for not shipping.

* The prize distribution will be determined by the number of participants.  It usually works out something like: 1st place gets 4 boxes

* We tried fleaflicker last year but I know there were a few kinks on there

* I will tentatively set the draft date for **Sunday

* League settings will be relatively standard (1 QB, 1 TE, 1 RB/WR/TE, DST, K).  Scoring will be standard ESPN as well (except I will be taking out all yardage bonuses - e.g. bonus for a long touchdown pass)

That's all that I have off the top of my head

Cheers!

**edit for info I forgot:**

Last year's minimum was $30-40 of beer per person

**edit 2**

I will be updating this post with people who are in the league as I get through them.  If you don't have a few trades done on reddit

If you have ever seen “Survivor”, and players will be eliminated one-by-one until there is a lone survivor remaining.  Immunity challenges will be held at scheduled dates.  The winner(s) of the challenges will be immune to elimination for that round.  Players then vote for the person they would like to eliminate.  The player with the most votes is eliminated from the game.

Hope we haven't lost anyone yet.  Here are some more specific details.  We'll start with 16 players, while the other tribe must vote one of their members out of the game.  When we're down to 10 total players, we'll merge tribes and all immunity challenges will become individual challenges, meaning that only one person will win immunity after each challenge.  Players eliminated in challenges #8-14 will form the Tribal Council, and will ultimately help decide the winner of the Survivor BIF.

Still with me?  Great!  If you're interested in participating, and we want to make sure that all players will be able to fully participate.

Once logged in the main page will have a news feed of updates from users you follow

When you click on a beer a pop up screen of the beer and all its information will come up.

Pretty simple idea

When you sign up for the BIF you put one (or 2) well respected

Ie. I could sign up with Jackie O's (because I go often and have relatively easy access) or Upland because I have a lot in my cellar.

In your submission you indicate whether you're willing to make a box based on ONE of the breweries you submit or TWO separate boxes

Once I have enough signups (lets cap this at 20 for the first round)

Then, and on down the list. Each time, the highest ranking out of the 5 rankings that I can assign, I will.

After all the assignments are made


Then

Minimum retail value: $100 

Minimum # of different beers: 6 

Maximum # of growlers: 2 (unless it is discussed with me ahead of time) 

*at least 2 must be specialty beers (ie. something not easily available, brewery release bottles, etc) 

Minimum swag: 1 piece of glasswear, bottle openers, etc are fine)
 

The shipping window for this BIF will be fairly wide to allow people ample time to build boxes and visit the brewery they are representing.

1297384711.0,fj4nw,Group Trade: Beer of the Month Club #4 - St. Patricks Day,SatansLH,16,0,26,"Well St. Patricks day is coming up and I thought it was time to get this show rollin' again.  I know we've had an extra long hiatus but I expected everyone appreciated a little more recovery time after the holidays.  So I'm starting this one about a week early so we can get everyone beer before our favorite drinking holiday.  

In the past week or so I've seen our ranks swell as we crossed the 900 mark so for all you new guys, we only care that it's craft beer and that it's local to you.  **DISCLAIMER** Homebrew does not qualify as local craft beer but can be sent as extras and is encouraged.

There are close to 1600 microbreweries across the country

**How it Works**

What happens in the BotM Club is essentially this:

* step 1: Sign-up for it by PMing me your essential information.

* step 2: I will randomize names according to region and I will assign you a partner to trade with.  So everyone will be trading beer to a different part of the country.

* step 3: You'll talk to your partner about beer styles, breweries you've heard about in your partners neighborhood you hear are amazing.  It's meant to open up a dialogue.  

* step 4: Once you come to an understanding you trade shipping information and you're now obligated to ship by the date that I will set for everyone.  It is usually 2 weeks after your partners are assigned.

* step 5: Receive beer. Post photographic evidence in the beer haul thread and inform me of your partners delivery. We do this so everyone can be held accountable and we can track reputation points for everyone who participated.

* step 6: Drink beer.

As you can see it's a pretty simple concept but people enjoy it enough that I'm doing it for a 4th time.

**What's involved**

We trade at least 72 oz. of beer(1 6-pack of 12 oz bottles, or whatever combination you want to do to make it to 72oz. of beer.)  

Also when you commit you need to understand what is asked of you.  You are expected to follow through and be accountable for the dates.  If your beer is damaged or lost in the mail you will be expected to replace it.  If you do not then you will not receive reputation and you will not be allowed to participate in future BotM events.  

I will send email reminders about the dates but the goal is to have everyone receive their beer by the same time.  Just because I set a deadline doesn't mean you have to wait until the last minute.  If you and your partner trade information you can ship the very first day.  I wholly encourage you to get it out earlier rather than later just in case there are complications with your shipping.  We want everyone in the group to have a happy St. Patricks day.   

**Theme**  

I'm leaving this one open to interpretation.  If you want to send your partner drinkin' stouts and red ales you are welcome to do so or the makings of a fantastic black and tan then by all means.  I'm just trying to make it easier for everybody.  The most important thing is to check with your partner and see what kind of beer styles they'll drink.  Who wants to get a box full of IPAs if you can't stand hops?  

**How to Sign-Up**

To qualify we are asking that everyone who signs up has an active account at least 3 months old.  This time period can only be waved if you already have trade reputation on r/beertrade.

If you have read the above and are still on board

* **Your handle** (yes I know that information is available when you send it to me but it just makes my life easier to copy and paste all this information.)

* **Your City and State** (This is all I want

* **Your e-mail**  (So I can send mass email updates and reminders to everyone and so I don't have to rely on the Reddit Inbox)

Example:  

SatansLH

Woodway

SatansLH@gmail.com (spam email for anyone who cares)

**Note: New Rule**  Something we are enforcing this time around to help protect members is the **Ship First Rule**.  For those who do not have any trade reputation yet we are going to ask you to ship first.  The moment your partner has a tracking number in hand he'll get the go ahead to ship from this end.  This is to help protect our existing members from beer thieves and will also be used to protect you as I will do my best to assign you with an experienced trader.  If you and your partner both have trade reputation then fire at will.  I will inform you upon partner assignments of you or your partners probationary status.  

**IMPORTANT DATES**

* **February 15th

* **by February 18th

* **March 7th

That gives you 3 weekends to procure beer

**Packing and Shipping Guidelines**

Anything I can tell you about packing and shipping can be found under the [Trading and Packaging Tips Section](http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/atztu/trading_and_packaging_tips/)

The only thing I'll reemphasize for the new people is to use FedEx or UPS. 

 **DO NOT USE THE  UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE** 

It is against the law to ship alcohol via USPS and can result in a fine if you are caught.  

**Miscellaneous Info**

If you are not familiar with trading etiquette familiarize yourself with some of the reading material on the right side task bar.  Extras are not required but once again are encouraged.  It doesn't have to be more beer it can be freebies from breweries, candy, homebrew, if there's something local to your area that's not beer but would be cool to get send that along too if you wish.  Any effort you make to go above and beyond for your partner is noted for future trades and makes it much more likely that they'll want to trade with you again.  It's how friendships are made and trust is built out here.

1285993175.0,dlsjc,Box-in-box packing,LambTaco,21,4,11,"I thought it might help some of you out there to see a photographic tutorial of box-in-box packing.  I took some photos of the packing process of my recent BotM trade.

My philosophy is to err on the side of caution.  I take maybe an hour to pack my shipments on average, many times, with the outer box being replaced periodically.

Here's the step-by-step of me packaging a 6 pack + 1 extra:

Materials:  
One inner box  
One larger
One small box
Bubble wrap  
All natural packing peanuts
Tape  

1. Find a suitable inner-box to contain your bottles + some padding.  For this trade I settled on [a box from a Goose Island 12 pack](http://i.imgur.com/oWFAS.jpg)

2. [Wrap each of the bottles](http://i.imgur.com/L0bp0.jpg) once or twice around with small bubble wrap and secure with tape.

3. Figure out how you want to [position your bottles](http://i.imgur.com/Owov1.jpg) in the box.

4. From the small cardboard box

5. From the small cardboard box
&gt; To make an X separator

6. At this point the bottles should be extremely snug from the tight-fitting cardboard separators.  If you shake the box

7.  If there is any ""head room"" at the top of the box

8. Now you can seal up the inner box.  After the box is taped shut

9.  Now you can move on to the outer box.  While the inner box is designed to prevent internal collision

10. Pack a tight [1-2 inch layer of packing peanuts](http://i.imgur.com/Y0knv.jpg) on the bottom of the outer box.

11. Center the inner box on top of that layer and [tightly pack more peanuts around all four sides of it](http://i.imgur.com/5zgXG.jpg) until you reach the top of the inner box.  At this point make sure you've packed as much as you can around the sides.

12.  [Finish filling the outer box](http://i.imgur.com/j3qGM.jpg) with packing peanuts in as tightly as you can while still being able to close the flaps without bulging.

13. Seal the outer box well with packing tape.  I suggest using the common ""H"" taping procedure at a minimum.  I usually add more tape on top of that.  

14. Give your box a nice

**The Run Down**
This is the second month that I’ve done this for r/beertrade. 
To those new to the concept this is a group trade that operates very much like a secret santa...only with beer.  Every month we’ll add a theme to the trade: beer styles, all suggestions are welcome. The only constant is that it is local to you. The trick here is we’ll assign regions so when names are picked we will choose from 6 different hats.  This is meant to be an introductory way for a larger group to participate. So if you’ve been sitting on the fence or have no idea how to get started this is for you.

**TRADING DETAILS**
 When you get assigned a name this will be your partner. I felt like people would be uncomfortable with me collecting a bunch of names and addresses to sort myself. So it is your responsibility to trade addresses and all other information needed to ship beer. For simplicity sake you and your partner are going to trade beer with each other. So instead of the traditional anonymous receiving that goes with secret santa

**DISCLAIMER**
  [Click here for rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/asktf/read_first_rbeertrade_rules/) - Also those who wish to participate must have an account 3+ months old and be within the continental 48 states

**SHIPPING** For advice on shipping [click here](http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/atztu/trading_and_packaging_tips/)

**HOW TO PARTICIPATE** Your account must be at least 3 months old. If you pass then you can send a message to me in this format:

* USER NAME
* CITY
* Suggestion for next month’s group trade

This needs to be sent to me by October 11th if we have not filled up by then. For this trade I will cut off at 50 people. If we manage to max out then I’ll raise the bar next month and we’ll figure out how to accommodate more people. When you receive your package send me a confirmation message so we can update the good trader list and keep track of who failed.

**DATES:**

•	10/10/2010 is the cut off for entry

•	10/12/2010 you will be assigned your partner

•	10/26/2010 this is the date you must ship by

**TRADE THEME**
The most popular suggestion from last month was fall seasonal. We’re talking pumpkin, harvest ales, etc.  That should be plenty of room to play. I know a lot of you sent this last month for our free-for-all and to that I say look on the bright side, you’ll have a whole new partner this time (I’ll verify no one gets the same person from last time).  Pick a different brewery; send pumpkin ale instead of marzen.  The trading size is approximately 72oz. of beer.  If you want to hit that mark with a 6 pack, a growler, or bombers , I am fine with that.  How you trade is entirely between you and your partner.

**Extras**
As a side note it is not required but is customary to pack extras with your shipment. It doesn’t have to be anything major, a loose bottle or 2 from other 6-packs, or something your area is known for. People like surprises almost as much as they like getting beer.  Plus it’s Halloween I’m sure you guys can come up with some creative.  Send candy that goes with the beer, dress up your bottles, pack it with little plastic spiders.  Your partners will thank you for going the extra mile.
questions/comments/suggestions/are always welcome.
If you experience any problems during the trade send a [message to the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23beertrade) and they will do all that is in their power to help make it right.

I have only arranged two trades thus far (which isn't looking good for my idea).  My plan B is to bring 4 packs with me into craft beer bars and hopefully trade for free drinks with the employees there

I'm looking to trade for pretty much anything.  My favorite style are imperial stouts

If you contact me and we arrange a trade, have fun, meet people, and drink a ton of really, really good beer.  If you are willing to trade, I will work with you to figure it out.  

My schedule is as follows:
January 17-18th St. Louis

**How it Works**

What happens in the BotM Club is essentially this:

* Step 1: Sign-up for it by PMing me your information.

* Step 2: I will randomize names according to region and I will assign you a partner to trade with. So everyone will be trading beer to a different part of the country.

* Step 3: You'll talk to your partner about beer styles, breweries you've heard about in your partners neighborhood you hear are amazing. It's meant to open up a dialogue.

* Step 4: Once you come to an understanding you trade shipping information and you're now obligated to ship by the date that I will set for everyone. It is usually 2 weeks after your partners are assigned.

* Step 5: Receive beer. Post photographic evidence(beer porn) in the beer haul thread and inform me of your partners delivery. We do this so everyone can be held accountable and we can track reputation points for everyone who participated.

* Step 6: Drink beer.

**DISCLAIMER** 

Homebrew does not qualify as local craft beer but can be sent as extras and is encouraged.
There are plenty microbreweries across the country; you probably live near one that a lot of us never hear about. Those are the kinds of beers we trade here. We have people that cover all corners of the country and this will be your chance to trade with one of them at random.

**What's involved**

We trade at least 72 oz. of beer (1 6-pack of 12 oz bottles, or whatever combination you want to do to make it to at least 72oz. of beer.)
Also when you commit you need to understand what is asked of you. You are expected to follow through and be accountable for the dates. If your beer is damaged or lost in the mail you will be expected to replace it. If you do not then you will not receive reputation and you will not be allowed to participate in future BotM events.
I will send email reminders about the dates but the goal is to have everyone receive their beer by the same time. Just because I set a deadline doesn't mean you have to wait until the last minute. If you and your partner trade information you can ship the very first day. I wholly encourage you to get it out earlier rather than later just in case there are complications with your shipping. 

**Theme**

This theme is of course Halloween.  So send your partner some awesome Fall/Halloween beers, the more creative the better.  Have fun with it.  

**How to Sign-Up**

To qualify we are asking that everyone who signs up have an active account at least 3 months old. This time period can only be waved if you already have trade reputation on r/beertrade.
If you have read the above and are still on board

* Your Reddit handle (yes I know that information is available when you send it to me but it just makes my life easier to copy and paste all this information.)

* Your City and State (This is all I want

* Your e-mail (So I can send mass email updates and reminders to everyone and so I don't have to rely on the Reddit Inbox)

Example:
SatansLH

Woodway

SatansLH@gmail.com 

**Note: Ship First Rule.** This is something we are enforcing this time around to help protect everyone from shady trading. For those who do not have any trade reputation yet we are going to ask you to ship first. The moment your partner has a tracking number in hand he'll get the go ahead to ship from this end. This is to help protect our existing members from beer thieves and will also be used to protect you

**IMPORTANT DATES**

* Thursday September 29th

* By October  1st

* October 17th

That gives you 2 weekends to procure beer

**Packing and Shipping Guidelines**

Anything I can tell you about packing and shipping can be found under the Trading and Packaging Tips Section
The only thing I'll reemphasize for the new people is to use FedEx or UPS.

**DO NOT USE THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE**

It is against the law to ship alcohol via USPS and can result in a fine if you are caught.

**Miscellaneous Info**

If you are not familiar with trading etiquette familiarize yourself with some of the reading material on the right side task bar. Extras are not required but once again are encouraged. It doesn't have to be more beer it can be freebies from breweries, candy, homebrew, if there's something local to your area that's not beer but would be cool to get send that along too if you wish. Any effort you make to go above and beyond for your partner is noted for future trades and makes it much more likely that they'll want to trade with you again. It's how friendships are made and trust is built out here.

**Personal Note**

My apologies to all those who were afraid I fell off the planet.  I really do love this community and I wish to continue to be a part of it.  I have just been extremely busy, cockold, ghenna, myheadhurtsalot, and familynight especially.

For the most part I understand a trade to be monetarily even. You spend $25 on your beer, then you have to arrive on the right day to buy it, then its sold in limited quantities at that.  In the end its only $5 a bottle. To me the new guy here it doesn't seem unreasonable to  ask a little more for the time and effort it takes to get it. Also, I'd be trading away the opportunity for me to drink it because I might not get it again until next year if I'm lucky then too. 

Am I being a jerk for thinking such a way? 

Edit: Thank you all. This discussion helped me put in to words better than I did above. My thoughts were $5 of KBS is not worth $5 in Budweiser. Likewise I wasn't trying to say $5 in KBS was worth $25 in Budweiser. I just wondered what the proper way to trade a rarer beer was.

I contacted Fedex on 4/23 to find out why it hadn't been delivered. They only stated that the ""trailer had been involved in an incident"" and that they'd get it delivered ASAP. I'm not a patient person, no more info, but this time I wasn't settling for ""incident"" and ""ASAP"". Two supervisors later, I finally got them to tell me that the trailer caught on fire (on 4/20, no less) and was a complete loss. Well, I guess my bottles weren't enough to help put out the fire...

So

I posted both for everyone's pleasure (add a fire to the list of ways that FedEx trucks have lost a trade box) and to ask for any advice you guys might offer to help smooth out the claims process...value of shipment, especially since I don't know if they'll actually be able to open the box and look in it or not.

I have read the ""[Read First](http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/asktf/read_first_rbeertrade_rules/)"" but still have one big question:

How do you recommend a novice gauge value in a trade? I would most likely be FT-ing some older stuff (e.g. Oud Beersel Oude Gueuze Vieille 1999) or limited stuff (Bitches Brew, Cantillon).

It is always $4$ or is there some resource/method to placing value.

To be clear: I am not afraid of getting ""ripped off"" as value is obviously subjective and I have the power to take or leave any trade based on my own value perceptions. I just want to avoid insulting or wasting the time of potential trade partners with a skewed rookie perspective.

Thanks!

PS here's my list and I will post to Wants/Gots pending some insight on the above.

If you have ever seen “Survivor”, and players will be eliminated one-by-one until there is a lone survivor remaining.  Immunity challenges will be held at scheduled dates.  The winner(s) of the challenges will be immune to elimination for that round.  Players then vote for the person they would like to eliminate.  The player with the most votes is eliminated from the game.

Hope we haven't lost anyone yet.  Here are some more specific details.  We'll start with 16 players, while the other tribe must vote one of their members out of the game.  When we're down to 10 total players, we'll merge tribes and all immunity challenges will become individual challenges, meaning that only one person will win immunity after each challenge.  Players eliminated in challenges #8-14 will form the Tribal Council, and will ultimately help decide the winner of the Survivor BIF.

Still with me?  Great!  If you're interested in participating, and we want to make sure that all players will be able to fully participate.

The reputation system is based on points. 

* You earn 1 point each time you complete a trade with someone.
* Participating in moderator-sponsored community trading events will give additional reputation points.  Rep points for group trades are updated all at once after the group trade is completed.
* If someone is falsely claiming a trade with you

Reputation points translate into a reputation level.  There are 5 reputation levels:

* Level 1 - 1 point
* Level 2 - 5 points
* Level 3 - 10 points
* Level 4 - 40 points
* Level 5 - 100+ points

We will maintain a centralized list of everyone's reputation (see sidebar)

Here is the basic premise: this is not a traditional beer trade, where the first person (I guess that would be me this time) selects a member of the trade ring to receive the next growler. Once that person has received their leg of the trade, they then select a member to continue the trade with, and so on and so forth until the ring completes. 

The idea is to send a local favorite that isn't available in the area of the recipient. Try to choose beers that aren't bottled or widely distributed. The max growler price will be $25

The bare necessity is one 64 oz growler of local brew

Because of the lengthy time inherent in a trade ring like this, as we don't want people waiting for their growlers 3 months down the road. Sign ups will also be limited to traders with established reputation, sorry newbies.

Obviously communication is key to making this work - make sure you get in contact with your trade recipient as soon as possible to find out where their tastes lie and to get all of their pertinent shipping info. I will maintain a trade list to monitor the progress of the trades - please post your updates to this thread (with beer porn preferably).

So - anybody interested? Please respond with your city

Cheers!

1352998356.0,138vwl,"ISO: Specific brewery CAPS ; FT: CCB, $, capswap",RuskiesInTheWarRoom,11,19

Let me explain: a local pet shop makes animal ID tags out of bottle caps

Problem: I'm in Florida

I am in search of a specific list of bottle CAPS - usually from very common beers:

* New Belgium (Classic NB logo with the bike) (x2 - 4)
* ODell (x2)
* Allagash White
* New Glarus (specifically Spotted Cow)
* From Chicago: Half Acre or Revolution (do they bottle/have individual caps?)

Here's the challenge/caveat : the caps can *not* be bent - they need to be pried off the bottles with care so as to bend them as minimally as possible for the maker to use them. So:

I'm willing to do a **bottle-for-bottle** trade for equivalents available here, -OR- **pay** a small bit of money per cap and shipping.

Looking to do this ASAP so that I can get them made and delivered by the holidays. To make it a bit easier on me

Thanks!

OK I called the international shipping department of UPS and they asked just for more description of the contents. Following advice from several places (http://biergotter.org/intltips.shtml) I told her that I believe the young man at the UPS store did not ask for enough information, which I did not provide.

$4$ seems to be fair play here ... if/when an offer comes we'll work it all out. 

And finally

1321166165.0,maius,"FT: 3Floyds XV Anniversary 'Baller Stout'..  ISO: DFH 120, Olde School, Burton Baton..",bedintruder,9,11, Surly

From the bottle: *""This massive stout is the combined effort of Three Floyds, we brewed Darklord, Darkness, Black Albert and Beer Geek Brunch with our friends at our brewery and blended them. This is a celebration of, not only our fifteen years, but also the international craft brewing industry and those of you that support it. Cheers and thanks, FFF.""*

I am really only looking to trade a bottle or two of these for some of the three Dogfish Head beers in the title; 120 Minute, but bear in mind one or two bottles isn't going to cut it.  These bottles are already reaching $70+ each on ebay.

**EDIT: Since there seems to be some confusion on what I'm looking to get for this beer, I'm not concerned with age of the beer I'm looking to get. When it comes to Olde School or Burton Baton, I would need multiple 4-packs of these. When it comes to 120 Minute, I'm looking for at least a 4-pack of this.


I do also have a couple of the rare barrel aged beers from Floyds that I got at the XV Anniversary. I'm not completely against trading them

If any of you have been wondering why november 9-10 came and went without announcement for the next Beer of the Month club it is essentially because I've been under some crunch time at school.  If I'm not at class I'm at work and when I'm not at work I'm writing papers and studying.  If I did one this month I would not be able to devote the time I think is necessary to make things run smoothly and it wouldn't have been fair to all of you.  I'm sorry to those who were looking forward to another round.  

With that being said I'm going to call November a wash and focus on r/beertrade's Secret Santa Christmas edition.  I'll announce around thanksgiving so there is plenty of time for packages to arrive before Christmas.
