I'm fairly sure I'll get a lot of hate for making this post (or at least get downvoted to oblivion)

With Live 8, but right now it's just not ready for launch.

It's not hard to imagine reasons why Ableton might ship an incomplete product. They've been hyping it for a while, etc... Regardless of their reasoning, it's unacceptable for them to ship a broken product. By buying Live 9 right now, you'd be sending Ableton the message that it's okay for them to do this.

So if standing up for good business practices isn't enough to convince you

* A new smart snap feature that takes the place of ""snap to grid"". You can not disable this feature
* A new browser that will break many user's workflow.
* Strangely shaped and inconsistent automation curves.
* Group lanes can't be collapsed like they were in Live 8 without closing the group itself.
* Not all M4L devices function in Live 9 64-bit.
* Many users are reporting that the Live 9 indexer eats up CPU.
* Many reports of ""near constant crashing.""
* Recorded samples may be deleted after being saved.
* BPM missing from MIDI clips
* No more quick envelope buttons in clip view for pitch bend
* Joining midi clips in arrangement view may make seemingly random alterations to your notes
* Many 3rd party MIDI remote scripts are broken. Most notably all Maschine scripts I'm aware of are unusable. The NI developer who does the official one was quoted as saying that due to the lack of documentation and many changes to the LOM + Python API
* No more FF1 mode on the compressor for sidechaining or transient shaping.

That's just a very small snapshot. There are literally hundreds of other small bugs that are too specific to really talk about. Things like that the new mono sequencer won't play notes if you freeze/flatten a track.

Not only that

* Dual monitor support.
* Delay compensation for automation.
* Bounce clip to audio.
* Ability to type automation values.
* Automation snap-to-grid
* Nested grouping
* Improved MIDI spec
* Multitake comping
* Retina/HiDPI support
* Support for 32-bit plugins in 64-bit Live
* etc.. etc.. etc..

TL;DR: Ableton Live 9 is shipping with many bugs. I do not support their decision to release it before it's ready

Edits: revised wording/punctuation + added to example sections.

Edit: Okay so people in here seem to be overwhelmingly arguing points inconsequential to my actual argument so I obviously wasn't clear enough.

**This is not about the existing features, how often you will run in to bugs.** Those are the main arguments I'm seeing, and all are irrelevant to this post. This is a moral/business ethics issue.

All software has bugs. Usually bugs are fixed as they are found. The problem with this launch is that that there is a massive list of known/acknowledged/reproducible bugs, building a list, prioritizing, etc... They are launching without addressing a large majority of the reported problems. Also, they are launching without letting their users know that this is even an issue. Beta testers asked again and again to see a list of known bugs to help us more efficiently find problems (so we wouldn't waste our time reporting duplicate bugs) but Ableton has refused to show that list. Doesn't that come off as a bit shady?

I made an analogy below, the windshield wipers scraped gouges in the windshield, airbags wouldn't deploy if a collision was too hard, the engine wasn't well mounted to the car and could become loose, etc... But the company was on a deadline so they decided to start selling the car anyways with the agreement that if any issue happened you could have it fixed for free at a service center. Would you buy that car?",,False,t5_2rbt4,True

*Hidden buttons visible when in midi or key assign mode =
scene up/down (in master track).
per track play button - launches selected clip in track.

*Entering bpm in the scene launch buttons title sets bpm when launched.

*Click the headphone icon in midi editor to enable vertical keyboard to preview related sound.

*While MIDI synced to external machine hosting Live ALT+SPACEBAR on the sync slave causes it to sync to the masters current song position. (remedy for sync drifting without stopping and starting).

*Remember to experiment with the default live rack presets especially the DJ/Performance ones.

*GIGA libraries can be exported to Sampler then deleted (if required)

*Mac users check out a free app called Soundsource. It adds an audio prefs selector to the menu-bar.

*OSX Function keys = ALT+F1/F2 opens Display Prefs

*When a new version of Live is released. Open Info Window (SHIFT+/) and hover any new parameters

*Multiple tracks can be selected and frozen simultaneously.

*Drag and drop tracks directly from iTunes for DJing.

*Dragging a sample onto a plugin instrument will replace the instrument with an instance of Simpler containing that sample.

1375457513.0,1jkhif,Ill.Gates tells How To Approach Music Making with Ableton Live,darlingpinky,53,13,18,"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVQ8c19unnM

This video has helped me more than any other advice I have ever received in my 3 years of learning and producing music using Ableton Live. Psychological Organization - it's a very important and often overlooked piece of the puzzle. Ill.Gates tells how so many people try to make up for their lack of organization by buying equipment they won't need (I myself am guilty of this), buy more more more. 

He lays it down very plainly. Until you have your head right, none of the awesome VSTs you have will add to your arsenal. It's like going to war with tons of guns but no strategy. Organization and approach, to me, are the number one thing that people lack, and no one can teach you that but yourself. You need to figure out the elements you want in your music. You need to look at your approach as reproducible and abstractable, so you can come up with a singular approach to music making. This will advance your production much faster than starting each piece without knowing what direction to take. You will also enjoy it a lot more because you are not distracted by what I call ""meta-issues"" - things that just come in the way of the issues you are really trying to deal with - things such as layering, audio issues, not configuration and workflow issues. He also tells us how to split our time between sound design and song creation. It's very important to differentiate between the two

Anyways, but this first one is free. I wish I could afford the entire series, but alas. Hope this helps you guys as much as it has helped me. 

P.S.: His music is very reminiscent of Bassnectar (who he has worked with). Those of you who like Bassnectar may be interested in checking out his album ill.Methodology. I hope this doesn't come off as I'm adveritising for him or anything

EDIT: I guess a short intro description of what this is would be useful. This is an Ableton DJ template that sorta-kinda emulates 2 deck mixing, which can be downloaded [here](http://tarekith.com/assets/TarekithDJEFXv8.5.zip). I'll answer any questions best I can!

My cheap DJ setup

Materials: 

	Ableton Live 8

Korg [NanoKontrol](http://www.amazon.com/Korg-nanoKONTROL-USB-Controller-
White/dp/B001H2P294/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1322396404&amp;amp;sr=8-1) ($40)

Behringer [UCA-202](http://www.amazon.com/Behringer-UCA202-Audio-
Interface/dp/B000KW2YEI/ref=sr_1_1?s=musical-instruments&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1322396456&amp;amp;sr=1-1) ($27)

Step 1: Creating a custom audio interface using the UCA-202 and your laptop's integrated sound card (I only 
know how to do this for Mac

	Plug in the USB cable of the UCA-202 to your laptop.

	For Mac users

	Click the + icon on the lower left hand corner. This should create a new Aggregate Device.

	Check the boxes next to 'USB Audio Codec' and 'Built-in Output'

	Rename the aggregate device to whatever.

FOR WINDOWS:
First off download/install asio4all, then the Audio tab. Set Driver Type to Asio, then audio device to asio4all (should say asio4allv2 or something). Click 'Hardware Setup' and the asio4all control panel should open. On the left you should see your computers primary sound driver, and your 2 channel soundcard. If not, try clicking the wrench button. Click the power buttons on the side to turn them both on. Now it sets up your outputs in the order listed there, so if your computers default driver is first outputs 1&amp;2 will be your laptop's headphone jack, and 3&amp;4 will be the sound card. This means in Ableton your main output might need to be 3&amp;4. Close the asio4all control panel, click 'Output Config' and enable everything.


Step 2: Setting up cueing from your custom audio interface

	Open Ableton. 

Open [this project file](http://www.mediafire.com/?34okvbs4gcbdbts)

	Open Prefereces -&gt; Audio

	For ""Audio Output Device"" choose your custom audio interface.

	Click on ""Output config""

	Enable everything. Close preferences.

	In Session View, set master out to 3/4 and cue to 
1/2

	Close the I-O tab to maximize screen real estate.


Step 3: Setting up your Korg NanoKontrol

	Connect your Korg NanoKontrol via USB

Download the [Template](http://www.mediafire.com/?uy57m4v5yq6c153)

	Open the Korg Kontrol Editor (I think it comes in a cd with the nanoKontrol)

	File -&gt; Open -&gt; Template

	Then Communication -&gt; Write Scene Set

	Close Korg Kontrol Editor

Step 4: Putting it all together

Download [this PDF](http://www.mediafire.com/?85z6m1958w65mzt) and refer to it for the following controls:

	1. Deck A Autofilter High Cut (activate effect with button below knob)

	2. Deck A Autofilter Low Cut (activate effect with button below knob)

	3. Deck A EQ Low 

	4. Deck A EQ Mid

	5. Deck A EQ High

	6. Deck A PingPong Delay Send

	7. Deck B Autofilter High Cut (activate effect with button below knob)

	8. Deck B Autofilter Low Cut (activate effect with button below knob)

	9. Deck B EQ Low

	10. Deck B EQ Mid

	11. Deck B EQ High

	12. Deck B PingPong Delay Send

	13. Deck A Beat Repeat

	14. Deck A Volume

	15. Deck B Beat Repeat

	16. Deck B Volume

	17. Session Tempo (125-128

	18. Crossfader (down is A

	19. Deck A Stop

	20. Deck B Stop

Something I've always found fascinating is the effort many producers put into their kick drums. Yesterday I spent roughly 2 hours making a kick within an instrument rack, saturation, EQ and Mono.

What amazed me here is just how phenomenal this kick sounds in comparison to, compress accordingly, and generally you can create something fully unique and your own, that's 100x better than just a sample. On top of that, you can individually add effects to different parts of the spectrum; I'm playing with a bit of reverb on the high click of my kick to give a 'big room' feel, while adding a haas delay via Filter Delay on the mid/high range so the kick sounds wider, while still having a mono bass/sub.

Anyway

**The solution is to use a modified version of the Push script**, there is no purpose for the drum rack. Below the drum rack chain, there is a chain for Battery 3 in which I have loaded up NI's Battery 3 VST. The trick that makes this work is that all incoming MIDI notes are directed into both chains and the Battery 3 VST will play any notes that are being sequenced or incoming from a MIDI clip. 

The second feature this modified script enables is velocity sensitivity in the step-sequencer. In the original Push script, it will actually record the velocity with which you strike the step. This enables some truly expressive control over the step-sequencer. I can't believe they didn't originally have this feature in the step-sequencer.

[Here is the link](https://www.box.com/s/lxpem3jnnqgl0in742sn) for the Control Surface script to make this work. I originally found it in [this post](https://forum.ableton.com/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=191287)  in the Ableton Live forums. The installation instructions are included in the download

Anyways, thanks to this modified script, we can. All credit goes to the editor of this script. Thanks!

Often I go on this subreddit and see some novice level questions. Let me get this straight

I know how that sounds. ""Thanks

Lately I haven't been paying attention in class because honestly Film History and Business Ethics are pretty fucking boring. So to fill in the time I've been reading articles about synthesis techniques, **many** manuals. I have a folder on my desktop dedicated just to software manuals. I've been pretty good with NI's Massive for a while, but after reading the manual my workflow became significantly faster. Not to mention it was just generally interesting to me to know more about the intricacies of the software.

Live's manual is a doozy, things I previously thought were complex are now simple using tools of the software I didn't know how to use before.

**TL;DR** Please read your manuals. It will benefit you greatly. And it's not even boring. Personally I enjoy reading them.

**EDIT**: If you don't have the manual and don't want to waste your time looking around sketchy websites to find it,False,self,t5_2rbt4,1352413383.0,,,t3_12vl5b

[Download Link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/iy9acjoovzs5yln/64%20Pad%20Drum%20Rack.adg)


In addition, Upper Left is QII, Lower Left is QIII, and Lower Right is QIV, as in a Cartesian Plane.


**IMPORTANT: You cannot use this preset with Push in the default Scale!!!** You must switch the mode to Sequential Up. To do this, which says ""Sequent^"". Then, back in the Scales menu, select ""Chromatic"". Keep it in the key of C, or enable Fixed mode. These steps ensure that all notes on the drum racks will be playable, and that no notes will be repeated. Unfortunately, you won't be able to use Push's step sequencer


I've also included a macro which disables velocity sensitivity so you can play the Push like a Launchpad. I prefer this when playing samples other than drums, you can insert an instrument that isn't a drum rack into one of the slots, but it will stay in C Chromatic unless you add the Scale MIDI Effect.

**Updated Browser:**

•	Two pane

•	Categories - Program sorts sounds/clips/plugins/etc. automatically from within the Libraries

•	Places - Some default (i.e. Packs

•	All built-in devices (i.e. synth patches

•	Search function now indexes in the background when other tasks aren’t being performed. It also tries to index everything at one time. This keeps the search times much lower after it has been used for a bit.

•	New enabled/disabled columns within the content browser pane:

•	Place – Location within browser of file or pack

•	Rank - Program ranks the most commonly used folders and files



**Arrange Mode Interface:**

•	Added pre-roll option to metronome button. Helpful for recording.

•	Global groove value % has been added back to the top control bar. This only becomes visible once a groove value has been applied.

•	Quantization Menu has moved to left

•	Overdub button “OVR” has been replaced with “+”. Same functionality

•	Added “Automation Arm” button allowing for the recording of manual parameter changes to both arrangement and session mode clips.

•	Replaced back to arrangement button with “Re-Enable Automation”. This performs exactly the same way except it only returns automation and not audio.

o	Back to arrangement audio is now done per track using new arrows that appear

o	Back to arrangement button is still available within Session Mode in lower right corner



•	Draw mode switch (B) is now on the right side of the screen

•	Arrange Mode and Clip view now have phrase shading. Time signatures adjusts the shading appropriately. Very helpful for maintaining phrasing in arrangement.

•	“Save as default audio track” - Right-click context menu



**Audio to MIDI:**

•	Convert harmony to MIDI – Takes an audio clip and converts to sustained MIDI notes and polyphonic chords. This is especially good for full track or multiple instrument extraction. It analyzes and creates a new MIDI track with instrument rack containing a piano which can then be mapped to anything.

•	Convert melody to MIDI – Designed more for monophonic note extraction taking the dominant notes and laying them over a MIDI clip. This is great for baselines. It analyzes and creates a new MIDI track with an instrument rack. Auto loads a rack containing an Analog synth that can blend between synth and piano.

•	Convert drums to MIDI – Analyzes and creates new MIDI track with drum rack. Auto maps sound to default 606 percussion sounds attempting to match the audio.

•	This not only recognizes the sounds and pitches but also the velocity of the MIDI notes.



**MIDI clip controls:**

•	Easy transpose by min/max notes

•	:2/*2 – Half/Double tempo. This works the same as audio clips have had previously

•	Rev – Reverses the rhythmic pattern of the clip or selection

•	Inv – Inverts the notes within the clip or selection keeping the hi/lo values

•	Legato – Lengthens all of the notes to the beginning of the next note played

•	Dupl. Loop – Doubles the length of the clip and duplicates the notes.

•	Selection flexible drag scaling on notes

o	May also click and drag within the selection to stretch

o	Also works for clip envelope automation



**All clip controls:**

•	Track automation within clips:

o	Must have clip selected

o	Start by right clicking on device parameter and click “Show Modulation”

o	Can edit same as envelopes (includes looping)

o	This is additive to any normal track automation


•	Single click to add/remove nodes

•	Click just below to drag full selection

•	Automation/Envelope curves (Hold Alt/Option)



“Consolidate time to new scene” – This not only takes and selection within the arrangement and creates a scene but also brings over automation. This is incredibly helpful for taking an arrangement into the session mode for performance.



**Session Mode:**

•	“O” button - Session record. This starts recording on all armed tracks within the selected scene

•	“New” button – Prepares scene for new recording. Stops recording on all armed tracks

•	“Back To Arrangement” button moved to lower right corner



**Effects:**

•	EQ 8: 

o	Spectrum Analyzer

o	Breaks out for better editing

o	Modes for L/R or A/B editing

o	Scaling – Perfect for solving issues with competing frequencies


•	Gate:

o	Now shows gating activity

o	“Return” &amp;amp; “Floor” control added


•	Compressor:

o	Now has activity view

o	Both gain reduction and Output options


•	Glue Compressor 

o	Designed to be similar to a SSL compressor

o	Intended to be pushed a bit harder and used on multiple tracks at one time

o	Includes dry/wet which is helpful



**Max for Live:**

•	M4L is now included with Suite purchase - Well worth it!

•	Excellent free plugins and packs available for download:

o	Max for Live Essentials

o	Includes Convolution Reverb – Very powerful!

o	M4L Pluggo for Live

o	M4L Granulator

o	M4L Building Tools – Create your own plugins


•	Lots of great user created plugins available:

o	JC Reverser

o	Already Played

o	Fire Scene At Set Time



Somewhat skinable within the preferences menu. Brightness


Upload to Soundcloud option available for Exporting audio.


VST support – Live now offers a 64 bit version. However, there is really no need for anyone to install the 64 bit version as its only advantage is that it can use more than 4GB of memory (processor usage or sound rendering is not affected!). Most projects will not need this much memory allocated.

Here's the thing. I trigger samples on my laptop using my iPad and sing live. All of the sound is going through my audio interface (Mackie Onyx 820i) I have a click coming out of the headphone port of my Macbook by setting up an aggregate device. 

Every now and then, for some reason is out. It's not on the beat - slightly out. Usually, it's not that big of a deal because I just stop all samples and it sorts itself out. Not this time, however - the click this time was out at the beginning (I had to restart Live in the middle of a gig) - it corrected itself, but then during a loud track, the click once again went out. On stage we couldn't hear too much because the drums were so loud, but offstage it sounded like utter garbage as the drummer was drumming to a different click . . . 

Obviously we have to get this sorted as we have another gig next week. 

Is this a processing issue? I have a 2009 (I believe) macbook pro with 2.8ghz

Could this be an issue with the new interface I just bought? The Mackie? 

It's also worth mentioning that I changed the sound of the click in Live's settings - i.e. replaced the samples, I have just put the original samples back in there place and it is STILL not working and going out of time.

I can't find anything about this on the web

[This is what it sounds like.](http://drop.io/griwcmf)

1) start new session with 3 audio tracks and 1 return track. setup track routing as follows:

* 1 Audio: Audio From - No Input
* 2 Audio: Audio From - No Input
* 3 Audio: Audio From - No Input, Record Armed
* A Return/A Utility: Audio To - 1-Audio

**EDIT:** zap-rowsdower has pointed out that Live does not allow monitoring of tracks with neither an input set or an output being routed to it. so setting No Input before Monitor In won't work. set the Audio To for all 3 tracks first

An alternative routing pattern such as the following will work:

* 1 Audio: Audio From - A-Return/A-Utility
* 2 Audio: Audio From - 1-Audio
* 3 Audio: Audio From - 2-Audio
* A Return/A Utility: Audio To - Sends Only

routing 1 to 2 and 2 from 1 doubles gain

**END EDIT**

2) drop a Utility on the Return track with DC filter on

3) get some noise started with either a sample on track 1 or some crackle from the Vinyl Distortion effect.

4) turn up Send A on track 1 to get some feedback going. 

5) drop effects into track 1 and tweak your heart out. use EQ8 to boost the low end for lots of rumblies.

other really fun effects include

* Grain Delay
* Frequency Shifter
* Redux
* Resonators
* Erosion
* etc.

and now you know the only thing i know how to do with Live that isn't common knowledge.

I ran into [LPC-Live](http://www.nativekontrol.com/LPC-Live.html) for the Launchpad a few months ago and thought it was amazing. But I didn't notice **TrackDefs** then (you don't need a specific controller).



*TrackDefs is a configurable MIDI remote script for Live 8.1.3 or later that allows you to define default settings to use for inserted Tracks. Unlike other remote scripts, or a QWERTY or a mouse.*


Here is a step by step tutorial for setting the Auto Arm Selected Track feature


First go to [this page](http://beatwise.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=production&amp;action=display&amp;thread=709) and grab the current free version of TrackDefs. *The folder named ‘TrackDefs’ needs to be placed in Live’s MIDI Remote Script directory. Please close Live before transferring this folder.*

*On Windows

*On OS X, right-click and select Show Package Contents. 2. The directory is located in: Contents\App-Resources.*

*In Ableton the following settings will be found in Preferences on the MIDI/Sync tab.*
*Select TrackDefs as a Control Surface.*
*Leave the Input and Output set to None.*

Then you’ll need to go modify the file named TrackDefsUserConfig.py

Look for ""EXCLUSIVE_ARM_ON_SELECT = 0"" and simply replace 0 by 1. That's it! *DO NOT change any of the spacing in this file. DO NOT change the name of this file or its file extension. When done making your changes

Check the few **other settings** in the TrackDefsUserConfig.py file and check **LPC-Live**



Note: 
If you are using Live 8.3:

*On Windows with 8.3

*On OSX with 8.3, right-click on it and select Show Package Contents. Within the package, the MIDI Remote Scripts directory is where it has always been: Contents/App-Resources/MIDI Remote Scripts*

I'll start.  For the rack I mentioned above, a crush/fade-out effect with a lo-pass filter going high to low combined with a reverb and a bitcrusher.  Lastly, it has a Chorus and Phaser combo that spaces everything out and makes it sound swirly.

So until lately I've been very much an analog person. The convenience of having pristine drum samples at the touch of a keyboard is just too hard to resist



I've picked up a few sample packs of drums and have a question about the high hat. The packs all seem to follow a similar pattern; they have samples for hitting a closed hat


What I can't understand is the open hat. The samples are long so the sound gradually rolls off. What's the ideal practice to take the open hat sample and mix it with the foot pedal? I'm trying to simulate the open hat's noise stopping similar to when a drummer hits the foot pedal.

It seems like the samples are made to be edited this way because of how much room there is in the sample. This seems like such a simple question I feel kinda stupid for asking it.

i've been working on a design for a custom ableton live control surface. the idea is to have a compact clip controller that automatically integrates itself with ableton live.

i know my own needs for this, it's not for you) or the general format of the box.

the platform is MIDIbox. some of you may have heard of it. this particular box is using 32 bit microcontroller and the entire system is USB powered. the code for the MIDIbox is written by myself in C, you simply load the script like any other control surface. the usb drivers are already on your computer.

once the script is loaded, and a universal box with a graphical lcd that will be used to automatically adapt to the device you're using (i.e. after an initial setup, the box can ""follow"" what instrument you've selected, adapt it's knobs/switches accordingly, and put the parameter names on the lcd). so keep in mind that universal functionality in this box isn't necessary. i just want to control clips in a manner that is useful both live an in the studio. step sequencing and other functions are also planned in the future.


the interface:

the interface has 64 tactile buttons and and 59 3 color leds (green

the main section has buttons that trigger a 5 (scene) x 8 (track) grid of clips. the leds above each button give feedback based on what's going on in live. red if a clip exists but is not playing, and orange if a clip is playing or looping (these might change).

the 5 buttons (vertical) to the right launch scenes.

the 8 buttons across the bottom stop the playing clip on the track

the left side has play/stop controls, and each has led feedback to show the state.

the bottom left are the bank buttons. the script puts the famous red box around the clips on live's interface

prev is a preview button. if you ""get lost"" on the button grid

sel is a select button. holding select and pressing a clip button will activate that clip and make live show clip detail at the bottom. using select with a stop button will activate the track and show device view. select and scene will activate that scene, but it's an idea).

the alt button will allow many other parameters to be changed at once. the first row of clip leds will now show which tracks are muted

finally


the case:

the case is aluminum and is sold in several colors, or other options such as lasertrans can be used. the overall size of the case is quite small: 7.38"" x 4.70"" x 1.30"" (188mm x 119.5mm x 33mm). i'm estimating that the cost to build will be around $150 - 200. i realize that something like a novation launchpad can be bought for the same price, but money is not a reason to DIY.

finally

thanks!

1357564730.0,1649oa,How about some AutoHotkey scripts?,stirringdesert,11,0,10,"Hi there. Seems like this theme hasn't been covered here yet so here we go.

For those who don't know AutoHotkey is basically an application that alows you to create your own hotkeys for any program you want. It's based on a pretty advanced scripting language which means you can make some crazy stuff with it.

I'm only learing but here's what I've come up with so far:

    #ifwinactive
    
    MButton::
    Send {Ctrl Down}
    Send {Alt Down}
    Send {LButton Down}
    return
    MButton Up::
    Send {Ctrl Up}
    Send {Alt Up}
    Send {LButton Up}
    return
    
    xbutton1::numpadadd
    return
    xbutton2::numpadsub
    return

    VKC0::+Tab
    return
    

It's very basic but it works. The script does three things:

* Makes it so that I can use middle mouse button as a touchscreen-type-navigation-scroll-thing (instead of Live's default ctrl-alt hotkey). Much more comfortable instead of using scroll wheel and time ruller in my opinion;
* Mirrors the hotkeys for zooming in and out on extra buttons on my mouse;
* Mirrors the hotkey for switching betwen the bottom instrument/effects view and clip contents view on tilda key.

So feel free to share the scripts that you are using.",self,t5_2rbt4,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/abletonlive/comments/1649oa/how_about_some_autohotkey_scripts/

Here You can see the names of some of the songs from our live sets. For 'Darkness' you'll see two instances; each of these is in fact an instrument rack with the reFX Nexus loaded

Create an instrument rack for each patch you want access to during a live session. Now the little doo-hickeys called Zones (dark blue bars) are the MIDI ranges captured by the chain selector. First, now assign a block of MIDI channels to each rack instance (in this example I've assigned 0-9; 10-19; 20-29, etc.). Now right click the ruler again and assign to a macro (in my case I assigned macro 1).

Now MIDI map Macro 1 to a potentiometer on your control surface (tweedly knob or slider). Boom. Done.

I'd really appreciate any advice or feedback anyone can provide!

Edit #2: Found another possible fix for dealing with the Note Repeat syncing issue.

-On the MPD32

-Tap the note repeat button and then hit edit on mpd. Change the swing to 50. It is set as 58 on default 

-In Ableton's preferences, set MPD to 1/4 and adjust the delay untill you can see that the notes get laid down exactly on the right spot when recording.

-Tips for mixing drums within a drum rack?

-Do I REALLY need to bounce every track to audio and mix that (i.e. take out all the VST's)? I've seen several tutorials mention this but it seems more trouble than its worth.

-Tips for what effects to put on the master track?

-(this may be dumb/obvious but...) If I have synth that's playing solo for a few bars, do I need to manually fill in the space left by the other instruments (by increasing the volume) or is this sort of automatic?

Moved on to Cubase and stuck with that for pretty much all my work to this point.  I've tried other DAWs like Sonar

This would help a good deal in my workflow.  I have a few different midi controllers but nothing mapped out which I think would help too.

I'm a longtime user of Reason and Sonar so I'm familiar with working with DAWs but neither of those options are really great for playing live. My goal is to use Ableton with a Novation Launchpad to trigger several samples.

Here's where I'm kind of stuck and could use some feedback:

1. Since our songs' BPMs vary I've got a single live set configured with a single scene for each of our songs. The problem is moving between the scenes so that the BPMs take effect. The only way I can see to do this is to start playing each scene which starts playing all of the samples. 

2. Setting up Ableton to be a slave for the midi sync clock seems extremely buggy. I'm using a USB midi cable but every time I change the tempo on my Micron it seems to just get disconnected.  We're using the Micron as the master clock because it sends the midi clock without having to send a start/stop. This is preferable since a lot of our songs don't start with the drums. If there was an easier option we'd be open to changing this. ",self,t5_2rbt4,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/abletonlive/comments/1ajrex/new_to_ableton_and_trying_to_figure_out_the_best/

I got an Allen &amp; Heath Xone:K2 MIDI controller last week and realised that Ableton does not recognise MIDI release commands as a separate signal and that the main ways to do this involve Bome's MIDI Translator (expensive)


I spent all day researching on the internet to find that this was a well requested feature and entirely without response from the community.

Everyone called me crazy but I knew in my heart that it could be done.

In the end I managed to refine the method down to a single dummy clip.


&gt;Now you can easily Hold down a midi note to turn on your effect and let go of the note to turn it back off!

So

http://www.everydayswag.org/ableton/PunchFX.zip


The trick was to forget all about MIDI release recognition and focus on the Input signal.


I've done it by having a dummy clip with launch quantization of 1/32 with repeat mode on and loop off.
The first half of the clip sends CC 'on' signal and the second half sends CC 'off' to the beat repeat.
It's constantly being launched before getting to the second half so the beat repeat only knows on until you let go of the clip and it plays out to the end.
The really great thing about this method is that because it uses CC to modify the values so you can assign another MIDI note to the same parameters as the dummy clips and have two separate controls for the same effect.
I've got it set up so that the dummy clips change the beat divisions as well as a knob for MAXIMUM control!



Hope this helps everyone a little bit :D

But one thing I can't seem to find a good solution for is looping... Seems there are 3 main ways to go about it in live which all have pretty major drawbacks:

   

**Native clip looping**

* can only control loops on the currently active clip.
* no way to double/half the loop length with midi controls.
* loops are stored to the clip so next time you launch the clip it'll jump into the previously set loop without any warning.
* overwrites any loop already set on a clip (can't loop a section of a bigger loop and then jump back into the saved loop like you can with traktor cue points for instance).

**The looper device**

* seems great at first but after dividing the loop in half you can't increase it again; it forgets about the 2nd half of the loop.
* the song keeps playing in the background so when deactivating the loop you don't know where the song will be.

**Beat repeat device**

* allows you to half/double the loop but max loop length is only one bar.
* same as above... The song keeps playing in the background. 

Am I missing something that would help me achieve what I'm after? I know a lot of people are using live for DJing so surely there's a better solution out there.

I don't really want to be stuck with everything at the same volume all the time and I don't want to be limited to just dropping volume of the entire kit. There's also EQ and reverb automations that I'd really like to have available. 

Its a bummer if I'm not overlooking something because Battery seems to be a really nice drum synth so far.

**Edit:** Thought of another issue I was having. The length of my midi notes does not apply to the length of the sample being cued. Say I have a cowbell sample from Battery and I want to do a short short long pattern. Normally with a drum rack I could make the first two notes 32nd notes in length to get just the very beginning attack of the sample and make the last note an 8th note for the full decay. Battery just plays all it's samples at full length regardless of the length of the midi note controlling it.

**Edit 2:** I found a solution to automation. If you open Battery click the sample you want and in the Cell tab change the Channel send under the volume slider to one of the numbers. Now create an audio track change the extension to Battery and then from the sub menu under extension choose your corresponding send channel. Go nuts with automation and effects.

Still havent found a solution to the length of samples as they relate to the midi notes though.",self,t5_2rbt4,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/abletonlive/comments/hx73b/who_is_using_battery_with_ableton/

I couldn't really find a hip hop/rap producing forum or anything so I am posting this here as I would like to use Ableton.

I have always really been into music and lately have really been into rap/hip hop beats. I never seriously considered trying to make anything of my own for whatever reason. Luckily I got over that and I am ready to take the big step but I need to sort some stuff out and I hope you can help!

First of all where should I start exactly? It seems that tutorials like Tom Cosm's are more directed at electro house and other electronic genres and not so much rap/hip hop

So lets say I start and I am really enjoying myself and decide to get some equipment. What should I get? I looked up a list and it mentioned things that most producers use like a keyboard, record player, phono preamp, and a bunch of other stuff. 
What gear is priority? I guess it would be the record player/phono preamp and a ton of vinyl

Speaking of vinyl is sampling from vinyl better than if I were to sample from mp3s? I know better is super super subjective but it seems like vinyl samples are a little more forward and powerful sounding, its hard to sit at my computer and force myself to work with my music collection when it is so easy to go online and try to find something better. Also I feel like finding the record and sampling it myself might give me more of a feeling of accomplishment personally. And I would have a bunch of vinyl which would be cool.

What about music theory? What do I need to learn? What can I learn from?

Thanks!

1363159165.0,1a7cs0,"Opening Ableton live 8 suite save in Ableton live 9 standard, instrument little problem, anyone have a work around for me?",archyriel,6,9
And the issue here is when I go to open the file in AL9 it defaults to a temporary 'unauthorized' copy where i can't save or export because the AL9 standard doesn't come with the Sampler. Of course it goes back to 'authorized' when i restart ableton
Now I don't particularly want to flat out buy the sampler just so I can have my project back because I just spent $300 on AL9.... So can anyone give me a how to fix this without doing anything illegal?


**Edit** Okay what appears to have worked is opening the project in live, thanks everyone!",,False,self,t5_2rbt4,1363229498.0,,

1362693559.0,19vdwk,Step Sequencer using Launchpad and padKontrol,darlingpinky,6,2,4,"I posted this in the Ableton Live forums but got no response. Hoping this subreddit will have someone that could help me out. Here's the original text of the post:

&gt;Anyone know of a way to create a step-sequencer using a Launchpad to select the note and padKontrol to enter the steps for the selected note? I recently purchased a padKontrol and have already had a Launchpad. On the Launchpad, but that also only provides capability to step sequence only on the padKontrol. 
&gt;
&gt;Ideally
&gt;
&gt;1. On the Launchpad
&gt;2. The ""steps"" would be shown on the padKontrol. Each of the 16 pads would be a step.
&gt;3. The current step marker would move from top left to bottom right of the pad matrix for each iteration of the loop.
&gt;4. When I hit a pad
&gt;
&gt;So this sounds simple enough, please post back and I will try to clarify by either posting a video or going into more detail.",,False,self,t5_2rbt4,1362944611.0,,
1362595558.0,19sg3t,Problems Using Ableton Live,foreverclever,7,3,12,"Hi all

- Select a track
- Switch to a different instrument (from the keyboard) and record another part that would be recorded to a clip as well
- Continue recording parts for different instruments

Also, can you have it play a click just for the first couple bars you play then not the rest?

Any help would be awesome,False,self,t5_2rbt4,False,,,t3_19sg3t
1361726526.0,1950jb,Audio to midi for controlling the looper,jakekoo,5,0,9,"I´m trying to make an environment in which I could play my keyboard controller and use Lives looper audio effect. I have got two sustain pedals

I plugged my other sustain pedal in to one of my audio interfaces audio inputs and am trying to turn it´s audio into midi. I got it working with this tutorial: http://www.abletonop.com/2011/11/convert-audio-to-midi-within-live-for-infinite-possibilities/

My problem is the kind of midi message I get doing this. I guess the loopers multipurpose-button needs fast on-off message? Now when I push my looper pedal the looper goes into recording mode and immeddiately into play mode. How could I transform my sustain pedals audio signal into fast attack and decay without sustain?
