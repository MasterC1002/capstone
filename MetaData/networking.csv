One of the nicest and most talented network engineers I have had the privilege of working with -- a redditor, age 25, passed away this past Monday in a terrible car accident.


[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/v7p8f/the_next_few_months_of_my_life_unboxed_ready_to/) is a recent thread Brandon had here. He just finished this network and was already excited and thinking about finding new challenges. 


Brandon was extraordinarily talented for his age. He came to us at a time when we spent months looking for a new hire, both in Chicago and San Francisco. All in all one of the nicest human beings I have ever had the pleasure of interacting with.

A little history about myself

I am a 25 year old network professional. I started out at 18 working for a small multi-site company as part of a two-person IT department in a jack-of-all-trades role; although, you could say a high, in designing and supporting networks that meet business needs, big or small, and delivering success. Throughout my career I've had to learn many valuable lessons that I wish to share with you all.

I do not claim to be an expert in this field, and where challenges are abundant, as that is where you will thrive and learn the most. A lot of these lessons I'm about to talk about may not even be new to you, however, I want this to be an act of giving back to a community that has given so much [knowledge].

So in proceeding, Business, and Technical Skills.

**Social**

In order to be successful

Whether you are a CEO, you will at some point have to communicate with others, whether it be business, leisure, or personal matters, and if you want to be successful, regardless of industry

I grew up mostly introverted, after much self-reflection and practice, I am beginning to come to the realization that speaking to others does not have to be a nerve-wrecking ordeal. Success, personal or business, requires the skill of expressing your thoughts and ideas, building relationships and rapport with those around you, and using communication as another tool in your arsenal. Don't be afraid to express your thoughts, if you are genuine and speak with conviction, family, adapt to different environments

Be patient with people
Learn to respect others and be tolerant. 
Don't dwell on work related stress
Don't be afraid to fail
Don't ever lose sight of your goals and never

**Business**

Success in business begins with learning the right skills. These skills can be technical, and sometimes all three.

Technical skills get you in the door; social and business skills get you up the ladder.

Throughout my career I've noticed that aside from having technical skills, have objectives. Hone your technical skills and over time, if you've been challenged, you will learn what works and what does not; you will learn how to design networks based on best practices, develop processes, policies and procedures that work, and deliver services that your client will ultimately appreciate.

Learn to network with people, will open up doors to new opportunities, opportunities that will hopefully test you, frustrate and break you, challenge and teach you, and build character.

**Technical**

In networking

Technical certification exams can only teach you so much

I believe the most important thing you need to understand in becoming a masterful network engineer are PROTOCOLS. Learn how they behave, learn their history! I cannot stress this enough. LEARN. PROTOCOLS. Examples include the almighty TCP/IP protocol, arguably one of the most important protocols you should know inside-out as a network engineer. Once you understand the dynamics of these logical processes, you will develop, over time, through years of sweat, blood, the ability to troubleshoot complex challenges with ease, if you learn to understand

Learn to diagram! This is extremely important as an engineer. And I don't mean throwing together a willy-nilly diagram that no one but you can interpret. It will take time, your diagrams will get better, they will be organized, structured logically, and if you're good, allow you to communicate complex ideas with simplicity. Keep a notepad with you while you work or blank paper, sketching out your thoughts when solving issues or needing to understand something complex

Learn to document! Seriously, or a personal knowledgebase for yourself, this will only help! Personally, I've been using Evernote to do this. It is free, robust, and accessible. Often times while solving an issue I will take the time during and afterwards to note the symptoms of the issue, steps I took to troubleshoot and their result, and resources that aided me such as website links. And trust me, so document and save yourself some time!

Never be afraid to leave your comfort zone. 
Learn to think outside the box.
Strive to learn something new every day! Even one thing is progress!

**Conclusion**

IT is an amazing field to get into that can be incredibly fulfilling if you are willing to put in the work. As with any field, and truly have a passion for this, you can't go wrong. Some people will tell you networking is a dying field but that is so very, very wrong. The discipline of network engineering is a thriving one, and will be for some time. Networks are getting larger, demands for connectivity are growing, and competent, earn your keep

I apologize for the rant

Thanks!

My apologies if this is not the type of post you want on this reddit. 

Edit: [here is a layout of our current infrastructure.](http://imgur.com/Ex9vSxI)   There are two segments, they are running VTP, which in turn is being received by a vtp client on the 6905s, which pushes the vlans out to it's switches.  Everything works fine internally on the servers connected to the switches on the 7600 series router.  The problem is the servers connected behind the 6905s, they are not exchanging arps at all with servers on the other switches(4948s).

EDIT:
Another one of our admins is jumping on this thread

Hi
It looks likes a solution would be to add a VLAN interface on each core network with an IP address from the subnet assigned to that particular VLAN
Any thoughts?

IOS images.  They are different for everyone, unless I'm doing MLS.  I have an image for the 3740, but it always causes a problem with saving in GNS3.

**EDIT:  For everyone to get on the same page, for the 3600 series router I use the image c3640-jk9s-mz.124-16.  These are optional, but they're the images i have had the best performance with.  And finally, visit GNS3.net and pick up the [image unpacker.](http://gns3.net/download) use this to uncompress the IOS image.  It will load quicker, and when we have 10 routers in the topology and you (accidentally / purposefully) hit the play button it won't kill your computer.**  We won't be using the 7200 series routers, but I might be able to give a small class later on that specific platform later if I have time.

1341265350.0,vy1ha,Subnetting - The easy way,Netadmin44,99,21,57,"This is my little guide for subnetting (IPV4)

Lets get started!

Why?

Let's say we both want an Orange (ip addresses) and one whole Orange is worth 100 addresses. Well get to the math later...

I only need 10/100 for my store

This is the idea of subnetting. It's taking a fraction of a whole to allow more people to be able to use them.

This is a game, and win the game.

numbering rules.

Every time I subnet I write this down on a piece of paper. ALWAYS.

* Subnet (/is slash) 24     25     26    27     28    29   30  31  32
* Host amount (#) 256   128     64    32     16    8     4    2   1 

* /24 matches with 256 hosts
* /25 matches with 128 hosts
* /26 matches with 64 hosts
* /27 matches with 32 hosts
* /28 matches with 16 hosts
* /29 matches with 8 hosts
* /30 matches with 4 hosts
* /31 matches with 2 hosts
* /32 matches with 1 host

*This is the last octet - Octet = 8 bits that make up your address.*

192.168.xxx.xxx That is the most familiar.

Each number set is equal to 8 bits

xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxx.

We are starting with the last octet

We will start with 192.168.0.0 This is our network address. On your router at home
We never use the network address. 
We use the first available address which is 192.168.0.1

Lets say you have 2 computers, a PS3, and your phone at home to connect to your network. You need a total of 6 hosts. 6 addresses need to be allocated to your network so that you can have an address for each host.

Well do this

* PC1 = 192.168.0.1
* PC2 = 192.168.0.2
* PS3 = 192.168.0.3
* XB  = 192.168.0.4
* Ipad= 192.168.0.5
* Ph  = 192.168.0.6
                                     
Is there really a need to sue 200+ addresses for 6 hosts? No.

So looking above at the chart I poorly made

Key - Whenever you have your # of hosts - add 2 - One address for the network address

Have 13486 hosts? better make that 1348**8** because you always add 2 to make the network address work.

So our starting address is 192.68.0.0 /29 becasue we need 6 hosts+2 for network and broadcast.

We know where the network starts AND ends now.

* Start - 192.168.0.0 /29
* Ends - 192.168.0.8 (this is where the next address begins)

* First Usable Address - 192.168.0.1
* Last usable Address - 192.168.0.6



* I always make it look like this
* N0 (Network Zer0)                               - 192.168.0.0
* F0 (First usable for network Zer0)           - 192.168.0.1
* L0 (Last Usable for network Zer0)           - 192.168.0.6
* BC0 (Broadcast address for network Zer0)-192.168.0.7
* N1(This is where the next network Network1 Starts) - 192.168.0.8

* So -

* N0 - 192.168.0.0 /29
* F0 - 192.168.0.1
* L0 - 192.168.0.6
* BC - 192.168.0.7
* N1 - 192.168.0.8

Not only did I allocate exactly the amount of spaces needed

(Another best practice is to bump up to the next available, but I dont have any available. Dam. Should have made it a /28 just in case.

* Re-Do

* N0 - 192.168.0.0 /28 (so 16 addresses are allowed now)
* F0 - 192.168.0.1
* L0 - 192.168.0.14
* BC - 192.168.0.15
* (Next Network)
* N1 - 192.168.0.16

This will ease up some space in case I go nuts with electronics.

I hope this has helped someone. If anyone has q's or comments feel free.

    Hash: SHA1

Advisory — D-root is changing its IPv4 address on the 3rd of January.


This is advance notice that there is a scheduled change to the IPv4
address for one of the authorities listed for the DNS root zone and
the .ARPA TLD. The change is to D.ROOT-SERVERS.NET
administered by the University of Maryland.

The new IPv4 address for this authority is 199.7.91.13

The current IPv6 address for this authority is  2001:500:2d::d and it
will continue to remain unchanged.

This change is anticipated to be implemented in the root zone on 3
January 2013
will replace the previous IP address of 128.8.10.90 (also once known
as TERP.UMD.EDU).

We encourage operators of DNS infrastructure to update any references
to the old IP address
particular
should be updated with the new IP address.

New hints files will be available at the following URLs once the
change has been formally executed:

http://www.internic.net/domain/named.root

http://www.internic.net/domain/named.cache

The old address will continue to work for at least six months after
the transition

The Juniper SIRT is not aware of any malicious exploitation of this vulnerability. 

This issue only affects devices running Junos OS 7.6R1 and later. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue. 

Solution: 
All Junos OS software releases built on or after 2013-01-17 have fixed this specific issue. Releases containing the fix specifically include: 10.4S12, 12.1R4-S3, 12.1R5, 12.2R2-S2, 12.2R3, 12.3R1, and all subsequent releases (i.e. all releases built after 12.3R1). In addition

Customers can confirm the build date of any Junos OS release by issuing the command 'show version detail'. 

This issue is being tracked as PR 839412 and is visible on the Customer Support website. 

KB16765 - ""In which releases are vulnerabilities fixed?"" describes which release vulnerabilities are fixed as per our End of Engineering and End of Life support policies. 

Workarounds 
The impact of the specially crafted TCP packet successfully making it's way to a listening port on the RE is a kernel crash and switchover (or reboot on single RE systems). 

Standard security best common practices (BCPs) can be employed, TTL security mechanisms to significantly reduce the risk of malicious exploit by limiting access to the router only from valid, trusted hosts. Features like uRPF and TTL Security (see sample macro below), or simply applying input firewall filters at the peering interfaces which discard traffic sourced from internal prefixes, will aid customers in protecting their network from remote attacks relying on spoofed source addresses. Note that while it's possible to use source routing to bypass uRPF, source routing is disabled by default in all recent Junos releases.

Solution Implementation: 
How to obtain fixed software: 

Security vulnerabilities in Junos are fixed in the next available Maintenance Release of each supported Junos version. In some cases, customers will be provided download instructions for a Service Release. Although Juniper does not provide formal Release Note documentation for a Service Release, a list of ""PRs fixed"" can be provided on request.

I wanted to ask

I admit I dont have a clue about layers 5

My basic understanding is that networks operate by first sending coded electrical impulses through the physical media (layer 1) device to device through the use of frames. Embedded in these frames are the source and destination MAC addresses that tell each device where each frame came from, and the routers try to find a path to send the frame along to another device to get it closer to its destination IP(Layer 3). They then overwrite the original source and destination MAC addresses and continue on sending the packets to different devices (again Layer 2). and then there's something about ports.. and then it all becomes fuzzy.
 
I won't even pretend to understand anything about or above 4. and I'm pretty sure that there's a lot of stuff that overlaps (like how routers have to overwrite the layer 2 MACs by examining layer 3 packets) on other layers that I probably do not understand or have caught on to yet. I originally thought the model was very static but after learning about that i understood that it can be a bit more complicated than that.

In the last 18 hours I made an unauthorised change to our enterprise network

Ok so some backstory... I am responsible for about half of the networks in my region (asia pacific). We are about to roll out a new voice network in our Sydney office. This is to enable SIP connectivity from our aging Alcatel PBX to the global Avaya system in Singapore. So I had an ip address range assigned to our site (a /21

I have a change request logged for next weekend to actually move the PBX to the new network. I thought I'd save time by having a few pieces in place before we started.

Turns out that was a bad idea... The first /25 we were assigned was already in use in our Japan office. And as OSPF worked its magic

I knocked out their system for about 8 hours.

And of course now questions are being asked as to why a change request was not logged and approved beforehand.
I'm not too worried at this point. My Boss and his boss are pretty reasonable people. Maybe I get written up with a warning. I guess I deserve that.

So this is just a cautionary tale. Don't even do the changes you see as zero impact without logging a change request if it's in a production system.

Don't trust what other people tell you about network topology. If I'd looked at our routing table before implementing the interface I would have seen the network already existed. Instead I took their word for it that the range assigned was free.

With all the talk of bgp on here being a bit scary on here I propose we start a BGP learning environment.

Basically we start a private reddit peering network. Like something in spirit of https://dn42.net/.

The idea is people setup a home router either cisco, juniper etc and connect up to one another over gre tunnels then bgp peer using a private AS number and advertise a /24. In the process we can teach one another about BGP and other technologies. Also the darknet people may be interested.

The vyatta and qugga solutions are easy as they are free and can be run in a VM.

So the people of Iran can only rely on proxy's and VPN to surf the web hassle free, the average delay to facebook with VPN connected to Germany, Sweden, UK, and US is about 300ms, each of them, imagine what TOR would be like.

In Iran

Since Proxy/socks5v/PPTP/OpenVPn/L2TP/SSH/HTTPS is using encryption

UDP or TCP or using uncommon ports wont make any difference.

I've tried OpenVPN with certificates, and tried without cert files, and using pre-shared key, both TCP and UDP, same port. Did not connect.

TOR Obfsproxy is not an option.

*Hardware*

30x Dell Force10 S55 1 GigE switches with a single 10 GigE module.

2x Dell Force10 S4810 10 GigE switches.

A single S55 per rack with 2x 10 Gig ports connected to the S4810s. (the S4810s are stacked).

Does this make sense? Everything is on a single subnet as there's pretty little traffic as is.

The site: A big campus network with around 900 increasingly elderly Cisco switches. 10/100 to the desk with Gigabit uplinks between the switches. Traditional core/dist/access model with first-hop routing happening at the distribution layer and layer 3 between core and dist. We're not doing anything particularly clever; it's all IPv4 running OSPF with lots and lots of VLANs.

We need to replace pretty much everything as a) we want Gigabit to the desk and 10Gig core/dist, 802.1x) with dynamic VLAN assignment to simplify moves/adds/changes.

Cisco has a great story for where we can go from here but it's eye-wateringly expensive, we all know IOS very well and are very comfortable with it.

Juniper also has a great story that is both more straightforward

I'm in charge of a project to get the housing cooperative I live in hooked up to a fiber line

I've come pretty far in the process

There's one thing I'm not sure about

The offer I've received suggests Cat 5E, I'm hoping we will exceed that within the next decade or two. Almost the entire cost of getting everything set up is in wiring the apartments. It's around 3300 DKK per apartment (~$500), and I'm thinking it may be wise to chose a cabling rated for 10 Gbit, now that we're at it anyway.

At the same time I know how fast technological progress is, or because we will have figured out a way to push 10 Gbit through a Cat 5E cable by then.

As far as I can see, [it won't cost more than $65 bucks for 50 meters of Cat 6A cabling or so \(at most\)](http://www.discount-low-voltage.com/Cable/Cat6A-Ethernet-Cable/6UA124UTP-11W), which isn't much when compared to the total cost of around $500 per apartment.

I'm interested in getting some input on this though. What are your thoughts? Is it a no-brainer to go with Cat 6A

I'm purposefully ignoring fiber cabling for the apartments as this will require a box in each apartment that converts the optical signal to an electrical Ethernet signal

Earth shattering results? Not so much in my opinion. 802.11n 5GHz 40MHz can provide some excellent results and is quite stable. AC over the long term will get us closer to cutting the cord

* Genuine interest in technology and computing (its not about the money)
* Committing yourself to **never stop learning**
* A realization that it is a long
* Patience

So you've got those

1.  **Go to College:** Some people skip this step

2.  **Get a Helpdesk Job:** Everyone starts in Helpdesk. This is where you gain a lot of confidence, and most importantly: your first battle scars.  You need to find out the hard way that you don't know everything by causing a massive fuck up.  It humbles you and makes you more conscious of what you're doing and how it can impact things.  While you're working help desk, try to help out your superiors in any way possible.  Also, you should be working on getting at least your Network+ and CCNA.  Why Net+?  It's a really well rounded certification that covers a lot of ideas that are very vendor neutral.

At this point you have two options.  Stick around at your current company or jump ship.  I would say jump ship

3.  **Junior Administrator:** Why an administrator?  You want to be in networking?  You need server experience.  The more knowledgeable about servers you are, and companies will typically give old stuff away. 

4.  **Junior Network Engineer:** This title has many names, you should have enough experience/knowledge to get your CCNP.  The company should be able to pay for it too.  

Once you have your CCNP

One thing you'll eventually need to think about is what specialty you'll bring into the table/focus on.  I think Cisco breaks it down the best:

* Routing and Switching
* Voice/Unified Communications
* Security
* Wireless
* Storage and data center

Because of the router age(s)

**Official Requirements**

 * WAN is only a single &lt;100Mbps Fiber line. We're investigating bringing in additional fiber lines for redundancy (this has been done previous-- before my time here).
 * BGP is configured. We have a decent allocation of IPv4 addresses from ARIN.
 * Traffic is relatively low (less than 15Mbps before Feburary
 * We'd prefer having redundant  hardware available (either in a fall-over configuration or manual switchover). Redundant power is good as well.
 * The 72xx only had 512MB of Memory (Max supported by the NPE)
 * Network Layout is very simple. Theoretically

**Unofficial Desires**

* IPv6. Enough Said?
* Internal BGP/OSPF/RIP/Something. Everything is currently 'static' or with this router as the gateway (several dozen addresses). Unfortunately
* Up-to-date firmware.

**About Us**

So

I'm sure we like telling our clients that our network runs on a Cisco routers. 

We're mostly a Linux shop-- with several Windows servers as well. We just switched our internal router to some Vyatta-based hardware (I have previous experience with Vyatta

Our team is pretty good at picking things up. 

Ultimately

**Questions**

I'm not familiar with all of the available routers and series-- especially once you start including EOL models. Is 73xx a good bang for the buck? Should I push for some 72xx NPE upgrades instead? Or is there another vendor/model we should consider? 

I'm unsure of all the active redundancy options available on the routers. Memory is a slight concern as well. The BGP tables of this router were getting quite large and I was pretty hesitant to add dynamic routing, both fibers to both routers, or something else?

**tl;dr**

Supervisor/Boss is cheap. We need one or more edge-like router(s) that can utilize:

* Full BGP (with multiple fiber lines
* Internal dynamic routing (currently unimplemented)
* IPv6 (not on the official agenda).

1349809817.0,117k02,Is it possible to split a 1 Gbit Internet connection *equally* between 200 people?,runeks,46,5,48,"Hello /r/networking 

I'm in the process of finding out how to establish a common internet infrastructure that is shared between the tenants of the two apartment buildings that are part of the housing cooperative I live in.

So far the propositions we have received all suggest that we get a ~~1 Gbit~~ (**EDIT:**) 10 Gbit fiber connection into the basement of one of the apartment buildings, will enter each apartment.

One difference between the various propositions is that some recommend we simply share the entire ~~1 Gbit~~ (**EDIT:**) 10 Gbit between all tenants

Discussing the choice between these two choices, for example, seed torrents at full speed on my current connection, without limiting the speed greatly, mainly because of buffers at my ISP. They will get filled up with outgoing data, and the subsequent requests I send will go to the back of the queue, and my response time will be high. It's all explained here: http://www.bufferbloat.net/

Is this applicable to the solution that I'm seeking

Some background on the island: there is currently no wired phone or Internet service.  There is no power link with the mainland; most houses and businesses on the island only have power each night when they run their generators from around 6 to 10pm.  I'm not worried about powering the equipment during the day

The big question is the Internet service itself.  Clearly the only answer is satellite service.  However

Does anyone have any information or recommendations on satellite Internet services that would be available in SE Asia?  I'm less worried about overall bandwidth and more worried about transfer caps -- for tourists we will use heavy QoS restrictions to cap each connection at a certain speed, which would be the #3 reason for tourists to use the service after email and Facebook in general), and a few hundred tourists a week uploading some pics here or there may hit the cap pretty quickly.

I'm kind of disappointed because in the US, and at that price we wouldn't mind paying for multiple accounts and using them in unison or just switching over when one hits the cap.  But I'm fairly sure those services aren't available worldwide. :(

So

**edit:** Some good information here, with a dozen or so huts on it.  We aren't going to wire huts because they are huts and no one has computers or will likely ever be able to afford them.  We don't need our own IP space, we don't need to be a set up like an ISP.  If you've never been to remote SE Asia then you probably have no concept as to the squalor that we are talking about, and how overboard some of these solutions sound.

We need something for locals to learn what email is and use it to contact family members off-island.  We need something for tourists (read: backpackers) that will be sufficient for eight or so terminals to be accessing pretty much only Facebook, nor are there more communities on the island for this to spread to.  In fact, the government is scheduled to bulldoze everything in 6-8 years to turn the island into a resort destination.

Doing the math


Regular Ethernet (non-802.1Q or jumbo frames) was used, and TCP using another 16 Bytes.


Ethernet - 38

IPv4/IPv6 - 16/36

TCP - 16 (at minimum


Maximum Ethernet Frame size - 1538 Bytes (Includes the framing as 1500 Bytes is encapsulated by the frame.


IPv4 total overhead - 70 Bytes

IPv6 total overhead - 90 Bytes

    DISCUSSION
    
       Twas the night before start-up and all through the net
         not a packet was moving; no bit nor octet.
       The engineers rattled their cards in despair
         hoping a bad chip would blow with a flare.
       The salesmen were nestled all snug in their beds
         while visions of data nets danced in their heads.
       And I with my datascope tracings and dumps
         prepared for some pretty bad bruises and lumps.
       When out in the hall there arose such a clatter
         I sprang from my desk to see what was the matter.
    
       There stood at the threshold with PC in tow
         An ARPANET hacker
       I could see from the creases that covered his brow
         he'd conquer the crisis confronting him now.
       More rapid than eagles
         and scrutinized each for its potential harm.
    
       On LAPB
         TCP
    
       His eyes were afire with the strength of his gaze;
         no bug could hide long; not for hours or days.
       A wink of his eye and a twitch of his head
         soon gave me to know I had little to dread.
       He spoke not a word
         fixing a net that had gone plumb berserk;
       And laying a finger on one suspect line
         he entered a patch and the net came up fine!
    
       The packets flowed neatly and protocols matched;
         the hosts interfaced and shift-registers latched.
       He tested the system from Gateway to PAD;
         not one bit was dropped; no checksum was bad.
       At last he was finished and wearily sighed
    
    
    
    Cerf                                                            [Page 1]

    Twas the Night Before Start-up
    
    
         and turned to explain why the system had died.
       I twisted my fingers and counted to ten;
         an off-by-one index had done it again...

My problem is that I'm running an AD DHCP/DNS server (which is configured fine and working well). I checked the DNS cache in the router and the settings are fine. 

However, but does not give it the correct DNS setting. It just gives it 127.0.0.1. Nslookup shows the same info with server name unknown. 

If I let the server assign the dhcp address and then statically assign the dns address, these things should work on their own. So, what am I doing wrong?

A customer called in complaining that after moving a device from a different network segment it no longer worked. As this device in particular controlled the environmental control system it was a fairly critical piece of equipment to get working. The change request was processed and kicked back to us citing end-user error/CPE as the root cause. This particular end user was quite adamant his equipment was fine and was just inspected so I dug in a little bit [some output cut]:

    interface FastEthernet1/0/10 
    switchport access vlan 300 
    switchport mode access  
    spanning-tree portfast 
    spanning-tree bpduguard enable 
    spanning-tree guard root 
    end

Well, not the core switch, the local switch, nothing.

I had the thought to check the uplink port and found the culprit:

    interface GigabitEthernet1/0/1 
    description uplink port from switch 
    switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q 
    switchport trunk native vlan 100 
    switchport trunk allowed vlan 100
    switchport mode trunk 
    switchport nonegotiate 
    end

vlan 300 wasn’t trunked through the uplink port.

“An easy fix!” I thought as I

    ClientSwitch(config)#interface gi1/0/1
    ClientSwitch(config-if)#switchport trunk allowed vlan 300

The switch dropped

“Perhaps it’s just STP convergence or my local session locked up.” I thought to myself as adrenaline started coursing its way though my veins. I opened a second terminal and tried to ping the switch.

Nothing.

I got on the phone with our local contact at the site and

After a bit of research and a quick trip to the lab

    switchport trunk allowed vlan add 300

At the end of the day everything was working

Specifically we were talking about something I wanted to try (meshing of MPLS-TE tunnels) using the auto-tunnel mesh functionality in Cisco and dynamic tunnels RSVP-TE within Juniper. He disagreed with me on using those and instead was pushing for more of an external means of setting those up (using scripts). Another one that came up was using the auto-bandwidth functionality for TE tunnels. One could use the router to make changes to the bandwidth statement or one could write a script that parses that information and manually sets the bandwidth. 

Either way, if that feature was put in there and kept in there then it must be worth some good right? On top of that....not everyone (myself) really knows how to do scripting. That's not to say I can't learn (I want to start doing ""Python the hard way"") but I guess I don't know where the line is. Trust routers to dynamically manage themselves (within reason) or write scripts that are vendor agnostic to dynamically manage them.

To me things such as auto-tunnel mesh/dynamic tunnels RSVP-TE seems like a wonderful little piece of software. Auto-bandwidth seems like a wonderful piece of software. For those to not work would require either a bug or for 100% CPU to kick off.

I'm confident enough in my own networking experience to set up the building. I'm just not sure about the kind of Internet connection we'll need. Comcast business isn't going to work - they don't let you ""re-sell"" the connection like this. (Makes sense

My first question is how much bandwidth will we need? I want to be able to call the connection ""up to 10 Mbps"". The apartments are being marketed to young people so we expect a lot of video traffic, but we also don't want to pay too much.

Speaking of money, so I'll wait for other quotes. I have quote requests with Cogent, the phone company, and Comcast's ""dedicated Internet"" service (which apparently doesn't have the same restrictions as business class.)

- ROUTE then SWITCH and then TSHOOT.  TSHOOT builds on both ROUTE and SWITCH

- Try to get them done close together.  With TSHOOT, the better.  (Though I'll admit, TSHOOT is pretty much my job, so it made it the seemingly easiest of the three).

- Do labs!  If you don't have access to a production network build a lab, Google is your friend: *intitle:index.of ios parent directory bin*

- If you have access to a production network, or complex OSPF topology in action will allow you to wrap your heard around them more.  Heck, TSHOOT is pretty much ""Know your _show_ commands.""

- Do not study the day of the test, with me cramming right before the test raises stress levels, but not help retention.  So cramming right before the exam may do more harm then good.

- During the test: be calm, think, answer, move on.  The clock isn't your biggest enemy, you are your biggest enemy.  There is more then enough time to answer all the questions on all three tests.  If you over think something, it will bite you in the ass.  If you keep second guessing yourself, it will bite you in your ass.  Don't chew up your clock on a question you don't know and end up running out of time to answer the questions you do know.  Read (at least twice), answer

My current place of employ is looking to upgrade our ""core"" switching infrastructure (and I use the term lightly) because the existing units (3750-X's) have simply run out of expandability for 10 gig ports (2 per switch

Ideally, this had been decreed as ""too expensive"" (and, admittedly, it is!), so I'm looking at alternatives.

I've ruled out other Cisco chassis based switches (6500 or 4500) because finding a high density 10 gig card which *isn't* oversubscribed to the backplane is impossible

Juniper offers either the EX-4500 series of the QFX3500 series which would fit the bill

I've never looked at

Basic requirements (apart from high 1/10 gig density in a 1RU switch, obviously standard layer 2 features like VLAN's, LACP (port channel or LAG or whatever HP calls it).

Does anyone have some experience with these HP switches who is willing to provide some insight into the management/configuration compared to Cisco's (or Juniper's) interface? Are they similar? Radically different? A complete pain in the arse?

What about reliability/interoperability? I'll be hanging Cisco access switches off the HP's if I get them - does HP support the equivalent of Cisco's VPC (or Juniper's MC-LAG)

I seem to have got my answer. Correct me if I am wrong.

In a layer2 environment *all* multicast traffic is *always* forwarded to the ""mrouter"" (The mrouter can in this case be a PIM service or simply just an IGMP querier running on a switch). This means that if a switch has its mrouter on port Ge0/23 and gets multicast from Ge0/1-Ge0/22 it would always forward it to Ge0/23 because the ""mrouter"" is there

Remember that we are not talking about multicast routing here. We're talking about how the multicast behaves across switches that are in the same broadcast domain.

Original post:

Spent the whole night yesterday setting the following up with me going home unhappy at 9am. Would appreciate if you guys can take a look at the diagram and perhaps see if there are any problems with it.

http://i.imgur.com/CUs8bpR.png

The main question I have is how the PIM service (which sends IGMP queries) behaves in this scenario

Since the first switch has &gt; 2G multicast traffic being input to the switch

The client stationary computer in this diagram was able to receive multicast video which was VERY choppy.

Regards


EDIT:

To answer all;
I am only multicasting locally

I know for a certain that traffic will never be close to 1G between the Cisco 2970 and the EX3300. Therefore currently I have only 1 cable between them. I have however left one port unused for LACP.

This diagram is using the PIM-SM (default?) and the EX3300 has an ip of 10.100.0.2 (This should be the RP IP?).


NOTE: The multicast sources at the bottom left of the diagram is sending hundreds of multicast addresses each and at no point do I expect the sum of listeners connected to the juniper to increase over 1G (Though I have left 1 extra cable unplugged for LACP if that would be the case).

Let me rephrase the question a little bit;
How would this need to be configured that in the scenario where there are 0 listeners to the multicast addresses would there be no load between the first cisco 2970 and the EX3300 (GE-0/0/0 and Ge0/1)?",,t5_2qkaf,1366290339.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1cjbh9/multicast_network_diagram_do_you_see_any_issues/

Currently, sonar, radar and some other tidbits and copies that to an external hard drive and then put on a helicopter and flown back to the analysis station 75 miles away.  The problem here is that this is slow and expensive and not to mention that within the time the data is being transported back to land, new and more relevant data may come up.  

I have been looking at Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN) that NASA's JPL has been experimenting with for inter-planetary communication.  This is similar to how the Mar's rovers have been sending data streams back to Earth.  Unfortunately, radiation and other cosmic phenomenons that can cause packet loss or corruption.  Another idea was to use lasers/optical/light based means of sending data packets, but there are other issues like the microwave communications that can cause data loss as well such as humidity, line of site, etc.  Light based is fast however and in laboratory experiments can get up to 500Mbits/s and latency is very low (speed of light and decoding light pulses) and can be compared to current fiber optic networks - minus the fiber.

I did look at Satellite internet which is commonly used for cruise ships and navel ships

The idea I had was to develop floating pods that use a combination of Wifi (802.11ac @ 5Ghz), solar power and basic propulsion.  The Wifi would be setup in a bridge/repeater mode with can-tenna type directional focus to shuttle data from the ship to other pods and back to land.  The microcontrollers would tie into the GPS and propulsion and adjust to keep it in a relatively static location.  Also, this could be used to dynamically adjust all the pods to move according to the ship if it is moving too.  The solar panels will power the entire thing, but also have an onboard battery.  Lastly, I would include a 512MB (or more) onboard cache to hold data packets just in case a pod goes MIA.

This is just a lunch time napkin idea I sketched out while out with my program manager.  He and our client like the idea

1367511639.0,1dk3zw,I have a couple of Cisco 2811's that need config changes. Got a quote for the job. Wondering if the price was fair or if I'm being snookered.,allthe_IT_hats,30,3,52,"What is it we have two 2811 routers that connect our two site over a T1 P2P. There are two T1's. Half of one T1 is used for our PBX Option 11 to provide phone service and the left over is used for Data. We are wanting to switch to an 8 meg connection via a fiber P2P. The issue is we need someone that can configure the two routers to maintain the connection to the PBX so we still have phones at the remote location. 

I asked a few local companies to quote us out the job and so far one has replied with a quote of $1600 for the work. $400 of that is to recover the password to the devices. I am not Cisco savy and am not afraid to admit it. That is why I ask you guys if that seems a bit steep for the work required? Or am I just being cheap?   

I know this will be asked: The reason the password is unknown is due to an admin that left the company and I have been thrown into fill everything that was his duties since we will not fill the position. 

EDIT: Thanks for all the feedback. And to answer a few questions: As far as the phones connecting between sites I should have mentioned there is an ADTRAN on each end that connects to the PBX to give it the ""T1"" connection it needs and is connected by a v35 serial cable. 
Once this is finished I will sleep better knowing the configs are backed up and the password is safe in my secret password keeping spot.

Each is connected to the Internet with cheap DSL connections.

They're starting to share internal resources.  VPN's are starting to pop up and worse

So

Here's my thinking right now:

Assign each office a Class-C address and put them on a /23 subnet to open up the number of DHCP assigned IP's.

Organize them nicely so that if an external company ever wants to create a VPN with us
10.100.0.0 = site1

I've never tweaked an SPF timer in my life.  I'm accustomed to the Junos behavior, if needed (like more LSAs come in during the SPF calc), the router will do back-to-back SPF recalcs (default is 3).  After 3 back-to-back runs, a hold-timer applies until the next set of back-to-back runs (default is 5000ms).  I've done plenty of Cisco interop in very large networks, and never tweaked the timers on either side for IGP use.

Those defaults have never failed to provide fast

Further, increasing the up timer as the number of link flaps increases, up to a defined max timer value - correct?

If determinism is your goal, and then implement an interface hold time with a short down interval, and an up interval longer than that max IGP convergence time..

1363204858.0,1a8itz,Moving from unmanaged dedicated hosting to colocation - advice on &gt;100Mbps connectivity,ixforres,29,3,34,"I'm running a fairly hefty site (an imageboard) in terms of bandwidth and server resources. Currently it's hosted on a couple of high-end OVH boxes but as you'd expect from a cheap provider, they've either gone ""We can't provide that"" or given me a laughably high number.

I'm still getting my head around networking but it seems like I should be able to arrange a 1Gig physical/~200Mbps soft-limited connection for less than £1500 a month. The site doesn't make much money (it's donation-supported and doesn't quite break even) so vastly expensive options are out of scope. Should I be looking at moving to my own routing platform and peering higher up the food chain than directly with a colocation provider?

I'd love to hear any stories from people who have done a similar move or have experience of pushing this much data around on a budget.

As I mentioned I'm quite new to enterprise/high-level networking; I've been working on web-facing servers and internal systems for about 6 years now but my experience with BGP and the business side of this sort of operation is lacking - any resources for finding out more would be appreciated!

So, they seem to have done a pretty decent job implementing an ASR1k in a VM.  Their licensing model doesn't seem the most user friendly, and the thing is limited to 50M of throughput (2.5M for me, without any license key), but in my case, who cares?  For a quick &amp; dirty lab, 2.5M is more than sufficient.

So, P/PE - 3 vSRX, 1 CSR.  The CEs are the remaining 2 vSRX.  The core is the classic ""box with X"" topology, and the CEs are dual homed.  It took me about an hour to spin up the VMs and get the configs knocked out.  Long story short - it all worked fine, despite my fingers continued effort to type ""commit"" on the CSR. :)

The process of bringing the VM online was straight forward.  You deploy a new OVF, default route, switch on ssh, make a user account, etc.  Still terribly disappointed to see Cisco's lack of ability to use a bit-based netmask, still forcing dotted decimal format.  At least the form for VM provisioning accepts CIDR notation.

Overall

Final point - it's a total resource hog.  If you take VMware's default of ""thick provisioning"" for the disk, the RAM.. Good grief, the RAM.  Sitting idle, 1 CSR is consuming 2.8G of RAM, with 4GB provisioned.  To put that in perspective, a vSRX provisions 1GB of RAM and I've pumped a lot more than 50M through one.",,,,
1369335151.0,1ex4ih,Any Wireshark gurus here? I'm having some trouble with throughput measurement.,noodhoog,29,5,17,"I've been doing some throughput testing

To give a simple example of what I'm talking about, connected with a crossover. I've got iperf running on them, and it tells me that it's happily pushing TCP traffic between them at a consistent rate of around 907477 Kbits, or ~886 Mbits

What I'm finding though is if during this process I take a capture of the iperf traffic and view the throughput from Wireshark, the average throughput rate is dramatically lower than expected. In the case of my 886 Mb/s iperf traffic, Wireshark tells me that average bps for the TCP conversation was 91983982, or about 87.7 Mbps, roughly off by a factor of 10, which makes me think it could be a conversion issue, but if so I don't see where it's creeping in, I've tried to be careful about that.

The same happens if I use speedtest.net or an HTTP file transfer, though not always by a factor of 10. It could be that my capture station is just too slow to catch everything, but I'm not seeing Wireshark complain about missing packets.

I'd appreciate any insight on this

Edit: Ugh, and for some reason Wireshark wasn't flagging it. I found a whole bunch of missing seq's which I wasn't initially seeing - in fact, I think they were getting filtered out of the packet list for some reason, which is weird, as I had no capture/display filter in place, but at least I see 'em now. Now I just need to find a box fast enough to snarf up these packets at line speed.

I decided to give Solarwind's NTA a chance and configured 3 of my core firewalls to export NetFlow data to it. In doing so

After both dashboards were up, I would get [this.](http://i.imgur.com/CqWvPpW.jpg) No data. Not wanting to spend too much time figuring out why, I decided to reboot the server -- once up, everything was fine... for a couple minutes until it would stop working. 

I decide to call Solarwinds support and after a few minutes of a remote session the technician tells me it's because of a license mismatch between NPM and NTA.

I have a 250 interface license for NPM, while adequate for the time being, still gets used fast. At the same time, a 100 device license for NetFlow is much more than we need. There just aren't that many devices in our network that we would need NetFlow data from.

After digging through a log file for a minute or two

    ERROR SolarWinds.Orion.NetFlow.LicenseManager - Orion components count:250
    ERROR SolarWinds.Orion.Common.SWEventLogging - License limitation doesn't fit orion license!
    INFO  SolarWinds.Orion.Common.SWEventLogging - NetFlow Receiver Service flow processing is suspended due to licensing issues.

So I guess if you don't have a matching license count between these two products

Doesn't make much sense to me...

They even neglected to mention this to us when we recently upgraded the NPM license from 100 interfaces to 250

I will talk to my account manager but even if they were to rectify the problem I couldn't see myself supporting a company that does business like this. Many of you know their products and support don't come cheap.

connection over a congested network. The congestion causes 
timeouts to occur and consequently for some packets to be resent. 
When they are finished communicating the two programs close the 
connection.**

**At some point in the future the client wishes to communicate once 
again with the server. The client's TCP layer initiates the connection 
by sending a SYN segment to the server's TCP layer. However
time due to congestion the segment is discarded at a congested 
router. At this point a duplicate SYN ACK segment from the first 
conversation is received by the client's TCP layer. How will the client's 
TCP layer interpret this segment**

Am I correct in saying that the client will reject the SYN ACK segment as it does not correspond to the sequence number of the most recent connection request (SYN) ?

Some folks wanted an update so here goes:

I had the interview and found out shortly later that I didn't get the job. 

The interview was short (26 mins) and covered rudimentary topics. I found it difficult to build rapport with the interviewer because presumably they interview a lot of candidates. I got off to a rocky start when I was asked about subnetting, I felt like I wasn't properly tested and that I didn't get a fair shot, I was answering the questions on their list, and they were dealing with binary- correct or incorrect. This is contrary to what you'd imagine, that they should be looking for your thought process when answering. While the interviewer had set questions I don't think they posed them properly, I started to answer some and had to look for qualifications to the scenarios only to find they had changed or big aspects had been left out. I put in serious hours preparing for the interview (must of which was not covered, at least it makes me a better network engineer). I was generally happy that I answered to the best of my ability

I work for a major US University and one of the things that my department does is DMCA processing for complaints that come in from copyright holders.  They give us an IP, and file name and we then match that IP to our DHCP records to find out the MAC registered to that IP at that time.  We have a DHCP registration system to use our network that ties the MAC to a user.  We then notify the user and pass on the complaint and depending on the severity, we either give a slap on the wrist or we block the user.  It usually they have an open router, a virus, or they were actually doing the file sharing.   We do not monitor for file sharing. That’s the back story.


Here is the issue I am running in to.  We have been getting a lot of smart phone flagged for DMCA complaints and I am having some trouble coming up with how this is happening.  It’s a wide range of phones too, but the fact that it’s over so many different phones makes that hard to believe. 


There are some people here at work that are throwing around the idea that it is because of tethering.  But I have told them that when you tether it goes through the cell network and not our campus network.  So now they are saying it must be some type of app that turns there phone in to a hotspot to connect to the campus Wi-Fi.  This would then allow other people to connect to the phone and would get the person who owns the phone a complaint.  I told them that this does not make much sense, for example: The.New.Movie.2011.DVDSCR.XVID.Une-CM8.  


I have also considered that someone is MAC spoofing the smartphones

First, and they basically gave me the freedom to try whatever I want as long as it fits the school budget. So why haven't I done it yet? I know next to nothing on network management.

Don't get me wrong, client side programming, etc.). When it comes to networking, all I know is how to set up a router for my phone. The IT guy here at the school doesn't know much more than what he set up here either (The school doesn't have its own server, just a bunch of small, separate routers scattered around the campus).

The college has about 90 students

I really wanna help them out here and am willing to learn for whatever amount of days next to my studies in order to do so. Money isn't much of an issue either since I can work with the school's promotion team led by my mother.

So can anyone direct me on any places online where I can start learning and getting started on this? So I can plan it all out and make cost estimates?

1367374506.0,1dgert,seeking firewall implementation advice,sheinballs,23,2,20,"I have a large open network and am looking into adding a firewall in the mix. I was hoping to get some advice from some of you in the trenches. I'm really looking for high-level advice on best ways to implement this in terms of minimizing problems (mostly technical

 Current environment:

- 1 core router (LOTS OF switch ports in-use here)
- 13 data closets connected via fiber to that core
- vlans utilized for breaking up broadcast domains
- servers connected directly to many of the core router switch ports
- basic ACLs to block common ports from the internet coming into the network 
- clients get a global IPv4 / v6 

Goals:

- have all vlans segregated and organized into different zones (re-classified into usage)
- servers in a tightly controlled DMZ
- implementation to roll out in stages to different pieces of the network
- MINIMIZE downtime! This isn't a start from scratch scenario. I need to tack this on in stages with limited resources in a production environment :)

Conceptually I'm having issues grasping the best way to put a firewall in place logistically and follow ""best"" security practices. I'm concerned with having all these vlans mixing on the core router before they touch the firewall. 

Potential design #1:

- remove the core router's ip interfaces on the vlans
- trunk those vlans into the firewall. make the firewall the default gateway for clients on the vlans 
- have a /30 between the firewall / core router for communication between internet and nodes 

This makes sense from a layer 3 perspective but what are the potential problems here?  

EDIT - I tried drawing a crude diagram demonstrating that the firewall loops off the router

CLOSETS
SERVERS &lt;----   CORE ROUTER (firewall loops off this) &lt;-----------&gt; INTERNET


Potential design #2:

- 2 firewalls
- Server network in between on the router ports.

This design makes more sense to me and we can do transparent bridging without having to change routing. The biggest downfall here is we are investing in two firewalls and if we wanted redundancy that comes to 4 firewalls (x2 at each bridging point).


EDIT - crude diagram below of two firewalls that are ""bumps"" on the line in between the end-users + router and in between router + internet.

CLOSETS &lt;----| firewall| ------&gt;   CORE ROUTER  &lt;---  | Firewall | -----&gt; INTERNET
                                                     |  
                                                SERVERS


What other design considerations I am missing here and what can some of you in the field give me in terms of advice in implementation here? One potential design I didn't add would involve us getting a Cisco firewall module inserted into the core router. The cost of one of those seems to be much higher than going the separate firewall route but I could revisit that if it makes the most sense and I can argue that.

The default gateway for vPC1 is 10.100.10.1 (R1). So the packet should go from vPC1 -&gt; R1 -&gt; R2 -&gt; R3 -&gt; ASA -&gt; Laptop.

Viewing the routing table on vrf lan10 on **R1** shows:

    Routing Table: lan10

         172.30.0.0/24 is subnetted
    S       172.30.1.0 [1/0] via 10.100.10.250
         10.0.0.0/24 is subnetted
    C       10.100.10.0 is directly connected

A route to the 172.30.1.0-network is there

The VRF lan10 (Where the host is placed) have following routing table on R2:

    Routing Table: lan10
    
         172.30.0.0/24 is subnetted
    S       172.30.1.0 [1/0] via 192.168.200.1
         10.0.0.0/24 is subnetted
    C       10.100.10.0 is directly connected

and the routing table for the **fvrf** (inet-vrf) looks like this:

    Routing Table: inet-vrf
    Gateway of last resort is 192.168.200.1 to network 0.0.0.0

    S*   0.0.0.0/0 [1/0] via 192.168.200.1



Routing table on **R3**:

    Gateway of last resort is not set
    
         172.30.0.0/24 is subnetted
    S       172.30.1.0 [1/0] via 192.168.250.2

And lastly

    Gateway of last resort is 192.168.250.1 to network 0.0.0.0
    
    C    172.30.1.0 255.255.255.0 is directly connected

today i discover that the whole network is a single /24 subnet. this subnet stretches across the 100mbit link! now i might not know much about networking, the current gear can route also however) so it seems to me a prime chance to fix this situation.

the problem is, desktops, switches, and servers at the office site. of course, changing the servers is a no go because that will probably break the services running on them.

there are a couple of internet links, further complicating the scenario.

my first thought was to fix it before i install any new kit. change all the desktops, printers, and any other devices (there are alot, including a VOIP system, thankfully on its own subnet) sitting at head office into a new subnet, and configure routing over to the other site. the logistics of doing this change, being i am one person and this is a high profile client

I am now starting to think I should simply leave it as is. configure all my new equipment in new subnets

thoughts? am i missing another potential hybrid type solution? anyone done this before?

TL;DR someone built a network and stretched it across a wan without implementing different subnets for each location. wondering whether to fix it.

Basically
  
I have an entry level and advanced course.  This is what I intend to cover in each course:   

**Entry (in no particular order)**  
NetBIOS  
TCP/IP (Subnetting
OSI Seven Layer  
Ethernet Packet Sniffing (ARP)  
Basic Routing (Static NAT)  
Wireless Routing (Basically just configuring a home wifi router)  
Windows Command Line Tools (ipconfig, nbtstat, netstat, etc)  
DNS  
DHCP  
Popular Application Protocols  
Windows File/Printer Sharing/Basic Permissions  
  
**Advanced (in no particular order)**  
Linux Server  
  -Permissions  
  -File System  
 -Command Line   
 -RAID

Linux Routing  
Proxy Server  
Set up Kerberos (haven't done this yet
DNS Server  
SSH Tunnelling  
VPN Server (haven't done this yet
Email server (haven't done this yet
   
My advanced course is basically a hodge podge of Linux server stuff I've done along with a few things I want to learn.    
   
Equipment:  Hubs, Cisco 2600 (I've learned just enough iOS to set it up as a router.  No experience with communal routing protocols like RIP)

1337690678.0,tz5vz,Quick discussion on 'types' of jobs and how not to scare college students away from networking,seanx820,24,4,33,"I saw [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/txm86/what_is_it_like_being_a_network_engineer/) and the answers are really concerning to me.  I usually reply into the thread but thought this really needs to become a discussion of its own.

A network engineer or network architect is a really ambiguous term [even according to wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_engineering).  In my head this is how I break them up and feel free to discuss

*  A lot of people who utilize this subreddit, you are not architecting but more maintaining and planning around a live network.  The reason a lot of people hate on degrees is this category actually has a lot of mix (people with or without degrees).  A lot of people start in tech support with minor certifications (like A+ or Security+).  It can be high stress but high reward.  I would think the equivalent for Microsoft would be a MCSE.  This type of job is really varied and can be as low as maintaing a small branch office or as high as working as a CCIE for JPMC in NYC on the trading floor.  
*  Secondly **Network Developers** are people who program *Network Appliances* such as routers, load balancers etc, or develop test scripts to make sure the gear functions as intended.  A lot of what I do falls here which creates a lot of frustration for me.  I have more in common sometimes with software developers at gaming companies then I do with some people on this subreddit.  Thats why sometimes I am like 'oh this again' when I see someone studying for their CCNA instead of actually wanting to understand OSPF or how a RFC works they just want the $ from the cert.  I saw some good advice on that previous thread that if you don't love networks you shouldn't foce yourself into it, I think I can back that up.  I really love my job b/c I get to program solutions for automation testing and make sure the gear you deploy works when you put into a network.
* Finally **Network Engineers** to me really need to have an engineering degree...  You can't just say your an engineer without doing engineering, or the computer network doctor.  I am sure people do that too but the point is how frustrating it is to say you are something that you are not...  To be honest its just a title but I think the industry needs to focus more on the differences.  I see network engineers more as high level architects whether its creating a new queuing system for packets in hardware on a particular blade (hardware engineering) or designing a network (similar to a network admin but a lot of times infinitely more complex, like I want to see math equations on the board for QOS policies) or developing a new algorithm to compute SLAAC entries or OSPF re-reroutes faster.  I don't think you can become a network engineer right out of school (or anyones first job).  I think its something you develop into... and while I think a degree is really important and I can argue the differences, there are people (albeit few) that I consider network engineers that don't have degrees.

Honestly I just want people to see the different ways you can go in the industry.  Network Engineers usually have degrees.  You can make a load of $ anyway but your day-to-day job is really different.  I never work on live networks, were not that smart and then got a shitty job where you are on call all the time.  You!=them.  Plenty of people in this subreddit love their job.

**quick edit** I also think these are 3 really really broad categories, hardware focused, encryption focused (yeah i separated encryption and security), and the list goes on and on but I think this list kind of is a good start for broad categories

I like a lot of the responses, based on my own experiences** but I just want all networking jobs, from the guy who wires your house in, to the guy designing the new next gen routing protocol to be known to all.  Thx",,False,,1337784027.0,t3_tz5vz

Recently

With a proc mem sorted I identified that our BGP Router process was utilizing 117MB to itself. Which after reading about BGP was odd since we are receiving a partial IPV4 BGP table which shouldn't require nearly that much resources. In addition

Thinking memory leak we consulted Cisco via a TAC case and their recommendations were as follows:

Reload the router.
Reduce your number of routes.
Add additional RAM.
And yes

The router had been reloaded two weeks earlier and had resumed the high memory utilization we had been seeing. Also

On a suggestion from a contractor and super genius we checked if perhaps there was an IPV6 table along side our v4. Lo and behold

I disabled the IPV6 address-family an hour ago and it freed up a whopping 8MB. From 117MB to 109MB, so that's nice. Now I'm at a loss, mateys.

This sub has been super enlightening to a new CCNA who got a job blending Network Admin/Engineer/Architect which has me over my head

If you have any suggestions or reading that I could do on this issue it would be very much appreciated.

EDIT: Thank you for your suggestions! I came in today to find out more about some of your suggestions and I found something interesting and perhaps our problem.

The setup is fairly straight forward.  The routers currently operate with the traditional crypto map configuration on their ISP connected interface.  We are migrating to a GRE over IPSec (DMVPN) topology and want to run it in parallel with the existing VPN.  (Once the migration is complete the existing crypto map based VPN will be decommissioned)  The crypto profile will be configured on the GRE tunnel interface with the ISP connected interface (which the crypto map is configured on) as the ingress/egress point.  These routers are the remote branch routers in this topology.  The DMVPN hubs are different than than the existing VPN hubs.

I *think* the only potential issue would be if the IP address allocation for the GRE tunnel interfaces are matched in the crypto map.  (This obviously won't be the case)  But it is certainly possible that I am missing something.

If anyone has a thought on this I'd appreciate hearing it.

1368740457.0,1eh74l,Setting Up Private VLANs,Eight_Quarter_Bit,25,5,5,"Hello

I've been beating my head against some VLAN related shenanigans for a while now

First

We have six physical sites interconnected via a gigabit fiber MAN. Originally we were six separate LANs, with a single web filter and a caching server.

Our switching consists of 3Com 4500s

We are currently a single subnet/VLAN spanning all six sites

Our goal is to separate the sites into VLANs for the following purposes:

1. We need to apply different web filter rules to the different sites. This can be accomplished if we can assign IP ranges (within the same subnet) to different sites

2. Limit communication from each site to *only* that site

At the same time, rather than traditional layer 3 routing / subnets.

It's a sticky problem.

From what I've researched, would accomplish my goals. What I'm having trouble finding info on how to configure private VLANs for my network hardware. So, specifically my questions are:

1. Do ""private VLANs"" require special hardware

2. How would you actually set up the switches, ACLs, etc?

3. Does traffic from the private VLANs to the shared VLAN have the private VLAN tags stripped or modified once it enters the shared VLAN?

4. Does traffic from the shared VLAN gain tags for the destination private VLANs when it enters each private VLAN?

5. Would using a single DHCP server + relay agents work in such a scenario

I might be totally off base with some of these questions, (much like anything) the devil is in the details, and implementation is nothing but.

I'm open to hearing solutions alternative to using private VLAN. I'm more concerned with achieving the goals of a shared datacenter,,False,,t5_2qkaf,False,,True

This location is across the street from the fiber line and is currently being developed, which means I could buy the land. I know the owners and I know if I paid a descent price they would allow me to buy it, as it is zoned for commercial use.  
	Also I might add that .78 miles down the road from said lot is a POP (point of presence)

There are easily 2,000 homes within a 5 mile radius and the water tower and site sit on a hill which would provide great coverage and direct line of site of the potential customers.

Note: There is a great wiki on the Ubiquiti forms on how to setup and maintain a WISP.

I was absolutely floored and destroyed by detailed, router turn ups, troubleshooting, static routing, BGP configuration and weight+AS design and implementation with OSPF failover on the fly.

What startled me was how I truly have no idea what I am doing.

I did not know how OSPF worked on the packet level.
I could not answer how does BGP choose routes in a less than general way.
I could not name the composition of a standard IPv4 packet.
It goes on.

I could absolutely floor with QoS, subnetting, design and/or review, but when it came to what I was using and the actual theory of it all, I died in the water. It was embaressing and extremely humbling as well.

I guess I wanted to ask... Where can I start to really ""learn"" everything. I feel as if I was thrown into the ice and have managed to stay on top of it by troubleshooting methodology and prowess

Thanks for your help last time (I should go and post my results which was probably a work around rather then a solution)

I have network (duh) that is basically a large switched network separated by VLAN's.

My problem is
Each end user would be getting their own public IP. 
And yet

I thought this kind of traffic wasn't meant to happen because it's not broadcast. It's unicast traffic.
Particularly because its just a Switched network and not working on the IP level

I have a mikrotik at one point in the network where I through up a firewall rule 3 days ago to block all traffic on that VLAN going through that switch with IP address to or from 192.168.0.0/16 and the firewall has 28.6Gb of packets it's dropped

I'll do my best to describe the situation

I'm looking at trace routes to make this determination.  Due to not wanting to identify my place of employment I am not going to post a direct trace route.

When I trace route to anywhere the trace will look like this:

1.  My router 192.168.1.1
2.  The default gateway for the private IP range we use to manage our DOCSIS modems 10.x.0.1 it's a /16 network
3.  The public IP for our CMTS

This is a DOCSIS 3.0 cable modem network.

It is step 2 that I'm getting hung up on

To preface

Our company was previously using Cbeyond through a T1/PRI (I think). 

We switched to Time Warner because it was cheaper and purchased DIDs from Flowroute. 

We are using a PBXtra server that is semi monitored/maintained by Fonality. 

Our issues began when we attempted to register our Pbxtra Server with Flowroute. (We flat out cannot register)

During a recent conference between multiple parties

(see pastebin link)

http://pastebin.com/RLsTNhxy

According to the Fonality tech, it hops to a private IP (10.36.32.1) which is on Time Warner's end.  The Fonality tech believes this is causing us to be unable to register our Pbx server with Flowroute and causing us to be unable to use our VOIP services the way we wish to. 

I spoke TWC support and they say that this is the way their network is structured and they cannot change it.

We recently got in a new batch of S50V (S50N) units and I am tasked with putting them into production. These are hardware base units running the FTOS (instead of the SFTOS I am familiar with).

On the SA-01 units I would simply go in and add the management IP address to the management interface:

    config t
    interface managementethernet
    ip address 10.10.10.239 255.255.255.0

And I would be on my marry way.

However these new FTOS based units seem to be operating in a Layer 3 mode by default. I can assign an IP address to one of the interfaces and talk to the unit

I am struggling for a clue on how I should configured these

Right now I have figured out that I can set each port on the device as a switchport and that effectively makes them all operate in Layer 2 mode. However, but that doesn't work. I tried assigning an IP address to a loopback interface, but that didn't work either.

I am grasping at straws here and my googlefoo has failed me,False,,t5_2qkaf,False,,,t3_19meol
1362265120.0,19jnz8,BFD async vs echo mode - any quantifiable benefit to echo mode?,microseconds,18,2,6,"So

The big question - BFD echo mode.  Is there any actually quantifiable benefit to using echo mode instead of async mode?  Guy #1 doesn't know any reason why echo mode is better. The only thing guy #2 keeps saying is that echo mode can be done entirely in the forwarding plane

That statement is patently false.  I know this, *not* on the RE.
