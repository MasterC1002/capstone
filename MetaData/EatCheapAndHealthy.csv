You can also add optional ingredients, raisins, nuts, WHATEVER. The possibilities are endless. Don't add too many, though - a handful is fine. I've found if you go overboard on the extra ingredients the cookies tend to fall apart.

**TLDR: See OP title.**

**EDIT:** You guys are AWESOME. This is a huge help for me. Thanks so much! I truly appreciate it.

---

**BACKGROUND**

I wrapped up graduate school about a year ago and now have the money and time to eat better.

But I haven't. I know I eat out too much, and 2-3 pints per go)

The fact that I'm an actual adult is starting to catch up to me, I can do it.) 

I'm living with a roommate still in graduate school so I only have half a fridge and freezer to myself. I'm willing to trash everything in my cupboards, although I've started taking to freezing bananas and blueberries.

Here are my habits/pitfalls/other lifestyle choices that I've become cognizant about:

* I don't really like cooking. That's not true, I can cook enough and eat the leftovers for days, but this gets tiresome.
* The cafeteria at my work is actually cheap and awesome. (But it's not as cheap as packing my lunch!) I tend to eat subs or salads and avoid the burger grill. When I'm in a rush on breakfast
* I try to eat whole wheat whenever possible. Bagels, etc. Although I'm Asian so in a pinch I reach for jasmine rice. 
* My coworkers decided to keep their drawers full of chocolate
* The veg I tend to like to prepare for dinner typically gets sauteed or grilled. Asparagus, onions. I need to branch out more. 
* I eat too much red meat
* When I eat breakfast at home, and smoked salmon. Occasionally there'll be (Greek or not) yogurt mixed in with either bananas or strawberries, and/or granola. 
* I don't ever drink soda.
* There tends to be a sporting event my friends and I want to go see at least once a week
* I've committed to working out on the [Starting Strength](http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/Starting_Strength_Wiki) program. I've missed a day here or there but that's due to another exercise event (hikes
* I need to cardio more. I can run 3mi in 24-26 minutes without stops
* I work a 9/80 schedule - that is

I've recognized that I need to change things up *now*

---

**MY QUESTION FOR YOU

I'm looking on tips for what to keep in my fridge, I think, comes from the fact that *I just don't know what to keep on hand* to make a meal fairly quickly, so I go for easy stuff like Hamburger Helper with random veggies thrown in.

* Marinara sauce.  I buy this horribly expensive shit called Rao's because it's super natural and delicious.  Like one better? Make it yourself? Do that.

**What You Need**

* 1/3 lb spaghetti noodles
* 1 clove garlic
* 1/2 cup olive oil
* 1 cup fresh spinach
* 1/4 cup of lemon juice
* 1 tsp parsley 
* 1/4 cup Parmesan
* Pepper to taste

**What You Do**

1. Cook Spaghetti noodles how you normally would cook them. My boyfriend and I used some leftover

2. In a large skillet

3. Turn heat to medium

4. Keep the heat at medium. Add spaghetti noodles to skillet, garlic, and olive oil. Add the remaining 1/4 cup of oil to the top of the spaghetti and mix until the noodles are thoroughly coated in the oil and the spinach is evenly distributed throughout the pasta.

5. Turn the heat off. Add the lemon juice to the pasta

6. Add pepper to taste. Serve.

Like I said, the ingredients to make it cost about $2.18, with ingredients from HyVee and Walmart. It made about 3 good servings. We each had it for dinner last night and I had it for lunch today, so per serving it's about $.73, which is really cheap and good, especially for college students like us.

1376067577.0,1k1ais,Last night I made an amazing meal inspired by r/foodporn and aided by r/EatCheapAndHealthy. It is one of the most cost effective and still yummy recipes I've ever tried.,jentarvin,180,34,9,"I saw the [drool worthy version](http://www.reddit.com/r/FoodPorn/comments/1jt8yy/after_3_grueling_hours_of_a_4_step_process_meal/) of al kabsa that [r/st1234](http://www.reddit.com/user/st1234) posted a few days ago on [r/foodporn](http://www.reddit.com/r/FoodPorn/) and was inspired!

So I took a look at the [recipe](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/al-kabsa---traditional-saudi-rice-and-chicken/) that was linked. I had mostly everything that was called for already in my pantry! However

A quick amazon search revealed that [dried limes](http://www.amazon.com/AASAN-Dried-Lime-Whole-Amani/dp/B0036ZI2GU/ref=sr_1_1?s=grocery&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1376065542&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=dried+limes) were going to cost me at least $22 and leave me with more dried limes than I have any right to try to store in my tiny kitchen.  

My first reaction was to check with gourmet shops in my area. I assumed the cost per weight might be skewed

So I went down to [an AMAZING international market in my area](http://www.yelp.com/biz/shayan-supermarket-torrance) to see what I could find. And voila

It got me thinking about how much this meal cost in general. After the initial spice investment, chicken, onion, 3 carrots, half a stick of butter, can of tomatoes, can of tomato paste and a few raisins. Roughly, he's 6'7'' with an appetite to match his stature and we only went through a 3rd of it. So for an estimated $15 dollars (if you factor in the a little bit of spice cost every time you make it) one could easily get 6 servings of incredible food. That's $2.50 a serving. I'm going to freeze my left overs in travel size pyrex and have them for lunches next week. 

(Side note: it didn't take me 3 hours. It took me an 1.25 hours. I used fresh chicken breast tenders that didn't need to cook as long

**TL:DR** Save 90% on spices at international markets and make awesome food using spices and basic healthy ingredients and save money! http://imgur.com/a/2foCp

- Separate yolks from egg whites and place egg whites in a bowl

- Add egg whites to heated pan. Sprinkle with salt

- Cover the pan and continue cooking for about 5 minutes (it's important to keep it covered)

your oatmeal (powdered milk, raisins, etc.) and it's ready to take with you. All you have to do is add hot water and let it sit for one minute - the same as with the expensive little pre-made packets. 

It's also super easy to turn oatmeal into granola which makes a great cold breakfast cereal with a little bit of yogurt or milk. The recipe I make is:

* 4 cups old fashioned oats
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 1/2 cup chopped almonds
* 1/2 cup raisins
* 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
* 1/4 teaspoon of kosher salt
* 1/3 cup canola oil
* 1/4 cup honey
* 1 tablespoon vanilla

In a large bowl mix oats, raisins, cinnamon, and salt.

In a microwave safe bowl heat canola oil and honey until warm

Spread evenly on a parchment or silpat covered cookie sheet. Bake at 300º for about 20 minutes until slightly golden brown. Don’t stir during baking. Cool completely and break into pieces. Store in an air tight container.

You can freeze food in them. Wide-mouth jars are even marked on the side with a fill-line specifically for the freezer. 

You can store dry goods in them. Brown sugar stays soft

You can refrigerate leftovers in them.

This is breakfast, both were obese but have been losing weight over the past year (nearly 100lbs between the two of us!), along with lifting to try to build some muscle. We try to keep our carbs fairly low, and our protein fairly high. We also eat paleo/primal and I have a cow's dairy allergy, so we have some substitutions to regular recipes. Feel free to use milk/cow's cheese/butter in place of our substitutions if you can, it'll save you some money! You could probably get a few of these things cheaper (specifically the chicken), but we have a happy compromise between cost and prep time. 

Grocery list:

15 dozen large eggs ($17

1 gal farm-fresh milk

1 kilo goat cheese ($17

1 quart goat's milk ($4)

5# bananas ($2.50 or so)

5-7# sweet potatoes (garnet yams) ($5 or so)

5# smoked sausage or polska kielbasa ($14)

4-5# jalapenos

5# onions

1# bell peppers (or 4-5 if they're sold per each) ($3 or so)

1 bunch celery ($1 or so)

1# carrots ($1 or so)

5# boneless skinless chicken breasts or thighs ($10 or so

5# of whatever beef is cheapest, we normally buy in bulk whenever there's a good sale)

1 gal olive oil ($11)

6# can tomato sauce ($3)

6# can diced tomatoes ($4)

1# quinoa ($4)

1 bunch fresh cilantro ($.50)

Large bag frozen mixed berries ($6)

1# clam meat ($4)

1# shrimp meat ($4)

4# bacon ends and pieces ($5)

1 jar of pepproncini ($3 for a small one

$40 flex budget or so on treats like fresh fruit, for stocking up on sale items, for picking up other veggies/items to try, for replenishing spices and other consumables, or for upgrading items higher up the list.


Breakfasts:

Eggs. Lots of eggs. Either fried in a lightly oiled pan, Tabasco/Frank's Red Hot/Tapatio/Sriracha, whatever keeps them from getting too boring! Serve with [sweet potato hash](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/18hak8/whole_foods_wednesday_sweet_potato_hash_and_fried/), or bacon, or a banana, or maybe even some smoked sausage/kielbasa.

Lunches:

Lunches are usually more of a snack for us than a real meal. Smoothies made with banana and frozen berries are common, and baked sweet potato fries. Our fallback for when we're hungry and lazy is cooking up some bacon or sausage/kielbasa.  

Dinners:

Here's where we shine! Dinner is bonding time, [beef stew](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/15jsyr/simple_and_cheap_beef_stew_slowcookerpaleo_option/), [Hardtoremember's clam chowder](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/16wh9c/home_made_clam_chowder_is_easy_and_yummy_soupy/) (I substitute sweet potatoes for the regular, and goat's milk for the evaporated milk), [chicken and quinoa soup](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/15s0rx/chicken_quinoa_soup_slowcooker/), and the everpresent roasted veggies/poppers/lazymeal options from lunch. All of these dinner options listed above make at least 4 servings, if not 6+. I'm the type to get bored with a recipe after a few weeks, when my tastes change or when I find better things to make. These are just our current rotation!

I hope this helps some people out some! We spent this much, and we thought we were getting the best bang for our buck. How wrong we were!

We shop at WinCo, chest freezer, and a meat grinder. Most of our meals are cooked in a crockpot, with the majority of the rest being stovetop meals. If you have any questions, please ask!

1.5 cups of cooked rice

1 Large chicken breast

1 granny smith apple

1 medium sized yellow onion

The rest I didn't really quantify:

Sriracha sauce (enough to the point where I could smell if off the food

Vegetable oil

Chili flakes

Garlic powder (or real garlic works too

Start off by cutting the chicken breast into tiny pieces and bake it until it was done with a coating of oil

Boil the rice while the chicken is baking

Throw the rice into a freezer for a few minutes to cool off while heating a large pan with an oil to Sriracha mixture (about a 4:1 mix if I had to mind's-eyeball it.)

Once the pan is heated put in the rice and onions in and lay on a bit more Sriracha.

Once the rice is nice and colorful put in the diced apple and chicken.

Keep tasting it every 3 minutes or so. You'll know it's done when the onions are caramelized and the sweetness of the apple is subdued but not gone.

INSTRUCTIONS

Place 1/4 cup of the flour and the measured salt and pepper in a
large bowl and whisk to combine; set aside. Trim the roast of excess fat and sinew and cut it into 1- to 1-1/2-inch cubes. Place the meat in the flour mixture and toss to coat; set aside.

Heat the oil in a large, until browned all over, about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove to a large bowl. Repeat with the remaining meat in 2 more batches; set aside.

Add the onion to the pot and season with salt and pepper. Cook, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato paste, stir to coat the onion, and cook until the raw flavor has cooked off, about 1 to 2 minutes.

Sprinkle in the remaining tablespoon of flour and cook, about 1 minute. Pour in the wine, scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot, and cook until the mixture has thickened, about 3 minutes.

Return the meat and any accumulated juices in the bowl to the pot. Add the broth

Cut the carrots, if desired). Stir to combine, cover with a tightfitting lid, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables and meat are knife tender, about 1 hour more.

Remove and discard the bay leaves and thyme stems. Stir in the peas and simmer uncovered until warmed through

2 small salmon fillets ($5 a bag at Walmart)(about 75 cents a serving)

1/4 onion sliced thin (maybe 20 cents)

1 roma tomato sliced thin (50 cents)

1/3 bell pepper sliced thin

1/2 avocado mashed (eat the other half!) ($1.50)

1 head butter lettuce (use the big leaves)($2)

A little sour cream

Salt/pepper to taste

**Too easy:**

All you have to do is pan fry the salmon with a little salt and pepper for a few minutes on each side being careful not to over cook. When done put on a cutting board and break it up into pieces. Now just build your wrap with your salmon, bell pepper, avocado and sour cream (just a little) on the lettuce, with hot sauce if you like. It's a very fresh and green tasting meal. Each filet will make 2 to 3 wraps depending on how big you make them.

THE TL;DR: cook large amounts of meal components every week or two.  freeze sauces in ice cube trays, meat, and veggies on a baking sheet and break up a lot while it freezes so they don't stick together.  also can freeze soup in ice cube trays.  round out with homemade bread, salads.  control macros with psyllium husk fiber and unflavored protein powder.  this method means you save money by being able to shop in bulk and use everything up and having to clean less dishes by cooking large amounts. save time from washing dishes, and cooking full meals every night.

THE FULL POST:

If you're okay with having a similar format for all your meals and have time to devote to doing mass cooking at this scale

STEPS:

SAUCES: I make a different sauce every few days or so to replenish the stock--white clam sauce, Asian black bean sauce, sriracha honey sauce, pad thai sauce, tikka masala sauce, curry sauce, mole sauce, and anything else I'm in the mood for. I then freeze them in ice cube trays and pop them into the appropriate labelled bag.

CARB: At some point I'll make a ton of rice, I'll twirl a fork in the pasta to make a pasta nest, and freeze these on cookie sheets (if you've ever gotten a Bertolli's meal with the longer pastas you know what I'm talking about as far as nests--they should be around 1.5-2 inches in diameter). For the rice, I just spread it over the baking sheet, let it freeze about halfway and then break it up into small pieces, and let it finish freezing. If you like the pasta shapes (my personal preference is for long pasta) you can freeze them similar to the rice, just in a flat layer on a baking sheet and break them up as much as possible during the freezing process to keep them from forming into chunks.

PROTEIN: Next, chicken thighs, whatever cheap cut of beef I can find (usually stew meat), shrimp, sometimes bay scallops, pork tenderloin or pork butt/shoulder (use crockpot for butt/shoulder), and salmon or another fish. I cut them into small pieces and freeze them on a flat baking sheet so that they are not touching and do not freeze into large blocks. Be careful not to overcook them--they should just barely be done

VEGGIES: I then do the same thing with fresh vegetables (it's easier to just use the steamer veggie bags, green beans, and broccoli for Asian meals, asparagus, cauliflower, and mushrooms for Italian style food, etc etc. really depends on what I find in the grocery store. I don't actually fully cook them


Once you've got it all bagged and labelled you're done. Every night I just toss a few cubes of the sauce in a pan with a couple chunks of frozen pasta or rice
This is really regimented cooking, and whittle down your cooking time little by little, so it might be overkill for most.

Of course, or saute some chicken breast, but I also want to minimize the number of dishes and steps I use. One pan and one spatula every night, and instead of having to rewash a pot several times every time you cook pasta, I just make a ton at once so it's just one big pot to wash. I put down a sheet of aluminum foil on the baking sheets that I'm freezing on so they don't have to be washed.

Also, since you've already got a ton of food and just need to heat it up. You'll just have to replenish your stock afterward!

Also

I will also help spread these meals further by making my own healthy no-knead bread.  There are plenty of no-knead recipes out there, flax, oatmeal, spelt, etc.  also try including sprouted grains, there are instructions online for how to sprout grains!

I'll also make salads with apple cider vinegar as the only dressing, a cheap normal-type leaf if I can find it (romaine or something), or occasionally kale.

Additionally, including the main meals above or the bread.  maybe not the salad though.)  I would also pick up some unflavored whey protein and/or casein protein and/or a mix.  I get mine from:

* Vegetable/canola oil
* 2 medium-sized potatoes
* 1/2 yellow onion
* 1 tomato. I used a vine tomato
* Tortillas of your choice. I prefer small corn tortillas.
* Shredded cheese. Store-bought ""Mexican"" blend stuff is fine.
* Salt &amp; pepper

1. Dice the onion &amp; tomato. Peel &amp; dice the potatoes. The smaller you dice the potatoes

2. Heat a pan over medium heat &amp; add about 1 tbsp. of oil. Throw in the onion &amp; cook for about 2 minutes

3. Throw in your potatoes &amp; cook for about 2 minutes. Add in the tomatoes

This is where you can (and should) experiment with adding other ingredients. While you can keep it as is &amp; probably get a decent meal out of it, and a tiny bit of turmeric. If you have some round steak, you could slice it really thin, fry it in another pan for a few minutes, then add it in. Or add beans. Or chop some red peppers. It's a very Bob Ross recipe. Happy potatoes.

4. Once everything's done cooking

5. Heat the pan again, sprinkle more cheese, and fold the tortilla over. If you're using 2 small tortillas, put the second one on top &amp; press down on it with a spatula for a minute. Cook until the tortilla is golden brown, then flip. Serve with sour cream, guacamole, Cerveza Pacifico Clara

One whole chicken (only about $4)

1/2 bag of egg noodles. 

1 cup of white wine if you have it.

For the stock:

In a very large pot full of water (just over the top of the chicken) keep the chicken on a low boil for around 3 or 4 hours (this is where I add the wine) then remove and set aside the chicken to cool. Strain off the stock into another pot and put on the stove on low heat. You can skim off the fat if you want but I think it makes it taste better. We also usually set aside about 4 cups of stock to use in other things such as spaghetti sauce.

Now on to the soup:

In a small frying pan saute (in butter) your chopped vegetables with your spices. Add the vegetables to the stock and turn to medium. Remove the chicken skin and separate the chicken from the bones and chop to desired size. After you  add the chicken to your stock you should have enough left over for chicken sandwiches.

Eggs have received a bad rap in the past, and only 70 calories. A dozen eggs costs around $2 ( I get mine for 90 cents), so at 16 cents a serving, they also make an economical addition to your breakfast.

You may not have time to scramble eggs in the morning


It only takes two minutes to scramble an egg in the microwave. If you want to avoid the cholesterol found in the egg yolk

Ingredients

1 tbsp olive oil

1 pound turkey sausage

1 green or red sweet pepper

1 small onion

12 large eggs

1/2 cup 2% milk (optional)

1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper

cheese

salsa (optional)

12-14 medium sized tortillas



Directions

In a large skillet, and onion.

Break the sausage up into tiny pieces and brown the sausage until completely cooked
    
In a large bowl, salt, and pepper until combined.
    

Heat a large non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Add a tablespoon of butter and melt all over the pan. Add the eggs and scramble until cooked through.

Warm the tortillas in microwave per the package instructions.

Layer 1/2 cup scrambled eggs, and a little salsa on a warmed medium-sized tortilla. Fold up into a burrito.
    
Place each burrito on a baking sheet lined with wax paper and flash-freeze in the freezer for at least 60 minutes. Wrap each burrito in foil and store in a freezer bag in the freezer.

Dough:

* 1/2 C. milk
* 1 T. yeast
* 1 C. whole wheat flour
* 1 C. white flour (+ about 1/4 cup for kneading)
* 1/4 C. brown sugar
* 1/2 t. salt
* 1/4 C. pumpkin puree
* 1 egg

Sift together the salt, beating it until it's totally free of lumps. When all the flours are added, knead the dough for 5 to 10 minutes until it's smooth and a little damp feeling but doesn't stick to your hands. Put the dough in an oiled bowl, set it in a warm place and let it rise to double.
 
Filling:

* 1/4 C. applesauce
* 1/2 C. brown sugar
* 1 T. cinnamon

Punch the dough down and roll it out into a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. Spread the applesauce over the dough. Sprinkle on the brown sugar and cinnamon. Roll up the dough tightly and pinch the edge down so it stays rolled up. Cut it into 12 using a really sharp knife or a piece of thread so they don't squich down. Place the rolls in a lightly oiled baking pan and cover loosely. Place them in the fridge for 6 to 8 hours - overnight is fine.

Icing:

* 3 C.  powdered sugar
* 1/4 t. vanilla
* 2 T. milk

Remove the cinnamon rolls from the fridge and let them sit on the counter while you preheat the oven to 350F. Remove the cover and bake for approximately 30 minutes. While the rolls are baking

Yeah the ingredients changed, but I always remember it being bomb and absolutely delicious, so now that I am a students and living on scraps, this has become one of my favorite meals to try and get all of my nutrients

Here is one example of an egg scramble/Poor Man's Meal I just made this afternoon for my boyfriend and I.

* Half an onion ($0.50)
* Mushrooms ($0.50)
* 1 Avocado ($1.25)
* Salt, hot sauce (Not sure on price since I buy in bulk on these items and they last forever)

Just heat the onions and mushrooms in olive oil and some salt and pepper until they have cooked down a bit.  Add the eggs and once theyre about half down

I'm a bad eater. There, I can't even think of ideas of what to eat. I don't enjoy salads of any kind (except for the fattening pasta kind), and I don't care for fish at all.

I had a ""healthy-eating"" streak at some point where I ate a lot of chopped vegetable-chicken combo, to the point where I can't even eat it anymore.

I would eat much more fruit than I do

I've been looking here for advice

I have access to fridge, all the stuff. Not a slow-cooker though. I'm not very good at eating remains either ... something about leaving it in the fridge, dunno. It just makes me feel bad for some reason.

Ingredients:    
1 Onion (your preference)    
1 Green Pepper (or yellow
Broccoli    
1 pound of Chicken    
Olive Oil    

Ok
First things first- You do not have to use the entire pound of chicken. But if you do, etc, as you will want it for the flavoring. You can proportion it this way: 1 pound = 1 veggie, so on and so forth    

    
Alright
Trow some olive oil in a skillet
Cut up your veggies how you wish
Ok
Put your olive oil in the skillet and make it hot!    
Then toss the chicken and veggies in and sizzle away. Be sure to stir (hence the name :D)        
Add spices, or only one salted. Spices with salt can really ruin a meal if you salt it too much.    
Throw in some Tobasco sauce for good measure (the little bottle is for cooking).    
Stir

A few things I like to do is this, and now you have a chicken taco. You can throw lettuce, tomatoes and a bit of sour cream on it at this rate and have a taco that rivals any Mexican restaurant.

I also add a can of Grabanzo beans. 

Then I add the basil, you should!)

last night i made curry for the first time and it was a huge success! i used this recipe as my jumping off point. i did have to make quite a few alterations though (lack of ingredients mostly) so you can adjust this to however you want. 

1. i didn't have red curry paste. ~~i used three tablespoons of yellow curry powder~~ you should use four

2. you don't have to use chicken breasts. just use whatever you have. if you really want it to taste good

3. i didn't use 1 1/3 cups of coconut milk. that's a LOT of coconut milk (almost an entire can). i used a little more than half of a can. you can use reduced fat coconut milk to make it healthier.

4. i added about 1.5 tablespoons of greek yogurt. 

5. didn't add the can of tomatoes. now that i think about it

**SPICES**

okay so here's where i really deviated from the recipe (except for the basil). i kind of just guessed and began throwing together herbs. i probably did 1.5 tsp cumin, a sprinkle of ground nutmeg and ground cloves, 1 tsp of smoked paprika and 1 tsp of red pepper flakes. you might want to use less/more of the spices depending on how you like your curry.

1/2 teaspoon garlic powder

1/2 teaspoon paprika

1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes

Salt and pepper to taste

1 zucchini (about $1) (chopped)

1 crook neck squash (about $1) (chopped)

The sauce:

Put one can of stewed tomatoes in the blender with salt and pepper and spices listed above and blend until smooth.

Lets get started:

In a large pan heat up your oil (medium high),  onions and garlic and brown. Once your onions are translucent add the chicken stock along with the sauce and mix.

* Trying to use very similar ingredients
* Nothing too extreme in taste
* Lunches we may be able to do on a BBQ
* Quick to make. 30 minutes or less total is ideal
* This will be in early October, with some possibility of rain.

As for how many meals/what days:

* Thursday afternoon snack (might be able to skip this)
* Thursday dinner likely after 9pm (yeah...)
* Friday breakfast
* Friday lunch
* Friday dinner, and filling)
* Saturday breakfast (must be quick

I just wanted to start out with my experience with gardening as someone who had never grown a thing in my life until 3 or so years ago. I only started as sort of a hobby to make my all rock yard green for my wife. I had the sudden thought

There is an initial cost for the soil and seeds but it depends on how much you want to grow. I always go over board and spent around $100, hot peppers, zucchini, radishes and sunflowers to attract bees. Well, it absolutely exploded until fairly quickly I had more than we could eat, and once they started producing I was hooked!. After building the gardens it was pretty easy; plant stuff, water it and let it grow! Now you'd think it would be hard to grow things in the desert but after adjusting the water everything was a go.

Just to give you an idea of what you can get out of a few seeds from a 99 cent pack, if at all. Now we've easily tripled our garden and use it as a hobby for me and my wife to do together, giving vegetables to our friends, neighbors and local soup kitchens. It may seem a bit daunting at first but once you start doing it and once you start walking outside to pick your dinner, you'll be absolutely hooked!

1. Bring three cups water to a boil. Add 1 1/2 cups sugar and stir until sugar has dissolved.
2. Lower the heat and add the zest from the lemons and limes. Simmer for 10 minutes
3. Remove the syrup mixture from the heat and add the lemon / lime juice. 
4. Filter the syrup through a fine mesh sieve.
5. Cool. Syrup can be refrigerated for up to 2 weeks. Adding a pinch of ascorbic acid will lengthen the shelf life

I know looking at the ingredients list that this recipe couldn't possibly be cheap- for me it was, and I keep soy sauce handy. All I really had to buy was the chicken and the hoisin sauce! 

Additionally, but I didn't have those- I had some Special K honey corn flakes. This turned out to be a GREAT substitution, as it gave the chicken a crunchy, sweet taste. I think you could probably substitute any corn flake type cereal here, even fiber ones, or health-nut ones if you'd like.

Finally, like [this one](http://iweb.cooking.com/images/products/enlarge/631878e.jpg), lined it with aluminum foil, and put the chicken right on the aluminum, no oil needed (so I cut out the veggie oil/canola spray oil in the process). That made cleanup a breeze, too.

I recently got married and moved to Manhattan with my husband. As expected, moving, and extended bouts of travel, we want to return to our earlier healthy eating habits while keeping to our budget (all that summer fun wasn't cheap!). 

Complicating factors are our combined dietary restrictions: no shellfish, no non-fermented dairy, no quinoa, minimal eggs and minimal starch/sugar. We also have limited storage space, so I find myself grocery shopping 2-3 times/week. In the winter, I would be making stews and casseroles that meet our needs, but they seem out of place in the summer. We can't just eat grilled chicken salad every night!

There are a ton of different ways to make primavera

What you'll need:

3 tomatoes ($1.50)

1 bell pepper ($1)

1/2 onion (20 cents)

2 cloves of garlic (?)

1 crown of brocolli (around 75 cents)

2 regular boxes of spaghetti ($2)

Basil, salt and pepper.

1/2 cup each white wine and chicken stock (to taste)

How to make it:

Start your pasta so it will be done before you start the veggies.

Cut your tomatoes, once your oil is hot (in a large pan) add the broccoli, onion, bell pepper, and garlic and after about 1 minute add the tomatoes. When the veggies start looking a little limp add the wine and cook off the alcohol.(When you can no longer smell the alcohol) Now add your chicken stock, toss the pasta into the veggies and you're ready to eat!

Chicken or shrimp are both very good in this too.

Ingredients:
Fresh Kale
dried green or brown lentils
fresh tomato (opt - it adds bright flavor and some nutrients
fresh lemon (opt - if you can afford it this is what really makes the dish)
bay leaf
salt
pepper
garlic
onion - I use red
oil for cooking - I usually use olive

Note: I don't measure things, you can always steam up some rice. Requires two cooking vessels - a pot for the lentils and a pan for the other bits. This is a good winter recipe, as the greens are cheap and fresh. It is very flexible, it can be more of a stewed dish or a soup. Whatever you're in the mood for.

Directions: 
Lentils+bay leaf in a pot + water. Bring to boil

While lentils cook, just test until it gets to an edible and pleasing consistency), add the optional tomatoes - personally I don't add much, just enough to give a bright flavor. 

Lentils should be about done by this point. You can either drain the water and add them to the pan, or just cut up and squeeze the lemon over the top. I usually use half the lemon on the food, and add the other half of the lemon on my water.

BTW Fresh greens are super easy to grow, and cheap - it got me through college. Alter as you like!

**Sushi rice**

1 cup rice

2 cups water

3 tbsp sushi rice vinegar [(I always use this brand)](http://www.giantunion.com/image/product/1500659_Vinegar_Mizkan_Sushi%20Vinegar_12x24oz.jpg)

If you are blessed with a rice cooker, turn it down to low and cover it. DO NOT REMOVE THE COVER UNTIL IT IS FINISHED. Let it boil on low for 10 minutes, then remove from the heat with the cover **ON** and let it set another 10 minutes. 

With either of these methods, but to fold, so you don't crush your grains. Once well combined, you are ready to make your sushi.

**Sushi assembly**

Lay out a sheet of nori (very cheap if you can hit an Asian market, then wet your fingers with the vinegar. Carefully pat your rice down onto your sheet, aiming for a thickness of 1/4"", and be sure to leave 1/2-3/4"" of plain nori at one end to seal. The rice will begin to stick to your fingers throughout this process, rewet your fingers with the vinegar whenever necessary. The rice needs to be hot, so this will suck if you have low heat tolerance like me. Once you have your sheet prepared, lay down a line of filling about 1"" from the edge opposite of your sealing edge (the uncovered nori needs to be the outer edge!). Clean off your fingers on a wet paper towel, trying to keep it as tight as possible. When you hit your plain nori edge

**Filling suggestions**

* Salmon and cream/goat cheese: Philly roll

* Crab meat and cream cheese: I don't know if this is a real roll

* Crab/salmon/tuna with avocado and cucumber: California roll

* Teriyaki salmon or chicken slices and cream/goat cheese: also a creation of mine

Legend vs. Fact



One of America’s fondest legends is that of Johnny Appleseed, planting apple seeds throughout the countryside, research reveal him to be a careful, organized businessman, who over a period of nearly fifty years, bought and sold tracts of land and developed thousands of productive apple trees.


His adventures began in 1792, headed west, following the steady stream of immigrants. In his early twenties, John began traveling alone, which is how he spent the rest of his life. Nathaniel stayed behind to farm with their father, who had also immigrated west. John continued moving west to Pennsylvania. From there he traveled into the Ohio Valley country and later, Indiana. He kept ahead of the settlements and each year planted apple seeds farther west.

He always carried a leather bag filled with apple seeds he collected for free from cider mills. Legend says he was constantly planting them in open places in the forests, fencing it in with fallen trees and logs, bushes and vines, sowing the seeds and returning at regular intervals to repair the fence, tend the ground and sell the trees. He soon was known as the “apple seed man” and later he became known only as “Johnny Appleseed”.

Over the years

He made friends with many Indian tribes and was known to have learned many Indian languages well enough to converse. He lived on food provided by nature and he never killed animals. Though appearing poor

Johnny Appleseed is described as a man of medium height, slender, wiry and alert. Folklore has also described him as “funny looking” because of the way he dressed. It is said he traded apple trees for settler’s cast-off clothing. He was known to give the better clothing to people he felt needed it more than he. This could be why legend says he wore only coffee sacks with holes cut out for his arms as clothing. He rarely wore shoes, even during the cold of winter. It is said he could walk over the ice and snow barefooted and that the skin was so thick on his feet that even a rattlesnake couldn’t bite through it. Another legend says he wore a mush pot on his head as a hat. This is unlikely since pots of the time were made of heavy copper or iron, but it is more likely he wore someone else’s castoff hat or made his own out of cardboard. He rarely sought shelter in a house, since he preferred to sleep on bare ground in the open forest with his feet to a small fire.

In 1842, the half brother with whom he began his remarkable journey. On March 18, 1845, he died of pneumonia at the age of seventy-one. He was visiting his friend, William Worth, in Indiana. Legend says it was the only time he was sick in his whole life.

Some of my variations, what are some ways you could customize this?",spyyked,25,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/1h45ap/baked_chicken_with_rice_and_veggies_cheap/

I loathe looking up healthy recipes.  It seems like each recipe I find has anywhere from 10-20 ingredients.  These ingredients usually are at least $1.50+ and I might only get 3 or 4 servings out of the whole recipe.  It's too complicated, too much prep/time, and way too expensive.  This is my go-to recipe for probably 80% of my meals.

you'll need:

walmart brand rice cooker: $20
baking sheet: $10

Food part:

bulk boneless skinless chicken breast at sams club: $1.88/lb. 6lbs/$12

white long grain rice: 5lb/$5 (i need to find it cheaper)

bag of frozen veggies in steamer bag: ~$1.50/bag

premixed seasonings from the grocery store: just got on sale for $1/bottle

cooking process:

preheat oven to 350. put chicken on baking sheet (use foil for easy cleanup). hit that chicken with the seasoning. put in oven for like 40 minutes. plug in rice cooker. put 2 cups dry rice in one bowl and 3.75 cups water in the rice cooker. fill the rice bowl with water just to cover the rice and give it a quick spin with your finger to get the excess starch/dirt off. I usually do that twice. dump into rice cooker and set to cook. rinse the bowl to be a container for when the rice is done cooking. go watch an episode of scrubs on netflix. take chicken out of oven when it's done. toss bag of veggies in the microwave, and put the rice cooker away. start cutting up your chicken until the veggies are done. make a plate of chicken, rice, and veggies.

here's how many servings i usually get out of each cooked part:

rice: 6 servings. I havent calculated the cost of this but it's pretty low.

veggie bag: 3 or 4 servings. $.50 per serving at most.

chicken: 7 or 8 servings. ~$1.50 per serving.

total cost is probably somewhere around $2.25/serving and you're eating a good quantity of very tasty highly nutritious food. The only dishes you need to clean are the rice pot (super easy) and the baking sheet (super easy if you use alum foil).

also this is a very good starting point recipe. I've turned it into soup by adding a box of chicken broth or some ramen. Add bbq sauce to the chicken and shred it for tasty sammiches. Curry if you want. stir fry the precooked meat with the veggies instead of microwaving them.  I've got a gas grill for cooking the chicken sometimes.  

What are some of the ways you can think to edit this recipe to make it more versatile while keeping the cost down and keeping it simple? ",self,t5_2vvpi,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/1h45ap/baked_chicken_with_rice_and_veggies_cheap/

Ingredients:

*  About 1 pound ground meat (I prefer turkey

*  1 medium onion   

*  1 can water chestnuts

*  4 Tbsp green curry paste (I use this ""Chef's Kitchen"" stuff because it's cheap
*  1 can coconut milk   
*  Optional: 1 green or red pepper 
*  1 cup uncooked brown rice 

Directions:

Start cooking the rice first, add the pepper and water chestnuts.   Stir them around a cook for another 10 minutes or so and then add the onions (adding them sooner will cause them to be mushier once its done).  About 5 minutes before the rice is finished cooking, add the coconut milk and turn the frying pan down to low.

When the rice is finished

This is a fairly mild (but still flavourable) mix.  If you think it needs more kick, or chop up a bouillon-cube sized chunk of ginger to mix in at the same time as the peppers.

You can just keep it in the fridge (it keeps better if you keep the rice and curry separate).  I've kept it for about a week without going bad.  It provides about 6 large bowls of curry.

Chocolate pudding

1/4 - 1/2c sugar (to taste)
4-5 tbsp cocoa powder

3 tbsp cornstarch

2 pinches salt

2 1/4c milk

1-2tbsp rum
OR
1/2 tsp vanilla
OR
1/8 tsp peppermint extract

Combine the cocoa, and salt in a big, microwave safe bowl. 
Gradually stir in the milk until smooth.  (PROTIP: this is easiest if you add about 1/2c milk all at once and stir until it's a thick paste, you can add all the rest of the milk and stir it in easily - no lumps.)
Microwave on high for 2min.  Stir.  
Microwave for another 2min.  Stir.  
Microwave for another 2min.  Stir.  
By this point if should be thickening.  Now microwave in 1min increments
Remove from microwave and stir in rum or vanilla or peppermint extract.  Rum is best IMHO.  A lot of the alcohol evaporates when it hits the hot pudding

One easy dish to make is chicken pot pie. And really

Veggies need to be cooked before they go in the pie, either. If you've got a whole cup of peas and only a quarter of a cup of corn, that's fine! Use what you have. I like onions, so I dice and sautee some, and since I've got the frying pan out, I dice up a carrot or two, a stalk of celery and maybe a potato. This is excellent to make at the end of the month when the pantry only has one or two of each thing left.

If you've had a nice, broth or water, throw your softened vegetables and chicken in and pour it in a casserole. If you've not got gravy, make one in the pan where you sauteed your vegetables and you'll get tons of flavor. 

As for the ""pie"" part, this only has to bake long enough to get hot all the way through and finish off your topping.

1

Determine the last expected spring frost date for your area. Plan to plant your russet potatoes about 21 days before that date.

2

Cultivate your planting area to break up any hard soil


3

Mix nitrogen-rich fertilizer into the soil. Apply approximately 3 pounds for every 100 square feet. Water the treated soil and apply organic mulch.


4

Purchase certified russet seed potatoes from your local garden center or nursery. Cut the potatoes into 2- to 4-ounce pieces


5

Plant each potato piece about 3 inches deep with the sprouts pointing up. Space your potato pieces about 12 inches apart


6

Add about 3 more inches of soil once the potato plants start emerging. Apply a layer of organic mulch to help maintain soil temperatures and to prevent weeds from growing.


7

Water your potatoes once or twice a week when the soil feels dry to the touch. Russet potatoes have shallow root systems so they only need a light watering to maintain constant soil moisture.


8

Monitor your russet potato plants for disease and pest problems. Potatoes grown in foggy or moist coastal climates often suffer from late blight


9

Harvest your russet potatoes after the plants have died back. Wet down the soil first to make removing the potatoes easier. Pull out the potatoes by hand for the best results. Store your potatoes in a dark

* Boneless Skinless Chicken Breast (BSCB). 3lb bags are like 7 bucks at Wal-Mart. BOOM. Marinate and tenderize them in Siracha

* Frozen veggies are cheap and easy. Wal-Mart has some packages you can steam in the microwave in 7 minutes. Learn to enjoy broccoli. Brussels Sprouts are pretty damn tasty too. No corn or potatoes

* You don't need milk or juice. If you absolutely require milk

* Canned spinach all day. Really cheap

* Spam. If it was good enough for your grandfather through occupying the Pacific, so sometimes I imagine the pork in my Spam is reuniting with its ancestors.

* KALE KALE KALE KALE KALE. Kale is so important I want to punch you in the mouth. It cures cancer. Eat it. Think you're done? Eat more of it. Kale salad, all kale everything.

* If you're going to be consuming alcohol, I'm a Southern boy so YMMV.

* 1lb cubed Ham
* 1-2 tablespoons chopped Chives

Bake potatoes and set aside to cool. I personally microwave them to save time. While potatoes are baking/cooling, slowly add milk, whisking constantly. When all milk is added, add salt and pepper, and continue heating on medium-low, stirring occasionally until mixture thickens. While waiting on the milk/butter/flour to thicken, cut potatoes into 1/2""-1"" chunks. Add potatoes once mixture has thickened. Add bacon bits, and chives and continue cooking until potatoes have broken down and soup has thickened considerably. Stir in cheese thoroughly and serve.

This is a modified version of one I found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/12mh6p/hangover_soup_potato/). Their version calls for less milk, and serves with sour cream. It tastes fine without it, but the sour cream does add a slight tang if you want that. It also calls for cooking your own bacon, but bacon is getting pretty expensive now and the bacon bits were considerably cheaper for the same effect.

This dish can be a complete vegetarian protein meal on its own

Approximately 2-4 servings as a side dish

1/2 cup White Quinoa    
1/2 cup Red Quinoa    
(or 1 cup White Quinoa)    
2 cups chicken or vegetable broth or bouillon    
3/4 cup frozen peas
3/4 cup canned chick peas    
Salt and fresh ground pepper to taste    
Lemon or lemon juice (optional)     


1) Put broth in a sauce pan and heat to bring it to a boil

2) Rinse the quinoa -- this needs to be done thoroughly to remove the bitter saponin on the surface.  Place the quinoa in a large bowl and fill the it with cold water.  Mix thoroughly until the water is cloudy.  Pour off the water (not all of it or else you will lose a lot of grains as well).  Repeat until the water is clear

3) Place the rinsed quinoa into boiling broth and turn down to simmer for 20-25 minutes (when all or most of the liquid is absorbed).

4) Defrost the peas --  place frozen peas in a bowl and run hot water over them.

5) Add the peas and chickpeas to the hot quinoa while it is still on the stove and stir.

6) Add additional salt and pepper to taste

Variations: This dish can be served cold as a salad, salt and pepper, and add chopped cucumbers and tomatoes. .

Minus the cook time for the rice

**Ingredients**    
1 Tbsp butter    
1/4 cup real maple syrup    
1/2 cup dried cranberries    
2 chicken breasts    
2 cups uncooked brown rice    
6 oz baby spinach (~5 cups)    

**Directions**    
1. Cook rice using your preferred method    
2. Trim and grill chicken. Cut grilled chicken into cubes (~3/4"").     
3. Add butter and maple syrup to a large skillet over medium heat. Add cranberries and cook 1 minute. Add chicken and cook 1 minute. Add spinach and cook until wilted (~2-3 minutes)    
4. In a large mixing bowl

**Substitutions/Alternatives**    
- Use arugula instead of spinach. This adds a little more bitterness to counter the sweetness. You can also do a spinach/arugula mix.   
- You can use white rice instead of brown rice if you prefer that.    
- Wilting the greens is optional. I find that it tastes better but you're free to add them as-is.

It's kind of like a variation on hoppin john that uses breakfast sausage. It's one of those things that goes on sale for super cheap pretty regularly, but at least add some salt for boiling the peas.

1lb black eyed peas 

1lb breakfast sausage (either a tube or individuals)

2-3 tbsp chicken bouillon

cajun seasoning if you like

Let the peas soak for most of the day. I recommend draining them once or twice during the day as the water gets visibly dirty

Start up some boiling water (about 3x the volume of the peas)

Chop up the onion, be careful though as the chicken bouillon adds a lot of salty flavor as well. I found this timing perfect, onions turn translucent right as the sausage is done and absorb all that yummy fat. This took a little less than half an hour for me, if you would rather brown quickly, adjust your bean cooking time accordingly as they require about 2 hours.

**Cauliflower Crust Pizza**

Ingredients:

1 cup cooked

1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

1 egg

1 tsp dried oregano (trivial)

1/2 tsp crushed garlic (trivial)

1/2 tsp garlic salt (trivial)

olive oil (optional) 

pizza sauce

Directions:

To ""Rice"" the Cauliflower:

* Take 1 large head of fresh cauliflower, you can grate the whole head with a cheese grater). Place the riced cauliflower into a microwave safe bowl and microwave for 8 minutes (some microwaves are more powerful than others, so you may need to reduce this cooking time). There is no need to add water, as the natural moisture in the cauliflower is enough to cook itself.
One large head should produce approximately 3 cups of riced cauliflower. The remainder can be used to make additional pizza crusts immediately

To Make the Pizza Crust:

* Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Spray a cookie sheet with non-stick cooking spray.
* In a medium bowl, crushed garlic and garlic salt, stir. 

* Transfer to the cookie sheet

* Bake at 450 degrees for 15 minutes.

* Remove from oven. To the crust

* Place under a broiler at high heat just until cheese is melted (approximately 3-4 minutes).

* Enjoy!

*Note that toppings need to be precooked since you are only broiling for a few minutes.",self,t5_2vvpi,1356747521.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/15lrqm/several_variations_on_pizza_paleo/

If you have a back yard or a sunny area in your house you can put some potted plants in, the oregano and rosemary are almost impossible. We started drying our herbs when we realized that there was more than we could use or give away before it freezes. 

All you need to do is tie it up and hang it upside down from something for a couple of weeks and it should be dried enough to put in containers to be used. The flavor is many times better than anything I've bought dried and it really kicks up your food a few notches. Plus you'll get to eat what you grow.

If you have a back yard I'd encourage you to do this and as an added benefit of the plants,,False,self,t5_2vvpi,False,,True

Bake for 30min in your 400F oven, then toss into the slowcooker with the potatoes and meat. Add a little hot water until you have enough to make a gravy with. Add in your potato flakes until you get a satisfactory consistency.
