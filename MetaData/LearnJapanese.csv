    九 = nine

    鳥 = bird

Voltron the two together into a single kanji and you get 鳩

Now, which, supposedly, is why that radical is used. It's like an encrypted message inside a kanji.

Other examples include:

* 蚊 = mosquito (虫 + 文). Mosquitos make a ""bunn bunnn"" noise

* 鴉 = crow/raven (牙 + 鳥). Crows make a ""gaa gaaa"" sound. The reading of 牙? Of course

* 猫 = (animal radical + 苗). In China, since they made kanji. The reading of 苗 is みょう, which makes a cat the ""myou animal"" (aka the animal that says ""myou"").

[Screenshot with what buttons do](http://i.imgur.com/o1a7DBg.jpg). Incidentally, or look up a Ruby plugin for your favourite browser. This screenshot was in Chrome.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The audio is read by a real person - an NHK announcer in fact. This is a big deal because the Japanese used by NHK is the de facto ""standard Japanese"". The pronunciation and intonation is therefore ""perfect"" by definition. Don't listen to the people who complain that the voice is computer-generated

How best to use it will come down to you and your needs

**Beginner Level:** Look up the words you don't know (furigana helps for this) and try to read along with the speaker. Go over parts that you don't understand and see whether you can make out the meaning. At this point if you can get the general idea of the article I think you're doing pretty good. Optionally

**Upper beginner/lower intermediate:**

* Listening practice: Listen first without looking at the script

* Reading practice: Read through once without looking up any words. You should be able to get at least a vague idea of the meaning. Look up the words you didn't know then read through again. The second or third time through

**Upper Intermediate:**

* Reading: Read through the script. You can probably guess the meaning of words you don't know, click through to the original NHK News Web article and read that. You'll already know what it's about, so it should be pretty straightforward to read. If the easy article is too easy, skip it and go straight to the regular News Web. I also recommend using a browser that doesn't support furigana (or turning off Ruby in your browser settings).

* Listening: As with reading

* Speaking: Since the audio is pretty slow and in NHK Japanese, seeing as you're focussing on pronouncing correctly, not reading), then once more with no script. Over time this will help you to get better at pronouncing and intonating well in standard Japanese.

**Advanced:**

* Shadowing: See above point. This is the major benefit of News Web Easy for advanced learners

* Reading and Listening practice: Just go to the main News Web. Even better

1344748027.0,y2yon,I learned almost 300 Kanji in 5 weeks. After being VERY behind in my Kanji knowledge I feel incredible and want to share with everyone how I did it. ,spaghettisburg,105,14,60,"I have been studying Japanese for about 5 years and I have always been behind in my kanji. I read so many opinions on how to improve my knowledge and nothing seemed to be working for me. Finally

I used a 1,2,3,1,2,3,4 method where I would look up the first one repeat it out-loud, go back to the first etc. (I hope that makes sense.) I then wrote down all the ones I wanted to learn and decided on learning 8 a day. I would look them all up during my break at lunch time. Then go back to them 15 minutes later

Then, or looked cool along the way I would look up immediately. Then I would count them up again. I can't believe how much I have improved.

There was always a few problems I ran into with kanji that stopped me from studying them properly. 

1.) I always tried to study at the end of the day

2.) People always told me to learn kanji in compounds, each kanji pronunciation, the meaning of them together, and the pronunciation of them together. This might work for some people, but for me it was overwhelming. 

3.) Everyone recommended Anki, I was too tired. Plus I feel like writing them down, and having to look at them in your own writing helps jog your memory sometimes. 

My tips for studying kanji: First of all, find a time of day when you are fresh and your brain wants to work. Third, review as much as you can, whenever you have time. Another thing is to make up some stories! I heard RTK helps you do this but I never used it. After you have a base knowledge of the first 200 or so you can do it easily I think. Finally, find a partner, or someone you can be accountable to, I have even taken to posting how many I know on Facebook

TL;DR: I am proud of myself for finally finding a way to learn kanji that works for me. Here is my (probably useless) instructions on how I did it. Sorry to waste your time!!",,t5_2qyls,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/y2yon/i_learned_almost_300_kanji_in_5_weeks_after_being/
1370422917.0,1fpmc6,Feynman on Japanese,,109,20,123,"&gt; After visiting a number of universities I spent some months at the
Yukawa Institute in Kyoto. I really enjoyed working there. Everything was so
nice: You'd come to work
serve you tea in the morning when you felt like it. It was very pleasant.


&gt;While in Kyoto I tried to learn Japanese with a vengeance. I worked
much harder at it
do things. I took lessons from a Japanese man every day for an hour.


&gt;One day he was teaching me the word for ""see.""


&gt;""All right
do you say?""


&gt; I made up a sentence with the word that I had just learned.


&gt;""No
garden? you use the first 'see.' But when you want to see someone else's
garden

&gt;""Would you like to glance at my lousy garden?"" is essentially what
you're saying in the first case
fella's garden
garden?"" So there's two different words you have to use.

&gt;Then he gave me another one: ""You go to a temple
at the gardens...""

&gt;I made up a sentence


&gt;""No
So you have to say something that would be equivalent to 'May I hang my eyes
on your most exquisite gardens?'

&gt; Three or four different words for one idea
it's miserable; when you're doing it


&gt;I was learning Japanese mainly for technical things
check if this same problem existed among the scientists.

&gt;At the institute the next day
would I say in Japanese


&gt;They said such-and-so.


&gt;""OK. Now I want to say
I say that?""

&gt; ""Well

&gt; ""Why?"" I protested. ""When I solve it
you solve it!""

&gt; ""Well

&gt;I gave up. I decided that wasn't the language for me

1366050956.0,1cekmm,I wrote this email to a friend asking how I got fluent in Japanese,TofuTofu,116,40,49,"**EDIT: To be clear

I hear ya. To get to real fluency you need to make a big commitment. Here is what genuinely worked for me. A lot of it you probably can't do because I was a student and had some freedom

---

**Stuff I did that you probably don't have time for:**

1- I took college classes. They are really

2- I studied abroad in Japan for a year. That was how I got from functional understanding to true conversational fluency. Are there Brazilian bars, soccer leagues, etc in Boston? If so, go join them ASAP and make a bunch of friends who primarily speak Portuguese to each other. Nothing will replace you being around and interacting with native speakers as much as possible.

---

**Stuff I did on my own that was critical:**

1- Translate a fuck-ton of stuff. I learned to love it and did it as a hobby. I got really into translating Japanese song lyrics and TV shows especially. Your early translations will suck but **there is no better way to learn a bunch of vocabulary than by translating things.** You want to find a peer group of like-minded people to share your translations with so you can learn from one another. I am sure there are great communities for such things. Check [viki.com](http://viki.com). Also look for Youtube channels. When guys talk about their ""10

2- Start blogging in shitty portuguese ASAP. Make internet friends. I used to do this on a Japanese site called mixi but I know there are humongous Brazilian communities online. Check Orkut and other places. I used to use these social networks for making friends, and of course meeting and fucking chicks. I probably fucked 30 Japanese girls from mixi. They probably have meetups and parties in Boston all the time, dude. Seek that shit out.

3- Consume media in your free time. Watch TV, listen to music. Learn to love it. Absorb that shit by osmosis. Learn about their pop culture. Language is heavily influenced by pop culture. Watch their shitty morning TV shows on Youtube or wherever they get posted online.

4- Make an active effort to use every new grammar pattern &amp; word you learn the same day you learn it. Work it into conversation or a blog post. Try to use it 3 or more times if possible. This is a lot easier when you're living in the country and can go to a bar and talk to strangers

5- Make friends who speak the language. Get some Brazilian girlfriends who will watch shitty Portuguese TV shows and movies with you and can explain things you don't understand.

6- Travel to the country. There is no way to fake this. I went to Japan about 15 times between 2002 and 2011.

---

There are really 3 things you need to study to reach real fluency:

**Grammar:** The only way to learn is brute force. Get yourself some good textbooks and study the grammar patterns until you master them. Use them every single day. If you don't understand something

**Vocabulary:** Translation &amp; media consumption are your friends here. You cannot memorize vocabulary from a book

**Cultural references:** Media consumption &amp; interaction with natives. They are open to sharing their culture with you

Expect to make a real commitment if you want to reach fluency. The beauty of it is,000 hours in, dude.",,False,,t5_2qyls,,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1cekmm/i_wrote_this_email_to_a_friend_asking_how_i_got/

1. Each column of かな represents a different verb stem ending and each column serves its own purpose as can be seen here ---&gt;
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/AMB_Japanese_Verbs.pdf/page1-800px-AMB_Japanese_Verbs.pdf.jpg

2. There is no such thing as て form
食べ ＋ て = 食べて ////
泳ぎ＋で ＝泳いで

3. Potential form is once again the stem form (連用形) joined to the verb ~える (which means to acquire). Basically you do the action and acquire… I dunno… the results.
泳ぎ+ える = 泳げる

4. Similarly
ころす ころさ + える  殺される

5. Again

飲む ――＞ のま ＋ させる ――＞ 飲ませる ////
食べ ＋ させる ＝食べさせる

6. Xみたいだ is not a grammatical point that stemmed from 見たい but rather emerged form Ｘを見たようだ. It too was slurred and became みたいだ That is why is has the same meaning as のようだ but is more casual.

I have been learning Japanese for the past two years in my own spare time and have had a rekindling interest in manga and anime. Because of this

What I would like to do is begin with an easy to read beginner book with available English translations to check against. Over time and if people are interested

Another thing to support translations and gain interest would be to reward those who participate. Whoever does the most translations, etc. could receive a prize.

For example, I would allow the participants to decide the goals that need to be met for translations so no one feels they are being cheated.

For people that do not have access to the raw books / Japanese versions

The reason for this idea is that there are so many untranslated projects and I alone can not manage to translate them all. So many projects have been dropped and I have wanted a new translation team to pick them up or an official English release. But with a team of people that want to learn the language, and other media that has gone untranslated.

It says ""check the FAQ"" in big letters for a reason.  **Clarification**: this does not apply to actual questions about Japanese at *any* level
* Translation requests will be removed
* **Put your question in the post title**.  Titles like ""A quick question"" or ""Grammar help"" are amazingly uninformative.
* Please consider the level of a question before you attempt to answer.  Comments like ""I'm a total beginner, similar questions, and even ""Oh, I was wondering about that, too"" are fine; random guesses are not.  One of the biggest criticisms of this sub is the lack of actual qualified Japanese instructors; please don't make it worse by making things up.

Seeing as /r/LearnJapanese recently passed 10 000 subscribers

In my experience there are primarily three types of posts that show up here that I feel do not fit the subreddit:

**Firstly, learning Japanese). Examples (and these are just from the current front page):

* http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1299bf/using_wikipedia_in_japanese/
* http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1264lp/so_while_studying_japanese_using_obenkyo_for/

**Secondly, if any, intent on actually studying the language themself.** This can include posts asking for someone to translate Japanese without the poster providing their own attempt and thoughts, intent on getting free translation service. I have nothing against the concept of free translation service, but there are more appropriate subreddits. This also includes people trying to get others to do their homework for them, or people asking how to obtain Japanese media for purposes other than studying.

Examples:

* http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/10l44s/can_anyone_help_translate_this/
* http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/102v73/what_does_ハイスイノナサmean_in_english_its_an_awesome/

* http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/104pc5/place_to_watch_japanese_moviesdramas_mine_died/

**Thirdly, however, like to stress the fact that this is not /r/AskReddit. If you are, for example, looking for advice when going to Japan for the first time, ""I'm going to Japan for the first time, anything I need to keep in mind when it comes to approaching people?"" is a better post title than ""Please share your funny encounters with Japanese natives!"". Examples:

* http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/11bjkk/i_just_read_something_in_hirigana_it_made_me_so/
* http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/ycm0m/whats_the_most_embarrassingfunny_thing_you_have/

Here's the synopsis from Amazon:

&gt;Absolutely hilarious and educational book. Best seller in Japan. ""The Japanese the Japanese Don't Know"" is a collection of stories about a teacher of Japanese in Japan and her students, etc. There's also a lot of interesting background on the Japanese language, like where certain words came from and such. For example, masu/desu is now standard Japanese, but it used to be geisha-speak. Men came to the capital, heard geisha speaking that way, and took it home and spread it, and how even Japanese people get it wrong a lot. Highly recommended for intermediate/advanced Japanese students. All kanji with furigana reading.

If you're interested I'll be uploading the chapters here as I finish them: http://kalenxi.smugmug.com/Translations/NihonjinNoShiranaiNihongo1

An example: http://www.amazon.com/makotochan-no-yugaku-Japanese-ebook/dp/B00A28GUI6/

Unfortunately you'll need a special supported device which means an Android, paperwhite). PC apps aren't supported it seems.

The experience from the Android app:

* Built-in Japanese-Japanese dictionary
* The android version seems to lack dictionary search in the Japanese dictionary
* Appears to be no furigana marks
* When looking up non-conjugated words
* When looking up conjugated words (such as verbs) the dictionary doesn't work.
* Can't seem to copy selected text
* Included font is very readable/scalable (unlike kobo reader app)

Honestly the dictionary issues make this a tough one for learners. I've been waiting for an ebook reading experience in Japanese but not being able to copy text or easily lookup conjugated verbs/adjectives in the app is really disappointing. I wish there was either a way to tell it the dictionary form (I can usually guess) or to partial searches in the dictionary. The dictionary itself is just an ebook you can actually flip through but the order is by reading so you can't just look up a kanji and expect to find all words using that kanji on subsequent pages.

1346674822.0,z9zox,JLPT techniques--tricks and knacks for improving your score,wonkydonky,64,13,31,"Since we all just got our JLPT scores (or are about to get them)

The JLPT, does not actually measure your Japanese proficiency.  What it measures is your ability to study for the JLPT.  Thus, knowing the tests, and having a good study plan can make it *far* more easier than not.  Furthermore, there are two sections in particular that measure your test-taking abilities and *not* your Japanese proficiency, meaning that even native speakers might fail those two portions if they don't understand what is being asked.

Section one: The word order section.  Sample questions from this section look something like this:

&gt;昨日渋谷に＿＿＿ ＿＿＿＿ ＿＿★＿＿ ＿＿＿＿ 大変でした。

&gt;１）ので ２）にも ３）行けなかった ４）行こう

And then you have to write the number of the corresponding word that goes in the starred blank.

Upon first glance, ""how to properly form Japanese sentences in normal word order.""

So, ""do I see any grammatical patterns from the study guide that can be made out of these blank words, and possibly the words next to the blanks?""  If you studied the pattern VようにもVれない, then you will see the words 行こう （よう form of行く), にも, and 行けなかった (past form of 行けない).  Once you see those three, you know this question is asking for the VようにもVれない pattern.  So you hook those three words up together. 行こうにも行けなかった.  So then we only have one more blank word to put in, and it only makes sense in the fourth blank

So to recap

1. Scan the blank words

2. Fill in the blanks with that grammatical pattern.

3. There will only be one (maybe two) blanks which are left after the grammatical pattern has been written.

4. Fill in the remaining blanks in the only logical way.

5. Write down the number of the corresponding word for the starred blank.

Note: Be careful about some grammatical patterns where the last word may be filled in in the *inside* of the pattern.

So how do you prepare for these sections?  The answer is easy, including how it is linked to the surrounding words.  If you want to be thorough, then you can also use どんなときどう使う日本語表現文法辞典, however just 完全マスター should be sufficient.

(Note: My source for the information in this part is my Japanese professor this last semester who used to be a question-writer and question-evaluator for JLPT.  Kanzen master is his recommendation

Section two: Listening comprehension (almost all of it)

Listening comprehension should really be called ""note-taking ability""

&gt;1: Did you do B yesterday?

&gt;2: No

&gt;1: What about A or D?

&gt;2: I did neither A nor D.

&gt;1: Well what about C?

&gt;2: You got me, I mean the first thing you asked me about.

or perhaps

&gt;1: Hey is this your phone number?

&gt;2: Let me see that.

&gt;2: Oh

&gt;1: Oh

&gt;2: Yeah

&gt;1: Oh

&gt;2: Just like that!

While a bit of an exaggeration, if you think you clearly hear them say, ""Oh yes, I did D,"" then it is almost a given that D is not the answer, and that they will later in the dialogue say ""Woops! I was joking about before!"".  So, how do you do this?  The answer is with taking notes.  When they say something, Japanese, your mother language, between a brother and a sister:

&gt;B-did go to store?

&gt;S-no

&gt;B-You mean that school?

&gt;S-No

Something like that will be fine.  And even if you don't read the notes when you answer

I know why you're here. You're worried that you're not going to make it. That you're going to fail at learning Japanese and all of your effort will be wasted. You don't know what to do and there's nobody to guide you. And it's not that you don't care enough to find what to do

These doubts are a good thing.

For all that they make you feel like crap, sentences, and lists of words with no end in sight. How can you possibly know that any of this is working; that you're on the right path and headed for the finish line?

Learning Japanese has no final goal line. There's no point at which you cross some mystical finish line and suddenly cheering crowds appear to present you with a plaque that says “JAPANESE MASTER.” While it sounds ridiculous, but in reality we ignore the true signs of progress.

If you have an immersion environment, songs, shows, whatever. These are the signs of progress. If you're wondering if you're on the “right” path, if you're doing things “right,” then just pay attention to what you do each day. Do you read manga? Watch anime? Browse articles on the Japanese Wikipedia page? Sing along with J-Pop? Whatever it is you're doing, realize that you're doing it in Japanese. You're reading in Japanese. You're listening to a song and understanding the lyrics. Well guess what...

That IS the end goal! You've done it! Look at you! Immersed in Japanese and understanding so easily that you forget how absolutely amazing you are!! Learning Japanese can be so sneaky in the way that it happens; it's incredibly easy to forget how much progress we've made. So remind yourself. If you're feeling these doubts

Take the next step.

When you're feeling this way, be it a children's story, a manga for teens, or a tome on organic chemistry, and understand it - that is learning Japanese. You've done it. If you can read even one sentence, one word, one kana, word

So if you're feeling worried about your progress

There's three main divisions of kanji

    象形文字（しょうけいもじ）
    表意文字（ひょういもじ）
    表音文字（ひょうおんもじ）


The first, 目、木、月 are all 象形文字。Most radicals are directly related to a 象形文字, and borrow ideographic content from the original kanji.  These need to be memorized, there's maybe not even 200 of these.

The second, but for our purposes, this is as good as a 表意文字。These also need to be memorized, there's probably less than 100 of these.  

The most significant is this last group... 

表音文字 make up the vast majority of Kanji in Japanese

In a 表音文字、there's two main parts to the kanji:  a part that donates a sound to the character, to divide 表 into 士 and 衣 is fairly meaningless, because 表 has a sound all it's own to it.  Functionally, you shouldn't be mentally dividing 表 into 土 and 衣 every time you see it, that's a waste of time.  

However

In this case

There are a number of 'main' radicals that most kanji fall under, the 主な部首 provides the semantic content of the kanji, and the other half provides phonetic component.  Now, to a native English speaker, these are *both technically radicals*, but native Japanese people make mental distinctions between these two types of radicals automatically.  

By understanding what kind of radicals provide sounds and what kind of radicals provide semantic content, as pointed out in an earlier thread.  The phonetic component is 将, and the the semantic component is 酉, or 日読みの酉（ひよみのとり）.  To prove how versatile this system is, 奨 and 蒋 are also read しょう。

Now, it's not a character that exists by itself in the wild.  But, if I asked you if you could read 轍, てつ is a very logical guess-- and you'd be right.  The meaning can be attached later, but once this kanji is mentally attached to 撤 and 徹, remembering the meaning of 轍 with the semantic component of 車is actually pretty easy.  

This isn't terribly different from the kind of storytelling that Heisig suggests doing.  However, there's no real need to make up stories in search of a mnemonic device, they have them built in.  ",,False,,t5_2qyls,,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/ny74z/radicals_and_what_they_mean/

--Methodology--

I believe we can all agree that a huge chunk of fluency in a language is immersion. Being surrounded by a language helps you derive mental connections and emotions to words

In my mind

When we were infants

Immersion is the key. I feel that many traditional classes do not have the time to spare on immersion because 1) people wouldn't pay to be shown Youtube clips they can find on their own 2) it is nearly impossible to test knowledge on something as abstract as general understanding. 

This is where my University of Reddit class comes in.

--Class Setup--

The class will consist of daily 5 to 10-minute clips from shows, etc. that will include Japanese subtitles, furigana, and a community dictionary. Dual English subtitles will be optional with Japanese subtitles on bottom, and English ones on top.

The part I am most excited about is gathering suggestions from Students and TAs. This means we can all contribute to the collective immersion process and vote on what we'd like to see the next day or week. We could also choose weekly themes or cover certain subjects depending on community input.

There is an optional grading process we can do if you want to keep yourself engaged. After each clip there is the option to answer a 10-question fill in the blank quiz. We'll take random lines from the clip

TAs would be asked to help transcribe clips

I will not teach in the traditional sense of explaining the grammar or vocabulary behind each sentence. Rather, as well as improve class organization with your suggestions.

1351914543.0,12jtxz,FAQ,Aurigarion,50,4,17,"/r/LearnJapanese FAQ ver. 2.0 (仮):

This FAQ is broken down into ~~two~~ three parts (internal links to come with wiki...eventaully):

* New to Japanese
* New to /r/LearnJapanese
* EDIT: Resources/links (coming with the wiki version

---

**New to Japanese:**

1. **Q:** I'm totally new to Japanese; where should I start?
  
  **A:** Right here, if there's one thing you take away from this entire FAQ, it should be that **learning Japanese is like learning any other foreign language, and requires hard work and persistence.**

2. **Q:** OK

  **A:** That all depends on you.  When you're creating a study plan, and what study methods you find effective.  Many people like [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) for flashcards, and a lot of decks are available (or you can make your own).  [Genki](http://www.amazon.com/GENKI-Integrated-Elementary-Japanese-Edition/dp/4789014401/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351911595&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=genki) is a highly-recommended textbook series.  (A more comprehensive list of resources will be included in the wiki version of this FAQ, whenever the wiki actually exists.)

3. **Q:** This sounds like...work.  Do I *really* need to do all of that?  Can't I just practice with anime/manga/video games?

  **A:** Yes, you cannot *just* practice with manga/anime/games.  They're completely valid reasons for wanting to learn Japanese, and they're a fun way to practice what you've learned, but they're not study materials.  If you want to learn Japanese, you will need to spend time focusing on studying.

  The US State Department lists Japanese as one of only five ""Superhard"" languages: the hardest foreign languages for native English speakers to learn ([PDF](http://fsitraining.state.gov/training/Language_Toolkit.pdf)

4. **Q:** Holy crap there are a lot of kanji.  Do I need to learn them all before I can even start studying?

  Alternatively: When should I start learning kanji?

  **A:** This question always sparks lengthy debates, or similar.  You do **not** need to learn them all (or any of them) before starting.

  Also

5. **Q:** But I went ahead and memorized 1200 kanji; how far along am I?

  **A:** If you learned *only* kanji, and take the time to practice using them in context.

6. **Q:** How do I type in Japanese like all the cool kids?

  **A:** It depends on your operating system

7. **Q:** What's this JLPT I keep hearing about?  Should I take it?

  **A:** The [Japanese Language Proficiency Test](http://www.jlpt.jp/e/) is an annual (or bi-annual, as it lacks speaking and writing components, and it's pretty easy to do well on the test just by studying the JLPT itself instead of actually learning Japanese.  Despite what you might hear, N1 (the highest level) is not strictly necessary to get a job in Japan; whether or not an employer will want it depends on your industry and the individual company.  That said, there's no harm in taking it if you feel like it.

---

**New to /r/LearnJapanese:**

1. **Q:** What sort of things can I ask here?

  **A:** You can ask anything related to learning Japanese.  Specific questions, correct answer, people come here for a chance to talk to other Japanese learners, so anything which people find helpful is generally allowed.

  Memes/image macros will be allowed if they actively help people practice or learn, ""people were discussing Japanese in the comments, so it totally counts"" is not a valid argument, no matter how funny you think your meme is.

2. **Q:** Can I ask for help with my homework?

  **A:** Did you ask your teacher first?

  If you're having trouble understanding a concept and want to hear some different explanations

  You should also check your school's/class's Academic Honesty policy before asking for help.  You *really* don't want to be the next kid whose professor is also on reddit and caught them cheating.

3. **Q:** How can I be sure I'm getting an accurate answer?

  **A:** You can't.  This is /r/LearnJapanese, and check out any resources people provide.

4. **Q:** Are translation requests accepted?  I'm not really interested in learning Japanese

  **A:** You can post a translation request, so a lot of people will ignore them.

1374683049.0,1iypky,[META] Tips on teaching languages (and learning them too!),Aurigarion,51,7,6,"This topic tends to come up in comment discussions a bit

Full disclosure: I am not a professional educator.  I've taught Hebrew at Hebrew schools, and to see if we can figure out some guidelines to help everyone out.

---

Tips for teaching:

* **Consider the level of the OP when answering.**  If the OP is asking a basic grammar question
* **Don't lose sight of the original question.**  Side-conversations in the comments are fine
* **You are here to help, or subtle regional differences, or anything like that.
* **The most important thing is that the OP understands the answer**.  No explanation needed.

----

Tips for learning:

* **Ask good questions**.  Provide context
* **Don't be afraid to try on your own**.  Include your own guess
* **Sometimes it's better to leave a question for later**.  It sucks, but ""don't worry about it for now"" is often good advice.

His accent was really bad and I didn't really know what he was saying at first
I said ""uh no its just I didn't quite hear you"" trying to be polite. He then repeats ""a-zu-ki wa doko e?"" so this time I responded with ""小豆ですか こちらにあります。” quite quickly.

I recently released a flashcard program for Japanese called Let's Learn Japanese: Deluxe. The purpose of this program is to make it easy for those wanting to learn or already studying to have a simple and effective way to study and memorize characters.

Let's Learn Japanese; Deluxe
http://gzstorm.com/lets-learn-japanese-deluxe/

If you've used programs like Anki or Mnemosyne before

For instance, Grade 1-S Kanji, and 1700 common words are included with the program, no additional download required. Every section is broken up into categories for easier learning. Every character and word also has animated stroke order, words can be broken down by Kanji ( http://gzstorm.com/screen/LLJD_Kanji0.png ), there is a quiz mode to test retention, a review mode for all information included

The program costs $1 to buy, Grade 1-3 Kanji, and 250 words. This program is also available on your XBOX 360 as well as PC.

I realize that this is my first post and it's talking about a program I made, but are not tailored for the Japanese language and require set-up on the users part. This is an all inclusive program, and I feel a lot of people could benefit from using even the demo version as it contains the most vital and basic information needed to get started.

The commenter continues...

「やったね(笑）そのユーモア精神大好きですだよ！それで、旦那くんが元気になるように心より祈ってます。」

Her comment on this line is that 「大好きですだよ」is really odd Japanese.

The comment was gushing and positive

1. It's a dialect she's not familiar with

2. It's a foreigner making awkward mistakes in Japanese

Either way I told her to be forgiving to the person as they were being nice

http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1at62c/inferring_readings_of_individual_kanji/

I used the information to finish my project of quantitatively analyzing the kanji readings in my sentence deck

Each sentence has a kana transcription and an audio recording against which the transcription may be compared in cases where the kana seem incorrect. Many errors in the transcriptions were identified and corrected during this project. But it is likely that some errors remain

Here are the basic numbers:

    9799   total sentences
    1974   distinct kanji
    45858  total kanji readings
    3758   distinct kanji readings

It is interesting that the average number of distinct readings per kanji is less than 2. I originally started this project because I wanted to make some flash cards to isolate distinct readings of each kanji. I keep getting frustrated when I have to fail a sentence card because it contains an unfamiliar reading of a kanji I have already seen a bunch of times. Also, and it's easy to get caught up in the ones which have many. It's one of those cases where you remember the hard cases more than the easy ones, so you get a skewed sense for how many distinct readings there really are.

Here is a summary of the distribution of unique readings for kanji. In other words

    Readings       Number of Kanji
    1                 956
    2                 570
    3                 270
    4                 108
    5                 43
    6                 15
    7                 5
    8                 3
    9                 3
    11                1
    18                1

These are the reading types recorded:

    on -- an on reading listed in Kanjidic2
    kun -- a kun reading listed in Kanjidic2
    nanori -- a nanori reading in Kanjidic2 not already listed as on or kun
    rendaku -- a vocalized version of one of the Kanjidic readings (e.g. か -&gt; が)
    elision -- a shortened version of one of the Kanjidic readings (e.g. カク -&gt; カッ when in front of キ)
    jukujikun -- a kanji compound whose reading is assigned to the word as a whole rather than the individual kanji

I added 36 variant kun readings to the Kanjidic data to cover cases that seemed like relatively obvious variants on existing readings. Many of these cases involve variants on okurigana usage.

The statistics for nanori, because some kanji have rendaku-ized and shortened readings already listed as readings, and some don't. If a kanji already has a rendaku-ized reading listed as an on reading, kun reading, or nanori reading, it isn't counted as rendaku, and similarly for elision. If a kanji uses a nanori reading, but it was listed as a nanori reading.

Also, or a final ん is dropped before the next syllable. I hope the example above makes clear what I'm talking about. If someone knows the correct name for this, I would be interested to know.

Finally, and besides that it isn't totally clear what would count as an authority to settle the question definitively.

Here is a summary of the reading types. Overall on readings are the most common

    Type       Distinct  Total
    on         1760      25062
    kun        1503      17870
    jukujikun  134       970
    rendaku    213       964
    elision    87        550
    nanori     61        442

The real problem with Kanji isn't the number of characters there are (an average 太郎 can get by with about 2000), and form a concept map that includes how compounds are related to each other.  Without this

The activity I am about to propose is something that Japanese schoolkids actually do in *their own classrooms* to improve compound accessibility.  It is an adaptation of shiritori

For instance

りんご⇒ゴリラ⇒ラッキー⇒きのこ⇒こぶた etc.

One might make the game more complicated by limiting the game to a particular class of objects

In the Kanji version

青春⇒春季⇒季節⇒節電⇒電車⇒ etc.  

Using this game, and furthermore, begin to associate compounds with each other, an extremely valuable resource when trying to explain something in simpler terms (something you will undoubtedly have to do if trying to express something outside of your comfort zone).

Please post comments on this game directly to the OP

*****
### Immersion:

- [All Japanese All The Time](http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/about)

- [LiveMocha](http://www.livemocha.com/) is an online language learning tool, but for ineffectiveness and inefficiency. It has good vocabulary and presentation, but I see it as a very slow learning tool, and not forgetting the *pricey price*. There are some people who've had wonders with Rosetta Stone, so it all comes back to personal preference.

- [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/), PV (Promotional Video) or a TV Show, it is a great fun way to learn and play.

- [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/) is a very nice source for Japanese Podcasts which you can listen to anytime and anywhere. There are both free and commercial podcasts

- [JapanesePod101](http://www.japanesepod101.com/) is a website on Japanese podcasts, so nothing to lose here.
*****
### Vocabulary/SRS:

- [Smart.fm](http://smart.fm/home)

- [Anki](http://ichi2.net/anki/) is similar to Smart.fm in a way (except it isn't web-based), so it's all a matter of preference. *[A good read on the comparison between Anki &amp; Smart.fm](http://yonasu.com/anki-vs-smartfm/)*
*****
### Live Video Learning:

- [EduFire](http://edufire.com/) is what comes to my mind for learning online with a teacher. There are free courses
*****
###Grammar:

- [TextFugu](http://www.textfugu.com/) is an Online Japanese Textbook which is a choice for those going for self teaching themselves. I personally use this

- [Tae Kim's Guide to Learning Japanese](http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar) - Informative and straightforward from beginner to anywhere advanced

- [JGram](http://jgram.org/) is another Japanese Grammar site. I've never used this one before
*****
###Kana:

- [RealKana](http://www.realkana.com/)
*****
###Kanji:

- [Remembering The Kanji](http://kanji.koohii.com/) is a method created by James Heisig. In the first book, which he believes should be separated and learnt in Volume II. If this works for you, then use it. If it doesn't, there are other alternatives. All comes back to preference.

- [Kanji Damage](http://www.hellodamage.com/top/kanjidamage/)

- [Read The Kanji](http://www.readthekanji.com/), but it is awesome. There is a free trial that includes JLPT level 4, and I think hiragana and katakana.""` I've only opened this site once, but it has a nice presentation, hopefully has great content too.
*****
###Miscellaneous:

- [Zonjineko](http://www.zonjineko.com/)

- [Tofugu](http://www.tofugu.com/)

- [SpaceAlc](http://www.alc.co.jp/), but it seems useful for intermediate learners.

Which brings us to this week's kotowaza: 風が吹けば桶屋が儲かる。(When the wind blows

The seven step explanation is this:

* The wind blows dirt and dust into the air.
* The dust gets into people's eyes
* The increase in blind people leads to an increase in demand for shamisen (Playing shamisen was a traditional job of the blind) 
* The increase in shamisen demand leads to more cats being killed. (Cat skin was once used in the making of shamisen.)
* The decrease in the cat population leads to an increase in rats.
* The rats chew on the wooden barrels.
* This leads to increased demand for new barrels and the coopers profit.

**冬の使者の訪れ**

木枯らし（こがらし）

秋の終わりから、冬の初めにかけて吹く強い風のことで、木を枯らしてしまう風という意味です。

また、「木嵐（こあらし）」が語源だという説もあります。

「嵐」の語源は「荒し」。「し」は風を意味する古語ですから、荒い風という意味です。でも、中国では「嵐」という漢字は、山にただよう気配のことで、荒々しい風という意味はないそうです。

「凩（こがらし）」という漢字もありますが、これは、日本で考え出された漢字、つまり国字です。

風に関する国字は、他にも颪（おろし）、凪（なぎ）、凧（たこ）などがあります。

First of all
I posted the video before
things and it was fantastic.  You all motivated me to study basically non 
stop for the past 2 weeks.

I just got done [sending out](http://flic.kr/p/bnHCHA) 49 mosaics for everyone who has asked over the 
past 12 days.  ([First six pictures in this set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tommythecorc/sets/72157629066712362/)) For those of you keeping track at home
means I wrote 13
studying ever.  Before making the video
year, I 
busted out 12 straight best-study days.  And that included an 宴会 and 
subsequent 二日酔い, you 
can't ever pass up an opportunity to go to an 宴会.

Second of all
months to complete so I posted on the video description that I wouldn't be 
taking any more requests
anticipated
of these kanji mosaics.  If you watched it before and thought to yourself 
""I don't want to bother this guy.""  Don't worry!  This has nothing to do 
with taking time
and all I need is motivation.

However
don't have to wait too long.  Plus after about 50 e-mails my inbox becomes 
a little cluttered and it gets slightly overwhelming.  I am guessing if I 
get 50 requests
a month or so.

Obviously if I get the same response as last time
mosaic for everyone who wants one.  And if more than 50 people want one
then I will post again probably in early April or whenever I finish the 
second batch.  

Please don't hesitate to ask
need.  I'm shooting for the JLPT level 2 in July and I still have a long 
ways to go
confident that I'll pass.

**tl;dr** If you want your name written in 330 Kanji
description.  I can't really organize my reddit inbox very well so please send me an e-mail instead of a reddit message.

ps.  First 10 people to e-mail me with a request get a [Big Thunder chocolate bar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Thunder_%28chocolate_bar%29#Big_Thunder) included in the envelope.  So even though when you 
get the mosaic and are disappointed in my terrible handwriting
least enjoy some delicious Japanese chocolate.  This offer is only valid 
for people outside of Japan
nearest conbini.

pps. Don't be a jerk if you e-mail me.  If you just say ""WRITE ME 1 OMG

Here's what I know I needed to understand better-
• I had learned a phrase for ""Are you ready to order?"" but only heard it a select few times

• When ordering

• When given your food, do you say ”ごちそうさま"" to anyone at the restaurant helping you/checking you out? I only know of these phrases being used in more personal settings/to those you are eating with and wasn't sure if it's used beyond that.

• どうも actually seemed rare on it's own- why is ありがとう so much more prevalent? Is it actually a bit rude to say どうも only in a more formal setting as it's not as thankful? Is it normal to say どうもありがとうございました at the end of a transaction or is this overly polite as the customer?

• The first time I used the word I learned for bill or check

• ""Do you want a plastic bag?"" What is said in this case

• I used 大丈夫 very often and was not sure if it really is the exact equivalent to ""OK"" and ""that's alright"" in English. Let's say someone is pushing you to buy more items in their shop- is ""大丈夫"" an appropriate answer or is ""けっこです。"" the more sensible choice? If someone is being overly polite and apologizing when there is no need


I was wondering also if there are any good source for learning common food dishes/kanji? I'm pretty lacking in kanji but this would be an area I'd love to focus on since I'm really into Japanese food back home

He wrote all the stories behind the Yakuza (竜がごとく)PS games and, drugs, gangs, violence. You know, the spice of life! His writing style is fairly straight forward, with flowery descriptions but nothing rediculous, and VERY realistic dialogue which should help my fellow learners get a greater feel for how slang in Japanese works. The novels I have are: ダークマーン [darkman] and 不夜城 [sleepless town] or I have 闇のよぶ声 by 遠藤周作 and 陸中海岸殺意の族 by 西村京太郎 all pretty much dealing with mayhem and are not the typical ""I, but I find the monotony of japanese life makes the most uninteresting stories imaginable.)

So I am about to finish University in Scotland (LLB Law) and decided I wanted to go to Japan and learn Japanese (currently beginner level) with the intention of eventually getting a job there. I have looked at several options online for this each coming in at around £5000 for a 3 month beginners course. Are there cheaper options or is this pretty much the norm? If that is the case any grants/funding people have used?

I would also be interested in feedback from people who attended any of the schools for learning Japanese such as The Yamasa Institute

There is also the possibility I would be able to get a job out there immediately through connections I already have (english speaking)

It's really one of the best explanations I've ever seen of how the JLPT works and how useful/practical it is.

&gt; Outside of the Vocab/Grammar section's letter grades it is impossible to know based on your score how many questions you got right/wrong. So you can't really say

&gt; The new test scoring method is not a flat Questions Right/Questions Wrong calculation. They're using a test scoring strategy called Item Response Theory that curves the value of each individual question based on how many people got them right or got them wrong. Fewer people getting a question right makes that question worth more points.

&gt; This is why in the Vocab/Grammar section they also give you letter grades that do correspond to that flat score.

&gt; Instead of comparing your performance to only the test directly

&gt; The reason they moved to this model was to make test scores more comparable between sessions. By taking into account data about how hard certain questions there's more of a buffer between a really easy test or a really hard test having an impact on the number of people that pass.

&gt; There's a long explanation of it with a lot of graphs here: http://www.jlpt.jp/e/about/pdf/scaledscore_e.pdf

&gt; We are still seeing some swings in the pass rate between the December(35%) and July(45%) test. I think that has more to do with fewer people outside of Japan taking that July test. People living in Japan already tend to have an easier time with the test

&gt; Also, but with just a different piece of paper. Maybe your conversation skills are amazing so it might have gotten you an interview for a job you wouldn't have gotten before...maybe.

&gt; The JLPT certification doesn't actually open up that many doors. JLPT1 only represents around a high school level of literacy. It doesn't test speaking/writing at all. Even after having passed the test

&gt; So even if all of you had passed １級 back then you'd still be in the same boat of trying to move forward with the language. It's not like you could have just called it a life and stopped studying. The JLPT is a stepping-stone on the way to fluency. It's not an end goal by itself unless you have a very specific work-related need for having only that level of Japanese and no further.",,t5_2qyls,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/zf63v/this_is_the_best_post_ive_ever_seen_explaining/

As most of you know, and a common complaint about it seems to be that the method forces you to learn a great number of kanji that are rarely used or otherwise fairly useless, in order to get to more common kanji later in the set. This got me thinking about the way RTK works and how it could be optimized.

I probably don't have to explain this to most of you, and this helps with learning the meanings of more complex ones. For example, 議 (deliberation) is a fairly common kanji, but also a rather complex one to write. So, Heisig has you first learn 言 (words), 羊 (sheep), 我 (ego), and finally 議 (words + righteousness). As a result, RTK functions as a directed acyclic graph of kanji-dependancies. Sweet.

But, and then to list all the kanji that are possible to write using that primitive plus any combination of the previous primitives.

So, we order the kanji primarily by frequency, while still constraining them via Heisig's DAG? Could this actually work, and produce an ordering that would give a fairly close approximation to the learning order we want, without losing the simplified mnemonics of RTK?

Well, but there was still a LOT of hand-manipulation (手掌, hehe) that had to be done to fix ambiguities, typos, scrambled data, etc. But once I finally had everything sanely loaded into a .csv file, all it took was a very simple python script to run any arbitrary ordering through the DAG.

The results are really interesting! I've used two orders so far: the ""frequency"" field in the KANJIDIC db, i.e. the order Japanese children are taught in school (unfortunately, I can't find an easily parsable reference to the actual order of the kanji within a grade, but in the long run this probably doesn't matter too much). It turns out that if you only want to learn the first 500 most frequently used newspaper kanji, you only have to learn 755 kanji/primitives total! And to learn the 1000 most frequently used, you only have to learn 1269 total. Oddly enough, the ""DAG overhead"" seems to stay fairly constant at around 250 for almost any number of ""target"" kanji. Weird.

Here are the output files from my two sample runs. If you're completely lost as to what I've been talking about until now

[KANJIDIC Frequency](http://pleep.com/~will/neworder-freq.html)

[School Order](http://pleep.com/~will/neworder-school.html)

The fields are:

Heisig Index,Frequency Index

Now, nearly all the thread-related kanji to be covered in this book will appear in this lesson, so you can learn them all at once.""). But, for every ""grouped"" primitive like this, there are plenty of kanji with primitives that heisig spreads all around willy-nilly. Are these kanji really that much harder to learn than the others? In my opinion, it depends greatly on the quality of the story you use. Top-rated stories from kanji.koohii.com go a long way in making RTK do-able.

Also, but I don't quite have it working yet)~~. Most importantly, I'd like to get some feedback from people as to whether this whole idea seems useful or not. If not, that's fine, it was amusing enough to find out the answer to my question. But if people try this ordering and like it, maybe I will put up a web page to act as a central place to go for information. I am also open to suggestions for additional useful learning orders which I haven't thought of.

Finally

**TLDR**: I changed the ordering of RTK to make it easier to learn commonly-used kanji without having to go through the entire set. Feedback is appreciated.

Since you asked so nice here you go. It surprises me how little video games are talked about on this reddit


1. No kanji whatsoever. Early games did not have the extra space for kanji and many games where aimed for children.


2. Some kanji. These games have some very basic kanji such as 私 or 分 but there may be much more in intro text crawls/intertitles or on signs. Probably around 100 kanji tops for dialog. Example of a intertitle: http://i.imgur.com/zDlf3.jpg


3. Full use of kanji. Development technique had advanced far enough for  full/almost full use of kanji


Some recommendations by system: 

Game Boy/Color - have yet to find a game with any kanji. 

Saga 1-3(Final Fantasy Legend 1-3)
Kaeru no Tame ni Kane wa Naru
Seiken Densetsu(Final Fantasy Adventure)



NES/Famicom- Almost all game are Level1 but have a few notable Level 2 exceptions. 


Level 1:
Final Fantasy 1-3
Dragon Quest 1-4
Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei 1&amp;2
Sweet Home
Mother(Earthbound Zero)

Level 2: 
hitler no fukkatsu(Bionic Commando in the US)




Super Nintendo/Super Famicom


Level 1:
Final Fantasy IV
Dragon Quest V
Super Mario Rpg
Shin Megami Tensei 1


Level 2:

Mother 2(Earthbound)-a few intertitles only
Seiken Densetsu 2(Secret of Mana)- Almost no kanji in dialog but tons in intertitles. 
Dragon Quest VI


Level 3:
Final Fantasy V-VI
Chrono Trigger
Tales Of Phantasia
Star Ocean
Shin Megami Tensei 2/ Shin Megami Tensei if....


Reasons this helps learning(in my opinion)

1. Helps general reading.

2. Exposes the reader to different styles of writing kana/kanji(Handwritten style fonts vs more computer styled ones.)

3. Make your friends jealous!

Hope this has been helpful. I would love to hear everyone's suggestions/comments!

1322238517.0,moz60,Living Japanese: Break Free from the School Mindset,Tigoris,33,11,11,"When it comes to self-teaching Japanese

Wrong.

If you would be so kind as to look back at the days of your obligatory education, teachers, and the government all pushing you to attend, you probably would have never continued going to school. I realize that many people do enjoy learning and school, but I think we can all admit that there were many days that we didn't want to be there, yet were forced to attend anyways.

With self-teaching, nobody is going to be there to push you. You are completely in control of your learning, which means that it's all on YOU to keep yourself wanting to come back. That means no lesson plans, no textbooks, no forcing yourself to eat all of your vegetables before you can have any cake (I use this metaphor too much). With self-teaching, a different approach is needed.

My preferred method for maintaining a healthy self-teaching environment is to hide all of the learning inside of something fun. Instead of sitting down to learn vocabulary, chatting with friends in Japanese, or anything else you do - focus on the fun and not on the studying. Despite what we may like to think, we are still very much children inside. What is fun is what gets done, so make learning Japanese as fun as possible.

The important thing to take from this article is that you can't act like a drill instructor. Be gentle with yourself and remember that all things Japanese will move you closer to fluency. Also, so make your method comfortable for yourself.

Should I mention first-off my experience for sake of making it easier for people to recommend things? You can skip the next few paragraphs if it doesn't matter much.

The course eventually piqued my interest in Japan's food and culture as well. Unfortunately, it was sort of a mark of shame. A couple of years later, when I graduated, they ended up putting that freaking course on my final report card (It 'counted' as a grade 11 course I believe, even though I took it in grade 9) and it brought my average down *ALMOST* a full letter grade.

ANYWAYS! Recently my cousin's been sharing his anime love with me (I'm not really a fan of the art style... but some of the stories are really good!) and I'm occasionally catching a word or phrase I recognize from that course years back. It's rekindled my interest.

My attempt at googling for a good site to learn japanese sort of left me overwhelmed -- there's so much out there, so I'm not faulting /r/learnjapanese for it or anything like that! I thought I'd ask here though, what *are* y'all using to learn?

**Handwriting / Stroke order**

Reddit says: Learn you stroke order.

**Writing on a computer**
Most people use Windows IME (for Windows) or Google IME: http://www.google.com/ime/. 
Both do the job.

I would recommend assigning a shortcut to conveniently switch between languages. Example: Ctrl+Shift+Number. Now you should be able to type. 

For truly beginners: Choose the hiragana option. You type the hiragana. If you want katakana then type the word and hit space and choose the katakana. Be precise or it wont recognize the word

Things to be aware of; all small kana can be typed ""l + kana"" or ""x + kana"". Examples:

* ィ is typed ""li"" or ""xi"".

* ティ is typed ""thi"" or ""texi"".

* づ is typed ""du"". 

* ぢ is typed ""di"".

When your browser encounters text, on websites that don't specify a Japanese font, depending on what you have installed, Chrome may render kanji as Chinese versions of the characters with slight variations on strokes for some characters.

&gt;We will now learn several other ways 「とする」 can be used. It may help to keep in mind that 「とする」 is really just a combination of the quotation particle 「と」 and the verb 「する」 meaning ""to do"". Let's say you have a sentence: [verb]とする. This means literally that you are doing like ""[verb]"" (in quotes). As you can see, you are acting as if to make a motion to do [verb]. As we have already seen, this translates to ""attempt to do [verb]"". Let's see what happens when we use it on plain verbs.

I get the literal translation and how it can also be stated as attempted to do [verb]

**Example A**


明日に行くとする。

Assume we go tomorrow.

**Example B**

In this example they show how it can be used with the conditional to express ""assuming if"":

今から行くとしたら、９時に着くと思います。

If we suppose that we go from now

 It says that in addition to changing it into the conditional form

Here is a review of the book for anyone who would want to use it to study for the next JLPT:

Vocab section - helpful

Grammar - this was by far the worst section of the book. Almost none of the grammar points the book has, on the ""star"" portion of the test where you have to organize the sentences, it did fairly well and really prepared me for not only the format, so I was confident in that section on the test as well.

Reading - wonderful. It really prepared me for all the long readings at my level and had very relevant questions so I was really prepared for the readings when I took the test. 

Listening - OK. I helped me get used to the listening section of the test and sounds very similar to the JLPT tapes. I didn't complete the listening section of the book (only did 1 CD out of 2) so I am not sure how helpful it could have been if I had finished. 

Overall I would say the book is a great if you have the money for it. It was quick to complete and I loved the reading section, not worth the price. 

Now let us know what books you used and if they accurately prepared you for the test. I need some new study material for next year and I am sure everyone else does too!

My vocabulary is mostly colloquial. I learned and spoke most frequently to family so I never learned much formal speak. I have taken a few classes in college to fix that but my ability levels are all over the place. 

My goal is to be able to hold a conversation on any normal topic and be able to read books without the subtext next to all the kanji. I'm probably 100 kanji in out of the 2000 needed to be a normal person. It hurts real bad.

Second

So as I said

**Wa**

Think of it like ""Speaking of...""; so you're using it to comment on something that has already been introduced into the sentence.

Example:
""Kitamura-san wa gakusei desu"". It means ""Mr Kitamura is a student""

**Note** that wa can also come after what looks like a clause

**Ga**

Ga が is the subject marker. There are a couple of ways you can think of it:

* As special emphasis to distinguish one thing from another

* In neutral descriptions or observable actions. ""Tegami ga kimashita"".

Hopefully this will help you distinguish between the two. There have been entire essays written on the distinction between the two as it is very subtle. And remember

Yes I know there was another post about this but it was months ago. Figured I'd give my little piece of help.

If you find this to be bullshit

Right now the program comes with five dictionaries all derived from Jim Breen's JDIC(the EDICT dictionary). There's one dictionary file that contains all words from JDIC except the ones that start with katakana or contain the {comp} tag which means the word is computer related(usually very high level as well).

I'm not very far into this at all and already I have separate Anki decks with large numbers of words in each one. The aggravating part of it is that there is little overlap between these two groups, but cannot speak. I am wondering then, whether it would be in my best interest to consolidate the decks and learn kanji, readings, and meaning for every new word, or just sit tight and let these two groups naturally merge over time. 

**tl;dr**: How do I tell where to put accents within words? Should I really be learning kanji &amp; spoken vocabulary separately?

Many thanks for any insight!

**Class Format**

The classes are held with a Java-based application (Mac and PC) that allows voice and video communication. It also comes with a few buttons, and a power-point display where the instructor can show students slides and even type on the slides if necessary.

The instructor will show their webcam but students are not required to show their webcams.

Class sizes are listed at a max of 7 students

Textbooks generally aren't required and no instructor required me to do homework or read from a textbook. All materials were included in the online lesson.

At the end of every session

**Scheduling**

You can take the classes in any order at your own convenience. 

Generally you must reserve a ""class"" usually about a day in advance. A list of available classes can be searched and you can review the scheduled lesson summary to see if you feel comfortable with what the lesson will cover.

They will also send you a reminder email about 3 hours before your actual lesson time.

The schedule page does not show you how many students are enrolled in a particular session so you cannot see beforehand how many students will appear.

**Language**

Since I enrolled in the intermediate classes

The slides and attached notes each instructor sends out will have English explanations and definitions of key vocabulary so you can usually read the description to get the information.

Generally students would ask questions in Japanese and the instructor would try to give simpler explanations if possible. Otherwise students would have to type in the English word if they could not correctly convey their thoughts. This only happened once throughout all three of my sessions.

All of the instructors I interacted with appeared to be Japanese and were living in Japan. None of them tried to speak English.

**Kanji**

All of the Japanese was written with kana+kanji as you normally would with standard Japanese. However readings for *most* kanji were usually included (as well as English definitions). Very common kanji readings were not include such as taberu, etc.

**Lesson format**

Each lesson is basically a set of slides with a few explanation slides followed by exercise slides (typically fill in the blank

For one lesson there was a reading first (demonstrating the grammar) followed by an explanation. But generally the format was grammar explanation followed by exercises.

For exercises

**Price**

The prices for flex lessons start at $59 for five 50 minute sessions and get cheaper as you purchase more lessons altogether. Private sessions are much more expensive. You can see the prices on their website.

For new students

**Summary**

Good:

* Usually possible to find a convenient time for your own timezone.
* Lessons are organized
* Japanese native instructors
* Flex lessons are well priced for the convenience
* Usually few students
* Content appears to be organized relative to the JLPT exams
* No English hand-holding

Bad:

* Online slide format is the only option for grammar lessons and most instructors appear to have the same format with very minor variations. If this doesn't suit your learning style
* Website and software aren't exactly user friendly but manageable--first session had some difficultly getting my microphone to work correctly.
* The exact slides used in the lesson are never distributed
* No English hand-holding

I would say this is a good transition for learners switching from late beginner to early intermediate material. I think late intermediates probably can learn just fine with self study. It is a bit pricey (but all tutoring is pricey) so it is probably best suited for people living in remote areas or with busy work schedules. You're basically paying for someone to draw up a lesson plan and correct you in real-time. The good part about this is the Japanese is much closer to how natives actually use the language.

* Books which you like
* Links to JLPT resources.  Since past exams are usually crappy scans on kind of sketchy sites
* Resources available outside of Japan you think people should know about (import bookstores

Things I do not want:

* Questions/answers about the JET program.  I'll probably stick a link to the official page at the end or something, so I would like people to get their information from official sources, or at least ask individually so they can get more specific answers.

If you don't mind (or enjoy) gratuitous ultraviolence &amp; frequent nudity

Pros:

- A lot of long action scenes with exceptionally detailed and beautful (or horrific) artwork. Once you've plowed through a dialog-heavy scene and looked up a bunch of words
- A lot of suspense and twists leave you wondering ""what happens next
- For the dialogue you get a mix of far-out sci-fi conversations (and vocabulary) which is always fun

Cons:

- No furigana, I found Gantz easier to get through than, say, One Piece.
- Excessive violence and  nudity may turn some people off

1374387103.0,1iqm0m,Manga Suggestions for an American Comics Fan (with furigana)?,morgzaloha,22,9,17,"Greetings all

I'm currently finishing up a semester abroad in Tokyo.  My Japanese is pretty decent

As such

I've browsed around Reddit and the web, but others in the future.

Thing is, near an ""otaku.""  That's not to say I'm not nerdy, I am.  I mean, I'm a Westerner in Japan - so.  But my care for anime / manga culture doesn't go much further than Pokemon, Lupin (new series rocks by the way check it), Panty &amp; Stocking with Garterbelt, Cowboy Bebop

I am a huge American comics reader (and a huge reader in general); I like my superheroes (mostly DC), Preacher, Ghost World, Hard Boiled, Manhattan Projects, Scott Pilgrim, V, Sandman
.

Since I'm more into adult-orientated comics, but I will never read One Piece and I just am not into Naruto-esque stuff (sorry guys).

So here goes:
I want manga that a) has furigana and b) is somewhat intellectual / interesting and c) not necessarily lobbied towards your day-to-day otaku.

I figured we could put a list like this together; since I know I'm not the only one out there facing this issue - and the best way to learn language is to read

So far

ベルサイユのばら (The Rose of Versailles)

新世紀エヴァンゲリオン (Neon Genesis Evangelion)

I've seen countless post here and Google + and facebook in the past few months about becoming fluent in a year or skipping JLPT levels

First, you only need to memorize grammar, vocabulary and be decent at listening.  Most people can do this. But what do you get out of this? A piece of paper saying that you passed….great. But can you understand the context of a conversation or hold a conversation? Most likely not. I did this method before living in Japan and it screwed me when I got there because I couldn’t hold a conversation. I was upper N5 at that time. Maybe this is why the tests got harder?

Second, hard! The JLPT (passing N1)  is just the top of the iceberg in terms of the language, but it gives you a very solid start into the language (I believe college level). This is why most people think the test is a bit of a joke until N2 or N1. Also people who go this way takes classes, are really good at self- studying and/or have a tutor. You get a ton of assets by going this route. You can communicate, understand the language and culture and get a sense of accomplishment. Japanese will be ingrained into your mind by going this route.

It primarily concerns two sections

First of all concerns using なる Or する with verbs:

海外に行くことになった。

It's been decided that I will go abroad. (lit: It became the event of going abroad.)

毎日、肉を食べるようになった。

It became so that I eat meat everyday. (lit: It became the appearance of eating meat everyday.)

海外に行くことにした。

I decided I will go abroad. (lit: I did toward the event of going abroad.)

毎日、肉を食べるようにする。

I will try to eat meat everyday. (lit: I will do toward the manner of eating meat everyday.)

These are the examples extracted from the site. First of all concerns the usage of koto and you, is it a bigger difference in meaning? In other words, I have no idea if I were to construct my own sentence, whether I should be using you or koto.

Secondly, countless of trying to understanding this grammar I can only say it as simple I have no idea what it is about. Anyone maybe able to dumb it down like a 5 year old could understand it?

Second part concerns てみる and ようとする.

These constructions seems to me  as nearly identical

Then again in English you would say: ""I will attempt to try climb Mount Fuji"" rather than ""I will try to climb Mount Fuji"" where the second statement is a bit more vague and can carry different meanings.
