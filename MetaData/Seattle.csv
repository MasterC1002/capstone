This post will likely get a series of immediate downvotes by the trolls that hang in IRC all day

Suggestions:

* remove the IRC channel from the sidebar. It just serves as a place for upvote and downvote brigades.

* remove the rules from /r/Seattle and just follow the [reddiquette](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/reddiquette). If the moderators and their friends don't have to follow the rules

EDIT: Sorry I've been working all day. I am glad this post received attention. As you can see in the comments our friends careless, while /u/radpanda and /u/pretendperson are continuing to be insulting and racist like it's just a big joke. Look at their user history for more proof of their abuse and misuse. And see [this](http://i.imgur.com/2tUQh.jpg) and [this](http://i.imgur.com/wyXf2.jpg) too.

EDIT2: Someone private messaged me and said she has been harassed and name-called by radpanda at a past Reddit meetup. I won't say anything more about her story because she probably doesn't want to be ID'ed and that's why she didn't comment. But please everyone

EDIT3: Even the people in the comments defending the IRC channel agree that radpanda and pretendperson are odd fellows

I know the SPD (very deservedly) gets a lot of flack for being violent and/or racist.

Today while we were walking through Pioneer Square she saw a mounted officer. She doesn't make it into the city nearly as much as I do and had never seen a cop on a horse so we stopped for her to geek out for a minute.

There was a black man who appeared to be just this side of homeless selling things laid out on a blanket on the street corner. The cop rode up to him and said something I couldn't make out. I assumed he was asking for some sort of permit, he handed him the rest of the pack, said something in a friendly tone and rode off while the street vendor replied with an enthusiastic thanks.

Of course there are no news cameras rushing in to get this interaction out to the public. It doesn't vindicate any cops who've committed crimes against civilians for any reason. It's just nice to be aware that some of them aren't out there to kick every minority in the ribs they can get to the ground for any reason.

1306848695.0,ho7n6,I wrote the Seattle Police Department for clarification regarding the legality filming police officers. This was their response.,,473,55,70,"This was my letter:

Firstly

The reason I am writing to you is because I have a question I would like to have definitively answered: are citizens allowed to film police carrying out their duties? 

1) If filming an officer carrying out his official duties is unlawful

2.) If filming an officer carrying out his official duties is lawful under Washington state law

And this was their response:
 
In a public place, whether filming or observing, the activity cannot interfere with the officers duties.  For the officers safety, the officers attention should not be distracted from the person or situation they are dealing with so the officers can tell you to stay back a reasonable distance.  This  can vary depending on the circumstances and the risk of the situation they are investigating (e. g. move back several feet, across the street or down the block).  Failure to do so could constitute Obstructing a Public Officer (see SMC 12A.16.010). The officers request must be reasonable, but it may be based on information about the situation that you are not aware of, such as the possibility of a weapon –  so the request may be for your safety
 
I cannot think of a reason you should be asked to destroy a recording.  However
 
So in summary, my answers only address the specific activity of filming the officers.  Keep in mind that other words, actions or behaviors by the person making the recording have a direct relationship to how much disruption or interference is being created and the size of any safety zone the officer can reasonably demand.
 
I hope my answer has been helpful.  Please let me know if you have any further questions on this matter.

Now, but in the spirit of doing the right thing, will you please make an effort to vote yes on I-502.

If it passes, because even though the 10th amendment is around (is that the right one? Sorry, I'm smoking weed), I think the whole situation is so entrenched that I'm more interested in the legal war that will erupt if it passes than being able to buy shitty weed at Safeway.

Anyway, and some of you seem very happy about that today, so please throw the potheads a vote for I-504 this Nov.

PS: Gays, you know I'm voting yes on getting gay married. That is a no-brainer. Help the stupid stoner in your life out too.

Thank you /r/Seattle and enjoy your booze.

We met up at 9:30am-ish outside of Uptown Espresso and headed to The Bicycle Pull-Apart to meet up with Eric. Eric however was not at the shop yet so the two of us headed to 5 points where we sat on some benches and talked for three or four hours. In that time people inside of The Five Points Cafe would come out and join us. We would strike up conversations ranging from Freemasonry being creepy as hell to the sexual fetishes of a certain policewoman. 

In the afternoon we parted ways, very comfortable bicycle that I feel secure on.

It'll make me bounce off the walls and laugh and stay up. This other one is Y strain. It'll make my back stop hurting and I'll be asleep in an hour.' That right there is fucking awesome.


The real nail in the coffin lid for me: I'm willing to pay slightly higher prices for never having to listen to someone's shitty playlists, never having to keep track of an ever-changing cell phone number for my guy because they use disposable phones, and never having to stand around talking to a dealer for an hour and a half because they're confused about whether I'm a customer or a buddy, even though the prices they're giving me clearly put me in the customer category. For not having to deal with all that bullshit, I will happily buy a $40 or even $48 eighth instead of a $30 or $35. 


We just did something amazing, I'm sure there'll still be a black market for you to buy from, but for fuck's sake, at least appreciate the awesomeness of what happened to us all last week.

1364400828.0,1b47ix,Seattle do you recognize this car? They side-swiped me this morning and took off!,NiftyPistols,316,87,252,"This morning the person driving [this car](http://i.imgur.com/mdF4wkh.jpg) had a vendetta against me!

The only reason I can think is that I honked at them when them cut me off (nearly running into me a first time) as I-5 merged with 520 (heading east towards Kirkland/Bellevue). They flipped me off

I started to change lanes from the right to the left, I was not trying to pass this person, I honestly did not want to be anywhere near them. They were driving too erratically. But then my lane proceeded to go faster than his. I waited. I shit you not I waited, I waited for him to change lanes before passing him because I knew that he, for whatever reason, did not want me in front of him, therefore I did not want to be in front of him. But he stayed, so I started to pass, and then slammed on his brakes! I had to hit the brakes so hard I swerved a little

So I backed off. I had several car lengths between he and I. I am not going to lie I really did not want to be anywhere near him.

The lane to my left started to slow down again. I thought 'Just my chance

Nope. The left lane started moving again. Well, I can get past the bus, get back in the right lane and be done with this fellow.

NOPE again! I should have known better. But oh well

He straight up just changed lanes right into me as if I wasn't even there. Then shot out in front of me

I called the state trooper and gave them a description of the vehicle, I believe male).

So it is a red Subaru hatchback of some sort with black rack on top

I am still shaken up. I never would have thought that someone would throw themselves into someone else. Driving is not a game. It is not about winning and losing. We are all just trying to get somewhere.

**edit** I guess I did not make it clear



**Update** 

Thanks for your comments and suggestions, and this could have been a lot worse. 

The State Trooper was just here. He took pictures of the damage and has started a collision report for me and filed a hit &amp; run report and everything so that I can call my insurance company and get all of that sorted out. 

He said that the chances are slim of catching this guy, he wanted to make sure that I knew that, especially since my description of the guy was vague, as I didn't get as good a look at him as I would have liked. But that he would still put the description out there and he would keep his eyes/ears open and would keep me posted on any developments.

He did say that this guy might try and call to file his own report for his own insurance and that would be the most likely way to find him.

But, I am way behind on my work and feel like I have had several double espressos, but in good health none the less.

If

I was in the group marching at mid day.  There were maybe 200 people total and we accomplished what I thought was the surface level goal- we blocked traffic, as we turned up Seneca (I think) street I saw 'protesters', dressed in black, smash the windows of a Bank of America.  Next it was Wells Fargo, then another building, then Nike Town and American Apparel; the violence even engulfed cars, trashcans and signs in the vicinity.  Tear gas was dropped by police prior to Nike Town/American Apparel getting smashed and graffiti-ed, quickly dispersing us into fragmented groups.

What I want to emphasize here is that the 'protesters' dressed in all black were a group within the group.  I know because I was walking next to them and was able to hear them coordinating with each other as they addressed each other by name.  They wore black pants, black hats, black face masks, black goggles/glasses, which made them indistinguishable from one another, and while they were walking amongst the May Day protesters, they never intended to be a part of them.
They were there for the violence, among other things, were what were used to cause the damage to businesses.

So thanks, it's you that will be the gruesome face of this day, and it's because of you that the ignorant and the still uninformed will take that much longer to become active and aware, because they won't want to side with violent groups seemingly determined just to fuck things up.",,False,self,True,t3_t2c4u

**Do not sign Referendum 74.**

If R74 fails to get enough signatures, then there will be a statewide vote as a part of the November ballot to see if the legislation can become law.  

In addition

I-1192 attempts to define marriage as being between one man and one woman.  So shut that shit down.

Part 2:

Unfortunately, **proponents of gay marriage must vote YES on R74.**

In Addition:

I-1192 is not worded in that way

TL;DR

**If you support gay marriage:**

**Don’t sign Referendum 74 or Initiative 1192**

**But VOTE YES on Referendum 74**

**And VOTE NO on Initiative 1192**

This morning, one of them instructed me to perform an anatomically impossible act. I understand the motivation for this response -- I was kind of being a jerk. That said, people really should not be running in bike lanes, particularly when they can't see whether they are blocking traffic.

And I get it. Really. The sidewalks are uneven. The roads are smooth. Cars (generally) stay well away from bike lanes, though, please run against traffic -- just like you're supposed to when you run on any street -- so that you can see oncoming bikers and get out of the way. Please tell your friends to do the same.

Oh, there are cyclists who are idiots. They run red lights, they blow past pedestrians on the sidewalk, they almost run over kids on the Burke-Gilman trail because they're too busy checking their Strava. These are exactly the people who will hit you when you're running in a bike lane.",,False,self,False,t3_1j7wq0

Sadly one of my dear friends has gone missing since 7/14/12 at 4pm. Her name is Meagan, and just turned 20. She is about 5 feet 4 inches tall, pink/purple hair past her shoulders (I have no recent pictures of her current hair), she was wearing a white see through dress and a white shirt underneath, knee high socks, along with colorful accessories in her hair. She was last seen on 8th and Spring, her shoes were found on the sidewalk so she should be barefoot. She looks younger for her age as well, no friends have seen or heard from her. Hospitals/police have already been called

Any tips on how to find her would be welcome as well.
PM me with any details you may have of her whereabouts
Thank you.

Pictures of her below:
Edited out.

**edit**: A missing persons report has already been filed.

Her family are going to call the medical examiner in a few short minutes. Waiting for any updates.

**9:00pm**;; Still no word.

**UPDATE** The body was confirmed. 
Rest in Peace Meagan Bly.

Thank you everyone for sharing the posts and spreading around her picture.
Sorry for the grammar errors in advanced.


**Edit 2:** Thanks for all the words guys.
I'd rather not explain her death over this post just in case any other friends wander across this thread.
I don't want anyone else finding out her death like I had to do. Thank you in advance for the words of comfort. ",self,t5_2qhad,1342453504.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/wm6aq/missing_friend_in_seattle_last_seen_71412_at_4pm/

I was on the last 522 en route to Woodinville after a concert at Showbox.
By the time the bus gets to the 61st and NE Bothell Way stop, but ultimately lost him. 

I've reported this to the authorities


So

 I realized that he probably hasn't logged me out of my apps

**ANYWAYS TL;DR** [Here is his face](http://i.imgur.com/9WMbLSI.jpg). I'm hoping someone on this Subreddit can help me identify him. Thank you all for reading

EDIT: Sorry mods
as well as the phone number for the kenmore precinct where I reported the crime - (206) 296-3311

~~EDIT #2: So I was diddling around my Facebook

EDIT #3: I got the call from the Officer that I filed the police report with, but I'd like to thank you all wonderful people for helping me out! Yesterday I thought getting my phone back was a lost cause, but today I feel like I might get it back. I'm not keeping my hopes up, *but I totally am.*

EDIT #4: Hehe

EDIT #5: I removed the Activity Log picture at the request of the mods

EDIT #6: Whoa so I'm totally a celebrity now -- except not. I was featured on Komo and Q13, I'm updating this with some new information. According to a guy who added me on Facebook, he said that the kid is 16/17, hangs out at a local public library, and his first name is Damion. I sent this information to the police, but I haven't heard back yet. I'm hoping they can finally identify him though. This has been a ridiculous misadventure.",,self,,

**EDIT:** So after reading the Anarchists thread it seems they have no interest in self-policing and are trying to brush off any accountability for vandalism. It's obvious that it's encouraged. Another post essentially said *any business owner* is a ""capitalist"" so they are a legitimate target. It's ridiculous. 

**To the Anarchists**
If you really hate these corporations, not your cause, not the working class, *nobody*. **We love our fucking city** and you treated it like shit just for the sake of being destructive and your love of chaos. Now, I fully support your right to PEACEFULLY protest and that means not taunting the cops for an excuse to start vandalizing. If you don't want to be associated with chaos then make an effort to stop it before it gets out of hand. Then maybe people will start listening to you.

Brings games and whatnot! I might bring a speakers + portable amp so we can squabble over what music to play.
