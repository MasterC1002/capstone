This is pretty ridiculous for a number of reasons

I need to stop for a second to point out that [the admins have no intention of banning the /r/gaymers subreddit outright](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaymers/comments/zmrfh/gaymers_could_be_banned_and_deleted_by_tomorrow/c65z162) - however, nor is it a service; and if /r/gaymers can't use the term, then by extension *nobody* can use it. And that's not okay. It's also not okay, at least in my opinion, for the owner of gaymers.org to try to bully other people like this.

Obviously any sort of witch-hunt is unacceptable. But what we can do, or to post on their forums in support of /r/gaymers. You might also send a quick email to [the EFF](https://www.eff.org/about/contact) asking if they can help. The reddit admins are already aware of the situation and are basically on the community's side on this, so it isn't necessary to contact them.

Thanks

**UPDATES**

Read [the official response from gaymer.org owner Chris Vizzini](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaymers/comments/znqsd/regarding_reddit_cease_and_desist_from_gaymerorg/) - who should really know better than to start a land war on Reddit, is truly inconceivable.

While my coworker painted his face with pinks, I chatted with the mother. I told her that I really appreciated her letting him get that with no qualms, and I was impressed by how little he had worried about the normally gendered design.

I told the customer she had been my favorite all day and would have given her a discount if I could.

Medicine Hat, but the gay community in this city (because very few of us are actually out and proud) is really disconnected from eachother and I fear a crumby turnout due to, well, fear.

It's a funny joke, but it's very honestly based in truth.

So unless you explicitly have consent from someone to touch them in such a manner, that I know of, who dress like that for parades are doing it for the freedom and attention.

This really

Why? Because the fight for equality is *so far* from over. The decision the Supreme Court is talking about is just the tip of the iceberg. It's AWESOME that such a monumental decision for gay and lesbian rights is being made this week

But we still have so much to do. These are a few things I can think of off the top of my head:

• Full acceptance and support for trans- people (including healthcare which supports SRS
• [Legal recognition of non-binary gender identities](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/recognize-non-binary-genders/80HYg71P) (ex: allowing people to put X as their gender on passports and stuff).  
• Further acceptance and knowledge of various other less well-known identities such as asexuality, which people somehow still manage to get confused by.    
• Making sure that gender identity and *expression* is a category legally protected from discrimination.

Not to mention that it's problematic that gay marriage is easy to sell because it's largely portrayed as attractive, cis males trying to conform to society's standards of living. [This article](http://www.changelabinfo.com/2013/03/25/why-i-support-same-sex-marriage-as-a-civil-right-but-not-as-a-strategy-to-achieve-structural-change/) describes some of my points (though I don't agree with all of it).

I went to Guilford College in North Carolina which, especially regarding sexuality.  I was at one of many bon-fires in the woods behind the school, where people were socializing.  Suddenly, a fairly inebriated individual stands up and addresses the bonfire (it was smallish, like 40 people).  He starts rambling about how he came to visit the school and might attend in the fall and that he loved everything about the school.  At this point his friend makes some light-hearted comment about him being drunk, suggesting he should sit down.  He responds by saying, ""Oh quit being such a fag"".

What followed was the first time I have seen not only members of the lgbtq community

The kid stuttered out an apology (it was probably overwhelming having that many people suddenly oppose something you just said), that kind of speech just isn't cool here"".  And that was the end of it.  I saw the kid over the rest of the night just kind of relax and be incorporated into conversations around him.

The thing that made it so cool for me wasn't just the solidarity of the community in shooting down ""fag speech"", he was told what would and wouldn't be tolerated, but that he was welcome to join us if he respected everyone there.  I've always felt like that's the only way to change minds; with empathy.

TLDR: Guy gets shut down when he calls someone a fag by like 40 people but they do it the right way.

I had moved away from the LGBT scene for quite some time

My story is a bit typical, thought about suicide constantly and I really hated myself, zero confidence, very few friends and the only thing I had any interest in was world of warcraft. I remember I felt very dysphoric about my body since the start of puberty, I had been a happy outgoing child but with then the reality of becoming a man dawning, I became withdrawn. I was maybe 18/19 when I really became aware of transgender people and the possibility of transitioning, and seeing people's timelines and youtube videos.

I felt very, then so could I. I really picked myself up, lost weight, then started to see a therapist and after a few months (but it felt like ages at the time) got hormones. By the time I was 21, I had been on hormones a year and felt great about myself, so much more confident and outgoing. Had a boyfriend for a while too who was great but drifted apart.

When I was 22 I started to feel that I had gone a bit overboard with all the girly stuff, how far back into the male side of things could I go without feeling uncomfortable again? So I started to test myself, see how far I could push myself before hitting that wall. I never hit it. I wasn't uncomfortable with having a woman's body, that wasn't ever the motivation for reverting.

It was just before my 23rd birthday I stopped hormones completely. It was a bit ruff at first, because I was pretty skinny and the extra muscle helped people identify me as a man. I've spent the last year now living as a fairly androgenous/femme man, and things have been really good. I've moved to a new city, got a great circle of friends and a really good life.

Normally I only told close friends and partners about my past, but I honestly don't regret a thing. At first I felt very guarded about transitioning, but it was a big step on the way to me truly feeling comfortable with myself and really finding out who I am, it was a positive thing, and I wouldn't trade those years for the world.

So

Just wondering what other people's thoughts are. Perhaps someone who works in software/online development of this sort could shed some light on why StumbleUpon might have chosen to categorize ""LGBT interests"" in this way.

I just got off the phone with her

Her response to me telling her was this:

""Ok then. Doesn't change anything with me.""

HOLY FUCKING SHIT!! Here I was freaking out that she would absolutely flip! And she had the nerve to tell me it was ""ok!"" I was curled up in a ball sitting in front of my computer, and she has the fucking nerve to say without changing her expression, ""ok then.""

I'm still shaking

5 years of dread and worry and heartbreak finally ended with a simple ""ok then."" She seemed more concerned about what the rest of the content of the email was and seemed to shake off everything else. The only other thing she asked was if I met someone. I said no

I suddenly feel 10 pounds lighter, and a lot more true to myself.

After feeling depressed about it for two days, but know I feel I can finally tell my whole family (well, at least my mom's side).

First there was [an innocuous request for polyamory flag flair](http://www.reddit.com/r/ainbow/comments/10t7bn/polyamory_flag/) that got downvoted to oblivion and mainly attracted comments enthusiastically expressing the opinion that polyamory is bullshit. Then there was [a proposal to create a  flag for demisexuality](http://www.reddit.com/r/ainbow/comments/10yscs/calling_all_demisexuals_lets_create_your_flag/) that also got downvoted to oblivion and mainly attracted comments enthusiastically expressing the opinion that demisexuality is bullshit. There was also [a question about pansexuality](http://www.reddit.com/r/ainbow/comments/10ymiz/question_for_pansexuals/) that actually got upvoted, and many comments telling other people that they were wrong to identify as bisexual and were really pansexual, or vice versa.

I'm angry. I saw the polyamory thread and I found the comments unbelievable, as someone who is demisexual, that was a pretty unpleasant experience. I was previously fortunate enough to have never really seen hate directed at demisexual people, mainly because most people who have even been exposed to the concept tend to belong to communities that respect diverse identities. I thought /r/ainbow was that kind of community, but maybe I was wrong.

I'm worried that /r/ainbow changing from a place where the diversity of people's identities and experiences is (usually) respected, offensive shit about groups I don't like and get congratulated for it.""

Thursday afternoon I was out, I went to get on but there was a bike leaning against the side of the structure in my way. I started to walk around it but one of two guys who was sitting at the stop got up to move the bike, saying ""Sorry, ma'am"", I replied ""No worries, thank you!"" As I was stepping on the the bus the other guy yelled really loudly ""Dude, that's a guy!"" and I just wanted to cry. I didn't look at him or react in any way

When the guy yelled that the bus driver stared at me with a look of mild disgust on her face and she seemed unduly irritated that I had to dig through my purse for a few seconds to find another quarter for a transfer. When I dropped the coin into the receptacle she yanked the transfer slip off the pad and shoved it into my hand then waited for me to start walking to my seat before she accelerated very quickly and I didn't have time to get my balance before I stumbled

The only seat available was on a bench of four seats between 2 other people, judging me for being a freak. I just tried to make myself as small as possible to try to avoid notice and died a little inside. Once she started, she didn't stop laughing, giggling, chuckling, even quietly.

I don't know if anyone other than that guy who yelled really saw me as something of an oddity but that just set the tone for how I felt during the rest of my trip. At one point I was feeling so horrible I almost decided to just get off at the next stop and take the next bus home and get drunk. The only thing that stopped me was the thought that I'd have to face the same feelings of standing out as a freak to be ridiculed no matter which way I went. So instead I decided...

**FUCK THEM! They don't get to win.**

I'm glad I didn't go home. The meeting was great! We discussed  a wide range of topics, voice (one woman who was there just once before she moves out of town is good friends with CandyFLA, the woman behind the ""finding your female voice"" videos on YT). One pre-everything woman who feels her non-trans related challenges make transition an insurmountable challenge said she was considering reparative therapy because she'd heard good things about it... I felt really bad for her because I can't really do anything for her other than be a good friend but towards the end of the meeting several women further on in transition talked to her and eased some of her worries.

One of the newer members of the group told me she thought, so that made me feel good because I'm not, yet. I told my friend (the one who who made me over for Pride a few weeks ago) I was planning to order spiro and estrogen online when I get back from my trip to Cleveland because right now I'm saving up for that trip, she said when I get back she'll introduce me to her doctor who charges on a sliding scale for blood work and a 3 month supply of HRT, so YAY! After the meeting I went out to a couple of bars and karaoke with 3 of the other ladies and one of their partners who is androgynous, doesn't identify as either male or female but prefers masculine pronouns and calls himself a gender nihilist. It was the most fun I've had in a long time and by the time I got home (about 3:30 AM) I'd gotten over the horrible bus trip. :)

The TL;DR of that post is that I sent my father some links providing some information he wanted to know and rather than addressing the content of those links he attacked me personally. 
______________________________

Anyway

Along with these links I received a message (from my mother):

&gt; “Please read every word. This reflects how I think you got where you are. And why you need to talk to a counselor to better understand the path you are on. I love you more than you will ever know.”

Reading these things make me so relieved that I didn't come out to my parents earlier and that they never found me out, my homosexuality, my political and philosophical views are all a result of my ""fucked up thinking"" and that they're all related somehow. Furthermore, when I brought it up he started claiming that I had an ""unhealthy obsession"" with this event that happened ""6 months ago"" (it was 3 months ago) and that me not ignoring it was a sign of me being OCD. wow.

Anyway

But before I do I want to at least show them evidence that people cannot “Resolve Same-sex Attractions” which I suppose is where you guys come in. Any peer reviewed evidence to the contrary is greatly appreciated along with any advice on how to handle this situation best from those who have experienced this before.

Where would I put up more ads for helping people with whatever they need (yard work, etc.)? 
Have any of you gone through similar experiences and how did you get through them? 
Are payday advances a good idea for the short term?

Thank you everyone for the outpouring of advice. I wasn't really expecting this to take off the way it did, and my bank has agreed to a short term loan at a student rate, and I've opened a line of credit with them. It won't be pretty but I think I'm ganna make it. I'm alot calmer than at the time of the original post and no longer thinking of fleeing the country (a joke, of course).

I was expressing a rant in probably the wrong tone and the wrong words and I apologize if I offended anyone.  That was never my intention.  

Let me just start by saying that a person's sexuality doesn't matter to me.  I love all people.  The two ladies that are almost sisters to me are both straight.  Sometimes though

So a group of us lesbos have a game night once a month at someone's house so its kid friendly.  We talk about work, or the plantation we are going to build on a private island as soon as one of us wins the lottery.  You know, normal stuff.  The one thing that doesn't really ever come up is sexuality.  Gay issues only ever crop up if its in the news.  Its not something that NEEDS to be discussed every fucking minute of my life.  

This past weekend, invite them over.

All fucking night we got to hear about how much they love the gays, we already know you are cool or we wouldn't have invited you.  SHUT THE HELL UP!  My life does not revolve around my sexuality!

It happens at work, or your thoughts on sexuality as a whole.  It just doesn't need to happen.  I don't stand around talking about how much I love straight people and how I teach my kids that its ok if someone has a mommy and daddy and we shouldn't treat them any different.

1353288367.0,13fcle,Got told by my mom not to come home for the holidays. How does one go about dealing with being alone for the first time?,harmonical,265,43,100,"To sum up quite a bit of back story

I started a small dose of HRT last November without telling them [mostly to make sure I was doing the right thing and I didn't want to put myself in purgatory waiting forever]. When I went back last Christmas I didn't take the meds with me for fear of them finding out. The entire trip was kind of awkward with my parents due to the straining our relationship was going though

Over the course of the next few months

I started HRT again

After doing so I refrained from asking about the holidays at all, but that I'd like to come back for Christmas.

At my therapy session this week, but a hoodie still suffices for the time being]. I agreed and did so in the middle of last week. The conversation with my mom essentially went ""I'm still doing electrolysis, my hair is longer, my face has changed a little and there is some 'chest development'"". She was a bit taken aback and said she'd need a couple days to process it.

Today she called and told me that I shouldn't come home

She then went on to tear into me saying that she doesn't see how changing my exterior will change anything in my life, or even believable. She basically thinks that I'm some sort of freak if I think that I can be comfortable with my current genital situation. She also wants me to know that she's not trying to upset or hurt me but that she wants to be honest with how she feels.

I felt like shit earlier today, but how am I supposed to keep trying to work my way through all of this? 

Thanks for reading this if you got through it all. For those of you with shorter attention spans:

**tl;dr**: boobs were a bridge too far

--------
edit: I just wanted to say thanks to everyone who took the time to read this and left awesome messages. I'm at work now and probably won't end up replying to everyone

To everyone offering me places to stay, I think I need to start building my own kind of traditions. I'm also currently trying to get my landlord to let me adopt a cat, so that would help a lot in the loneliness factor :3

They were wrong.

In 1986

I lost my faith because I kept reading the bible. Cover to cover. I couldn't understand the inherent contradictions I found. I did not see why a loving god would make me gay, you can't be it.

My feelings towards men has never changed. It's been this since I was 11 years old. It is true that feelings towards women have appeared

In 1986 I finally accepted being gay. I was very frightened but slowly life got better. I had my first boyfriend - that lasted two years and sadly ended badly. I made a lot of friends. I grew in confidence and the stupidity of what happened started to recede.

Edit: Thank you for all the well wishes. Honestly

Since I'm sure some of you want to know more about him and all I figure I'll give a little background or something?

He moved to the states from Korea in 8th grade. He came knowing barely any English. So what do we do as kids? Teach him how to curse. Haha. I think the most vivid memory besides that is I was openly queer in middle school. I was always that gay kid

I used to always proof read his English papers too since English wasn't his first language. I remember him writing on the blackboard before a Chemistry test ""Break the leg"". We all laughed pretty hard at that.

He was an amazingly talented individual. He knew several instruments quite well. He was at Rutger's in North NJ and wanted to switch his major to Music Education. He apparently had a partner at the time. I didn't see him after we graduated in '09. Something I deeply regret. I moved away from NJ right after graduating.

My friend texted me the morning of the 26th, my pop-pop remembers seeing the funeral procession and he says it was the longest he's ever seen.

He touched a lot of people,000 likes. Over 1,000. How many of these are people who actually knew him, I will never be sure. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if they all did...",,False,t5_2tcpq,True

Quick Preface:
I don't do much in the gay community. I don't go to the GSA meetings

Now to the story:

I finally decided to go to a club last night with some friends. It was 18+ night at Town in Washington

We make eye contact for a second while we dance in our own groups. The moment the eye contact happen I broke away and looked down, this time he's smiling. 

I break eye contact and smile. I make eye contact one more time and hold it, I don't know dances). As I fail to match his rhythm, I confess to him how bad at dancing I was. 

He says ""Don't think about it. Just DO.""

We keep dancing through like 10 songs. We sit down on some couches in the club and talk a bit. I don't remember what was said

When we got back to dancing, more ecstasy-feeling..he lifts his shirt over his head, so that only his arms are through the sleeves, but his chest is fully visible. And then he would take my hands and rub them across his chest. It was... *electric*

I stayed him him for 2 hours, kissing, dancing. Then he and his friends had to go. No phone number, but I'm okay with that, we were both visiting Town from 40 minutes away in different directions.

I can't believe that I had such an experience with a sexy stranger, all insecurities about dancing were gone. I flailed in all the right ways, or whatever, until all the muscles in my chest were sore from their bending and flexing.

Everybody from any walk of life should hit the clubs! All types were there

**TL;DR: Gay guy, lock eyes across the room with a stranger as the rhythm boomed, danced, made out, got good at dancing, 10/10 will dance again**

**Edit 2: I mentioned this in a comment, ended up biting me twice on the arm and licking my knee. I don't think we're compatible long term, but the dancing was fun.**

He was a zebra. He was studied and researched on intensely. He survived years until he started taking the cocktail with a perilously low T cell count. Tonight he died

Allen loved his mother, than either of his parents cared about him. 

I have seen Allen and Steven evicted for being gay, when it was clear that they were both infected and very often quite weak. 

He was one of the kindest

My mother had gay male friends when I was growing up. I have had gay male friends all of my life. They are some of my dearest and most beloved friends. And one by one

I want to remember the triumph that was Allen's life. I want to remember how much he loved his life partner, because he hoped what they learned from him would help others. I want to remember the kind nature and the sweet, goofy smile. That is the strong, wonderful gay man that I want to continue to celebrate and keep in my memory.  

When things get you down, with the man he loved for 30 years. A man that never let the bitterness that society dished out to him for his life choices, make him frowny or mean. A gay man that lived on his own terms, proudly and bravely. A man that never lost his quiet sense of humor, despite adversity and discrimination.

A little backstory: last week

She also said that seeing how /r/ainbow has evolved has caused them to re-evaluate. Their words: 

&gt; We have spoken with r/ainbow's moderators and have come to the
mutually agreeable conclusion that there is a need for a safe space
and r/lgbt can fill that need
unmoderated open discussion. No rivalry. No us vs. them. We fill one
need
have.

Just to be clear: I do not believe we are an unsafe space, and we believe that they have taken the steps necessary to implement hands-on moderation in a transparent and fair way.  For that reason we're going to link to them in the sidebar. We're also doing this as a gesture of goodwill; they have done the same for us. 

What else does this mean? Not much. /r/ainbow will continue to be exactly what it has been: a very loosely moderated free speech zone for the discussion of LGBT issues. But we do ask that you refrain from attacking /r/LGBT here. They are their own community

They have also set up a [system to handle community feedback transparently](http://reddit.com/r/lgbtopenmodmail)

There was a lot of upfuckedness that went down in the last couple of months, I personally believe this new direction can work for them. I never unsubscribed from /r/lgbt, but if I had, this would be the moment for me to resubscribe.
