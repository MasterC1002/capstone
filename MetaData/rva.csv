Otherwise you are responsible for the cost of getting rescued. The James at this level is no joke and from Pony Pasture down to the 14th st. bridge is serious whitewater that only Experienced Whitewater Paddlers should attempt.

The James is not safe for swimming and at this level and it tends to have the highest amount of pollutants (like fecal coliform) in the river so you don't want to be swimming in poopy water anyway! 

There have already been [several river rescues since yesterday even of experienced and permitted kayakers](http://www.nbc12.com/story/22211934/richmond-fire-working-river-rescue-at-the-james). Don't get in the water!!! Nobody wants to hang out with someone who is covered in river poop water anyway!

*Edit 2.0: Good response so far. For people wondering about the ""straight line"", this could be the first in a line of meet-ups. This city has plenty to offer- come up with ideas and post them.

1372708539.0,1hg3oy,Don't go to Grove Avenue Exxon,Tha_Scientist,70,21,31,"Story to follow

Prepare for a wall of text:

Grove Avenue Exxon in Richmond VA. Backstory: My Jeep's clutch pedal assembly broke and rather than tow my car 20-30 miles to my normal mechanic (Jimmie Seay of Automotive Concepts; Who is awesome by the way). I chose to have my car towed to Grove Avenue Exxon because it was much closer. Everything was fine at first. They said they would have to order the part and it would be 3-5 business days and that estimated costs would be around $300. Okay. Great. Here's the part where it all goes pear shaped and these ass hats fucked my car. I pick it up on Thursday June 27 and pay around $300 as estimated. But, I was very calm and respectful. First, even though I gave him $350 not 10 minutes ago he couldn't remember what the car was in for or who I was. He had to pull up the receipt.

Here's where I truly should have fucked this guy up for talking me to like this. He treated me like I didn't know anything about cars and that it was a waste of this time to even talk to me. He told me ""We didn't do anything electrical to your car, I didn't have this problem before y'all worked on it"". To which he replies ""Your car is 14 years old, this is a coincidence, it could be a myriad of things, but definitiely not our fault"". ""Well, can you check it out?"" I asked. ""Sure, for $66"" he replies. $66. Are you fucking kidding me? He should have said ""Yes, it'll only take a minute and if it is our fault we'll fix and if not we will gladly do the repairs if you want"". Upon my exasperation of this $66 raping he was trying to persuade me into he suggested I could take it to Autozone where they'll read the ECM codes for free but in his words

Flash forward to Saturday. I take my car to Autozone where I tell the guy behind the counter my check engine light is on and would he check it. He says ""Sure, in reality in his 30's, plugs in the monitor to my ECM, starts the car, reads the code and without checking a book or anything else says ""You have a gross leak/no flow from your gasoline vapor recovery system. Have you smelled gas?"" I say no, but it has smelled slightly funny. He proceeds to get under my Jeep, looks all around and says I don't see any problems with the line. He pops the hood, those guys at Exxon didn't reconnect the hose to the vapor recovery box"". They must have taken this hose off to get better access to your clutch assembly becuase it is below that area on the car and they forgot to reconnect. ""But, shit eating, you won't patronize these fucking twats either!

Oh, or another street. We've been so busy"" Well, if I had it my way you guys wouldn't see business ever again. The he preceeded to disrespect his clients saying. ""I bet the neighbors really love me for parking cars everywhere, but then when they come in on Sunday to get batteries replaced they want service"" Of course they do, your in the customer service industry you God damned fucking idiot. For those of you who don't know, Autozone is open on Sunday and they DON'T charge to replace your battery for you.

TL;DR: The fucktarded asshats at Grove Avenue Exxon will fuck your car up and claim it's not their fault when in nreality it most assuredly is.



UPDATE (02JUL2013): Went in there after work Monday and spoke to JT (not the guy I originally spoke to). I told him what happened and he asked for a description. Tall, and said Tim should have told me to come back another day and that they would check it out for free. But, he went on to say that Tim sometimes has these problems but that it is hard to find workers that will work afternoons and weekends. He essentially said, in not so many words, that he was sorry but he couldn't fire Tim but would talk to him and if this happens again ask for Chuck or Jerry/Gerry or a mechanic. Don't worry it won't happen again. I won't be back. EVER.",,False,t5_2qpvj,True

As the title suggests, you can probably testify to the good times that can be had on them, and if you haven't yet I strongly recommend trying it out.

These applications aim to be an improvement over the current mobile website supplied by 2BNB

This is the first release of these applications, and we welcome all feedback.  We're hoping you, or someone you know, can use these applications to go out and have a great time in Richmond, while remaining safe and avoiding driving after a night on the town.

As a final note

**Edit:**  There are a few things I probably should have mentioned in the original post

We are in no way associated with 2BNB outside of the fact that we live in the same city and agree with their goals of reducing drinking and driving.

Unfortunately

If for whatever reason you dislike the buses, and rerouting accordingly.

I've put up a small F.A.Q. that I wrote while developing and testing the app on my extremely underdeveloped website [here](http://roar11.com/portfolio/2bnb-android-app/).  There may be some answered questions there that aren't addressed here

A cold wind blows... my shark rises too quick into the night sky.  I try frantically to control it, flying over my apartment building... disappearing from view.

I've looked around, so there's a chance he's stuck up there, but I went onto the balcony and jerked the controller around listening for sounds from his motor indicating that he might be in range.  I heard nothing.

Odds are he'll rise into the atmosphere and pop before crashing down in a heap of mylar and cheap plastic motor encasing.  But just in case, let me know, it is probably mine.

Some of you may remember earlier this year, there was the largest protest at the Capitol since the days of Massive Resistance, resulting in the arrest of 31 men and women.  These actions were effective, and a lot of that legislation that had looked likely to pass was watered down, killed in committee, or voted against.

One of the bills (reappearing next session) would have granted personhood status upon conception - making not reporting a miscarriage within 2 hours a crime and outlawing several forms of birth control.  Another law (I believe it was passed) removed assistance for low-income women with high-risk pregnancies.  Another bill (voted against) would have stopped the shackling of pregnant inmates when they give birth - a traumatic and useless practice.  One that got a lot of attention was the transvaginal ultrasound bill (watered down and signed, a woman would have to have a probe inserted into her - this has been called state-sanctioned rape.

Having failed to make abortion completely illegal and lead us boldly forward into the early 18th century, and in the end will result in the closing of all but two clinics in Virginia.  **This is exactly the same as banning abortion even in the case of rape and incest**, but only for low income women - those with the ability to travel to a less oppressive area may still do so.

Now, this grandfather clause was removed.  My guess is that it's a combination of string pulling from Ken Cuccinelli and John Seeds (a radical anti-choice member of the Board of Health).

On September 14th

His name is George. He has a tag and the owner's name is Stephen but there is no phone number on the tag. He wandered up to my house which is a decent way from the fan district so my guess is he got away from someone visiting the area. I've tried percursory google searches


There are a decent number of fan residents on r/rva so I figured there might be a chance someone might know his masters. If you do please confirm the address and full name that is on the tag in a message.

There is a really active jazz scene in the city. There are a bunch of groups that play pretty frequently around town. [Fight the Big Bull](http://www.fightthebigbull.com/), and many others play around town pretty often. [The Camel](http://www.thecamel.org/) on broad st. is probably my favorite venue in town: cheap shows, nice space, lots of good performances. [Balliceaux](http://www.balliceauxrva.com/) and [Cous Cous](http://www.couscous900.com/) also have lots of good shows and some great food too. For the last few years there has been the [""Musicircus""](http://rvanews.com/entertainment/brian-jones-musicircus/50777) curated by Brian Jones in October which is a really cool experience and you get to hear a ton of local artists. [RVA Jazz](http://rvanews.com/jazz) is a really good resource for finding out what's happening too. The [Richmond Symphony](http://www.richmondsymphony.com/) is a very good orchestra that you should check out. They play in the super cool and recently built [CenterStage](http://www.richmondcenterstage.com/) complex that also houses many other art/music/theater projects. The [VCU Dept. of Music](http://www.vcu.edu/arts/music/dept/events/index.html) has tons of concerts from guests, faculty, and students for FREE. [The National](http://www.thenationalva.com/) gets a lot of pretty big rock acts that come through Richmond.

Also, and it was on the food network in a throwdown with Bobby Flay (which it won). [Chez Foushee](http://www.chezfoushee.com/) is a really nice place and has some great food for both lunch and dinner. Edo's Squid is a real hole in the wall Italian place that has some fantastic food. For lunch/sandwiches nothing beats [Homemades by Suzanne](http://www.homemadesbysuzanne.com/). I had lunch once at [Millie's Diner](http://milliesdiner.com/) and thought it was quite good. [The Hard Shell](http://www.thehardshell.com/) is the best seafood I've had in Richmond and is worth checking out at some point too. [Capital Ale House](http://www.capitalalehouse.com/) has a huge beer selection and on Mondays they have $2 burgers which is a steal. [Bottom's Up Pizza](http://bottomsuppizza.com/) has some of the best pizza in town. I've never been to [Carytown Burgers and Fries](http://www.carytownburgersandfries.com/), but I've heard nothing but good things. [Ginger Thai](http://gingerthaitaste.net/home/) has great Thai food in Carytown.

Other things to do while in Richmond:


* 
[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts](http://www.vmfa.state.va.us/Default.aspx)

* 
Go to [Carytown](http://www.carytownrva.com/). Lots of cool stuff there. [Chop Suey Books](http://www.chopsueybooks.com/) has a huge selection of used books, MTG, Warhammer, etc. Going to a midnight movie at [the Byrd](http://www.byrdtheatre.com/) is a MUST. [World of Mirth](http://www.worldofmirth.com/store/pc/home.asp) is a pretty quirky and fun place.

* 
Go to Belle Isle.

* 
Take a tour of [Legend Brewery](http://www.legendbrewing.com/). Also

* 
Go to [Lewis Ginter](http://www.lewisginter.org/). Especially at Christmas time.

* 
See a movie at the IMAX. Also

* 
See the [third practice electro-acoustic music festival](http://thirdpractice.org/3p11/index.html). It is a free festival at University of Richmond with tons of new music and some new commissions and is a very cool event. You should also go see contemporary super group eighth blackbird play too (either doing their own thing or at the festival).

1375119642.0,1jaevd,Anyone interested in a 3D printing boot camp class in RVA?,RepRapRVA,33,9,55,"I have been putting together a beginner-oriented boot camp-style class where students work collaboratively in an instructor-led environment to build from scratch the most recent generation of self-replicating 3D printers

The goal would be a four or five day boot camp with all parts and materials needed for the build included in the pricing of the class. The bot you would build would be a Prusa i3 variant with all of the most recent generation amenities including high quality extruder with brass hobbed bolt using the most recent generation MK-V hotend, precision cut steel smooth and threaded rods, an LCD-based control unit that can facilitate stand-alone 3D printing via the SD card slot, precision GT2 pulleys and timing belts, high quality and high torque steppers, etc.

The resulting 3D printer would be on par or more precise than the most recent generation of commercial printers such as the MakerBot Replicator 2. The benefits of the boot camp class should be fairly apparent, printing and adding updates and enhancements, etc. Based on the RepRap design, those printers are able to be ""reprinted"" for purposes of building a second printer for a friend or whatnot. The class would be delivered with each module of instruction on the overhead followed by lab exercise, to incrementally build, configure, tune, the class would be delivered using a hefty boot camp book with companion lab exercise manual and detailed bill of materials including supplier contact particulars that could be used by the student as takeaway reference material and as a guide to build additional 3D printers.

Based on the complexity of the subject

The inclusive price point for the class is probably $1995 - 2495 USD, both metric and SAE toolkit, SAE and metric allen wrenches etc), pay the week's rental fee for a conference room at a hotel etc. Students would only need to bring themselves and a laptop, everything else would be provided in the cost of the class once I get the financial model worked out. The only prerequisites for attendance would be Windows 7 experience and the ability to use a soldering iron. If you are female, the soldering iron experience requirement is waived :)

The class would be delivered from the perspective of a complete introduction to 3D printing, etc); the differences between additive 3D printing methods such as Fused Deposition Modeling and Stereolithography printing contrasted with subtractive methods of rapid prototyping such as CNC machining; an overview of the current state of the art in 3D printing, including a detailed tour of a functional Prusa i3 and all of its components, the theory behind stepper motor controls and and overview of firmware options (Marlin vs. Sprinter); connecting, testing, and flashing an Arduino-based control unit with the most recent Marlin firmware including hot end configuration, min/max temp variable configuration, compilation of the firmware and flashing it to the Arduino; building the actual bot itself using industry best practices; then both coarse and fine calibration using digital calipers to optimize the build process. Other perks of the class would be a detailed overview of the most recent generation of open source software suites used to control and manage the 3D printing process including both Pronterface and Repetier, [Blender3D](http://www.blender.org)

Is this something anyone in the RVA area would be interested in attending? The class would likely be limited to a maximum of 16 - 20 students based on the advanced nature of the class and need for one-on-one interaction between instructor and students.

If you would be interested in attending

PM me if you are interested with your email address so I can add you to a mailing list

I am shooting for the end of August right either right before school starts up again or during the second week of school

Given the demand for 3D printing forecast by the industry

If you ask me

1) Wolf/Goat - In Watermelon Sugar

I'm usually not that into the ensemble-driven, a Modest Mouse-esque sense of desperation, and all out rock. The lyrics are gorgeous and reflective, the harmonies are warm and inviting, and the slow-builds are incredible and natural. If you haven't seen these guys live yet, do yourself a favor and get your ass to a show. I PROMISE that you will be entranced by the time they're finished with the first song. 

Having a song that celebrates the late

2) White Laces - Moves

It took me a long time to get into this band. As much as I enjoy noisy, something I never really picked up from their studio recordings. With their latest record, however, White Laces have finally become the band they have always deserved to be as they fully embraced a newfound sense of melodicism and atmosphere. Within seconds of the opening track, it becomes apparent that the band has reached a new peak of accessibility. It sort of reminds me of the later-day Sonic Youth albums, with super-catchy guitar lines cascading around equally-catchy vocal melodies without neglecting the attack of their earlier material. I haven't been able to see them live since the record came out, but I'm sure its quite a sight to see. 

This record has gotten a bit of national attention

3) Black Girls - Hell Dragon

I've listened to this record so many times since its release that it's hard to believe that it only came out in January of last year. As much as I enjoy their high-energy live shows, culminating in an AMAZING homecoming show at the National. 

I know they're working on new material right now

4) Tungs/Heavy Midgets Split

No Richmond bands remind me more of the 90's indie-rock scene (Pavement, Guided by Voices, etc) than Heavy Midgets and Tungs. Luckily for me, they decided to do a split together. Though both bands take sort of different spin on fuzzed-out guitar jams, the record never feels like two completely different beasts. Instead it marks just about everything I love about the bygone Matador-records era of yesteryear. The production is evenly appropriately lo-fi at times, giving the release a very raw and immediate vibe. I love it.

A few of the Midgets also have a project called ""Age of Asparagus."" They are just as good. I hope they manage to get some recordings down in 2013. 

5) Cheyenne - Secrets of the Cheyenne

As much as Tungs, Cheyenne is holding up a far-different flag, as they resurrect the glory days of classic emo. Channelling Braid, Texas is the Reason, and old-Sunny Day Real Estate, while all-the-while adding their own mathy guitar-textures, this band has immediately picked up a following within a considerably short amount of time. Working as part of the tirelessly productive Subterranea Collective and recently picked up by Worthless Junk Records, so quickly. I cant wait to see where they head as 2013 rolls on.

I'm with the West End Volunteer Rescue Squad here in good ol' RVA.  the name may sound deceptive, and we need your help NOW!

Like I said, community training, disaster response, responder education...  The list goes on.  As a non-profit, we rely on donations to keep the lights on and the trucks on the street.

As we all know, and they've finally dried up. If we can't drum up some public financial support, we're done. Our doors will close, and a 52-year legacy of service to people will be over.

If we close

We provide job training and real-world experience to people who want to get into public safety, firefighters, police officers, nurses, and physicians have turned out of our ranks over the years.

We train people in the community in how to save lives through CPR and first aid training.

We respond to mass casualty incidents

But most of all, and spend our own money to get a lot of things we need, so that we can give time to help others.

My fellow Redditors, someone we trained may save your life, wherever you may be.

NBC12 in Richmond just did a story about us. It can be viewed here: http://www.nbc12.com/story/19057686/rescue-squad-needs-donations-to-stay-open

I'm a media guy for the VCU student organization

When we first had the idea of starting an on campus student &amp; community market that features businesses with a small and sustainable business model

We got some really encouraging responses from reddit, and one of our media guy (me) got hit by a car on his way home from a meeting, but with the help of the VCU (thank you green unity and the sustainability department.) and RVA community we were able to pull it off!

I'm not submitting this to reddit in an attempt to advertise 
(our organization is not going to profit off of this anyway)

That being said we are so excited to announce that our first Bazaar will be this Friday April 20th 10am-4pm @ Park Plaza (900 Park St.) and the Commons Plaza, to local artists, non-profits, and businesses.  To showcase Richmond’s creativity, an assortment of arts, crafts, foods, Upcycling workshops

original post text:
&gt; people in the fan and museum district might know pterodactyl.  these days, i can't find him.

&gt; has anyone seen him?!  here's a [picture](http://i.imgur.com/zGhbbP0) of him.  he has a typical brown tabby coat with a white chest &amp; underbelly.  there's a single white spot on his back and the pad of his front

&gt; anyone who knows this cat knows that he's very much a dog trapped inside a feline's body.  he's very people-friendly and will follow you around on a walk or jump in your car for a ride.  if you have any information
