I have done quite a few high school dances with great success but, or I take a look at our rhapsody account to see what is getting played.

By and large

This was further evidenced by a statement that my daughter made today concerning her prom.  When I asked her how it went

Her statement is very telling.  When playing in bars and clubs

Kids on the other hand don't begin to develop their own musical identity until around the onset of puberty.  Before that, you will associate a soundtrack to go with those memories.  Music makes and enhances memories.  

To teenagers, there are exceptions.  I can still fill a dance floor with California Love or Lil John's ""Get Low"" but by and large, I only play music less than a year old.  I have never once received a request for the Black Eyed Peas, S&amp;M by Rihanna, or anything else hot just a couple years ago at a high school dance.

So, that is ""good music"".  By doing this, you would be helping these kids make memories that will last a lifetime and, you will also increase your bookings.  Also, go easy on the remixes and, a little scratching will make you DJ Royalty to these kids.

""What decks do you use?"" I ask tentatively.

""Oh

*sigh*

""Of course you do..."" At this point I'm already somewhat indifferent, ""Are you using Virtual DJ?"".

""Nah

Windows. Media. Player.

Not only can these guys not be arsed to learn a ""DJ"" program as simple as VDJ, bro! Our new DJ laptop totally just arrived, dudebro! I'm not sure what software to use, broman brosefstein,  but it looks like this Windows Media Player came pre-loaded! Score, bro bro macbroferton!""

Fucking fuck.

So, with a pause in-between as they furiously double-clicked to the next track. 

But hey

Their crowning achievement, but rather the fact that they were using my mixer to ""mix"" the EQ - one of the guys even had my headphones on.

Am I angry that they used my stuff without even asking? 

Well

That's right. They were using my EQ, they were using my headphones, through which nothing was playing but total silence. 

Wut?

But wait there's more:

They expect to get paid. 

They expect to get paid more than me.

Hold the fucking phone.

I don't think I have ever been so insulted in my entire life.

Club owners/managers/etc, making excuses as to why they should get less money, and so on. The fact is, you are not paying for the one, two, three-hour set the DJ plays, you are paying for their **experience** - you are paying them for the hours and hours they spent practicing so that they could reach a point where they are able to hold a dancefloor. 

So please

How in the ever-living fuck do these guys think they should get paid more than the resident DJ (who practices ""real mixing"" no less than two hours a day) for LITERALLY doing nothing but pressing play?

Again, but I'd love to hear your stories to know I'm not the only one experiencing this sort of bullshit.

TL;DR: Guys want to play at my club. Guys have one laptop. Guys use Windows Media Player. Guys expect to be paid more than me

1332877150.0,rgauo,UPDATE: So I just got a job as a strip club DJ.,thirteenthirty7,176,11,100,"***EDIT: I just found a video from Saturdays Bass and Titties Breakbeat event



So last week I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/r0tff/so_i_just_landed_a_job_at_a_new_strip_club_in/) thread about a new gig I landed. 

Although I could have, but Traktor just seems waay too easy, I see why it gets haters. But overall I do like it and am getting used to it quick. 

Anyways, thank you to whoever posted that! I had a bunch of new music, and a new controller and I was ready to go. 

I showed up at noon on my first day

I talked to the boss and bartender. ""Um...yeah

The night before there was some big event going on (this club is in South Beach and it was the Winter Music Conference / Ultra music fest weekend in Miami). The subs blew and the place cleared out because of the bad sound. 

It should be worth noting here that I graduated Full Sail 6 months ago with a degree in Show Production and Touring. (the live music degree).

I went in back switched up some stuff on the sub amps, which is the side facing the dining area and bar, much more important. 

I crawled under the stripper stage and learned how it was all hooked up. The stage was built around the subs and absolutely cannot be replaced or pulled out easily without pulling up the whole stage. 

By the end of the day i had 2/4 subs working again, EQ, Crossover, and a few other units all completely retuned with no red flashing lights. They had a 'sound guy' from the other very well established club in Orlando come down and they were going to rent some external self powered subs that night, and he was going to hook them up. 

The next day I came in to DJ again during the day and saw the 2 rented subs. sitting out. They said they didnt work because the console didnt have any more xlr outputs for them. (the fuck?) 

I went in back

He brought em back, I had it sounding better than it sounded the day the club opened 3 months ago. This was thursday night.

On friday the club had a big event with a bunch of female DJ's. I came in that night about midnight with some friends (a few guys and girls, till I showed up. I went in back and bumped up everything just little on the crossover and got lots more volume level. It was officially a bangin loud as fuck party now. 

We all got wasted and had a blast hanging out with the DJ's and dancers. The bosses were happy I got it louder and sounding even better (while stupid drunk may I add lol) and the DJ's were happy i got the place bumpin and the party started. 

Another win. 

The next night was Saturday. I went to see Deadmau5 and went to the club afterwards to hang out for a bit. We had a big event with a bunch of breakbeat Dj's (icey, etc..). They brought their own system and hooked it up with ours. Again the night was a huge success. My and my gf hung out there a bit and had a blast getting drunk and throwing money at the dancers all night. 



In the end, then prob will get some night shifts. I guess I'm also the sound guy there too. 

As for my actual DJ'ing, the bartenders liked it, and the door guy liked it. I did a huge mix of house, top 40, ghetto rap, some rock, old booty bass

I cant believe this all happened and I guess I have a new job as a resident DJ and sound guy at the nicest Cabaret and Steakhouse in Miami.

Thank you all soo much for all the great info I got on my last thread it definitely helped me DJ exactly the way they were looking for


TL;DR: I saved the club from certain disaster the day the Winter Music Conference started and am now a resident DJ in South Beach. Years of hard work has finally paid off. And bass and titties.

Practice until you dont make yourself and your friends cringe when you play. Experiment with mixes, its what happens before you are mediocre, and WAY before you are good and its part of learning.

I say this in good spirit as a guy who has been doing this for 15 years next year- strictly dance music (house/techno/minimal/breaks/deep) and a bit of classic hip hop.

It's blatantly obvious that a lot of people posting such posts clearly don't have a clue as to what's involved (gear &amp; what to learn) ... and that's fine. Just dandy. We all have to start somewhere. 


What strikes me though is that SO many of these posts/people have  done next to zero amount of research themselves into the matter before asking for it to be spoon fed to them.


Is my thinking skewed when i believe that if you really are interested in or passionate about getting into mixing, forums etc etc that will outline, explain and detail what's involved so you could at least arm yourself with some elementary knowledge on the matter.

I've been buying his records for more than 10 years and he's one of the few names that will sell me a record without hearing it.  I was SO excited to hear him at the Intonation Festival in Chicago in 2005 (this became the Pitchfork festival a few years later).  To say I was disappointed is an understatement.  Every ""song"" he played started groovy

About a year later he was playing at a club called Sonotheque and I decided to try again.  Maybe his Intonation Festival performance was just a bad day.  Maybe this will be better.  

Not at all.  He mixed genres and styles and train wrecked to the point that 30 minutes into his set more than half the crowd had gone elsewhere.  I stood there with my drink in utter disbelief.  Not only was he mixing poorly

Skip to new years eve 2011-2012.  He's back in Chicago and playing at Smart Bar.  It's been years since that first performance I saw of his and I think ""SOMEBODY must have told him that he's terrible at DJing by now.  He HAS to have improved.  Nobody can gig this long and not get better.""  

How wrong I was.  Perhaps nobody is willing to tell him that he's fucking terrible.  Perhaps because he's a little insane he just doesn't get it.  But he was playing terrible music

In my opinion the core of the DJ bio should be summed up in a short, influences and key gigs that brought you to where you are today, but it's really important to get your message across in the first paragraph. 

Think about it from an employers perspective, this guy is top 40""... it's the same for people going through hundreds of pages online. Same for the newspaper - nobody reads beyond the first paragraph unless you hook them or they were already interested.



Cliches to avoid:

&gt; ""grew up listening to his parents' music collection""

* What kid didn't? Always remember it's more important that we know what you play **now**

&gt; ""bought his first decks/CDJs/software""

* Cool! Classic transaction

&gt; ""his eclectic music selection includes tech house

* ""eclectic"" is a very relative word which, it's even more important for you to use adjectives to *describe* your style in depth! Often it's hard to pin yourself down - asking a friend to describe your style of DJing can be very helpful.

&gt; ""hard to pin down his style""

* This is just about the worst thing your can write that isn't racist. Also I just listened to your mix and No

&gt; ""classically trained musician""

* Unless this is backed up by something like a university or orchestra name in the same sentence

&gt; ""knows how to read a crowd"" / ""tells a story with music""

* This is like a busdriver saying he knows how to move around in traffic - it's one of the most basic aspects of the job. A better message is that you know how to whip the crowd into a frenzy

&gt; ""Shared the stage with [insert famous DJ]""

* You *should* absolutely list famous DJs you opened for, if you've DJed with a famous DJ from a vastly different genre, listing them might confuse people.

&gt; ""started playing friends' house parties and empty warehouses""

* This is fine if you're starting out, or else write something really absurd and off-the-wall that displays my personality and music tastes rather than lack of professional experience.

**TL;DR It is more important to be remembered and show personality than to make a list of the same chronological stages every DJ goes through. DON'T FUCKING FORGET TO SAY WHAT YOU PLAY**

Finally

**If anyone has examples of great DJ bios that stand out please post them.**

As this sub-reddit grows exponentially (congrats on 10k) we are constantly seeing new and old DJs alike joining our community who are not familiar with some of the policies of /r/DJs and I am talking specifically about this one from the sidebar:

&gt; **Please think twice before posting following topics. Instead consider searching for and reading older threads.**

&gt; * ""What music should I play?""

Over the last week there have been no less than six posts breaking the ~~unspoken~~ *constantly spoken* rule of do not ask for music. Instead of just complaining about it I figured it was time to do something about it and first explain why these questions are looked down upon and then explain what you can do to find your own music without asking. 

**Why the Question is Frowned Upon**

* If you don't care about the music you're playing neither will the audience. 

When DJ's spend hours digging through music they have countless ""Ah-hah!"" moments where that 1 minute preview catches their attention and they just have to have the track. That moment when you know you need to have it is the same moment that innumerable possible transitions and mix combinations go through your mind and it is what connects the DJ to their music. That connection is a part of the passion that we all share for the music we're playing when we're behind the decks and without that connection to the music your set is going to be boring and you're going to be no more exciting than a radio playlist. 

If you're playing someone else's library it will be insincere and you won't have the intimate knowledge of the music or the same passion for it. I might as well rent a jukebox if you don't know and love the music you're playing. Doing the leg work and finding those gems yourself is a key part of knowing your library.

* Every DJ needs to have their own sound and digging for music is not only an important skill but it's a deeply personal experience. 

As more and more of our role behind the decks is automated and simplified one of the last remaining things that separates the great DJs from the mediocre DJs is the music they're playing and the connection they have to it. Anyone can go out and download the Beatport Top 100 and play a set but it is the amazing DJs who take you on a journey with their music (sorry for the cliché) and actually help you get lost in the music.

When two DJs playing the same genre are booked back to back on the same stage it would be ridiculous if they both played the exact same songs

* If you need to ask what music to play it's safe to assume you've taken a gig you're not prepared for or equipped for and you can read my article on DJTechTools as to why that's a bad idea: http://www.djtechtools.com/2012/11/23/taking-dj-gigs-outside-of-your-normal-genre/

**How to Dig For Music**

It would be unfair of me to say ""dig for your own music"" and not at least give you some pointers on how to go about it. I will explain my method for digging on Beatport but keep in mind there are lots of different ways to dig for music going back to it being a deeply personal experience. 

1 - I go to beatport.com open the house section or tech-house section (my genres) and browse through the new releases or search for artists or labels I know I already like. The new releases are a better place to start than the charts because by the time a track hits the Top 10 for a genre it is probably already over saturated. Now

2 - When I find a track that catches my attention (let's use Jo Manji - Long Train for this example) I have a number of options after I add it to my cart:

* I can click the label (Funktion Recordings) and browse their house releases as most will likely be similar and through that I will find not only tracks but other artists to use as jumping points.
* I can check Jo Manji's releases to see if anyone remixed Long Train and checkout tracks by those remixers.
* I can checkout other labels that Jo Manji has released on for similar tracks and artists.
* I can use the Beatbot Recommendations section of Beatport to see if it found anything similar.
* And finally I can see if Long Train is included in any releases or DJ charts to find similar songs.

3 - When I find a similar track by those methods

That's all without leaving Beatport... You need to remember that everything on Beatport for the most part can be clicked: the artist, remixer, and so on. These links are like breadcrumbs for you to follow and the further you follow them the more gems you will find burried deep in the catalogue. 

**Where to Find Music**

* Beatport - www.Beatport.com - the world's largest DJ and electronic music site with high quality MP3s and WAVs.
* ZipDJ - www.ZipDJ.com - a record pool for professional DJs with high quality MP3s ([My Review of ZipDJ](http://www.djforums.com/forums/showthread.php?3098-ZipDJ-The-Full-Review))
* DJCity - www.DJCity.com - another record pool for DJs again with high quality MP3s
* Juno - www.JunoDownload.com - dance mp3 download store with over 2 million mp3 and wav tracks available and thousands more added each week.

I invite everyone to share their methods for track digging below and their sources of music (please no illegal sources).

When I tried to blow them off or I didn't play the song right at that instant they got so angry and threw a small fit, one girl proceeded to give me the middle finger right in my face for an entire minute until she got bored and left. 

This whole experience just really made me think about how spoiled and entitled attractive women can be. And when they don't get what they want - because they usually get what they want all the time - they blow a childish fit. It pissed me off to no end.

I've played for these guys in the past and they were always reluctant to pay cause they never saw DJs as essential for parties. They were throwing a big party and asked for me to play. I told them my normal fee and they said they'd get back to me. Oddly enough I found the poster for their party in a Reddit post and it had a different DJ on it. I was told that they went with him cause he offered to do it for free. Luckily

New DJs, I can't afford to do anything for free. I'm aware that this is a competitive market but doing things for free won't get you anywhere. Eventually you will want money and you will have a bitch of a time trying to get any of your regulars to pay you.

Also, it's insulting to take their job because you offered to do it for free. People are cheap, they will choose the guys doing it for free over the ones that are talented.

Doing a friends party for free is ok. Taking a paying job from another DJ and doing it for free is not ok.

I looked for some places but I didn't see things really laid out into as small of pieces as I would have liked. 

So here is my attempt

Song selection
&gt;Picking the next song:  genre - era - instrumentation - key - ""feel""- bpm
&gt;&gt;Picking next hour's song:  Dance floor energy - getting between each of the above - bpm transitions


Beat matching 
&gt;beat - phase - acapellas - multiple decks


Transitions
&gt;When: end of song - into break - out of break - middle of track at the verse
&gt;&gt;How: cross fader - line faders - eq knobs/filter - slam

Creating Elements
&gt;sample portion and play it under/over new track to create a new segment/phrase - used acapella to create new segments - use loops to create new segment - use duplicate track
Mash- make a new song combining - Making your own buildups/drops

Playing Out

I know most of you here hate Top 40 and I'm ok with that but what I don't understand is why are some of you accepting Top 40 gigs when you hate the genre.

I wrote this a few days ago but I feel this needs to be reiterated:
What if you went to a Hardstyle event and found out that the promoter hired a DJ that couldn't give two shits about Hardstyle and played Top 40 all night. Imagine how disappointed the people who came for Hardstyle would be. Now imagine you are a Hardstyle DJ. This guy took what could have been your job all because he wanted a gig regardless of what genre was required.

When you accept a Top 40 gig without being familiar with the genre

Now I realize that most of the people caught in these situations are new to Djing. You have to realize that if you are to stick with Dubstep/Happycore/etc you aren't gonna get much work. You aren't helping yourself by accepting gigs for genres you are not familiar with.

Also, and watching the charts to see what's rising and what's falling. If you are gonna play a genre, commit to it, don't ever half-ass it.

So how does one avoid these situations?

Ask the host what genre needs to be played BEFORE you accept the gig. It's that simple. If he asks for Bmore Club and you play DnB just tell him that you aren't the right DJ for the job

Also

Just my two cents on the situation.",,t5_2rddy,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/oqazc/im_a_insert_edm_genre_here_dj_and_i_hate_top_40/

1374077873.0,1ihs3g,[Class with Omers] How to Get Gigs.,omers,77,11,51,"Ok folks

It is time for another omers mega post! These are almost always inspired by pure frustration with repetitive posts on /r/DJs and /r/Beatmatch and this is no exception; it is time to revisit the question on a lot of people’s minds: “How do I break out of the bedroom?”

## Are You Ready for an Audience?

This question is one you can only answer yourself; there is no objective way to measure when someone is ready to start playing in clubs or at raves or wherever it is you want to play. The most important thing you need is confidence

Some other things you should consider:

* **Are you ready to adapt to changing dancefloors?** If the dance floor isn’t feeling what you’re playing are you able to recognize that and take your set in a different direction? 
* **Are you willing to spend a huge chunk of time digging for music regularly?** In clubs you need to constantly be adding new music both new and classic. Keeping things fresh week to week will keep you sane and the dance floor packed. In this day and age record labels release new singles to YouTube the day they come out so people in the club don’t have to wait for the radio or club DJs to expose them to new music and you need to keep up with it because I guarantee it will happen where someone requests a song that came out literally that day.
* **Can you troubleshoot common DJ problems?** When you are in front of an audience you need to deal with problems as simple as a loose cable to as catastrophic as a dead deck and do it all as quickly as possible without interrupting the flow of the dance floor. Knowing how your gear works and how to fix issues with it and knowing at least the basics of the rest of the audio chain is a must when you start playing live. 

## Gear

Lots of people ask if their controller is appropriate for clubs or if they will need to use what the club provides. The answer is: it depends on the club. You should always ask before accepting a gig what the gear situation is and if you should or are expected to bring your own gear. 

Yes, whatever it takes) because the transition from controller to CDJ is not as easy as you might think; you might think you don’t use visual cues on your laptop but you're likely to get a rude awakening when they're gone.

## Self Promotion in the Digital Age

It’s a different world out there today than it was when I started DJing

**Facebook:** If you do not have a Facebook account

**Posting Mixes:** Go get yourself a Soundcloud account and a Mixcloud account and start posting mixes (remember to cross-post to Facebook) and start pushing them on /r/Mixes and forums and wherever you can get a listen. Every promoter and club owner worth their salt will want to hear a mix when you approach them and they'll notice the number of listens your mixes have (hint: 0 is a bad thing).

A note on mixes: make it clear to promoters and club owners who you send your mix to that the mix is a representation of your skill but you're adaptable and you will apply the skill in the mix to music appropriate for their venue and they should not assume you always sound like your mixes (unless you do in which case you have bigger problems and you need to go back to “are you adaptable” above.)

## Get the Fuck Out of the House

This isn't the “ok

Promoters and owners are way more likely to book people they've seen before so get out and have a drink, and party hard (without passing out in the lobby (that never looks good)). 

If you don’t go out to clubs or parties under your own steam just to enjoy the atmosphere why should they book you? If you were a promoter would you book one of those “I don't like clubs

If you're a shy introverted person you're going to have a bad time as a DJ so you better work on that (Rye helps).

## Lets Start Looking for Gigs

So you think you're ready, and you've been out to some parties… It’s time to actually start talking to promoters and trying to book gigs.

There are lots of different ways to approach this task and each is suited to different personalities, for example, targeting specific promoters instead of blanketing the city with your mix CDs means it will likely take you longer to book gigs but you're more likely to book gigs you’ll actually enjoy.

An incomplete list of way to approach promoters:

* **The talk to everyone/I'm the shit method:** This is exactly what it sounds like
* **The roundabout:** Make friends with other DJs instead of promoters and make it known you’re a DJ. Eventually one of them is likely to introduce you to a promoter or if they like you enough ask you fill in for them when they need to go out of town for grandpa’s 8th wedding. This method lets you target specific venues and scenes and is less abrasive so you're less likely to piss people off by coming off as pushy but it takes some patience. 
* **The job applicant:** In this method you either approach promoters and owners with or drop deliver during off-hours a well prepared press kit complete with headshot and mix CD showcasing your Photoshop skills on the cover. It’s quite likely 95% of your painstakingly prepared press kits are going in the garbage without a second glance but the same thing can be said about your resume
* **The do nothing:** This method involves posting mixes and being active on the internet and hoping a promoter in your city notices and contacts you. This method will require a lot of patience and may never pay off… Don’t do this.

There is one secret you need to know about getting gigs and it applies to a lot of things in life:

&gt; **It’s far more important who you know than what you know.**

So get out there and meet people.

1346175879.0,yyzgm,A lot of people ask about tag teams. Here is our setup.,omers,76,9,40,"We do a 3-way tag set once a month and I figured I would explain it for people.

First

The explanation...

**Mixer 2** 

- Has the Kontrol S4's master output plugged in to Ch1 Line
- Has Out 1 &amp; 2 from the Serato SL1 plugged in to Ch2 and Ch4 Line
- The Tech 12 controls the SL1s Deck 1
- The master out (RCA) leads to Mixer 1.

**Mixer 1**

- Has the master output of Mixer 2 plugged in to Ch1 Line
- Has the Serato SL3s Left/Right plugged in to Ch2 and Ch4 Line
- The SL3s decks are controlled by the CDJ 900s
- Runs XLR out to the amp rack.
- Runs 1/4"" out to the monitors.
- Runs RCA out from the REC to the SL3 Aux In for recording.

**Examples**

- To run Kontrol S4 audio Ch1 needs to be up on Mixer 1 and Mixer 2 and both Mixer 1 &amp; 2 must have their master volumes up.
- To run audio from CDJ2 only Ch4 on Mixer 1 and the Mixer 1 master need to be up.

**How we work together**

- All three DJs by the nature of the setup can mix at the same time (against the monitors) so anything is possible.
- Generally, and the S4 may have a vocal loop going.
- Each DJ is responsible for keeping anything they add to the mix beatmatched. If you brought in the newest track
- We each signal each other if we are going to drop someone else's signal on the mixer we are responsible for or if we wish for part of a track to solo without anything over top. We also signal when we're ready for someone to drop their track so ours can take over (or we reach over and do it ourselves).
- Working together we can EQ between two mixers as we're all experienced. For example

The real key is knowing your partners, and having fun. The more experiance each person has both alone and together also goes a long way.

1331162729.0,qmget,Professionalism,,69,7,25,"After seeing a fair amount of threads on here recently that deal with the issues that arise in attempting to be/being a professional DJ

Getting Gigs:

How do you get gigs?  It's a weird thing, and eventually you'll meet people.  Play a shitload of house parties, and network there, this is why facebook and whatnot is great.  Maybe you'll meet a dude who works at a local club and can get you opening spots, who knows.  If you know enough people opportunities will arise.

Turning down gigs:

I know this is an enviable position to have, bad experiences at said club) but other than that you should never be the guy who says no.

Cancelling:

Never ever flake out on shit without a really good reason and good notice

Getting paid:

The debate on wether or not to get paid when you start out is pretty big, once your name is out there I would say to get at least 200 and 100ish in tab, but this varies widely by city.

The next part of getting paid is when; this happens before the event.  You either get paid by cheque a week or two before so you know it clears

Another thing to think of is gear rental fees.  You paid good money for your stuff, not a rental shop) or make sure you've got it insured and you're getting rental fees (charge them a lot) for it (insurance is key, imagine how pissed you'd be if another guy ruined a few thousand worth of gear).

At the gig:

This is a big thing about professionalism for me personally and something that I feel everyone should hold close and dear:  You are paid to do something, ever phone in a gig, and don't treat a gig like it's beneath you; if you said you'd play it you're going to do the best job you can.  This also means staying relatively sober, there's a time for partying: after your set.  While getting wasted is a lot of fun I'd recommend to limit your alcohol to one or two drinks and no more, it can really effect you.  Stay the fuck away from all illegal substances (a bit of pot is ok if you're a seasoned professional at it), because they can drastically screw you up without you being aware of it.

The big thing to remember is don't get an inflated opinion of yourself and think that relatively lame, you might have shit going on in your personal life but you ignore that and do the best you can.  Nobody at the club cares that your dog just died, they came out for a good night and you'll give it to them.  Also, really consider what it means to be sick.  I was at an event once with a drummer who had a bucket next to his kit because he got food poisoning that day.  The dude was vomiting and managed to play a one hour set, and he didn't sound bad either.  That's the kind of guy who will get hired a lot because he's got amazing levels of commitment.

The last thing to remember is that since DJing has become more and more accessible it's easier and easier to replace you.  If you aren't a complete professional it's pretty easy for an owner to get someone else

I've been reading this subreddit for a while and see that many here fully embrace the newer technologies, and to you I say welcome to our world. You are in for a hell of a lot of good times.

What I'm curious about though is why do so many new DJs don't feel the need to learn to mix the old fashion way, I'm not sure I wouldn't have taken advantage of it. That said, I am so grateful I got to know the days when DJing meant putting a record on a platter, cueing it up in the headphone, adjusting the pitch control and blending the tracks in &amp; out, while maintaining a visual connection with the room.

What I'm suggesting here is that if you're a new DJ and have the means to practice mixing music manually, do it! Even if you only do it at home, for your own education/culture/experience, what you'll get out of it can't be measured. Actually, I really feel you'd be missing out on the whole DJ experience if you don't.

EDIT: I would even add that learning how to mix manually will enhance anyone's capabilities

**TL;DR: I think any DJ's experience isn't complete if they don't

**EDIT 2:** Thanks everyone for participating in this discussion. I'm personally very pleased with seeing how involved everyone is with their craft, it's pretty safe to say we are all collectively making things go forward.

1336303474.0,t9kxu,TIL that beatmatching at college-parties is not required,php_TANKER,88,24,116,"I usually play at clubs and private parties. EDM is dominant. I have some ""mainstream"" music that works at places where people just wanna hear their favorite songs. 

So my friend called me up last morning and asked if I wanted to gig at a college party with him

We got there, he just ""hard"" dropped every track without any timing at all. Sometimes it sounded horrible, sometimes decent. People still danced because they didn't care. 

When I played, they danced and went crazy and whatnot. After a while though, a lot of people went up to the booth and said things like ""this is too slow"" or ""put on some more music faster"" after I had one song play for more than 1.5 mins. I was confused and asked my buddy what the deal was. He said, just mix in everything fast and don't care about the technical part, so I tried that and guess what? People started whooing and jumping. I was flabbergasted, I had never realized how much people love SHITTY mixing. I told my buddy: That was the worst mixover I have ever done. He answered: Yeah but that's what they want. 

I am probably never playing at a party like that again. I don't see the point in bringing expensive professional equipment when you might as well bring two iPods and plug into the PA. 

So guys

Do you have enought pop-music? Do you know what people listen to? Are you prepared to throw your soul as a DJ away and mix like a ten-year old on crack? 

If yes

Sorry if I sound like I have a grudge or anything

- The owner walked over to the house pa mixer early on in the night

- I learned the value of Facebook as a short notice promotional tool.

Thank god I'm a technical guy, because I don't know how someone who wasn't technical was gonna figure that stuff out.

So I figured I'd share my success (in my opinion anyways!) story of creating interest where there was none before. Currently me and two of my DJ friends host parties with an average attendance of 150 people

Ok, although old school DJ for around 6 years. He offers to teach me and I love the idea because of my passion for music and it's a new medium in which to play with. He gives me his old set of cdjs and I learn with no visual cues etc.

 Fast forward a bit and we're both having tons of fun just playing for each other, and partied with friends in clubs and noticed that the house DJ's kinda sucked at the basics. trainwrecking, scratching with the track that was playing, playing songs multiple times etc. anyways this gave us the confidence we needed to start a little night in our town. so we talked to the owner of a small local bar, said we wanted one night, we'd advertise ourselves, charge a 5 dollar cover and she'd make a killing on alcohol sales. she agreed after a month of pestering. so our first night of the most basic setup type shows we get about 70 people

we did that around 3 times and on the third time we actually put our tiny little pub to capacity with 110 people. the words ""sold out"" on the door made me pretty damn proud. so word of mouth spreads that these nights are a fun change from the nothing that goes on here but people are now complaining about not getting in. we decide to change venues to a conference center in a local hotel. we put a lot of the money we make into bigger speaker rentals because our tiny set will sound like an ipod dock in this giant space. we also start renting some lights and lazers. so we throw a few parties in this place and people are loving it

 I realize this isn't the same as breaking into an established culture/club or getting a weekly spot as our shows are more like every month and a half. But for me getting people interested is my success. 

ummm TLDR: I'm a proud little DJ who can't tell a story for the life of me.

Here's how it went down. Last night after the drag show, and is typically drunk. I know other Club DJs know this feel. I was not ready to hear a request for Tammy Wynette or Beyonce with a full bladder so I quickly ducked out before she could make it to the booth. 

When I got back a full 3 minutes later, so what *was* playing was stuttering and skipping. She was so drunk that she had no idea I was in the booth yelling at her, and when I finally physically pushed her off my decks she began berating me.

The rage. Oh

Here's what came out of my mouth next: ""I don't come to your place of business and slap the dicks out of your mouth- don't try to come up here and do MY job."" Grabbed the mic: ""Security to the DJ booth."" She was kicked out, but otherwise everything went alright. It could have been so much worse.

I've been DJing professionally for quite a few years now. I've had some good gigs and some not so good gigs. I don't claim to be a superstar but I am content with my position on the ladder. I get paid to do something I love.

I have a lot of time for people that are a) just getting into DJing and b) DJ simply for the love of the music. I will try and help or advise anyone that was help and advice as did my peers when I was starting out.

That being said

Over the past week one such person has caught my attention. I have him as a friend on Facebook through some loose connection. He's the kind of guy that if I put up something about Traktor he'll reply with ""Traktors shit use Serato"" like he's got some form of knowledge on the subject.

A couple of months back he was on another DJ I knows status

My gripe with him started last week. He put up a link to a mix he'd put on Soundcloud. Nothing wrong with that except for on his profile picture he'd put up a shot of some CDJ2000's and DJM900. I commented on the link saying

Then this week I get a message from him asking for support for his new DJ page on Facebook. On there he has a sound clip of 'him' dropping a track with Datsik at a London club on Friday night. 

After some digging I find that Datsik was actually in Houston

Now I know I shouldn't let this wind me up and the sensible thing to do would be to just delete him from Facebook but I have an overwhelming urge to out him and his lies.

[Source](http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/06/pioneer-cdj-2000nexus-updates-the-flagship-dj-player/)

&gt;""Beat sync renders the decks useless... but any DJ with credibility wouldn t really want to stand behind these in a club?!""
&gt;incorrect.
&gt;
&gt;i'm really tired of this trope, and it's not what people come to the club for. Freeing up your time to do more live remixing, etc. is a Big Deal.
&gt;
&gt;Shit DJs will be shit DJs always and will have ways to lazy themselves out of having to mix properly. I'm glad they'll have the option of sync, but spend a LOT of time tending to them as even the tightest beatmatch on 6% eventually drifts enough to be audible.
&gt;
&gt;Sync is a tool that lets you reduce that load. It won't always do it right
&gt;
&gt;I've been at this 10+ years now. I've played vinyl, I've played in ableton, and I can say that I welcome every new improvement and opportunity to do new and exciting things with open arms. It's not a threat, it doesn't diminish the fun I have or the quality of what I do.
&gt;
&gt;This whole sync argument reeks of people trying to create an exclusive club to keep new people out. I've seen the same exact voices cropping up bitching about pioneer's new low cost controllers/standalone units and saying that the barrier to entry for DJing is getting too low - well GOOD. I hope it does. I hope that people who never thought about DJing before start flooding in and kicking ass. I hope they run circles around all the folks who keep complaining about every new innovation as the downfall of the art and I hope that they drive new technology and ideas into the scene.
&gt;
&gt;I just hope they don't play le7els - that's not too much to ask

As I continued to practice though, 2a, 3b, etc) instead of what would sound good next.

It got to the point where mixed in key was basically picking the songs for me and I was growing more and more afraid of going outside the box and picking a song that wasn't one step away on the camelot system. 

It became so frustrating I didn't practice for quite awhile because every time I sat down to make a mix it either sounded the exact same as the one the day before or the songs

Two days ago I was fed up with it all and had had enough. I got 30 some odd new songs and decided I wasn't going to touch mixed in key and just trust my ear (I've had countless years of musical training, instead of letting a program decide for me.

I made the best mix I've made in months, and had an amazing jam out time. Is the mix perfect, no. Am I looking forward to attempting it again, abso-freaking-lutely. I had so much fun yesterday and felt so free, expressing the songs as feelings more than in key copies of each other. It was so...much...fun and felt *right* again.

But I also know him, so I made sure I had plenty of dance-remixes of Crystal Castles, Arcade Fire, 2 Door Cinema Club... pretty much a Hype Machine remixes greatest hits album.

I also made sure to get remixes of the Animal House songs. Imagine if Madeon remixed the AH soundtrack

So I would start with something like ""Shout"", then I'd automix a bunch of songs I wasn't as familiar with (but where liked by the host) and hang out, swim, eat, drink, then I'd return to the deck and do it again with ""Hold On, I'm a-Comin'"".

1319225611.0,lk9l0,Rules that every DJ should live by,JoelQuest,78,40,76,"Rules that all DJ's should live by - by Joel Quest

**1. You are not there for you.  You are there for them.**
If you're not paying attention to who is there and how they are reacting to what you are playing, hour to hour at the same place.  Just because you downloaded track you can't stop listening to, it might not be the right time for that when you go on.   Listen to what they want to hear.

**Edit 1.5 Never have a setlist**
NEVER have a pre-programmed set.  You really don't know what you are gonna play.  What if the previous DJ played your bombtrack?  What if they're just not responding to your tracks?  You'll need to improvise.   Clients ask me all the time what I am going to play first

**2. Be able to play on all kinds of equipment**
If you work hard, playing on other equipment isn't that hard.  You should be able to figure out how a mixer works in less than 20 seconds in the dark.

**3. Flow is everything**
 if the guy before you is playing house

**4. Learn to beatmatch by ear. **
I don't give a shit what the software does or can do.  Chemistry student learn how atoms bond with each other down to theory level.  Of course there are computer programs available that can do all the calculating and measuring for Chemists

If you don't bother to learn how to do it by ear, mix, loop and drop into tracks more intuitively and more successfully than people who rely on SYNC.  Plus, I'm quicker on the draw than someone who simply relies on software or other visual aids.  More importantly, if something goes wrong, I can fix a problem much faster than someone who can't rely on their ears.  Screengazing is a crutch and using it will limit your potential. 

**5. Programming is everything**
Playing the right music at the right time for the right people is the MOST important part of your skillset.  If your tracks are awesome and your flow or timing sucks, you have no business playing the most requested tracks of the night.  Your job is to warm up the audience for whomever is playing prime-time.   Do this well enough, and you'll be asked to headline.   That being said, also be aware of what time it is.  It isn't always a good time for your favorite tracks.  

**6. Charge what your worth**
Yeah, sifting through shitty tracks online, learning how to beatmatch, buying equipment, playing in dive bars, spending hours promoting ourselves, getting ripped off by shitty promoters and owners.  That means,  we want top dollar for appearing in a club.  Just because you've never dreamed of earning 200.00 in one day doesn't mean you should go undercut another DJ and tell the owner you will DJ for drink tickets.  Have some respect for yourself and your craft.

**7. Respect the booth**
If it isn't your equipment

**8. Close your mouth and open your ears**
 Dj's love to pick each other apart, try to enjoy your drink and conversation with your friends.  Listen, you might learn a thing or two.    

**9. Support the industry or it won't support you.**
Just because you know how to download an illegal copy of Virtual DJ and Fruityloops and a sample pack doesn't mean you are a producer.  Learn to compress your own drums.  Tweak your own basslines.  Sync your own vocals.  After you've spent thousands of hours learning to produce and jumped through all of hoops you need to jump through to get signed by a label

In addition to this, they may get dropped from a label or get discouraged altogether thinking no one likes their work.   

**10. Buy quality
My mobile DJ rig costs as much as a new car.  I could easily be a DJ for FAR less

**11.  Pay it forward**
* I'm passing along things that were taught to me, the faster the art of DJing will lose respect as a whole.    It will garner you respect, though make sure you don't teach all of your soldiers all of your tricks... or you will fall victim to yourself.


**EDIT**
For clarification : I am a full time professional DJ and I make a good living doing it.  It's been a lot of work.  I started 12 years ago in the clubs in Philadelphia and Atlantic City and have played alongside many talented individuals.  I now live in Chicago and perform wedding weekly for brides and grooms who want something other than the status quo cheeseball DJ.  I started out on turntables, they are great for starters. but you can only go so far and do so much with them, and they are not professional grade devices.

I have been DJing for a few years now, and I'll occasionally let them use my sound equipment for parties as well. Recently, one of my buddies borrowed my gear to play a party that was going to be just him and possibly one other dj that I hadn't met. I decided to stop by to say what's up, and what I saw bothered me.

[rant]

The dj that I hadn't met before used Traktor, but the way he utterly dominated the flow of each song with a cacophony of beatmashes/gater/filter/anything else you can imagine combos was unreal. Each button controlled several layers of effects, which were then used with a very ""more is more"" kind of approach. It was even more awkward because the way he was cutting between tracks didn't seem to take the phrasing of either track into account -- just hit sync, and cut levels/swap/slather with effects.

Then I thought to myself, people are allowed to do things that I don't agree with or like."" But it gets worse.

My friend and I have similar setups, the fucking dude grabs the outgoing levels slider on my mixer and starts beat chopping. While I'm playing. Instant confrontation. Obviously I told him to back the fuck off, which he did, but then he comes back with the argument that I should ""make myself useful"", that I'm not ""doing anything"" when I just stand up there and ""press play."" (gratuitous use of quotation marks, I know -- just wanted to let you know those were direct quotes) ...which is completely untrue, considering I'm not using sync, and picking tracks that the party might actually want to hear instead of just playing everything off of a super sweet pre-set playlist.

My argument was that I wanted to give the party a beat to dance to; I wasn't sitting in my basement experimenting with what I could get away with, but in my opinion, they're kinda like frosting on cake -- too much just utterly fucking ruins it.

He was very upset with this notion, as people has started dancing, and he had been ""playing to an empty dance floor all day."" I guess I wanted to watch him go down in flames, so I let him on, and everyone cleared off again. He was furious, and made a big show of taking all of his gear and leaving, without bothering to stay and help take down any of the sound equipment that he had been using that day.

And look, but as soon as you start preaching to someone else about how what you do or think is better, that's when conflicts are gonna arise. The evidence was there. How can you not notice that your style sends people running?

**Chill-Ass Bride**: You hear a ton of stories about Bridezilla. Unless you do something additional to piss her off the bride she is chill as a cucumber. She was a Bridezilla last week so she could be chill today.

**Lost Groom**: This cat doesn't know what the fuck is going on and is just going through the motions. Give him a good time.

**The Best Friends**: These people know the bride and groom better than anybody

**Fail-Parents**: Speech goes like this

**Cool Parents**: Give a sick speech with hilarious stories

**Slutty Bridesmaid**: Drunk level: immediate

**Hot but Classy Bridesmaid**: Takes care of Slutmaid

**40 year old women who want to be twenty**: Will request old hip-hop/disco/classic rock

**Former DJ**: ""I Dj'ed for 5 years in the 80s

**Drunk BFF**: Thinks he's your fucking brother. Play one of his requests and he will buy you a drink.

**Random Hotties**: Black dresses

**The Couple**: Two things will happen. Either they will tear up the floor when you throw down a slow song (they took ballroom lessons and this is their only chance to show off)

**Old People**: (About Lady Gaga) TURN THIS RAP MUSIC DOWN!

My Personal Favourite:

**Good Guy Wedding Attendee**: Probably friends with groom but not overtly close. He gets what you are doing and appreciates it. Play his requests often

here's the story:

Three years ago this night club opened up in my town (Eugene, bartenders were inexperienced. They would maybe have 20 people inside between 11-1 (peak hours). Anyways, I suggested to my friend that he convince the owner to let me share the night with him and that I could bring new flavor to the table since every DJ currently there as strictly house and electro and I had a vast knowledge of hip-hop, top-40 and more classic party jam type of stuff. I do a guest spot on Saturday and we had maybe 50 people in there between 11-1, I get asked to come back next week and try again. This time there were 70 people between 11-1 and this kept going for a few weeks until I was asked to be hired on as a permanent resident with my friend every Saturday. Everyone liked me and everything was going just fine. We got a flat rate of $150 each no matter the outcome of the night. Fast forward one year. We now have 400-500 people coming through the door every night, they had to bring on more bartenders, hire security, word of mouth was there was a DJ on Saturday's who played rap, Friday's are still dead because one of the owners DJ's that night and refused to play any top-40 or anything current or relevant even with electro and house, they are extremely hesitant but understand my logic. Months go by and they are still blowing me off about the raise

I helped make this business successful. I changed the image from a weird night club that only 20 weirdos would go to on a Saturday to the premier spot in my town. Everyone that knows me knows it, they got greedy when the money started rolling in and I got tanked.

I asked for 10% of bar and 25% of the door, how to read a crowd. All while he used my $4,000 set-up for three years that I solely invested in straight because he didn't own anything other than a lap-top.)

Now that I'm fired after building this business, make me feel special :-(

EDIT: to be clear this place is owned by two people and they have an unusual business arrangement. One guy used to own a restaurant and has always wanted to own a night club so he meets the other guy who is a small record shop owner and has only had one permanent residency in his life in which he got fired from many years ago and has always since then wanted to own his own club and do it his own way. The way it's set-up is the restaurant guy hires and trains bartenders and security and the record shop guy hires the dj's. restaurant guy get's his money from the bar sales and he pays the dj's since dj's get zero of the door there. record shop guy keeps door. i think i mentioned before, split in half is 260 each, nothing more since we have hit the cap every Saturday since they implemented the new pay system with tier levels. The business will be just over three years next month and I was told by one of the owners they will be completely out of debt any moment. Also,  I would like to add that about one and a half years ago they bought out this small business connecting to their bar and tore down the wall to build a lounge and put in pool tables, couches, arcade games and what not and to increase capacity of the space by 30 or something.",,,,

Show starts at 9, even though the room was advertised as the trance room. He's finishing out his set, and judging from the jumping, sweaty, smiling crowd, they're diggin this stuff. So do I blindly jump in with the trance that I prepared? Naw. I listen to my gut and throw [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aek0WXEfM80) track down. 

And I'm off! I start off with this sort of electrohouse

So what's the point of this post? I guess I just wanted to reiterate that it's good practice to be able to think on your toes. To move with the crowd. To give them what they need

1314139843.0,js8eq,5 Simple Steps to Becoming a Superstar DJ (Sarcasm),omers,48,10,37,"I posted this to another site a while back

------
**Step 1 : Choose a DJ Name**

This step is easy

**Final Product:** DJ 4ardvark

**Pro-Tip:** To make it even more epic use ""DeeJay"" instead.

------
**Step 2 : Decide what you want to play**

Chose at least 8 genres right off the bat because mastery of one or two takes too long. Besides, Dub Step, Speed Garage, Nu-NRG, Breaks, Rotterdam, and Goa.""

**Pro-Tip:** Learn how to drop random tracks from one genre into another because cohesion isn't exciting. You can accomplish this by mashing the breakdown from a house track into the intro of a dubstep (don't worry about beatmatching

**Pro-Tip:** The more pretentious your music selection the better

------
**Step 3 : Actually get the music**

Remember that with the advent of the internet paying for music is no longer necessary. Grab yourself a copy of Limewire or Bearshare and go to town. 

Don't worry about the rumours you've heard; 128Kbps sounds awesome on huge sound systems. 320Kbps is just going to take up precious room on your hard drive that you'll need for you're eight genres from Step 2.

**Pro-Tip:** 96Kbps will save even more hard drive space.

------
**Step 4 : Pirate a copy of Virtual DJ**

Atomix

Virtual DJ is awesome because we get to skip a whole bunch of steps like ""Learn to Beatmatch"" thanks to things like the Sync button. Serato and Traktor are looked down upon in the vast majority of DJ circles for being too stable

**Pro-Tip:** When you post your mixes to Youtube use a static image of a set of turntables. You don't want people to know what awesome software you're using

------
**Step 5 : Make your presence known around town**

- Go to clubs and parties in your area. 
- Wait until the DJ that is spinning has his headphones on (this is a sign that he's ready to talk).
- Tap him on the shoulder and wait for him to give you the ""thank you for taking my mind of this mix"" glare of appreciation.
- Tell him ""Hey man
- Wait for the praise and acceptance that is due to you.

**Pro-Tip:** Tell him how the CDJs he's using are a nice piece of kit but you prefer the older model because the newer models are too fancy and take away from real DJing or go on at length about why Pioneer is over rated and clubs should switch to Behringer and Numark. 

------
**Steps you may have heard elsewhere that are actually not necessary:**

- **Practising**: You're awesome

- **Learning to Beatmatch**: That's what the sync button is for. Those DJs at the club who beatmatch don't have enough time to do lines of coke off the shooter girl

- **Learning to Phrase**: The faster you can bung tracks together the more tracks you can play. Peaks and valleys are boring - the music should be banging all night. NO BREAKDOWNS!

------
**Bonus Tips:** 

- If you want your Youtube videos to be popular make sure you have a strobe light

- All good DJ's change their name on Facebook to say ""&lt;Firstname&gt; DJWhatever &lt;Lastname&gt;"" because everyone you interact with needs to know you're a DJ and getting people to join a separate page actually dedicated to your DJ work takes too much effort.

- The more items clothing you have with logos like ""Technics"" and ""Rane"" on them the better.

- Always introduce yourself as ""DJ &lt;whatever&gt;

- **When in doubt: JESUS POSE!**

------

Once you have completed these steps gigs and girls will fall in to your lap with no effort at all!

Party on you awesome DJ you.

1308713720.0,i5vmf,How *not* to get a DJing gig.,noobprodigy,44,4,13,"So I live in a small city and just started throwing events. I finished school

So this guy approaches me, and I have been here for 6 years. He had told me on facebook earlier that he was bringing vinyl just in case. I told him I'd be willing to give him an opening slot down the road, but my next couple events are booked up. So at the party he pretty much tells me that he has been playing opening sets in town for years and he is sick of it. He wants a better slot. So he pretty much berates me to give him a better slot, asking what he has to do to get a better slot. I asked for a demo. He said he doesn't do demos, he does live auditions. Ok.... I asked him what his preferred format is, turntables, CDJs, what. He won't give me a straight answer

So, in reference to the party, he said to our mutual friend who had to miss it ""Didn't miss much, that's for sure"".

So, just fucking go along with whatever the promoter wants from you to get your foot in the door. Don't be confrontational, acting like you deserve it. Most of us have plenty of DJs to choose from, and it won't take much to get put on the ""do not book"" list.

1362234394.0,19itoz,Share your top tips,Santero,45,10,90,"This is a nice little community we've got built up in here now

I'll start with a few.

1.) The magic formulas. If I'm mixing house, and track B is 128 bpm, then they are 1.6% different. 1bpm = 0.8% pitch change in that situation. 126bpm mixing into 130? It needs to be +3.2%.

For dubstep/trap/140 its 0.7% per bpm, and so on. Its a really useful timesaver to be aware of this, even if on vinyl (where obviously its not as accurate because of the drift with technics). I now almost instinctively know what pitch to set a track at as I'm cueing up, at any tempo, before I've even listened through the headphones, so long as I know the bpm of what is currently playing.

2.) EQing when mixing tracks with vocals. Often if I'm mixing out of a vocal track into an instrumental track, as thats where the meat of the vocal resides. Do this well with tracks that complement each other and you can seamlessly blend vocals into the next track for an extended mix that can almost sound like a studio mashup.

3.) BE PREPARED. There's a reason the scouts had this motto. In my bag I have spare cables that I've never used, and be ready to deal with it when it happens, because eventually it probably will, and you will be the hero of the hour!

A big part of what causes world class DJs come to places like this over the competition is because they get treated *like fucking gold*.

At every other club I've spun at, sometimes broken, and if something breaks it's my responsibility to make the night work out despite that.

At Stereo, a guy on hand at all times to manage cables and other issues and help out when it came time to change over to the next DJ, and to round it all out, another guy waited until I was in a comfortable spot for a quick chat and asked me ""hey man, let me know what you want to drink and i'll make sure you're stocked up"".

The search almost failed, 'cause after months of looking, pretty much everybody had given up on ever finding it, untill last week when one of the group members victoriously posted a soundcloud link to the actual song. It probably was one of the coolest moments in the groups existence, as you could just feel the euphoria of everyone being finally able to hear the track on it's own. 

The tune turned out to be 'Change' by berlin based artists Mille &amp; Mr. Hirsch. A duo unknown to us before we heard 'Change' but one we'll be keeping an eye on from now. Their label ApolloKrieg is based on an art collective from Berlin

When I was in high school I mowed lawns and worked an after school job to fund my gear purchases. I saved for months to buy the cheapest direct drive turntable setup I could get my hands on. Numarks and a Vestax mixer. I thought I'd made it. Soon thousands would jump in unison to the rhythms that flowed through my fingertips. I ran them through a big bass amp -- with TUBES in it

And I practiced.

And I practiced...

I had two vinyl copies of [Boogie Shoes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ux2WXNsqfe8) by K.C. and the Sunshine Band and I would loop them together, a morass of useless information with no [freshnewtracks.com](http://www.freshnewtracks.com) or [beatport.com](http://www.beatport.com) or even /r/djs -- and I'd mail order vinyl or scour the one store in my shitty deep south town that sold what I was looking for. I remember spending $8 or $10 for a single song. I'd put stickers on my records with the BPM and the key (after I'd figured it out by learning the chord progression on my guitar). To record a mix I'd have to borrow a friend's 4 channel multi-track recorder. It recorded to a cassette tape. I'd plug it in, hit record, do my mix and then record that cassette into my family's desktop so I could burn a CD. I played house parties, school events, that sort of thing but the thousands that I had pictured never jumped in unison. 

And then I graduated and went to college. I moved into a tiny dorm room where my setup wouldn't fit and I didn't touch my decks for years. They collected dust. One weekend when I was back from school visiting my family I gave them to a friend's younger brother when I heard he'd been pricing some. I figured it was better that he used them than I held onto them. And the dream died.

Fast forward ten years. 

Last week a business associate sent me [this video of Deadmau5](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SX2Gd-kqV5s) and the memories flooded back. I found this subreddit

Today I went out and picked up a Numark Mixtrack Pro and recorded the [first mix I've attempted in over a decade](http://www.mixcloud.com/ProfessorMembrane/prowess/). It's solid

* **Record a demo** - I'd advise any new DJ wanting to get booked to record a demo mix to hand out on a cd with your details on or send people online. 

* **Make a page for yourself** - Make a page where you can share your mixes. I know some people may feel its too soon to make a fan page and there are a lot of them around. If this is the case for you

* **Network** - I've found this is one of the more important sides to getting yourself known. Sending a demo is sometimes not enough but get out there to events you're interested in playing at. Greet the promoter

* **Radio shows** - If you don't feel confident enough to have your own yet then find some friends who run one. Guest appearances on local or internet radio can help out a lot. I got one of my biggest gigs from playing on a smallish online radio station and a promoter enjoying what I played. You never know who is listening.. 

* **Don't give up** - If you love it

I don't take anything due to my asthma, either going from a good night to a great night, or from a good night to an awful night.  I've gotten a lot of hugs from random strangers, but I've also been swung at because I had ""a look"" about me.  

You could still smoke in clubs which helped to calm people down and would actually negate the need for a smoke machine, have a couple of smokes outside and return, which was very annoying when the hot girls went out, the dancefloor would stop because no one wants to dance next to a sweaty ugly girl, so everyone would go to the bar til the hot girls came back!

People taking coke in the toilets, it just seems to rise and rise, and some folk become VERY talkative, I could be in the middle of a mix and some dick just can't get it into his head that I'm busy for the next 30 seconds, and all he wanted to tell me was that he's going out for a minute, can I hold his coat, lmao!

I've seen ketamine just kill a dance floor, some even sit down where they can, and the aforementioned bouncing club is now like a post wedding disco when both sides of the family hate each other!

And decks don't have shit for effects (at least not the ones in my price range) like software does. 

I've also just considered using a Kontrol X1 along with decks so I can still use Traktor and not be a ""tool"" in the eyes of my peers. Anyone else do something like this?

So now he's moved away, had him do visuals, etc. Now of course everyone here thinks he's a scumbag. I think he will find that moving to a bigger city means that it will be harder to get booked, not easier.

Tonight was my first frat party. The first hour or so, the girls hated me. It didn't stop them from constantly touching my shit, but they hated my guts. This is what caused all the trouble. I figured ""Oh, sorority girls. Top 40 time."" I'd been practicing mixing and mashing and transitions for weeks, preparing for this moment and two songs in I get bitched at by one of them. She wants house music, so I put on some house music which she then bitches about. Then more girls start bitching about how they want different house music. Then the other girls want the Top 40 back. This then pisses the other girls off and so on and so forth. This continued for HOURS. I was told by one of the brothers to just tell them to fuck off, but I'm too nice of a guy to do that. I tried explaining to them,"" that there are dozens of people making requests and that I'd get to theirs as soon as I could

So overall, tough luck. Next time I get a gig I'm setting up some kind of barricade to keep sorority sluts from blitzing the booth with requests; folding chairs, tables, idk I'll figure something out. This night has made me lose a lot of faith in humanity... but I can't let that slow me down. I still wanna keep going. Things are taking off for me and I can't let one night stop that.

TL;DR: Among other things

**EDIT:** Thanks for the support guys. The fact that what happened tonight was normal makes me feel much better about it.

DJing is expensive.  My equipment costs a lot of money. I have at least $20k worth of DJ equipment and music.  I need a vehicle to cart it around it.  I need insurance to cover it all.  I need a website to attract business.  I need to advertise.  I need to buy music. I need to spend TIME getting that music.  In short


I know when you are first starting out, why would you give it away?  Chances are you're doing a lot of promotion to bring people to see you.  You're maybe even providing sound equipment, and lets not forget about your time and talent.  These are all worth money.

There's no such thing as a sell out.  I used to think that DJ's that started in the underground who ended up making it big with a commercial track were ""selling out"".  I don't think making money is selling out. Actually

People will actually take you more seriously if you ask them for money.  If you aren't charging anything, and quoted the price to a prospective client and they were happy to pay it.  Just make sure you deliver what you promise!  

I DJ full time, and listening to whatever the hell I want, from Pleasurehead to Pantera. I can get up whenever I want from my computer and play with my animal friends, or take a break and rip it on the Xbox or go golfing.   Not really bragging as much as I am saying ""Charge them bastards!""

Also, and whomever brought the most people on their competition night got to actually PLAY.  The other DJ's didn't get to play at all.  It was total and complete bullshit, yet, DJ's were lining up around the block to sign up.  The prize was 4 ""paid"" timeslots.  Are you kidding me?  If you see one of these scams, STOP GOING TO THAT VENUE ALTOGETHER.

**EDIT** If it's a legit contest


I'm not saying ""DJ gigs you will hate"".  Personally, and I always gotta worry if I am playing something that might offend one of their parents.   I prefer playing for a crowd that appreciates real EDM (house, trance, electro) or adults...but I can DO it if I need to... for $600.00/4 hrs.

I've commented in the past about doing top40 gigs

If you're already a hobby DJ spinning dance music, meaning I did all the dumb shit I tell you not to do. (By the way, this advice is for beginning nightclub DJs-- weddings are a whole other story.)

**You learn how to contact clubs.**
To get a gig

Forget about email-- it's only for confirming details AFTER you've spoken with or met someone.

You want to either call directly on the phone, or in charge of music and DJs. Shake their hand and sell yourself to them. Be forward! Tell them you're a DJ, what kind of music you play, and where you've spun before. You're saying to their face (in not so many words)-- ""I want to DJ at your club. What are you going to do about it?"" 

You want to ask first ""Are you looking for DJs?"", and which ones you'll have to work to get people out to.

Unless you're a wedding DJ, shake hands, and write it out in an email afterwords to make sure everything is clear. If a promoter promises $100, and doesn't pay up, just move on and never work with them again.

**Practice.**
All DJing is good practice. With top40 you'll be beatmatching, you may be doing 4-bar mixes instead of 64. 

You'll learn how songs from different styles and eras relate to each other in ways the crowd never imagined, or when you should clear the floor and start fresh.

You'll figure out your best hardware/software setup and how to streamline the way you spin. And more practically

**You learn how to get music and how music promo works.**
You find it's a lot harder to get pop music than you think. How do I get these radio edits? Do I buy them individually from iTunes? How do I get these promo-only dance remixes? It used to be so easy to torrent the Beatport top100! Help!

Likely you'll have to join a digital record pool

Plus you'll build a music library of popular songs for those key moments when someone asks you to do an impromptu 80s cheese or 90s euro set. Unlike throwaway dance music tools of now

And finally if you're a real DJ, accessible music you can insert in your sets that shows your unique style and taste.

**And finally.... MONEY!**
Unlike the electro house night you tried to throw, who buy alcohol, so that means the club pays you money! A top40 DJ will never run out of work. 

Except in special circumstances, you may get drink tickets! Remember to tip.

There is so much more involved to this than what I've listed here, grind it out. At the end you'll be richer and a better DJ.",,False,,t5_2rddy,False,,

What are some of the things you wish you had done differently?

Some of mine:


*DJ Name:  I split my DJ time between underground gigs or festivals - where I'm building up a decent little following dj and production-wise - and mainstream top 40/corporate/mobile gigs which I do for the money (I consider the mainstream work my day job right now).   I really wish I had decided to use a different name for my mainstream gigs as I tend to get pigeon-holed a little (at least locally) in terms of my style.  I'm in the unfortunate position of sometimes losing out on underground gigs (the ones I love) due to having a reputation of playing mainstream shows around town.


*Production:  I started getting into production maybe 5 years ago and had my first tune signed about 3 years ago.  I'm still having trouble getting myself to really push at it cause honestly


*Mic work:  Yea, throwing down too many cliche's, or just plain annoying.  That said, a good MC can really add to a live set even if it's just doing hype work.  Being good at MCing during your sets can really hype a crowd when done well, but more importantly, really helps build your brand.  You're letting the crowd know who you are (hopefully not to the point of annoyance), and that goes a long way in maintaining your name and brand and most importantly: building fans.  I only started getting on the mic in the last couple of years or so and it really is a skill you have to work at... granted a couple drinks doesn't hurt...


*Pro-activeness:  There was a time when I was getting a ton of bookings based mainly on reputation.  It was great having people constantly hitting you up for gigs.  Granted this was also when I was working a day job so I could pick and choose gigs as I wanted.  After a while, I just didn't bother trying to pursue it again cause it was just so demoralizing hearing ""not interested"" or worse, just getting no responses.  I'm much more aggressive in pursuing bookings now and I'm much less phased by rejection.  Think of it like asking someone out.  You may get rejected or ignored 9/10 times, but you'll never get that yes if you don't keep asking...

Here is how things usually go:

1 active drive: your collection is already gone

n active drives: a power problem could kill them all

n active

n active, theft, human error, sabotage, building fire/disaster, zombie apocalypse, and you should still be fine

To be safe this is what you should do:

Step1: build your music collection

Step2: copy your collection onto as many different devices and formats as necessary (disc, cloud, tape)

Step3: Verify your backups on multiple machines

Step4: Distribute your physical backups to various locations (home, parents, bank, storage) this is less practiced but you put all your efforts at risk in the event of a serious accident/disaster.

Step5: Update and re-verify your backups regularly.

Step6: Laugh when you suffer a drive failure because its pretty much impossible to lose information at this point

My PC contains my master copy on 2 internal drives, 1 of which sits in my basement. I used the second external to duplicate my collection onto my macbook and my girlfriends computer as well. And all of that doesn't count the multiple flash drive copies I use in my CDJs for day to day playback.

that's between 6 and 10 copies at ay given time and I would consider that pretty close to the minimum I'm comfortable with. It's a pain to keep them all organized but that's a better problem than trying to recover lost data

Reasons: I played violin for eight years of my life, if you're a beginner, you just don't know what you want. Here's my favorite example of just go with it and learn, as told by a tale of three basses.

~

1.) When I was first getting into bass playing, cheap, with a lame ""police line, do not cross"" strap and a matching red cord.

This is most people's initial instinct when buying something, and I thought that bass would be perfect for my little alt. rock band my buddy started.

This bass was perfect for my needs at the time, not a pick, and this bass was more pick inclined.

I preferred booming low end bass and the pick ups here weren't very good

~

2.) My second bass I bought from a friend of a friend for what I'm pretty sure was an attempt for drug money. It was a black bass, and had an active drive. The bass was amazing and I thought I had landed on my dream bass guitar.

It wasn't flashy, and as my skills improved and my tone became more important, my low end mattered less and an overall good sound was more important.

That and I realized I didn't like the look of my bass

~

3.) Bass 3, something that I liked the look of, and a bass that had a clean, but solid low end. I found it, I bought it, and loved the bass every gig after that.

~

Beginners: buy something you like, cdjs, controller, brand, software/no software you want. Just get something inexpensive, make sure you like spinning and can enjoy it and have fun learning what your style is and as you learn you'll start realizing what products best fit it.

This is something you wade into, sit at your computer with headphones on and just see what you like. If you love it, great, if you don't? friend or pawn shop. Don't overspend and don't freak out about it, just get SOMETHING and learn by doing. That's the best way to figure out what music you like and what to get to facilitate that the best.

tl;dr just buy something cheap

~


Edit: Just to be clear, I was practicing so I wouldn't embarrass myself whenever I upgraded, and eventually did. 

Even when I upgraded though I couldn't afford CDJs. If I could afford them I would buy them

Here's where it got weird: About 10:30 this older guy ( early 60’s) comes up and says "" hey I'm a sound engineer
I play a Fleetwood mac remix, I thought you were going to play some older stuff, this crowd doesn't like your music...""   I tell him that I did play some remixed versions of 70's and 80's tracks and that all I have is dance music.  He grumbles a little and I tell him that if he doesn't like the genre the owners booked, he should take it up with them as they're sitting at the bar but that I have no music that isn't dance music.
Another 30 minutes goes by and he comes back.  This time he's fairly irate.  He waited till my wife was in the bathroom and comes up and tells me “I don't think you understand what's happening here.  This used to be a biker bar and no one here wants your shitty music.  Does it look like anyone is enjoying your music? “I reiterate that if he has a problem with the booking that he should take it up with the owner

Had an interesting experience last night and kind of just wanted to share in case anyone with a lil less experience finds themselves in a similar situation. Those of you who are already familiar with promoters BS and ways to deal with it can probably relate or add something. 

My partner and I were asked by a reputable local hip hop producer to play at his NYE kegger in a loft space converted from an old schoolhouse. Sounds pretty cool right? Long story short, jus sayin) and help promote it, that's always ground for at LEAST a small guestlist. I don't care what they spent on kegs or flyers or sounds, if you want us to show up with our thousands of dollars worth of equipment and play an hour for free, you're gonna have to give a little up.

The last straw though was when this promoter/producer/dj guy's manager (aka his DAD) told us the two lovely young ladies accompanying us who arrived with us, would have to each pay the $20 cover charge. It was at that point I politely told the old man we would not be performing that night. He (laughably) tried to justify the expense but hearing the bullshit that was being flung from his mouth was too much and we immediately booked it outta there. Lucky for us it was NYE eve and parties were going on everywhere, and within 5 mins of announcing via twitter we weren't performing, we had an invitation to play a house party. 

The night turned out great, there will be tons of situations where you're not happy with the conditions of the party.  Some times its important to grit your teeth and bear it.  A lot of what we do as Djs is based on the connections and relationships we can make. In the beginning it can be more difficult to judge what's worth it. This producer is certainly well known with a decent demographic in our city, and considering our new dj/production duo is only about 4 months old, the potential to showcase our music to the right people was there.  Lucky for us our previous projects and years of hitting the pavement and making connections puts us in a comfortable enough position to say, 'Lol fuck that' and not have to worry about did we burn an important bridge. 

So for all of you talented bedroom djs ready to take the next step and go public, just make sure you're in touch with the difference between paying dues and shitty people. There's certainly a grey area, and I normally err on the side of caution because typically even a shitty show that you don't get payed for and no one shows up to is still an hour of practice and some potential networking. But lol if you think I'm paying for my girl to get into a party I'm spinning. Don't be afraid to tell these promoters to go fuck themselves, they're a dime a dozen no matter what their hype says.

I'm an open-format producer turned DJ and have been DJing (Serato + Turntables) in clubs/bars for about four years now.

So, DJs of Reddit, how would YOU guys like to get these? I'm debating a mailing list, or setting up my own (free) ""mini"" record pool on a website, but would love any input. Thanks!

**Live Streaming Event Nov 28th**

In that year we have become a regular community of music loving, we'd like to put on a streaming event. I've been talking about this in the channel for some time now, and many of us are interested. Since most of us are in different time zones, so timing will be tricky, but I'm sure we can figure something out. If you're interested in meeting the IRC /r/djs crazies, please stop by with either [The Freenode Webchat](http://webchat.freenode.net/) or your favorite IRC client. You will need to specify the #r_djs room and a nickname if connecting with the web chat. I would like to get a live streaming event on or around Nov 28th, 2012. You can download an IRC client for your OS here:

* [Hexchat Windows IRC Client](http://www.hexchat.org/home/downloads)
* [Colloquy Mac OSX Client](http://colloquy.info/downloads.html)
* If you're using Linux

In Hexchat, but I wouldn't know. 

We have built a really wonderful community of producers, if you're unfamiliar with how it works, you can check out a short [IRC Primer](http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/ircprimer.html) on IRChelp.org. There are many commands to learn, but all you really need to do is chat. If upon joining the chat room, you don't immediately get a response, please stick around and idle for a while, someone will greet you. 

We're looking forward to another amazing year!

Another particular thing about him is how he has this horrible habit of  being a compulsive liar about EVERYTHING HE SAYS.  He swears up and down he's co produced with Benny Benassi and even opened for him (when there is no evidence)  - he even slept with a local radio rep and when they were done threatened to slander the radio rep if he didn't have his sets played during rush hour (he doesn't realize radio stations don't really often chose what they play).

**Vinyls**

The words ""vinyls"" does not exist. The plural of vinyl is vinyl or ""vinyl records"". 

- Bob has a large vinyl collection.
- Bob plays vinyl.
- Bob is going to the store to grab some vinyl.
- Bob plays vinyl on his turntables.
- Bob has one vinyl record.
- Bob has ten vinyl records.
- Bob got some new vinyl.

**Platter** - When talking about CDJs or controllers.

CDJs and controllers do not have platters

- The platter on a turntable usually spins at 33 RPM.
- You use the jog wheel on a CDJ to pitch bend or scratch.

**Electro vs electro**

Usually when people say electro these days what they mean is Electro House which is confusing for old fogies like myself because Electro is actually its own genre originally called ""Electro Funk"". If you're talking Electro House and shortening it to electro do not capitalize the e.

**Techno**

This is nothing new

Techno like House also has sub-genres; Minimal, Acid, and so on. It's best when dealing with other DJs not to use Techno as a descriptor for electronic music lest you confuse someone who thinks you're talking about the genre.

Last night, and neither of us have that much equipment, but I digress.  He went to our party with a predetermined setlist of electrohouse and dubstep.  The crowd wasn't into it at all, but he didn't adapt to this, and just played out his setlist straight.

I played a warmup set and got up to some midtempo hip hop at 90 bpm before switching off to him with a full room of people tapping toes and grooving to the chill beat.  His first song was an electrohouse (the kind with a huge drop bro) remix of Thriller

He stuck to his premade setlist even though it was literally just him alone in the room DJing while everyone else was sitting outside, but he followed that with Bass Cannon so everyone left again.  Eventually, with an hour before the host planned to kick us out, he gave music control back to me.

I didn't play music for half an hour to coax people back inside (they were all cold be then and readily came back in now that the music was off).  I started creeping in music, though, everyone was leaving.

I feel that his rigid set severely detracted from the night.  It was a costume party and he had several opportunities to play popular music highlighting various costumes (Beatlejuice, which he didn't see as a sign to change up his music.

**Necessary reading**

I realize I'm just bitching at this point

The point of this overly ranty post is that I really want to help him, and remind him that he is playing music for the party, not himself.  What's a good way to do this?

See title of post.

I figured this would help a bunch of you out. So without further ado, secured, and synchronized.

You don't have to follow all these steps or use the same exact setup as I do. You can customize your library in whatever way you like. This is aimed more towards showing you step-by-step how to use a few powerful library management tools. 

I might not cover everything in great detail

Apparently, so I split up this post into sections in the comments. If you have any questions regarding a step in a certain section, PLEASE reply to the comment for the section in question.

You don’t have to perform these steps if you don’t feel it’s necessary or you already have a good enough solution. I divided up this post into sections so you could skip through them. However


****

**PREREQUISITES**

****

**Platform**

- Windows 7 *(Any version)*
- Traktor Pro *(Any version)*


**Tools Used in this Tutorial**

- [SyncToy 2.1](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15155) *(Free)*
- [MediaMonkey 4.0.3 Gold](http://www.mediamonkey.com/download/) *(Free / $24.99 for Gold. There are a few features here that require the Gold version. You don't really need it too badly, I recommend it)*
* [MP3tag 2.51](http://www.mp3tag.de/en/download.html) *(Free)*

**Hardware Required**

* A Backup Location *(Preferably external)*

* *(Optional)* A network Connection between the two PCs you're synchronizing

****
**What I use:**


* A laptop running Traktor Pro 2.5
* A desktop running traktor Pro 2.5
* An external drive
* 1 x Traktor Kontrol X1, 1 x Audio 8 DJ
* A wired gigabit network
* Both My desktop and Laptop use the same library and back up to the same location
* My Desktop runs a scheduled backup of my library every night at 4:00am
* Both Machines have the same drivers for the devices I use to perform


****

**OVERVIEW**

****

* Again
This should be present on both machines. Same drive letters and everything. Both of my machines have an S:\ Drive on them and they both have identical the same contents in the music directory. 

The reason why I’m having you use a different drive letter is to keep your music and your Traktor files separate from the same partition as your operating system. There are so many reasons as to why this is a good idea. We’ll also tell your user folder’s location to point to this new drive.  It makes things like backing up

So, that were significant moments in your DJ careers. Let it all out, pour your hearts out like a college freshman pours out the last of the beer keg.

I've been deejaying a year now after I went to my first rave and thought to myself ""I wanna be THAT guy on stage!""; And being the lucky bastard I am,electro,moombahton,etc. But he wanted me to be a top 40 dj like him, and would destroy my self esteem on my mixes.but he let me use his equipment so I always just agreed with him and promised to do better and play more top 40.the original set up was a denon mc6000 with virtual dj (yes I abused the sync button...) i learned some basics like what songs sound good together, effects, basic mixing,another controller) i was thrilled because the little fanboy in me screamed ""omg pioneer!!!"". But around the same time I started deejaying with my cousin(a long time house/electro dj) he has a set of cdj900 and a djm700 pioneer setup.This scared the shit out of me... no laptop, i was at my cousins house having a party and a few of my cousins dj friends came by. We ended up bringing the decks outside and playing for everyone (family &amp;friends). I nervouslytook hold of the controls (I had only played in a closed bedroom or garage with no more than 2 people around) and played for 45 min solid no laptop

I guess I'm just bragging and being a stupid kid(I'm 19) but I'm really proud of myself for coming this far and done as well as I have.this is going to get downvoted and destroyed but I just wanted to thank r/djs for helping me here and there with questions I had and to tell everyone my experience as a real dj now.
