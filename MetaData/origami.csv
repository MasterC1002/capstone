EDIT 08/26/12: They are pouring in! We are going to crush the goal of 1000! My sincerest thank you... Your outpouring has been monumental and has done more good that you will know. I'll update soon with a final count.

EDIT 08/30/12: We are approaching 3000! Reddit

EDIT 09/07/12: 5000. Incredible!

My sister-in-law is dying from a genetic disorder called [Mitochondrial Disease](http://www.umdf.org/site/c.8qKOJ0MvF7LUG/b.7929671/k.BDF0/Home.htm). She is rapidly running out of time...

One of the items on Leslie's Bucket list is to fold 1000 paper cranes. According to Japanese legend, or three, or four!) in her honor. 

If you would like to participate, and write/stick/draw/glue some inspirational words, encouragement, positive thoughts, wishes of your own, etc., onto the crane! Get them to me by 08/29/12 and I will string them together for her. Pictures/video of yourself in the process or with the finished product will also be appreciated. 

Here's [how to fold](http://www.origami-fun.com/origami-crane.html) if you are new at this (which I can't imagine in this subreddit).

I am extremely new to origami; I decided I wanted to learn it yesterday since I found an old Origami book in my drawer.

Do you guys have any idea where a beginner like me could start? Maybe a website or something which does step-by-step instructions so that I learn?

Hope this is the right place to post! Thanks in advance!
