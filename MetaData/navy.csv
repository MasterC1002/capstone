Your first step will be finding a Navy [recruiter](http://www.navycs.com/districts.html). Like any other military applicant you will have to take the [ASVAB](http://www.navycs.com/asvab-test.html). If you score well enough on this test you will be given the option to become a nuke. If you do not qualify from baseline scores you may take another exam, and electrical. 


*What if I have I have some problems with my past?*

You will have to speak to your 

*Who is the best fit for the program?*

Single young adults (18-24) with some interest in [STEM fields](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM_fields) and not afraid of hard work and long hours.  

If you are coming out of high school, and have no money for school. 

It’s also really awesome if you dropped out of college…you probably have a lot of debt and little job skills. The Navy will force study habits on you and help with your student debt.

If you have finished college

If you are in any sort of non-married relationship, and when you get to your sea command it’s even less time. Married Navy life is extremely difficult; give a lot of thought to the hardships you will experience with your spouse. 

If you are a female you may a harder time than your male counterparts – there are very few females, that’s slowly changing). 


*Why should I become a nuke?*

Money! Nukes are the highest paid enlisted service members (or close to it). You will have the highest enlistment bonus (last I heard around $12, but I think it’s around $100k now), make rank faster (which is more money), and get a special nuke pay.

Along with the pay

If you want to become an officer

 
*Why shouldn’t I become a nuke?*

Well
Nukes also have the least flexibility – you won’t be eligible for SEALS or other special programs. You won’t be able to cross rate.  Nukes also have the most limited opportunities for shore duty. Also


*Can I finish college while I’m in?*

Maybe, and even fewer of those are accredited (you will want ABET accreditation). You won’t be able to take any classes while you are in nuclear power school, and it’s a crap shoot on how receptive your sea command is to it (mine wasn’t at all). You will have a better chance if you go aircraft carriers.

Again

The post 9/11 GI Bill is available when you get out


*What rate should I be?*

Unlike just about every other rate in the Navy, and Electronic Technician (ET). 

MMs obviously work with the mechanical equipment (pipes, but the ETs work is more politically sensitive and requires a ton of paperwork.

Like getting your hands dirty? Pick MM or EM

Like paperwork? Pick ET.

MMs also get a chance to be an Engineering Laboratory Technician (ELT) later on. They primarily work with water chemistry and radiation/contamination (RADCON). Their job is also politically sensitive so they have a lot of paperwork as well. 

From a working hours perspective, and ETs/ELTs work the least all the time.  

Most applicants pick ET due to the attractiveness of a longer school but they are also the least manned of the 3 rates


*Is the job safe?*

Well
From a radiation perspective

From a military perspective – who knows? Remember you are on a ship of war and may be called on to fight at any time. I don’t have a crystal ball to know will happen

From an industrial environment perspective


*What is boot camp like?*

Sucks.  I found it boring and tedious but mileage varies. Just get through it and don’t take anything personally.  You’ll hear a lot of stories about Nukes too – none of them are true.

I’m hitting my 3 years out of the Navy point and I thought I would celebrate by contributing to the enlisted nuclear community. I’m going to run down the questions my pre-Navy high school self would (and should) have asked. Please note that while most of info is up to date

About me: I was a Nuclear Machinist’s Mate (MM1) for ~9 ½ years.  I joined the Navy out of high school. I found high school pretty easy


*How do I become a nuke?*

Like any other military applicant you will have to take the ASVAB. If you score well enough on this test (around 80th percentile I believe) you will be given the option to take another exam to determine your eligibility for the nuclear program.  The test is mostly math, but I believe it’s still similar.


*Who is the best fit for the program?*

Single young adults (18-24) with some interest in STEM fields and not afraid of hard work and long hours.  

If you are coming out of high school, not really sure what to do, and no money for school. 

It’s also really awesome if you dropped out of college…you probably have a lot of debt and little job skills. The Navy will force study habits on you and help with your student debt.

If you have finished college

If you are in any sort of non-married relationship, and when you get to your sea command it’s even less time.  Married Navy life is extremely difficult and I would never recommend it. 

It's my opinion that females will have a harder time than there male counterparts – there are very few females, that’s slowly changing). 


*Why should I become a nuke?*

Money! Nukes are the highest paid enlisted service members (or close to it). You will have the highest enlistment bonus (last I heard around $45, but I think it’s around $100k now), make rank faster (which is more money), and get a special nuke pay.

Along with the pay

If you want to become an officer

 
*Why shouldn’t I become a nuke?*

Well
Nukes also have the least flexibility – you won’t be eligible for SEALS or other special programs. You won’t be able to cross rate.  Nukes also have the most limited opportunities for shore duty. 


*Can I finish college while I’m in?*

Maybe, and even fewer of those are accredited (you will want ABET accreditation). You won’t be able to take any classes while you are in nuclear power school, and it’s a crap shoot on how receptive your sea command is to it (mine wasn’t at all). You will have a better chance if you go aircraft carriers.

Again

The post 9/11 GI Bill is available when you get out


*What rate should I be?*

Unlike just about every other rate in the Navy, and Electronic Technician (ET). 

MMs obviously work with the mechanical equipment (pipes, but the ETs work is more politically sensitive and requires a ton of paperwork.

Like getting your hands dirty? Pick MM or EM

Most applicants pick ET due to the attractiveness of a longer school but they are also the least manned of the 3 rates


*Is the job safe?*

Well
From a radiation perspective

From a military perspective – who knows? Remember you are on a ship of war and may be called on to fight at any time. I don’t have a crystal ball to know will happen

From an industrial environment perspective


*What is boot camp like?*

Sucks.  I found it boring and tedious but mileage varies. Just get through it and don’t take anything personally.  You’ll hear a lot of stories about Nukes too – none of them are true. 


*Where to next?*

It’s off to Charleston, you’ll be close to being treated like an adult. You will be living in barracks if you are single (think of a dorm environment) and close base housing if married. 

The schools are a bit different than anywhere else – you will be given mandatory time which you have to study (meaning you have to physically come into the school house
Some protips: If you are less than 21 years old

For a lot of sailors this will be the first time making a real paycheck and having financial independence. Try to give yourself a budget and not live paycheck to paycheck. 

The Navy nuke schooling environment isn't very tolerant of the mixing of genders - stay out of the barracks from the opposite gender and don't even think of bringing a gf/bf back to your place.

Also remember as you go through the schooling part of your Navy Nuclear career


*What about “A” school?*

“A” school is where you learn your trade skill. I’m pretty mechanically declined so I found it a bit rough
I don’t know what the attrition rate is
 

*What about Power School?*

It’s a bit harder than “A” school, but that’s probably why you signed up to be a nuke so it’s fairly engaging.

First off

I'm also looking for any idea of what I can expect in terms of dealing with the Navy as a spouse. Obviously this is far more complicated than normal but any basics that may help with day to day life would be appreciated. I've checked out some of the related subs but found little help. I'm mostly thinking about things that may come up or may be good to plan for during a deployment. Husband is a sub officer so anything relevant to that such as dealing with the lack of communication would be of particular interest.

1375311455.0,1jgdr9,FeralTexan explains how to simulate life aboard a US Navy Warship in your house,FeralTexan,55,26,19,"HOW TO SIMULATE SHIPBOARD LIFE AT HOME

	When commencing this simulation, “You didn’t get anything.”

	Surround yourself with 500 to 6, snore like a Mack truck on an uphill grade, complain constantly, seldom shower or brush their teeth, and use expletives in speech the way children use sugar on cold cereal.

	Cut a twin mattress in half, have someone take your pillow and blanket (or both) to simulate that special camaraderie that exists only on US Navy ship.

	Remove all plants

	Prepare yourself for an emergency that will require you to evacuate the premises knowing that if you exit

	Unplug all radios and televisions to completely cut yourself off from the outside world. Have a neighbor bring you a time or a Newsweek magazine from 2 or 3 months ago.

	Monitor all operating home appliances hourly, etc). If not in use, log appliance as secured.

	Do not flush the toilet for the first three days to simulate the smell of 80 people using the same commode. After that, shampoo in hair) have your neighbor shut off all the water.

	Wear only approved coveralls or proper uniform (no special or cut-off T-shirts.) Even though nobody cares, on a broken ironing board (or a towel on the floor) and wear it for 20 minutes while standing at attention. After this, change back into coveralls, catch and rip the sleeve of your shirt on a sharp object on your way to change, curse and yell. Then wad it up and throw it in the locker.

	 Cut your hair weekly

	Work 18 hour cycles. Sleep ONLY four hours at a time to ensure your body doesn’t know or care if it is daytime or nighttime.

	Listen to your favorite cassette six times a day for two weeks. Then play music that causes acute nausea and tension headaches until you are glad to get back to your “favorite” cassette.

	Set your alarm clock to go off at the snooze interval for the first hour of sleep, police whistle, and a punk rock band combined, to simulate various drill alarms onboard the ship, and so you will get accustomed to ignoring your alarm clock.

	Prepare all food while blindfolded, to simulate shipboard food. Remove the blindfold and eat as fast as humanly possible. If the food does not stick to an inverted plate when cold, use more lard. If the food contains more than one part per thousand of fiber, dispose of it. Always take more than you can possibly eat, to keep up with the waste standards of the Navy.

	Buy a gas mask, every fifth day or less, even to the bathroom.

	Study the owner’s manual for all appliances in the house. At regular intervals, put it back together again. Test its operations to the extreme of its tolerance.

	Discard any rolls of toilet tissue that you have in your house. Take several sheets of thin cardboard and cut them into long strips, place them about the floor of your bathroom. This will be your toilet tissue.

	To make sure that you are living in a clean and happy environment, even if its only a three hour job, whenever, and as often as possible, repeating your efforts. Then have a friend or neighbor tell you that you missed some dust, and the floor looks like crap. When completed, have another friend inspect your work

	Every three weeks, wearing your best clothes. Enter the raunchiest bar you can find and ask the bartender for the most expensive imported beer he carries. Drink as many of these as fast as you possible can in four hours and then hire a cab to take you home by the longest route he can find. Tip the cab driver after he charges you double, because you were dressed funny, and lock yourself in your house for another three or twelve weeks.

	Run a blender on a constant  high speed

	Buy the loudest stereo that you can

	To achieve the permanent, throw the wet clothing in a dark corner for two days before drying. Go through your underwear drawer and discard every third sock. Take the remaining socks and cut holes at random in the toes and heels. Damage all elastic bands.

	This simulation must run for a minimum of three months to be effective. The exact date of the end of simulation will be changed no fewer than seven times without your knowledge. This is done to keep you guessing as to when you can expect to get back to a semi-normal life. It is also done in hope of screwing up the plans you have made, but do not go outside. Have your loved ones stand outside, across the street, while you stand at attention for four hours, just looking at them.

I like the sounds of the Navy – the piercing trill of the boatswains pipe

I like Navy vessels – nervous darting destroyers, Lexington, Saratoga, Coral Sea – memorials of great battles won. I like the lean, angular names of Navy ‘tin-cans’: Barney, Dahlgren, Mullinix, mementos of heroes who went before us.

I like the tempo of a Navy band blaring through the topside speakers as we pull away from the oiler after refueling at sea. I like liberty call and the spicy scent of a foreign port. I even like all hands working parties as my ship fills herself with the multitude of supplies both mundane and exotic which she needs to cut her ties to the land and carry out her mission anywhere on the globe where there is water to float her.

I like sailors, small towns of New England, from the cities, the mountains and the prairies, from all walks of life. I trust and depend on them as they trust and depend on me – for professional competence, for comradeship, for courage. In a word

I like the surge of adventure in my heart when the word is passed “Now station the special sea and anchor detail – all hands to quarters for leaving port”

The work is hard and dangerous, but the companionship of robust Navy laughter, the ‘all for one and one for all’ philosophy of the sea is ever present. I like the serenity of the sea after a day of hard ship’s work, as flying fish flit across the wave tops and sunset gives way to night.

I like the feel of the Navy in darkness – the masthead lights, and that my shipmates on watch will keep me safe. I like quiet midwatches with the aroma of strong coffee – the lifeblood of the Navy – permeating everywhere.

And I like hectic watches when the exacting minuet of haze-gray shapes racing at flank speed keeps all hands on a razor edge of alertness. I like the sudden electricity of “General quarters, followed by the hurried clamor of running feet on ladders and the resounding thump of watertight doors as the ship transforms herself in a few brief seconds from a peaceful workplace to a weapon of war – ready for anything.
And I like the sight of space-age equipment manned by youngsters clad in dungarees and sound-powered phones that their grandfathers would still recognize. I like the traditions of the Navy and the men and women who made them. I like the proud names of Navy heroes: Halsey, Farragut, John Paul Jones. A sailor can find much in the Navy: comrades-in-arms, pride in self and country, mastery of the seaman’s trade. An adolescent can find adulthood.

In years to come, a faint echo of engine and rudder orders, a vision of the bright bunting of signal flags snapping at the yardarm, a refrain of hearty laughter in the wardroom and chief’s quarters and messdecks. Gone ashore for good they will grow wistful about their Navy days, when the seas belonged to them and a new port of call was ever over the horizon. Remembering this, they will stand taller and say, “I WAS A SAILOR ONCE. I WAS PART OF THE NAVY &amp; THE NAVY  WILL ALWAYS BE PART OF ME.”

Verify the date of the NIIN assignment.

You will be able to procure a 1980 model snow mobile for ~$37

Stop wasting valuable Naval resources and precious working hours on such frivolous pursuits.

Your lack of dedication as a sailor and shipmate is a constant source of disappointment to our hard working and dedicated leadership. They lack the temporal resources to deal with your tomfoolery. 

As it stands

I apologize for my unprofessional outburst. Such conduct is unbecoming of a professional deckplate leader and esteemed peer mentor.

It is my sincere hope that you will take a round turn on your behavior and begin to exemplify your Naval core values as a model to our younger sailors. As it stands your commitment is deeply lacking and must be remedied at the earliest opportunity.

Let me know if you require any assistance in bettering yourself as a man and as a Petty Officer. I will aid you in seeking the appropriate command mentorship if this is the path you desire.

1376678386.0,1ki58q,What are the Navy's expectations toward shaving?,RavenDT,46,25,95,"I happened to be in the smoke pit today

The event happened like this:  Being assigned to a watch, four days on, three days off, etc.  I was on my four days off when I get a call from my LPO stating that they had corrections for me to make on my eval and needed me to make corrections before 1400 that day.  I received this phone call at 1000, and I was still in bed.  I rogered up, got out of bed, took a shower, opted not to shave

I enter the building.  Being in a joint environment

Throughout the two hours I was sitting at a random desk (mind you, I get approached by a couple different Army guys who recognized me and asked me about my shave.  My response, ""It's my day off, I'm not on duty, I am not in uniform, and therefore am not required to shave.""  ""Well, in the Army, bro

Time passes, and I said, ""Good, Sir.  I am just about finished.""  Then he asks me about my shave.  As it turns out, the Army folks who had approached me didn't like my response [although I was respectful to them, (I really didn't say, ""Sorry, because to my knowledge there wasn't one.  He said

Once I completed my eval, just please try to use your best judgement.""  ""I did, Sir.  The entire time I've been in the Navy, and at all the different duty stations and commands that I've been assigned to, I have never been told that I was required to shave on a day off out of uniform.  I thought my judgement was sound, but apparently not.""  And then I walked out.

Now fast-forward to today.  I am conversing with a civilian, but it's a poor example to be setting for junior personnel.""

Hold the phone.  Following the uniform regulations and not doing anything wrong is setting a bad example?  If the Navy wanted us shaved 24/7, regardless of leave or liberty status.""  They didn't, and as such, we are not required. The regulation states specifically, ""If you are in uniform, you are to be clean-shaven,"" unless you have a proper medical waiver/chit due to health reasons (no-shave chit)

So I respectfully ask her this.  She then proceeds to consult a new Chief and a CPO Selectee on the same matter.  They all agree that not shaving is not a ""mastable"" offense, because it's not wrong, and they still reiterate that, ""It's not setting a good example for junior personnel.""

Again

Also, who was telling me this, did the following while trying to ""correct"" my way of thinking:

* She was in a covered smoking area with her cover on.  When under cover
* She had her other hand in her pants pocket.
* Her cover was stained on the front brim, that hole was worn in through extensive wearing and she should have replaced it a LONG time ago.
* She had her jacket unzipped 90% of the way (10% zipped). If you are wearing a jacket in uniform

I know this sounds ridiculous

I am eager to know what you all think.  Thank you.

First of all

So, and spent 7 years at RIVRON.  I was there for Iraq, twice.  I've been through every training cycle imaginable, and have every qualification this command offers enlisted side.  I've shot every weapon on the boat, and been in combat next to SEALs, CASEVAC'd marines, done ground patrols, and even loaded the latest craft into another vessel and deployed from that ship.  Every step of training along the way is done with enlisted side by side with their officers.  School of Infantry?  Yup.  RCS?  Yep.  RST?  You got it.  When we are in traditional naval environments, they eat and play with the enlisted.  The respect is always there

Also, go learn about Intel.  Intel weeny?  Get in touch with the enginemen.  Every single person learns every single trade after mastering their own.  No, an Enginemen can't wholely replace an ET, but they sure as hell can program the radios for the next guy!

Back to the point, and it saddens me.  We're moving from a pipeline that was created and carried on by Marines into a true blue water construct.  We will likely maintain a very small brown water presence.  We've already accepted that we will no longer be able to do 10 hour hikes just to ensure our kits fit properly, that everything is silent as we move, getting a quality pace count, and adjusting all of our added gear as our ""work day"".  Our mission has changed.

It's main focus is to help future sailors learn what they need to know before they get to RTC. After seeing many people struggle to learn the material in DEP meetings I thought something like this would be helpful, quizzes, and games for the different subjects. You can also choose an amount of time to study for, and it will keep track of it for you.

Hey everyone. I've been eagerly researching the military for nearly two years

Here are some of my details so you can get an idea of what got me accepted:

* I am a 24-year-old male.
* I am a journalism major with a 3.85 GPA. My package was submitted in November, which isn't a competitive/stellar college. (EDIT: I mean, I loved the college and had a ton of difficult coursework. I am not knocking the quality of the college, but I guess people tend to care about the esteem associated with name/history/price tag/exclusivity and whatnot, and I know CSUN doesn't rank in that regard)
* I took the ASTB and scored a 6/7/7 55. It's not a horrible score
* I have no athletic experience/club leadership/etc. However
* I have four years of work experience in offices
* I have a half-sleeve tattoo on my right arm that required a waiver because it cannot be properly covered with PT gear.
* I wrote a balls good motivational statement

If I think of anything else that may have assisted the decision to pro-rec me

-------------

**EDIT:** AlwaysInconsolable brings up a good point: Just because you have a degree does not mean you should feel obligated to pursue being an officer. There are pros and cons for officers and enlisted alike. You should be concerned with what *you* want to be doing and how you can best do that thing.

I think this might not be the best one to start with as it involves knowing a bit about arresting gear. But it's what I was thinking about this morning. So here it is - it's a touch long so I'll give the tl;dr - created rather massive clang and bent some really thick steal

When: 1989

Where: USS Carl Vinson - Alameda (in port)

What: Fluid transfer out of number 3 arresting gear engine

Why: Maintenance on MEC

This is technical - maybe not appropriate but I thought I'd give it a stab.

We were at our home port in Alameda and I had duty on a Saturday. I was an E-3 Aviation Boatswain Mate Equipmentman working in the arresting gear shop of the V-2 division. I'd been left a pretty simple job to do

I have a 3rd class with me that day

An arresting gear engine has two pistons

In our case

The MEC needed to be repacked because it had totally blown out on our last trip. We had stripped the 3 wire with it stroked in and it was sitting that way still

I let some ships hp air feed into the engine and opened things up - but no fluid was moving. That seemed odd, was to go ahead and add more pressure. Pretty soon I had that thing up nice and high (don't remember the exact number any more but it was way higher than it should have taken) and still, the fluid was not moving.

That's when it hit me. The retract valve was closed and keeping the fluid from moving out of the accumulator. I turned to PO3 Jackson and said - ""Hey

From the engine room to deck-edge was a little ways, that's also just when he opened the valve.

All that pressure slammed the piston out of the MEC like a giant hydraulic hammer. The entire engine is encased in a frame made of steel i-beams. Picture the stuff sky scrapers are made off. That crosshead hit the back so hard it bent the entire beam. It was a sound I'll never forget

We got the fluid transferred and called it done for the day.

The next morning I left the boat early. My PO-1 who ran the shop was on duty on the brow. I asked him for permission to leave and took off with a cold feeling in my gut. Figured I'd enjoy some time off the boat in case I didn't get any again for a while.

When I came back that night he found me in the berthing and said, ""Well, I didn't know how it would go down and figured I'd better take off.""

He was more mad at that than the accident. We took care of that quietly and I learned to trust him. He worked us like dogs

Here's a photo of a couple arresting gear engines - you can see what the frames are like by looking at what the operator is sitting on.

1351645950.0,12dftc,Corpsman (HM) FAQ/Guide,Scratius,20,7,37,"So

About me, followed by Field Medical Training Battalion (FMTB) in Camp Lejeune. After that I spent 2 years in Groton, CT as a quad zero (nec 0000) and became interested in the lab. After that I attended Laboratory Technician ""C"" school in San Antonio, TX. I got to see the opening of Corpsman Basic in San Antonio and I know quite a few instructors from my previous commands. Now I'm in Charleston, SC working in the lab.

On to the questions:

Q: What the hell is a corpsman anyways?

A: A corpsman is any enlisted medical personnel in the Navy. If you want to do anything medical wise in the Navy

Q: Ok

A: Corpsman are able to be stationed anywhere that has a Navy or Marine Corps presence. There are many different places and platforms. Hospitals, submarines, squadrons, Marine divisions, the list goes on and on. Also, as we become more of a ""joint"" military corpsman are getting stationed with the Airforce and Army. 

Q: The Marine Corps? I thought I was joining the Navy!

A: Yes, eat with them, and go to war with them. While the draw downs have slowed deployments it is still very likely that you will go with the marines. Most young males go through FMTB after corps school. 

Q: How's advancement as a corpsman?

A: Since the HM rating is so large the competition can be fierce. As an active duty HM you will compete with every other HM in that rank regardless of specialty or duty station. However

Q: What are some of the specialties available to a corpsman?

A: There are 39 different specialties or Navy Enlisted Classification's (NEC's). These are communities withing the corpsman rating that require a ""C"" school. 

As of 2011 all entry level ""C"" schools are in San Antonio

I'll just do these 2 today and I'm hoping some others will follow as I like to hear these from others. Oh - and here's a pretty pic to go with what I think is the most interesting part of the story.
http://www.airbase.ru/cache/hangar/planes/usa/f/f-14/pix//1024x768/f14tu95.jpg

Where: Somewhere in the Pacific not far from Russia

When: 1989

Why: Keep the sea lanes open and such

What: Tag with Russian aircraft

After my first WESPAC was done in December of '88. We did some different stuff through the first half of '89 (workups, etc.). Then in September of '89 we headed out for PACEX '89. It was the largest peacetime naval exercise since WWII. We had 3 carrier groups, and did some stuff involving the air force and foreign militaries. We spent a lot of time up around the Aleutian islands. It was frigging cold. The seas were choppy and it was just nasty up there. I did get to see something pretty cool though, B-1s doing some high speed maneuvers up there. (Years later I was at an airshow and they had paintings of a B-1 flying low over the water, with water being thrown up in the bomber's wake. They guy their told me the painting was inspired by flying he saw done during that exercise.)

With the cold weather, our cranials covered the back of our head. Back in the gear we had a fork lift that we kept parked back by the hatch down to the barricade storeroom. We would run it and stand around the warm exhaust. I'm sure I lost more than a few brain cells getting warm that way.

I still felt bad for the guys on the small boys. I believe our plane gaurd at the time was the USS Arkansas. When we were bobbing up and down I could look off and see her just plunging through the waves. If it moves a carrier around--you know a cruiser is having a wild ride. This was nothing though compared to a storm we would get into on our way back from Korea at the end of the exercise.

Operating in the Aleutians was interesting. The little islands were all over and we were cruising around in them. For flight ops you have to keep a minimum of 30 knotts of wind across the deck- that's launch and recovery. So usually you just turn into the wind and cruise in that direction to help out. In the islands we were constantly turning as islands would get in our way. (an interesting note-- top speed on a nimitz class carrier is classified

We worked our tails off. The big brass had us throwing up all kinds of packages constantly. We moved from event to event with very little down time for maintenance. With a full air group-- V-2 can get worked hard without even pushing the squadrons too much. I'm sure the pilots were working hard-- but we had to be at it regardless of who was in the air

We had ramped up to alert five early on and we would play games. The Soviets would send out Bear and Badger bombers. We would launch alert fives and other fighters to escort them. We would also put up our own full packages with the E-2s and other aircraft (EA-6B, A-7 and SH-60F). The guys in combat control would pick up inbound aircraft and then they would call away the launch on the 1-MC. For an alert 5 they would give the initial vector of the aircraft when they called it away. I think this was to get the ship headed the way they would go to save time- but I'm not sure.

Much like when we were up in the gulf this got old fast. Especially here when we knew there would be no shooting. When we were at alert 5 status we had to be manned up constantly. We slept on the deck and they brought us our meals in boxes. And every so often the 1MC would call out- ""Now launch the alert 5 figher. Initial vector One Two Three"" or something on that order. And sometimes a little while later we would get a glimpse of a Russian bomber being shadowed by one or two of our Tomcats. One sunny afternoon I heard something extremely unique- and I doubt it has happened too often- I would think this might be the only time. It was (and this is verbatim) - ""Now launch the alert 5 fighter. Initial vector overhead."" We stopped

I don't know how it happened or what the aftermath was. Rumors were some officer in CC got busted pretty hard-- but I have no idea how true that was. It was pretty wild though. Basically we were caught with our pants down in a big way.

Well the most important question for me is if I should volunteer for the leadership position when they ask for volunteers. I know you all said that it's good because it gets you out of a lot of shit but it also puts you into a lot of it. 

I was in NJROTC in high school and was a PC my junior year. That same year I won Honor Platoon. I know that I am a good leader and I can direct and teach. My senior year I was the battalion XO so I KNOW what kind of responsibility I am looking at and I know how hot goes down. Being the XO I had to be a dick to get things done. I wasn't a dick just because I could I only did when I needed to get shit done and that was the only thing that would beat into there head. With all that being said here is my problem. Also tho already means I'm an e3 so promotion is not motivating me at all because you can't go past e3 in basic.

I love leading and I know I can lead successfully on bootcamp. So that's not the problem. But before I knew you could et jobs in basic I was literally just going to be a ghost and mind my own business. 

So I'm asking if it's really worth being the leader in basic? Do you all wish you volunteered for it? It's not a matter of IF I can because I know I could it's just a matter of I don't want more attention then I really need. If its better to just stick in the back then that's all fine an dandies but if being the leader is what would make things go smoother and more enjoyable then I don't mind that.

Keep in mind that I don't have the whole (I want to get by doing as little as possible attitude) its just that I don't want any more attention then I have to put up with in bootcamp. Outside of bootcamp leadership is what I need because I enjoy being over people. But during bootcamp the outcome will be the same in 8 weeks worthier or not I volunteer to be the leader. So should I do it or not?

So you have a Bachelor's degree and you want to join the Navy?  Great!

You have exactly **two** options:

* **Try for Officer Candidate School**.  Getting into OCS requires testing, Intel, etc.) irregularly and sometimes only once a year.  It could be a year or more before you get an answer and then the acceptance rates are still quite low (~10%).  With a few exceptions the Academy and ROTC boys get first choice on assignments within those communities, so you'll go where Uncle Sam needs you.  Officer pay, prestige (and most would say the ""lifestyle"") is better, but officers must lead other men and take on managerial responsibility.  If this interests you, speak with an *Officer* Recruiter (Enlisted Recruiters have an incentive to get you to enlist).  Be aware that Officer Recruiters can seem aloof or disinterested because you need them much more than they need you.

* **Enlist**.  Enlisting only requires a high school diploma, but that's the military.  After some time it is possible to apply for OCS from within the enlisted community, but your acceptance is far from guaranteed; even if things go perfectly you'll still need to go through the OCS wringer as described above.

We had a new sailor come in after he had finished A-school to answer some questions at a DEP meeting we had. Subject of wisdom teeth came up and he basically said that if you're active duty and you have 'em, not too bad. Just had some questions:

* Mine are not breached at all. Does this have any influence on whether they take them out? Does it have any influence on whether they sedate me or not? Everyone I have talked to (out of the navy) said that if they're not breached then it's minor surgery

* I'm not going to be on a sub and am very unlikely to be on a ship with my job. Again

* I know that I can't just get a note from my dentist or whatever

I know that these are real doctors and I'm not worried. I know that it's a very routine thing that they do all the time. Again,False,self,t5_2rg06,False,,,t3_1baj1d
