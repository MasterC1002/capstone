Nobody should make changes in their life purely to fulfill an ideal. The whole point of making life changes is not so you can tick a box on a census form saying ""I'm a minimalist, to allow you to enjoy life more. Minimalism is a great way of doing this, but if your end goal is to **be a minimalist** then I can't help but think you're doing it wrong. Your end goal should be to be happier, after all, isn't that really the only thing that matters in life?

I've recognized that I really enjoy reading on new topics, and working out. 

I am also aware that I spend a lot of time just browsing reddit

Something has always made me aware that video games

Video games, feel some happiness, then just pick up the remote and tune in. 

However, but nothing great. 


Consider on the other hand, and even then you are constantly trying to improve. 

Yet look back on a past week where you nailed a new song

As minimalists we have said we will remove all garbage from our lives so that we can focus on what makes us happy and brings meaning to our lives -- yet so many of us are drawn to the low hanging fruit. 

I've seen many people on this subreddit say they spend their time playing video games

Have you ever wondered why so many people ask ""well if you don't watch TV what do you do?"" ""Aren't you bored?"" -- people who want to quit playing video games have to ask what they could possibly spend their time doing instead. 

What people are really searching for is the low hanging fruit. This easy steady drip of happiness. Their question is

I myself have struggled with this. I want to quit video games, but what do you do that doesn't take so much work?"" -- I mean who really spends a whole day wood working or walking? They must fill the rest of their time somehow? Where is their easy drip? 

Now imagine for a second. What if there were no easy drips? No easy way to get a steady stream of happiness? What if all your happiness and satisfaction and meaning had to be worked for -- hard effort must be applied to everything you do before the happiness will arrive. 

You might sit on your ass all day and drink beer

You will find that you will still seek happiness and especially a deep satisfaction with your life. And so you don't sit there blind waiting for something easy to show up

You find these hobbies

Each week you will achieve new accomplishments

Eventually you get addicted to these bigger rushes of happiness, video games, or other things.

-----

Addendum:

I think we experience this addiction to hard but satisfying activities on some level. 

You might spend most of your day in front of the television

You might be a runner

Ask these people

I'm sure you have something in your life that you feel the same about.  It's the deep happiness and satisfaction you feel that makes you so protective over this hard hobby. 

We all have these addictions to activities which provide us with bigger flows of happiness

What I am suggesting is that if we can remove all of the easy drips of happiness

Picture whatever it is that grants you so much happiness right now

Now imagine if every moment of your day was spent doing activities like it which granted you the same amount of satisfaction

Each day would hold 10x the amount of happiness, month, and year were well spent. 

And to me

EDIT: I'm amazed at the response to this post. I'm glad most of you enjoyed and were inspired by what I had to say. I had to look twice when I had 25 orangered in my mailbox!

1356838029.0,15nmo0,My mother was a hoarder. She lived in the house for 30 years before I moved in. This is the story of our recovery to cleanliness and simplicity.,catsmakegreatpillows,482,72,96," My mom is my best friend, but good grief the house. She's healthy, but oh god the house. Words fail. It's on a half acre of trees and her hoarding covered the whole lot. inside and out. The city sent blight notices and threats of fines and things were escalating.

She was always what we would call, or unusual stones on a walk. But she also took my great-grandmother's lessons from the Depression and her own youth in poverty to heart - so she hoarded rubber bands, prescription bags, envelopes, paper (Oh god the paper), etc. She was a psychiatric nurse specializing in pediatrics, she is a literacy tutor, and origami teacher - so there was paper, everything you could possibly imagine. She loved to shop at Goodwill and yard sales when she was lonely, and always stacks of books. Ten years ago my dad died and in her grief things got much worse. It took years for her to recover

My mom moved to a small hippie community in the woods and once there her social group grew, and she stopped her compulsive buying. Once she was secure there she gave me permission to clean up the house. She said she wanted to clean up but was totally overwhelmed and didn't even know where or how to start.

When I moved in two years ago, the house stank of cat and dog urine. The yard was incredible, the trees overgrown, the house was in ruins.

My boyfriend and I have worked so hard the last couple years. I started outside so the city would get off my back. I mulched the yard in two feet of wood mulch to smother the grass, no other room was liveable. 

Then I started in the house. I set a goal of one room per month, and art supplies. The firepit and garbage and recycling bin got more than I will ever admit. 

I put in place a couple of rules:
1. If it doesn't get used in six months
2. No furniture unless it's quality
3. I have to be able to keep up the house by myself- so the simpler the better. 
4. No upgrades- just stripping away, fences, bright new lights, new paint - room by room I'm fixing it up, simplifying, baring down to something simple and clean. The yard is better and better, the house has beautiful bones and is so bright and pretty now. It's still an old house

My mom comes to visit a few times a year and is so thankful to me. I don't have to pay rent. :) I just keep cleaning and simplifying the house, a woodshop, a metal shop, a little forge and garden, the animals are clean and healthy, the yard looks great, we can have guests over, I have a five year plan. My goal is to be able to rent or sell the property if I want to move. The way it was it might have been scraped or condemned and it's a beautiful old house.

I'm writing this because I just kind of finished - I cleaned out my mom's room yesterday. It took seventeen trash bags. I've never seen her room look like this in my life. This was the last room of The Crazy, clean and liveable now. I can't wait to see her face.

Minimalism isn't just a philosophy to me - it'a love letter to my mom, and  part of my mission to better myself and my family so we can have a good future. We're winning with every room cleaned and emptied. One of the rooms is our own bright clean little bedroom now.  :)

You don't need to buy anything to help you be minimal. Don't throw out a bed and buy a futon to be more minimal. Don't buy a new ""minimalistic"" wallet because your old one suddenly won't do anymore. Don't buy a set of identical clothing and throw out perfectly good ones. Trim down what you have.

I (we) have a lot of friends (and family...) who like spending (my SO and I are quite frugal even though we make a good living and don't need to watch our money) on stupid things and I'm not trying to change them - if it makes them happy (or whatever)

However I really hate it when we're given gifts. Now I appreciate the thought, potted flowers, etc.

The thing is that after the gift is received one can never get rid of it without offending the gift-giver. The stupid crap just stays with you for ever and ever and I'd really like to put an end to it.

I've tried talking to those who do this more often and it never ends well. It usually leads down the ""if you're cheap it doesn't mean I have to be"" path, they just don't understand...

I understand that minimalism is different for everyone so we don't need to flood this thread with that kind of talk.  I hope you enjoy my take on it!  I love the idea of extreme minimalism

Though I think the pics don't do it justice, condoms, tape, a reusable produce bag, etc.

I know that might still be difficult to put together(how do you fill a canvas organizer with all that crap?  So I've pulled out all of my make up to show you guys what I have...so for a city girl who likes to wear make up and go out I think this make up bag is pretty minimalistic! :D

I think that's why you'll often read ""that's not what minimalism is"" in this subreddit. Not because we don't recognize someone's photo or words as minimal

I like experimenting with asceticism, I'll lie awake at night thinking about what to get rid of next. 

A person who just gets rid of the superfluous stuff in his house and limits future accumulation can also call himself a minimalist. Going outside of his comfort zone might not ever be necessary or desirable to him. 

I might be addicted to the feeling I get when I toss something

I'm 38. I have 2 kids

Over the past year I have sold all 800 of my LPs and 45s, Brautigan), 200 DVDs/Blu Rays, 4 guitars, and countless pieces of vintage hi-fi equipment. I now have all my music on a mac mini hooked up to a receiver. 

During this whole process, and other useless crap. 

Just today we cleaned out the kitchen and got rid of two large rubbermaid totes worth of stuff - extra glasses, dishes, appliances, etc.

We've never been hoarders, our house, and our bank account. We began to realize that our kids did not appreciate gifts, new toys, etc and were always looking for their next fix. I could buy my son a new DS game and he'd be wanting another on two days later. Granted, he's six…but still.

4 weeks ago we turned the TV off and have only turned it on about an hour or two a day - mostly when I'm at work. All of the commercials were getting to me and I started to resent how they worked their magic on my kids. Even though I'm missing out on some shows I enjoy, a gadget, or whatever else they're hocking. Outside of gas, bills, and the few times I've brought pizza home for dinner, I've not spent a single dime in a month. I take that back. I bought a bag of apple candy.

My goal isn't to get down to barely nothing. My goal is to get down to only what is needed and

I can walk into my kitchen, and my kids rooms now and not feel like I have failed them. We were worried at first that giving the kids an ultimatum of only keeping what would fit in one cedar chest would make them resentful or bored - that they would feel bad when they went to a friend's house and saw that they had so many more toys than them. But then we realized, this was simply social conditioning. Years of TV have made us think that was the norm and IT'S NOT. I'm happy to say that my 6 year old really got into the joy of giving his toys to kids who may not have any. My daughter's too young to understand but she never got upset either.

Our 2600 sq ft house is starting to feel a bit bare and I'm loving it. It just makes me want to move to a smaller house and save more money on utilities

**DON'T try to go through all of these at once, then **stop listening** and stick to your new exciting discovery.

Minimalist music emphasizes aspects of music which are often left to the background: rhythm and texture are paramount, relaxed place, or it can lay out a difficult path that leads your mind to beautiful things.

Minimalist music started out as a classical movement, as does Billboard Top 40s pop – surprised? Don't be. The emphasis on danceable rhythms and on highly-produced texture may not lead to minimalist pop (ha!) but it's partially rooted in that movement. In fact, I found that liking minimalist music led to my _loving_ modern pop music! I used to think that modern songwriters were just less talented and elegant than the old ones. Then I realized they were just writing songs to entirely different rules, and that minimalism was what helped discover many of those rules in the first place.

Anyway

**Easy Listening**

Instead of sticking to historical progression, and the later stuff I sit and focus on.

Let's start with one of the most immediately gorgeous pieces ever written

[Steve Reich – Music for 18 Musicians](http://grooveshark.com/s/Music+For+18+Musicians/2Vx9Bc?src=5). This piece is like the music of the spheres to me: subtle, plus an opening and closing ""pulse"", but I picked a track which would play the whole thing instead of making you click for each movement. Every section is built around a single chord, and for several minutes plays with rhythmic variations on that chord. What makes it work is the texture of the musicians Reich assembled, who combined sound just otherworldly. 

[Ludovico Einaudi – Stella del mattino](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWKwQ2gBRc0). Einaudi doesn't like being called a minimalist, but lovely nonetheless.

[The xx – Crystalized](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pib8eYDSFEI). A recent pop group that writes songs about as stripped down as they get. It's catchy

Time for another one of the minimalist greats:

[Terry Riley – In C](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjR4QYsa9nE). Riley was one of the earliest minimalists. In C was his response to classical music that was too cluttered, but that changes literally every time it's played. You can play it with any number and combination of instruments – check out [this MetaFilter post](http://www.metafilter.com/79702/Oh-Say-Can-You-See-The-Way-I-Play-In-C) to hear it played by French guitarists, a Chinese orchestra, a voice-and-percussion group, and so many more.

[Brian Eno – St. Elmo's Fire](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-3djUYgebU). Eno is ENORMOUS, David Bowie, Talking Heads, and Coldplay, among countless others. St. Elmo's Fire is from an album in which Eno was moving away from loud, violent rock and towards something quieter and textural. Despite its minimalist leanings, it has IMHO one of the greatest guitar solos of all time

[The Velvet Underground – All Tomorrow's Parties](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-3djUYgebU). The Velvet Underground were maybe the most minimalist-influenced rock outfit of the 1960s. John Cale, La Monte Young (on whom more later – he's difficult). TVU wrote some shocking rock music, and one of their oft-repeated tactics was to use dense, interesting patterns, like All Tomorrow's Parties drum-and-piano combo. 

**Interlude**

We're about to get into something considerably more difficult, by a modern cello composer that I think highlights the potential and beauty of minimalist music. One of his pieces is quite known; the rest are sadly not; but they are all fantastic.

[Giovanni Sollima – Terra Aria](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldPf3yqq3-8). This one's semi-famous music video illustrates the nature of its minimalist composition. Lasse Gjertsen filmed Sollima playing each of its parts on a single cello

[Giovanni Sollima – Trio](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0X5omVuKDBQ). A quiet

[Giovanni Sollima – Violoncelles

[Giovanni Sollima – Concerto](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhKSIJw7Gzk). The first movement in a four-part composition. This and the last piece come from an album called We Were Trees

There is a big turningpoint in my life right now. Broke up with my 4 year relation with my girlfriend. Heart is still broken but my eyes are opened!
Minimalism was already in my house but now I see the benefits more and more. For me it's a mind thing and a joy for my eyes.
It makes me feel more clear and focussed.
Minimalism makes me think about the things that really matter.
Not that my life was a big mess but I just needed a push in the right direction. Ending of the relation was it. Her friends weren't mine and she never really committed herself to me. Now I see that and accept it. I see that I must do and act what I really love and makes me happy.

Symptoms are: Muscle tension. Sleep disturbance. Body checking.
Self-mutilation.

Minimalism drastically helped me to fight anxiety.

And in my case
and having a clean room.

**BELONGINGS**

2 years ago
Bed, dish washer, TV, phones, consoles, DVDs,
computers, a computer,
and a mobile phone. I made sure that all the things I owned would
fit in only one bag. I've learned later that this way of living
is called **Minimalism**.

I own 15 ""things"". This is how I count them:

* Cloths (2 pants
* Toilet bag (shaver
* A jacket
* 2 computers (for work)
* 2 phones (for work)
* Headphones
* A watch
* A passport
* Wallet with 3 cards and cash
* A Nintendo 3DS
* A Kindle
* A V60 (coffee dripper)
* A backpack

I love being able to count the things I own. For some reasons
it makes me feel better. The less things I own
the less things I need to worry about.

**NO HOME &amp; TRAVELING**

I don't have what most of the people refer as a ""home"".
I rent furnished apartments (mostly on Airbnb lately).

I'm lucky enough to have a job that lets me work remotely (not from
an office). I can work from home
So I started moving a lot. Jumping from an apartment to another.
I think the longest I stayed in a city was in Berlin for 6 months (I'm French).

I stopped watching TV and started meeting people from different cultures.
I have been to most of the European countries. To America. To Asia.

As I'm writing this
to worry about.

This feeling of having just one bag and being able to jump
from a city to another

**DISCONNECTING**

Same thing goes with ""connections"". I like to be able to count the
number of entities (public administrations) that know about me.

* My employer
* Taxes administration
* My bank
* French social security
* Mobile broadband company

If my *official address* changes
notify. I say *official address* because I move so often I needed to use
my parent's as a proxy.

I'm actually annoyed by the fact the you're supposed to have a ""home"".
I guess for legal reasons you just can't avoid that.
Also, but it's impossible (bank needs one).

**BENEFITS**

**Freedom**. Feeling *self contained*. When I picture myself
with a bag filled with 15 things
""administrations"". And that makes me feel a little more serene.

**Time**. That is that most surprising thing
jumping from a city to another. So many things happen in my life during
these 2 years
explain that easily. The more you experiment
The more memories you have

Maybe you have recommendations about what could be my next steps. What I could improve.
Maybe you have some questions for me. I could talk more about how I manage my money. How friendship is hard (when moving so often). What exactly my anxiety problems are. How I plan my future life.

A few months ago I decided to stop carrying a purse. I almost exclusively wear jeans

I dumped out my purse and all the contents of my wallet and I asked myself what do I actually *need* on a day-to-day basis? Money, and phone. I ended up using a tiny binder clip as a makeshift money clip for my debit card, student ID, and driver's license.

My keys are on a carabiner with no extra keychains and it hooks to one of my back belt loops.

I remember standing with my mother in her kitchen about ten years ago and looking at all the tchotchkes she had amassed over 59 years.  I said, why don't you cull through these things and simplify your kitchen?""  

She scoffed

""But

""Yep.  Oh

She died in 2007.  And not one item in that kitchen has been moved since.

Fast forward two years to 2009:  My husband and I decided to move our family to our favorite place

As we started packing and culling through the accumulation of ten years of marriage and two young kids in a 3, ""Do we really need it in Florida?""  Every time I picked up a paper mâché owl from 6th grade or a piece of scribble art from my 2-year-old, I'd cringe at the thought of throwing them away.  We compromised by taking pictures of all the artwork, of me holding or wearing sentimental items like trophies or sweaters.  We digitally captured box after box of memorabilia.  My consolation was that if I was ever sentimental, I could pull up my pictures and reminisce.  

I have never looked at those pictures.  Ever.

We sold or gave away every piece of furniture, and a little side table that was my grandmother's.  We then moved into a furnished, two bedroom, 900 sqft condo in Florida, and we were STILL surrounded by boxes and boxes of STUFF.

We finally bought a 3-bedroom, such as our bills.  We cut out cable and DISH TV, cut Netflix to streaming only, and worked hard on using natural light instead of electricity to light the house during the day. I also didn't mind the humidity and heat of the summer so much, so I turned off the A/C quite often and opened the windows.

Due to a new job, such as paying off our cars, which we plan on using until they are run into the ground!)  And although I feel like we got rid of almost everything again like our first move, including my grandmother's side table and aunt's breakfront, I realized that this time, we aren't living among walls of boxes.  Then it occurred to me why that is--- all our boxes and stuff is in storage, waiting for us to buy our new house in July.  Ugh.

Now I'm almost depressed, extra shoes, books, kitchen items, and who knows what else I've forgotten we even own!  I feel like I'm gearing up to tackle a tidal wave of crap.

Right now, shorts, shoes each), minimal kitchen supplies (god, I miss our grill and smoker, though), minimal bath supplies, and we are just fine.

So, for all intents and purposes, a hoarder.  I've come so far from these moves, and I've thankfully prevented myself from falling into that hoarding lifestyle.  I want to keep on pursuing the minimalist lifestyle, even though I've been sort of forced into it by necessity with each move.  It has freed our family to have more space, more peace, more money

Has anyone else been forced to minimalize

* Get a piece of paper and a writing implement.

* Go outside.

* Make a list of **all** the objects that are important to you (from memory) -- table, silverware, etc..

* Go back inside and make a new list of all of the things you couldn't remember off the top of your head (nothing from the old list should go on the new list).

* Now look at the new list and ask yourself

The rationale, how important can it be? This idea stems from my parents who have so much junk piled up in their basement that they don't even know most of what they own. When they need something, there's a high chance that they won't know whether or not they already own it, so they'll go out and buy it again (like a hammer or something).

My sister and I have gone out shopping on Black Friday for the past 4 or 5 years. We don't get up early but around 9 we start meandering around. I wasn't super excited about it but I figured I'd go anyways because we live 8 hours apart and I just don't see her often and I had some shopping I'd been putting off. 

Throughout the day I saw lots of things that were cheap or great deals especially DVDs and I just realized I wasn't really interested in them. Through a morning of shopping I ended up just a few things:

*a second copy of a game that my boyfriend and I have nearly worn out
*two new pairs of jeans (in a smaller size
*another board game (the BF and I spend a lot of nights at home playing games)

1341846759.0,w9u1j,FAQ,,134,17,38,"I think there should be a Frequently Asked Question page. Here's what should be in it.

Q:What does minimalism Mean?

A:Minimalism is the act of reducing the things in your life to only what is necessary. Some people only reduce physical objects

Q:Why be a minimalist?

A:Life is short

Q:How can I start being a minimalist?

A:Try an exercise called the three month rule. Write down all the things you use in three months. Anything not on the list after that time

Q:How do I deal with getting rid of objects that have sentimental value to me?

A:Consider taking photographs of objects that have special meaning to you. The pictures will take up no room in cyber-space, or a video. Store all of these files on an external hard drive, to make sure that they don't get deleted if your computer dies.

Q:How minimal should I be?

A:That is a matter of preference. Some people are only minimally minimal because they reduce just the things that get in the way. Some people are excessively minimal; they live out of just a backpack. A good place in the middle

Q:Should I get rid of X item?

A:If you are not sure you'll need or want something

Q:How do I deal with knowing that I am losing money when I get rid of things?

A:You aren't actually wasting the money that you spent

Q:I've just had a radical change in my life

A:Absolutely not. If you are in a heightened, you might feel different a few months, weeks, or even days from now than you already do. Wait until you are feeling like your normal self before making such a radical life change.

Q:I still can't decide how minimalist I want to be!

A:You don't have to decide what level you want to be at

Q:My parents/spouse/ex gay lover/cat is not okay with my being a minimalist. OR

A:

1. Explain to this person that you are a minimalist

2. Explain that even if they don't want to reduce

3. Explain that you are willing to make compromises with them if they are willing to make compromises with you.

4. If your roommate/robot/yoga instructor/fellow twilight enthusiast isn't able to agree with the above three steps, you'll have to deal with it.

Q:I just got rid of a bunch of stuff

A:Great! This is called ""purging"" and we all do it. It would be appreciated if you took before and after pictures

Q:Somebody made a post about digital minimalism

A:Hold your britches

Q:Somebody posted a product on here

A:Don't downvote based on advertising. Usually the redditor is just trying to share inside knowledge about a product that you wouldn't be able to attain unless you bought it. This is widely appreciated here. It is pretty unlikely that any company would spend money advertising on such a small subreddit. There isn't a large enough audience to make a profit from it.

Q:How can I help out this subreddit?

A:

1. Tell your friends

2. Post before/after pictures of purging. Put all the things you are throwing away in a pile, photograph all of your belongings together when you are about to move.

3. Comment (kindly) on people's posts.

4. Don't just read the ""what's hot"" tab. Also go to the ""new"" tab to see posts which are new and haven't been upvoted yet.

5. Don't downvote just because someone has a different opinion than you. Only downvote if they are legitimately being offensive to you

Q:I don't like this FAQ. It looks bad and you should feel bad!

A:This is why we can't have nice things...",,t5_2r0z9,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/w9u1j/faq/

1. **I deleted every social networking site/app I've ever used, and simple. I don't waste time on it. I can send a tweet in five seconds, as much as I want.

2. **I switched to using only one e-mail**. I had five or so e-mails. One for Yahoo, one for that. Over time I just found myself making different accounts because I needed to create one to use their service; G-mail to use my Android phone, Yahoo to get on Yahoo Answers, etc. This wouldn't be a bad thing, except for the past few years I have signed up for different stuff with different e-mails, so I had to balance all of these e-mails, remember them all, updated all of my contacts, check out the new Outlook.com e-mail: it is the most elegant and simple e-mail I have ever used.

It's only been one week, or consider posting it on FaceBook/Google+, I don't need to edit it at all or put a filter or anything. I don't have a a bunch of friends sending me Snapchats that I have to hold down for a few seconds just to view, I don't have FaceBook notifications blowing up my phone/e-mail, I don't spend thirty minutes on the internet before I actually do what I got on the computer to do in the first place.

I don't necessarily believe that social media is evil, and probably always will be. I think it's best to just choose your favorite, and *only* use that social media. Just one, if that. I think signing up for all these new apps/sites that are coming out (Vine, Instagram, Snapchat, Google+, Tumblr

In just this one week, I make one tweet about it, and that's it. I'm not posting it on every single social site I used before, making it perfect, with a perfect picture, etc. And when I get on my phone, having just one social app makes my life much easier, whereas before, clarity

Last week

The whole experience has been very eye-opening for me about the stuff we collect in our lives. When forced to decide what to keep and what to throw out, since she's not back in the country to help us yet). Nothing else was worth it to her to keep. It made me realize how much of what we hold on to doesn't mean anything in the long run. A whole lifetime worth of physical things was boiled down to a sweater, a lock-box, papers, and some jewelry.

In the aftermath of all this, heartbreaking task of going through mountains of my stuff. Time to throw away everything meaningless/sad/embarrassing/etc!' But then I began to ask myself: at the end of the day, what will I actually leave behind, and what will it say about me? Will it be a house full of junk, offenses that were left unforgiven and unaddressed, etc? 

I've realized that the only real mark I want to leave on this planet are lasting, or clinging to painful memories I won't let go of. Life is too short to anchor yourself to useless 'stuff' like this. Minimalism (to me personally, so take that as you will) isn't just about what I own; it's about ALL of the things I take with me in life. My objects, my thoughts, my friends, etc. I should aim to spend less time with my things and my emotional baggage, and more with the people I love.

Maybe this is just an over-reaction to a sudden tragedy, minimalism as a means to prioritize your life, etc. I might be jumping too eagerly into the deep end here, but I'd love to hear your thoughts.


**TL;DR:** Got super-motivated to pursue minimalism after going through personal items after a death caused to me re-evaluate what's worth keeping in life.

Trash bag by trash bag by trash bag, has now become my entire philosophy. I can get back to my dorm space after a long day from classes and feel zen in my room. Not very many people can say that. 

Going further, I walk around campus, and more. I told my facebook ""friends"" that if they needed me they had my cell number and deactivated it.

If you haven't seen it yet and are a fan of minimalism (high probability if you're reading this) you gotta watch this movie. Here are just a few quotes:

* This is your life and it's ending one minute at a time.
* It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything. 
* The things you own end up owning you. 
* Reject the basic assumptions of civilization
* You're not your job. You're not how much money you have in the bank. You're not the car you drive. You're not the contents of your wallet. You're not your fucking khakis. You're the all-singing
* Like so many others
* I ran. I ran until my muscles burned and my veins pumped battery acid. Then I ran some more. (this
* If you wake up at a different time in a different place, I felt like a different person for a while)
* Look, it was ME!
* We're consumers. We are by-products of a lifestyle obsession. Murder, these things don't concern me. What concerns me are celebrity magazines, television with 500 channels, some guy's name on my underwear. Rogaine, Viagra, Olestra.
* You had to give it to him: he had a plan. And it started to make sense
* Self improvement is masturbation. Now self destruction... (gotta destroy your old self before you can improve)
* Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat. It's not a goddamn seminar. Stop trying to control everything and just let go! LET GO!
* By the end of the first month
* It's just, that's it. That's the last sofa I'm gonna need. Whatever else happens, I've got that sofa problem handled. 
* I had it all. Even the glass dishes with tiny bubbles and imperfections, hard-working indigenous peoples of... wherever. 
* Stop the excessive shopping and masturbation. Quit your job. Start a fight. Prove you're alive. If you don't claim your humanity you will become a statistic.

* Worker bees can leave. Even drones can fly away. The Queen is their slave. (thanks andrewhyde)

I'm beginning to notice a few things about this subreddit and would like to discuss them. For one

Someone once pointed out to me, still, are interested in getting rid of clutter in their life to focus on other things -- like family, friends, etc. And others are a mishmash of different things, becoming interested in the lifestyle through Zen Habits, Miss Minimalist, whatever.

Therefore

1.) Minimalism shouldn't be about obsessing whether or not you have too much of something to the point that you're letting your other interests fade away or the thing that you actually care about becomes clouded. For example, keep them! Minimalism is about getting rid of everything that doesn't work for you -- that weekend you thought you'd become a fisherman and bought all of those rods or those six pair of jeans when you're a sweatpants kinda girl.  In my experience, minimalism has showed me EXACTLY what I do care about because it wouldn't make sense to me to throw away my tablet PC when I spend a lot of time reading and browsing the internet. Those books in the corner though? I don't even miss 'em.

2.) Be your own minimalist! What initially attracted me deeper into minimalism was Zen Habits. I thought the owner was so cool and really enjoyed taking his life slowly. But on the other hand, I was much happier giving my stuff space to breathe.

3.) You don't have to buy a mac to be a minimalist. I know it's trendy and hip, that's cool. I like Windows and Android and all that, but I can appreciate the minimalist aesthetics of Apple.

4.) No one is going to judge you for sleeping on a bed if you want to. Or driving a car. You don't have to worry about every little thing in your life, don't feel like you have to either become super-rich or homeless to be a proper minimalist.

1369833179.0,1f9l9w,Reduce entertainment. Allow ideas to flourish.,minimalisto,105,10,26,"This post may be controversial. You will likely want to defend these things you find precious. All I ask is that you approach the following with an open mind

We all need to stop. 

Each day we are in constant motion. If we are not doing daily chores, socialize, and sleep. 

Any time that we have available in the schedule above

---

Have you ever wondered why many brilliant ideas come to us in the shower? 

What makes standing naked embracing a sputtering shower head of perhaps too hot or too cold water

Doesn't it seem like almost any other place would be better? Like at your desk with your favorite music playing as you sit down to work? 

Ideas also seem to come to us as we try to get much needed sleep, why show up now? 

---

The truth of the matter is

I ask that you put down your entertainment for just a moment

Minimalism needs direction.

The purpose of minimalism is to focus on what makes you happy and/or brings meaning to your life. 

If you do not have the mental clarity to determine what is the crucial and what is the crap -- if you  do not have the time to think over your decisions before you direct your life

That which brings meaning to your life

---

So this is what I propose. Give yourself time. Time to sit inside of yourself

This is not meditation. You are not trying to quiet all thought. Instead you are embracing the thoughts as they come, before moving on. 

You do not will yourself to think on one specific topic. No effort is required. For each subject that comes up

You will be surprised as to where your thoughts lead

---

So where does this time to think

The little gaps you fill with entertainment. For some of us

It would be nice if everyone was less busy, this seems a more universally applicable way. Entertainment is easier to reduce compared to quitting a 9-5 job for instance. 

In your daily life, play a video game, watch a movie, text on your phone, randomly browse your phone out of boredom -- do this instead. 

I realize many of you will be saying that surely you can't get rid of all your television

But do you need entertainment while eating alone? Really

Could you truly not survive for a half hour without a thing to do but sit and rest? 

---

This is what I propose. Find the little gaps at first, and the half hour rests. 

The time spent waiting in line. Time spent waiting for a friend to arrive. Time spent commuting

Take this time and remove from it distraction. Cast away your entertainment for the time being

Give your brain the time it needs to analyze your life, and your last conversation. 

Now watch your time in the shower

---

If you have tried this experiment and found merit


----

Addendum: 

I believe there are many cases where entertainment can be seen doing more good than bad to support my thoughts above. 

Consider running. Some run in a gym on a treadmill watching television and listening to music. 

Some run outdoors with an ipod blaring. 

Yet even with as much motivational music as you can pack into a mp3 player

Running out doors with nothing but the sound of your breath

I've also noticed just how entertainment-dependent we've become. People take their smartphones into the washroom and use them during dinner! When was the last time you ate a meal and sat in quiet? 


Now I know many of you might say that entertainment isn't harmful in moderation

The real problem with this philosophy though, of distraction, will be different. 

The only way you can discover the amount that is right for you is to remove all of it

We are all horders of not things

Continue pushing past our comfort and reducing the amount of entertainment we have

That is what I am advocating. Not a complete removal

Just some words of advice when you're thinking about redoing a room!  I'm by no means an interior decorator, fill that space and you will have, strangely enough, a more filled out and spacious room.

But for the past 6 years, because it's too much. I have terabytes worth of stuff that needs organising and that I'll *one day attend to*. I am also a writer and I find ideas very precious, so I have millions of ideas that I've accumulated over the years that I write down in little text documents that I'll one day find use for - that I'll *one day* write a story with. I have music that I don't even listen to anymore that I need to organise, pictures I saved, gazillions of bookmarks on each of my browsers that I'll one day research and read about, and so on. The burden of needing to get it all sorted makes me anxious every time I think about it, but I never even *thought* about deleting all of it up until this point. I never realised how inextricably attached I am to my virtual possessions that have accumulated and how much it clutters up my mind. Yet in the past few years, adding more and more bookmarks that I'll never really get around to reading.

I'm no expert, on what you need right now.** I think the allure of nearly endless space that comes with virtual possessions can delude us into thinking we need things when we really don't. Minimalise your virtual space to what your current needs are and be very meticulous about what you keep for your future needs 'just in case'. Don't lie to yourself - will you really truly need it or are you just attached to all the time and effort you put into it? Don't be scared of forgetting things: if you do forget, it really isn't that important. It's only life. If you need something again, you'll find it somehow, or you'll find a way around it.

**Get In The Mindset - Silly Things First!**

If you snap into cleaning all of your house of all of your excess stuff without doing anything beforehand, or dumping out all those used giftcards from your wallet. It starts to get you in the mindset of minimalism without doing too much work, and you'll be happy you did it later, because after you minimalize your living space, you'll be pretty exhausted.

When you're ready

**Step 1: Go to the store**

Now this might seem contradictory, you'll be needing them. If you don't have any non-ripping trash bags, make sure to snag some of those too.

**Step 2: Seize the (a) day!**

Pick a day where you know you don't have much planned. This is the day you'll dump out containers, etc. The next steps are a more detailed look.

**Step 3: Move and Clean**

Have you ever seen a minimalist's bedroom that wasn't clean? Didn't think so. Put all of your belongings in your living space in one corner, everything. Once you've done that, put all the furniture back, and clean all that off as well.

**Step 4: Empty**

Empty everything. Make 4 separate piles.

1.) Give away (useful

2.) Trash

3.) Sentimental (You don't have to throw away memories to be minimalist!!)

4.) Useful (or so you think)

Pack piles #1 and #2 in your car and go to the dump/good will. 

For #3, since usually that kind of stuff doesn't need to be lying in drawers or on counter tops. 

Remember those bins? For anything that isn't IMMEDIATELY useful (such as clothes you ALWAYS wear, so that it's accessible, but not *too* easy to get to. If you don't want to bother getting the item because it's not convenient, then you DON'T need it. 

After 3-6 months, if you have any furniture used for storage (cabinets, shelves) that aren't being used anymore since you don't have as much stuff, go ahead and get rid of those, too.

**Step 5: Keep At It**

This is where things usually fall apart for most people. You know that habit you have of throwing those CD's in your desk, you'll end up being right back where you started. 

And that's pretty much it! Comment if I left anything out.

Over the course of the last 6 months

If I were to pack up to move tomorrow

But I noticed in the past couple of months that my digital life was a little too cluttered.  I had apps everywhere on my tablet and smartphone and my laptop was a clutter of things going ""TAKE CARE OF ME NOW."" I was constantly checking my phone for those badges of numbers that I needed to take care of. My tablet was a plethora of things going ""READ ME, I didn't control my devices.

[So I minimalized everything digitally.](http://imgur.com/a/cX4m9)

**Tablet: iPad**

 * Only my most essential apps on the dock. Everything else is put into folders that are organized by function on a different page

 * [GoodReader](http://www.goodiware.com/goodreader.html): for all my documents and annotations.  I am a science graduate student and so I use GoodReader/Dropbox to handle all of my papers to read

 * [Agenda](http://savvyapps.com/agenda/): easy

 * Pages: to type up documents and notes and keep my lab log on.

 * [Bamboo Paper](http://www.wacom.com/en/products/software/bamboo-paper): when I need pen and paper. Digitally of course.

 * [forScore](http://www.forscoreapp.com): I also use my iPad as my sheet music library.  I play piano to accompany for dance classes in my city's ballet company. Being able to carry around all my music on a single device is fantastic.

 * [Musicnotes](http://www.musicnotes.com/ipad/): to hold the sheet music I purchase for my band when we practice.

**Smartphone: iPhone** I got the iPad first for school. So when it came time for a smartphone
 
* [Dialvetica](http://mysterioustrousers.com/dialvetica): a great minimal ""get to the contact you need to contact"" app whether it is to email

* [Agenda](http://savvyapps.com/agenda/): same as on the iPad.

* Settings: to change things like bluetooth and whatnot.

* On my iPad and iPhone

**Laptop: 15"" Macbook Pro**

 * I got rid of my dock.  It was too distracting and took up screen real estate.  Hiding it still bothered me since if my cursor touched an edge

 * [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com): one of the best apps for OSX out there.  You gain incredible efficiency through this app. I use it for everything from launching to quitting apps.  To emptying my trash can. To google searching. Very powerful.

 * [Bartender](http://www.macbartender.com): to clear my menubar and keep things from distracting me.

 * Lastly

Since I dedicated myself to this setup for my devices, I need to check my email now"" or ""I need to text this person"" or ""It is time for me to check Facebook."" This way I am in control, and not the other way around.

And because of this new mental route

So that's my journey through Digital Minimalism. Thought I'd share with you guys! I love this community and the clarity Minimalism (both in lifestyle and artistic design) have brought me.

**Sell**

I will never forget the feeling of getting to safety, to a fault - I used to live amidst constant clutter because I was so loathed to deal with the sheer volume of *things* I had to contend with. All that, gone in a heartbeat.

It was incredible how little I cared. In a moment like that, your birth certificate, your debit card... those are the only things that matter. You're watching your home go up in flames, the 5 different kinds of shampoo you had in the bathroom or your excessive collection of scarves just don't matter. 

The offers for clothing, travel-sized toiletries... they were overwhelming. I outfitted myself with a backpack with 3 days worth of clothes and the little baggie the Red Cross gave me of soap and toothbrushes, and handling any more *things* was anxiety-provoking. I only wanted enough that I could keep track of everything all at once. Later that day I went back with my family and tried to salvage what I could - my room was relatively undamaged, but it's hard to think of what to grab when you only have 10 minutes to do it - my mother's constant prompts of ""are you sure you don't want this? we can always fix it"" just wore me out. I didn't want anything. I grabbed my teddy bear from when I was a baby, some clothes, my grandmother's diamond earrings, and some useful knick knacks I'd picked up on various travels. I can fit most everything I own in a car but I have no idea what to do with it. It's just stuff. Stuff without a home is pointless.

I signed a lease on a beautiful new apartment and I'll be filling it with furniture and stuff in the near future. Thankfully renter's insurance will cover everything. Starting over with little to nothing is actually quite nice.

I've thought a lot about minimalism since this happened. By definition, well, the fire took care of that for me.

I keep reading these ""how to de-clutter your life"" blogs and it's almost nauseating how little they apply. Where are the ""I just lost everything and want to rebuild my life around the notion that I don't want or need much"" blogs? The anxiety I have over accumulating unnecessary things is almost prohibitive.

You'll probably see a lot more of me on here. To be frank

Thanks for listening.

&gt;Why would anybody want to live like that? That's not minimalism at all. It's just sad. Do you never have friends or family over?

&gt;I don't get it. I understand minimalism in a pragmatic way, but this is not about that anymore. This is about less stuff for its own sake.


----

So what is going on in this subreddit? Nowhere else on the internet dedicated to minimalists have I seen so many people who are not minimalists.

Everyone will have a different level of ""stuff"" they feel they need. And this means some homes will be more furnished than others.

But you should applaud the people who have managed to live with very little

I think the problem with this subreddit is that it is not dedicated to people who practice minimalism as a lifestyle. 

We have:

1. The people who like minimal aesthetics / art. (But want to keep all their stuff / live with clutter.)
2. The home-maker moms who are trying to 'live simply'
3. The people who want more money and more time
4. Those who like to be self-sufficient

To be a minimalist in your lifestyle

There is a drive many minimalists share


----

TL;DR:

**If you cannot understand that having less makes people happy and gives them a sense of freedom

**If minimalism and de-cluttering has brought you happiness

Finally

And then you become attached to that list, you create a list of stuff you own, and that list defines you, owns you.

**tl;dr: Isn't a list of the objects you have

1359152989.0,17a6a1,Counting is the wrong way to think about minimalism.,JackParrish,83,10,9,"Not trying to be unkind to counters

So to encourage those new to minimalism: counting is the wrong way to think about it. 

It's not that counting isn't useful. I really can be a good place to start, just another way to be obsessed with things. 

So here's a few good rules of thumb to help: 

**Take everything that you do not find to be beautiful or useful and remove it from your space.** This probably won't get you all the way there right away, you'll be more than 1/2 way there. 

**Get rid of what you can immediately, and some cleverness on your part. It's okay to give it that time, because it's not about THINGS, it's about you, your life, and your space. And you have a context. 

**Counting is an interesting place to start--to take inventory. And it's a good way to end/update/evaluate. But don't use counting to try and make your life work.** This is where the ""100 things"" approach becomes pretty twisted and can go all wrong. 

Should we count all toilet paper rolls individually or as a group? What if I office out of my home and I need stamps and cables? 

Why should my amount of toilet paper affect my stamps? If I allow myself a pair of shoes

And if I need a watch for my life does that mean I can't have my spare set of eye glasses do I need to lose my cooking flour? 

And around and around it goes

**Minimalism isn't about a number.** It's about removing from your space what you do not need, we never use it, and we don't even care about it. 

For some people, and different things help them to live that life and make those contributions. 

Do you read? Do you cook? Do you smoke cigars? Do you write? Do you work from home? Are you an architect? Construction? Minimalism can make your life simpler and better if you do all or any of these things

I love to rock climb and camp. So I have a very simple set of gear for these activities, and out of my mind. When I need them, I use them. And if I cease to do these things, I'll sell the gear or give it away. 

**Don't go so far that your life becomes much more ""plastic"" or expensive just because of your minimalism.** This is a twisted thing that happens to some folks. I had a good friend who paired down

His kitchen was no longer useful. And it was a wickedly unhealthy choice for him

Or the guy who runs his company and got rid of everything before he had systems to replace them (he wasn't clever). So he ended up buying and throwing away paperclips every time he needed them

The fact is, and you must be clever when you cut along the important boundaries. Go paperless? Hell yes! But make sure you have a system to still track your important documents or else you'll find yourself sued by clients or the IRS. 

**And this wraps into the final rule of thumb: minimalism should make you BETTER at what you do, not force you to leech off of everyone else's space or things. Be vibrant and wise and self sufficient--just with only a minimal amount of things to BE these things.  

This isn't an excuse to hoard and keep from pairing things down. Far from it. It's just that, not about an obsession with things (just doing it from the other direction). This causes a lot of people trouble, and forces them to end up spending a lot more money and worrying about things after they minimize every bit as much as they did before. 

It's not a thoughtless undertaking. In fact

Good luck. ",,t5_2r0z9,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/17a6a1/counting_is_the_wrong_way_to_think_about/

If you're anything like me

I took the popular enclaves such as pics and funny for necessities, I got to thinking of how little I truly cared about what went on there, and realized that I could easily remove myself from them. So I went to my subreddit listed and purged. Slowly, it began to dwindle. With time, more and more subreddits wouldn't make the cut. After a while, I reached a satisfactory number, which is where I am today. 

This is [my front page](http://i.imgur.com/qhAqo.png)

* Compressed view means I have no thumbnail to draw my eyes

* I'm removed from a lot of the 'essential' subreddits

* Only 10 posts per page, I don't want a more seamless reddit experience, I want a simple one. 

The brain is more fragile and impressionable than we understand. It’s not just the amount of furniture we surround ourselves by, but in this subreddit, on thinking about reddit and by extension, the internet in a different way – through minimalism. Do I need this? Or is it a waste of my time? Just because it isn't physical doesn't mean it doesn't affect us in significant and equal ways to physical things.

Over the last year, more and more things went out the door as I was able to break my chains with them. Many expensive items that I held onto with white knuckles for a long time. Tonight I actually put my television on craigslist and am willing to accept an offer at probably less than what I could get for it if I really tried. The reason being that it is unnecessary! I have never in my life been one to sit in front of a tv and watch. My girlfriend and I watch a movie maybe once a week. Not enough to justify having this thing sitting around. I'm actually looking forward to getting it out of here and freeing up the space. 
I've discovered many things after getting rid of time wasters. I've taken up shooting and greatly enjoy it. I've found that I have more money to put into my motorcycle which is a passion of mine. I've begun to read books for the first time since high school. 
I feel bad for those out there who are still mentally chained to their possessions. I could now fit everything I own into one pickup truck bed and it's a great feeling. I've not felt a greater sense of peace and well being in my life.

EDIT: Allow me to clarify something for those who don't seem to be getting what I'm saying. This is not something that I started with by saying or thinking ""I want to be a minimalist lolz!"". This is something that I started long ago when I found that I like things simple and clean. I had never even heard of ""minimalism"" until I made a reddit account about a year ago and found this subreddit.  I don't believe that anyone can become a ""minimalist"" by actively practicing it or taking other people's advice. This is something that is grown into and is more of an awakening (if you will) than anything. I'm not getting rid of possessions in order to make myself happy. I'm simply finding that as I get rid of things I am becoming naturally more happy. That is what this post is about. Not preaching to anyone, get rid of or throw away. I don't care what others do. What your house and living space looks like is your business. I am sharing my experiences, so please keep your slanted naysaying drivel in another thread if you were considering posting it.

One of the over-riding themes in this sub-reddit is the removal of extraneous material for a clearer and more concise lifestyle. The impact on world-view is also discussed.

In some ways I look at minimalism as a creative lifestyle challenge: it forces you to do what you did before, but that's their journey).

This is just a thought for those who struggle to find the right balance: sometimes it's about perspective. You're not removing options from your life

**The American Tourist and Mexican Fisherman**

An American tourist was at the pier of a small coastal Mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked.

Inside the small boat were several large yellowfin tuna. The tourist complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them.

The Mexican replied

The tourist then asked

The Mexican said

The tourist then asked

The Mexican fisherman said, play with my children, take siesta with my wife, Maria, stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos, I have a full and busy life.""

The tourist scoffed, processing and distribution. You could leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then Los Angeles and eventually New York where you could run your ever-expanding enterprise.""

The Mexican fisherman asked

The tourist replied

""But what then?"" asked the Mexican.

The tourist laughed and said

""Millions?...Then what?""

While it is sometimes hard to explain my minimalism to my consumerist peers, but just a general openness about my lifestyle that informs others that there is another way, and that it is liberating and fulfilling. I enjoy my modest life, and would love it to be more socially acceptable (for young women especially) to adopt a simple lifestyle. Most people I meet assume that because I am a female 20-something, I spend a load of time at the mall, or that I have a 40+ pair shoe collection, or that my idea of a good time is picking out useless pieces of shitty decor to cram into some over-sized apartment somewhere. In reality

I hope that other women will also step out of their (nearly-empty and well organized) closets and be open about their minimalism in the near future. Maybe together we can break the stigma of wearing the same dress to two different formal events in the same year (I only have one, or making art, or reading inspiring works.

One day I looked around and discovered to my horror that despite having moved across the US just two years ago with only the things I could carry on a plane

The move could have been traumatic for a number of reasons, and identifying those things that I really could not live without.

As many others have said

With about a month left until departure

As for the rest of my STUFF, the freedom I so desired, and examining the steps necessary to make that happen. Making lists is very important here.

And I'm finally here in Managua! Time and time again you hear people say that they don't miss any of the stuff they left behind. Well I'm telling you it again because it's true! The freedom I feel in being able to fit everything I own in a backpack/dufflebag is unlike any I had while living a domestic life in the states. I'm currently staying with a friend

**What I brought with me:** [(a picture)](http://i.imgur.com/5TXKg.jpg)

* Nikon D7000 DSLR camera (thinking about selling this as it is very large and cumbersome)
* 13"" Macbook Pro (now wishing I had bought a MB Air instead)
* 1 TB external harddrive (size of my wallet)
* 10 books (still far too many IMO)
* 1 set of hair/beard clippers
* 4 pairs of shoes (again, 1 basketball, sandals)
* 2 sweaters/sweatshirts
* 2 long button up shirts (white/black)
* 2 long pants
* 4 shorts (dark, comfy)
* 7 tshirts (probably still too many)
* 1 undershirt
* 5 underwear
* 5 pairs of socks

**I actually had about 40-50% more clothes than this about a half hour ago. In creating this thread and taking stock I realized I still had huge excesses - so my things have been pared down once again. Perfect example of why you should take stock (or literally make a list) of your stuff and figure out just what you need!**

**A few lessons this ordeal has taught me:**

* I didn't actually NEED even a fraction of the things I owned
* The biggest reason we accumulate things is the PERCEIVED sense of security they bring us. This thing that starts out as security breeds a little monster called complacency. For me
* These events which are cleverly disguised as adversity are actually OPPORTUNITY for personal growth. When faced with a situation you've never encountered and left to your own devices
* Stop letting fear/anxiety dictate your actions. Fear of moving to another country. Fear of getting rid of ""things"". Fear of certain social situations.
* PUSH THE ENVELOPE.  It's all the same. (Generally)
* Don't skimp on quality. You'll regret it later when you have to replace that thing you got at WalMart for that great Chinese-manufactured price (obv. there are exceptions).
* You don't need the absolute biggest, lightest, most beautiful of EVERYTHING. It took me a month to figure out which laptop to buy because I just HAD to know which model best suited some bs list of my predetermined ""needs"". I wasn't satisfied with the stock Macbook, but instead installed extra RAM and a new SSD hard drive. All told, I spent over $1400!! In the end I'm left wishing I had the less powerful and smaller Macbook Air! (I know it's a wonderful device and I really do love my computer, what I'm attempting to say is despite all of the research and fretting about every technical specification to ensure my computer was absolutely state of the art, I managed to overlook the most important detail
* RENT FURNISHED. I can't tell you untold hundreds of dollars worth of stuff (furniture, and you get my drift.
*Don't stop at decluttering just material things! When I purchased my new computer and had to transfer everything from the old one, random outdated documents, you name it. In all I decided I didn't need maybe 100GB worth of stuff. Strangely, this was more gratifying than almost any other part of this whole process.

Parting notes: If myself and countless other people can do this, from Nicaragua! Or eh.. adios!

1365709968.0,1c5mq0,Backpacking Introduced me to Minimalism,efdelcam,63,4,20,"I’ve always gone camping with my family since I was a kid
When I moved to College I was very interested in going fairly light. At the time I was obsessed with the movie “Into the Wild” and I had ideals of hitchhiking and travelling with a backpack, only about 4 pairs of jeans.  Some shorts, maybe 12 shirts, tons of crappy cotton underwear and socks that needed constant replacing.  I had a houseplant, which I still like having, to help with air quality. And A guitar, skateboard, all of which I never used.  

By the end of my freshman year I was moving into DNR housing for a summer job in Wisconsin, less knickknacks, I got rid of my posters. After my summer job I had a lot of extra spending money. Of course I blew about half of this on clothes, I bought nail polish in about 10 colors, a studded belt, more jeans, a leather coat, a stand up paddle board, died it black
When I started dating my boyfriend we were talking about moving into a tent for the summer and living that way indefinitely.  We packed everything we owned into my car. We sold our bikes, they are quick drying so I can wash them in a sink and hang them  dry. I will never use cotton underwear again. And we departed for our adventure in Flagstaff AZ. He worked for an environmental firm during the day and I did various odd jobs to make some money.  At night we slept in a tent in the national forest.  By the end of the summer we had saved enough money to buy our Van. This is by far the best purchase we have ever made together. It cost us $3,800 and we’ve lived in it, used it to travel, and used to for a delivery job.  We bought a mattress, built a frame, and moved into the van. If felt like luxury after living in the tent for two months. 

At the end of the summer we went on a backpacking trip at Sequoia National Park. We ended up taking a lot of heavy and unnecessary stuff. Chaz brought a knife that weighed about 2 lbs

Our next trip a few weeks later was in Yellowstone.  We had both bought new lighter-weight packs and sold our old packs. We used bivy sacks this time with a thin sleeping-bag liner instead of a tent and sleeping bag. It was too light

Our next trip was an epic two-month adventure in Australia and New Zealand.  We did a stellar job packing this time. We had a lighter weight tent. Light packs and sleeping pads, 2 bras, 1 quick dry t-shirt, 1 sun shirt, 1 pair of shoes, 1 pair of ultralight sandals, 3 pairs of socks, rain jacket, although I liked knowing it was there if we needed it. We also brought a Jetboil camp stove and mugs for eating out of. I ended up getting rid of my cup since I never used it. We hardly used the Jetboil because it took us about half the trip before we found fuel for it. But we did cook a lot of ramen in it in the last few weeks. We took along our netbook, communication

The most recent trip we have taken we went to Puerto Rico for 18 days. This was our lightest trip yet. We had a base pack weight of about 9lbs. Our sleeping bags proved to be useless since it was so hot. And our Jetboil was also useless since you cannot buy fuel for it anywhere in PR.  I can’t say that PR was our favorite trip but it was very inexpensive. We were able to camp most nights and met a lot of locals who gave us rides and told us what we should see. 

Packing and living out of a bag for weeks on end is such a great experience. I love the mobility and self sufficiency. We are able to just walk and if we get somewhere nice camp there. I don’t want to go total vagabond and live like that permanently. But I like taking long trips that way. Our next trip is going to be a cross country bicycle tour from Michigan to Vancouver this summer.  Packing light has taught me to eliminate the unnecessary in my everyday life as well. I used to have a thick bulky Volcom Stone wallet that couldn’t fit in my pocket. Now I use a slim wallet. I used to have decorative key chains

What little money Erdos received in stipends or lecture fees he gave away to relatives, and strangers. He could not pass a homeless person without giving him money. ""In the early 1960s, when I was a student at University College London,"" recalled D. G. Larman, ""Erdos came to visit us for a year. After collecting his first month's salary he was accosted by a beggar on Euston station, asking for the price of a cup of tea. Erdos removed a small amount from the pay packet to cover his own frugal needs and gave the remainder to the beggar."" In 1984 he won the prestigious Wolf Prize, the most lucrative award in mathematics. He contributed most of the $50,"" Erdos said,"" said Graham

In the late 1980s Erdos heard of a promising high school student named Glen Whitney who wanted to study mathematics at Harvard but was a little short of the tuition. Erdos arranged to see him and,000. He asked Whitney to pay him back only when it would not cause financial strain. A decade later Graham heard from Whitney, who at last had the money to repay Erdos. ""Did Erdos expect me to pay interest?"" Whitney wondered. ""What should I do?"" he asked Graham. Graham talked to Erdos. ""Tell him,"" Erdos said, ""to do with the thousand dollars what I did.""

It is based on the idea of a story written by Ernest Hemmingway. It reads:

""For sale: baby shoes

Hemmingway later said it was one of his best works.

I think the idea of condensing a story down to six words forces a writer to strip away all the unimportant words until there is just the pure idea nugget left.

And so I've challenged myself to write a six word story for each genre. I'd like to share them with you.

Here is an example. Science fiction genre:

""Scientists discover immortality. Payment plans available.""

What I've noticed

This may be partially or primarily just a function of my psychology: I have a tendency to be a perfectionist, my focus is often about monitoring what I own or purchase and making sure I'm continuing to be minimalist.

For example, so I'll spend tons of time trying to find that perfect pair, because I really don't want to own more than one. But in doing this, I'm just spending a lot of time focusing on Stuff, which is antithetical to the goals of minimalism, at least to a certain degree.

1343405201.0,x93iz,The fetishism of stuff,rimcrimp,68,16,18,"Hey r/minimlism. This is my first post here. I'm not quite a minimalist

Anyway, and then there's just junk. This idea that people frequently go to malls or other stores to go 'shopping' is starting to sicken me. There's a difference between going to the store to buy something you need and 'shopping' trips where people go to stores not even with anything particular in mind. They just go to peruse and buy junk that catches their eye. They probably didn't even think they 'needed' it before they saw it in the store. This upsets me.

The other day I was watching Pawn Stars and it dawned on me how ridiculous the idea of collector's items being valuable is. People are affixing these insane and completely unjustified values to items because they once belonged to a certain person or perhaps only a few of them were made. These people quite literally enjoy just having stuff for the sake of having it. Many serious collectors have collections of mint items that they'll never even use, but it makes me wonder what sort of society we live in where a collected might drop $1000 on some random piece of junk that is completely non-functional (because it would devalue the item to use it) while in other parts of their own country people are surely starving (or other parts of the world people are dying).

Then there's a newspaper ad I saw the other day. It was for some store and it had a big section called ""DOORBUSTERS"" as in 'these deals are so good you'll come bust down the door the moment the store opens'. The items they were advertising just made me think 'who the hell needs that stuff' and 'what idiot actually thinks these are worthy of the term 'doorbusters''? This brought back memories of a Walmart employee that was actually trampled to death a few years back (http://nyti.ms/shJqF6) because a junk-hungry mob stampeded through the doors as soon as the store opened so they could get the deals.

How is something like that not a wake-up call that we've let the fetishism of stuff get completely out of control? Someone actually died for no reason other than a bunch of people wanted a good deal on some shit that's probably been thrown out by now. This is genuinely disgusting.

In fact, slacks). In fact, I'm wondering how to get rid of the last few things I didn't take with me. Next time, I want to take just one small (30 L) backpack.

If I needed something like toiletries, I spent way less money ""traveling"" than I ever did ""at home"" even though I was in some of the most expensive places in the world (e.g., Tokyo and Hong Kong). I learned to be happy living in Asian shoe box-sized apartments, some less than 300 sq ft.

This trip has solidified my belief that minimalism is a precursor to happiness; none of this would be possible (for me anyway) without adopting minimalist beliefs. If you cannot learn to be happy with a little

I hope everyone in this subreddit can get the feeling of true freedom and satisfaction from minimalism one way or another at some point. Owning physical things actually makes me unhappy now as I feel burdened and restricted by them. Only people, and I have more than enough resources to obtain those.

I was studying for an exam and was reminded of this concept that might be of interest to you - the 5Ss. 

1. Sort/segregate - Keep what is needed &amp; remove everything else; when in doubt

2. Simplify/straighten - Arrange environment to improve work flow and reduce wasted motion. Consider long-run &amp; short-run ergonomic issues. 

3. Shine/sweep - Clean daily; eliminate all forms of dirt

4. Standardize - Remove variations by developing standard operations/activities; this promotes cost reduction and increased efficiency. 

5. Sustain/self-discipline - Review periodically to recognize efforts and to motivate to sustain progress.

**General purpose questions and definitions**

**Q:** What is minimalism?

A word that means

**Q:** Are there requirements to be a ""minimalist?""

There aren't any requirements

**Q:** How do I make it work for my life?

Find what makes your life worth living and focus on that

**Q:** What kinds of minimalism are there?

* Reducing your possessions
* Removing your commitments and managing your time
* Downsizing your technology
* Focusing your mind
* Reducing visual elements
* And infinitely more. Look below for tips on how to achieve some of these.

**Q:** What is the point of minimalism?

To reconsider what we think is important to us, enhance, highlight. To enlighten. To be content with our lives.

**Q:** What about the [100 Things Challenge](http://guynameddave.com/about-the-100-thing-challenge/)? What about those guys who [own 15 things](http://andrewhy.de/extreme-minimalism/)? Is minimalism supposed to be followed like [Leo Babauta](http://mnmlist.com/)

It can be. Those are examples of ways to apply minimalism to your life. However

**Advice and tips for common questions**

**Q:** Where do I start if I want material minimalism?

It doesn't matter where you start

Donate as much as you can, clothes, bathroom items, the junk drawer, the storage attic, and so on. Don't be too scared of throwing away too much or making mistakes. If you're not sure if you can live without something, loan it to a friend or put it in the closet for a period of time.

**Q:** How do I maintain a state of material minimalism?

If you're continually having to purge, and stop your buying impulses. Don't let your garbage can do your minimalism for you. 

Implement a ""one in, or is it just a minor want? To help with wants, only allow yourself to buy things after they've been on a ""I want this"" list for a month.

**Q:** Can I still have hobbies if I'm material minimalist? What about hobbies that require a lot of stuff?

Of course to both. However

**Q:** Can [blank] be considered minimalist?

With any number of viewpoints

**Q:** Where do I start if I want mental minimalism?

Important: If you suspect you or a someone you know has depression or suicidal thoughts

That said, both for your activities and your relaxation. Consider professional help if you feel like you need extra mental guidance, and always practice safe techniques.

**Q:** Where do I start if I want to manage my time better?

Learn to say no to things that aren't worth your attention. Make to-do lists and break down what needs to happen in to extremely small chunks. Analyze what ""needs"" to be done versus what doesn't. See how mental minimalism can help you accomplish more things by sharpening your mind.

**Q:** Where do I start if I want digital minimalism?

Smaller ideas: Delete the programs that you aren't using, movie, and book collections and decide if you want to digitize them. 

Bigger ideas: Switching to a different operating system is a big step for some, make sure you're fully educated on the changes, be fully realistic of the benefits and don't do it lightly.

**Q:** What should I do about living with my parents who aren't minimalist?

Rephrasing your goals can help communicate what you want, so don't stress out about it.

**Q:** What should I do about living with my significant other/roommate/friend who isn't minimalist?

We don't know what it's like to be you in your situation, because it rarely works.

1339496877.0,uxql6,Tip: Buy stuff and have less stuff!,,69,15,28,"Hi
Just wanted to share a good tip on buying things as a minimalist.
It really works for me and it's a great way to further reduce clutter.

Steps:

1. Identify.
Find the thing you really need. Let's take an example: A new phone. Why do you need one? (List at least 5 sensible advantages (not just 'bigger screen')). Which one is the best? (not only for the price. Remember - a greedy man pays twice the price. ALWAYS purchase quality items). Whoa! That's really expensive! Do I really need it? (list 5 ways it will improve your life. Decide and choose.

2. Wait.
You probably already do this on a daily basis. Put the object on 'hold'. Wait two weeks before buying the product. That way you'll avoid the 'want' factor and really consider the items necessity. 

3. Sell. 
This is the crucial bit. Find two other objects in your house and sell them for at least half the price of the new product that you want to purchase. That way

If you use this simple scheme to make your purchases you'll end up having only top quality

Hope this helps,False,,t5_2r0z9,False,,,t3_uxql6

1360314129.0,184gd5,Need tips for drastic downsize in prep for overseas move,ljushjart,62,10,64,"I'm moving overseas this summer (to Sweden from US).  I'm thinking I'd like to take this opportunity to downsize drastically.  I would love some general tips and strategies for this.   I also have some specific ideas/questions.

- A main general struggle I have always had is worrying that I will get rid of something I need.  I'm not a wealthy person.  So having to re-purchase something that I get rid of is a big anxiety.  However I need to remember I can re-buy for probably close to same cost as ocean freight shipping of anything.

- Mementos and Pictures.  I'm going to try to whittle this down to just one box.  I'm thinking of possibly taking photos of items as way to remember them. Scanning paper items and photos.  It will be tough though and time consuming to do this.   Is this a difficult area for most people? 

- Clothes.  I've been losing weight after putting on quite a bit in recent years.  I have clothes of several different sizes.   I'd love to get rid of all the big ones and keep the super small ones that don't fit yet.   But wonder if I should only keep ones that fit right now.   However clothes are expensive in Sweden compare to here

- Books.  This one is hard as I don't think I will have as easy access to books written in English.  And books in general are also more expensive in Sweden.   However books are heavy of course and expensive to ship.

**TL;DR**  Moving overseas in a few months.   I'm new to minimalism

I realize this isn't /r/personalfinance but for me these changes weren't about money. They were about having ""enough"" instead of getting my hands on everything I could afford. I think the concept of ""enough"" is very skewed in North America

I've been lurking here for the past year or so

**Regarding Posessions:**
I started selling stuff. Books, DVDs, clothes. Then giving away the stuff I couldn't sell. A library's worth of movies I didn't watch, shelves of books I had already read, and CDs/records that I didn't listen to (and hadn't in years). I didn't need it and I didn't want it. Donations to the local thrift store became a regular occurrence. Plus I made hundreds of dollars from stuff I didn't want and it all found a new home.

**Regarding Design and Aesthetics:**
I'm a structural engineer, especially the work of Tadao Ando and John Pawson. After reading Sarah Susanka's [Not So Big House](http://www.amazon.com/Not-So-Big-House-Susanka/dp/B003F76K0E) I decided that my grand plan will likely include the design and construction of my own home (by which I mean I will be architect, designer, engineer, construction supervisor and primary laborer). This home will not be a McMansion, it will be more like a 1000 square foot single bedroom home with an open concept living space. It also may not happen for another 10-20 years, but it's something to work towards.
I guess I can also mention here that I did a purge of my computer

**Regarding Money and Consumption**
For me, and liked what I saw. I started with [Your Money or Your Life](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=your+money+or+your+life) and went from there. My mentor has been [Mr. Money Mustache] (http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/). I read his entire blog (the equivalent of about a 700 page book) in a week. I highly recommend it. Jacob Lund Fisker at [Early Retirement Extreme](http://earlyretirementextreme.com/) has been another motivator. These guys not only taught me that minimalism could reduce my consumption, it could also free me from the financial constraints of paid work. They also gave me a clear guide of how to reach my goals. By no means do I plan to ""retire"" in the conventional sense, but it looks to me that I should be able to save enough to remove the *obligation* of paid work from my life before age 35.

I'm going of for my freshman year of college in September and thought this would be a great thing to have me save some space here and at my dorm. So I started going through my closet

I had piles of books, video games, etc. that was ready to be donated, sold or trashed when my Dad comes in. He asks me what I was doing with all this stuff. I told him about my plan of reducing the amount of stuff I own and just keeping what I need. My Dad is a man of holding onto things for dear life. Nothing towards the level of hoarding, but he keeps all of his papers or anything he thinks there is a possibility of needing in the future. So this was probably a big shock to him.

He started going through everything I was getting rid of and asking me why I don't want to keep it in case I needed it (ex. old board games, and clothing passed down from my brothers). He was angry that I would just do this without thinking about it and told me to put the stuff back. I put my donate and selling things back but got rid of the things I was throwing out yesterday while he was out.

He reacted in a similar way when I told him I was an atheist. Just not able to understand the change in my lifestyle and rejecting it. So this is nothing new

I just wanted to air this out and see if anyone else had this problem with people in their family where they simply don't understand why you would do this.

And I still want to thank you all for giving me a new perspective on things and this will definitely not be the end of my journey. I hope this ideology will carry over to my spending where I will begin to really consider what I am buying and how I will be using it in a week/month/year from then and whether or not it's worth it. (Case in point was two months ago where I saw this awesome Lego Naboo Starfighter at Toys R' Us and I though ""I should totally buy this because I didn't get to when I was a kid and I always wanted to"". Then I thought that 4 days from now it would be on my shelf with no use out of it besides the initial buliding of it. So I opted out and put the cash in the bank.)
