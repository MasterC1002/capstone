1352299644.0,12sr0a,I encourage you to shrug.  I did it &amp; so can you.,Darko_the_Engineer,96,26,75,"I'm not certain of the demographics of reddit users, and have skills that are economically viable.  You're probably making good money too.

Shrugging is going to vary from person to person. I'm going to talk a bit about the method that worked for me

While I'm not aware of any actual gulches one can relocate to,000 a year) of your income earned from a foreign corporation is not taxable.    

There are people working to make gulch like cities in Honduras, Panama now offers residency to any business person who chooses to live there (and after 5-10 years you can get citizenship).   Their tax structure is straightforward, and they respect property rights, etc.  There are at least a half dozen possibilities, and actually once you get outside the USA and start looking you find more and more.

I think the main thing stopping people from shrugging is the high hurdle of inertia. 

Here's what you need to do it: 

1. Skills that are marketable.  Ideally skills that can be sold online. (Eg: you make software, or entrepreneur, etc.) 

2. A good current job to save up $20-40k

3. The conviction to do it (Eg: a willingness to live frugally until you get the capital saved up

There are also three phases:

1. Build up your skills and your savings

2. Build up a business on the side while working (if you can) or work out the right business, there is no Amazon.com in central and south america.  These are countries that are RIPE for such a business.  Whatever your area of expertise you can find that there are opportunities out there, possibly where there's even less competition in america.   One of the things that America has that other countries don't is a culture of entrepreneurism.  So, even though a country might have solid property rights and a low tax structure (like Panama) there is still huge opportunity simply because locals don't think ""I want to start my own company!"" -- they don't want to take the risk.  (And I'm just picking panama as an example, this is true in europe, central and south america as well, and probably other places I've never been.)

3. Shrug.  That's it.  Go.  Go pursue your life and your business and see the world while your at it.  One of the best possibilities is to be a perpetual tourist.  Countries treat tourists well

But don't stay stuck in an Urban hell in america

I once was in central alaska, at a gas station, one of the few for hundreds of miles, and was so happy to get gas-- I'd gotten desperate.  Across from me was an RV with New York plates, and they got out and all they did was bitch and moan about the price of gas. (It was $1.60 a gallon when back in the lower 48 it was usually around $1.30 a gallon... so the price wasn't even that outrageous.) 

We were both in paradise

You can remove your support of the beast.   Sure, it would be much better to pay that government, which isn't exactly going to be projecting a military force across the world, or paving the way for global socialism-- than to pay the same money to a beast in a position to do more damage to your life and the lives of those you care about. 

Galt's Gulch is where you make it!

One of the ways critics try to dismiss Ayn Rand and the entire free market position more broadly

It’s a bizarre characterization. Rand, the pro-capitalist view regards government as a necessary good.

The key issue is: what kind of government? The capitalist position recognizes that some governments aren’t good. When government stops protecting its citizens and starts seizing their wealth and taking away their freedom

The critics paint free market thinkers as anti-government because of the kind of government they, rights-violating regulatory-welfare state. But equating “anti-statism” with “anti-state” is like saying that a person is anti-computer because he’s against using them to hack into people’s bank accounts.

If Ayn Rand was anti-state because she opposed rights-violating governments, like her, believed that government’s function was crucial but strictly limited. In Jefferson’s immortal words,

    a wise and frugal Government, and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned.

1369579172.0,1f2yxy,The least popular but most chilling of Rand's character speeches - Toohey's confession to Keating.,mrhymer,33,4,15," ""What do you want Ellsworth ?""

""Power

""Whom...?""

""You. The world. It’s only a matter of discovering the lever. If you learn how to rule one single man’s soul, the soul. Not whips or swords or fire or guns. That’s why the Caesars, the attilas, the Napoleons were fools and did not last. We will. The soul, Peter, is that which can’t be ruled. It must be broken. Drive a wedge in, get your fingers on it – and the man is yours. You won’t need a whip – he’ll bring it to you and ask to be whipped. Set him in reverse – and his own mechanism will do your work for you. Use him against himself. Want to know how it’s done? See if I ever lied to you. See if you haven’t heard all this for years, and the fault is yours

There are many ways. Here’s one. Make man feel small. Make him feel guilty. Kill his aspiration and his integrity. That’s difficult. The worst among you gropes for an idol in his own twisted way. Kill integrity by internal corruption. Use it against himself. Direct it towards a goal destructive of all integrity. Preach selflessness. Tell man that altruism is the ideal. Not a single one has ever reached it and not a single one ever will. His every living instinct screams against it. But don’t you see what you accomplish ? Man realises that he’s incapable of what he’s accepted as the noblest virtue - and it gives him a sense of guilt, he gives up eventually all ideals, all aspiration, all sense of his personal value. He feels himself obliged to preach what he can’t practice. But one can’t be good halfway or honest approximately. To preserve one’s integrity is a hard battle. Why preserve that which one knows to be corrupt already? His soul gives up its self respect. You’ve got him. He’ll obey. He’ll be glad to obey – because he can’t trust himself, he feels uncertain, he feels unclean. That’s one way.

Here’s another. Kill man’s sense of values. Kill his capacity to recognise greatness or to achieve it. Great men can’t be ruled. We don’t want any great men. Don’t deny conception of greatness. Destroy it from within. The great is the rare, to the least, to the most inept – and you stop the impetus to effort in men, great or small. You stop all incentive to improvement, to excellence, to perfection. Laugh at Roark and hold Peter Keating as a great architect. You’ve destroyed architecture. Build Lois Cook and you’ve destroyed literature. Hail Ike and you’ve destroyed the theatre. Glorify Lancelot Clankey and you’ve destroyed the press. Don’t set out to raze all shrines – you’ll frighten men, Enshrine mediocrity - and the shrines are razed.

Then there’s another way. Kill by laughter. Laughter is an instrument of human joy. Learn to use it as a weapon of destruction. Turn it into a sneer. It’s simple. Tell them to laugh at everything. Tell them that a sense of humour is an unlimited virtue. Don't let anything remain sacred in a man’s soul – and his soul won’t be sacred to him. Kill reverence and you’ve killed the hero in man. One doesn’t reverence with a giggle. He’ll obey and he’ll set no limits to obedience – anything goes – nothing is too serious.

Here’s another way. This is most important. Don't allow men to be happy. Happiness is self-contained and self-sufficient. Happy men have no time and no use for you. Happy men are free men. So kill their joy in living. Take away from them what they want. Make them think that the mere thought of a personal desire is evil. Bring them to a state where saying ‘I want’ is no longer a natural right, for escape. Nature allows no vacuum. Empty man’s soul – and the space is yours to fill.

I don’t see why you should look so shocked, haven’t they all had a single leitmotif: sacrifice, renunciation, self-denial ? Haven’t you been able to catch their theme song – ‘Give up, give up, give up, give up’ ? Look at the moral atmosphere of today. Everything enjoyable, is considered depraved or sinful. Just prove that a thing makes men happy and you’ve damned it. That’s how far we’ve come. We’ve tied happiness to guilt. And we’ve got mankind by the throat.

Throw your first born into a sacrificial furnace – lie on a bed of nails – go into the desert to mortify the flesh – don’t dance – don't go to the movies on Sunday – don't try to get rich – don’t smoke – don’t drink. It’s all the same line. The great line. Fools don’t think that taboos of this nature are just nonsense. Something left over

Of course

Yet the test should be so simple: just listen to any prophet and if you hear him speak of sacrifice – run. Run faster than from a plague. It stands to reason that where there’s sacrifice, speaks of slaves and masters. And intends to be the master. But if you ever hear a man telling you that you must be happy, that it’s your natural right, that your first duty is to yourself – that will be the man who has nothing to gain from you. But let him come and you’ll scream your empty heads off, howling that he’s a selfish monster. So the racket is safe for many, many centuries.

But here you might have noticed something. I said, he must feel. He must believe. Suspend reason and you play it deuces wild. Anything goes in any manner you wish whenever you need it. You’ve got him. Can you rule a thinking man ? We don’t want any thinking men.""

Keating had sat down on the floor

""Peter

The world of the future. The world I want. A world of obedience and of unity. A world where the thought of each man will not be his own, around the globe. Since all must agree with all. A world where no man will hold a desire for himself, but will direct all his efforts to satisfy the desires of his neighbour who’ll have no desires except to satisfy the desires of the next neighbour, who’ll have no desires – around the globe, Peter. Since all must serve all. A world in which man will not work for so innocent an incentive as money, but for that headless monster – prestige. The approval of his fellows – their good opinion – the opinion of men who’ll be allowed to hold no opinion. An octopus, all tentacles and no brain.

Judgement, pumped by hand. My hand – and the hands of a few, a very few other men like me. Those who know what makes you tick – you great, wonderful average, you who have not risen in fury when we called you the average, the little, the common, you, the unlimited

Do you know the proper antonym for Ego ? Bromide

Can you see Howard Roark in this picture ? No ? Then don’t waste time on foolish questions. Everything that can’t be ruled, it will feel the pressure and it will explode. The pressure gauged to a vacuum. Do you know the fate of deep-sea creatures brought out to sunlight? So much for future Roarks. The rest of you will smile and obey. Have you noticed that the imbecile always smiles ? Man’s first frown is the first touch of God on his forehead. The touch of thought. But we’ll have neither God nor thought. Only voting by smiles. Automatic levers – all saying yes...

Now if you were a little more intelligent, Ellsworth Monkton Toohey ? And I’d say, Yes, you’re right. I’ll achieve no more than you will. I’ll have no purpose save to keep you contended. To lie, to flatter you, to praise you, to inflate your vanity. To make speeches about the people and the common good. Peter, I’m the most selfless man you’ve ever known. I have less independence than you

""Ellsworth... you’re...""

""Insane ? Afraid to say it ? There you sit and the world’s written all over you, to obey. To obey, to serve, to sacrifice. Divide and conquer – first. But then, unite and rule. We’ve discovered that one last. Remember the Roman Emperor who said he wished humanity had a single neck so he could cut it ? People have laughed at him for centuries. But we’ll have the last laugh. We’ve accomplished what he couldn’t accomplish. We’ve taught men to unite. This makes one neck ready for one leash. We found the magic word. Collectivism.

Look at Europe, the mass – as God. No motive and no virtue permitted – except that of service to the proletariat.

That’s one version. Here’s another. A country dedicated to the proposition that man has no rights, we push you in the other. We’ve fixed the coin. Heads – collectivism. Tails – collectivism. Give up your soul to a council – or give it up to a leader. But give it up, give it up, give it up. Offer poison as food and poison as antidote. Go fancy on the trimmings, but hang on to the main objective. Give the fools a chance, let them have their fun – but don’t forget the only purpose you have to accomplish. Kill the individual. Kill man’s soul. The rest will follow automatically.""

Ayn Rand was not a libertarian

http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=ar_libertarianism_qa

Note that she mentions that ""Galt's Gulch"" was not an example of Anarcho-Capitalism

I am not saying that everyone who posts about Anarcho-Capitalism is stupid (I was one myself for a brief period after I read ""For A New Liberty"", or that no one should post about it anywhere. I am merely saying that if this is a subreddit for ""Objectivism"" then the posts on here should mainly be about Objectivism, not something opposed to Objectivism. I wouldn't expect to see people posting on here often touting Kant and Plato, unless they simply wanted to encourage a debate, which is perfectly fine within limits. I am merely suggesting that the MAJORITY of the posts on here should have something to do with ACTUAL Objectivism, not a misconstrued version.

And not only that, I learned to look at other people that way too. That's one reason I started the ALT.NET group [educational group for programmers] -- because I believe that there is greatness in people, and those are the people I want to be around. Another thing her books emphasize is that people are ""traders"" -- that we give and take, and this trading is what allows many individuals to act in concert as a society. Its easy to understand this in terms of physical things -- I trade my labor for a paycheck, etc. Because Rand views people as heroic, realizing that by doing so

Here was our reasoning

* going into a theater (for example) without paying for a ticket is fraud
* you're also withholding your sanction from the people that make the movie you enjoy (as well as the theater that presents it for you)
* illegal downloading is **even worse** because you're withholding the same sanction PLUS you're actually *giving* your sanction to sites that steal the content (they make a killing on ad revenue)
* (it's like paying a hoodlum $3 to sneak you into the movie for free; you are allowing the hoodlum to profit at the expense of the people who are actually involved in the movie)

And here I went:

Wall of Text

I will say that the one danger of her philosophy is that it can easily be construed as narcissism. I am very arrogant by nature so I struggle with staying true to the objectivist philosophy. Perhaps the individuals you have encountered have been struggling with that as well. However her philosophy is a harsh one and some people see her as unfeeling. So that could be the case too.

In essence her philosophy gives man the freedom to be his own master - to recognize no higher authority than his mind. Additionally that mind is his most valuable tool for perceiving his rational world. The majority of the modern world holds altruism as the height of morality. Altruism is - from what I understand - sacrificing yourself or your possessions for the whole. ""You are your brother's keeper."" Now think about it. Why do most people donate to charities

Rand recognized that man's personal happiness is his sole purpose in life. He is free to do whatever he wishes so long AS LONG AS IT DOES NOT INFRINGE ON ANOTHER MAN'S RIGHT TO DO SO. You can give away all your earthly possessions

For as long as I can remember

She has summarized Objectivism with three axioms. 1. Man's life is his standard of value - everything in his life will be judged and given a worth based on whether it adds or subtracts from his quality of life. 2. Production as the moral good - you must produce in order to survive. If man is in the wild alone

Rand allowed me to fully achieve my potential and be proud of what I have done. She also made me understand that not everyone has to be Bill Gates. I'm not the best engineer in the world. I won't make the next big gadget or car. And that's ok. I will never be a millionaire and that's fine. I am producing to the best of my ability and I am satisfied with that.

I hope I made myself clear in this comment. There were many other nuances in her books that rang clear with me

While philosophy of Bioshock is very shallow

- People who live in the city of Rapture are not allowed to leave 
- Some items are declared contraband from the outside world ( bibles
- Andrew Ryan takes money for the maintenance of the city under the sea
- Experimentation on the individuals who are used to eventually create plasmids by the far seem very sketchy transactions
- Various criminal acts are protected by Andrew Ryan for the ""good of the city""
- Andrew Ryans imprisonment of worker organizers for unions and the imprisonment of Dr. Lamb for being a commie
- Andrew Ryan's forceful takeover of Fontaine Futuristics to come into control of plasmids markets
- Many many examples of murder by Andrew Ryan

As you can tell by now, and even in its failure I think there are may examples of social conflict that are worth us objectivists considering how we would deal with:

- How do we deal with extreme business competition with each other.  There are several examples within the book of businesses running each other out of business in extreme ways.  For instance

- How do we deal with sexual harassment in the work place.  Several places are described as being run by business men who are just creeps.  The freedom of Rapture has given business owners a sense of entitlement to demand things from their employers that are just really creepy.

- How do we deal with orphans.  In the book

- How do we treat people who have extreme antithesis ideologies to a free government and wish to attempt a revolution or change its policies to be a communist state?

- How far do we allow contracts to go when dealing with a human life?  
In the world of bioshock

- How do we deal with a large segment of people terribly addicted to drugs?  How do we deal with people who push terribly addictive substances onto people? 

- What scenarios (if any) is the security of the state at risk enough to warrant  the denial of peoples rights

For me, in the sense that I wanted heavy state control of various industries, intrusive regulation of personal consumption habits, militarism and overseas adventures, and state-managed education. More fundamentally, I had little to no awareness of concepts of centralized versus distributed control, spontaneous order

I have since come to characterize my earliest political views as ""'Just do it!' fascism, people should ""just do it."" This covers a broad range of topics. If we ""need"" a bridge here, then the government should just build a bridge. If a certain drug is ""bad"", then the government should just outlaw it. And of course, if people continue to use the drug anyway, then the government should just incrementally ramp up the punishment until the behavior is deterred - up to execution, if necessary.

This obviously is a profoundly naive philosophy that ignores severe concerns such as economic calculation

I also struggled with the ridiculous sex-negativity and self-deprecation that are inculcated in us from a young age. I had a great deal of trouble with interpersonal relationships when I thought I was supposed to feel guilty for wanting to benefit from my relationships.

From the usual mass-media presentations, that any such thing as a course called *Understanding Objectivism* (presented by her best student) exists, etc.  And yet, if you actually ever interact with long-time students of Objectivism, the cognitive-method things are more or less all they ever talk about; at the minimum, they're always implicit in or intertwined with whatever issues they discuss.  The very understanding of such concepts as ""egoism,"" ""individualism"" and ""capitalism"" is deeply conditioned by these epistemic principles.  Whats more, in an essay by that title

I suppose the extent to which one could readily clear up the misconceptions about her philosophy involved here depends on factors such as (1) ability to present correctives to them cogently and effectively (not easy to do); (2) the willingness of the critic to hear out the corrective responses in the spirit of intellectual curiosity (not easy to come by, but those are some big ones.

I think that without exposure to and absorption of *Understanding Objectivism*, I don't see much if any excuse going forward for ignorant commentary on Objectivism.  As it is, hostile commentators have quite a bit of catching up to do given years of intellectual negligence irrespective of this course's publication status; this material in particular just adds rather tremendously to their homework load.

I don't see competent, Objectivism serves as its own best defender given the aforementioned emphasis on integration, context, and hierarchy.  (You can't attack the method without implicitly invoking it - not like any of this is news to the long-time Oists who've spent years immersed in this stuff.  Scholars like Sciabarra will tell you the very same thing.)  I consider yours truly to be perhaps the only person qualified to carry out a decent criticism ""from the inside-out"" as it were, but all that such criticism would really amount to is, ""Rand made mistake X by not taking into account the full context/hierarchy/integration of knowledge as she had prescribed.""  As I hinted at above, I think Aristotle himself would otherwise be quite pleased with the method.  If that's the best that could be done - and I've become convinced after a decade-plus of critically studying this stuff that it is - then the Rand-haters are are pretty much fucked long-run (unless they jump on the team and come on in for the big win [h/t Stanley Kubrick - integration of knowledge

So

**TL;DR:** Philosophy can't be done in abbreviated soundbites

EDIT: It's worth mentioning how enjoyable it is to hear Rand in her Russian accent on recorded radio interviews and whatnot occasionally using the phrase, and outright smears"" to describe the tactics of a great many of her opponents.  There's even one where she uses the beautiful turn of phrase: ""Those who make an effort *not* to understand me, are no concern of mine.""  My preferred phrasing has been to refer to those who go out of their way to miss the point. :-)  Anyway, the distortions, misrepresentations, and outright smears have been going on ever since Rand's day when she could experience them first-hand (and regard them with the contempt they deserved) - most especially in the wake of *Atlas,* since *The Fountainhead* was quite popular in the years following its publication and didn't generate nearly the level of hysterical hate that *Atlas* did.  What's ~~most impressive~~ fucking ridiculous is how, the haters still haven't gotten around to getting any closer to getting it right about her ideas than they did back then; if anything,"" ""hierarchy"" and ""integration"" in connection with Rand even though she regarded these concepts as fundamental to her intellectual worldview - to her definition of *reason* and of *objectivity*.

&gt; Objectivism holds, **neither accepting gifts from others nor giving them**, as both actions are considered moral weaknesses. It attempts to apply the principles of laissez-faire to right and wrong. For Rand the individual’s life has supreme value and self-interest determines ethics. Therefore, Objectivism holds that all forms of altruism are irrational and immoral, **even if they are done voluntarily**

I have been in situations where it's me vs all my friends (or an entire class including teacher). I tend to respond only when asked (mainly because they are sometime curious as to what Objectivism believes).

Incompetence and laziness are the standard, and rather than being praised or rewarded, hard workers are instead singled out for extra duty; the work that doesn't get done by the lazy people is simply dumped on the hard workers.  Chris works with 40-50 other soldiers and has no friends among them, and only a few people whose companionship he can even tolerate.  He's 3,000 miles away from friends and family and understandably having a really hard time staying motivated and happy.  As bad as it is, it would be manageable if he could come home every so often, only in life-or-death emergencies are they *required* to let him go home

Chris doesn't label himself an Objectivist, independence, the sanctity of personal property and responsibility for one's actions, good or bad.  He has what I would call a fundamental understanding of the Objectivist ethics, and has read several things *about* Rand, but nothing *by* her.  One discrepancy that, I think, is his reluctance to embrace the idea of a benevolent universe.  He believes that mankind as a whole is capable of remarkable things and that there are noble people who live up to that potential and should be revered

Now for my actual question: since he can't come home and I can't visit him, at least short term.  Besides fun stuff, I also want to include some books or other media that might inspire him to tweak his thinking just enough that he can weather the next 3 years without being miserable.  I survived a very similar situation, and it was awful, but by constantly practicing and reinforcing a rationally egoistic mindset, I got through it without too much negative energy.  Can anyone recommend reading material, movies, or anything else that might help him out here?  It doesn't have to Objectivist literature, but not mandatory, which is a fantasy fiction series by an Objectivist author strongly focused on Rand's ethics.  

Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks for reading

What's the inverse of ""fake but accurate""? ""True but false""!

""Fake but accurate""—the New York Times description of the Rathergate memo in 2004—was the mainstream media's attempt to admit that a document supporting their preferred story line was a forgery

Notice a pattern? The pre-determined story line comes first

""True but false"" comes to us by way of the Washington Post's ""fact-checker"" Glenn Kessler

Normally, too.

The Republicans had given the press a full set of numbers to back up their claim, and how it's just a matter of unfortunate timing, and so on. So he concludes, absurdly, by calling the RNC's claim ""true but false.""

The Hot Air blog pokes some well-deserved fun at this and also provides what seems to me to be an actual

But the most fascinating part about this is the basic epistemological issue. The mainstream media has set up a raft of these so-called ""fact-checking"" columns, but then they override the facts because they don't like the interpretation that the facts imply.

One suspects that confusing the difference between fact and interpretation is precisely the point. That's the old racket of the mainstream media. They set themselves up as the exclusive arbiters of fact; when Walter Cronkite said, uncontroversial ""fact,"" saving them from the tedious job of arguing for it.

1326703597.0,oj3vh,Ayn Rand refutes Ayn Rand's theory of government,Krackor,29,16,84,"What is the nature and purpose of government?

&gt;The only proper purpose of a government is to protect man’s rights, and, as such, may resort to force only against those who start the use of force. The only proper functions of a government are: the police, to protect you from criminals; the army, to protect you from foreign invaders; and the courts, to protect your property and contracts from breach or fraud by others, according to objective law.

-
&gt;A government is an institution that holds the exclusive power to enforce certain rules of social conduct in a given geographical area.

-
&gt;The fundamental difference between private action and governmental action—a difference thoroughly ignored and evaded today—lies in the fact that a government holds a monopoly on the legal use of physical force

Whence does the government derive its right to this monopoly?

&gt;The government of [a free] nation is not the ruler, derived from their right of self-defense).

-
&gt;The source of the government’s authority is “the consent of the governed.” This means that the government is not the ruler

Oh okay; a government gets its rights by individuals delegating to it their right to self-defense. That makes sense. Is there any condition under which an individual would not delegate that right to the government?

&gt;The citizens of a free nation may disagree about the specific legal procedures or *methods* of implementing their rights (which is a complex problem

So if an individual disagrees with his government's methods of implementing his rights

&gt;The common denominator of such [advocates of “competing governments”] is the desire to escape from objectivity (objectivity requires a very long conceptual chain and very abstract principles), with the men of their own gang bound by the same concretes.

Oh

&gt;The retaliatory use of force requires *objective* rules of evidence to establish that a crime has been committed and to *prove* who committed it, are a lynch mob. If a society left the retaliatory use of force in the hands of individual citizens, it would degenerate into mob rule, lynch law and an endless series of bloody private feuds or vendettas.

So objectivity in law comes from... the synergy of individuals collected under a government? Is that what I'm hearing? Wait a second...

&gt;Any group or ""collective, the ""rights"" of any group are derived from the rights of its members through their voluntary, individual choice and *contractual* agreement, and are merely the application of these individual rights to a specific undertaking.

-
&gt;A group

&gt;Any group that does not recognize this principle is not an association

-
&gt;Just as the notion that ""Anything I do is right because *I* chose to do it,"" is not a moral principle, but a negation of moral principles and the banishment of morality from social issues.

-
&gt;The source of the government’s authority is “the consent of the governed.” This means that the government is not the ruler

-
&gt;Under a proper social system

So the individual right to self-defense is only delegated to government on a voluntary basis

&gt;The use of physical force—even its retaliatory use—cannot be left at the discretion of individual citizens.

I decided to read some critiques of the philosophy in order to have a well rounded view. There was only one argument (from James Rachels) that stuck with me and it went along these lines:

There is a family of moral views that involve dividing people into groups and saying one group's interests count for more than the others'. Racism is an example of this: people are split into groups based on race and one race is treated better than another. However, a white person and a black person that would justify treating them differently. This makes racism an arbitrary doctrine.

You may be wondering what this has to do with Objectivism. Well

""1. Any moral doctrine that assigns greater importance to the interests of one group than to those of another is unacceptably arbitrary unless there is some difference between the members of groups that justifies treating them differently.
2. Ethical Egoism [Objectivism] would have each person assign greater importance to his or her own interests than to the interests of others. *But there is no general difference between oneself and others
3. Therefore

I have trouble refuting this argument. It seems pretty tight. I would like to believe Objectivism is the right philosophy but as long as I am unable to refute this argument I can't. If any of you can offer some insight please do.

John Allison just confirmed my worst fears about his assumption of leadership at Cato. In this statement to Cato employees, I believe almost all the name calling between libertarians and objectivists is irrational. I have come to appreciate that all objectivists are libertarians, but not all libertarians are objectivists. I respect this distinction, (although I consider anarchy to be dangerous)."" 

That's what I expected John Allison to do, it seems.

I must say, as a matter of its fundamental principle, embraces people of any philosophic persuasion whatsoever -- including fundamentalist Christians, smash-the-state anarchists, opponents of intellectual property, abortion opponents, pedophilia advocates, blame-America-first pacifists, and more. Objectivism

So if you thought that JA would move the libertarian movement (and Cato) in an Objectivist direction, he's succeeded. 

I am an Objectivist. I am not a libertarian, and I work with better libertarians on an ad hoc basis -- same as with liberals, conservatives, and Objectivists. Still, dammit, I am not a libertarian.

The same, given John Allison's seat on the board and other close ties, as well as their support of his position at Cato. From now on, they richly deserve to be referred to as ""the libertarian Ayn Rand Institute.""

I think the obvious point is that Ayn Rand herself preached [no *initiation* of force](http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/physical_force.html) on man as a main tenant of the philosophy. What happened to the natives was indeed force.

Ayn Rand had **her** views and they were based on Objectivism while we have **ours** and they too are based on Objectivism. By simply applying strict Objectivist philosophy to a situation (reasoning) you can see that what happened was wrong and I am willing to accept that Ayn Rand was not a perfect person. Who is? But the fact that she came closer than most and that we strive every day to get there is what counts.

If you've met one

I was 20, Locke, Mill, Tocqueville, Federalist Papers, etc. On every day of class, the prof has 3 different students introduce themselves, major

And that's exactly what I heard. One day, but not too revealing, so as to not alienate myself like I inevitably do. I say something like, ""There's not really anything that you'd find interesting about me--I enjoy reading textbooks and I only listen to classical/baroque/romantic music."" Nobody says anything; the prof politely acknowledges having heard me and moves on.

I breathe a sigh of relief at having avoided standing out when the prof calls on somebody else, character flaw/s. She instantly replies to the professor, her tone expressing honest confidence, and her gaze never unlocking with the prof's. I could tell just by the two sentences she spoke that she wasn't some princess who depends on her beauty to get what she wants (although she easily could have).

Her answer was something along the lines of

To understate it

So weeks go on, everybody except me and this girl. We both laugh as soon as the joke processes, and we both look over at the other. Our eyes locked. At this moment I feel the single most profound emotion that has ever been caused by another person--and I don't identify it. All I know is that now we have our common basis and I am going to use it to its fullest advantage. 

After class I wait after and we talk. She tells me that her personal philosophy is based on the primacy of truth,"" but she explained how she defined truth and the process she uses to reach it, and mentioned a preference for the ""hard truth."" Exactly my kind of 'truth.'

So we begin talking regularly, to the empirical, and even to the metaphysical; we trade books (she first gave me Dorian Grey and I gave her the Fountainhead); we exchange writings; but overall we just wanted to be in each other's company--to bounce thoughts off of, to discuss that which nobody else wants to discuss, and most importantly: **to help each other grow as people**. This goal was made explicit from the beginning; we realized our degrees of awareness could be used to constructively critique everything about each other (all except aesthetics). All this continues for about 8 months until we pass a certain point when it is readily apparent to both of us that we are extremely in love with each other.

I have several other stories (of similar length) of meeting de facto Objectivists, takes the cake.

If others with not-so-great understanding dismiss Rand, that of course is not proof at all that someone who seriously understands Rand is going to dismiss it.

But what's really egregious about this set of comments is that Tara Smith (*Ayn Rand's Normative Ethics*) receives no mention, Miller, and Lennox, as well as prominent Nietzsche scholar, Lester Hunt, on its steering committee) receives no mention, Peikoff receives one tangential mention (so no mention of his systematic treatment of Rand in OPAR, which was published months prior to this blog discussion), and while there are numerous mentions of Nozick's ""On the Randian Argument

All of these people or sources are either ignored or unknown by the critics/dismissers of Rand in the comments section.  Roderick Long (co-editor with Sciabarra of the *Journal of Ayn Rand Studies* and co-author of the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on Rand) showed up in the comments section to ask those bashing the SEP entry to explain themselves

This is not philosophy; this is a farce.  Ignorance parading as knowledge; one-sidedness parading as fairness and balance.  It's ridiculous.

If people seriously wanted to know about and understand Rand as those who've seriously studied her ideas understand them, Smith, Sciabarra, or the ""Dougs.""

What this travesty of a blog entry and comments section indicates, perhaps without the requisite exactness to really nail these ignorant critics/dismissers and paint them into a logical corner of their own making, that it boils down to *politics*, and if you don't think politics is a key corrupting influence in academic ""philosophy,"" then you haven't been around academic philosophy.  I'll venture to say that it's *all* about politics and the various cognitively-biasing factors that go along with that.  Whatever it is, it isn't philosophy in the true sense of the term.

How can these people remain ignorant of the key secondary literature on Rand and still claim to be doing anything fair and balanced?  It's insane.

This is such a slam-dunk, or Salmieri, or . . .) find to debate *then*?

And there's where academic ""philosophy"" falls into such a sinkhole that I don't know how it would recover (other than to embrace Rand-and-Aristotle studies).  There is *no* figure within academic philosophy who possesses the knowledge or expertise to make a remotely credible case against Rand/Objectivism.  What we *do* see - for anyone who cares to open their eyes and look - is numerous (and expanding in number) scholars who possess much familiarity with Objectivism right down to its epistemological-methodological core - scholars with high-profile academic pedigrees, particularly in the content and style of her own criticisms/dismissals of *other* thinkers, namely Kant...).

I must say that going from *Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas* to *We the Living* was a massive shock; I went from a world with so many wonders, gray, incredibly gray, world where humans wither away and decay, where the ones who still have that urge to fight, the ones who would normally be above all, simply take longer to lose that urge than all their other peers.

There are technical things that I can criticize almost every book for; but, and I did not enjoy this.

And perhaps the most discordant thing in my mind is that the work is technically flawless: The prose is excellent; the imagery is amazing; and the characters are realistic

I've been giving a lot of thought to some challenges in applying Objectivism in today's world and I was hoping that you might be able to help me work thought them. There are two distinct issues I'd like to tackle

**An Objectivist *country* in today's world.**

So imagine a country - lets say my home

 - The police

 - The armed services

 - The law courts

In a purely theoretical and moral sense I agree with that 100% however when you apply it to a reality where there are other nation states with over a hundred different shades of government and different ways of doing business things get more complicated

 - A ""Department of Foreign Affairs"", looks after the rights of citizens of Australia while they're overseas and provides a liaison with other countries for their citizens when they are here.

 - A ""Department of Trade"", domestic subsidies, over or under valued currencies, policies requiring domestic procurement and production etc present barriers to overseas competition).

 - A ""Department of Immigration and Citizenship""

 - A ""Department of Primary Industries"", fruit flies pose a major risk to agriculture so we control how fruit is transported in to agricultural areas).

These four fairly basic services were what I came up with off the cuff... I'm sure I could come up with a few more points too

So my first question is ""are the three purposes of government put forward by Rand negotiable? in essence

Second question: ""if it is to be seen as a framework

But for all we know

And that's where intellectual and cultural revolution comes in.  We need it to happen ASAP.  We need, a society of, by, and for the human intellect.  To make this happen would require a program of education.  We should not conflate education with schooling.  Education can happen, especially in the internet age, via online resources, via social media, parents and political leaders pay mostly lip service to: the fullest-possible cultivation of the human intellect.

This program of education can happen at virtually any age, of philosophy.  And we need to assign to Aristotle and Aristotelianism a place of utmost importance in such a program.  Aristotle's approach to philosophy represents the height of critical thinking in action.  What's more, there's an ethical and socio-political dimension to Aristotelianism that holds tremendous appeal to conscientious mainstream Americans (and non-Americans as well).  It places human flourishing or *eudaimonia* at the center of focus and emphasizes the role of maximal intellectual activity to achieving and maintaining *eudaimonia*.

So, what my query is transformed into is: How do we best and most expeditiously ignite the people's interest in an Aristotle-inspired intellectual, ethical, cultural, social and political program?  Or, put more generally: how can we best ignite the people's interest in a *philosophical* mode of living, so as to maximize our chances for individual and social flourishing?

These come down to strategic questions.  Have we strategically-minded folks here?

On Friday I had a run in with a colleague which has been bugging me all weekend. The actual topic isn't really relevent because the process of the argument was so vanilla:

Me: X right should exist

Him: X right should not exist

Me: But there are reasons

Him: But you don't need A

Me: Because not everybody wants to live exactly like you do


I have since come to a theory that I'd like to chew out with you free thinkers - I am thinking that there are three broad categories that people will approach a conversation on rights from:


 - Emotion

Example: ""Marriage is between a man and a woman


 - Rights negative: These people start with the assumption that a right does not exist and then challenge the other party to show why they SHOULD HAVE the right.

For example

 - Rights affirmative: these people assume that every right is held by every person

For example:

An absolute right to free speech clashes with a right to not be slandered/defamed

An absolute right to abortion clashes with the right of a healthy 40 week old fetus/baby to live


---

""Rights Negative"" could be changed to ""Privilege Based"" and ""Rights Affirmative"" could also become ""Rights Based"" if that works better for you, or asset that the right always exists and seek to define how it might need to be moderated.

Do you feel this is an accurate observation?

If so

Cheers!

""X Right"" is the right to own

""A, collection, self defense, commerce, research and development"" or any other reasonable reason.

I enjoy Ayn Rand's writings (both fictional and philosophical) and consider myself close to, and I was wondering what my fellow reason-lovers think of the economics and politics of global climate change.

*Note: I am an objectivist

Here's are some of my thoughts.  It's a long post.  Please let me know what you think.

* 1: Why it is something to be mindful of. 

It seems like there is conclusive evidence that the amazing industrial advances we have come up with is affecting our climate
Implications that can limit or destroy other human's livelihoods and lives.
Implications that may come about in my life time.

* 2: Why it is reasonable to want to do something about it.

It seems like human-caused global climate change is a fact of reality
Personally and selfishly, and others who I love and care about.
Also, I have some fondness for our future society.  (Please give me your thoughts on this view—kind of a “how do you other objectivists feel about the future?” question.)

* 3: Those who ignore it.

I believe that those who ignore this threat are denying reality, an assumption on my part is being made that people will love at least one family member of their future generations, or at least one person significantly younger than themselves.  I understand this will not always be the case, but I think it is common.) 

* 4: The scale of this problem is weird for an objectivist.

The following quote from Ayn Rand
&gt; ""When I disagree with a rational man, I will; one of us will win, but both will profit.”

Does damage

1347047940.0,ziso3,"Rant: Intellectual property, and why I feel i'm no longer libertarian",daedius,18,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Objectivism/comments/ziso3/rant_intellectual_property_and_why_i_feel_im_no/

Hey /r/objectivism, I've finally come to believe in intellectual property.  It took me some real heavy brain cycles but I think I finally understand the philosophical underpinnings. Most of you agree with me the system around it is far from perfect.  But I will attempt to explain why I find the system justified and my explanation of what ""property"" actually is.  All in all I realized property is a much more contentious concept than what I originally believed ( both physical property and intellectual property ).


What exactly was it I was misunderstanding? There was a commonality to physical property and intellectual property i don't think I was paying attention to, comes into existence in pretty much the same way as intellectual property.  The concept of homesteading process, is in fact, in essence very similar to taking your patent to the patent office. A man must prove he has created significant value to own something.  Back in the early American days, I think all this involved was having a fence, and a structure with one window.
 

Imagine a world, property does not exist yet because nobody claimed a piece. Adam has to create value to live, and that act and effort must give him ownership to say, make a farm, otherwise he will die.  He must be able to make his cake and eat it too. Don't get me wrong, there are some societies with no concept of ownership exist.  They may be tribal or maybe even modern communistic.  But there is a natural law that mankind relies on natural resources still sitting there no matter what a tribe, state, we might have entirely different concepts of property.  But the natural law remains, needs to be able to own his creations of value


The other half of my beliefs that were holding me back was that I had misconceived how crystal clear physical property was as a concept.  I used to think that physical property is pretty set in stone and ""so easy to see"" but really it is not.  The whole concept of homesteading ( determining what value a person has to do to own a piece of land ) is just as nebulous as determining if a software patent is of enough value or not for someone to own.  It just appeared to me as though physical property seemed ""crystal clear"" because of the inertia of America's property laws, there are uncertainties for instance, some native american tribes might have better claims to land than some modern Americans.


Property is all just a battle of people claiming they've created value to the world, there's no cut and dry answers to what value actually is.  This requires the honest debate of thoughtful men to determine.


My principles are now in line with my gut feelings of fairness toward creators


What are some of the results of this understanding

* I don't feel I can agree with libertarians who are against IP now
* I now have more sympathy toward RIAA/MPAA
* I think to fix the patent office
* I feel that virtual economies will really need help in the future in protecting property rights to come in order for us to truly be able to survive off of them

I am addressing this request to all Objectivists and adherents to Ayn Rand’s philosophy.  No doubt it is clear to all (of the above) that socialism has taken over the entire industrial world, except for reiterating a major point – things are getting worse and, in the foreseeable future will not get better.  The end result, of course, will be a collapse, but that is not much of a consolation if we, and our families, possible civil wars and, hidden somewhere in Colorado.  Unfortunately

This is really not that farfetched.  There are several studies, but they appear to seek the Atlantis – based on laissez-faire capitalism and free from existing governments.  So far as I know, these have all been paper studies of fairly small structures that are not completely self-sufficient or independent.  But what if a large, self-sufficient city state can be built?  Based on Objectivist principles, it will attract the best minds; based on laissez-faire capitalism they will be productive; and not being under the control of socialist governments, they will thrive.  Is such a city state possible?  Technologically, I think that it is possible.  Perhaps even with today’s technology.  With tomorrow’s – it is inevitable.  Is it feasible economically?  Today – that depends on how much one values their freedom and unrestricted pursuit of happiness.  Tomorrow

My proposal is to begin this process ourselves.  We are a community of thousands of professionals.  We have the skills and the knowledge to accomplish at least the first phase – a design of such a city state.  Physical and cultural/socio/political design.  The New Atlantis will have to be large enough to support itself, we can create a database of designs, in an almost game-like manner, where professionals in various fields submit their designs in the area of their expertise.  These designs would be peer reviewed and awarded merit tokens based on the complexity and value of their designs, similar to the Bitcoin system.  The complexity of the design will be enormous – the physical design itself will have to address everything needed for complete life-support system, from power to water to air, and a myriad other all important details, but so amended as to prevent its degeneration) and the laws written as well.

For those who would like to participate in the project, by working on this project, you can have real hope for the future.

I have thought of some details, good or bad.

•	Ayn Rand advocated moral egoism

* Moral egoism is **exactly** the same as hedonism

* Interestingly enough

* He knew this person who died from a heroin overdose

* Of course

•	“Quoting” from *The Virtue of Selfishness*: “Any Rand said that it is immoral to help another person” – LITERALLY

•	Moral egoism can explain everything in terms of self interest

* A theory that explains everything is fundamentally flawed

* There’s actually an interesting point (very well) hidden in this line of thinking

•	Moral egoism denies that equals should be treated equally

* This was “explained” in a personal example of how the professor was in Cuba and the music school there only lets people in based on talent, no grants, loans, etc.

* This is wrong! Wrong he says!

* However the first part is okay.

•	Feinberg’s Single-Minded Hedonist apparently shows that a rock cannot be happy

•	I wish I had brought a bottle of wine to class today

And on a final note, I’ve found that pointing out how college-level professors (at least in introductory courses) are…mistaken…doesn’t actually do anything.  After all, *he’s published!*  (And apparently, if you’re a moral egoist, you can’t argue for moral egoism???  Really didn’t get that….)

every 'is' implies an 'ought.'"" ... ""The Objectivist ethics holds man’s life as the standard of value—and his
own life as the ethical purpose of every individual man.""

This is from the very first lecture in the Virtue of Selfishness
words ""good"" and ""evil"" and describes why it maters. In reading this
living creature, and ""good thing"". Which is reasonable, since one 
cannot have any goals or values after one is dead.

That said
from a doctor. Why is it not morally good for him to obtain the services of a doctor without paying for them himself? He can go to a private doctor and threaten that doctor with force
lie about his ability to pay
treatment at an emergency room based on finances.

Given that the alternative is death for this man
lesser goals are the means
doctor wouldn't have done? Does that not mean that avoiding taking from the doctor is a higher goal for him than 
saving his own life? Isn't he sacrificing his life to avoid taking unfair advantage of the doctor or society or 
whoever winds up footing the bill?

This is the fundamental disconnect I haven't been able to figure out. 

Rand starts throwing around ""man qua man"" 
phrases, you're neither man nor are you man qua man. Plus, man is still a living organism, and all living organisms have a goal to keep living, rational or not. Arguing that the sick man should die because he's rational but the starving coyote is good with killing and eating the rabbit would seem to imply that life is *not* the highest value for rational creatures.

She talks about ""The virtue of Rationality means the recognition and acceptance of reason
as one’s only source of knowledge
only guide to action."" Yet nothing in her description of rationality implies that one should not initiate force against 
others to save one's own life. It seems completely rational that if I'm dying and I can't afford the medicine
should try to steal it.

Is Rand saying it's OK to steal or even murder to save your life? Because that's usually not what I hear Objectivists claim.",self,t5_2qjr6,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Objectivism/comments/te4un/maybe_someone_can_explain_this_to_me/

I'm all for a free market and argue in favor of it all the time. Trouble is

Capitalism works because it leaves the choice of whether to buy something up to the consumer and hence that dictates the prices at which a producer can sell at; however, such as it is, goes to paying off their medical bills isn't that also a detriment to the rest of us, for example.

When I first got into Objectivism

For this reason

It is 6am, but all of sudden doesn't sound like a good plan anymore. I begin the self-dueling back-n-forth, which, at 6am, consists of an impressive amount of rationalizations, bargaining, whim worship

My status-quo in this type of case is to, been doing it for years, but I'm realizing that it might not be the best way to go. So this time, I didn't try to cast off or condemn my supposedly 'wrong' emotions and just thought them through (introspection):

Does it make sense to feel this way? - *there are no causeless emotions* -
Why did I feel motivated last night
How does this make sense? What else do I know about emotions?*

And then I started to see, 6am, lying comfortably in bed. What did I expect to feel in this time and place? Would it make more sense, in this context, to feel elation at the prospect of getting out of bed and going into the cold for exercise? So, this time, I consciously and deliberately acknowledged the fact that I ought, feel the way I do (Lazy

At first, something was different. I wasn't fighting myself with emotional suppression, I wasn't 'forcing' myself toward action, I wasn't trying to bury the 'lazy' feelings. I had accepted that what I felt lying in bed, is not what I feel now, nor should it be - emotions are current. My mental 'state' was not bogged down, I was free to move onto the next moment

Since that morning, and I believe that grasping the 'present' aspect of them in a personal way has made a big difference.
