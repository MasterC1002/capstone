**1. IDEA GENERATION**

While sometimes writers have those ah-ha! moments where we are flooded with a mostly thought out concept

For example, Harold &amp; Kumar Go To White Castle was a successful comedy spawning two sequels, and it's entire premise is ""two stoners want a cheeseburger."" So no idea is off limits here.

**2. HOW DO I TURN THE IDEA INTO A SCRIPT?**

Every writer swears by their own technique. Some writers will start with coming up with an initial logline. The benefits are having something to guide you while writing, it's kind of complicated...""

But something almost all writers will do is have something of an outline. What does an outline look like? That's going to vary widely. Some writers prefer to keep their outlines bare bones and will only map out key points (typically plot points). Other writers will get detailed and break it down by scene. An outline may have notes such as ""Hero captured by Villain in their lair, and so on.

There is no right or wrong way to outline. It's whatever will help you write.

**3. STRUCTURE**

Many writers will base their outlines on specific structures or formulas. Structure is what gives the story a feeling of cohesiveness

* Plot point/3-Act-based Structure

There are variations within this, middle, and end). Acts 1 and 3 should each be roughly 25% of the script, and Act 2 should be roughly 50% of the script.

Some structures and formulas of this type will have a few plot points, midpoint, climax, and resolution. Plot points are essentially mile markers that help the writer keep the story interesting and with purpose.

3. [Screenplay: The Foundations of Screenwriting](http://www.amazon.com/Screenplay-Foundations-Screenwriting-Syd-Field/dp/0385339038)

* Sequence Structure

Sequence structure is based off of three acts as well. Plot points can be used with this still

The common version of this holds that there should be eight sequences in the script. Sequences are roughly 12-15 pages in length. If you do the math, a question that the audience worries about, in addition to the story's main tension (which is usually ""will the protagonist succeed?""). The purpose for this is to constantly have something for the audience to be concerned about, thus getting them to invest in the movie. And since your tension changes every 12-15 pages, your script is less likely to become boring.

Here's what sequence structure ends up looking like:

Act|Sequence|Notes
:---|:---|:---
Act One | Sequence One | Often ends with inciting incident
 | Sequence Two | Ends in Act Break 1
Act Two | Sequence Three |
 | Sequence Four | Ends in Midpoint
 | Sequence Five | 
 | Sequence Six | Ends in Act Break 2
Act Three | Sequence Seven | Often ends with a false resolution or twist
 | Sequence Eight | Ends in resolution

Television is a different beast when it comes to structure, and a tag, for instance. But this would not apply to every show.

The best way to learn structure for television is to read television scripts. If you're writing a pilot spec

2. [Television Script Database](https://sites.google.com/site/tvwriting/)

**4. HOW DO I ACTUALLY WRITE THE SCRIPT?**

There are numerous tools out there for writing scripts, Android, and iOS. Here is a list of some:

* [Final Draft](http://www.finaldraft.com) (Windows / Mac / iOS) - The desktop versions of this software are considered the industry standard
* [Celtx](http://www.celtx.com) (Windows / Mac / Linux / iOS / Android) - The basic version of this software is free. The desktop version also provides many pre-production tools so you can actually film your script as well.
* [Movie Magic Screenwriter](http://www.screenplay.com) (Windows / Mac) - Another full featured program. But the company has many other tools available to assist in the writing process
* [Scrivener](http://literatureandlatte.com/) (Windows / Mac) - Although not intended specifically for screenplays, or used as a rough draft tool and then exported into Final Draft for final publishing. There's also a bunch of tools for writing beyond screenplays as well, including novels, poetry, theses, textbooks, ebooks

**5. I WROTE THE SCRIPT. NOW WHAT?**

Assuming you have received feedback and rewrote your script, or both. There are two main avenues for this that I'll touch on.

* Competitions / Fellowships

These will not sell your script directly

Top Competitions and Fellowships:

1. [Nicholl Fellowship](http://www.oscars.org/awards/nicholl/) - Winners are paid $35
2. [Austin Film Festival](http://www.austinfilmfestival.com/) - Considered by many to be the top film festival for screenwriters.
3. Production Company Fellowships - Many big name companies offer fellowship competitions. You're often competing for what amounts to a paid internship where you learn from within the company. Some companies include [Disney/ABC](http://www.abctalentdevelopment.com/)
4. [Withoutabox](http://www.withoutabox.com) - Not a competition itself

* Pitching / Queries

Here you are directly selling yourself and script. You can pitch to an agent, you are trying to get the person or company interested in reading what you wrote.

Pitches come in two basic forms: the elevator pitch and the formal pitch. The elevator pitch is where you only have maybe 30-seconds to pitch your idea. The name comes from the idea of meeting a producer or development exec on the elevator and pitching them within that amount of time. This is where your logline comes in real handy. The formal pitch can last 5-minutes, you are giving the best aspect(s) of your script - the parts that make the person you're pitching to practically beg you to read it.

There are also pitching festivals

A query is a one-page letter that is sent out to these same people. At minimum it'll contain your contact information and a logline. Many writers choose to expand on that and include things such as a one-paragraph synopsis

FURTHER READING:

1. [The Art of Pitching](http://www.sydfield.com/featured_theartofpitching.htm)
2. [Pitches](http://johnaugust.com/qanda/pitches)

**6. WHAT ABOUT AGENTS AND MANAGERS?**

The rule goes that you cannot sell a script without an agent. This isn't entirely true. You are free to query your work without one

But if you want to sell to a major production company

* Agent

An agent is a representative of talent. They get people hired. Depending on the company, [ICM](http://www.icmtalent.com/), and [United Talent](http://www.unitedtalent.com/) (UTA). Agents are paid when you get paid. The average pay for agents is 10% (this can vary depending on local laws). If they say you owe them money upfront to hire them, they are a scam.

* Manager

A manager focuses more on your career as a whole rather than getting specific work. Your manager should have excellent contacts and work with you. A manager will have fewer clients and work more directly with you. Managers are paid much like agents

**7. HOW DO I GET A JOB AS A TV WRITER?**

You should have some original work, dialogue, story arcs, etc. Do not write ""big"" episodes where an aspect of your episode would continue into future episodes, such as introducing a new character or killing a character off. Your spec should be stand-alone, and be based off of a ""typical"" episode, not a sweeps. You should also write for a show that's in at least its second season.

A major point that needs to be noted here is DO NOT write for the show you want to write for. Write for a similar one instead. If you want to write for New Girl

**7a. I HAVE THE PERFECT SCRIPT FOR HBO/SHOWTIME/FX/AMC**

I'm writing this as a separate section because it seems to be talked about a lot on here. The network isn't who you want to talk to. You want to talk to production companies. Essentially how it works is the network will purchase rights to air the show from the production company. So you need to talk to the people who actually make the shows.

I should note that some networks have their own production companies

Example: Scrubs was produced by a company called Doozer. NBC had the airing rights. When NBC cancelled Scrubs, had Scrubs co-produced with ABC Studios (then called Touchstone Television) as part of the arrangement.

**8. SHOULD I GO TO FILM SCHOOL?**

There's no easy answer to this one. Film schools provide a lot of knowledge, the best filmmakers, including writers, often went to college (not always film school) and have a bachelors or masters degree.

**9. MISCELLANEOUS RESOURCES**

* [IMSDb](http://www.imsdb.com) - A website with numerous scripts of produced work.

I say we just stop doing that.

Should you start your screenplay with ten pages of dialogue that isn't pushing the story forward?  Probably not. Are there valid reasons why you probably shouldn't?  Yes.  Are any of those reasons that you aren't Tarantino?  No.

The discussions in r/screenwriting should generally be about how to write a compelling story and/or about getting your script read/sold (and these two topics overlap a lot).  The same pieces of advice that we come across over and over are super useful and I expect everyone to be familiar with them if they are even semi-serious about being a screenwriter.  However

So when someone asks, ""well a reason you would wanna introduce your protagonist right away is blah blah blah"" or ""as a script reader, if I don't know who your protagonist is by page five, blah blah blah"", but not ""you aren't the Coen brothers, bro, forget about it"".  We wanna start discussions

All that being said, rather than speculating how only Hitchcock can kill off the hero halfway through the movie.  And if you pull something like that off, I'll be the first to applaud you.

1336860472.0,tk653,I'm a professional reader and here are a few quick things you should eliminate from your writing.,ireadformoney,181,31,62,"I’m a reader and this is a throwaway. I am not doing an AMA. You can take these or leave them or debate them.  But I'm right.  If I come across as rude, that's why I'm mad.

These are things I see often and usually by bad writers.  Not to say good writers won’t occasionally use some of these, I hope that you do.  Most of these have to do with being economical and delivering tighter descriptions.  I’m only doing this to maybe spare myself from coming across these so frequently.  You should know these things. They may seem insignificant, but when a reader only reads, these jump out and could elicit a premature judgment of your writing.  In no particular order:

1) On your face.  If someone smiles, we know it’s on their face.  Where else would a smile be?  With a smile on his face.  Just “With a smile.” 

2) He nods his head.  Or He shakes his head ‘no’. Nods means ‘yes’, if he shakes his head, we know it means no.

3) The best he can.  Or The best they can.  They clean the house the best they can. He talks her down the best he can. This means nothing

4) Very pregnant.  You’re not clever, is if they’re in the early stages of pregnancy, we’ll assume they’re very pregnant otherwise.

5) They fight.  They kiss. They have sex. Too dry.  Lame, the sex, however brief, show what we’ll see onscreen.

6) He is walking, they are talking.  Just write He walks, He talks, They walk, They talk. Everyone should know this, yet I see it ALL the time.

7) Suddenly and all of a sudden.  Go ahead and eliminate suddenly from your vocabulary.  If you use ‘all of a sudden’ it might already be too late for you.

8) Starts doing his homework.  Begins searching for files. Just do the action. He does his homework. He searches for files. 

9) Be sparse with your adverbs and adjectives.  A large aircraft, and lame.

10) Watch your spacing after periods. Hard to notice, but remain consistent.  

11) Don't write Well

I hope this helps.

***

A hero’s success is earned. He should learn from his defeats.

Allow characters to have lives offscreen.

Arrive late

As much as possible

Avoid people saying what they mean

Be a sadist.

Chance should only work against the characters.

Connect all scenes with “Therefore” or “But.”

Cut the dialogue shorter.

Danger must be immediate

Dialogue’s use is primarily to reveal character

Discard your first five ideas.

Don’t talk down to the audience.

Every character should want something they can’t get.

Figure out the structure first

Finish first

Gain audience empathy early via the hero’s actions.

Get to the plot fast. Don’t fluff the intro with backstory.

Imagine your scene in a foreign language if you get stuck.

Imply a larger world.

Kill what you love.

Know where the story is going by page 17.

Lure characters forward while chasing them from behind. 

Make secondary characters stand out by giving them unique traits.

Monologues should be rare.

Avoid conventional figures of speech.

Raise the stakes. Stack the odds against your characters.

Simplify. Focus. Combine characters. Hop over detours.

Stakes should be primal and ring true.

Start as close to the end as possible.

Stuck? Write down what wouldn’t happen next.

The audience should know everything the hero knows.

The character’s choices should be logical but unexpected.

The hero doesn’t ask questions

The hero should be proactive

The plot should change the hero.

The setting should be vital to the plot.

Use only one piece of magic per movie.

World-building should be quick and merciless.

Wring a variety of emotions from the characters.

I put together a sort of cheat-sheet that has helped me improving when writing dialogue for my characters and thought I would share. Dialogue seems to be one my weak points. It seems that among writers

Anything else to add?  

**Exercises:**

*At lunch

* Note how people talk over each other constantly
* Don’t transcribe the conversation verbatim, and how the flow shifts (or how the dialogue volleys / turns of phrases)

*Write a scene where a couple is buying a mattress*

* They are only allowed to speak about the mattress

""I've always wanted a firm mattress


**Dos:**

* Short
* Include tension and purpose to every word/sentence
* Generally, lengthy monologue is fine but should be 
absolutely warranted
* If you can
* Channel your characters -- quiet the automated voice in your head
* Engage the audience -- viewers are engaged by what the writer doesn’t tell them
* Join scenes late -- i.e.
* Leave scenes early -- i.e.
* Allow characters to exist offstage -- reference their background lives or acts
* Let the scene loop over in your head 10-20 times
* Alternatively
* Have your characters actually listen, instead of each character just speaking because it’s their turn
* When you’re finally done and happy with your scene -- go back and cut the dialogue shorter
* Remember that film is a visual medium -- a motion picture
* Some screenwriters suggest writing to a rhythm; write to the pulse or the beat of your story

**Don'ts:**

* Avoid people saying directly what they mean
* Avoid big speeches
* Avoid “uh” and “um”
* Avoid spellings things out
* Avoid stating the obvious (particularly in respect to things the audience can see or hear)

**Purpose of Dialogue**

Dialogue in film has four major functions: reveal character, and entertain. Aristotle gave us the idea that everything in a story is a microcosm of the entire story, and if it isn't, then it is unrelated (and shouldn't be in the story) -- the same can be said of dialogue. 

*Reveal Character*

* Every line should resonate with who says it
* The flavour of their background should be captured in their word choices
* The syntax (arrangement of words) should be uniquely theirs
* Focus on background, unique world view, education, mannerisms -- and most importantly -- wants and needs
* Strong characters have needs which should come into conflict with the needs of other characters

*Advance the Plot*

* Well-written dialogue imperceptibly moves the story forward -- by having the characters say something that leads to something happening
* A decision is made
* A question is asked
* Information is revealed -- with subtlety 
* Momentum or tension is built
* Even silence at times can be moving
* A cause and effect relationship should be established between what is spoken and what happens next
* Try to instill conflict in your character interactions
* In real life

*Express Subtext*

* Avoid people saying exactly what they mean
* Let visuals, drive the meaning behind words -- trust your audience and your actors

*Entertain the Audience*

* Dialogue needs to evoke a visceral response and engage the audience
* Whether it’s a funny line, frightening line, emotion-filled line or so on, the audience should be moved emotionally 
* Engage the audience by...
* Joining scenes late
* Leaving scenes early 
* Allowing characters to exist offstage
* Revealing new information about your characters (reveal the different or unexpected facets of their personalities)
* Thinking about what the audience expects from this film -- Is it a horror? Drama? Comedy? 

A great quote (though from a religious preacher): 

&gt;[Great dialogue requires] thinking out what I have to say, so that, when I say it, he will think what I am thinking

-Draw LINES connecting two characters who are connected (e.g., romantic rivals, lovers, boss/employee, etc.)

Anyone who isn't connected by at least TWO LINES either:

a. Has to go! 

b. Has to be connected in some way (e.g.

OR

c. Has to be COMBINED with another SOLO CHARACTER (to become ONE CHARACTER) so that s/he's now connected by two lines

*The third one is often the best solution (that extraneous 'cousin' character you threw in as a device to teach the hero how to swing a baseball bat

.
.
.

EDIT 1: Obviously I wasn't clear enough b/c some folks misunderstood.

a. *Not all characters need to be connected.*  The idea is that EVERY CHARACTER should be 'related' in some way to AT LEAST TWO OTHER CHARACTERS.  (They're not all related to each other).

b. *The significance of the relationship increases the opportunity for drama/conflict (it's a spectrum):*

Superman flies to save a random stranger from Lex Luthor and we're somewhat involved (especially if it's a baby); but HE cares WAY MORE when he's flying to save *Lois* from Lex Luthor ('the VICTIM'

-Yes

-Yes

-Caveat: some managers focus on certain genres, etc. Do your research, don't send horrors to a female romcom manager.

-Misspellings send a query to the burn folder. Seriously

-Contests, but then managers are contacting you. They do not care one bit about ""top 25%"" or whatever of random contests. Don't waste your money. It makes you sound amateur. 

-Don't mention how many scripts you've written. If you say, you're focusing on selling one script per query, that's it.

-Also, that's it. Lord knows I have dumpsters of bad scripts I've written, but no one knows about those, everyone thinks my first script was brilliant. Get it?

-Don't be creepy. Ie: ""I googled the shit out of you and saw your picture on facebook -- I see you love pizza! I love pizza! My script is about pizza!"" Just no. 

-Don't be arrogant. ""I'm the next Aaron Sorkin."" No you're not. You log line is the only thing that matters.

-Be humble and nice. A manager will

-Be brief. This means a hello, 3 paragraphs, no rambling.

-Write your query professionally. Spell check

-Use forums and friends and family to test your query and script. If your readers are giving you ""yeah

-Finally, you don't want to be remembered as the wet blanket who couldn't take a hint.



Also:

-Screenwriting pitch fests are legit (as long as the execs you're pitching to are from real companies). I've been to many (not as a writer, after the fest, swap stories about the best material they heard. Also the worst. If there's a great pitch, they'll request it. If it's a great script, they'll try to sell it.

-Don't be crazy. Seriously, easiest guy to work with ever."" 

-Paid script reads are bullshit...unless it's by an industry exec. There's a few fests/workshops out there like this. These will be the best notes you'll get in your entire life.

After weeks of rescheduling appointments

First things first, and Sullivan's Travels). I told him that I was very grateful for them, and that I enjoyed them a lot...except for A Star is Born. He laughed and said ""Yeah, Barbra Streisand really wanted to do that. She basically manipulated Kris Kristofferson into doing it. I hate it.""

He let me talk about my thoughts on them for a while. I told him that what I liked about Sullivan's Travels is that I could clearly see the characters and, I thought it played out nicely, plot-wise.

He agreed with a lot that I said. He said he gave me Sullivan's Travels because of my interest in comedy writing. A Star is Born was a prime example of story structure as it demonstrated a rigid skeleton that fits all the criterion for a great story. A screenplay is the blueprint

Ray Donovan was probably the best  example for a TV pilot he's ever seen. The amount of conflict in the Ray Donovan pilot

After talking about the scripts, and then got into filmmaking, but recently decided I was better off a screenwriter. He said that was alright and said that it was important to consider all options.

""I'm a horrible actor. But I love and respect the art of acting. That's why I produce most of the time. If you're not that great at writing, producing is a great way to stay involved with your passions.""

He frequently changed majors as an undergraduate and only went to film school for his graduate year, and how he uses the analytical techniques to develop his stories, ideas, and films. So, always keep to your other interests, because they will always find a way into your writing. You do better at the things you love, no?

On that note

But most importantly, you'll get good and then the career will naturally come. Plus, you can't show anything if you haven't got anything. Most producers don't want you to write something they're looking for, they'd rather produce something you've already written.

On behalf of [WriteOnSC](http://www.reddit.com/user/WriteOnSC), when I start writing out the story, I start from the end. I break it down (he draws four squares on a Post-It) and first I think, 'Okay, how's this thing gonna end?' and then I work backwards; how does act III end, how does act II end, etc.""

""After you've made sure that's solid, but there was something missing. I had it like that for six to eight years. I showed it to Marty (Martin Scorsese) and asked him if he wanted to direct it. So then we talked about it and it was then that I found that missing piece. So, you've got to be patient with your work. And critical. You are the best judge of your work.""

The conversation lasted about an hour. Afterwards, but first I'd have to get off my lazy ass and actually finish a goddamn script! I'm really glad I got the chance to sit down with him. He's a wonderful person. The experience has really motivated me to do a lot more writing, and I hope by sharing it, you guys may also feel the same inspiration as I have felt.",,False,self,1351832076.0,t3_12hjl9

For this

Don't start adapting just yet.  This is to be done in the most professional way

The plan is for Season One to be 6 adapted episodes plus extras (behind-the-scene footage, etc.).  The 6 episodes will vary on running time based on the story to tell.  

Consider these jobs as OWA (Open Writing Assignments) that need to be filled.  I'm in talks with the NoSleep writers and while I'm finalizing the 6 stories to adapt

What I have to offer you.  At the moment, and the chance to work on a cool project.  That's not all, my production company is a signatory with the WGA.  This project is being produced under that, which means screenwriters brought on will receive units toward their WGA membership.  You can read more about units [here](http://www.wga.org/content/default.aspx?id=84).

This will be a process and in the meantime you can check out these links:

*   It is open topic
  
* You can use an older script as long as it hasn't garnered any awards or been sold or optioned. We'd prefer if you wrote a new script during the deadline on your favorite subject but you can also touch up an old one and use again. We won't discriminate.

There is more information at the [PitchFest](http://pitchfest.com/gapf/gapf_faq.shtml#L) website.
  
There's freeware like [Celtx](http://celtx.com/) that you can use to write your script. The basic version is free.

It's so much easier to make big changes to your script if you don't have 20-30 other pages of dialogue that need to change also. Just give each scene a paragraph or so

I know that it's not the most romantic idea

A 9-10 page outline is great, some are just rough sketches. The important part is that when I get to the point where I'm actually in Final Draft, I'll have a starting point for every scene. 

I've had too many scripts crash at the 60 page mark because all the great ideas I had when I sat down have created the perfect shitstorm and there are two options; get frustrated and make up and ending for it all

1375377419.0,1ji7pk,Getting to The Heart And Soul Of Inner Weakness (Or What We Can Learn About Character Writing By Watching Channing Tatum Bring The White House Down),talkingbook,44,9,17,"Spoiler Free (for any movie before 1989). 

So I just watched ‘White House Down’ and thought it would be a fun screenplay to write about.

For a great lesson in the power of character motivation recommend watching Olympus Has Fallen and White House Down in relative proximity to each other. One has fully realized characters, heroism, humor, heart. While the other features a blank killing machine who drives us through a body count north of a horror film. The plots are identical. The experience of viewing, night and day. It’s pretty remarkable.

That said

Will also do my best to avoid any verbiage that implies I’m something I’m not. I am not a screenplay expert. I am not a teacher. I'm not a 'pro reader'. I’m an amateur enthusiast and completely fine with it that way. So please take all this with a grain of salt. I’m just doing my own thing and nobody’s going to get hurt if I express an opinion here and there. When it comes to writing, the only difference between a person who likes to have sex constantly and one who does it for money, is one went pro. Keep that image in mind the next time some eager self promoter corners you in the bathroom at a film festival. 

Now, contextualize, and codify structure to the point of who gives a fuck. It’s often like the blind leading the blind. Which means when you actually come upon something that works and works well, when you find that rug that really ties the room together, it’s natural to get enthused. And like that rug that ties the room together, all the little bits come to form a complete picture. Click enough Lego blocks, next thing you know you’re in Legoland. In this case the rug, the thing that works

Recently, as I’m wont to do, and I came across this article: http://scriptshadow.net/screenwriting-article-11-character-flaws-to-use-in-your-script-right-now/

It details a bunch of famous films (Raiders included…but more on that) and essentially boils the gist of those stories down to key character flaws, that they can do at the end, because they’ve overcome some internal block, and that’s the real story. That aspect is spot on. In fact if you subscribe to the mono-myth, or if you subscribe to the idea that life is about one thing, change, you get the idea. Change can be negative or positive, change is the name of the game. 

So what does this have to do with character motivation and inner weakness? Everything.

Also

However

Why?

**Why** can’t they do the thing they need to do at the start? 

Indiana Jones modulates from an archeologist who has no time for the supernatural, they would be skeptical. To then show that person the face melting climax of Raiders IN REAL LIFE. They would believe. Again, not an arc. That's a logical REACTION. The question with Indiana Jones is, why does he care? Why is he so adamant to get it in a museum? Why is he so driven? The film never explains it. So I will.  

The answer for Indiana Jones is the same answer for EVERY character. 

Why is Indiana Jones so driven

Because deep down
 
Let that sink in for a minute. 

Nothing had much more impact on Indy’s life than a deep, in this case, by the cold steel of a loved authority figure. Namely Henry Jones. His father. ""That's his name, Henry Jones, Junior."", ""I like Indiana."", ""We named the DOG Indiana."" 

And if almost no moment previous had greater impact than suffering that tragic wound, and restored the Grail. Raiders left us in cheers, Last Crusade left us in tears…of joy. Which emotion is more powerful?

That’s the power of character motivation and character motivation comes from one place and one place only

It’s the characters inner

In Die Hard John McClane has a whole heap of external problems; terrorists, bullets flying, broken glass, Hans Gruber, only one bullet left, few allies, and the Twinkies are expired.

But what does that mean? If it’s a shitty story it means he has to deal with those things all at once or one at a time, credits, collect check. Boring.

But there IS one more problem and its the most critical. No, and it’s not that the news is endangering his family by plastering their faces on TV. 

These are also external problems.

His big problem, is that he's a piece of shit divorcee whom nobody loves. Nobody can love. This inner weakness has only to do with him. It makes him angry at his wife for not loving him. It makes him ready to fight because he has a chip on his shoulder, it provides him with something to prove.

His inner weakness is what holds him back AND drives him. It’s what stands between him and Apotheosis. Right up to the end of his looser life; torn, picking glass out of his feet, and dying the way losers die, alone in a bathroom. Until his one friend, a guy he's never met, encourages him to hold on a while longer and in doing so coaxes the Hero out when John admits he's a fuck up and confesses, ""I must have told her a thousand times I loved her. But I never said I was sorry.""

From that point on John has figured out what’s been holding him back. HE has, has been addressed. He’s seen the light and has a renewed strength. We know what must come next as well as he. Save the fucking day. It's a lot like redemption. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrY9eHkXTa4

Looking at it that way, distracting. 

Writers are nothing if not students of human nature. Which means it’s important to get down to the deep

It's about love and self worth

The question of, but it’s not what motivates them.  

Unfortunately it is often a thought exercise that takes a detour around the real question of

The conclusion seems to be that somewhere, unlovable, and as a result, ineffective. Until they heal that wound they'll only be as powerful as their fear allows. That's for every character.

Need a villain? No problem. The villain is the character that let's themselves be owned by that wound. They don’t make it to the redemption stage. The gravity of that pain keeps them down on their own personal Hero’s Journey…only to do their best to satiate whatever pain rules them. Back to Die Hard, and changed her name. 

Again, blah, blah, blah. Nope.

The villain is very similar to the hero because the hero is very similar to us and we all know what it’s like to be wounded. That’s why it’s difficult NOT to empathize

We’ve all been there. The trick, Die Hard, Batman, Daredevil, Channing Tatum…all may be without fear. But they’re never without pain. 

Which brings us back to White House Down. I dare not spoil it suffice to say it has perhaps the most outlandish plot since…wait for it…Independence Day. But what it does have is the drive of highly motivated, the bullets pop, and the rockets launch. Subtract that drive and it’s beyond unwatchable because it rings false. Who would put themselves in such dangerous straits unless they were highly motivated. And not gun to the head motivated. That’s not motivation, that’s coercion. There’s a big, big difference. 

Fortunately the difference is awesome.",self,t5_2qupf,1375411614.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1ji7pk/getting_to_the_heart_and_soul_of_inner_weakness/

As backstory, which is my old home town (although nowadays I live in Berlin). Day before yesterday I arrived in Helsinki, and yesterday afternoon I went to the set.

Like everyone who has seen Adaptation knows, the boom operator is talking to his microphone, lights are being mounted and tuned, walkietalkies are buzzing. I guess it's like visiting your own child in a prison, orphanage or a cult meeting. You thought you knew her so well, you thought you had a good relationship, you thought you would be able to act cool. But when you get there...

Truth to be told, trying to think of what I'll say when someone asks what the hell I'm doing there and tells me to leave. 

When I saw the lighting truck outside the theatre's loading platform, that maybe I could be mistaken as a gaffer or sorts and thus granted entrance. I think I wasn't visibly shaking but for a perceptive viewer my condition would have been revealed by my rapidly blinking eyes as I dug into the backstage-turned-into-my-personal-dark-cave.

In the pitch black darkness I heard distant chatter. The star actress reappeared and disappeared like a ghost. I hid behind a corner as some anonymous staff walked by. I knew they were shooting on the stage so I tried to find my way in the darkness. I was looking for someone I knew, most more than a meter in diameter. I knew nothing of any balloons. Behind the balloons there were people. I tried to see if there would have been someone I knew. Strangers, talking in Finnish, English and Norwegian. The director wasn't there yet, I guess. I gathered my courage and stepped into the light, ready for their piercing eyes to would stab me dead with suspicion. 

No one turned. No one saw me. They were all very busy. I sighed a conflicted breath and tried to look cool

I entered the foyer and suddenly all my fear was gone. I saw the choreographer that I know from a long time ago. I saw the dancers, at least she was smiling. I drank a litre of water.

In a few moments, and then I realized that the sound recordist was actually an old friend of mine. 

Backstage with the dancers I drank some tea and slowly regained my self-esteem. Soon they started to shoot and I found a place to watch without being on the way. As the cameras were rolling I began to smile as I remembered what it really was that was going on

Today I'm going back to the set. Now they're shooting outside. It's one of my facorite scenes in the whole film. I'm still excited but definitely not so morbidly nervous as yesterday. I guess it's only once that you reach the dark and unknown cave, remember to bring a torch with you.

- We split the 52 entries into 4 groups of 13 - and then picked the best 2 scripts from each of these groups. These 8 scripts form the short-list for winners. (We also have some 'honorary mentions' of scripts we really liked

- We are giving each of these final 8 scripts a series of numerical scores in various categories - in the hopes that it'll help the writers know their strengths and weaknesses. These scores will be used to find the winners.

- We are currently waiting for one busy judge to make their final pick for the short-list -- and in the meantime

- We're almost there! I estimate that the results will be available in the next week. (But as always

I am aware that Pitchfest is approaching -- and I'm really sorry we just missed the deadline for Nicholl (it would have been nice to give the feedback in time

But these are lessons we've learned for next time!

It's a supernatural horror about a woman who died in front of her television in a block of flats beginning to control the residents through their TV sets. Or

I'm looking for a new script to get into production in late winter. Ideally in the slasher / supernatural slasher genre, in-camera effects and a smallish cast.

I'd be excited to see something beyond genre tropes; something which lifts it above other films in the genre and makes it stand out as unique and gives it a central theme or message beyond watching teenagers die!

I'm not into sexual violence - that's a big no for me

It's simplest for me to receive loglines and treatments alongside scripts so that I can see quickly what it is you're aiming for.

I've been a redditor for three years now and more often than not when I see people posting on this sub for scripts

Act I: Pitt and Jolie meet and fall in love.  Then ""5 or 6 years later..."" they're married and bored.  We're thrown some red herrings to think they're cheating on each other

Act II: When they realize they're working on opposite sides of a mission

Act III: They then have to fight together to survive the bad guys from both their former employers trying to kill them.

Here's the thing: Compared to the rest of the movie, but it still drags.  And I only just now realized why.  

The two best scenes are them falling back in love while fighting each other, it's all downhill.  There's nowhere left for the story to go because all the internal conflict has been resolved.  They're in love, and they're finally honest with each.  The end.

The only thing left is the external conflict--that there's a bounty on their heads--so they have to fight together to survive.  But it lacks all the sizzle of the previous 90 minutes because the real story conflict--will this married couple's love survive?--has already been answered.

1.) Jettison half the characters, the Biologist. You could even eliminate Dr. Shaw's boyfriend/husband. They add nothing. Focus the story entirely around Dr. Shaw and her DRIVE to determine the origin of life on earth. 

2.) Eliminate the absurd sub-plot about Benjamin Button--oh,"" which isn't much. 

3.) Make David the ""villain."" While Dr. Shaw recklessly pursues her goal, ironically protecting humanity from its own impulses. 

4.) Secret of the ooze. The black ooze is to 'Prometheus' what ""dino DNA"" is to 'Jurassic Park.' Actually, and involve a Frankenstein-style plot. The whole scientific effort on LV-223 should have centered around figuring out about this mysterious black ooze. What does it do? How is it made? And what happens if you ingest it? Instead, it's never really explained, and seems capable of doing everything from making giant squid monsters, penis monsters, to turning astronauts into zombies.

5.) Make the squid monster cesarean the mid-point ""pinch"" instead of some hackneyed random event. This was a really cool scene

6.) Clearly define Dr. Shaw's character. This is a woman ON A MISSION to find out how life started, so she'll never know what it's like to create life. This propels her to ingest the black ooze, something that she thinks will spawn life, resulting in the pregnancy. Only, instead of life, she creates death (the squid monster). Oh shit! Now it must be stopped at all costs.  

7.) Expand on the beginning with the Engineers. This should have been a mind blowing five minute or so intro setting up the black ooze, it spends more time giving us amazing desktop wallpaper and then a lost albino 'Conan' extra with digestive problems than a coherent set-up for the story. 

EDIT: Just had another thought. Imagine Angelina Jolie instead of Noomi Rapace as Dr. Shaw. Now Jolie I can imagine traipsing across the cosmos trying to determine the origin of life. For some reason

Other: You need to be patient and work harder on your screenplay, it’ll just be like a checkpoint, so I’m waiting until I complete my story which will drives me to be more productive.

So... Hi guys! I'm a comic book artist and designer but looking to break into cartoon and live action storyboarding. I don't want to storyboard something that's already been seen (optioned or made movie scripts available online) or have a portfolio full of my own scripts

Anyone want a scene or two storyboarded that they wrote? It would fill my portfolio with your script and your portfolio with my storyboards. 
I'm open to all genres and styles, so please respect that. I don't mind boarding a complete short screenplay as long as it's under 15 minutes. I want variety! Sci fi, westerns, comedy! Something I can show off without being pigeonholed.

**TL;DR: Comic book artist breaking into storyboarding. Will board your script of 15 pages or less for free to build up portfolio. Helps you sell your idea

*Edit: Holy shiznats, and come back to quite a pileup of communications. I honestly didn't expect so many responses in PMs, private emails, and comments here... I will get to everyone within time, so thank you for your patience...*


*Edit II: CineSuppa mentioned signing an NDA below which I think is a wonderful idea. I don't want to infringe on anyone's creative hard work... So BEFORE I read any pages

*Edit III: I found a free NDA [here](http://www.echosign.com/forms/nda.jsp) for anyone who wants to send along their pages. I have responded to the first batch of requests (between everyone, after I'm done, I think it'll be fun to post the results here. Thanks again everyone! This is going to be a lot of fun.*

*Edit IV: Okay- NDAs are a soft spot for some. I don't want to step on anyone's toes which is why I offered them but I've gotten a lot of advice from people on this forum that I'm shooting myself in the foot and limiting MY ability to show this in my portfolio for free work. I'm comfortable without them, I'm open to that too. We can draft our own copy. The one I linked to is a general one. I've also been advised that e-mail transcripts are legal in laying out what's expected of both parties...*

I think I've sorted out the wiki feature now

We get a lot of posts from new writers (which is great) - so it would be nice if we had some decent community resource which will answer all the basic questions (formatting, ideas, structure, etc).

In addition

I don't really want to write it **all** myself (mainly to avoid any bias or unpopular opinions I may have

So how do you think this will work best? There are a few options:

* One option is for you lot to write the major questions in a thread specifically for asking FAQs - and for me to source/write the material and put together a basic draft. And then you can tell me how to improve/rewrite it.

* Another is for us to make a series of 'FAQ Threads'

* Or

None of them is *ideal* - the first doesn't seem like a very neat solution - the second relies on a very flawed voting mechanism and necessitates a lot of wasted writing - and the third relies on a lot of teamwork and is still a select few writing *ex cathedra*.

Perhaps a mix of them would be best - a series of FAQ threads for specific questions

This will be an iterative guide so please if I miss anything just add it in the comments and I will continually update. Perhaps we can add this to the sidebar (or just quietly keep this in your back pocket). 

-------------------

**Google searching**

A great number of scripts can be found through the magic of Google. The trick is knowing how to search for it. I'll give a list of a number of different queries that will give you over 90% success in finding a script if that script is in fact online. I'll use *Pitch Black* as an example. Simply change the script name and otherwise copy the query character for character (without the numbers of course). 

1. *Pitch Black screenplay*

2. *Pitch Black script*

3. *Pitch Black pdf*

4. *Pitch Black file:.pdf*

5. *Pitch Black site:mediafire.com*

6. *Pitch Black pdf site:mediafire.com*

7. *Pitch Black site:sendspace.com*

8. *Pitch Black pdf site:sendspace.com*

9. *Pitch.black.pdf*

10. *Pitch-black.pdf*

11. *Pitch_black.pdf*

12. *Pitch Black Wheat screenplay* 

Tips:

* As seen in step 12, you end up with a much more targeted search (for you science nerds, this increases your search's specificity). You can  trying throwing the word ""download"" in as well.

* Similar to the first bullet above

* Similar to the second bullet above, or some other sites where you learn the *exact* name of the script file. For example, let's say the Pitch Black script pdf was circulating as *PitchBlackscreenplayWheat.pdf*. This is just a fake example, but in that case, you would use quotations and your Google query would read as follows: *""PitchBlackscreenplayWheat.pdf""* &lt;-- be sure to use the quotations. Over time you'll develop a sense of what a ""fake download site"" is and which links are or are not spam. 

**Websites**

Let's try and keep a revolving list of great sites. (I can't vouch for all these sites.)

It was a decidedly ‘meh’ movie. It wasn’t terrible

Anyway

In movies (and TV), Jess and Joanne it always one of two ways:

1.	Joanne gives her blessing for Jim and Jess to be together
2.	Joanne is killed off

Jim and Jess live happily ever after

This is one of the more frustrating bits of bullshit you see in fiction. The love triangle is introduced for the sake of providing conflict on Jim and Jess’ inevitable road to happiness, no-body wants to risk their romantic lead being reviled for needlessly breaking someone’s heart on screen. As much as that is exactly what would have to happen in real life, audiences wouldn’t respond well to it. We wouldn’t want Jim to live happily ever after, not after seeing him reduce Joanne to tears. 

We end up with a false idea about how these things pan out. Without wanting to sound like an interesting person, Jess and Joanne so I can tell you exactly what happens to each of them in the end:

-	Joanne’s heart is broken by someone she cared for, it becomes just another heart-break, but at the time it devastates her because someone she was in love with has basically looked her in the eye and said “you are great, but she’s even better.” That’s about as hurtful as it gets. 

-	Jim feels guilty about what he did to Joanne

-	Jess may or may not know about Joanne’s interest, she’ll become paranoid. At first it’ll be paranoia whenever Jim has to see Joanna, paranoia that he’ll realize he made a mistake and will change his mind on the spot. Then it’ll spread to paranoia about all the women in Jim’s life. She knows that at one point in his life he compared her to someone else and decided on her. Who’s to say he doesn’t compare her to every woman he meets? How long before he compares her to someone who comes out quite favourably? After all, Joanne thought she and Jim were going to be together forever, then along came you.

When the time comes for the love triangle sub-plot to end in real life, she doesn’t suddenly meet her soul mate within 30 seconds of Jim ditching her, and she doesn’t suddenly become philosophical and decide it’s all for the best.

So yes. The Hollywood love triangle

The way it works: we would send each other pages, giving notes to one another.

I would be willing to run 3 different groups if need be: beginners, and writing ability.  The reason for having these groups is that the beginners are not going to be able to learn, or understand, the same things that the professionals do.  The hardest part is determining what group you belong in.  

Beginner is someone who has little to no writing experience.  You don't know where to start

The Advanced group would be people who know how to write and have maybe written their first feature, and how to set up the character arcs.  You don't know how to develop different stories within your script (ie: A Story, B Story, C Story) but are working towards this.

The Professional group would be just that, understand all the concepts of writing, and the concept of story.  They understand how to write dialogue and know the 5 points to a script.  In order to considered for this you must have either IMDB Credits or can demo straight to all the members of this group that you can write.  This is not for the faint of heart as the purpose of this group is to tear your script apart and give you real notes, and real feedback.  You can be kicked out of the group at any time if the members feel that your writing is lacking, if you are not keeping up with your reading or writing, or if they feel that you are becoming a problem for the group.

Please let me know if any of you are interested and what group you are interested in joining.  I would be more than happy to get this going and help run these groups

I've found that I learn more about the craft of screenwriting by reading them than by reading about them in How-To books and such. It's always interesting to see how something written down translates onto the screen. I envision this as a weekly script review as a way to discuss the writing itself--the style, what maybe didn't work--not a movie review (there's plenty of those already).

Every writer seems to have his/her own quirks. For instance, not as something somene wrote hoping to get made. It almost seems like Carpenter already knew beforehand how he would shoot the film, negating the use of heavy description in the script.

Wheras, reads like a mini-novel. There are large blocks of text, and much of the action involves subtext and subtelty. I actually found it slightly easier to follow than the movie. There is little ""We see"" in MD, but it does crop up from time to time.  

Lynch is also amazingly specific, he writes, ""Ray walks into a windowless reception area where a beautiful Italian woman sits behind a large, blonde, modern, built-in desk."" That's a ton of detail for a desk.   

**Edit**: Thanks for the response

After some feedback from mods and others here, but in the meanwhile, we have David Lynch, Naomi Watts, and lesbian sex. Poor us!

1. The dude was old
2. Based on what he told
3. The original screenplay is only one small part of his work, and stuff like that.
4. The number of changes the initial script goes through is mind-blowing.

I took notes

1. How “Black Swan” started. Darren Aronofsky and John McLaughlin worked together on HBO series about hunted houses (still has not been finished) then one day Darren called and asked John McLaughlin about ballet thriller. Why ballet? Because it was an interesting backdrop. Darren had the idea for 5+ years and initially it was set up in theater (if I got it correctly). The draft was already done by somebody else, talked to dancers a lot, attended a lot of rehearsals. So the idea was to show the beauty vs. terror inside a person. When John was working on a script he knew that Natalie will be a lead, she was attached to a project since day 1. The whole process of writing the script went in “circles” (John’s words) as Darren has been working and re-working stuff and they had like tons of drafts. Interestingly, the initial idea was that Natalie will play both roles (Mila’s role) and they also thought that it might go like the aging ballerina (that was played by Winona Ryder ) committing suicide was in fact Natalie, and the movie was the chain of events leading to it. But then they decided it was too cheesy and cliché and decided not to do it.
2. Somebody asked a question how could all male writers write about a female?
John said that it was true and they were trying to find something in common with a character and built on that. Darren’s sister was into ballet and John said that he can definitely identify with Nina’s paranoia. He also mentioned that female driven movie hard to finance.
3. Film school professor asked what was a “log line” for Black Swan? John started to laugh and said “I do not know!” Then he said that they tried to tell a story of a protagonist the public can sympathize with. Ballerinas are unique types of artists who have the shortest career life span. The window of opportunity is very small and at the very young age they already know whether they’ll make it or not. Nina was at the point when her “shelf life” was almost up. She also had very difficult relationships with her mother and even other dancers
They tried to convey “perfectionism” in a dialogue
Darren also wanted her to self-mutilate and be anorexic. Throughout the movie we see a lot of red color and it was John’s intention as he likes to “work with colors” while writing his screenplays. He said he tries to not to be conscious with words because it chokes the progress. Then he mentioned that there is a lot of orange color in Hitchcock’s “Psycho” and it was because Hitchcock himself was on a diet of mainly oranges at the time. 
4. Somebody asked about leg bending scene
5. Somebody asked how many drafts? He said at least 3-4 initial, more like one draft a day as they have been changing a lot of stuff. 
6. John adapts some novels as well and somebody asked about novels adaptations. John: novel just has too much info and his job is to sort out what to leave and what is not worth bothering about. Recently he did an adaptation of non-fiction book on how Hitchcock worked on Psycho. So John’s pitch was to take this book and relate it to the movie as well as to the actual murderer’s life (Psycho was based on real murderer). Hitchcock had a life crisis before Psycho and at the end of the movie Hitchcock was all disillusioned and even pissed because in his view he had been giving his public “champagne” his all life and now he gave them a beer and they like it all the same. However, even though he cuts a lot, he still tries to stay faithful to what novel’s author wanted to convey, the main message. 
7. Somebody asked about different kinds of pressures a screenwriter has to deal with when working on low budget independent movie vs. block buster. John said that pressures are present in both cases
8. Somebody asked if he writes for himself or for his audience? John replied that “I can do what I respond to; you cannot predict what audience will like”. First draft usually has a lot of his writing for himself
9. Somebody asked what was excluded from the “Black Swan” and he thinks it was wrong. John replied that during their research they spent a lot of time in Ballet Theater and discovered very strange sub-culture. There are tons of people hanging around the back stage, know all people by names, always carry with them thick books with photos of each dancer, every program and every autograph, and they keep asking for more autographs. These people creeped out Darren and him, but the scene did not end up in the movie. 
9. Somebody asked about his training
He replied that it is extremely hard to find a screenwriter who likes how profession works. Screenwriters are bitter people
a) Connections. Everybody in Hollywood is a son or a daughter of some celebrity or at least some rich and powerful person. Very tight club
b) Write a lot. And make sure you finish scripts Even if you hate it still finish it regardless. The more you do it the better it gets.
c) Do not be afraid of being screwed. Do not refuse to sell a script for 5000 USD or even for 5. Let them screw you
10. Someone asked how he deals with writer’s block. He usually goes and sees one very BAD movie, that way you can be sure that you’ll write at least something. 

Hope you'll find it interesting.

It will tell you how good you are.

Thus, from at least two readers (paid or otherwise) is what it takes to garner serious attention. I've heard enough success stories already to believe that such attention can pay off, and quickly (i.e. no need for multi-month, automatically renewed hosting, which, for the record, is still my biggest gripe with the site).

Those scripts that are rated 8s and above are getting the heat. So if your script scores a 1 or 2 from a reader you know it's a long way away (or maybe you just need a second opinion at $50 a pop -- though Franklin indicates that almost all reader scores are nearly identical or within 2 ""points"" of each other). So 1s and 2s mean back to the drawing board. A 5 or 6, or 9 -- get thee some Ray-Bans because LA is hella sunny.

Came across this article earlier this week and it got me thinking of how flat my scenes seem to fall. (http://movieline.com/2010/03/23/david-mamets-memo-to-the-writers-of-the-unit/) Really hit on what should be part of a scene, that could help improve someone's ability to write good scenes. Anything that could help in either the development and planning of a scene, or the writing of the scene itself.

Hope this helps out others who are experiencing the same problem I am.

Purely for shits and giggles but I think this would be fun.

**EDIT**: Alright guys well I've messaged the moderators to hopefully get some more people in on this. User [MayorPoopenmeyer](http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/leofq/would_anyone_be_interested_in_a_screenwriting/c2s9l2c?context=3) offered a prize of a ticket to [PitchFest](http://pitchfest.com/index.shtml) next year for a full-length script. I'm trying to organize things on my end before we decide what direction we'll take this in. If we do decide to use the prize then I feel the parameters of the contest should fall on MayorPoopenMeyer. If anyone has any suggestions please message me or comment and let me know. I've never started a contest so bear with me and if anyone feels they can do a better job I am all ears baby.

  
**EDIT 2**: I talked a bit more with user MayorPoopenmeyer and anyone can reach him at Bob@pitchfest.com. Please don't bother him with questions you think I could answer. Wish him luck for his film screening! Tomorrow I'll post a new thread discussing suggestions and the like so we can set up the parameters. I have yet to hear from the mods so hopefully they get back to me soon. Try to think about rules on topics
 
  **EDIT 3**: Well if we go by a panel of judges then Xposting might work against us because we'd have a lot more writers but maybe not so many judges. And if we go by anonymous voting well i don't think some writers would appreciate their work out in the open unprotected. I'll link everyone to the new thread tomorrow. Most likely around noon or a bit afterwards. If someone wants to go ahead and do it before make sure to link everyone in this thread. EVERYONE. We got a good size here and I don't want anyone to miss out.
  
**EDIT 4**: This started as a silly contest but now we have an awesome prize. It's just the ticket so you would need to fond your own lodging and travel but you'll have until next June I believe to save. No one is making money off this and there is not going to be an entrance fee! Well maybe if you're idea gets picked up at PitchFest you stand to make a little money;)

1352087583.0,12neaw,On improving this subreddit,panek,27,3,21,"Hey all

Nice to see folks wanting to improve things. Just responding to state of screenwriting thread so that this response is visible.

* Blogspam. What's your definition of blogspam? Users choose what makes it on the front page through upvoting/downvoting. It's a slippery slope if moderators start deciding which posts become visible. This is one of few subreddits where it's encouraged to promote your own material. I have noticed a few posters posting more frequently than others but they all seem to be posting original content. It might not be of the highest quality but it seems to me like an abuse of power if we started actively blocking what we feel is poor quality. I do remove posts that have no content but it's rare since the spam filter does a pretty good job of blocking true spam. What we remove most are posts requesting scripts without any identifying information (also rare). Redditors also have the ability to label posts as spam though that rarely happens. I have mentioned to some of the frequent posters to try to limit their posting but they control how much they post. 

* ""I personally feel as if this sub should act as a place for screenwriting discussion and also a place for people to submit their work for constructive criticism."" I wasn't aware that this wasn't that. If you want things improved, reading people's scripts and giving constructive criticism and so on. That's the job of everyone not the moderators. A community is only as good as its members. We as moderators used to be more active, for example with the SOTM series, but it fell apart due to lack of participation. Anyone can start a series like that on their own. Just make a post. Such threads are great to enjoy and learn from but someone still needs to own it (i.e., do the hard work). 

* Flair. There was a suggestion for professional-based flair but it seemed kind of purposeless. The professional folk here seem to prefer anonymity (I'm basing this on the many threads that asked if there were any professional writers on this subreddit; of all the responses, how do we verify?). And where do we draw the line (e.g., a production credit is hardly a good measuring stick)? Finally, we already have a flair system and anyone can add whatever they want next to their name (there are pre-set genre tags but you can enter custom text; so professional writers wishing to distinguish themselves can already do so; then again they could be lying). This is my general sense but I could be wrong. 

* AMAs. You want AMAs? Awesome. Find someone to do an AMA. I've asked a few people in my time but had no luck. Anyone can arrange an AMA; if you want it to be visible

* Sidebar. I've updated the sidebar. Any other suggestions? Unfortunately it's limited by word count. What isn't clear about it? It would be great to keep it clean but these issues kept recurring and I feel that the text helps answer recurring questions to some effect. Thoughts?

All that said, champion it, make a thread, then just contact one of us and we'd be happy to help. But that's really all we can do. We have limited powers.

But yeah

*Just remember* -- if you suggest something

EDIT: 

A few action items:

1. Limit blogspam or over-active posters.

2. Remove beginner posts and point them to the common questions thread.

3. Remove ""I just finished my script!"" posts.

4. Find a solution to /r/readmyscript. I propose keeping /r/readmyscript open but having Feedback Fridays on /r/screenwriting where script critiques are posted on Fridays only and are otherwise removed.

5. Add more mods.

6. Write great script.

Every couple of days

And every time, and eliminate future competition, but I really hope r/screenwriting would be a bit more supportive than that.)

So to prevent this from happening

* Figure out exactly what you want out of this post, then say that. If you're looking for some feedback and response, then say that. There is plenty of people ready to give you advice on your script, and discuss the many merits of the craft, but remember that this is NOT a screenwriting school. And no one here is going to hand-held you through it when they have plenty of their own scripts to work on.

*No one here is criticizing you. But we are criticizing your work, then maybe there is something wrong. And we may not always be able to tell you exactly how to fix it, because that's kind of up to you.

*No one here is going to steal your idea/script. Paranoia about other people stealing your ideas is the mark of an amateur screenwriter. If you really feel unsafe about it, or that your script turned into a movie and you can now write an even better one. Everyone here is working on their OWN idea and probably has a whole drawer full of more ideas waiting to be worked on. Your idea is no better than theirs.

That's all I can think of for now. Anyone has anything else they want to add?

1. Ultra sensitivity to those around you

2. A great long term memory. Remembering details about people and the world is necessary to create something that feels real.

3. Something to say.

1327444033.0,ov3hi,Craig Mazin's concept of Central Dramatic Argument,Megakles,23,1,10,"Anyone who's listened to the Scriptnotes podcast will know that Mazin is vehemently against plot structure mechanics as put forth by the various screenwriting gurus.  

I was browsing the [Done Deal Pro](http://messageboard.donedealpro.com/boards/) boards (an awesome resource if you haven't been there)

Mazin explains in the thread that he believes structural mechanics are fine for analyzing screenplays, I think learning from actual, successful screenwriters trumps them any day. 

Anyway


&gt;I begin with questions.

&gt;What is my central dramatic argument? What's the point of the movie?

&gt;How can I show my character in conflict with that in the beginning? How can I make it interesting? Real? Honest? Funny? Broad? Scary? (whatever the tone of the piece demands)

&gt;What would be a dramatically satisfying ending for that character? Who else in his or her life is meaningful?

&gt;Now... what's the most difficult journey from A to B? How can I season that journey with pitfalls and turns? How can I lead them astray, taunt them, scare them? How can the world they're in change and inform them? How will the other characters instruct them, confront them, fail them, betray them?

&gt;I don't worry about page counts

&gt;There are movements that connect theme to character to narrative to relationships.

&gt;I don't care what page any of this **** happens on. That just falls into place once you start thinking about your structure in terms of what your character's true development is over the course of your narrative. I don't care how many things happen. I don't care about nonsense ""pinch points"" or ""middle of the movie revelation"" or any of that crap.

&gt;I just work on torturing my character toward perfection.

&gt;That's my job. I'm God. I'm doing this to my character because the idiot needs me to. It's going to hurt. I want him to curse me, and finally become me.


And further on...


&gt;The importance of this (CDA) isn't pedagogical. We're not lecturing the audience. The importance is that this argument HELPS US FIGURE OUT WHAT TO WRITE AND HOW.

&gt;What should the hero do in the end?

&gt;Why?

&gt;And it's important and interesting because?

&gt;What's the right trap to force him to become something more than he was?

&gt;What kind of ""more""?

&gt;What was his problem to start with?

&gt;Once you understand that the CDA of Nemo is ""parents must let their children go

&gt;1. It was a GOOD CHOICE to kill Marlin's wife and all his kids but one.
&gt;2. It was a GOOD CHOICE to make Nemo handicapped.
&gt;3. It was a GOOD CHOICE to pair Marlin with a character who can't remember anything.
&gt;4. It was a GOOD CHOICE to have Marlin find Nemo *before* the actual climax.
&gt;5. It was a GOOD CHOICE to create a climax in which the protagonist only had one single thing to do

&gt;These good choices aren't there because they're fun or exciting

&gt;Everything in the movie, each and every time, in an incredibly consistent manner.

&gt;Point being: I don't point this out so we can all pull our puds while diagramming movies in a brand new way.

&gt;I point this out because this will help you WRITE a movie with intention and structure related to DRAMA and CHARACTER and PHILOSOPHICAL INTENTION as opposed to MECHANICS and EXPECTATIONS and CONVENTION.


So, is what will help you write an engaging story. So something like ""friendship"" or ""hope"" is not a CDA - it should be a statement, your position on something.  ",,False,self,t5_2qupf,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/ov3hi/craig_mazins_concept_of_central_dramatic_argument/

Congratulations!  You have a chance to join the greatest writing group ever devised.  Kudos you!

This writing group is not like others.  This group isn't a social club

The group will meet on Sundays at 7:00 @ the Stir Crazy coffee shop (6903 Melrose Ave

Our first meeting will be a meet and greet this Sunday (July 15th), and the concept are to your liking.

The rules are simple:

1.  Once the group starts
2.  Each member is responsible for reading everyone else's pages by the meeting.
3. Should a member fail to meet their obligations

The purpose of the group and the rules are to ensure that everyone has a carrot to motivate them (discipline and a captive audience for their imagined world) and a consequence for failing.  Skill level here is less important than in other groups, and on task.

MEMBERS SO FAR:

I'm looking for a partner so that I can learn and progress more efficiently as a screenwriter. A little about me:

- Graduating from college very soon and starting a full time job right after
- Passionate about film since young age but only recently decided to take the plunge into screenwriting
- I've read two screenwriting books and written a (shitty) half of my first feature length
- Friendly, and have been told I'm a great team mate

As for what I'm looking for a partner, and that natural talent will always get overshadowed by mindset and hard work. And also, I live in LA, so if we have great synergy then we can always meet up and hang out, have weekend writing sessions, etc.

Basically, give honest feedback on each others work,  and overall just find another person who loves watching and writing film. We would keep in contact over e-mail, skype, text, whatever mediums as long as we are a good fit both personally and artistically.

Please private message me if you want to grow as a screenwriter and need a partner!

Edit: Really appreciate the upvotes

I went to UCLA for the Film Program but I didn't know how hard it was to get in (15 people per year, including a screenwriting class based on Walter's Screenwriting book.

I've also written around 40 pages of my first feature length, reading scripts, and forming my game plan.

You have until **THURSDAY APRIL 11TH** to submit your completed screenplays to the 2013 r/Screenwriting Screenplay Contest.

*[Original announcement post with full submission details is [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1a32wd/announcement_rscreenwriting_screenplay/)]*

Email your pdfs (with personal information removed

The contest is entirely **free to enter**, and we have about a dozen entries so far. (As an aside: - it's still worth entering even if you can't get to Pitchfest this year - Bob has said you can defer your ticket until next year, or even donate it to another winner who is able to go).

A post by last year's winner about his experience at Pitchfest is in the original announcement link.

The contest is open to **any finished screenplay** of any (reasonable) length in any genre.

We're still looking for a couple of extra judges - so if you feel qualified

You still have ten days! Good luck to all who have already entered - I'll be confirming your entries by email very soon.

If you have any questions at all

**EDIT:** -- I realise I should probably have posted this yesterday to avoid doing it on April 1st ...

I've been a marketing communications manager (re: copywriter) for 7 years, I'm on salary.) I'm an indie filmmaker as well, currently working on co-producing a Latino coming of age film, and though I've edited the script, I didn't write it. So I know about shots, compositing, etc.  

What do I need to do *now* to make screenwriting a full-time, though I am willing to relocate to NYC or Southern California (Southern cali preferred).  I'm also willing to consider going to film school.  University of Texas at Austin has a screenwriting MFA, but it takes two years, and they only accept 7 people per year.  

One program that looks interesting is the UCLA Professional Program in Screenwriting (Online.)  It can be done in an academic year

http://www.filmprograms.ucla.edu/index.cfm?action=os_pps&amp;side=os

$4500 is CHEAP compared to a 2-year Masters program.  So

To be specific

A) To be able to make at least $3500/mo before taxes screenwriting.  That's what I need to keep the mortgage paid
B) To be eligible for WGA membership

Keep in mind

-------------------

**UPDATE**

Okay

My new plan is to finish up some things here in Austin, I'll try to get some sort of internship or PA job or something, and take the classes at night.  I'll return to Austin on April 1, 2013, and re-evaluate my plans. Next September, I'll take the online screenwriting class, but with no other pretentions other than becoming a better

My dream/goal is to write a sitcom styled TV show; like, but he's darn good when it comes to *appreciating and understanding* movies - and what makes movies great. We've always shared the same (and IMO, great) taste in movies, but it wasn't until I sat down and watched movies with him and commentated on them, did I really notice this. 

Now I know everyone says that there's a bunch of crap on TV and that they could write a much better show given the chance and blah blah blah, *I can write a much better show than the crap that's on TV now!* 

All this being said, I felt like this was the funniest thing ever - and that's why I needed to just set it aside and walk away from it. I reread it about half a year later and hated *every. last. word.* of it. It was horrible.

So I rewrote it; changed characters, locations, keeping some things here and there. After awhile we looked it over again and... rewrote it again. We finally rewrote it a third time and absolutely loved it. It had glimpses of The Office, Seinfeld, IASIP, and Modern Family in it. I went back and looked it over after a couple of months and I actually still loved it, so I started to rewrite the pilot into a screenplay format. 

Last week, quite honestly. So I made Guy 1 and Girl 1 married, and living together. I also made Girl 1 pregnant which gave me a reason for Girl 2 (who's now a mid wife) to come live with them. This then allowed me to make Guy 2 and Guy 3 live together, which helps me incorporate and solidify Guy 3 as a main  (or at least a supporting) character, instead of just a 'reoccurring' one. 

So I'm now currently *re*writing the screenplay for the pilot

A truism of Hollywood, in anonymized format, nearly got a graphic novel made.](http://i.imgur.com/iCy4w.jpg)  It's for a script that was commissioned by a production company (for enough money to make me ineligible for screenwriting contests, thank god) whose option has lapsed and which I'm currently converting to a novel, based on the advice and counsel of a NYT-bestselling author.  No you may not read the script or the novel, thanks for asking, I'm flattered, however, know that it isn't the 1-sheet.  It's the script.  Start over.

*  *   *  

A 1sheet, the purpose is to leave them wanting to read it.  

It must, slick, and confident.  It must give your reader the impression you know what you're doing, you've written a kick-ass story, and at a bare minimum, they won't regret giving it (and you) an hour or two of their time.  Remember - anyone who actually has the power to nudge your script *an inch* closer to production is *buried* under screenplays.  You aren't in their stack yet.  This document you're about to craft is the tool you're going to use to shove yourself to the head of the line.  Keep that in mind: your goal is to step on the faces of several dozen other screenwriters as you scratch and claw your way to the top.  Now is not the time to be coy, now is not the time to be demure.  One foot in the gutter

Hollywood is the uneasy intersection of art and commerce.  So is the 1-sheet.  You're telling a story about a story and you're doing it in such a way to indicate that untold riches lie in wait for those willing to believe in the tale you're about to tell.  As such, it is one of locations.  Theme does not matter.  Casting does.  The 1-sheet is where you take that long, hard look at your script and find all the marketable gems so that your reader doesn't have to.  Can't find any?  Start over.  You've written a script.  Congratulations.  **Now you have to sell it.**

Start with the title.  I put my company logo in the upper left because I do this on my stationery.  Everything I do I do on stationery because the stuff I send out is generally not the first thing people see from me.  May you be as lucky.  The big block

Know how you write everything in CourierFD?  Yeah, you haven't thought about it?  Bullshit.  You dream about it at night.  We all do.  

**This is the first place you can lose your audience.** Don't give them any excuses.

Below the title you put your logline.  Know all the tricks they tell you about coming up with a kick-ass logline?  Use them.  

**This is the 2nd place you can lose your audience.** Don't give them any excuses.

Immediately below is the paragraph synopsis.  Note that it leaves a lot of shit hanging.  Should you eradicate all mystery

**This is the 3rd place you can lose your audience.**  Don't give them any excuses.

So now you have their attention.  They've read your title, they're still here.  Now you give them a basic journey through the arc of the script - NO SPOILERS.  Again, you're giving them a taste and leaving them wanting more.  End on a teaser.  

**This is the 4th place you can lose your audience.** Don't give them any excuses.

Now we get into the sausage-making.  What kind of movie is this.  Where can you see it being shot.  Who is likely to be in it.  What other movies are like it.  PICK SUCCESSFUL MOVIES.  Nobody cares about your GATTACA-meets-SKY CAPTAIN crossover - both movies lost money hand over fist and if you seek to emulate them you will find no one wants to spend money on your ideas.  Many of my 1sheets contain guesses at budget - ""sag indie"" ""ultra-low-budget"" ""conventional studio budgets"" etc.  You likely don't know what your movie will cost but you know if it's a $10m or $100m film

Below that is your contact info.  Don't put the WGA number or anything stupid like that.  Don't put ""available on request.""  Of course it is. Put your name (I don't

Oh

*  *   * 

I can't emphasize this enough:  This is **A** format, so use some creativity and come up with your own.  You can probably beat the tar off of mine.  Give it a shot.  Be creative.  Use another font for once in your life and revel in it.

Let's fund it via Kickstarter. There are a

[projects](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/muffinbuds/muffinbuds?ref=category)
getting funded.

But we need a killer script first. I've started on a [pilot episode script](http://www.scribd.com/doc/83754737). But it's just the story structure with a lot of placeholder dialog; and mainly

Is it possible for just a few people to animate and voice an entire 22 minute sitcom?
Yes. [This is a sitcom](http://www.uni-form.co.uk/) produced by just five people (two really). Technically, it just doesn't have that Joke Per Minute rate that keeps you watching. But it just shows you what you can do.

So

1. Have separate story lines that eventually collide resulting in a mind-bendingly funny confrontation/situation at the end.

2. Have a high JPM (Joke Per Minute) rate (i.e. Big Bang Theory style
[simple gags](http://thedoghousediaries.com/comics/uncategorized/2012-01-25-ef4f1f8.png). But keeping them coming is the key. 

3. Be realistic - just like a live action show - it just so happens that it's animated. Think of any animated show (Family Guy, so it's very relatable.

So once we have that script written

How do we actually animate it?
Some stats:

- Each Community episode takes about $1 million dollars to produce. Can't do that!

- Each Simpsons

- One ""sitcom"" has cracked the code for cheap production though: It takes ten people less than one week to produce each South Park episode. But it looks a bit... childish.

- There's a nice middle ground with Archer ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archer_(TV_series) ) though. Each takes a couple of months to produce and look great.

- There are many [online](http://www.wreckamovie.com/) [efforts](http://studios.amazon.com/) to create movies

- Another possibility is to actually have it live-action, them in front of greenscreens - the internet's first sitcom that's not awful!

- I say we find a nice middle ground of the animation. I quite like [this combo CG/drawn style](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/537261515/least-i-could-do-the-pilot)

What if we all decided on a short story in the public domain

It would give everyone a short-term goal that they could potentially keep for their portfolios

Any interest? 

**[Edit]**

**There's interest!** Okay

1. I think length should be 5-20 pages. If we did full-length scripts, anyway. 

2. A lot of people didn't realize that I meant for us to all adapt the same existing short story. I think this would be best for seeing the choices we all made as screenwriters with form, I would be most interested in doing this if we're literally adapting an existing story.

3. It has been suggested that people might steal each others' ideas if we do what I outlined above. This is a common fear amongst screenwriters in writing groups, second drafts across the board might start looking alike. In my opinion, we should be able to trust each other not to adopt the more *original* variances of other adaptations into our own. Besides, it would take one of us actually producing the short for that to matter anyway; however, if we're not considering actually doing something with our scripts, why use something in the public domain from Project Gutenberg?

4. So we could decide to adapt the same *non*-public domain story

5. We could follow troublef's idea and all create original works based on the same basic story/setting/conflict outline that we make up as a group.

We need judges!,,21,6,73,"So I requested to start a small silly screenwriting contest [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/leofq/would_anyone_be_interested_in_a_screenwriting/) but it quickly covered ground. User [MayorPoopenmeyer](http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/leofq/would_anyone_be_interested_in_a_screenwriting/c2s7rnz) offered a reward of a ticket to [PitchFest](http://pitchfest.com/index.shtml) for next year for the winner on the grounds that it has to be a feature-length screenplay. It would only be the ticket to PitchFest so you would have to pay your own lodging and travel but it's not until next year so the winner could start saving early!

So far we've decided on it being open topic
 
So for a deadline I was thinking 8 weeks. If you think that's too short or too long please voice your opinion.**EDIT**: The crowd favorite seems to be 12 weeks. I'll leave it like that for now.

For judging we wanted at first to post all the scripts anonymously somewhere and have the community vote on them but that might not be the smartest move. So I think we're set on a panel of judges alongside MayorPoopenmeyer who will read the scripts and possibly use a simplified version of [Script Coverage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_coverage) to judge them.
  
 We'll need a way for the judges to choose the winner easily. Maybe they can each read a few and chose their favorite
  
I think that's all so far. Please post suggestions

**EDIT**: I'm debating Xposting this to r/writing and r/movies. It would gather a lot more attention but it might make it unmanageable. What do you think? I xposted to r/ReadMyScript and r/Filmmakers already. EDIT: I've xposted to r/writing.

**EDIT 2**: I think it would be alright if you submitted a script you've already written so long as it has not garnered any awards. What's your opinion?

**SO FAR** it seems it's going to be 12 weeks. 90-120 pages seems to be the agreed amount but they're not definitive. A panel of 5 judges sounds good. So far we have the host of our prize and two other volunteers have stepped up. I'll run them by our judge. I think the preferred method would be in a pdf format. You can use celtx

**UPDATE** So we got a runner up prize of a judge running consultation on your screenplay and providing notes so far. I'm in the process of looking for something else. I'm going to crosspost this to r/movies and see if we can grab some more folks. I will keep you all updated!

  
**UPDATE2** Nothing new to report as of Sunday 10/23. I'm still waiting on some emails. I'll be doing a X-post to r/movies on Monday. Get your brainstorming and your character sheets or whatever you use to help you write ready. I want this thing started by the end of the week.

**UPDATE3** Hi guys. I hope everyone is still interested. I'm having a busy week but I'm still working hard on trying to contact everyone!

So, came up with a concept for a TV show he wanted written. He is not a writer and approached me about helping him out. Being interested in the idea and wanting to be involved, I wrote a TV pilot and registered it with the Writers Guild under my name (I have a ""written by"" and ""story by"" credit while Idea Guy has a ""story by"" credit)

Through random providence, and now wants to work with us on making it. The director is known in Hollywood, so he'll be the one putting together the package and shopping it to networks. Since my name carries zero weight, he's also looking to attach a name writer to the project to better sell it and says he has several candidates lined up. He's asked me to sign a ""standard writer's contract"" with Idea Guy from whom director will also obtain Chain of Title.

The contract he's put together is titled ""Screenwriter Work-For-Hire Agreement"" and is to be an agreement between myself and Idea Guy. I'd like to sign it

In the clauses below, the Writer.

Clause 1: *Conditioned upon Writer’s full performance of his/her obligations hereunder, fixed compensation in the amount of FIVE HUNDRED CAD DOLLARS (CAD $500), payable upon execution of this Agreement. The Writer acknowledges that as of the signing of this agreement, the Writer has been compensated in full and has no other monetary claims against the Producer.*

Clause 2: *Writer acknowledges and agrees that the results and proceeds of Writer's services hereunder and any and all material, ideas, gags, or dialogue or other matter written, composed, prepared, submitted, or its preparation or production (collectively, be deemed the sole author thereof and shall have the right to obtain copyright therefor and for the Picture in its own name or otherwise

Clause 3: *Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, are deemed not to be a “work made for hire” under the United States and Canada copyright law, Writer acknowledges and agrees that by the terms hereof, Writer hereby irrevocably grants, sets over and assigns to Producer throughout the universe, exclusively and in perpetuity, free and clear of any and all claims, all right

First off

Secondly, any additional writing fees (as mandated by the Writers' Guild) in the event a studio decides to go forward with the project. I was told by the director that because I have ""written by"" and ""story by"" credits to my name, I'm protected in that regards, but I want to be 100% sure. While the ultimate goal is to get a job working on this project, should it be produced, I'd also like to receive some compensation for all the work I've put in.

Does anyone have any experience with this? Can you tell me if these clauses will screw me? And if so

Edit to add:
&gt;Techdirt reported that due to Reddit's licensing terms, and that Reddit itself may own rights to those portions of the story created and shared on their website. While the concept of modern military forces involving themselves in conflicts with less advanced cultures is a common theme in science fiction, in order to claim exclusivity, Erwin may be required to rewrite the story to remove those portions created through input of Reddit users.[2][10][11]
Reddit have since made a statement that the licensing terms are there to protect them from potential legal action and that they do not intend to block the production of the movie.[12]

I'll start:

While reading a script I co-wrote which desired some additional conflict

Although I'm no expert, but it's also a sticky mess (like giving birth, for instance). Now I would have to consider the ROOMMATES wants and needs within the story, along with adequate moments of exposition. That is already taking up a lot of space in my narrative and I haven't even reached the conflict yet! A character brought in for the hell of it (similar to a roommate) may only add more fat to trim later.

**UPDATE:** [HERE](http://i.imgur.com/MzJMrDP.jpg) is the proof you all asked for! 

I am working for newly formed

The company is co-founded by [Sara Risher](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0728260/)  (producer of the Nightmare on Elm Street series

We plan on producing a number of feature films

We are now officially accepting screenplay submissions. If you have a story to tell

We guarantee that every submission will be read! If we decide it has potential
________________________

**Notes/Tips/Rules**

1. We are a brand new company. You will not any find any information on us online. Our website is set to launch within the next few weeks.
2. Feature length screenplays are preferred over shorts or treatments.
3. Every submission will be read. Sending the same work in multiple times will not change our verdict.
4. If you do not hear from us within a few weeks
5. If you do resubmit your work

I read a lot of scripts. I will probably read some of your submissions. Here are my tips:

* 90 pages is a good length for a screenplay. If it's longer than 90
* The fate of your submission rests in the hands of an unpaid intern. If said intern thinks your work is good enough, THEY WILL NOT READ FURTHER THAN PAGE 10! If he/she does not like you, they will heartlessly decimate your best shot at making it into Hollywood! So proof-read your work, and keep our interns happy :)

**TL; DR- Send us scripts. If yours is good,False,self,t5_2qupf,False,,,t3_1kb5tj

There are subs that have certain loyalist fans, much to everyone else's joy.

The point of this rant is simple: This subreddit, angry and downright whiny subs I've ever come across. The large chunk of what get's contributed here is people moaning about how this is not up to their standards or how they were ""scarred"" by this awful film. How this film caused the end of the world and how that script made their eyes bleed. As a fellow screenwriter, having to come in to see how my peers are living their lives, it's quite frankly depressing. I found myself thinking ""I want to say something but I know they'll probably deconstruct and then hate that as well"".

I just don't know if I could follow through with writing a screenplay that portrays, in a negative way. He's not a bad guy, but there are things he did that affected me negatively. And to any of my family members, it would be glaringly obvious that I was writing about him. That would definitely be a big blow to his feelings.

How do you deal with that? I believe writing from the heart is important. But I also can't imagine what it would be like to portray someone close to you in a negative light and then confront them afterwards (if they read your screenplay or it was produced).

I will email a receipt to everyone who has already submitted theirs

(If you've submitted

As far as judging is concerned

**All the scripts will be read in full.** From Friday morning, and then discuss any differences properly, before coming to a final decision.

* **1st prize** is the free ticket to [Pitchfest](https://pitchfest.com/)! (I'll inform the winner by email before posting the results here

* **2nd and 3rd prize** will be a few pages of free coverage on your script. Hopefully explaining why it didn't quite win

I'll be dedicating a large proportion of the next fortnight to reading and scoring them all (we have 23 so far, just to keep you informed of how things are going.

Unfortunately, after all.)

However - I *will* be posting a round-up of all the scripts when we announce the winners. I'll go through the various criteria we used for judging - hopefully point out any common mistakes, etc. That way, I hope everyone will benefit in some way from entering.

I think that's it. 

Deadline is tomorrow! We're looking forward to reading them! 

Good luck!

No worries. Just get it done as you have to start somewhere.

At the moment I am basking in the glow of completion, Field, Volger, Largo et al.  As I was writing it I noticed the huge discrepancy between pure story they advocate and the absolute bollocks you see in cinemas at the moment.  I didn't care.  Fuck Hollywood.  I just wrote a story that I thought was interesting and imagined shit I wanted to see.

So a few non-pro tips:

Just write a version.  Then rewrite it.  I outlined about twenty different versions to get to the one I liked.

Dialogue was 'on the nose' for the first few passes but when you rewrite you can make it subtle and add subtext.  Don't fret that it's bad on the first few tries.

Themes change as you rewrite so don't let that be a block.

I am a freelance DP in the Boston area looking for a talented writer/director to work with. Weekdays, I have a professional crew that I have assembled over the last 10 years.
I've been assembling some short film shoots but my main contact list of directors/writers/creatives have mostly all moved to LA and Austin ([Paul Cummings](http://www.youtube.com/user/Tetriscide?ob=0&amp;feature=results_main), and [Ryan Morrison](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLNcb_ls8p0)).
I have technicians around me that want to work with me as crew
We have a steadicam owner/operator, [Nuke/Roto guru](http://vimeo.com/user435047), and quite a few amazing grips/electrics/gaffers that I know from my lighting experiences in IATSE.

Estimated start time: 11pm Eastern (for the math challenged, 8pm pacific (UK, AUS, NZ folks...please adjust accordingly)

Tonight -- 08-07-13 **A one time only post** to say thanks for all the collective hours put in by some great writers who took it upon themselves to conquer the blank page. 

**FOR WRITERS:** A contest (with very low stakes). One month of Reddit Gold to the most popular script. 

The rules are simple:

1. If you write
 
1. Can't vote for yourself.
  
1. Since it's against this sub's rules to solicit reviews (which is why there are no rules about reviewing)
 
1. This time and this time only
  
1. In the event of a tie
 
**FOR DOWNVOTERS:** hehe, I want to hear what you have to say! Just on a courtesy level would love to see if there're any tweaks that can be made that wouldn't diminish your experience on /r/screenwriting. Am a good listener, so give me the opportunity to walk in your shoes. Post a comment or PM me. Make a compelling case from anything to a general, ""go fuck yourself"", or a ""it's just not my thing"". Give a compelling (non-troll) reason, and you may find yourself in possession of a free month of reddit gold! If you don't win, at least take heart that somebody out there cares what you think.  

**Good writing and hope to see you here!**

Any and everyone should meet here and we all get a random premise and a random word. We then have 60 minutes to write a 3-5 page script with as few or as many characters as you like. The finished scripts are then uploaded to scribd.com and the links posted (as a new comment) back here.

Scripts will be the posted in the order they are finished.

To keep things honest the script should begin

Beyond that

Since we all have the same premise and the same limitations

This post will be updated with the random word and topic after they are selected. See you then!

**** If one were to develop a checklist of points to tick off and consider

Let's say that every script should have a beginning, say 'ohhhh!' to each other, followed by a headshake and a smile and 'shoulda seen that coming...' and that last part in a good way.

A screenplay should have a relationship and that relationship should move in time or counter-time to the plot. Your hero should have a gf or bf and their relationship should be either strengthened or weakened by the events in the plot; the relationship should be seen as a 'canary in a coalmine', his gf breaks up with him. That does a lot for him, allows him to grow and change, frees him to become a new person, etc.) This leads to-

Getting on that path alerts the antags that now THEY are in jeopardy, leading them to step up their efforts to stop the protag- but now our protag has a plan and the reader wants to see that plan, how it works, how it adapts.

There should be antagonists who/that are appropriately powerful enough to present a real threat to the protag. These antags should be on multiple levels and at increasing levels of danger. By fighting them

Estimated start time: 7pm Eastern (for the math challenged, 4pm pacific (UK, AUS, NZ folks...adjust accordingly) 

Today -- 07-22-13 Any and everyone should meet here and we all get a random premise and a random word. We then have 60 minutes to write a 3-5 page script with as few or as many characters as you like. The finished scripts are then uploaded to scribd.com and the links posted back here.

Scripts will be the posted in the order they are finished (which means statistically the first one done tends to get the most views and possibly giving the writer an edge in votes).

To keep things honest the script should begin

Beyond that

After that we read each others scripts and invite the community to vote. Since we all have the same premise and the same limitations

1373845174.0,1iayw8,The Purge [2013] - (plot / story / theme) analysis - SPOILERS,archonemis,17,5,3,"I'll break this down into initial thoughts on viewing and then a brief description of the plot elements that caught my attention and then I'll end it with ideas on strengths it had and weaknesses; with possible solutions to the weaknesses.

**1.) Initial thoughts.**

The premise itself, but the vast majority of violence is done by a very small group and type of people. The average person will avoid violence at all cost.

I like how in the very beginning Ethan Hawk says, home again, jiggety jig."" I'm willing to bet that wasn't in the screenplay and was adlibbed on set by Ethan. This is a line in Blade Runner and, I assume, an oblique reference to dystopian fantasies i general. A nice toss-off.

I like how it begins like Shirley Jackson's ""The Lottery"" where everything is hyper normal and rather bland. They just accept it without question. 

Of the characters in the beginning you can almost tell which ones will be enemies later on in the film. The way they smile and pat each other. I know this is supposed to be a drama and all, though. I know there are only so many ways to do this and I just think the path the writers took lacked finesse. 

I like the links to socio-economics. The premise has the ring of Randian / psychopathic dominance. It's nice to see that the writers took it to the next level and thought through some of the implications of free crime for a day. Wealth redistribution indeed. And at gunpoint.

The fake-out with the boyfriend was a nice touch. It was sort of obvious, capable of violence. It was also a nice way of showing how devious the behavior gets during the purge. That said, the boyfriend's reasoning is pretty retarded. I mean, from a character standpoint, it makes no sense. I think this is just lousy writing. I can't believe that he'd actually think that murdering his girl friend's father would make her anything but hostile toward him. Could you imagine someone killing your father and then assuming you'd be having sex with that person? I think this interaction could've been saved, but the execution was poor.

Okay

I'd also like to add that Game Theory would clearly and simply state that you simply do not allow the roving gang inside. You keep the walls up. The idea is that you can't trust them. If you keep the bloody stranger they'll kill you. If you open the doors they'll likely kill you. So there's no benefit to doing what they tell you. I would simply ally myself with the bloody stranger and formulate a Straw Dogs style plan.

Incidentally

The bloody stranger is a wasted character. He serves the purpose of getting the father to become more and more violent / immoral. First the father kills the boyfriend and then he tortures the bloody stranger. He was going to sacrifice a human life i order to protect his family. Which is all fine and well

Now that I think about it

Anyway

I'm of the opinion that this was a great premise that could've been used / exploited / executed way better.

**2.) Brief description of plot elements.**

I think this was written with the normal three act structure in mind. I think this is the case because it has the standard lack of focus and act two malaise. I'll go ahead and look at it from the three act structure perspective since that's very likely how it was written:

Act 1: Set up story world and characters

We meet the family and the villains in one clean sweep. With a description of the night we're about to watch.

Act 2: The night begins.

Minutes after Purge Night begins the boyfriend initiates his own vengance against the father. At the same time a bloodied stranger enters the house.

Mid-act Climax

The people from whom the bloody stranger ran arrive. They give an ultimatum to the father.

The father declines.

Act 3: World 8-4 / princess in peril

The father kills a bunch of gang members. The polite leader kills the father. The neighbors try to kill the rest of the family. The bloody stranger saves the family.

Resolution: No violence is permitted

. . .

That was fucking sloppy.

Just awful.

**3.) Weaknesses with possible solutions.**

The ending kills the father who, running and squibs.

Frankly I thought it was uninteresting.

The kids could have been great protagonists, but she was also left to the side. At the end she did make the rather heroic gesture of choosing non-violence. I think this is one of the better bits of writing, but it wasn't set up at all and ultimately came off as just some more random meaningless bull. And the bloody stranger. He could've been a neat character too. He wasn't just hanging out. He was out there and doing things from the get go. But he was dropped during the entire first part of act three. He just magically showed up at just the right time - missing only a white horse and a saber.

Solutions

1.) Pick a godamn main character and give that character something to do. Simply putting people in situations and then assuming that it's a movie is a waste of fucking time and energy.

In the existing movie the mother goes the peace route

They had a good story-world

The story world involved violence. The end involved a movement toward non-violence. I would have made the main character a Purge enthusiast. And then I would have had that character experience the violence on a personal level. And then I would have had that character empathize with someone against whom he commits violence. Thus making the peace solution properly impactful.

It's not that they should've picked one character over another to be a protagionst; it's that they didn't have a protagonist at all. None of the characters

The solution: 

Design an action that goes along with and then diametrically opposes the story world values. Have a single character perform this action. 

2.) The philosophies were not really explored.

They were discussed in exposition, but since all of the characters were completely flat and little decision making was happening it was just another meaingless piece within a larger pile of meaningless stuff.

Solution:

Show decision-making within the context of how this violence would effect relationships after the Purge. This is hinted at in the final scene. Otherwise it's an unused tool begging to be picked up and examined. Which is a shame. Going in this direction would have shown exactly how violence impacts society. It's never the 'In The Moment' stuff that resonates. It's what happens afterward that makes it relevant.

The reason the characters were flat and uninteresting was because they weren't really deciding to do things and their value sets weren't really in question at any point. I would have deleted all of the characters and plot points and started from scratch. The story world is interesting enough that I would have done everything possible to use it.

You want good characters? Have a good action to be performed. One character. One goal. Your character wants to do one fucking thing and that's all he or she wants to do. Now block that thing and force your character to have to overcome whatever is keeping them from reaching their goal. Move mountains if need be

Over-all: Not bad if you have a six pack and a night to kill.

Particularly if you like to MST3K your movies.
