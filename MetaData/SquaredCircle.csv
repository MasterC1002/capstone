1371615131.0,1gmugo,"Just watched Bryan and Orton again, in light of the news, and this is what I picked up: a long read, but it's really fascinating how it went down, and what Orton did to protect his opponent.",765,"Like most of you, but I wanted to go back and see what I could pick up. 

It seemed like a work to me last night (although the finish seemed odd to me

Bryan was clearly injured after the missile dropkick, a commercial break, and Bryan continuing to act normal. Lawler is talking about how the dive looked like it hurt Bryan, but it's just the normal selling of a big move. 

After the commercial, but it doesn't look like Bryan lands in a weird way. Although when you look at how he always lands from one of those--flat on his back, instead of rotating and landing on his front--it is a pretty big bump to take. 

Bryan's laying there, as you see him very clearly reach over and squeeze Bryan's leg. I guess this was a ""You ok?"" gesture. 

Bryan eventually gets up, and he's trying to work through it. He seems to be okay mentally, but his left arm is just hanging at his side. For those who don't know what a stinger is, his nervous system is basically shocked, and he's presumably lost feeling in his arm. 

He starts kicking Orton, since the sound gets muted, but I think it was ""What the fuck?""

Bryan ends up on the apron for the ""Vintage Orton"" DDT, and they go through a ""No Lock"" sequence. 

Orton slingshots Bryan to the apron, and Orton kicks him to the floor. This is where Lawler really starts talking about how it looks like Bryan has ""lost some feeling in his upper body.""  I'm assuming everyone now knows Bryan has a stinger, and they're telling Lawler in his headset to sell it, because they're either going to call the match, or will need some time to sort things out.  

The ref blocks Orton from coming outside, and is noticeably angry. He yells something at the doctor I can't hear, and you see the doctor nodding his head, like ""Too bad, I'm stopping it.""  Bryan then gets up and runs past him. 

The doctor is very obviously surprised by this...he's kind of reaching out towards Bryan, I'm definitely calling it.""

Bryan immediately starts wailing on Orton, follows him out, and does a belly to back suplex on the barricade...which you'd think would be a tough move to take, but it looks like Orton is the one taking all the impact.  Mind you, this all happens *very* fast.  

Orton then puts his hands up in a ""What was I supposed to do"" gesture. The ref and the doctor both lean over Bryan, who looks angry. They cut back and forth between Bryan and Orton, and when the camera zooms out, there's several referees standing nearby. I'm guessing they ran out to stop Bryan if he tried to start up again. 

Sorry for the wall of text--maybe I'm the only one who's interested in this sort of thing

What I found most interesting is the role Orton played.  I've never been a big Orton fan, and after the doctor tried to call it off, he immediately improvised a move that was totally safe for Bryan, and also looked painful enough on camera that would give the ref and doctor another opportunity to stop the match. Orton then went over and hugged Bryan, talking to him quietly at the same time.  He really acted like a professional here, and a guy who knew exactly what to do in order to protect the guy he was in the ring with. 

As for Bryan, we're still talking about a guy who continued to wrestle after he detached his own retina. At any rate, I'm glad he's okay, and I hope no one backstage was angry with him for trying to keep going, or for going off on HHH. Right or wrong, you've got to admire his commitment.

EDIT: Thanks for the positive comments. I wasn't sure if anyone else was as interested in what happened as I was. I'd encourage everyone to go back and take another look at the later parts of the match--it really is a fascinating look at the passion some guys have,False,,t5_2sljg,1371616320.0,,wwfoldschool c134,t3_1gmugo

* Following Armageddon, and Triple H pinned Goldberg to become the World Champion. Evolution had conquered Raw.

* Triple H was feuding with Benoit \(the 2004 Rumble winner\) and HBK for the WHC on the Road to Wrestlemania XX. [This left Evolution to feud with...](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l7OB_KecAAhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l7OB_KecAA).

Last night, however, they just mentioned that the crowd was, in fact, humming Fandango's theme. No spin, no angle, just pointing out that the crowd was having fun.

Ladies and Gentlemen, they are allowing the WWE Universe to be the centerpiece of a show when they damn well deserve to be. This mentality may also lead to Fandango *at least* becoming a cult classic in the vein of Val Venis and D-Lo Brown.

EDIT 2: I didn't include info on ROH, and secondly because I just don't know enough to make a post this long, and there's such a revolving door of talent in the indies that it would take FOREVER. 

***So who's this John Cena guy I'm always hearing about?*** 

-John Cena (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cena) is, shortly turned heel and developed a white rapper gimmick, based on Vanilla Ice. In his meteoric rise to the top, Cena ran programs up against industry greats like Kurt Angle, Chris Jericho, Brock Lesnar, and even the Undertaker. He defeated the Big Show in his first WrestleMania appearance in 2004. By the same time next year, he was drafted to Raw and has since become a 13-time world champion, Edge, which the Great One won. However

***Did WWE have any major factions?*** 

If you watched WWE during the Attitude Era, and occasional in-ring veteran. Dave ""The Animal"" Batista was brought in as the rookie ""muscle"" of the group, followed by the up-and-coming Randy Orton (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Orton) as the young blue-chipper seen as the future of the company. During this time, Orton developed his ""Legend Killer"" gimmick, where he would start feuds with WWE Hall of Famers and other legends, in order to defeat or humiliate them, thus ending their legacy and building his own. The group lasted until 2005, but when Orton refused to surrender the title to him, effectively ended the reign of Evolution. 

***You mentioned Chris Benoit. What's the deal with that guy?*** 

Chris Benoit (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Benoit) is one of the greatest pure professional wrestlers in the history of the business. He worked in WCW but came over to WWE and after years of working the mid-card, police were alerted to his home, where he was found dead along with his wife and son. There's been a lot of speculation over that, but what the official police report is that he murdered his wife, strangled his son and then committed suicide following his actions. His sister-in-law recently came out and said years of concussions did not cause the incident - contrary to popular belief - and that Chris had a serious steroid abuse problem, which caused roid-rage that likely lead to the double murder. His death, and the death of Eddie Guerrero, and WWE has now completely banned head shots with weapons. 

***I know Raw and Smackdown. Were there any other WWE brands?*** 

-WWE brought back the ECW brand in 2006 as a weekly TV series, Rob Van Dam, and Tommy Dreamer, ECW quickly became an obvious developmental program, losing the interest of many mainstream wrestling fans. Many consider WW-ECW a failure - both in ratings and content quality - however, notable stars given their first ""big break"" include The Miz, John Morrison

***OH

-TNA Wrestling (http://www.impactwrestling.com/) is a lower end competitor to WWE, but when Hulk Hogan became a partner in the company circa 2010, he did away with the gimmick in favor of a more traditional and polished product. TNA has been criticized for being a haven for ""washed up WWE stars"", as many who hav quit or been released from WWE have landed in the company. This includes such greats as Kurt Angle, the Dudley Boys, Jeff Hardy, Christian, Mick Foley, James Storm, Kazarian and Magnus are among some of the best wrestlers in the world today. In 2013

***So who's a big deal in WWE today?*** 

John Cena(see: above). CM Punk is (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CM_Punk) the current #2 guy in WWE. He was an upper-midcard star, backstage executives like John Laurinaitis, and claimed the company would be better when Vince was dead; although admitted that his ""idiot son-in-law"" wouldn't be much better. That single promo put him on the map, and he defeated John Cena to become WWE Champion (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKD-7LH_PvA), and briefly left the company with the title. He is now a 5-time world champion (6 if you count ECW) and, apart from Cena, is the top player in pro wrestling today. Other top stars include Randy Orton, Alberto del Rio

***So what's going on with the younger guys on the roster?*** 

WWE is in a state of up-and-coming talent right now. It's actually a PERFECT time to get back into wrestling. After years of having a generally stagnant roster, the faction known as THe Shield - Dean Ambrose, Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns - hold the tag team and United States titles. They are all WWE rookies, although two have a lot of experience in the independent circuits. Daniel Bryan is one of the most popular guys in wrestling today, and in my opinion (for what it's worth) he's the best wrestler on the planet. He and Kane were an odd-couple tag team for the past year, but have recently broken up, are on relatively decent terms, Big E Langston, and Antonio Cesaro. 

***I recognize Brock Lesnar. What's he got going on?*** 

Brock Lesnar was a WWE Superstar for a sneeze between 2002 and 2004. He did more in that time than most wrestlers will accomplish in a life time. He defeated guys like The Rock, Big Show and Kurt Angle in quick secession. After making a ton of money in WWE, he left to pursue other interests. After failing to make a splash in the NFL, he took up mixed martial arts, and became a dominant UFC Heavyweight Champion. His UFC run was as short as his WWE run however, after he developed diverticulitis and had to pull out of a few fights. He returned to WWE in 2012 with a new part-time contract forcing him to only wrestle a few dates a year, despite making a ridiculous amount of money. He faced John Cena in a brutal match at Extreme Rules on PPV, facing CM Punk; both men are friends of

Anyway

First up it was Orton vs. Fandango. It was around the time when Orton hit the superplex she admitted wrestling was not as fake as she thought. When Orton then hit the DDT off the ropes she was convinced Fandango had broken his neck... By the RKO she was literally in tears. Like actual tears. I kinda felt bad.

So

After about the fifth time she thought Ziggler had been killed

Before anybody complains about a match being missing or how the older matches don't stack up or whatever: wrestling ratings, and he's never watched enough lucha by his own admission. On top of that we have to take into account that a five-star match in 1988 probably wouldn't be a five-star match today because the sport evolves and changes.

But still: this is a SHIT-TON of awesome wrestling here, including the absolutely insane Los Gringos Locos match from When Worlds Collide in 1994 where the fans were about ready to MURDER Eddie Guerrero if he won the match. Want to see what women's wrestling REALLY is supposed to look like? Those AJPW women's links will school you on why Manami Toyota is basically the best wrestler who has ever lived ever, male or female (I personally recommend the Toyota/Aja Kong match or the final Toyota/Hokuto).

1334265123.0,s6t6s,Ok guys.  Lets seriously talk about the direction of this subreddit.  THIS WILL AFFECT POLICY!,Pudie,367,69,296,"Upvote this to get it the most visibility please.  I get no karma.  

-----

There's been more and more talk recently about how this place is slowly becoming less about discussion and more just a place to karma whore with funny pictures.  

When I started this place I started it for a place for people to *discuss* wrestling with a community they felt a part of.  And I think we've done an amazing job with that.  But slowly it's becoming less about discussion and more just about karma whoring.  I don't want that.  I've said in another thread I don't want to become [/r/gaming](/r/gaming) but I'm fine being /r/movies.  

I know we've always been about ""hey do whatever!"".  But we've also always been about reflecting the wants of the community and more and more are speaking up against the direction we're going.  So here's where you guys come in....

**What should we do going forward?** There's a few options I can think of

* Go self posts only.  This totally takes out karma whoring because self posts dont get any.
* Ban image memes.  Pretty much if it's in [/r/AdviceAnimals](/r/AdviceAnimals) it's not allowed here.  If we go this way should we ban [/r/SquaredCircle](/r/SquaredCircle) created wrestling ones too?
* Ban [Fixed] type posts and other similar ones.  If it should be a reply
* All images must be directly related to wrestling.  For example you can't post a picture of a guy dressed a tree with the title ""LOL Nature Boy"". 
* Ban DAE/this guy type posts.
* Hiding/disabling upvote and downvote arrows

Note: the bullet points above are not changes we're making yet.  Just ideas of changes we can make. 

**PLEASE SPEAK UP! This is going to affect this place moving forward so if you want change you need to say so!!**

His thoughts on John Cena:

""I think there's a streak going involving John Cena that both the WWE Universe and the media have failed to pick up on. The glory days of 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin lasted two, going to every city, main eventing every Pay Per View, the focal point of Monday Night Raw… Steve Austin's peak was two-and-a-half years. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson's peak was along the same lines. John Cena has been the focal point of WWE since 2005. For eight and now going on nine years, John Cena has not only main evented all the Pay Per Views, been the major attraction on Raw. John Cena has gone to every city, main events all the live events, he's done more Make-A-Wish Foundation visits than anybody in history…and he's a tireless workhorse. And he shows up last Monday with his elbow…looking grotesquely…is that a word? His elbow was so messed up and yet he says,False,

All you can ever hope for in a heel valet is that he/she be a good mic worker and get consistent heat. So you can strap a young performer onto them and have them elevated alongside them. Heyman was the best, Bischoff, Sherry ... Vickie is better than all of them, IMHO. She's the best.

No one on the entire roster gets as much consistent heat as she has for the past 10 years. No one.  One screech of ""excuse me"" and the whole building erupts in boos. The Cougar nonsense, other talent have benefited from being paired with her. The pairing with Edge and later Ziggler clearly elevated their status as top-level heels and she's put over AJ before her heel turn. AJ went from a barely used new talent to the leading storylines after that.

True, poor booking all around. And poor skills. Thwagger is worthless on mic, you can't build up a top heel if the crowd is laughing at how silly he sounds during the whole promo.

The fact that she's so hated by the crowd is all the more remarkable considering she's Ed's widow and everyone loved Ed and his family

I'm glad that they hinted at Ryback being paired with her. Reeves is probably the most misused talent in the company right now. Putting some of her heat onto him is desperately needed, let Vickie do all of the talking. He'll be a respectable heel with that formula.

And I genuinely respect the fact that she's hit the gym,False,,t5_2sljg,1373549966.0,,colt,t3_1i25pu

I noticed a picture of Hogan on the wall behind the register. It was surveillance footage of him at the register. I pointed to the picture and asked the man ""Is that Hulk Hogan? What was he doing in this area?"" The man (who was the owner of the place) said ""He bought wine cooler and he is asshole!"" I laughed and said ""I'm a wrestling fan and I hate him for my reasons
I was laughing and asked him to tell me more. He said, brother.' I told him no, I want money!"" He then went on saying that Hogan took the wine coolers and said ""I'll get you back, brother. Don't worry, brother!"" 
I was almost in tears because he was imitating Hogan with his Korean accent. 

**TL/DR**
Hulk Hogan went to a liquor store and tried to buy WINE COOLER but his card was declined. He then tried paying for it via an autograph but the owner declined. Hogan left the store saying ""I'll pay you back

1369250291.0,1eupk6,"""Limited"" Move sets? (PART 1)",weezel365,299,39,116,"On the Road to WrestleMania this year

So starting the Monday night after WrestleMania, rewound, and every single move every performer did in the ring through six weeks of RAW and SmackDown events. This had a few downsides, as it started to numb my enjoyment of some matches as I became more familiar with everyone's moves, but I think it gave me a little more insight into how different wrestlers put matches together in their heads. 

A few notes before we begin. **NO PUNCHES, if a wrestler pulled out a European uppercut or headbutt or a strike specialized to their arsenal, it was added to the list. **LOCK UPS, REVERSALS, AND CHAIN WRESTLING WAS NOT RECORDED**. There is very little chain wrestling in the WWE, but what there is was not recorded. You'd have to hold a submission for more than five seconds to count. **MORE MOVES DOES NOT MEAN MORE DIVERSE**. Some guys had more TV time than others. Some guys had relatively little TV time and used it very well. Some guys had a lot of TV time and looked good... but did the *same old shit*. Others were on TV but didn't have matches. I only wrote down what happened in the ring during a match from *bell to bell* and only *moves that actually connected.* Say, Dolph Ziggler went for a top rope Blockbuster but Del Rio ducks? Wouldn't count. Good? Grood. Great and Good.

Finally, *I don't know the name of every improvised move*. I'm pretty sure I wrote down different names for the same or similar moves under different wrestlers. Sometimes, I wrote down bullshit just to cover my ass at the moment. If I did and you have no idea what I'm talking about? I'm sorry. If need be, I'll try to find a GIF or JPG or YouTube, but I can't promise anything, 'cause seriously... six weeks.

Here's how I propose we go about it. **Starting Friday** we  ......

* Bombard twitter with #ColtAMA

* E-mail  coltwrestling@gmail.com respectfully asking him to do one.

* **[Buy some of his merch](http://www.coltmerch.com) or [download some of his stuff](http://www.digitalcolt.com) and in the instructions field ask for an AMA**

I bolded the last point because I think it would be the most effective.  We get upwards of 10

Since this is starting Friday I say we take the next day or two to iron some things out and maybe make some sort of official letter to email.  But we will make this happen!

I knew it wasn't common knowledge but I didn't think this story was virtually unknown to almost every wrestling fan on the internet today. So I decided to write up this summary to give a new perspective on the sale of WCW.

For those that have watched to lots of shoot interviews both by RF Video/Kayfabe commentaries and the various radio shows/podcasts all over the internet

&gt;WWF's end of fiscal 2001 report (released 7/28) notes that all of the intellectual properties and assets of WCW including the trade name

&gt;This is despite an offer from Bischoff/Fusient Media Group for $48.3 million

&gt;The Fusient offer included a $5 million deposit  - so, Fusient had agreed to take over every contract - relieving AOL-Time Warner of more than $15 million in salary payouts.

&gt;Instead

Brad Siegel, WWF's President and COO from 2000-2001. They both worked together previously at Turner and Stu Snyder is currently the President of Turner Broadcasting Company after returning to the company years after he left the WWF. Both of them were in-charge of negotiating the sale of WCW to the WWF.

Keep in mind, ANY network owned by the company).

The following quotes are from Bob Ryder (Former WCW Employee and current Director Talent Bookings &amp; Travel for TNA Wrestling) via 1wrestletalk.com on July 30th 2001...

&gt;""While Fusient was still at the negotiating table [and negotiating in good faith], but that Snyder turned it down and went to work with the WWF.""

&gt;""When it became obvious that the only way the WWF could get back in the hunt to buy WCW would be if the shows were cancelled...that's exactly what Siegel made sure happened.""

&gt;""Siegel sabotaged his own company by convincing Kellner to cancel the shows. He did that AFTER he made a call to Stu Snyder and found out the only way he could make a deal with the WWF was to cancel the shows."" ""Once the shows were cancelled

&gt;""There were at least four offers from people who were willing to pay much more than the WWF paid..... A group headed by former WCW exec Jay Hassman had tried several times to be included in the bidding

Now while all this is shady

&gt;The nub of Ryder's argument is that whatever Siegel's reasons for getting rid of WCW to WWF - ""Siegel's actions weren't in the best interest of stockhoders...""

&gt;""How stupid do you have to be not to realize that it's a better business decision to take an offer of say $20 million with $5 million paid upfront in cash as opposed to a deal totalling $2.5 million that leaves you liable for $15 million in salary to people who will be sitting home taking paychecks for three years?""

&gt;""The way Brad Siegel handled the company was at best inept leadership. At worst it was criminal.""

Also keep in mind

So when people blame AOL Time Warner's merger for WCW's desmise, thus the push for them to go more family friendly when the WWF was murdering them with mature programming.

Regardless

&gt;WCW gave Jerry Jarrett all the information he needed to make a bid but Jarrett was stonewalled by WCW. Ryder claims it wasn't Bischoff who did the stone walling.

&gt;""Early in the year, several groups started trying to put deals together. ....Jarrett received virtually every important financial document needed to put his deal together, and still has those documents. My conversations with Jarrett were always along the lines of his wanting to make sure the company was bought by someone other than Vince McMahon.He [Jarrett] was stonewalled...but ultimately it was in favor of Vince McMahon, not Eric Bischoff. When Siegel pulled the trigger on the deal, he ended up blowing everyone else out of the water so McMahon was the only one who could buy it. Jarrett was being represented by one of the top investment bankers in the country, and Siegel refused to return his calls. (Bob Ryder Tuesday, July 31

[Source for Bob Ryder quotes](http://www.oocities.org/colosseum/arena/9893/wcw_sale3.htm)

So you may ask; why this isn't mentioned more often? Well it's because statements like this are pretty heavy accusations. Those in-the-know have moved on. Nothing can be done about it now.

How do we know that this true? We don't but Brad Siegel and Stu Snyder were friends and were in-charge of negotiating the deal with both parties. Most of what is said above is fact. The amount WCW was sold for. The amount Fuscient was offering. It didn't make much sense from AOL Time Warner's perspective to begin with if you just go by the facts.

Jake was super-awesome to talk with.  He seemed even more positive that a week ago.  I found out that the videos on DDP's YouTube page are a little bit behind and Scott Hall has been sober for 39 days now

Then, but all of a sudden I get a 'Hey yo' on the line.  Scott Hall is talking to me!  Scott immediately asked where I was from and I told him and shared a memory of when I saw him beat Dean Douglas for the IC title here.  Then he told me a story about how he went to an ECW show as Justin Credible's guest and Shane Douglas and Bam Bam Bigelow kicked him out of the locker room and locked him out of the building.

I'm really rambling here, so stay tuned for that.

If there are any questions I may be able to answer.  Jake told me that he is going to be in my city for an event in the next few months

Peace.",,t5_2sljg,False,,dusty2,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/19gvz4/so_jake_the_snake_roberts_called_me_again_last/

Before I get to the changes that are going to be implemented I first want to make it clear that the intention was to never take the fun and humor out of here.  I love this character of this place and the entire community.  Just like wrestling itself

With that said.....

* No more [FIXED] posts.  If it's should be a reply to an image post it in that thread.  
* All images, post pictures of Ric Flair all you like but images like [this](http://i.imgur.com/jEYj4.png) aren't allowed. 
* DAE or ""This guy/PPV/theme song/etc"" posts will only be allowed as self posts.  If you want to talk about how great someone is then actually talk about it. 

**Edit to expand on ""this guy"" posts meaning.**  We're looking to avoid posts that are links to something that we feel works better as a discussion.  We get that you like Shark Boy.  Tell us why!  Pictures of you and/or your friends meeting wrestlers are ok. 

That's it.  I feel like this is a great balance of everyone's input and will go a long way to stopping this place from becoming a karma whorehouse as it grows.

There's been a bit of concern as of late about the state of our little slice of the internet. The growing concern of the ""rules"" of the subreddit has led to some frustration. While I can certainly understand why people are upset about the changes

I propose that everyone endeavor to participate in a forum-wide discussion of establishing a better sense of structure to our home. This is where we go to discuss wrestling. Here, or high school drama that occasionally happens between mods and the rest of us.

I left the old subreddit to come here because someone messaged me and promised me a place where I would be free from people like JohnnyHyperion. We could relax and not have to worry about moderators making changes and acting swiftly with their power. These new changes,000 subscribers, why are we coming up with rules and day-long guidelines on when and where we share our material? There are subreddits that exist with five to ten times the number of people who don't have ""Fan Fridays"" or ""Meme Wednesdays"". We don't need r/WooWooWoo. It can all exist here. If you don't like the content, don't look at it. If you want to post image macros of Dolph Ziggler, do it. This place can be self governing. This is supposed to be a community where we can post wrestling related things and enjoy a laugh or two. Take away the right of the individual to post anything related to wrestling, and this is no longer an open forum. It's something else.

Please don't take my wreddit away. I'd hate to have to leave another subreddit and show up on someone else's turf

After watching Antonio Cesaro put on a stellar match and hearing possibly the most abysmal commentary I've ever heard, since the finish is scripted in wrestling, Cole's ability to sell the emotion of the match is even more important.  What Cesaro really needed in that match was an angry, frightened Cole dismayed by the Unholy Alliance that is Coulter/Cesaro (in addition to questioning Zeb's motives).  What we got was giggling, sarcastic Cole making a mockery of the situation.

 JR understood what I'm talking about

**The big issue at hand**: they lost a good bit of money from one major revenue streams (cutting down significantly on PPVs and buyrates for the remaining ones didn't increase) and started spending more money on taking the show on the road, overseas markets, TV ratings, etc.) haven't really improved at all.  In fact, in some cases, things have gotten worse (in June, an episode of Impact didn't break the top 100 cable shows for adults 25-54, you can't lose a big source of money

The results of that have been:

- Significant cut backs on flying in wrestlers for tapings.

- Office staff

- Rumors of morale sinking

- Many staff members deals restructured and asked to take paycuts or to work on per-night appearances.

- Senior VP of Programming and Talent Relations Bruce Prichard released after refusing to take a paycut.

- TNA agent D-Lo Brown agrees to per-night deal

- Lindsey Bynum

- Matt Morgan released (reportedly asked for it after seeing the writing on the wall)

- DOC (who was seemingly in the midst of a storyline)

- TNA house show in Missouri is changed because someone dropped the ball and Chris Sabin, Wes Brisco, Gail Kim and Miss Tessmacher were all unable to get licensed to wrestle in the state.

- Dixie Carter gives a speech to the locker room

- TNA releases Jesse Sorenson

- Then #AskDixie happens

- Word comes out that Taz tried to jump ship from TNA but was unable to get WWE to sign him.

- The coup de gras: Dixie Carter releases a long statement online to the fans, when things get so bad that you feel the need to address the rumors publicly, generally things are the total opposite of ""fine.""  The President of the company being forced to address rumors about their stability is not something that makes employees, networks, or investors feel confident.

- TNA recently cancelled 2 live events in the northwest due to low ticket sales

- TNA OnDemand subscribers have started getting emails stating that the video on demand service will no longer be offered as of Friday

Now, normal measures, some of these stories may have other sides to them that we haven't heard, and some of them may be entirely wrong and based on speculation and hearsay.

But one thing is true: TNA is pretty much still at the whim of Panda Energy and Spike TV.  If either of those organizations decided to pull their funding and support today

Furthermore, doesn't help matters.  Once the snowball of low morale and bad publicity begins to roll, it's hard to stop and only gets worse.  Often questionable booking decisions don't help matters.  This has all happened very quickly, which looks even worse.

In the end, but in it's 11+ year history, the writing on the wall for the company has never looked as bad as it does now.

Back in '99 (I think) unmasked Rey Mysterio went on a run when they called him the Giant Killer. He beat Kevin Nash, but you want to believe that Rey stood a chance because of how hard he worked. Classic babyface shit. And I believed he could win.

The same is true for D-Bry. Even though he's an underdog because he's smaller

Cena wins because he's Cena. He's never been portrayed as more skillful. The most flattering thing the announce team can call him is unorthodox. His defining characteristic is resilience. Never give up

We opened our lives and hearts to world to share Mum and the kind of person and inspiration she was as we are so proud of all she had fought and accomplished and if she could inspire just one person it was worth it... the response was simply overwhelming for our family. 

The night before she passed hundreds and thousands of people were thinking and praying for her and that was unbelievable to know that so many people knew Angela Galloway. 

I wish we could thank everyone individually as everyones words have touched us all. From my WWE family

We say goodbye tomorrow and its going to one big celebration with Mums request of no black

She watched and inspired me to live my dream. At Wrestlemania in Atlanta my father Andrew Snr, with my Dad struggling to find words to say being a little bit taken aback, she didn't say anything and just smiled at him as he was allowing me to live my dream) We then travelled over 1000 miles in a seven seater National lampoon style having adventures along the way and at our final stop in New Orleans on the final night we took a horse and carriage around the amazing city. 

Tomorrow befitting of our Queen she takes her final journey in the exact same manner. There will be no moments silence either as we are celebrating a woman who put more energy and achieved more than anyone could in 5 lifetimes

Thank you everyone
The Galloway family.

Angela Anne Galloway

1961-2012

She is the heart of our family

A true testament of the human spirit

An inspiration to everyone she ever came in contact with

She was a wife, a daughter, an aunt and she was our mother

The crowd was full of kids who wanted to see their hometown heroes triumph over the dastardly heels

But there was this group of jackasses in ""hwo"" shirts... Apparently that's [Heel World Order](https://twitter.com/HeelWorldOrder). They spent the whole show trying to get themselves over. Local face comes back after 13 months away, and that they were just way too smart to let anyone get anything over on them. I suppose Heel World Order is a good name, though, because I spent the whole show wishing someone would punch them in their fucking faces, which is the same response I had to several of the heels on the card.

I get it. The faces in WWE are almost always boring. It's annoying when we get the John Cena show for years on end. But fucking hell, fucking do it! Doing otherwise means you're not only missing out on part of the experience the wrestlers are trying to give you, you're also just being a jackass. A jackass who apparently feels that 200 people really need to know that you think you're smarter than a 12 year old.

Since I already live in Atlanta


This last weekend was the real deal though, and the snake himself.


I arrived at the house around 7:30 and learned another $1k donater named Jason would be staying the weekend too.  He was a really cool dude


Scott was still in a lot of pain from his surgery


Jake is doing phenomenal and looks great.  Dude was incredibly funny all weekend


In the morning we did DDP Yoga with DDP himself


In the evening we got a big surprise in that DDP was taking us all to the Fox theater to see Mike Tyson's one man show!  And we got [BACKSTAGE PASSES!](http://i.imgur.com/Px9ed88.jpgg).  Also here's a [picture of us before the show](http://i.imgur.com/TLpT9fZ.jpg).

I didn't know what to expect from a one man Mike Tyson show, in our very row, Evander Holyfield and his entourage sit down.


The show continues and Tyson eventually talks about his match with Evander and pauses, and Evander stands up and the whole crowd goes wild cheering.


After the show we all went back stage which was a treat in and of itself.  I've grown up in Atlanta


Unfortunately we didn't get to meet Tyson as he was mostly talking to Evander as one would expect and it was getting late so we headed back to DDP's house.


Sunday we did yoga again with DDP


Sunday was also the day I took the bulk of my pictures with everyone.  Here's a few of my favorites:

* [Stay classy Jake](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Z_TEuq6wejw/UXQkXYd7S6I/AAAAAAAADVA/mMMgXwT4gEg/s528/IMAG0145.jpg)

* [Heavyweight Champ of the World!](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ldRLri_Q8yI/UXQ3jSitb0I/AAAAAAAADVw/3PBg4wiU3fc/s885/IMAG0147.jpg)

**Note** everyone looks odd in this picture because they were all trying to look taller than one another standing on their toes and generally goofing around.


And my favorite:


* [The Bad Guy](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Hs0YdxQwsSo/UXP9Dfu6vNI/AAAAAAAADUU/JBkJMzb2Rig/s528/IMAG0143.jpg)

He's looking so much better.  

* [Here's the picture I took with him last month for reference.](http://i.imgur.com/GXnTYyM.jpg)


Over all it was an amazing experience totally worth every penny.  I got to spend the weekend with my childhood heroes and see how far both Jake and Scott have come in a very short amount of time

Mick Foley wanted to challenge CM Punk to a survivor series match. The Higher ups said this was stupid and it's now Zigglers time to shine. Can he lead his team to Victory? 

After Big Shows domination over Sheamus at Hell in a Cell can the Great White muster up his fortitude and topple the giant? 

With 2 months of backstage assaults and evasion

John Cena. CM Punk. The Ryback. These three men will face each other tonight in a match to find out who is hungriest. The Ryback has a vendetta and an appetite for destruction. Can CM Punk hold on to his championship or will the odds be against him?

The apology:
&gt;Wrestling has always had good guys and bad guys (heels)
&gt;
&gt;I remember being in Austin, again a lifelong diehard Cowboy fan) being there and cutting a promo on the Cowboys about why they were losers. Both of those just killed me, but it’s a work-it’s what I do.
&gt;
&gt;This past week I did 5 hours of TV for WWE
&gt;
&gt;This past week I said many ‘heel’ things not intended to offend but rather to entertain.
&gt;
&gt;I had said (working with two of best announcers in WWE history) that I was a ‘dollar working with two dimes’ (referring to JR and Cole).
&gt;
&gt;I had said Brodus Clay was a cross between LaToya Jackson and Free Willy or a ‘Justin Timberlake trained sea monster’.
&gt;
&gt;I said Mil Mascaras had a huge ego and glad his nephew ADR did not (when in reality ADR has a huge ego filled character on TV)
&gt;
&gt;I went to Primo and Epico and made sure I had their title history as well as their father Carlo Colon’s
&gt;
&gt;I quoted their history
&gt;
&gt;However
&gt;
&gt;So my apologies to Mr Colon

* Paul Heyman is doing some of the realest in-ring work from a manager/non-wrestler we've seen in years. Not only is it believable

* Bo Dallas is getting a legitimate title feud within minutes of being in the WWE, the Shield have one match and yet they're one of the best heel stables we've seen in a while.

* Dolph is one of the best wrestlers on the rosters

* Khali/Hornswoggle shit is getting less and less playtime.

* CM Punk has a legitimate claim in his storyline. He wasn't in the video

* Del Rio's face turn already has more memorable moments than his heel career.

* They're dropping the whole Tensai being this pissed off monster or whatever he was supposed to be for a more comedy side which he seems to be better suited for. He'll never have a major title in WWE

* The Hall of Pain is back

* Lesnar is being booked perfectly. An animal who not even Paulie can contain.

* Cena is nowhere near the title scene at this point. Although he has the title match at WM they're keeping him to a minimum

**QUICK PLUGS**

Just quickly, we help run a show in honor of Stinky the Homeless Guy/Phrank Morin who was taken from us in 2011 by Cancer. In the past 2 years, we've raised 24 000$ for the Canadian Cancer Society in his honor and we hope to add more to that this year. EVERY SINGLE PENNY earned from this event goes to the Canadian Cancer Society in Phrank's name.
