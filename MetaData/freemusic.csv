The Horizon of a Dream and themes present on this album were inspired by the nature sequences found in the film ""Avatar."" Beyond this, love, and death in general.

My personally recommended tracks are ""To Dream of You Awake (While I Watch You Sleep)""

If you enjoy my music feel free to download and comment.
