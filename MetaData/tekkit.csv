",12,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/tekkit/comments/zyhir/solar_panel_factory_how_to_create_a_factory_for/,"**Edit: If you don't care about learning how to do this, [here's a picture](http://i.imgur.com/XRC19.jpg) and maybe read the first two paragraphs if you want.**

**Edit 2: [World download. Technic 7.2.6](http://www.mediafire.com/file/1c9pf6vrsjez9e4/solar_panel_factory_fixed.zip)**

**Edit 3: The original world download was bad. I had ""copper"" instead of ""copper ingot"" and it was broken. The link has been updated to fix this.**

I wanted to build a solar panel factory but couldn't find a whole lot of info on how to do so. There are some examples out there but no tutorials

So here's what I've come up with. [To start, rubber, copper, tin, redstone, cobblestone, and iron) that automatically feeds to the appropriate module. I use retrievers and retrievulators (not that complex once you understand them) for that. This fits in a 11x15 area and is only 6 blocks high + some wiring underground. I do not guarantee that items will not be created in surplus (if coal is being macerated too quickly

--------------------------------------------------

Tutorial time:

[Take another look at the first picture. I added some numbers to it.](http://i.imgur.com/p6hMZ.jpg) See how there are really only two distinct things going on?

1. These towers are building things using an automated crafting table (in this example, furnaces, iron furnaces, circuits, generators, and solar panels)
2. These sections are using IC machines to create things (in this example, and coal dust)

The reason they look different is because automated crafting tables output from the top and input from anywhere else. IC machines output from any side and input from the top.

Ok

- Retriever. Put things in here that you need for the recipe. Retrievers will request items from the nearest inventory that has it. Make sure you set the retriever to ANY ITEM mode by clicking the little icon on the bottom left of the 3x3 grid. It's complicated to explain
- Retrievulator. There's almost no documentation on this, but basically, if you have two sections of your factory that use the same item, one of them will never get that item unless you make use of a retrievulator. Also, when you place the retrievulator, make sure you are placing by clicking on the bottom of the crafting table (hold shift) or it will be backwards and won't work.
- Crafting table MKII. Build your recipe in the grid...easy enough.
- Filter. There's no configuration for this item. When it gets a redstone pulse it will suck up to a stack of items out of the crafting table.

Some other things to note:

- The mysterious redstone wire on the side: I don't use any timers in my design. The retrievulator constantly (should never stop) sends out a redstone pulse on its own that triggers the retriever. It pulses once per second. I use that pulse to trigger the filter at the top of the stack so I'm always pulling the item out of the crafting table and into the chest.
- The covers on the back of the tower: These are here to make sure the tube doesn't connect from the output chest at the top to any of the machines. I like to use glass panels but I went with white here because they are easier to see.
- The single restriction tube on the output chest: This is a little more complex. I'll explain that later with another diagram.

[Ok

- The retriever/retrievaluator setup is the same. This is a bit simpler since I'm only sending coal to this. My image shows one coal, too. When you place the retrievaluator, jump and place it under your feet, then place the retriever on top or it will be backwards and won't work.
- The redstone wire: Same purpose.
- The output pipe from the filter: This looks a little wonky
- There is also a restriction tube on the output chest (hard to see) which I'll explain further on.

[Ok

Now that you understand the peices

The input chest gets all the raw materials. You can see how the pipe goes from the input to every single module. That way they have access to raw materials if they need them. For that matter, the solar panel can get generators, circuits, glass, and coal dust from those areas, etc...

The best part is that the whole thing is modular. It would be trivial for me to add the ability for this factory to create solar array's simply by putting the necessary modules on the end and connecting them. Let's say you wanted a Lapotron Crystal factory...you need circuits, but here's the design.](http://i.imgur.com/iwdZf.png) You need 4 crafting module and one machine module. Just make sure you have the input chest connected as shown and there you go! You could even alter the input to be done with EE + collectors if that's what you like. Then you can just turn the thing on, leave it, and come back to tons of whatever you want.

A couple more things:

- Restriction tubes. Put one of these on the output of each chest. Red power tubes work by having items go to the closest inventory that will accept it. That means ANY open chest or a retriever that has that specific item on the list. I think retrievers will get some level of preference over chests if they request an item (maybe), so the chests appear really far away to the items and they only go there as a last resort.
- Regarding the previous note, because next time iron is requested it will come out of the battery chest until that gets used up. You might get 3 or 4 slots of random items in each of those chests, but they won't ever get more than a few per slot so the chest won't get full of crap.
- [Here's a quick screenshot of the power.](http://i.imgur.com/HMpG8.jpg) It's thrown together under everything and is routed up. IC machines get their power

I created an Age for the kids. Full brightness and always day (So they won't whine about going to bed. It gets annoying when they yell BBBEEEEDDDD

So lets give some names for my friends so you know who is doing what.

* Me: Me
* Admin: The admin
* Russ: Friend
* Spy: Friend of mine who befriended the kids
* Kid A: A kid
* Kids B: A group of 3 kids

Lets start off with the Spy. He is a friend of mine who doesn't go on too often, now I have a link to what they are doing. I told him to take screenshots of any misbehaving and Ill post a few.

Kid A: Did a bit of griefing in peoples homes. [This is the admins home](http://imgur.com/a/SPlfq#0) Spy sent me these and I told the admin about it.

Kids B were the first to get trapped in an age. I told my spy to follow them around and see where they go. They went into our area and checked out our homes and snooped around. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/IGxprbt.jpg) and [Here](http://i.imgur.com/eloHxVJ.jpg).
A portal had been set up in a small room where I normally write ages and I told him to get them into the room and into the portal. They were snooping around anyway, but good on him. These three are trapped now :D

Now, I am on when he gets on, as well as the 3 kids already stuck there. Kids B want to make a nether portal and excape that way (You can't make a nether portal in an age, but they don't know that). They ask Kid A to get some obsidian and this is where I am lucky to be around (My spy wasn't online right now). He goes into our area and breaks into my [buddy Russ's place](http://i.imgur.com/LL4C0QS.png) and [fills a stone wall with cobble](http://i.imgur.com/v7GYcrS.png). I go invis and place the portal right outside the door to the kids world while Kid A checks inside my buddies house. As Kid A comes out, he notices the portal and is hesitant to go through. Everything gets tense and finally, he goes through. YEAH! All of them stuck.

They don't know that they are trapped within the world and they are not getting out. I told them that there was a portal

Here is the quest story (I feel like a DM)

*You awake on the ground in a mysterious place. The sun looms overhead in an eerie blue sky. You look for some shade, you set up camp as you don't know how long it will be. As you construct your house, you find a small piece of paper under a rock. It is scratched up, but it reads ""An old man may help you escape. He lives in a small cave in a desert"". The back of the paper has a crude map, showing a desert to the north. You gather your supplies and head off in search of the old man. The desert is burning under the sun as you look for the old mans home. You come up to a large cliff and look over, scanning the area. You see something in the distance and run to it. A Ha! You have found the old mans shack. You knock on the door gently. No response. You take a peak in and see that no one is home. All you see is a torch over a desk. A note lays there. ""Hidden treasures and secrets in an abandoned mine. An Oil well in a grassy area flows into the mine."" More searching. Great. (Ill cut to the chase now, and this is also where the kids are in the story. They have been searching an oil well in a desert, with a note that says ""There are a ton of diamonds in the ground around here"" (There isn't really any note that leads them on the next

Once they move farther in the quest

It is nice that they aren't building in the over world though. [Here is something they built](http://i.imgur.com/N4LRvLo.png). I think it is a diving board or what ever. Just glad it isn't in the main world!

Anyway

The goal of the game is to blow up the other player's nuclear reactor with a nuke

1. Build a ceremonial wall to separate your respective areas. They should be pretty near each other though. Near enough so that you can see each other

2. The race is on! Now the players/teams have to build a working nuclear reactor as fast as possible. I'm thinking there should be something that should be produced with the energy from the reactor, is how I assumed it worked before I looked at the wiki).

3. The first one to build a nuclear reactor then can build a nuke as quick as possible. Only one nuke at a time though

4. Then the goal is, plant the nuke, and destroy their nuclear reactor, or whatever they've got at that stage.

Not sure how its all going to work

As for the others, have annoying mannerisms, admit they don't know how to build what is the subject of the video,  screw up and retry several times, have bad sound, etc.  I bail out of most of them.  Usually while screaming.


If you're gonna post a youtube video:

    Get to the friggin point.  
    Practice first.  
    Know what you are doing and why you are doing it.
    Don't even bother if you have a cold.
    Turn off key clicks.
    Don't waste our time with small talk.
    Don't try to be funny.  You aren't.
    If you screw up edit it out or do it over.
    Keep it short.  Under 10 minutes.
    Keep it to one topic.

ok.  Youtube rant over.

I don't need a video.  I don't want to sit through a long explanation. What I'd love to see are diagrams of how to setup machines.  For instance, why it's there, why it's hooked up how it is and any other notes. Clearly visible items free of texture packs.  Just BAM you see the diagram you know what to do.  Questions? Refer to the annotations.  The wiki has some pictures but all of them that I found were thumbnails.

However

In summary:

-high energy output

-little ongoing cost (i.e. no single use coolants)

-no babysitting - I don't mind if components have to be shuffled around / reactor paused to cool for a bit and whatnot as long as the process can be successfully and reliably automated with pipes/computers/whatever

-I'm hoping to get energy outputs in the 1024 range or better for less than the cost of a couple hv solar arrays

When I complained on the forum about the low utilization and fingered EE as a likely culprit

Am I right to blame EE? Has this been the experience of other server ops? Could it just be school starting up (many of our players are high school or college aged, ironically).

How is this handled on other servers? Limiting the rate of condensers seems promising at first but only delays the inevitable. End game in a week instead of 2 days. FFS

I really feel as though a server economy is what keeps a community interested and engaged and building. If you have to work for stuff and share resources and labor

For people who want a hybrid Creative/Survival mode, everybody just flies. Etc.

What I'd like to do is set up a ""hardcore"" world in Multiverse where EE isn't allowed, we've found.  Does anybody know of a fix/patch for this? I imagine it can't be THAT complex. Alchemy bags work. Surely it's just a change to how EE manages its data files for tablets? I've shied away from decompiling EE to patch it because I'm not THAT well versed in setting up a proper Java dev environment such that I'd be able to re-compile the thing successfully, and I just don't want to invest days and days in a fruitless pursuit...

1355888374.0,1538pb,Tekkit: Hard Core... plus something more?,Romanulus,21,3,11,"Hi everyone

/ramble mode

I've played a whole lot of Minecraft vanilla

Recently, thus things like farming is very difficult as liquids don't have 'source blocks' (which is awesome in my opinion). Things such as windmills can be constructed to power machinery, like a mill (for flour to bake bread), or powered screws to pump water to a higher level (for aqueducts), traps could also be made and set (even trip lasers).

Unfortunately
 
**But we want more
  

Maybe there are some Tekkit mods out there (new or one's we haven't seen) that can do **some of the things we're hoping for**:

* No moving of source blocks allowed (fixing buckets... yes
* Harder to self-sustain (this will come somewhat naturally from not moving water sources)... food nourishes less
* No overpowered items (this can already be edited/modded out): Nano armour, etc.
* Remove all matter-creation abilities (scrap/UU matter)
* Much harder mobs: Stronger mobs, but I can dream) Tougher mobs will force players to band together.
* Torches that fizzle out after a while or get rained on (this will make the starting a lot harder

I would love to hear your input or if you know of mods that would get these jobs finished... otherwise
Many thanks in advance!

I was wondering if anybody has played around with using Tekkit with the [Invasion mod.](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/780480-132-invasion-mod-v0110-so-you-think-your-base-is-tough-do-you/)



So has anybody setup a world for this before?

Have any of you played with the Invasion mod before?

I'm wondering if anybody has ideas for making the scenario more challenging?





I am going to be setting up a server for a Lan party at the end of the week using the Invasion mod added to Tekkit. I have designed a Scenario that I am currently setting up for the player to work from. 



Here is the Basic Idea:

EE2 will be completely disabled

There is a chunk of land approximately 300x300 Blocks floating in the void

There is a crashed Space ship full of raw materials (ores, etc)

There is a Nexus block setup near the crash. (this calls in the monsters once activated)

The players are not allowed to break

The players can salvage anything they want to from the ship (including the ship itself)

24.188.60.132:250 : I got gem armor, then it got reset.  Now computercraft, nether ores, DC, dm armor, some dm tools, and auto crafting tables are disabled/not working properly.  This removes the entire point of my tekkit experience.  I have no strategy for progression, so this is a serious deal breaker.  Additionally as of five minutes ago it was BLASTED with spam about how someone is gay.

69.162.119.202:25565 ok, CC works... fine... but there's at most 4 people on at once.  the server has like 22 slots!  4 people is not active enough for my tastes.

74.63.237.163:25 Ok, there was a conversation they had about this) who can mute and tp.  Not a big deal.  I still got my stuff together.  Griefing and going around faction protection was not allowed.  I had a giant emc flower built and started working on programming turtles to build them as well, so I could procedurally create a massive base.  Everything was going great until today, when I guess the admins decided they wanted to not do tekkit.  ""Someone"" showed up with /vanish, /tp permissions and DC'ed EVERYTHING.  

a couple days ago, kicking everyone from server because ""xxx likes ballsocks"".  This is the owner too.

**What I'm asking is this: ""Is there a way to find a mature, nether ores, most of ee (with few things disabled...just enough to prevent griefing) where I can play with a decently active community?(&gt;10 on per average).""**

I want to play this mod.  I want to build awesome things.  I have plans and ideas that I keep getting started on that are just wasting away.

Help?  Suggest/invite to a server? IGN is pwillxorz.  I don't greif, live on my own and am a grad student, so there's some hint at my age. I enjoy music and music technology and can program pretty well.

I think that's everyone that I saw! I'm sorry.
I judged off upvote's solely on this one. Although I will put on my own opinion at the end.


NickdFord has ***11*** upvotes.


Killerpet has ***7*** upvotes. (I honestly think he should have one


Bboymasterz has ***17*** upvotes.


Zarknord has ***19*** upvotes.


Friend_A has ***49*** upvotes!

Shizlanski has ***3*** upvotes.

In my personal opinion Killerpet should have won


I was expecting just people with an elaborate scrap system and a ton of uu matter making diamonds.


What I saw was this, this weeks challenge is another factory.  I promise the week after will be extremely large, I might even extend it to two weeks.

This one you can or cannot use EE

Finally, on how quickly it makes solar arrays.

I'll walk you through it with these pictures. On the left are three tiers of Combustion Engines, moving power into the same conduits. Both sets meet in the middle at a set of two redstone storage cubes, which function as capacitors for low power time or during refueling or modifications. On top of them of course is a chunk loader from ChickenChunks.

In the second picture you can see a better view of the combustion engines. They are recieving water and fuel from a series of liquiducts. The ducts pass above and below the engines so that they are getting fuel on one side and water on the other. TE's liquiducts make this WAY easier than waterproof pipes, but this way there is room for expansion. The rednet cables on the back supply the needed keep-on signal to them and to the liquiducts piping the fuel from the tanks you can see. All of that is controlled from the CC computer (right now with just lua commands, I'll write something eventually) The fuel is being provided by the refinery at the other end of the room. I'll get to that in a sec.

Pic 3 shows the magmatic engines. They are more compact

On the right in pic 4 is yet another Liquid Tesseract (seeing a pattern yet?) which is output for an oil pump. The benefit of this system is that when the oil is gone, with the refiners directly under the cursor. the redwire is there to make the output pipes on both the tanks and the refinery go, and is always on.

Pic6 is just a back view of the output fuel tanks, viewable in both pics 5 and 6, between the redstone energy cells and the refinery. There is a side wire which continues to the refinery of course providing it power.

All in all this took me maybe an hour and a half to set up, x 15) All it requires is for you to do a bit of running around a desert to find an oil geyser, and then some building up of resources.

In total you will need for this setup: 6 Liquid Tesseracts, 15 combustion and magmatic engines, though you can scale this obviously, 1-2 energy cells, a chunk loader, 40-50 tanks (all the towers you see are 10 tall), maybe 30 energy conduits, maybe 30 rednet wires, and a refinery. The combustion engines alone are running a small ME network, harvester/fertilizer

So, and a deployer!) it's actually pretty fun.

I love all of the minefactory machines to death, just load the planter with seeds and moonwalk away.

Speaking of which, and a small ME network to get a lot of resources in compactly. While we explore, the turtles will execute a program to create a glass dome and we can start getting settled.

I'm really enjoying the new Tekkit

Now water, is beyond me.

Lava, slowly at first, just like the water, they just appeared in thin air out of nowhere. It started slowly at first, a source block here and there, then it all of a suddenly just started happening everywhere. Soon we had a entire forest on fire with over 5 source lava blocks, then our house caught fire with 5 or 6 source blocks, just everywhere.

I looked up a pretty cool setup, I'm thinking about [this](http://www.talonfiremage.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/reactorplanner.html?hixpoav1gus2pka5wenp1fd64ae0w9z4j951fe2okuc5izfnk). Do I need these extra precautions, or is it okay with water and one layer of glass, just to hold the water in?",,self,,

1349993516.0,11c07s,Tekkit Survival Project - Volunteer Testers Requested!,Waarlod,16,5,72,"Hello fellow Tekkit'rs(?)! 

Me and my friends have been hard at work configuring our 24 slot Tekkit server for a unique style of Tekkit play. Our focus is to utilize Tekkit for the advanced functionality it brings to the game while still forcing players to interact on some level and removing zero-cost resource generation from the game. We have created scarcity in valuable Tekkit resource which will in turn force players to conduct trade as well and venture outside of their ""bubble"" to progress further.

Our server will have constant administration as well as plenty of plugins that will ensure that play on our server is fair and that trade

Our goal is to create a living

Items that we feel remove the ""adventure"" from the game have been removed and in the future we plan to implement challenges which would allow people to acquire items generated from removed item (such as Dark Matter or Red Matter). Challenges would include pay (in game currency) to play portals for dungeon challenges or unique quests. However

We also plan on including ""kits"" for new players free of charge (wooden equipment

Player owned municipalities would be allowed so that you can sell consumable goods like EU matter or raw power. Prebuild municipalities would also be available in game for purchase (in game currency).

PvP is lawless. There are no rules. Houses can be player protected for griefing. However

Chat is not global and spawning is random. You must adventure to find people (or just circumvent the game.. but hey... we cannot control that!).

Mineral consumption is monitored and enforced. Logic is in place to evaluate average mineral yield per player and deviations from the standards are analyzed. To much deviation will result in inability to mine further. Repetitive offence will result in a ban. This mechanic will need to be tweaked as sometimes you just get on a hot streak... but it's a necessary evil to prevent xraying. 

**Important Server Notes**

* Equivalent Exchange Energy Condensers
* Mining Lasers and Nukes have been disabled.
* Block breakers CANNOT break cobblestone.
* Nukes have been disabled.
* Creepers WILL still do player damage but will not destroy buildings/terrain.
* You cannot use explosives ABOVE surface level (~63) on the map.

**What do we need from you?**

We are hard at work doing the acceptance testing of all of our systems and are looking for 10 players to come onto our server and give it a whirl. In addition
If you are interested please reply in this post or PM me!


Apologize for spelling... threw this together pretty quickly!

Thanks

Waarlod

EDIT: We are just wrapping up the level design. We will test the plugins next week and possibly go live the following Friday

EDIT2: We are out of griefer spots. You are welcome to apply as a player. Players who grief while signed up as a player will be banned. We have agreements with our griefers in place that they will stop a certain grief if caught and all actions of theirs will be excused. My hope is that griefing will be discovered quickly and addressed so when we go live in a few weeks we just banhammer anyone who finds a new exploit.",self,t5_2tokf,1351028677.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/tekkit/comments/11c07s/tekkit_survival_project_volunteer_testers/

Think of it as building sandcastles at the beach. Some are content building a simple shape with towers then sitting back and admiring it. Others build huge, but they're building.

My problem is with the people that think the game is about the accumulation of sand. They make a gigantic bedrock-to-sky cube sheathed in DM blocks and vajazzle their name on the side in diamond blocks. Inside they have cobble generators and ee-flowers large enough to lag the whole server. They tromp over the work of others and offer more sand as compensation for the destruction of sandcastles that took hours of effort.

It would be cool to have less resources in the ground (since civilization had already mined most of them) so you are forced to explore ruins of factorys

You get the choice of either scavenging what you can to be used at your own base or to repair the systems you find to their former glory with guess work which could result in a secret stash of goodies being revealed or it sets off a devious trap the former occupants rigged up.

For example you find a mfsu and a teliporter in an experimental power station setup. You could just take them if you have a wrench on hand or repair the power station to fill the mfsu. Then you use the teliporter which transports you into an underground reinforced stone bunker with some sweet loot. Or it takes you to a tesla coil room with say a 1 minute countdown readout and a computer asking for a password that you may have seen somewhere before to escape.

* **Compact is good.** The less space you waste the more efficient it tends to run and you have space for other things
* **Power loops are something to avoid.** Instead of short-circuiting like real circuits IRL
* **Use volatile sources of energy at your own risk.** When you power your facilities with energy from Nuclear Reactors or Combustion Engines, they have no way of exploding in your face.
* **Don't overdo it with World Anchors.** They're a big source of lag
* **Know the limits of your machinery!** Don't power a electric furnace that can only handle 32EU/t with 128EU/t! Wires have limits to how much they can handle, and vice versa; you may drain too much power than you make, in which case nothing will work.
* **Plan ahead.** Try not to start a project to make something (For example
* **Get more out of your mining trips.** If you use an enderpouch and have a enderchest at home, too. When you macerate these ores, you can get twice as much as normal mining.

EE=Equivalence Exchange

DM=Dark Matter

**Intro**


Im sort of new to this tekkit reddit


Personally i love EE, Alch chests, flying rings etc) however i also notice how overpowered EE is, especially in multiplayer with servers constantly up.


So


**-**For starters I see 2 major issues with the mod in general (not specific items). 


**1.** The relative ease of upgrading tiers of items

**2.**The imbalance caused when other mods are used in conjunction with it (IC
These 2 issues along with the nature of multiplayer servers are the biggest issues.



**My Solutions:**

**1.** Increase the cost of upgrading tiers of machines and materials. For starters, and an EMC change to go along would help the speed that people make it to MK3 collector arrays with infinite resources. Firstly a change to DM and RM blocks, they should be the same recipe as diamond and gold blocks, 9 RM or 9 DM for a block, only common sense. Along with this change, the recipe for Dm should be changed, instead of Diamond block+8 Aetenalis, 3 Diamond block + 6 Aetenalis. This change should also be for Red matter, yet MK2 and Mk3  dont. This should once again be changed so instead of just RM or DM


**2.**A big issue of EE within tekkit is the fact that as apposed to having it by itself it can be used in conjunction with the other tekkit mods, as these let u basically double materials for cheap. It allows you early on to increase you EMC output by a very large amount, and similarly macerators and similar machines allow certain materials be created from materials of lesser EMC value. The most obvious one of these is the Blaze powder EMC generator, which can have the output of a MK3 collector array, for a fraction of the EMC cost. The second issue with this is the addition of materials not already in the game, namely nikolite, tungsten , meaning they are predominantly used for EMC. My solution to this

**Lvl1**=40% loss of emc

**Lvl2**=20% loss of emc

**Lvl3**=0% loss of emc


Following in the trend of collectors these should require DM/RM to upgrade. This should force people to make a choice, or at a higher tier of alchemy.
