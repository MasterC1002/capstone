""This is not my nation any more. This is not my America!"" they say.
Don't laugh- they're probably right.
Because if you believe that America in the 21st century should function under the same assumptions and with the same values as America in the 18th century- then no
If you believe that ""Freedom of religion"" means that you have the right to make decisions about health care, evolution and education for people who do not share your religion- you're in the wrong place.

If you believe that black people vote for a black man only because of race but white people never vote for a white guy because of his race... if you believe that a 90 year old veteran who has been voting for 50 years should be denied a ballot because he no longer has a driver's license... then it's not your America any more.
If you believe that bullying and abuse is ok as long as you do it for Jesus, this is not your America.
If you think you have the right to say who other people can love

And if you believe that it's not possible for your candidate to lose an election unless the ""urban"" people cheated...by voting... that an acceptable way to win is to try to stop as many people as possible from voting

It's not a country where you can just 'opt out' when things don't go your way
It's not a nation where we think it's ok for poor people to die from treatable diseases because millionaire CEO's don't want to cut into their profits. 
And thankfully

You folks are the same people who yell ""America- love it or leave it"" at us every time we try to fix what's broken around here. now, but you are certainly free to go. Of course you don't get to take your state with you- sorry, but that 'Constitution' thing you're always going on about says the states stay together. And you don't get the flag you're always waving; that belongs to America. But you can leave, if that's really what you want. 

The border is that-a-way.

It seems to me, who is often promoted as the pro-life party, should be relabeled the **pro-rape party**. After all, no one has justified the actions of rapists more than these men. Based on the following political views, I am sure the Republicans have the rapist vote secured.

----

**In regards to an event in one of her novels where a woman is seemingly raped by someone whom the author refers to as the 'ideal man':**  
*If it was rape
—Ayn Rand

----

**While making an analogy about bad weather and rape:**  
*If it's inevitable
—Clayton Williams

----

*... the right approach is to accept this horribly created — in the sense of rape — but nevertheless a gift in a very broken way
—Rick Santorum

----

*I would hope that when a woman goes into a physician, was this pregnancy caused by normal relations in a marriage, or was it truly caused by rape.*  
—Chuck Winder

----

*... in a real messy divorce [rape is used] as a tool and a legal weapon to beat up on the husband.*  
—Todd Akin (1991) [[source](http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/08/todd-akin-legitimate-rape.php)]

*If it’s a legitimate rape
—Todd Akin

----

*... that sexual predator could pick that girl up off the playground at a middle school and haul her across the state line and force her to get an abortion to eradicate the evidence of his crime and bring her back and drop her off at the swingset and that’s not against the law in the United States of America.*  
—Steve King

**In regards to No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act which would deny aid for abortion in cases of statutory rape:**  
*Well I just haven’t heard of [a pregnant
—Steve King

----

**When asked how he would explain to a pregnant rape victim why they should be denied the right to abortion:**  
*I lived something similar to that with my own family. She chose life, I didn’t have to ... she chose the way I thought. No don’t get me wrong, it wasn’t rape.*  
—Tom Smith

**When asked to clarify what experience was similar to rape:**  
*... having a baby out of wedlock.* [[source](http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2012/08/27/tom_smith_republican_candidate_makes_rape_gaffe.html)]

----

*If you do [have premarital sex], ‘Oh, yeah, I was part of the program.’ All that she has to say or the parents have to say is it was rape because she’s underage. Remember, Roger, if you go down that road, some girls
—Roger Rivard

----
*Life is that gift from God that I think even if life begins in that horrible situation of rape
—Richard Mourdock

----

**While defending the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act:**  
*There's rape and then there's forcible rape.*  
—Paul Ryan

**When asked about his stance on abortion in the case of rape:**  
*... the method of conception (rape) doesn't change the definition of life.*  
—Paul Ryan

----

**When asked about Mitt Romney's stance on abortion:**  
*I have been chomping at the bit for you to ask this question... I can't wait to get to it. Let me just tell ya... Mitt Romney has always been personally pro-life .... I know from stories from the folks who were under his jurisdiction [as the Mormon stake president in Belmont, for abortions — under his presiding authority. I know that for a fact .... I want to be very clear — he never in his whole life changed his personal policy which was absolute opposition to abortion on religious grounds .... He is more pro-life than any other man I know .... He's never struggled in his heart about the absolute offensiveness and opposition to abortion. Never has. Never will. He's a friend of the pro-life cause and he will be as President [of the United States].*  
—Greg Peterson, GOP activist and fundraiser, and **[SERIAL RAPIST](http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/55136572-78/peterson-cabin-woman-jolley.html.csp)** [[source](http://www.ldsliberty.org/liberty-loving-mormons-for-romney/)]

1340892577.0,vqoi4,Supreme Court UPHOLDS the individual mandate as a tax in the Affordable Care Act,MSkog,64,6,3,"Per SCOTUSBlog. Opinion by Roberts. [HERE IS THE OPINION](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf)

Ginsburg writes separately for the liberal wing of the Court. Kennedy dissents. 

Updates coming as I can get them out. 

Decision is ""very complicated."" 

Plain English

&gt;The Affordable Care Act, five Justices agreed that the penalty that someone must pay if he refuses to buy insurance is a kind of tax that Congress can impose using its taxing power. That is all that matters. Because the mandate survives, the Court did not need to decide what other parts of the statute were constitutional, except for a provision that required states to comply with new eligibility requirements for Medicaid or risk losing their funding. On that question, the Court held that the provision is constitutional as long as states would only lose new funds if they didn't comply with the new requirements, rather than all of their funding.

More plain English: 

&gt;Essentially, ""the mandate can be regarded as establishing a condition -- not owning health insurance -- that triggers a tax -- the required payment to IRS."" Actually, this was the Administration's second backup argument: first argument was Commerce Clause, second was Necessary and Proper Clause, and third was as a tax. The third argument won.

The first paragraph from the SCOTUSblog write-up about it (which is still a work in progress; it was copied to the liveblog): 

&gt;Salvaging the idea that Congress did have the power to try to expand health care to virtually all Americans, the Court did not sustain it as a command for Americans to buy insurance, but as a tax if they don’t. That is the way Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr., was willing to vote for it, and his view prevailed. The other Justices split 4-4, with four wanting to uphold it as a mandate

**Roberts joins the liberal wing of the Court in UPHOLDING the mandate as constitutional.** 

&gt;For readers of the opinion

Medicaid provision is limited but not invalidated. 

&gt;***the entire ACA is upheld

According to SCOTUSBlog

&gt;***The money quote from the section on the mandate: Our precedent demonstrates that Congress had the power to impose the exaction in Section 5000A under the taxing power

` `

&gt;The court reinforces that individuals can simply pay the tax and not comply with the mandate.

On Medicaid: 

&gt;On the Medicaid issue

Also on Medicaid: 

&gt;The key comment on salvaging the Medicaid expansion is this (from Roberts): ""Nothing in our opinion precludes Congress from offering funds under the ACA to expand the availability of health care

On severability: 

&gt;The Court does not reach severability issues

**BIG DEAL: COMMERCE CLAUSE!** -- Would have struck the mandate!

&gt;The Court holds that the mandate violates the Commerce Clause

More Commerce Clause: 

&gt;Justice Ginsburg makes clear that the vote is 5-4 on sustaining the mandate as a form of tax. Her opinion, joins the key section of Roberts opinion on that point. She would go further and uphold the mandate under the Commerce Clause, which Roberts wouldn't. Her opinion on Commerce does not control.

Key language re: Commerce Clause: 

&gt;the money quote on the fifth vote to hold that the mandate is not justified under the Commerce Clause (recognizing that doesn't matter because there were five votes under the Tax Power): ""The power to regulate commerce presupposes the existence of commercial activity to be regulated."" That will not affect a lot of statutes going forward.

On the Anti-Injunction Act: 

&gt;The Court holds that the Anti-Injunction Act doesn't apply because the label ""tax"" is not controlling.

Kennedy's dissent: 

&gt;In opening his statement in dissent

**Commentary on Commerce Clause

&gt;The rejection of the Commerce Clause and Nec. and Proper Clause should be understood as a major blow to Congress's authority to pass social welfare laws. Using the tax code -- especially in the current political environment -- to promote social welfare is going to be a very chancy proposition.

At least one SCOTUSblog author disagrees with the above interpretation

&gt;I dissent from Lyle's view that the Commerce Clause ruling is a major blow to social welfare legislation. I think that piece of the decision will be read pretty narrowly.

Footnote 11

&gt;Footnote 11

As to page length: 

&gt;By the way, the four dissenters are 65 pages, followed by a short two-pager from Justice Thomas. You do the math.

As to whether the policy is a good idea: 

&gt;From the beginning of the Chief's opinion: ""We do not consider whether the Act embodies sound policies. That judgment is entrusted to the Nation's elected leaders. We ask only whether Congress has the power under the Constitution to enact the challenged provisions.""",,t5_2qn70,1340896523.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/vqoi4/supreme_court_upholds_the_individual_mandate_as_a/

1349483545.0,110rfz,Dear Republicans,LumbaJack85,53,17,24,"Dearest Republicans

I know today must be tough for you. With the unemployment rate falling below 8% just a month before the election it must feel like a dagger to the heart to see another promise by, don't understand, or both. I say fear because for the segment of republicans that are wealthy, educated, and use FOX news and your SuperPAC dollars to use the rest of the party's ignorance and intolerance to manipulate a group you'll just further disenfranchise with your policies, Obama must be terrifying. A man that lives above the fray, has brown skin, assertions of muslim extremism

But I digress. I would like you all to remember that although it's a horrible day for you it's important to reflect on what just happened. Despite millions of dollars, Barack Obama has led a great nation back from the brink and heading true North once again. Not because he's some sort of messiah, but because he's enabling greatness from a nation full of resilient, amazing people. Greatness, that despite your best efforts to make weak and better position yourselves to exploit us and continue to grow your profits while we suffer, will no longer be suppressed. Side by side with President Obama we're building a new kind of nation. The kind of nation built around righteous values for the many, not protected entitlements for the few.

In a second term we'll see an investment in education, and the middle to the top. We'll also see a new Obama that isn't concerned about trying to reach across the isle in his first year, rather we'll see a man with the nation at his back. 

For those of you standing in opposition on the right we have something to tell you.

If you're working class and think letting the fat cats live large will compel them to spill some crumbs for you open your eyes. Link arms with your peers regardless of skin color

If you're cut from the cloth of the wealthy on the right that has become so effective at manipulating the working class with fear and anger at people that don't look

In short

Sincerely

The ""Lefties"" with deep roots and an open heart.",,t5_2qn70,1349483829.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/110rfz/dear_republicans/
