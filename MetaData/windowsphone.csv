1369064273.0,1ep5uv,"An explanation why WP is ""slow at multitasking"" (spoiler: its not)",AlwaysPaysHisDebts,314,16,128,"I see many people mention that they want to see ""improved multitasking"" in Windows Phone

I want to explain how multitasking works on WP

**Internals**

To understand how this works, `Deactivated` and `Tombstoned`.

* `Active` means that the app is in the foreground and is the current in use app.

* `Deactivated` means that the app is in the background but the OS has not killed it. It is still in memory.

* `Tombstoned` means the deactivated app has been released from memory. A deactivated app is tombstoned when the OS decides it wants the memory the app is using.

I see many people use ""Tombstoned"" to describe apps that are merely deactivated. This makes sense as there is really no way to tell the difference. Tombstoned apps appear in the back-stack, just like deactivated apps. However, internally there is a big difference between the two states.

**Events**

Apps have a number of events, `Application_Activated`, `Application_Closing`.

* `Launching` is when the app is started from scratch

* `Deactivated` is when the app is sent to the background (deactivated)

* `Activated` is when a deactivated *or* tombstoned app is activated

* `Closing` is when the app is closed by pressing the back button only page in the history to exit the app

Code that is run in the Launching event delays the main page being loaded

Just as with Launching, an app may want to log a user in to a remote service during the Activated event, which may take a while over a slow connection. In this instance, the resuming screen will be displayed until that completes.

It is not the OS being ""slow at multitasking"", resuming an app that is tombstoned takes roughly the same time as launching the app to begin with.

The Activated event is run if the app is deactivated or tombstoned. If a deactivated app is resumed

**Reason**

Therefore, however many app developers perform no checks in the Activated event to see if the app needs to be reinitialised or not, and run the code no matter if the app was deactivated or tombstoned. Having the ""resuming"" screen appear every time for some apps, again, creates a perception that Windows Phone is slow at multitasking, when it is actually the app. (Developers can check the value of `ActivatedEventArgs.IsApplicationInstancePreserved` in the Activated event to determine if the app was tombstoned or deactivated).

**Competition**

Now

Because iOS does not tombstone apps; it only deactivates them and then kills them. Therefore, exactly like Windows Phone apps that run no excess code in their Activated event.

When an application is sent to the background on iOS (eg. when the home button is pressed), it kills the app. The app does not preserve its state and cannot resume from where it left off. The next time the app is run -- even if it is accessed from the multitasking bar -- it starts from scratch (eg. shows a splash screen). If iOS worked like Windows Phone, that app would be tombstoned, and the next time it was started from the multitasking bar, it would recover its state (which takes time) and start from where you left off.

**Conjecture**

Now conjecture: which way is better

iOS' way is cleaner and easier on developers. It also avoids developers running unnecessary code every time the app is navigated back to. However

WP's way is a bit messy and harder on developers to implement and get right, the app should always resume from where you left off. Microsoft have tried to create the same sort of experience as on a PC, where when you open a minimized application from the taskbar it starts from where you were, but on a PC the application is maintained in memory the whole time, on lower memory devices like phones, this is not possible, hence the trickery in trying to emulate that experience.

**Fix?**

Can Microsoft ""fix"" the perception of multitasking in WP? Maybe. There are a number of tricks they could do to cover up what is actually happening. Such as,,False,self,t5_2r71o,1369066427.0,,True

It just feels to me like this is the flavor of the week with the tech press and it's getting really annoying. Much like they call out Apple for not meeting lofty demands that some pie-in-the-sky analysts made out (that also have nothing to do with the company), or they're doomed.

I honestly think that switching to Android would doom Nokia harder, no one has really been able to compete with them.

At least in the WP market, Samsung would wipe them off the face of the earth.

Nokia may not be doing so hot on the WP side, only sustain them just as well as staying on WP would.

It just makes me rage because it sounds to me like the pundits crying that Nokia needs to switch to Android are probably the same ones that called for Apple to license Mac OS. Or iOS,False,self,t5_2r71o,False,,phone,t3_1ihuh7

**""CLOSING"" WINDOWS PHONE APPS IS UNNECESSARY

Here's why:

Windows Phone is a very managed platform, and in contrast to how Windows desktop and Android work.  A Windows Phone app is only *running* when it's running, as in, active and displayed on-screen.

Windows Phone *does not* have true multitasking. In fact, they're ""tombstoned,"" which means they're suspended to memory. In a tombstoned state, the app uses no processor, data, or power resources. And if another active app needs to use the memory the tombstoned app is using, WP will silently kill the tombstoned app to free up the memory.

**What *does* use up your battery are background processes**.  This is the method WP uses to allow apps to do things without actually being active and open. Things like downloading live tile data

iOS works the same way, iOS 4?  All hitting the red X in the iOS switching menu does is clear the tombstoned app from memory and force it to restart when you launch it from the home screen.  This is admittedly handy when you have a misbehaving or crashed app, but it doesn't ""close"" the app in a traditional desktop sense.

**TL;DR: Stop telling people to close their apps by hitting the back button

I've been coming to this sub-Reddit for a long time and have been using Windows Phone since I got my old Samsung Focus. One thing that always frustrated me was the lack of one app or another that I'd see my friends using on iPhone and Android.

I experienced this recently with [Splitwise](http://www.splitwise.com) when my friends started using it to keep track of expenses amongst our group. Seeing other Redditors building apps and urging others to ask for apps to be built inspired me--if the Splitwise guys didn't have the resources to do it

It took a bit of work but I finally [released the app](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=d2307de6-10c0-4b5c-9527-7c549370a447) for WP8 earlier this month (and WP7 today!) and the response has been amazing! Hundreds of people are using the app and writing great reviews. My favorite review has been: ""Awesome app. It is comparable to 1st party app on other platforms."" The buzz even got the founders of Splitwise to buy a Windows Phone to check out the app. Mission accomplished!

I guess I just wanted to say thank you to this community for motivating me to make a positive impact on the app ecosystem. I definitely plan to build more apps in the future!

I have been an iPhone user since 2007. I was the guy who queued up at 6pm to get the first ever iPhone. Since then I have been hooked. Getting every single iPhone

I bought the iPhone 5 ( on release day of course ) and after about 4 hours I was bored! Its just the same OS with a bigger screen. So I started looking around for another phone. Finally made my decision 3 weeks back and went for the Lumia 920.

I will give my thoughts and experience; I hope this helps people who are not sure what route to take next with their smartphone.

Hardware:

This was the biggest shock. In-between my iPhone moment I gave the Nokia N900 a go. I took it back the next day. The hardware was shocking. Just felt like cheap plastic. Ok granted

You will not be disappointed with the Lumia 920 hardware. As soon as I got it out of the box and held it I was very pleased. The size and weight was a shock at first, very solid &amp; the slight curved glass is beautiful. I don't have a case yet but I have dropped my phone several times already and it has survived.

The screen is bright and clear. The auto brightness also works very well too.

Camera quality cannot be faulted. 1080p video looks professional &amp; low light pictures also come out much better than iPhone5. The phone is also fitted with a dual LED flash. This makes a surprising difference and gave really clear and rich pictures in low light environments.

Speech is very clear

Built in speakers are decent. Of course they are very high at the treble end but what do you expect from small speakers. The volume is great for incoming calls and messages.

Power cable

Battery

Speed



Software - WP8

I'm a massive Microsoft fan

So the jump from iOS to WP8 was massive.

I give it to Apple; iOS is a very solid OS. It just works. They must of spent hundreds of hours just on the settings layout. But

Then I found this subreddit. Spent about 2 weeks on here reading reviews and speaking to colleagues. I finally took the gamble and sold my iPhone 5 and bought the Nokia Lumia 920.

OS: Elegant, intuitive, sexy, interactive and beautiful.

What a big difference to iOS

The tiles ecosystem is 100% the way to go with smartphones. It just makes perfect sense. Its colourful and useful at the same time.

Live tiles are a brilliant idea

Colour system - there are 20 colour themes to choose from and then the option to switch from dark to light. So giving you 40 options for themes.

Customize

Menu layout. The setting page needs to be looked at. I don't know why they didn't put flight mode at the top. I use that option every night. An option to customize the layout would be nice.

Spell checker / predictive text – Hats off to Microsoft there. It’s very clever. Type the name Arnold and the name “Schwarzenegger” will appear for you to select. Even when typing normal sentences it will get it right most of the time. 

Disk mode – I hated that I had to use itunes to sync my music

In my line of work I use Wi-Fi all the time. The great thing about this phone is that it connect to access points very quickly &amp; supports the use of proxy which not all phones do.

App Store – I know this is a big talking point when it comes to WP8
I could seriously go on for hours but you might get bored. Please

Thanks

So goldegl contacted us anonymously and gave us some more details on what happened

**It was not a redditor that caused trouble.** While posting goldegl's location was definitely not okay, in fact call in or visit or make a complaint. It was a post on MyNokiaBlog, which his superiors saw, and they were able to use the EXIF data to trace it back to goldegl. 

What remains unknown, or if AT&amp;T scans MNB regularly for leaks. If someone in the know has an answer for this (like, AT&amp;T IPs in the server logs), please do post it in the thread.

**goldegl definitely lost his job over this.** Thankfully, but he seemed quite happy about the whole thing in post.

**He knows that not stripping the EXIF was a bad idea.** If you're going to comment on this post basically calling him an idiot for not stripping the EXIF

That's all I've got right now. As for if you have questions for him,,False,self,t5_2r71o,False,,True

After 4.5 years of having iPhones

My thoughts/experiences so far:

*   This thing is FAST. Love the quickness of switching between apps, etc.
* People complaining about the weight are crazy. If you can honestly notice the difference between 6 ounces and 4 ounces
* Live tiles are badass. Having things update on the start screen is just too cool. I just wish more apps had this function. I'm sure as app developers continue to update their apps they will integrate the live tile functions.
* No Spotify yet :( I'm a big Spotify user with a premium account, starred songs, etc.
* Canned Nokia Apps are really good. Nokia Maps and Nokia Drive+ are absolute standouts. A GPS program as good as Nokia Drive+ on iOS would cost a pretty penny
* I was concerned about a lack of Apps initially, or I have found a comparable alternative.
* After heavy use yesterday, had some concerns about the battery life. However today the battery seems to be performing much better after a full night of charge. I've been playing on the phone for 2-3 hours and have only lost about 15% of my charge. Things are looking up in regards to this issue.
* As somebody who hasn't used IE in years

Again I'd like to thank everybody on /r/windowsphone for helping me with my decision and I really hope that WP8 becomes a true contender in the mobile OS arena, that it truly is the best mobile OS available right now.",,False,self,t5_2r71o,False,phone,

1) The Android FEELS more complete.  Hardware wise, 5"" size, and better battery life feels like a AAA phone. The 920 feels REALLY solid and heavy, and in other areas it wins on hardware (camera is much better).  Android software vs WP feels more feature rich: there are key things like podcast management, maintenance, screen rotation lock, and available apps that feel more complete - the last point is especially important.  It's not that I feel starved for apps on wP8, but I often want a capability that either doesn't exist or the API on WP doesn't allow it. Id say 90% of core features are there

2) The Windowsphone

Reading Reddit:  Windowsphone by a lot

Browsing Web:    Android for features (Dolphin with Lastpass)

Taking photos and quality: Windowsphone by a lot

Calls and messaging: Android by a hair

Local search/yelping: Close call between bing local and google now

Podcast playback: Android (Beyondpod) by a mile

Driving directions: Android by a bit

Youtube: Metrotube spanks anything on any other platform

Facebook/Twitter: I love that the built in people hub is all I need. WP by a lot.. I generally love that I need very few 3rd party apps to make the phone feel fully functional. (Android 80+


One last thought on Ecosystem: Microsoft needs to finally merge the Windows Store on Windows 8 and phone so one purchase is the same across all on the same account.  Skydrive is better for photo management in my opinion than the equivalent Picasa setup, give us a skydrive folder to put mp4s in that will appear in xbox video on all platforms along with purchases.

1. Let companies know you would like an App for Windows Phone


2. If you have a bad experience at a store, and make the call.  Be clear you were interested in Windows Phone, and the rep didn't care to listen to your needs.  Make it about the rep's bad skills, and that Windows Phone users have a voice.

This wasn't our first meeting, he mentioned how frustrating the iPhone's keyboard is. He spent a minute or so telling me about how he's used an iPhone for a while, and an Android device as well (one of the Samsung ones, I forget which) as well, and that both keyboards have been a constant source of frustration for him.

He concluded this short tirade with the sentence

I felt like an actor receiving his cue, actually..."" and pulled out my Lumia. I started up OneNote and handed it to him, asking him to try out the keyboard.

He took it and started typing away

After typing, ""It's actually perfect! It got every word!"".

The next few minutes were spent discussing what apps were available

TL;DR Yesterday I learned that the Windows Phone keyboard is a pretty cool guy and doesn't afraid of anything. ",self,t5_2r71o,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/19g355/my_lumia_920_went_through_a_rather_strange_and/

Well I'm here to say that your devs aren't going to abandon you, and we want to help you keep loving your phones. 

I hear the new instagram app by Rudy is going to be amazing. I wish I was as talented as him. Sadly

GDR1 has been out for a good while. GDR2 is rolling out right now. GDR3 is in the wings and WP 8.1 is on the Horizon!

I love you guys

**edit** phew what a morning haha I feel like I've been replying nonstop to messages all day so far! You all have good points and I'm glad to see a lot of you are still in the optimistic spirit like myself :) I hope I haven't personally offended anyone

**edit edit** I'm also very sorry to those of you who thought this was some underhanded attempt to promote my app or cover up the shortcomings of windows phone. I in no way think windows phone is perfect. But the negaitivity and blatant ignorance of how updates on other OSes work put me in a tizzy. iOS gets an update maybe once a year. iOS 6 was barely different from iOS 5 except for the change to apple centered apps instead of Google. And most users hated that. The rest of the update were just refreshes of their already baked in apps, I personally promise.

Also, do they? I don't know hahah) Because if they don't, then that is a huge plus for Xbox Music. ",,False,self,t5_2r71o,,http://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/1k9w95/something_positive_for_our_subreddit_to_counter/

In 6 minutes with the S4, and twice the RAM on the Lmuia, I managed, again in only 5-6 minutes, I managed to:

1- Notice scrolling lag in many apps and even in contact list

2- See how cluttered the phone is

3- Scrolling lag if abusing the home screen.

4- I was browsing Gamespot and IGN on desktop mode, so for me a controlled purposefully slower scroll of the 920 has the better results. At the top of IGN.COM the S4 would stutter like a bitch after coming there top speed from the bottom.

5- After I closed the Android browser I pressed camera app and the phone froze for 2-3 seconds COMPLETELY before the camera launched.

6- Typing lag

Those 6 minutes just sum up Android for me

Oh, videos and music.

That's always been my opinion on Android

I'll take some shit from Microsoft, and this alone is a gigantic advantage. It's butter smooth, and insanely consistent.



EDIT: Seeing that this thread has quite a few replies, first time smartphone user, I got her a Lumia 620 and she loves it, the thing flies. If she had gotten an S4 it would slow down to a halt after 2-3 months because Android lacks robust controls and the OS is overrun with unnecessary shit. 

I think the Android approach is more suitable for PCs, something everyone learned from Apple. We do get some shit from this with restricted APIs and what not, but as the OS proves itself I reckon some restrictions will go, until Microsoft sees how much it can push things without breaking the OS, just like Apple.

As for an ""untouched Google experience"", is optimized to the limits. I still found it well, let's say clumsy. I always expected the phone to disappoint me, and it often did. I know it's not the newest nor the greatest Android, but when a Lumia 620, heck even 520!

Now, a la the hate that was slung at Apple for ""banning gay sex"", when in fact it was revealed that there was never a ban in the first place), or saying something that is *very* obviously biased. 

If you're going to link an article or even your own article: Please link articles that are bias-free in their reporting and are well sourced. Do not link sensationalist garbage that is written to rile people up and/or generate page views. That stuff doesn't belong here. It reflects poorly on the community.

The second thing I want to talk about is **fanboyism**. This is something I've been against since day one here, but I'd like to make sure it stays that way. Sure, *you* (and everyone else here, because that's why we're here, right?) may think that WP8 is superior, but by no means is it for everyone. There's a reason that WP8, Android, and we need to respect that.

If you hate the iPhone, not about the other platforms and how *they're* doing. If you're going to link something or start a selfpost with the sole intention to circlejerk about how Microsoft rules and everyone else sucks, your post is probably getting removed. We can be passionate about Windows Phone without stooping to that level. We're awesome like that. Let's keep it that way.

Lastly, I do pay attention to the queue, so if you notice anything that needs my attention, report it or mark it as spam and I'll go right over to it. Or just message me with a link to the offending thread. Either way will work.

Thanks for your guys' patience thus far. I'm trying to work on things as quickly as I can (and not die of illness

MSFT has only a few aces up their sleeves before competition catches up and they have continued to bungle their way forward. Let's take these one by one. 

1) Skype - It may help to know that Skype was purchased in 2011 and yet they have been unable to integrate it properly into the WP framework. Deep integration into the ""People"" hub is but one of the discontinuous experiences they could have created but yet it's nowhere near completion. 

2) Xbox - One would imagine MSFT could have pushed hard to bring ""first to the world"" play on any device and have a seamless experience across PCs, this has not happened. Aside from achievements and gamer score, I'm still not sure what's the point of Xbox live status games. And don't get me started on xbox video and xbox music both of which are disasters on WP right now. 

3) Enterprise support - This is mindboggling really as this should be an easy win for MSFT with the IT professionals who matter. Instead


Not only is the pace of news and innovation extraordinarily slow on MSFT's end, Nokia is already pushing the upper level of specs on their phones and are now fast becoming constrained by MSFT.

BUT still tied to Google searches, Gtalk, Picasa/Plus+, Chrome, and Google Music.

So here is what I did:

**Email**: visit outlook.com and connect in your gmail account as a 'send and receive' account.  This appears to be a new feature - it lets outlook.com and your W8 desktop mail client work with gmail seamlessly and download your message history too.  

**Messaging:**  When outlook.com and the desktop messaging app are connected to Google

**Contacts:** goto contacts.google.com, click the down arrow at the top left and select people, then import from file.

**Music:**  Download google play music manager and download your library.  Then load XBOX music desktop client and load those files for the matching service.  This can be very manually intensive

**Chrome:** I found that the main features i needed with chrome were in IE10 which has made leaps in improvements over old IE7.  I found myself enjoying its simplicity as a built-in feature to windows.  I needed tracking lists to simulate adblock, i just started using Reddit on Redhub Metro app instead.

**Google Drive:**  I moved everything in Google Drive over to Skydrive using the cloud migration service at mover.io.  I didnt have to download and reupload

**Pictures!** - I had a lot of these.  Skydrive $10 / 20gb yearly covered it though, it was cloud copied to skydrive in the previous step.

**Google Search:**  Surprisingly easy to give up.  I googled so much for the past 8 years I thought i could never live with bing but it kinda felt cool to be on one ecosystem and i found the quality of the searches absolutely on par with google

**Google Voice:**  I CANT QUIT YOU.  Microsoft

**Added note:**  As google is deprecating the awesome iGoogle home page next fall

Microsoft

About three weeks ago I dropped my phone on the street.

Most of us will drop our phones at one point or another. iPhones tend to have their screens break mid-air due to the panic attacks the phones have before they even hit the ground. They're just that fragile. Androids do anything from tell the ground to go **** itself and bounce away harmlessly to shattering into a thousand pieces. Such is the way of the Great Google™. The screen on a Lumia 920s? They're slippy. Real slippery. So slippery, and the damn phone has the potential to move on its own due to the sheer brilliance of its LCD coating. It's actually rather scary at times.

That established, I bit my lip. THE HORROR!

I hesitantly picked up my phone

Years ago, my parents got better. Last night, when I picked up my phone, the black scuff marks on the phone fell off. That's right. The dark black marks the phone picked up when it smashed into the street just peeled off on their own. My only assumption is that the phone itself rejected the sheer concept of being damaged. And the screen? The scratches are nearly gone. From where I could feel them before, now they're barely visible, like they outright healed themselves. 

Not sure how, but at this point, I'm pretty sure that Nokia's phones are protected by Ukko, the Finnish lord of thunder. Whatever the case may be, Nokia phones obviously continue their legendary status even today.

I love my Windows Phone now more than ever.",self,t5_2r71o,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/15wxpb/a_tale_of_the_lumia_920s_durability/

Then I 'upgraded' to a Lumia 920, I'm excited for the potential of the OS, and I was under the impression that XBM was just a facelift, but the loss of the Zune software to sync (I'm on Win7) has been a total letdown.

The WP8 sync software for Win7 is, I would be HUMILIATED to even be associated with it. The level of functionality when compared to Zune is, wait, there is no comparison. MS themselves recommend using iTunes (!!!!!!!!!) to manage podcasts! Unreal. Wireless sync is a distant memory. 

I personally have reverted to Windows Fucking Media Player just to sync a playlist with the device. However

I think what really blows my mind is that here is a company who spends hundreds of millions of dollars on development, advertising etc. etc. just to get a phone in my hand and at the end of the day, I can't listen to my downloaded copy of Akon's 'Smack That.'

1352569654.0,12yy4g,The Truth about the Nokia Lumia 920 - My User Review,krazykoo,98,21,61,"Hey everyone! As you know I was answering a lot of questions about the Lumia 920 these past few days since I was fortunate enough to pick on up in Canada on Tuesday. After having the device for half a week I'd like to outline all aspects of the device and what I've come to know it by. I will touch the good aspects which make me love the phone

As a quick introduction of myself, and BBA Finance. I'm now working as a Marketing Manager for a SharePoint software solutions company in Seattle/Dubai. I've been looking forward to this phone ever since they announced WP8 (Apollo), and even more so once Nokia unveiled it in early September. For the past two years I've been using a Samsung Focus which I purchased on released day back in 2010--so I'm one of the original WP users, and even had my fair share of WinMobile devices before that such as an HP iPaq.

The not so great:

(1) Cable Placement. 
Compared to the focus

(2) Volume. 
I know everyone was asking about this

(3) Speaker Placement.
When watching videos on the device and using external speakers it just doesn't feel right. Both speakers are at the bottom of the device and produce one-sided sound. I actually find this distracting to listen to at times.

(4) Speaker Quality.
I tend to like high-end audio devices--such as this amp and Tannoy speaker set just for my desktop computer. The speakers on the Lumia 920 produce little to no bass which produces an unbalanced sound. Although I would never expect a small, or various other mobile devices it comes up short. The result is a slightly 'tin' sound.

(5) Device size.
It's quite large. Even in comparison to the 4.1"" Samsung Focus, I'm including it in this section because sometimes it is just hard to pick up or hold with one hard. Sometimes it even hard just to get it out of my pocket, then fear dropping it once I do get it out. 

The 'I don't really care about':

(1) Device weight.
This is the one aspect everyone has been talking about with this phone. But you know what? I actually couldn't care less. It's not like I'm not worried that I can't walk as far as I could with a lighter phone because its weighing me down. Phone weight is something that one company (*cough*, then I won't ever care. And remember, I went from the Focus to the 920. And the Focus was the lightest WP.

(2) Top of the device flexes.
Most of you will not have known this, and the fact I have to hold the phone in such a specific way to even see this effect. By no means does it take away from the solid feel of the phone, and it doesn't feel any cheaper because no one will ever know unless you tell them.

(3) Vibrate.
Its very quiet, and I'd actually rate it as the quietest vibrate out of any phone I've used anyway.

What works well:

(1) Aesthetics.
The phone is gorgeous. It's simple yet elegant. Similar to the look of the 800 and 900 the 920 maintains a really simplistic, and isn't cold to the touch like an iPhone. The front of the device has a very professional glossy screen.

(2) Screen.
The screen on this phone is truly amazing. With the resolution of a 15.6"" laptop in a 4.5"" screen the pixel density (332ppi) creates an awesome user-experience. Web pages are amazing to browse on this phone because you can see everything without having to zoom in much, the AMOLED screens tend to have way higher contrast as well. For a high-end IPS panel the Lumia 920 seems to pull it off. The colors are quite rich, and the 'black' portions of the screen doesn't have insane backlight leak like a cheap HP laptop. When viewed directly on actually you can't even notice the edges of the screen--similar to AMOLED. The refresh rate is also noticeable! at 60hz with the 1.5 dual-core processor scrolling is a bit more fluid. Sometimes refresh rates are hard to nice if you've never seen the difference. As I actually use both 60hz and 120hz monitors when working my eye has been taught to see the difference (and yes, 120hz is truly the most epic computer experience you can get).

(3) Camera.
Outstanding. I've always been a skeptic of mobile cameras, full frame DSLR's all the way! Or at least a point &amp; shoot camera over a phone right? Well, maybe not anymore. Although I would not replace any of my actual cameras for the one on the Nokia, I can certainly say the 920 is the first mobile devices that its been close enough for me to consider that. And in many situations, I probably will give up taking a small point &amp; shoot where I don't need an DSLR. The quality of photos the 920 takes is truly amazing. They are crip, clean, and mostly-importantly: sharp. To really show you what I'm talking about. [check out this picture](http://i.imgur.com/3UuwU.jpg) that was taken in a 100% black room around 2AM last night. This was using the flash and flash-focus assist. It looks like daytime, the finish picture is about 60% brighter than when it shows on the screen right before you take it. Most mobile devices produce a darker pictures lol.

(4) Call quality.
Actually really good! And its easy to hear in loud places as well. I made lots of call in public the last few days and had phenomenal results. Way better than the focus for sure.

(5) Front-facing camera.
Amazing to have finally! By no means is this camera the quality of the rear one though.

(6) Flashlight.
For all of those out there that use flashlight apps

(6) Hardware performance.
This one is hard to report on without bringing the aspect of software in

(7) Nokia Apps.
As with the 800/900 Nokia has included a bunch of applications on the phone, Nokia Maps, Nokia City Lens, Nokia Drive, Nokia Transport, Panorama, and Smart Shoot. Of these, drive

(8) Signal Strength.
In comparison to other phones and devices

(9) Battery Life.
This question is going to be extremely difficult to answer. As I've mentioned above I travel a lot, it's hard to express. The best test for this is going to be this upcoming week as I'll be down in Las Vegas for a conference and WILL be away from chargers most of the day.

What I've noticed: the battery life is 'reasonable' for everything that the phone has it in. I mean, and have seven email addresses set to sync 'as items arrive'. I'm also always on it sending/receiving calls, and its always in front of me helping me work. 

With all this said, many text messages, answered emails, browsed the web, and read updates on various stock/investing applications. I didn't play any games, and had WiFi off the entire time. For me, this is pretty normal of a phone, I would expect them to start at 100% when you leave in the morning and grasp on to their life in the last 10% when you get back home. This is one of those phones I think. It will get you through the day just fine

I'll update this battery section again throughout next week while I'm in the states.


(10) Although this is software related, Zunepass just got a bit more epic with cloud-synchronization of music. What does this mean exactly? I can download music on either my Win8 desktop, Win8 laptop, or WP8 and automatically have it download and sync to all of my devices. I pay only $10/mo and have access to millions of songs of which I can download as many as I'd like. I can stream music to any of these devices from the cloud, or download them for offline use and saving data. Not many people know about Zune Pass (XBOX music) these days in comparison to say, iTunes method of music. The fact is though, this is the only affordable way consumers can have music, and now I'm blown away by the ability to share unlimited music. --and keep in mind too

The Verdict:

I really don't like reviews because they always push their views onto consumers. I hope what I've done in simply provide a perspective on the device which you can take and form your own opinion. And again

EDIT: Holy crap I wrote a lot.

I've been a Windows Phone user for almost a year now, I see a lot of people complaining about features that turn it into a copy of android. Sure, there are some functionality things that I understand (such as VPN or orientation lock) and hope will be addressed in an update. Then there are other suggestions (like a notification center) that undermine the principle of the OS. The live tiles are there so you can unlock your phone and immediately see ""Oh, I have two missed calls, a text, and 3 emails."" There are 5 basic notification spots and one detailed spot on the WP8 lockscreen, and you're free to arrange your live tiles however you wish. I'm sure that if there are things that you need immediate notifications about

The fact that other programs can't have access to much except for their own live tiles is probably why WP8 is a really secure platform. Developers having access to a central part of the operating system could be one of the reasons Andriod is having problems with security holes.

Again, please don't try to turn it into Android with a bunch of features the rest of us don't really want.

Thanks!

Edit: Several of the comments below have indicated that this post comes across as a cultish mindset, but on all the other websites as well), they seem to want the Android experience on a Windows Phone. For example, when suggesting a way to implement a notification center, I hear so many people wanting to swipe down from the top of the screen and have the center, exactly the way Android does. When Windows does have a notification center, I hope that it will be an original concept that blends in with the rest of the theme of WP8. That's all I'm trying to say.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/138ucp/windows_phone_android/

The Facebook app sucks but go ask r/android or r/ios how there Facebook app is. At least with windows phone I can get basic Facebook tasks integrated into the platform.

are there design elements I wish were a bit different or UI elements that I wish were a bit different? Sure.. But I had issues with android too. And I hate IOS.

I had gotten my Lumia 920 in November

Fast forward to May, and Camera buttons stop working. I follow some troubleshooting steps on AT&amp;T's site, they say factory reset. I do so. The phone wouldn't finish resetting, just the gears spinning on the screen. And it stayed this way until the battery ran down. I charged it, and got nothing but spinning gears.

So I call up AT&amp;T, send the problem child back, done.

Or so I thought.

Now the replacement phone would ""charge"" but WP8 wouldn't tell me it retained or gained any new charge %. I reset the phone (Hello, and voila, the battery is magically charged to 100%.

So now she's like ""okay well are there any other problems with the phone? Do you enjoy using it?"" Etc. My only complaint has been the mail app (I use gmail and it just doesn't stack up to the android gmail app :/).

She then tells me ""You know what

What.

This has come up a few times in the past, I also know from experience (and I also live in Silicon Valley) that selling and or trading Windows Phones is immensely difficult. I've seen ads on Craigslist go for weeks without a potential buyer because it seems like no one wants to buy them.

Hence

It would not matter what you are trading or selling for what as long as a Windows Phone is somewhere in the equation. Do you want to trade your 920 for a Galaxy S3 or vice versa? No problem

Would anyone be interested in such a thing? Please let me know in the comments!
