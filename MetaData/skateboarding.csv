This is about dealing with cops/security IN THE UNITED STATES. Just a bit of advice for you dealing with them

-first off


-They are allowed to stop you


-Cops are allowed to search you


-They are not allowed to take your skateboard or any of your gear. This is your personal property and is protected by the 4th amendment.  If they try to take anything


-If they are not going to arrest you


-You are allowed to take pictures and record them with cameras. this is due to the 1st amendment

It's been in storage for a couple of years and since my skatin' days are over I wanted to give it to some kid who will put it to good use. I'm pretty new to Reddit and since I have fallen in love with the community here I thought this was the best place to give them away. It's not much but it's a nice little gift for some skating hopeful. If you or maybe one of your kids want them just leave a comment stating why. I will put names in a hat and select someone at random. And please this is only for kids in the US since I will be shipping it myself and you will have to be comfortable with giving me your address if chosen. Thanks and happy skatin'! 

*2nd Update: I didn't really expect to get this much responses over these shoes so I think it's unnecessary to wait until tomorrow to pull names. So I'm cutting it off and going to pull names now. Be right back with the results.*
