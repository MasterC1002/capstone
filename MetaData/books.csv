Our vision for this subreddit is to be a hub for general discussion about books, since images rise much more quickly. Banning them will hopefully promote more discussion based posts to make it to the front page.

Banning memes was an easy call to make. In a community based around books, easy to digest image macros. This was also an easy decision to make because it was expressed vehemently by a lot of comments in today's thread, and in many threads in the past.

An important distinction that I wish to express is that we will still allow for image based posts

Many users have asked us to make this sub self-post only, reviews, interviews, and many other link posts are very supportive of discussion, and if you look at our front page on a regular basis, you will see that links like these make up a large amount of the upvoted content.

This post linked to 10+ ""Top 100"" book lists from sources such as TIME magazine, and such different ways of being presented that I wanted to amalgamate all of these into one master ""list"" in order to compare them (thirteen lists in total since I also added in the first 100 of the Reddit's 200 favorite books). I have since thrown this into a [pdf file on Scribd](http://www.scribd.com/doc/155522409/13-Top-100-Book-Lists-Put-in-One-Place) if anyone is interested. My next step was to compare each of these and see what books are most recommended in top lists. I omitted two lists (100 most influential books ever written and 100 Major works of creative nonfiction) since there was VERY LITTLE overlap between the other lists which were primarily fiction. I made one giant list that combined 11 ""Top 100"" Book Lists. The

Because housing all these books is now costing more than she or her business can afford, nobody wants that.

I know reddit is (rightly so) critical of help requests. Money is not the goal of this post, here is where you can find it:

22442 72nd Ave S

Here is her website: http://www.oncesoldtales.com/ where you can order something to get shipped out.

Here is a photo album: http://imgur.com/a/WnlQU

Carrie will be operating her website and selling books at the warehouse (1$ for paperbacks, she will. She is going to be offering reddit a special deal if there is interest. I'd be lying if I said the idea wasn't mine. Details are still getting worked out but it looks like 10 dollars for 8 books or 18 for 16. Details forthcoming as well as how to actually make the order. (price includes all taxes and shipping for continental US, so the plan goes atm)

(EDIT: Product being offered to reddit is a grab-bag

(EDIT2: More details for the grab bag are being requested. Specifically kids books. Since they are way lighter and the bag pricing is dictated by shipping costs (there is really little overhead sadly) a kids books selection would have way more books. No clue on specific. Stay tuned)

(EDIT3 The reddit grab bag is  not live yet. Purchases from the site are full price and there is not yet the opportunity to buy things super discounted online. Please

(EDIT4: I'm a moron. Thats pretty standard

(**EDIT5**: There are too many responses! Holy cow, but I WILL be back and I WILL have more answers to more questions. This includes shipping internationally, options to donate money/books, and of course specifics for the reddit grab bag. Goodnight reddit, thanks for helping Carrie find a home for her books)

FULL DISCLOSURE: I used to read books all the time and when I found out about what Carrie is going through, let me know why (might as well get better at it). Carrie is hard to get a hold of, but I will do my best to help answer questions, update the post with as much info as I can, and pass along anything you would like me to.

EDIT: I'm positive my wife (and all the local libraries) just got enough Ender's Games - however if you still would like to help these kids out there are a lot of fabulous suggestions for different books by other Redditors in the comments:

The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian by Sherman Alexie
Monster by Walter Dean Myers
The Giver by Lois Lowry

**A big Thank You to all who commented and upvoted. My wife came home from work today where she had one of ""her worst days ever"" with fights

As evidenced by the amount of upvotes and positive comments the post received

This subreddit is regularly used as a medium for marketing, bots, or direct sale links. You may not see very much of it, since most of it gets deleted by either the spam filter or by the mods, but if you are a regular reader of this subreddit, chances are you have seen some. The mod team defines spam as anything that aims to sell or promote a user's own work, and while the post in question was directly doing neither

Letting one promotional post slide sets a precedent for other promoters on this subreddit

Promoting you own work is tough, that counts as sharing, and is a wonderful thing for a community such as this. But when you are watermarking images, and posting discount codes and sale links for your website, that becomes spam.

1352740110.0,132ivr,12 Books You Could Read That Might Change Your Mind,sartorialconundrum,1818,477,388,"So, these lists are geared this way because it makes it easier to argue about a list, but it is nearly impossible to dispute a list that merely wants to be a list of *books I have read that I think you all might enjoy if this is your sort of thing*. This explains a lack of this kind of list: we can't fight over a list like this

However, and I have already rejected him as a candidate for my next reading adventure. What I need is a list of books that are *also good*, but not typically very well known. This means that a list like this cannot, as a matter of first principals, be a list of the best. 

So, without any more rambling on my part, I give you: **Sartorialconundrum's list of twelve books that might help you change the way you think about things**. 

The idea behind this list is that each of them take a different view than the established ideology in their field, history, science, economics, literature, and journalism. 

* The Structure of Scientific Revolutions
* The Golden Bough
* The Assault
* The Skeptic
* America's Great Depression
* The Republic
* The God of Small Things
* Financial Reckoning Day
* Selected Poems
* Lanark
* Orlando
* The Dangling Man

Everything is this list is a little off. Some you might never have heard of (Lanark), while another deals with ambiguity in modern life (The Dangling Man). 

If you are looking for something different

Regards

**Edit**: As one comment corrected me

**PS** I am glad this got such a good response. I would like to see more of this collaboration. Arguing over what is in the canon is boring. Talking about books is not boring.

**In a bad way** - The most recent example for me was *The Wise Man's Fear* by Patrick Rothfuss.  In my view, though, had me drained and lexically listless - I will probably be able to read once more in a week or two, when the sourness wears off. 

**In a good way** - When I finished the Foundation series, lost the motivation to eat or drink.  I was also slightly morose that the author hadn't written any more books.  But then, even 20 books in the series wouldn't have been enough.  It was much after this time that I bothered to learn *about* the author, and explore more of things he had written.  (I was a fool and didn't know that Asimov was a famous person).

I never responded to the review (it's always a bad thing if an author does) nor did I ask any of my fans to do so (but nonetheless several who have liked the book did)

I'm not upset with the reviewer (I've grown a thick skin and I realize that everyone has their right to their own opinion) but the review itself and this comment does bring up an interesting point.

After being profesionally published for nearly a year and selling more than 150, at least to my mind, a rather futile exercise.  There is no universal criteria that all readers, critics, and literature professors can agree upon to separate ""good"" from ""bad."" And I don't think the opinion of a reader bears more weight if they have extensively studied 'literature.""  But there seems to be an almost pavlovian response by some people that say if a book is popular, it must automatically be crap.

As an author I think trying to determine my book as ""good"" or ""bad"" is folly.  I'm more than satisfied with the fact that the vast majority who have actually read it were entertained and found it a good investment in both their time and money.

1. Don't tell others how to read. Some people like to read 100 books a year, that's a good thing. There's nothing more elitist than looking down on others for not having the same taste as you.

2. Reading is just a medium; it's not better than other mediums. I read because I like using my imagination, they've just chosen a different medium to deliver their thoughts.

3. Write in the margins. There's so much you don't get when you're not doing this. As well

4. Read books you love more than once. People who say that there are far too many books in the world to ever spend the time rereading a book don't seem to realize that they will die before they have read every book in the world anyway. You'll probably die before you read every book on your bookshelf. If you love a book

5. Don't worry about what you're supposed to get from the novel

6. However

7. Partake in easy reading every now and then. Tom Robbins, Christopher Moore, Chuck Klosterman, David Sedaris, and so on. Reading Faulkner, DeLillo, Joyce, Gaddis

8. If something sucks

9. Pay attention to the author's use of language. Simile

10. Share with others the books you have enjoyed. Hopefully they will enjoy them as well. The community of readers is almost as important as the books themselves. Be a part of that community.

EDIT: For those who do not understand the title of this post, I think I'd rather you not write in the margins of a book. And damn, why's everything have to be an argument on Reddit?

A word about the tone.  Many of you attacking me haven't read the whole thread or have ignored the fact that I admitted the outburst above was childish and petulant.  It was.  But I thought it would have been disingenuous of me to change it.  It seems however that perhaps I should draw particular attention to this by editing the main post

I regret the use of invective.  I regret targeting particular posts (not explicitly

I am not sorry about raising the topic though.  It's a valid point.  I guess I was just irritable yesterday morning.  Such posts are rare for me.

Update: There's been a great response so far. Here's the list for those asking: The Monster Hunter Hunter Trilogy by Larry Correia; The Walking Dead Compendium 1 by Robert Kirkman; Anansi Boys, Smoke and Mirrors, and Fragile Things by Neil Gaiman; Watchers and Prodigal Son by Dean Koontz; High Fidelity by Nick Hornby; Go Mutants by Larry Doyle; Reckless by Cornelia Funke; The Strain by Guillermo Del Toro; H.P. Lovecraft: The Complete Fiction; Eragon and Eldest by Christopher Paollini; Vampirates by Justin Somper; The Lightning Thief and The Sea of Monsters by Rick Riordan; Pride Prejudice and Zombies by Seth Grahame Smith; Dawn of the Dreadfuls by Steve Hockensmith; Everythings Eventual by Steven King and I don't know if it counts but The Skyrim Prima Guide.
  
I have bought and paid for the majority of these with my own money that I earned doing work.

The options I've seen so far are: give them to friends (This was what I was originally considering); A few people have offered to come take them (I'd say this along with the first are my best option. Also I'd get to make a new Reddit friend who's close by); try harder to convince (It won't work); Tell him if he wants to get rid of them he has to burn them

Update 2: I didn't expect it to get this big

Someone mentioned Fahrenheit 451, ""Oh whatcha readin there? What's that about?"" and I get to tell him haha. 

I got a lot of great advice and good arguments to use that I will bring up but for now things are looking up if only a little.

Edit: Here's the books he's letting me keep: The Catcher in the Rye by J. D. Salinger; The Complete Sherlock Holmes by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle; The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller; I'm Dying Up Here by William Knoedelseder; Seriously Funny by Gerald Nachman; Comedy at the Edge by Richard Zoglin; A Great Silly Grin by Humphrey Carpenter; Hells Angels by Hunter S. Thompson; The Difference Engine by William Gibson; The Battle of the Labyrinth by Rick Riordan; The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins; Incognito by David Eagleman; A Game of Thrones and A Storm of Swords by George R. R. Martin; Off the Mangrove Coast by Louis Lamour; The Sun Going Down by Jack Todd; 1Q84 by Haruki Murakami; Tales of Mystery and Terror by Edgar Allen Poe; The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams; Homeland by R. A. Salvator; Scott Pilgrim 1-6 by Brian Lee O'mally.

     The world has changed, but the present incumbent in The White doesn't seem to know it. His advisors don't seem to know it.

 It used to be that what happened in New York and Washington was important in Paramaribo, things have changed. Now we know that what happens in Santiago, in Tehran, in Mali is terribly important in New York and Washington. Nothing is more important

The Third World, inconsequential. Whether we like it or not, the world is becoming covered with a network of fine, sensitive nerves - an electronic nervous system not unlike that which integrates our own bodies. Our finger hurts, our toe hurts and we feel it as much as if our head aches or our heart aches. Instantly now do we feel the pain in Montevideo, in Judah, in Bandung. And yes, we feel the pain from our own

There is no First World

You and I know there is no theology, total integration of the world. Christianity has had two thousand years to tie this world together... and it has not done so. Islam has had six hundred years to tie this world together... and it has not done so. American democracy has had two hundred years to tie this world together... and it has not done so. Communism had nearly one hundred years to tie this world together...and it did not do so.
 You and I know what is tying this world together, ever have or could; better than any marching armies ever have or could.

 Today
You and I, is integrating this world in a way no theology, no ideology ever could. Technology is forming a nervous system beneath the skin of Mother Earth. And you and I know that to avoid the pain, the body politic had better start responding to this nervous system immediately! If we ignore that which hurts in any part of body earth, we shall suffer years more, generations more of the pain and misery of spreading disease. If we knowingly allow wounds to fester in any particular place, the strength
     American politics must grow up to the new realities of life on this planet! Technology brings us closer than any Biblical brothers! Technology makes us more interdependent than any scheme of capital and labor! Technology is integrating the people of this earth where love and force have failed! This is the new reality! We must seize this understanding! Seize it for peace! For the health of planet earth! My friends

I see a lot of posts by redditors and their friends about how excited they are about being ""self-published.""  I hate to say this

Let's look at the word ""published"" first.  The mistake ""self-publishers"" make is equating ""hard copy of book"" (or ebook equivalent) with ""published.""  Thus

Nononno!  Being published is not just about having a hard copy of one's work - that misses the forest for the trees.  Being published is about convincing a third party that your work is worthwhile enough to support and make public.  It's about earning the respect of a group completely independent of you and having them fund the dissemination of your ideas.

For a novelist this means convincing a publishing company, you get the idea.  The bottom line is that real publishing means passing a critical threshhold: your work earning the respect of someone 100% unrelated to you.  There are standards you have to meet or exceed to move on.

When you go to iuniverse or Amazon and ""self-publish"" all you're doing is printing out a copy of your work.  There's no acceptance by unrelated peers - there's no meeting of minimum standards of your field, whatever - it's just a print shop.  Anyone with the money can print up their work.

This misunderstanding that ""self-publish"" = ""publish"" might not matter to the casual writers, and if you skip the parts where you have to meet minimum standards, or earn the respect of your peers in an established publishing capacity, you're skipping the hard work.  You'll never, ever get better like that and you won't get any closer to a real, published result.

When someone sees a publishing company logo on a work, that's independent verification.  When you have iuniverse on your work, all people see is that you paid money to print up a hard copy of your work.  That approval from the literary field at large (or your work's niche in it) is not there.

So, etc. - frankly it makes you look silly and all you're doing is avoiding the real hard work of publishing and sabotaging your own progress.",,False,self,t5_2qh4i,False,,

Here's the deal. I'm probably 3/4-4/5 through Dune (just past the start of part 3)

Sure, and the tale is told as an epic story of grand political schemes and personal character growth, but I'm just not finding the book to be fun to read.

The update is here! Thanks for being so patient. First though

""Once Sold Tales was started by another man, so he sold us the 12,000 books and business for 10% of the year's profits. In 2005, Eric Jenott wrote some software to manage the inventory and competitively reprice it, effectively making us competitive with the largest and most prestigious software companies and online book sellers. Within a month, sales had quintupled. We got employees and they worked in our basement to list books for sale and ship them. We started working with libraries and Friends of the Library groups early on, helping their organizations get money for the online sales of their books. We paid them 35% for their online sales, and soon were working with public libraries, thrift stores,000 books in our basement to over 1/2 Million books in 30

We have had a lot of fun. We threw a ""Tolkien &amp; Tea"" Bilbo Baggins birthday party and had a projector show all 3 extended versions of the Lord of the Rings on our warehouse wall while we served tea and ""elevensies"" to all who came

We also did a lot of cool things, and their dad reads to them every night and now they are proficient and avid readers. THAT makes it all worth it. We changed the world, one life at a time. 

Once Sold Tales was not only helping the community, we were fairly impoverished and going to the food bank. I can appreciate hard times and we never wanted there to be an economic barrier to children having access to books. Our staff have also been positively impacted by Once Sold Tales. At least 2 sets of couples have met at Once Sold Tales, and one has already married. Young staff who are often students have been able to pay for college and cars and have gained leadership and business experience from working at Once Sold Tales. Our turnover rate was ridiculously low - especially for the industry - as so many people loved working here. Recently, 2 people have bought homes. We help each other out. We celebrate birthdays and have a generous sick day policy - because life happens. I hope I can find another place to work that is half as awesome as it was to work at Once Sold Tales.... I'm going to miss the people so much and they have promised that we're going to have regular get togethers so we can keep enjoying each other's company. We're crazy, and we like it that way. :-) 

I've been working at Once Sold Tales for 9 years - since the beginning. I am a self taught marketer, Bookstore manager, sales rep, customer service, software &amp; warehouse process developer, website designer, and partner organization liaison. I just generally call myself the ""Business Developer"" but now that we're an LLC, I was a homeschooling mom of 5. And through all this.....I was still a homeschooling mom of 5. :-) 

Asking me what is my favorite book is akin to asking me which is my favorite child... I enjoy an eclectic variety, anything by Robert Louis Stevenson, C. S. Lewis, Yeats, Keats, Longfellow, Ralph Waldo Emerson, even though it keeps me up all night because I can't put it down and it's frightened my overactive imagination. I thoroughly enjoyed ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead"" and ""Catch-22 by Joseph Heller"" (not so much his other books). I like Charles Dickens and Daniel Defoe. The Three Musketeers. Adventure novels like what Jack London and Gary Paulson writes. Imaginative works that inspire like things by Madeline L'Engle. I'm hoping to read ""Master and Commander"" and other books by Patrick O'Brian next. I keep meaning to read ""The Wheel of Time"" series by Robert Jordan and have mutually enjoyed the works of Brian Jacques with my kids. I also think I want to read ""Ender's Game"" by Orson Scott Card. I like dramatized history and the occasional biography. I like some classics. But not

We have a common rant at Once Sold Tales, selfish things. I particularly dislike stories about dysfunctional families or women, chasing after dysfunctional men, and often it all coming to ruin. That would include almost all ""romance"" novels, Gone With The Wind, Anna Karenina, Madame Bovary, Doctor Zhivago

At our busiest,000 books a day. Not too bad for our little company. ""

~~DETAILS (I did promise)~~

~~Product: Standard Reddit Grab Bag~~

~~Sizes: Small or Large **EDIT** *Bags will have maximum weight of 4 and 8 lbs respectively*~~

~~Contents: Approximately 8 or 16 mass market paperbacks~~

~~Level 0 Categories: Adventure

~~Level 1 Categories:  Science Fiction, Westerns, Romance, Young Adult~~

~~Level 2 Categories:  Whatever you request (Authors, Carrie and crew will do their best)~~

~~COST: 10$ or 18$. SHIPPING INCLUDED FOR CONTINENTAL U.S.~~

===

~~Product: Children's Reddit Grab Bag~~

~~Size: Small or Large~~

~~Contents: As many books as can fit~~

~~COST: 12$ or 20$~~

~~**IMPORTANT NOTE** Do **NOT** go to the website for a grab bag! The website is already bogged down enough

~~INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING:  
	Is a pain. Even just across the border to Canada. Right now, sound off in the comments about what you think works best. Maybe a ""Here is X dollars, send me as many books as you can!"" deal. This will be updated and decisions will be made.~~

~~HOW TO PURCHASE:  
	Paypal is the way to pay. All payments to be made to REMOVED. Subject should be your products and the optional message is not optional. Make certain to share your category selections

Check the album in this post for an example: http://imgur.com/a/8wha3

~~HOW TO DONATE:~~
	~~I don't know! Paypal does have a Donate button, but getting the money later has been difficult for others. If you have a suggestion, put it out there and I will find a best solution. Temporary solution: Buy a small random bag of books and beyond the 10$ price, include an itemized 'handling' fee of your choice. You still get books, but also contribute. Then, when the books arrive you donate them, since you are already awesome. If against Paypal TOS

~~GIVING BOOKS:  
	Have a friend or library that could use books,  just make sure to provide the appropriate information. Note: there are rules about sending books to prisons. So don't.~~

IN-PERSON DEAL:  (Warehouse hours: Mon - Sat 10am - 9pm
	This one works on the honor system. If you can share Carrie's story with someone who hasn't heard it yet, I could put all that fine print stuff, about one per person per day per solar eclipse blah blah blah, but just be a cool person. Its way easier, since Carrie will just say no if you aren't) When checking out, just say you are from the internet. No, really.

NOTES:  
	I have never done this before. If it looks like it was slammed together, I will get back to you. Give me some time though. Please, though, message me again if you don't hear from me in a week. If you fall through the cracks, I'm sorry and I will get to you.

**EDIT**: Carrie and crew are already seeing a ton of orders! I think reddit is going to break things, but be kind, I haven't been this in-demand ever.

**EDIT2**: I apologize for the weight limits being enacted. These are really high numbers (most bags are 1/2 to 3/4 that) but there are extra heavy books out there that are throwing off the numbers. These prices are somewhere between losing money and beating out pulping

~~**EDIT3**: International shipping is here! You select the categories

Here's my list:

* Robert Jordan's (RIP) Wheel of Time.  Really just an epic series coming in at 14 books.  The final novel is set to be released in January.  It got me over my fantasy prejudice.  The first book borrows heavily from Lord of the Rings and the author acknowledged this, Crossroads of Twilight, is pretty slow.  But the series is too good for a single mediocre book to drag it down.  I highly suggest it.  Give it a shot.  Mat Calhoun becomes the best character after being kinda a dick.

* A Song of Ice and Fire.  I don't think that this one really requires an explanation.  Another great fantasy world.  Martin really drags you in with Game of Thrones before putting in any of the weirder

* Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe series.  There are 11 original books that take Sharpe through the Spanish Peninsula all the way to Waterloo during the Napoleonic Wars as he fights under Wellington.  Sharpe is a commoner who was jumped up from the ranks and commands a groups of riflemen- skirmishers.  Sharpe is a badass character that is just a ton of fun to read.  Cornwell writes great stories and he does a fantastic job at describing the battles in a way that makes them come alive and also very easy to follow.  The series was popular enough to warrant Cornwell writing 3 prequels of him in India and now there are 24 total Sharpe books.  I recommend to everyone

* Bernard Cornwell's Saxon Stories.  Uthred is an Anglo (ok, talks down to the priests (except one or two), creates controversy, and is another badass motherfucker whose exploits are just a ton of fun to follow.

* Conn Iggulden's Conqueror series.  Follows Genghis Khan from childhood, but it picks right up again.  Based heavily on The Secret History of the Mongols.  His Emperor series will be 5 books when the next one comes out, but it's just too fictionalized and untrue to the historical record for my taste.

* Colleen McCullough's Master of Rome Series.  Probably the best historical fiction out there in terms of scholarship

* Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey–Maturin series (AKA Master and Commander).  Probably the golden standard of historical fiction.  If you're interested in the British Navy during the time period

* Simon Scarrow's Eagle series.  Follows a Roman centurion and his optio (think sergeant).  Cato is upjumped as a favor for his father and has to prove himself whereas Macro is a grizzled veteran.  They have enemies within the officer corps of the Roman elite who strive to undermine them.  Two really cool characters that interact well.  The first books start in Britain

* Vince Flynn's Mitch Rapp series.  Kind of a guilty pleasure of mine.  Rapp is a CIA agent who does the whole counter-terrorism deal.  Lots of stereotypes.  He's a badass.  He hates the red tape and regulations that hold him back from achieving his goals.  All that good stuff.  But the stories are good

* King's The Dark Tower- 8 books

I know I'm forgetting a couple so I'll post some more later.  Would like to see what /r/books likes in terms of series and maybe find a new one for when I finish rereading Wheel of Time.

I checked the wikipedia

2. [*The Demolished Man*](http://www.amazon.com/DEMOLISHED-MAN-Alfred-Bester/dp/B00446J08E/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327050274&amp;sr=1-1) by Alfred Bester - In a future ruled by enlightened telepaths who prevent crime by knowing about it before it occurs

3. [*Hunger*](http://www.amazon.com/Hunger-Novel-Knut-Hamsun/dp/0374531102/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327051820&amp;sr=1-1) by Knut Hamsun - This is the story of a man who is losing his mind from starvation. It's a story of a man with too much pride. Honestly, but was glad when it was finally over as well.

4. [*Angels*](http://www.amazon.com/Angels-Novel-Denis-Johnson/dp/0060988827/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327051923&amp;sr=1-4) by Denis Johnson - After reading [*Seek*](http://www.amazon.com/Seek-Reports-Edges-America-Beyond/dp/0060930470/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327051923&amp;sr=1-6), *Angels*. Quite a few years ago I was having a discussion with a friend about the role each person has in their own life. I was on the side that people are often nothing more than captives of their own circumstances, while my friend took a much more Sartrean approach saying that each person wills their own life, thus is responsible for everything that comes out of it. This discussion is one of the major themes of this book. How much of a role do we have in our own lives, and how much of where we are is due to our circumstances? Denis Johnson is probably the best American writer alive -- sad he doesn't get more recognition.

[*Pigtopia*](http://www.amazon.com/Pigtopia-Kitty-Fitzgerald/dp/B002SB8OPM/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327058828&amp;sr=1-1) by Kitty Fitzgerald - I really enjoyed Katherine Dunn's [*Geek Love*](http://www.amazon.com/Geek-Love-Novel-Katherine-Dunn/dp/0375713344/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327052481&amp;sr=8-1), but that's exactly what happened. In the same vein as Dunn's book, *Pigtopia* is certainly filled with gore and macabre. However, as shocking as this book may be, it is also filled with beauty. It's the story of a disfigured, abused, and abandoned idiot who has created his own world (a la Pan's Labyrinth) to escape his reality. Someone comes along and pulls him from his world to help him face the real world. This is an awesome story of rejection and love. I don't want to give too much away

6. [*Second Hand Smoke*](http://www.amazon.com/Second-Hand-Smoke-Thane-Rosenbaum/dp/0312254180/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327058844&amp;sr=1-1) by Thane Rosenbaum - Honestly, and I'm really glad I gave it a chance. Unlike many Holocaust books, this one doesn't actually deal with the concentration camps directly. Rather, this is a book set in Miami, following a card shark who lives by the wits she used to survive the Holocaust. More than that, this is the story of her family, and how her experience impacts those who did not experience it. Now maybe the title packs more of a hit?

7. [*Meditations in Green*](http://www.amazon.com/Meditations-Green-Stephen-Wright/dp/0375712933/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327058867&amp;sr=1-1) by Stephen Wright - This was one of the best war novels I've read. It's the story of the Vietnam war, thinking the war may be a bit of fun, and something he can certainly get through unharmed. We watch as the man decays from an intelligent and strong person into a heroin addict trying to turn himself into a plant form. The amazing aspect of this book is how Wright is able to relate the Vietnam war to the absurdities in our lives in the real world. James Griffin (the protagonist) hasn't really left what is wrong with the world back in Vietnam. This isn't going to be very popular around here, but I enjoyed this book more than I enjoyed *Catch-22*, and Wright certainly deserves far more recognition than Heller received, but alas that's not how history unfolded.

8. [*Kitchen*](http://www.amazon.com/Kitchen-Banana-Yoshimoto/dp/0671880187/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327053858&amp;sr=1-1) by Banana Yoshimoto - This is actually two short stories, kitchens and love. The biggest focus here is going on with one's own life after the loss of a loved one. I really enjoyed both stories, and thought they dealt with the subject matter beautifully.

9. [*In the Dutch Mountains*](http://www.amazon.com/Dutch-Mountains-Harvest-Translation/dp/015600402X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327054081&amp;sr=1-1) by Cees Nooteboom - I really enjoy the creativity of Cees Nooteboom. I've yet to read anything by him that I did not enjoy. This story starts in a classroom, who are forced to leave their safe home and travel to a place in ruins. Kai is abducted by the Snow Queen's sorcerer, leaving Lucia -- with the aid of a clown -- to save him. This is a great book for kids, but even adults will enjoy entering the imaginative and incredible worlds Cees Nooteboom builds.

10. [*Caucasia*](http://www.amazon.com/Caucasia-Novel-Danzy-Senna/dp/1573227161/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327054400&amp;sr=1-1) by Danzy Senna - Being biracial myself (Mexican/White),,False,self,t5_2qh4i,True,,True

1)  **Purpose**  We will develop a guiding statement for /r/Books going forward.  Something to help new members understand what the subreddit is about and to help moderators keep things in line.

&gt;This community is focused on discussing books, or everything else book related.

The current statement might cover it for us without any changes.  Discussion of books

2)  **Rules - What /r/Books Encourages and Removes**  

These are my *draft* points of view that can be accepted

* I will personally push for **no memes**.  None at all.  Point here is that memes become the antithesis of book *discussion*
* We will work to encourage posting of book-related news and questions that spur book-related discussions.  
* Book recommendations are a constant request.  Potential to have a process in place to highlight recommendation questions.
* Bookporn should probably be eliminated.  ""Look at what I own"" pictures rarely add value and there are subreddits like /r/bookshelf for bookish photo shoots.  
* Blogspamming is an issue today and will only become more of an issue. We will continue to ban spammers quickly.
* AMAs will continue to become part of the agenda.  The nature of /r/Books is that these will need to be more recognized authors plus industry people.

Point in all of this is to add an element of focus to /r/Books as the subreddit grows.  We all have seen subreddits degrade due to volume and lack of purpose.

We will also be putting out an official request for help from new mods - please keep an eye out.
