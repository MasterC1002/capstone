I was ecstatic to hear that you were coming to my hometown of Phoenix for your show. I live in a suburb outside of the city and about 20 minutes from where you're going to be August 16. However


I've gone through high school and some college watching the PhilipDefranco show, and it became a daily habit to sit down and watch the episodes together. It suffices to say that I love the work you guys all do. Also, thanks for the common sense, the world needs it.


So, it would be great. Or play a round of Cards Against Humanity with you guys, it would make my year. Please let me know, I'm willing to really do whatever in order to see you before I leave. Also it would give me some bragging rights among my friends and possibly a reason to update my Google+ status. You guys and I both know it takes something big for someone to do that that isn't famous or marketing. 


Thanks

TL;DR: Asking to meet you guys sometime before the 16th because I can't make the show.

I am a board game hobbyist, and it made me realize how great it would be to see the SourceFed crew playing some of my favorite, lesser-known games. I typically play 2+ hour strategy games, but there are some fantastic party games that aren't readily found in big box stores and are barely known to most of the masses. The hobby board games market is going through a sort of a renaissance right now. Sales are booming, the internet is a-buzz, and board game Kickstarters are raising millions of dollars. Wil Wheaton's show Tabletop on Geek &amp; Sundry gets a lot of the credit for bringing hobby games to the mass market and the spotlight of public awareness.

tl;dr: play these games, make great content, get lots of views.

[**Ca$h n Gun$**](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/19237/cash-n-guns) (3-6 players, takes 8 ""bullet cards"", and a foam gun (yes! an actual foam pistol!). Through eight rounds players will be trying to off each other in a series of standoffs to split the spoils. Five stacks of cash are flipped over, players choose what their gun will be doing this round (bullet card) and plays it face-down (Click!, Bang!, or Bang Bang Bang!), someone counts down from three, anyone feeling the pressure has a chance to back down

*Why SourceFed needs to play this game:* Ca$h n Gun$ is tense. It has this ""moment"" that no other game I'm aware of has. As soon as players aim their guns there is a brief moment where everyone looks around the table to see who's shooting who

[**King of Tokyo**](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/70323/king-of-tokyo) (2-6 players, destroy each other, heal, and generate energy to buy special abilities. When in Tokyo, a player can smash everyone else into dust, but are also the target of all other players. The last monster standing or the first person with 20 victory points wins.

*Why SourceFed needs to play this game:* King of Tokyo is chaotic. On one turn you can be on top of the world, retreating to the Pacific Ocean to lick your wounds. Also, there's a dinosaur character for Lee. And a bunny in a huge robot suit.

[**Love Letter**](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/129622/love-letter) (2-4 players, a player draws a second card, and then plays a card in front of them. Each card is very simple, yet they all hold a lot of strategic depth and can provide a lot of interaction. Players will be using their card to either knock the other players out, or be the player with the highest ranking member of the court when the deck runs out.

*Why SourceFed needs to play this game:* Love Letter sets the scene for a lot of deceptive cardplay and even character acting. Every round has that ""ah-ha"" moment when you realize that the guy next to you is holding the King card

[**Pit**](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/140/pit) (3-8 players, you can trade cards with them. When a player manages to trade for all nine cards of a given type, he rings a bell (included with the game), announces that he has cornered the market, and then scores points.

*Why SourceFed needs to play this game:* Pit is loud, and a classic. Trades are made in real time, so everyone will constantly try to be heard over each other. ""One, one, one."" ""Three, three, three cards."" ""Two

[**The Resistance**](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/41114/the-resistance) (5-10 players, corporate spies are hidden amongst you. Players are secretly given roles of either Resistance (good guys) or Spies (bad guys). Over the course of five rounds, strike teams are formed, voted on, and sent out. But will the Resistance's mission succeed? Or be sabotaged by a Spy? Weed out who the spies are and keep them out of missions, or convince everyone that some other guy is the spy and doom the Resistance to failure.

*Why SourceFed needs to play this game:* Deception. The Resistance is all about deception and politics. Every move you make will rouse suspicion amongst fellow players


Five fantastic games that I feel would go over great with the SourceFed hosts, or can be played to less points. Pit can be found pretty easily at Barnes &amp; Noble. The other four games can only be found at specialty shops or online, all fairly cheaply. (Amazon, CoolStuffInc, Ebay) The exception to this is Ca$h n Gun$, which is currently out of print and pretty hard to get hold of. I would be more than happy to help out in any way with getting these games into the hands of the SF hosts and even teaching the games in some way so that you guys won't have to slave over rulebooks.

Even if this doesn't pan out, and are continuing to at a rapid pace.


Thanks for reading this. Keep up the great work

Firstly, and really established yourself as a alternative outlet for news coverage.

I've been watching for about a year (my first video was 'Community is Back'). In that year Sourcefed has evolved and mostly for the better. However

You have stopped 20 minutes or less of News Coverage. And I mean actual news. Having 2/5 stories about video game releases isn't news.

Yesterday

My last bone to pick is with 'Five on Friday'. If the viewers wanted viral videos they wouldn't be subscribed to Sourcefed.  

I know it's a huge think to ask

**Why I made it**

Due to an injury I found myself with way too much time to kill that I then figured I'd use to make a portfolio piece in the form of a Java game. This game turned into the SourceFight prototype
  

**First contact**

Since I rather liked how the initial demo turned out I decided to ask for the team's permission to use their likenesses, Trisha: thanks again!!), but I haven't heard anything from him since. If Phil's anything like me chances are he just completely forgot about it. That, or he thinks I'm some sort of spambot by now and blocked me everywhere... Either or, really. =P
  

**Moving forward**

Basically this is my last-ditch effort to revive this project. I would absolutely  *love* to keep working on this game, and hopefully provide a response.
  

**Links**

* Video: http://patrickboelens.com/sites/default/files/sourcefight/Pitch.mov
* Playable demo (cross-platform): http://patrickboelens.com/sites/default/files/sourcefight/SourceFight.zip

I hope you guys like it and will help me get Phil and co. to see it. If not... Just don't downvote me to oblivion please. =P

So how about we do this. Every day at around noon EST someone post a table talk for that day titled ""Table Talk for (Insert day and date here)"" That way i think it will be easier than having a hundred posts flooding the page. That way the SF crew can just click that single link and just scroll down and see the ones we upvote from there. 

Hows that sound? 

Edit1: Lets try and get it upvoted so others can see this. In not really looking for karma
 
Edit2: Maybe instead of doing it one for every day

Edit3: It looks like someone already had the idea before i did. [Here is the thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/SourceFed/comments/1c4hb7/table_talk_thread_41113/)

Edit4: I am willing to help moderate the page when it comes time to submit questions. For now I'll post the table talk Thread and You guys can add your questions freely. Ill Post Basic rules for us to follow on there as well.

I feel there is quite a stigma in the last couple of years with people finding out about new things they like

Because a lot of nerd culture is now becoming more mainstream with popular comics becoming films such as Avengers,  I do see this kinda resentment towards new fans, and it's crazy. 

People who have been fans a long time should be welcoming new people to the mix and showing them what an awesome community there is, if Joss would of had as bigger following as he does now because of new fans, Angel would of got a season six. Firefly would of got many more seasons, and Buffy would of easily got an animated show that Joss made a pilot for, but it got turned down. 

To summarise, Comic Con has changed. It's not the die hard comic book convention it once was, but that's okay. Why are some trying to hinder the growth of amazing talent because they want to hold on to how things were in the past. I got into comic books because I started reading Buffy Season 8 and it sparked a new found love for comics and I branched out into loads of other franchises because of television.

1371861815.0,1gtwe6,An Open Discussion Thread: My Thoughts On R/SourceFed,CeeEsTee,32,15,39,"**Preface**

This is a long text post detailing my personal thoughts on how this subreddit relates to SourceFed as a Youtube Channel. Wall of text ahead



Several people have pointed out that the content here on /r/sourcefed leaves something to be desired, the mods, and DeFranco Inc. 

Please respond to me with your detailed opinions

**Current Content**

**N**ow let's get the obvious out of the way. All of the SourceFed hosts are quite attractive, complaints about the quality of the content, or other crude remarks. I understand that most of this audience sees this as innocuous fun, and that that is the content that is easily made and upvoted, but I still believe we should strive for a higher ideal.

**I** propose we create either a tagging system to sort the posts

**N**ot everyone appreciates Trisha solely for her boobs

**O**bviously this is a fine line we will have to walk

**Future Content**

**I** also have some questions for the moderators of /r/sourcefed. How active do you consider yourselves to be on the subreddit? It is only occasionally that you create a legitimate thread for the Table Talk discussion posts, as not very many Defranco Inc. Employees seem to be involved in the subreddit, but I still feel a better job could be done on a day-to-day basis.

**I** don't expect overnight change

**A**lso

**Summary**

**I** enjoy both SourceFed and Phil's videos very much, while other potentially great posts fade into the black. 

**W**hat are *your* thoughts /r/sourcefed? Am I way off base? Let me know what you think. 

**I** want this to be an open dialogue so I can contribute to the community in a way that will please everyone.

**TL;DR**: I care about /r/sourcefed. Just go read the post when you have time.

-
Best to worst methods for cleaning overall:
1. Bidet
-
2. Wet toilet paper (In order for friction to not cause paper to fall apart when wet
-
3. Baby wipes / Moist cloth
-
4. Dry toilet paper
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pros/cons of each:

Bidet - Cleans very effectively and thoroughly no need for TP / Wastes water

~

Wet toilet paper - Cleaned just as effective if not slightly better as Bidet and baby wipes

~

Baby wipes - Cleaned as effective as wet toilet paper, Costly

~

Dry toilet paper - None / Worst performer of testing group, fecal matter can bleed through sheets contaminating hands 

~

Basically if you need to wipe, bidets are best, baby wipes are meh.

~

Results were achieved through a combination of surveys (Comfort

My name is Magicmanx3 and I have been a fan of SourceFed since its first interation as 20 minutes of less and every iteration thereafter. I along with /u/iamacannibal were chosen by you guys as community moderators for this sub which we are forever grateful. /u/Kixwiz, and myself are all working to make this a more active community with more interaction with the Defranco Inc team. As such 


As you have probably noticed this entire subreddit has gone through some significant changes over the past 4 days. We have moved through all of the backlog of posts and changed formatting on the page. (Well mostly /u/iamacannibal has done the changes since he has taught himself CSS like a boss). Some changes were liked some changes were disliked (cough downvote cough cough). And still other changes are in the works.


As all of this is being done for the community as a whole, leave a comment down below and tell us what you think.

My question though is how should I memorialize the couch? Should I hang it up on a wall somewhere? Should I have a plaque or a sign with it? What should that sign or plaque say? Any ideas or help would be much appreciated.

For the uber nerdy people here are some I find amazing. 

* [Nerd Poker](http://www.earwolf.com/show/nerd-poker/)- Comedian Brian Posehn and friends go and play D&amp;D together and record it. Some of the most fun I have listened to and really makes me want to start a game.

* [Cast of Thrones](http://castofthrones.com/)- A podcast for all of you GoT fans that follows each season episode by episode unpacking all of the mounds of information into easily consumed chunks. 

* [Talking Toons](http://robpaulsenlive.com/category/podcasts/)- A podcast where Rob Paulsen (Voice of Wacko Warner

* [Stuff You Should Know](http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/) A great listen about random things you think about but never really look up. 

For those looking for those celebrities you want to learn more about..

* [The Nerdist](http://www.nerdist.com/podcast/nerdist/)- This has been around for a few years now and the backlog is a whose who of hollywood and television. I believe he has interviewed most of the new generation Doctors so take a listen.

* [WTF with Marc Maron](http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast)- The granddaddy of them all Marc Maron has sat down and interviewed almost every comedian you have ever heard of and then some. I highly reccomend listening to the Louis C.K. episode. 

* [Girl on Guy](http://girlonguy.net/)- Hosted by Aisha Tyler (Voice of Lana from Archer

Straight up comedy podcasts

* [Improv4Humans](http://www.earwolf.com/show/improv4humans/)- Very funny Show with MAtt Besser from the UCB. Multiple improv sketches per show that I find hysterical.

* [Comedy Bang Bang](http://www.earwolf.com/show/comedy-bang-bang/)- A fun interview based show that always gets interrupted by improv characters. Paul F Thompkins is a regular and this is freaking hysterical

* [Doug Loves Movies](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/doug-loves-movies/id281816774)- Though he did diss Ross many years ago I still love this podcast. Essentially a name that tune game show but with movies. He has on comedians and actors alike and all in all a really fun show that is a quick hour.

* [ SModcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/smodcast-smodcast/id215010467)- A Podcast that has been going on for almost 5 years now


Ok that is it for now. Please let me know if you have any others you listen too that I could get into. I love finding new laughs and I always want to share the ones I listen to. I hope you enjoy these ones.

Oh and btw for all those requesting a PhillyD podcast

17 days ago a garment factory collapsed on its workers in Bangladesh. There was a huge controversy because the managers made the people come to work even though they were told they shouldn't because of a wall collapse the day before. After the collapse the main owner fled but was later caught trying to leave the country. At this point the death count is above 1000 and they are still searching. But yesterday they found a lady who had been under the ruble for 17 days. She was stuck in a mosque under the building. She had some food and room to move around and luckily survived until workers saw a moving rod and saved her. Though she is physically fine she is going thru some major PTSD. Also all of these people were very poor and most were young. Please cover this story because very few people outside the south-Asian communities know about it. Here's a link to an article that talks about it. You can also just Google Bangladesh Building Collapse and find lots of info. Thanks.

*  The original Resident Evil series for the playstation 


* Final Fantasy all of them. This series makes you fall in love with so many different characters and truly takes you on a journey.


*  Mass Effect this is one of the greatest stories ever told.


*  The Walking Dead not the crappy hicktown fps. This is a game that makes every decision feel like the weight of the world is behind it. There are intense moments as well as tear jerking hit you right in the feels moments. Classic.


*  Gears of War you play as a marine fighting a losing battle against an enemy that seems to have no end or weakness. Loved the story telling and atmosphere of the game.


* Metal Gear Solid Solid Snake nuff said.


* Kotor I spent hundreds of hours playing this game growing up. The voice over and dialog options and story telling are so immersive its still to this day an amazing game.


* Red Dead Redemption this game is one of rockstars best games in my opinion. I felt connected to the main character. The way they captured how living in wild west and during that time is the best to date. 


* Bioshock this series is regarded by many to be the best story ever told by a video game. I think it's a great story and a great series of games. 


* Deadlight this is a game many of you might not be familiar with. It's a very atmospheric side scrolling zombie apocalypse game. The mood set in this game is top notch and it feels like you are in a graphic novel. It's one of my favorite games.

New lance cat affects gamers
- At least 3 000 Kronor per country in new tax
Published June 26
NEW TAX. Just days after a Swedish court announced that the computers will be subject to a special computer tax to finance public broadcasting received yet another shock. ""LAN play requires a permit
The organizer of the so-called country will now be required to pay a fee of up to 35
The decision is a result of the new law of the Supreme Administrative Court received since Reinfeldt government revised slot regulation last year.
Also video games under the new authorization.
- In the eyes of the law, general counsel at the Gaming Board, the gadget and computer magazine M3.
According to Johan Röhr, Internet cafes, where computers are mainly for other than gaming.
In addition to tax may apply an inspection of the Gaming Board is to make supervision during a lanparty.
The new lance cat gets criticized by Erik de Basso
- They equate our business to go and playing Donkey Kong at the pub. It's clear they get pissed
Gaming Board now invites all companies and economic associations which organize games on computers in lanenvirement or the Internet to seek authorization from the Authority. For purely private lanpartys needed so far no permission. A permit is valid for two years.

Based on the game FIFA (Football/Soccer)

You could work these types of rules around any multiplayer competitive game that is based on score

So

If you lose by said amount you do the forfeit! 
i.e. You lose 5 - 0

And it is if you lose by 5


These are the official and ORIGINAL rules for FIFA!

First rule of FIFA

Lose by the following and face up to the forfeit;

5 - Write a Facebook apology to your opponent praising them for their brilliance.

6 - You must kiss the feet of your opponent.

7 - You must make your opponent a tasty sandwich.

8 - You must be the slave of your opponent for an hour.

9 - You must eat a tablespoon of various kitchen ingredients of your opponent's discretion.

10 - You must send a Moonpig apology to your opponent

11 - Winning player gets 11 minutes on the losers Facebook to do whatever they wish (No changing passwords). Whatever is put on there has to stay for at least 11 days.

12 - You must play the next game fully naked

13 - You have to go to your next door neighbours and start describing the game in its full detail, if they shut the door move on to the next house and pick up where you left off. 

14 - The person must wear a custom t-shirt, "" I lost by 14 on Fifa 11 "" on the front, it can have what ever the winner desires. The loser must then walk around town explaining to 14 different people why they have lost so badly and get them to sign the t-shirt. A picture must then be uploaded to facebook with the T-shirt on for further abuse. 

15 - You must send a letter to FIFA explaining in great detail why you lost by 15 goals.

20 - You are not allowed to play FIFA, EVER again.

_____________
Player Rules
_____________

Score a hat trick with Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink against someone else and they must refer to you as *your name* of *your town of choice* for a fortnight.

Score a hat trick with Park Ji Sung and your opponent has to run everywhere he goes

Score a hat trick with Andy Carroll/Neymar and your opponent must go into a shop and pay more for an item than it is worth.

Score a header with Aaron Lennon and your opponent must shave his eyebrows

Score a hat trick with Dimitar Berbatov

Score a hat trick with Eric Abidal and your opponent must donate a minimum of £5 to a cancer charity and 
say why they are doing it. Why not help at the same time as embarrassing them?

Get a man sent off while playing as Arsenal and you must play the remainder of the match blindfolded. If Wenger did not see the incident

Lose against Accrington Stanley with any top tier team

13. Ride a bicycle.
14. Defend a woman's honor.
15. Know basic first aid. 
16. Have a set of tools and know the difference between a standard and philipshead screwdriver.

These are just the basics. If you really want to impress...
1. Learn to play an instrument .
2. Know how to change a diaper
3. Know how to give a decent 10 minute massage.
4. Be able to cook one full meal.
5. Remember to put the toilet seat down without being asked. 
6. Anticipate a friend's or significant other's needs and take the initiative to meet them.
