Hello everyone. I am TheLovePirate, and am very excited to be a part of the fantastic moderator team we have here.    
      
I thought it would be a good idea if we could all have a little powwow together about this subreddit
     
First off
     
We personally are tired of seeing clips from T&amp;E Awesome Show episodes, it isn't our decision, it's yours. If you guys want this to be, more or less, as is that's fine, or you could let us try some things out around here to see if we can really make this place the bee's knees.

my child.

Each morning I awake because of your smile.

You are my oldest stepson

and your cheshire smile breathes gold on the steppes of time.

Think not of yourself you do

but of others who aren't as fine.

Thou hast made great the day

and thou shall miss ye upon the first light of morn --

The ships from sea come sailing in

the bells go 'dong' and then again.

The grass grows tall

as the love for my son

the will of my heart.

You pirates of old time

you vagabonds of dust.

Ponder your hearts

until at last at one.

And the spirit of my heart shall never rest.

The bells go 'ding dong

ding dong

ding dong.'
