1364362250.0,1b3g4a,A Raider Fan's Assessment of DHB,,72,5,11,"Hi Lions fans

x-posted from /r/nfl.


*  Great person, hard worker, and has improved dramatically every season, except perhaps 2012 when the entire offense slipped backwards with Greg Knapp as the OC.  

*  Tough.  He can get the stuffing knocked out of him and then stick his head right back into the mix as if nothing happened.  Eg.

* Very good-to-great edge run blocker which goes with his physicality

*  Above average route running.  He was miserable as a route runner when he first came into the league and now (2012) he is doing some really good things.  He's no Isaac Bruce

*  Very VERY good RAC WR.  Strength, he breaks tackles and then explodes upfield outracing DBs to the endzone.  

*  Can make impressive, DHB HAS ARRIVED!""  

* Still inconsistent with basic catches.  Can drop passes at critical times--like a 5 yard square out on 3rd-and-3--that make you think

*  Rarely seems very natural catching the ball and often seems to be fighting the ball  (""The ball is my friend."").  In traffic, he won't, even if the defender never even touches the ball, but just distracts him enough.

*  Will sometimes make some elementary mental mistakes that leave you scratching your head

* CAN hand-catch, ideally with the ball hitting him square in the numbers.  This leads him to try to align his body with the ball most times.  This means that he sometimes jumps when he doesn't need to and also that his best, most consistent routes are ones that have him facing the QB  (Curls, digs, crossing, or settling in zones).

* Is improving at 9-routes and double-moves.  Since he now is effective running intermediate routes, in getting separation, and in tracking and catching the ball deep.  He seems comfortable catching nice ""rainbow"" passes (fades as well as go routes).


Comparable to Demaryius Thomas.   He is similar in many ways to pre-emergent Thomas, what will make him interesting is that he does have this type of POTENTIAL.  And if he's in a conducive system that plays to his strengths--more like the 2011 Raiders--he could be a surprisingly good player.  Even if he never emerges into a true stud, he can make enough some big plays to make you cheer for him.

In other ways

He's a good man and has worked hard and given his all.  I'm sure he will continue to do so and is a good person to have on a team.  If he were a 2nd or 3rd round pick

Having said all that, ""Prove it""-type deal.

Judge for yourself.

I was taken less seriously back then because we were winning games. Now hopefully people will listen.

1. Stop running draws on 1st down: They don't work, let alone a team without a running game. If you want to run the ball, use 2TE sets and audible into something for Shef if you don't feel good about the run. This playcalling is bad and the playcaller should feel bad.

2. PUT AN END TO THE WIDE 9 DEFENSIVE LINE: It's awful. It's just awful. For those of you who don't know

3. Stop being so god damn aggressive on special teams coverage: It's gotten out of hand. The ST coach is telling players to over-run their gaps to try to hit the returner for 2 or 3 yards less then they would if they stayed on their gaps. It's ridiculous. You risk a big return and the only reward you get is 2 or 3 yards back for the other team's offense. 

4. STAFFORD WINDOWS

5. Empty backfield: As someone who actually has an X and O's football IQ, he options out into the flat for a dump-off. Stop, the, empty, back, field.

6. THE SHEF. USE HIM: He is basically a slower, but so far, he's been a non-factor, and that's wrong.

7. Jim, he's trying to force mediocore RBs into LOOKING like good RBs by running the ball too much. Don't come at me with a pass/run ratio from this past game, because the lions were on pass on every down mode right to the end. It's the run/pass ratio that PUTS us into a pass on every down scenario that needs to be noted. You have one of the better QBs in the league and the best WR in the league. You don't put it in these rookies two out of 3 downs. Stop.

Summary: It's the play calling. It's not Stafford, regularly, until we're on 3rd and long and the defense KNOWS we're going to pass. That's the beauty of Stafford, everybody knows he's gonna throw, and he still completes the pass for a 1st down. We're given chance after chance thanks to him.

This game is still essentially a fluke, not the special teams.",,False,self,t5_2rynx,False,lions1,

edit: I'd also like to add that I think it's fair to attribute a fair amount of blame for this loss to the play calling. Consider our last drive. 3rd &amp; 5 around the 50.

 Obviously I'm new so don't really know much of the franchise

From what I know Stafford

 Barry Sanders is our greatest ever player. Someone put a curse on us in '58 (50 years later we went 0-16) and we play at Ford Field. 

From what I've been told this is one of the best times to start supporting the Lions so that's good. From what I've read supporting The Lions is like supporting my soccer team (Leeds United). A great fanbase but the team doesn't perform to the standards expected and we've been rubbish for ages.

I'm in The UK so won't get to see that many games but will try to watch as many as possible.

It's likely we will win 1 or 2 more games this season.

That puts us at 9-7 or 10-6.

The Falcons are in pretty good shape in terms of grabbing the 5th seed after an impressive comeback against the Panthers. I would be surprised if they didn't win at least two more games

The Bears OT loss after a game of bad luck did a lot for us. They certainly aren't out of the race but will need to win at least 2 more games to have a real chance. They will have to hope that we lose more than just 1 game. This is all assuming that both teams lose to the Packers

As far as NFC East

In terms of playoff berths, are tied for overall record with the 49ers and although they are losing the tiebreakers right now, it wouldn't be surprising to see the Saints finish with a better record and get the 2nd seed meaning that we would face the 49ers in the first round. I'm not sure which one I prefer, but I watched the Cardinals beat the 49ers tonight, so it's possible that we are seeing a downturn.

Suh plays hard whistle to whistle and I can appreciate that. The guy is already rich with a (60 million dollar contract) and has a great education (Engineering degree from Nebraska). The fact that this guy goes so hard every down and with reckless abandon is a great thing to watch because he is certainly not doing it to benefit himself. Instead of chastising him people should want more players to emulate him.
The stomp was bad but he has since learned from that. It was an emotional response to whatever was going on at the bottom of that pile. Give the guy a break and get over it. The guy takes intimidation and domination to the next level and he was virtually unblockable during that Texans game.

We need to relax.

Remember where we were 4 years ago. Totally devoid of talent. Look where we are now. On the verge of competitive in the best division in the league.

Did we take a big step forward this year? Well... Yes and no.

Let's be honest about last year. How many games did we barely win? And then there's the whole thing with the Bears completely collapsing after Cutler and Forte went out. We probably shouldn't have made the playoffs in the first place. We never beat a really good team and we never found consistency. Our players were highly emotional, but was majorly inconsistent and was often on the receiving end of some serious luck if you look at his adjusted INT ratios. We weren't ready to compete just yet.

Forgetting all the drama, but has proven to be pretty good, and a lot of work on not letting emotions dictate the game.

Unfortunately, and of course Calvin has been at various stages of not 100% all season. I said before the season that I thought the team who was most likely to win the division would be the team that stayed the healthiest. The Lions have not been that team by a long shot. It's affected all three phases as even our regular special teams players haven't been able to focus on their jobs while filling in elsewhere.

Luck has bitten us in other ways as well. We ruled turnover differential last year. We were 3rd in the league (I believe) in TOD, who are largely conservative and run oriented teams. Part of it is luck. We were lucky in that area last year, we haven't been this year. Take a look at the 49ers defense from last year to this year and the difference in turnovers created. It's huge, and they essentially have the exact same defense they had last year. You just can't count on TOD maintaining constant from year to year.

So, we had terrible timing for taking 3 high draft picks in a row with Johnson, Stafford, and Suh. Because they came in the limbo before the new rookie wage scale, we were forced to pay up the ass for them from the get go. Imagine the kind of trades we'd have been able to make if we weren't paying such a huge chunk of our salary cap to 3 players. That is a MAJOR disadvantage, and one that could take a few more years to overcome.

But I'm not trying to come off as completely pessimistic either. It's quite likely that ST will be a focus this offseason. Were it not for special teams issues, but in the last 3 games he's looked great. The kid is still young and obviously learning. We've got two young WRs who just need to find consistency. We finally have what looks like a running game. Not spectacular, but enough to provide balance. On defense, we have great players all over the field. They looked pretty damn good early in the year and with a little more luck with health and depth next year, they could easily be top 10 or better.

I'm not sure what the rush is

Edit: Also, they might be in trouble elsewhere. They will remain tough, but not invincible. The Vikings are having a fluke year. They are decent, but not 6-3 good. They will still struggle to finish 8-8 in my opinion. I'd attribute both of our losses to them largely to ST and field position.",,False,self,1352929519.0,t3_1376jg

* Kansas City is coming off of a big psychological blow in week 1 and will be desperate to redeem themselves.  This will lead to turnovers.

* Without Eric Berry the Chief's pass D is even weaker than it was last week when they gave up 4 pass TDs.  Stafford will exploit this for multiple pass TDs.

* Detroit's front 4 will stuff the Chief's run game and cause lots of 3-and-outs in the first half

First

Despite having only the 3rd most yards this season, Brady, Marino) to ever throw for more than 5000 yards.

Stafford finished the season with the 3rd highest passer rating for a QB under the age of 26. The other two were Marino with a rating of 108.9 at 23 and Culpepper with a rating of 98 at 23.

The only QB under the age of 24 with a higher completion percentage in a season was Marino in his record setting year.

A quick side note. The more I look through stats

Stafford threw for the 7th most TDs of any QB in history following Peyton, Rogers, and Marino (2 times).

Though the Giants outscored the Lions by 16 points in the 4th quarter of games this year, this is a stupid argument though as it over values comebacks. I would much rather see us get the lead and hold it more often.

I'm moving into a bit more subjective territory now.

That said, as seen by his completion percentage and that he had 10 games above a 100 passer rating. 

Consistency is constantly what people point to when they want to talk about how Stafford isn't a top QB yet. I won't necessarily disagree, take away Schaub) only Brees, Brady, Rogers, Romo, and Smith had better ratios. With 17 TDs and 5 interceptions, the data pool on Smith is too low to really compare him to the others. Anyway, 2.5625:1 is a damn consistent number. When you look at the other QBs this year, one good year is not enough to go on as far as whether or not a QB will be consistent

Of course people talk about Megatron. And the truth is, but after this year he is hands down #1. He had 561 more yards and 4 more TDs this year than last (also, 3 of his 12 TDs last year came in the one game that Stafford both started and finished).

Aside from boosting Megatrons stat line, and Scheffler, while giving Titus Young a very respectable 607 yard, 6 TD rookie season. It was the 7th most yards for a rookie receiver and the 4th most TDs. The guys above him are A.J. Green, Greg Little, and Doug Baldwin, who are primary receivers, Denarius Moore and Julio Jones

That's as much as I feel like digging up right now. Feel free to add to this with anything you can think of and be ready to plead the case for Stafford this offseason. Of course, we probably won't need to do much pleading.",,False,self,t5_2rynx,True,lions4,

What I do love is FANTASY football. I rarely ever watch the games and have never had a favorite team. I just liked breaking down the stats and working on predictions. It's pretty much a numbers game to me

So, Leshoure, and at different points in the season I also had Kevin Smith and Titus Young I thought, what the hell. My fate has been in these guys' hands so much maybe it will be fun to see it happen in front of me.

So, the longer these guys are on the field the better for me. If you saw it you know that these guys almost ran down the clock just fighting back and forth to get into field goal range. It was exciting as hell.

But, the more I wanted Detroit to win.

You have to understand, you know? But, I found myself cheering louder and louder every time they kept it alive, and being almost crushed when they lost (everybody in the world knew he was down, asshat refs).

So

The play calling on every side of the ball is horrible. It's predictable and does not adapt to the situation. We run the ball WAY too much. You know when the run actually works? When we get a successful pass attempt. 

They refuse to make any real changes to the schemes. Why is Logan our returner? Him fumbling is nothing new. Him being worthless in terms of return yards is nothing new. I always CRINGE when it's return time. You know why? Because he drops the ball SO MUCH! I only recall one

What has Schwartz even done? The only good thing he's done is bring in old Titan players like Tulloch.

You know the fumble by Bell at the goal line? WHY WAS HE EVEN IN THE GAME? They did it AGAIN. They put in Bell in the redzone and do not use LeShoure. LeShoure was suppose to be our GOAL LINE RB. They did this exact thing against the Titans. LeShoure didn't see one snap in the final redzone drive.

Look at the defense. Even the announcers said we blitz like idiots. Our LBs are not blitzing LBs. They are coverage LBs. The guys who get the tackles. The lineman are actually doing their job. What they did last night is nothing knew. We have more TDs on offense

We've played against some of the TOP RBs in the game.

SJax, AP, Vick, McCoy, Forte.

SJax: Combined 70 yards

Gore: Combined 105

CJ2K: Combined 19

AP: Combined 122

Vick: 59 Rushing.

McCoy: Combined 48

Forte: Combined 100

These are THE TOP RBs in the game and it's not stopping yet. We have to play Lynch next week, Foster, Turner, and Forte again this season. Only one time did a RB get over 102 yards rushing and it was AP. They're only getting these high numbers, because teams were wanting to run the ball and kill time. Even then, these numbers are nothing. These guys are capable of straight killing teams. The fact we stopped Forte from being a factor in the passing game is why it was so close. I had no doubt he'd be taken out of the game. I even benched him and started Marshall.

So defense isn't an issue really. Yeah

So what we had fumbles. Yea

This team is not a team that uses the run to setup the pass. HOW LONG DO THEY NEED TO REALIZE THIS? Setup the run with the pass and THEN run. Our best runs last night were RIGHT after a decent yardage pass. 

DONT FUCKING RUN LESHOURE UP THE MIDDLE ON FIRST AND TEN FOR NO REASON! They do goal line rushes for some ungodly reason. LeShoure was stopped horribly multiple times on these rushes.

The fact we had so many turnovers that were costly

Right now

I've seen a lot of talk about the Lion's first round pick, and the T that was drafted in the 7th was arrested recently).

The Lions also may run into some cap issues this year as they are projected to be close to the cap with only 37 players under contract. I realize that re-signing Calvin could free up as much as 8M, and either re-sign or replace their starting CB and LT, and neither of those positions are cheap.

In Kiper's last draft I saw that he chose Janoris Jenkins as a possible pick for the Lions. I can agree that CB is a position of need

So who do I see the Lions going with? I think that Mike Adams (OT out of OH ST) would be a solid pick that would realistically be available at 23. He is a solid prospect and as ready to start in the NFL as any OT in the draft (short of Kalil). 

If he isn't there, nothing is more important than being able to get at the QB. The Giants did just win a SB with this formula... 

Another direction they could go is Peter Konz (C from Wis). Centers aren't generally taken in the first round

While I don't believe the Lions will move up in the draft

According to the [draft value chart](http://www.draftcountdown.com/features/Value-Chart.php), but more realistically the 15th spot.

1324474868.0,nl89r,Just how good will Stafford be?,sosuhme,24,0,29,"So... With Aaron Rogers looking like he may very well end up being the best QB of all time (I don't mean to get ahead of myself

Seeing as how Rogers spent his first three years on the bench and Stafford spent the first two years mostly injured

On 536 attempts Rogers completed 341 for a completion rate of 63.6%. After 14 games Stafford has a whopping 568 attempts and 356 completions for 62.7%. There's a couple things to look at here. First of all

Next up,145 and is averaging a slightly lower 7.3 ypc. When you look at that you can tell that the result of Staffords higher number of attempts is netting him more yards. Without doing as much research as I probably should on the subject, I'm going to guess that the 2008 Packers were not as relient on the pass game as we have been this year. Anyway, .2 ypc is not enough of a difference to warrant too much discussion.

In 2008, he is sitting at 33 TDs on the year as well. This is when I will get into Staffords finger injury. In the first eight games of the season, Stafford only had 4 interceptions to his 19 TDs, and in the last three games he has only had 1 interception to 7 TDs. That means in a three game span he racked up 9 interceptions to only 7 touchdowns. To me, that is a likely sign of him playing with an injured finger. If he hadn't returned to form as it healed, I might have been more willing to accept that it was mental issues or overall regression, but looking at the numbers shows a very clear trend to the contrary. Anyway, despite the injury

Sack numbers will likely be almost identical

The number that really caught my eye here was passer rating. Through 14 games Stafford has an identical passer rating to the one Rogers had in 2008

In fact, he has half as many fumbles, so I'll count that as a draw.

So how good will he be? I have no idea,False,self,t5_2rynx,False,,lions4,t3_nl89r

Current Playoff Picture

Bears

Cowboys are 7-5 and lead NFC East

Bears have @Denver, @Minn     
Without Cutler and probably Forte for all 4 games, and could also lose to Minn. IMHO they will go 2-2 or 1-3 to finish 8-8 or 9-7

Lions have Minn, @GB                         
Minn should be a win

Falcons have @Car, TB
Falcons should win at least two of the three against Car

Giants have @Dal, Dal.    
Dallas have NYG, NYG

Since they play each other twice, Giants finish 9-7, Cowboys finish 10-6). The Giants have lost 4 straight, and I would expect them to drop at least one if not both to the Cowboys, and probably another one to the Jets or the Redskins. IMHO the Cowboys win the NFC East and the Giants finish 8-8

Summary                                
Lions- 10-6 or 9-7
Falcons- 10-6 or 9-7
Bears- 9-7 or 8-8
Giants- 8-8

For tiebreaker if Lions, the Lions would most likely advance due to the record vs. common opponents. Lions are 1-1 vs. Uncommon opponents (SF and Dal). Chicago is 1-0(Philly) with Seattle left to play, and to get to 9-7 Chicago will likely need to beat Seattle, raising their Uncommon opponent record to 2-0. If this happens, then then Detroit advance with better record against common opponents.

TL;DR: Lions should still make the playoffs.

I've never been to Ford Field so hoping I can get some friendly advice for a visiting fan. What section do the visitors usually sit in? (I'll be bringing my 4 year old to his first game... so if there's a ""dawg pound"" equivalent for your team

I can't take this signing seriously

Bushrod allowed tons of pressures every week. The reason his sack total was so low was because Drew Brees released the ball so quickly. Bushrod's sack numbers will increase exponentially as he's trying to block for Jay Cutler. That means Cutler will likely miss multiple games due to injury yet again. The Bears would be better off with Webb manning the blind-side position again. I find it so ridiculous that an NFL front office would pay so much money to a pedestrian player.

1367105175.0,1d8qw8,Draft Recap,AUae13,26,4,14,"Now that the draft is over

We went in with no obvious starters at LT, DE, OLB, CB2, WR2, or KR, although we did have some pieces to play with, wide receiver

**Round 1: Ezekiel Ansah, but he has a very good chance of becoming an outstanding player. We now have 3 first round picks on the defensive line, which speaks to Schwartz's commitment to that position group.

**Round 2: Darius Slay, like Ansah, probably won't be ready to start week one. He has the measurables to become a serviceable starter though. This also tells us that the front office doesn't have the faith in the triad of corners taken last year as some of us fans do.

**Round 3: Larry Warford, it means that we trust Reiff to play on the outside, which means that Fox and Hilliard only have to hold one spot between them. Our Oline next year is pretty much established just by this pick.

**Round 4: Devin Taylor, but is more polished now. I expect him to strongly compete with Willie Young for a starting job until Ansah is ready.

**Round 5: Sam Martin, yes. But punters are very nearly fungible goods - they're easily replaced. We didn't upgrade *that* much by taking this pick. I'd rather have had an impact WR here or a backup DT or S. But, on the flip side, it was the bottom of the fifth round, and this is a guaranteed player. So there's that. 

**Round 6: Corey Fuller, and I don't think backup outside reciever was a big need. I would much more rather have taken a risk on Da'rick Rodgers or Marquess Wilson with this pick. Yes, they may have been Titus Young 2.0, but the talent was worth the character risk in the 6th. I doubt Fuller will make the team.

**Round 6: Theo Riddick, less as a running back. After thinking about it, I suspect he's a depth slot WR, hedging against Burleson or Broyles not being ready for the season. For that role, I don't dislike the pick. He may also be useful on special teams as a returner or gunner.

**Round 7: Michael Williams, we needed an H-back since Helelr is gone. Williams is a competent player, so there's that. Has a good shot of making the roster as a 3rd TE / Hback. Will never threaten to start at TE though, so don't confuse him for a replacement for Scheffler or Pettigrew as their contracts expire.

**Round 7, FAMU:** I'll be honest, I'd never heard of Hepburn. I guess he'll be a practice squadder who will try to make the special teams units. Obviously low expectations here, but we can hope.

Altogether, so we either trust Nagy (possible), or have a desperate need to address the future at safety next year. Other than those two spots, we did a decent job of getting high-potential players at spots of need, which is about all we could hope for from the draft.",,False,t5_2rynx,True

Ok we gave up a fifth round draft pick for this guy towards the end of last season for some reason but I have no idea why. 

I mean I get it was for depth or whatever because all of our WRs were dying by the end of the season so you would expect him to take snaps as WR2 right?

NOPE we put fucking Kris ""onecatchwonder"" Durham in front of him and he takes way more snaps in the last two games whan M80. Not to mention Thomas has a strong case of butterfingers.

Apparently he can return kicks or punts because supposedly he's really fast right?

NOPE fucking Stefan Logan still returns shit after the trade and continues to suck ass. Then when we finally bench him

Ok well we can use his speed for endarounds like we did with Burleson right?

NOPE not once. We never used him on a run play all season. 

Ok so to recap we gave up a fifth round pick for a WR who can't catch

He is essentially worthless to the team and a total waste of potential talent we could have drafted. I have no idea why we traded for him or why he's still on the roster now. Did we not know he sucked before trading for him?

After the loss at home today and I finally calmed down a bit; I started thinking about the importance of this game.  This game was fairly important if there was any outside shot of us making the playoffs this year

The Chiefs

We place so much importance on our teams and our players.  We hate the players that cost us games (looking at you Pettigrew) and idolize the ones that win us games (All Hail Megatron!).  The truth is that professional athletes are regular people with regular problems just like us.  They are not invincible.  

It's one thing to intellectually know that.  It's another thing entirely to *know* that.  

Imagine if you will that this had happened to one of our beloved Lions (no matter who it may have been).  I literally would be beside myself with grief.  Grief for people I have never met.  Not only would it be the first tears I've shed since my wedding day

I would imagine that many of you feel the same way I do about this team.  The truth is that for whatever reason, I love them all even in spite of their shortcomings. 

The loss this week and every other week may infuriate us.  It may cause us to have heart attacks and brain aneurysms.  This week may have flushed our playoff hopes down the drain this year.

I can think of more plays than I can count of my hands and feet that went very badly for us - namely Staff staring down Megatron, that stupid fucking bounce at the end (seriously, Hanson pulls out his 56 degree wedge, but also grabbed a ProV1? Shit stopped on a dime, totally whack)... but remember who was on the other side of the field. Literally the best team in the NFL. At home. In their time zone. Considering those circumstances alone, we did pretty well, I'd say.

Only 1 turnover, they're still probably the most efficient machine in the league right now and have the weapons to produce serious firepower if needed. Gore is a power back with moves on the side - the perfect combination (not an agile back with some power on the side, a phased out style of back that we unfortunately have in Smith/Best) - Vernon Davis has to be the best TE right now - hands, power, speed, composure - Moss, Crabtree, and Ginn make up an unfair plethora of targets for Alex Smith to choose from

And David Fucking Akers.

Don't even need to talk about the defense either.

So this is a great fucking team we played against. And our tackling was god fucking awful

All I'm saying is it's okay to lose to the San Francisco 49ers of 2012 on the road, still love our chances.

I guess I'm saying that because it doesn't feel right. ;_;

He was supposed to be the guy who got extra yards out of bad situations. And even though he was forced to carry the majority of the load this last year

I was re-watching the highlights just now and it seems like 1 of 2 things happened on every play. Either he was run out of bounds after getting a respectable gain

This got me thinking...What is your favorite/most memorable Lions game? Could be watched on TV/attended

I have a few:

* 1999 vs Washington - My family used to have season tickets for the Silverdome

* 2011 vs Chicago - The return of the Detroit Lions to MNF. I was lucky enough to be in attendance for that game and remember just what a great atmosphere it was. Two plays I remember well was the TD catch by Calvin and the 88 Yard run up the middle by Jahvid Best.

* 2011 Vs Dallas - Taking emotion out the the equation, what a game.

1: Win at home against Min and one of the next two games. Lose one of the next two games and lose at GB.

Final record: 9-7

Division record: 3-3
Conference record: 6-6

2: Win at home against Min and both of the following games. Lose at GB.

Final record: 10-6

Division record: 3-3

Conference record: 6-6

(It’s certainly possible that we could beat GB

Let’s explore our competition.

I’ll start with our division opponents

Thanks to their current situation on offense we may not have to fear them

Their schedule is easy enough that they could win as many as three games. If they end up going 10-6, that they will only win one or two more.

If they win their next two games

What I think is more likely though is for them to lose the next three weeks

Where things get tricky is if they lose to Denver, they would still hold a tiebreaker on conference wins and we would have to go 10-6 to beat them out. This is unfortunately likely.

Next up is Atlanta.

Obviously
The toughest two games for them will probably be at Carolina and at New Orleans. They get a bit of a freebie at home against Jacksonville

It is likely however that they will finish at either 9-7 or 10-6. If they finish 9-7

It is unlikely at this point that the Falcons won’t make the playoffs, were they also to finish 9-7.
Finally

It’s obviously a race between the Giants and Cowboys at this point. They have two remaining games against each other and we are actually rooting for the Cowboys to win both of them. It would essentially eliminate the Giants from the wildcard race.

That said
Lastly

The most likely path to the playoffs I foresee for us is a continued collapse by Chicago and a sixth seed berth due to losing the tiebreaker to Atlanta.

Some of it will hopefully be right though too. Anyway, but please say why you think I’m an idiot. That way I can tell you why you’re an idiot.

---

**Week 1 Vs. Minnesota:**

I love this matchup to start things off and get back on the right track. With our team healthy, our special teams failures were a huge factor in both games last year, but with a new coordinator and no Logan that should at least be partially improved.

---

**Week 2 @ Arizona:**

Another matchup I’m excited for. A chance to show that the worst game of our season last year was a fluke. The Cardinals might actually have a decent passing attack and Palmer will have better weapons at WR in Fitz, our secondary will probably still be healthy and Houston, Delmas, and Quin will be tough to move too much on and their O-Line will be exploited by Suh and Fairley. Their defense is tough, but not phenomenal. They don’t have anyone who can matchup with Johnson and are lacking in pass rush so I expect he’ll have a big day with a few deep catches.

---

**Week 3 @ Washington:**

Better to face the Redskins earlier rather than later right now. RG3 may not be back yet and even if he is, their lack of high end talent at WR will be exposed to our secondary. Their secondary was weak last year and they don’t have an elite pass rush. That spells a big game for Stafford to spread the ball around.

---

**Week 4 Vs. Chicago:**

The Bears are one of the toughest teams to predict this year. I was pretty harsh on them in my power rankings because so much is changing between the coaching staff and with Urlacher gone permanently. It’s also worth noting that they have several starters on defense above 30 and could easily face a slew of injuries as a result. On offense they added a decent TE, even if the Bears work on the short pass. However... If the coaching transition goes well, they could see some improvements on both sides of the ball and be a very tough team to contend with.

---

**Week 5 @ Green Bay:**

I’d like nothing more than to end our losing streak at Lambeau. I don’t see it happening. The Packers went 11-5 in an “off” year. They’ll be returning all of their key players from that team and are traditionally excellent at adding through the draft and developing players. It is likely to turn into a shootout, and they’ll be coming off a bye.

---

**Week 6 @ Cleveland:**

Our last of 4 road games in the first 6 weeks. Fortunately, but on offense they are like a weaker version of the Vikings. If we can score a couple TDs that’s probably all we’ll need. It’s likely to be a good game for Burleson and Broyles, as they lack CB depth past Haden. 

---

**Week 7 Vs. Cincinnati:**

I also think the Bengals are a tough team to predict. Their offense doesn’t have much bite beyond Green, but beyond that their defense isn’t stellar anymore. Linebacker and safety are both weak positions for them so we could have success in both the short and deep pass game, although we’ll likely have to get rid of the ball fast.

---

**Week 8 Vs. Dallas:**

This is likely to be one of the most exciting games we play this season. Two teams with great passing attacks. With Witten, and Murray, I think their offense is probably more well rounded than ours, but I also think our defense has a better secondary and will have a great matchup against their weak interior O-line. There will likely be an extensive highlight reel from this game, hopefully they’re mostly ours. Hopefully Durant doesn’t have a game against us the way Palmer did against the Cowboys last time.

---

**Week 9 Bye:**

Not sure you can get a better bye week and for us it’s particularly valuable to get our guys healthy going into weeks 10 and 11.

---

**Week 10 @ Chicago:**

This is probably the best game of the season to have after a bye. The Bears coaching staff will have had enough time to get things evened out by now

---

**Week 11 @ Pittsburgh:**

Even though the Steelers don’t scare me as much as they used to, Dwyer is the best they’ve got and he’s not great. Their defense is good, not great right now, and isn’t likely to get better as the year goes on with 5 starters over 30, some of whom struggle with injuries already. I would not be horribly surprised to see the Steelers end up at the bottom of the AFC North this year, but realize that that is a pretty bold prediction.

---

**Week 12 Vs. Tampa Bay:**

It’s a good thing we get this game at home, but that was 2010 and he’s gotten better since and so has Stafford. Pass rush probably won’t be too big of a concern with Bennett gone, but we’re not going to be able to get much going in the run game against that D-line. On offense, they’ve got weapons to do some serious damage. We’ll see if Freeman is developing.

---

**Week 13 Vs. Green Bay:**

Still a ridiculously tough game. Not much different from the last one

---

**Week 14 @ Philadelphia:**

I would have rather seen the Eagles early in the season, so this late in the season that could be a major issue for them.

---

**Week 15 Vs. Baltimore:**

Probably the toughest game on our schedule other than the Packers games. They pretty well replaced their losses in FA

---

**Week 16 Vs. Giants:**

A good game to have at home, as well as depth all over the field. They are weak at WR beyond Nicks and Cruz, their LBs are less than inspiring, their secondary may be lacking this year too. They can put up a bunch of points but will likely give up a ton too.

---

**Week 17 @ Minnesota:**

I love the bookends on the season with Minnesota. It wraps the regular seasons story up perfectly. Hard to tell where both teams will be by this point. It could end up being a game with playoff implications for either or both teams

---

&gt;6th Seed - Detroit
Wins tie break over New Orleans and Seattle based on strength of victory. Division tie break was initially used to eliminate Tampa Bay (New Orleans wins tie break over Tampa Bay based on head-to-head win percentage).

Okay, I don't think this scenario is completely ridiculous. Maybe PHI getting to 6-10, or the entire NFC east besides NYG being 6-10 is a little ridiculous. 

Do I expect this to happen? No. But it's not out of the question anyways. The tough win will be vs CHI

Anyway, Keiland Williams impressed me a lot. I thought Young also showed why he's an up and coming WR. Broyles also looked pretty good, but there wasn't much his way.

I haven't heard anything about Logan yet

Kellen Moore, if any, but his other throws were very good. The o-line by then just wasn't very good. 

Talking about the o-line... I thought they looked excellent! Rieff also looked great and is maybe why Williams had just a great day. 

Pettigrew also looked a lot better. I don't recall a dropped pass. That's his biggest problem from becoming elite. He's already top 10

We, Martin Mayhew, do his thing for the past few years. To see our team improve so much from drafting, I think Lions fans have become increasingly educated on all off-season topics and team management.

With this being said

* A simulated play-through of the 2013 season to start.
* Discussion posts and poll-style voting on re-signing decisions .
* Discussion posts and poll-style voting on staff signing.
* Discussion posts and poll-style voting on rookie scouting.
* Discussion posts and poll-style voting on drafting.
* Discussion posts and poll-style voting on free-agency.
* Discussion posts and poll-style voting on depth-charting.
* Discussion posts and poll-style voting on roster cuts.
* Lather

I won't be recording any video. I would be posting team information in the form of text

I think it would be really fun for everyone on this sub-reddit to test and see how well were are at managing a team

How often I would start a discussion post or a voting poll would depend on what you guys want. I think it would be great if we could do a season in 6 days (Aug. 29-Sept. 04) As to not flood this subreddit with posts unrelated to the regular season which would start. Then

Would anybody be interested in this?

Let me start by saying how disappointed I am with this year's Detroit Lions. The potential for this roster is huge yet they seem to find a way to remain ""the same ole' Lions"". So, as an organization, make it right?

-COACHING: I'll admit from the start, Linehan, or even the whole coaching staff. On these points, there is one that I can partially agree with: Linehan. Linehan's playcalling is as predictable as can be. We all know this but he doesn't have a lot to work with. Yes, we have an explosive offense through the air but the problem is, everyone knows that. Even with the threat of Calvin Johnson and Co., we still can't seem to consistently have a running threat. Burleson said it best after last year's Cowboys game...""they say we're a one trick pony (referring to megatron)...well, there are times when we're all scratching our heads or facepalming at a playcall

Now, and has an attitude but he needs to be able to keep himself in check. Has Schwartz lost his cool? Yup. Has he made mistakes? Absolutely. However, I think, overall, the guy has done a good job and has earned at least one more year to show whether the real Lions are last years Lions or this years Lions. 

Firing the coaching staff will set this team back into rebuilding mode. I truly believe they just need some ""tweaking"" in a few areas. 

-MAHEW: I think he started out very strong as a GM but has certainly made some bad decisions. I don't need to go into detail about past draft picks

Let me just say this, financially, to keep 3 stars from the previous CBA. Yes, megatron has a new contract but I don't see how we are able to keep both Stafford and Suh without the rest of the team suffering. Obviously, based on my flair, i'm a Stafford supporter and don't want him going anywhere. Speaking of Suh...",,self,lions1,

--------------------

My thoughts:

**Round 1:** Good pick and fine by me. I liked Janoris Jenkins and thought he was worth it

**Round 2:** Very odd and a huge shocker. Had to think about this one for a second to see why he was picked. In short, fine, but I don't really get the point of it. In terms of needs and the impact of the needs filled, I just don't get it. Janoris Jenkins fell to #7 in the 2nd round. There were two scenarios we should have done. 1) Take Reiff #1, then trade up to take Jenkins in the 2nd or 2) Take Jenkins #1 and then address the o-line in the 2nd round with either Peter Konz or Mike Adams. Broyles is a good WR there's no doubt there, but he wasn't the BPA by a stretch. From what I've read, the Lions were never taking Jenkins no matter where he fell, and smoking weed. Chances are if he was in a different state, we only address our return game.

**Round 3:** Excellent pick. Addresses our secondary problem and got a good value with the pick. Could have been a second round pick easily. 

**Round 4:** Odd player for this defense, but who knows.

**Round 5.1:** Want the secondary fixed? Well, nearly 200lbs and can run a 4.4. Can be our sleeper pick of the entire draft. Did I mention he's a local player out of Detroit?

**Round 5.2:** This... This is the worst pick in the entire NFL draft this year. He won't be a OLB on this team. He will be on special teams if he even makes the team. We gave up a 4th round next year for him. He was projected to go in the seventh round or be undrafted. Horrible pick. Leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

**Round 6:** Very odd pick... Can't say much but that he runs a straight 4.4 and is 5'11. Was projected to go undrafted. I can only assume the front office has been watching him and liked him a lot.

**Round 7:** First off, but will he return to what he was early in his Oklahoma career? It's nice there's that Oklahoma LB connection, but how much is that worth? Would have preferred to have just taken him instead of Whitehead and then Moore with this pick or even RB Chris Polk.

Walterfootball.com grading:

23. Riley Reiff
History repeats itself. Two years ago, and Reiff was the best player on the board. Great move.

54. Ryan Broyles
Hmm... maybe the Vikings should have drafted Morris Claiborne after all. This is crazy. If Ryan Broyles pans out, should be a good player for Matthew Stafford, who will need someone to throw to once Calvin Johnson suffers from the Madden Curse. I have to wonder though, why not improve the defense? I feel like there were better prospects available, but I don't have a problem with this selection.

85. Dwight Bentley
The Lions do what they do most of the time - they select the best player available. Dwight Bentley could have possibly been selected at the very end of Round 2

125. Ronnell Lewis
I'm not sure how the hell Ronnell Lewis fell into Round 4 (let alone Round 3). The Bills are getting a major steal. They don't need a linebacker in terms of a starter

138. Tahir Whitehead
I thought the Lions took the best player available? Tahir Whitehead was a seventh-round prospect. I also don't see how he fits into Detroit's defense. He should have been drafted by a team to be a 3-4 rush linebacker.

148. Chris Greenwood
No surprise that the Lions selected a second cornerback. They really needed help at the position. Chris Greenwood has good upside and fits the range in the middle of Round 5.

196. Jonte Green
Detroit really wants to fix the cornerback position. I don't think many people had Jonte Green as a draftable prospect

223. Travis Lewis
Another Oklahoma linebacker. Another steal. Another A+. This new Lions regime knows how to draft. The only question is

We have one of the most feared defensive lines in football and have drafted loads of other young, talented players with lots of upside. We have not had this much talent or potential in a long time if we ever have at all. 

However, the bad apples need to be weeded out and clearly, there are still some holes to be filled. Mayhew and company know how to make that happen.

Take the Saints for example. In 2006, the Saints finished 10-6 and made it to the NFC championship game. Over the next two years, they continued to build their team adding the talents of Jeremy Shockey, Tracy Porter, Sedrick Ellis and Jonathan Vilma. Nevertheless, the Saints took a step back and went 7-9 in 2007 and 8-8 in 2008. Their patience and finally paid off in 2009 when the Saints went 13-3 and won the Super Bowl.

This is the difference between our staff and the staff of a competent organization.  

Logan is not Valverde (Tigers' reference). He has no history of actually doing well as a return man. He does have a history of fumbles.

What other teams would keep him on returns? SO many other teams would have replaced him by now. This just continues to prove my idea of how stubborn this staff is. They refuse to adapt to the current situation and just grind it out for no reason. It's show on and off the field. 

I'm so fucking raged right now I can't stand it. Not only does our defensive special teams blow

I just don't get it. At all. You have Edwards and Broyles. Both AMAZING returners in college. Yet

As far as I'm concered the season is over with. I doubt we beat Seattle. They have an amazing defense and Lynch is going to put up 80 yards. The only way we win is shutting down Wilson, 4-6, Texans, 4-7, Colts, 5-7, GB, Cards, Chicago

The talent being wasted is just depressing. The fact our schedule is harder this year is just magnifying the issue with the play calling and coaching staff. It's that simple. It doesn't matter if we have turnovers. This team is built to strike back and match teams. The defense is made to shut down teams. The defense is actually improved this year and Linehan is just giving games away, make them simpler. This isn't the Patriots. We don't need complex plays because we lack talent.  The only thing keeping this team from dropping to a top 10 draft pick is this defense and considering how glassy the secondary is, I doubt it'll last all season.

For starters, were mostly unaffected. They live lives of luxury and were, like I said, for the most part, unaffected because of their quality of living. The players had to overcome nothing because of Katrina. 

Second reason, Matt, and Suh, were all drafted. The top 3 players in New Orleans, Brees, Nicks, and Evans. Brees was acquired, only Evans is a true breed Saint.

Third reason is their attitude. Saints fans say they can act the way they act because of their history of being bottom feeders. This is ridiculous. There have been many good seasons for the Saints in which they fell just a touchdown or two short of a superbowl run. 

Fourth reason is their stadium. Jesus Christ, it's not all about your plain logo.

Fifth reason is their unbelievably ignorant and infuriating response to the clear evidence of a pay-for-performance and bounty system.

A lot happened this week that changed our playoff situation. If you think any of what I say here is wrong

First of all, and although they face the Saints in New Orleans next week, they get Tampa Bay at home the following. It would be surprising for them not to get at least one win and that, I predict, is the number we will also get.

It gets a little brighter after that.

Thanks to a Giants loss, and the Lions hold the tiebreaker there. There are several other possible scenarios surrounding who finishes where in the NFC East, but it is irrelevant in terms of the wild card.

Seattle and Arizona both won, because if we win one more there is no way they can catch us in wins. Of course if we don't get another win, we still may be alright. Since they meet in week 17 it is only possible for one of those teams to get to 9 wins. The Seahawks face 49ers next week and the Cards have to play the Bengals in Cin City. Let's just say, I'm not picking either of them to win, but even if one of them does, the other has a good shot to win the week 17 meeting and play spoiler. Of course, all of this is entirely moot if we manage to get one more win.

Chicago... Poor Chicago... Their last two games are away games within the division

Basically

What follows is purely conjecture.

What happened at Arrowhead today could not have been better for us. 

First of all

It's safe to assume that the Packers main goal at this point is to get the #1 seed. I'm not positive about this

That leads me to our meeting with them in week 17. The Packers will likely be sitting at 14-1, but they learned a tough lesson by losing Jennings last week and may chose to sit some of their players for insurance. The Lions on the other hand, if they lose next week, will be giving it every ounce of effort they've got to secure the wildcard. It's not a game a favor the Lions in under most circumstances, but we may see an exception.

1339921146.0,v68gj,A deceptively good offseason so far. Sleep on us at your own risk.,sosuhme,16,2,7,"There has been so much pessimism surrounding the Lions since the season ended. I don't think it's warranted.

I'll start with the perceived issues.

First of all, or the offseason conduct of our 2011 draft class.

Also

On top of that, Tulloch, Spievey, and others have been dealing with injuries.

From a casual perspective, who is paying a lot of attention, I feel that most of the doubt surrounding the team is largely misplaced.

Let's talk about discipline. 

First

Fairley has also publicly apologized. He sounded sincere and from a statement Cunningham made it sounded as though he got plenty of discipline from inside the organization. What got lost in all this is that he was a monster in the weight room this offseason and has been also performing very well at practices. He will likely face a suspension of at least 2 games

LeShoure really impressed me with his public statement, he was apparently running and making breaks without hesitation. It seems he is either completely healed, or nearly there. He faces a two game suspension, but at least one of those games we should be able to win without his help. The San Fran game is going to be tough either way and it's too bad he won't be there, but Smith should be able to carry the load early in the season.

Who cares about Culbreathe? Sorry to be crass but I'd be surprised if he makes the roster.

Now in terms of discipline as a team, Schwartz was able to get things reigned in a bit by the end of the year. The number of penalties stayed higher than we want, but personal fouls dropped off entirely(I think). The team stopped acting like a bunch of morons on the field. It has been eluded to enough times to satisfy me that the team is addressing the issue whole heartedly, and I think the public statements by Schwartz, as well as the 2011 draft class players, have been some specific evidence of that. Everyone is being held accountable. I don't expect us to have a league low penalties in 2012, especially with the aggressive nature of our defense

I'm sure most of you know the good and bad parts about the draft

I too was curious when we took a WR with our second round pick. As things develop I have less and less concern about it though. Firstly, but would like have have been taken shortly after the Lions took him anyway. As far as the injury is concerned, everything I've read seems to suggest he is ahead of schedule. Although he hasn't been active in any full contact practices yet, he has been participating in drills since the OTAs started. He should be ready by training camp to play. He'll have more practice likely than Young had before he played in the regular season last year. It looks at though Young will likely get used more in the return game, which will not limit him greatly in the offense, but enough I expect that Broyles will get a fair number of snaps as the #3 in 2012. In the long term, he is an ideal replacement for Burleson and I have no problem with the pick at all.

It's hard to figure out who will and won't work out among the rest of the draft class, and LB.

Avril's slightly overblown sense of self worth doesn't bother me that much. He's motivated to stay fit and come out and dominate this year in hopes of getting a new contract from someone. The stupidest thing he could do to himself is holdout, and while his presence adds to our overall DLine, his absence doesn't cause major chemistry issues for the group. Hopefully he signs a contract for a long time at a reasonable price, but if he doesn't, and he ends up elsewhere next year, I won't lose sleep over it, especially if we take a new DE in the early rounds next year like we should anyway.

Tullochs injury worries me much more

The other significant players with injuries are seemingly making great progress. Best, so I don't think there is too much cause for worry, aside from the ever present risk to reinjure, but that's nothing new. As a side note on Spievey, it seems clear that he has been made aware that this is his last chance to step up or move aside. I hope he steps up, but if he gets relegated to back and we put someone else in, it might be an upgrade anyway.

Actually, or will be, at least as good as Wright was, maybe better, and if Lacey's late season performances last year were an indication of the direction of his level of play, he should be a great nickel CB. Safety depth is still the larger issue as Delmas's injury last year had a noticeable effect on the quality of secondary play. Coleman has been having a very good offseason, and would be a good backup for Spievey, I think the secondary will also benefit from the presence of Fairley once he returns from suspension. Even a slight improvement on our pass rush from the DL will help players like Spievey make big plays and raise their level of play.

Overall, and Green Bay at least once. Houston is tough, but I don't think they're that much better than us. I'm sure we will drop some games, but I don't expect to see the Lions out of any of their games this season and I do expect to see some dominant performances.",,False,self,1340205595.0,t3_v68gj
