""you aren't cool/interesting enough to wear that""

1356043681.0,156y9m,we make noise not posts: undercoverism,trashpile,60,2,23,"Let's talk about undercoverism

Jun Takahashi is a shy guy who makes clothes under the Undercoverism label. The label started in 1989 when Jun (nickname Jonio for his affinity for and similarities to Sex Pistols singer Johnny Rotten) was attending Bunka Fashion College. He was initially just making clothes for his friends and would only sell to people who had some kind of approval: a positive introduction, they made money and a new store was opened in Aoyama. The west really started to take note of the brand in 2003, after the Scab show. This is when the first interviews with Jun from western publications start.

In my opinion, he said ""they're clothes for women."" Simple. The initial efforts are all very punk driven in the vein of the Sex Pistols and similarly '77 styled crust punks. As time goes on, the punk elements of frayed edges, deconstruction and anarchy hold true until the late 2000s. With the Dieter Rams-inspired ""Less But Better"" collection in ss2010, Jun states that he's taking the ""Less But Better"" concept of minimalism in clothing with him into the future and it shows. Some argue that the previous incarnation of clothes were cooler, but I feel that it just changes the volume of the statement.

Jun has an interesting relationship with the runway. He'll leave, as with the underman season. This is coupled by a wish to not move at the pace of the seasons (though he does) as well as his desire to stay out of the public light

Undercover clothes have a lot of recurring motifs. References to music, the raw hems, darts in interesting places, cropped pants, prints where prints wouldn't normally be, [vent holes](http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lij9ueR9ti1qe5o8zo1_500.jpg), technical fabrics, mixing constructions of two different garments,"" ""we make noise not clothes, undercoverism

Jun also runs the brand AFFA (anarchy forever forever anarchy), but is generally more toned down and more street. Good luck finding it not in japan.The Undercover x Uniqlo collaboration in 2011-2012 was a bit of a shock because it had been only a few years since Jun had stated that he disapproved of brands going over to fast fashion, as it was a money grab. His reversal of opinion is noted in one of the interviews below. The Gyakusou line started when Nike approached him after his GIRA (Gyakusou [which means running backwards, as they run against traffic] International Running Association) and asked him to design some things for him. He disliked many of the things available and noted that color is very important, as is harmony. He promotes Nike as having the best fabrics in the world, which works nicely with his technical aesthetic.

I call bullshit. The challenge the idea that authenticity is even really a 'thing' and, I wanted to bring this up for discussion. Authenticity is to men as being cute is to women: a vague notion that we measure against but will probably always fail to attain.


Some discussion points:

1) Is 'authenticity' real? If so

2) What brands are 'authentic'?

3) Why is menswear (or men in general) obsessed with the idea of authenticity?

4) Does it matter from a fashion perspective if something is authentic? 

5) How does the idea of ""value"" (as in

1359744774.0,17pij8,"Labels, Tags, Branding",germinal,37,71

Anyway I'm a huge nerd and I'm interested in the design choices of the brands we know and love especially regarding the labels

I keep the tags of all the clothes I buy in a box in my wardrobe. I started doing this just mainly just in case I came to sell anything on, which I suppose is meant to communicate luxury etc. but I find that quite boring. Interesting and unconventional use of materials that can communicate the brand's ethos to the consumer is the ultimate goal here, I think. Junya's blue acetate is probably the most interesting one that I can think of off the top of my head.

Similarly the actual labels inside the clothes is wasted potential for many brands. Some I particularly like: Rick Owens' parallel labels; ditto Robert Geller; Margiela's original white labels; White Mountaineering's white-on-white embroidery; Facetasm's test card. I like it when additional information is included

Finally branding. A topic that probably deserves its own thread. Rejection of branding seems to be a natural part of first getting into clothes, be it something as blatant as Thom Browne's tricolour, as subtle as Margiela's pick stitches or something that was initially part of the design, but has come to represent the brand as a whole such as the central back seam on Rick's t-shirts. Examples of branding I like: White Mountaineering's hang hook detail; WTAPS; Common Projects' golden numbers; the mighty swoosh etc. There's loads more I'm sure but I'm running out of steam.

When I started writing I had other stuff to say and more examples but I've forgotten. It'll come back to me. Hopefully there's enough here to start a bit of discussion",self,t5_2seq5,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashion/comments/17pij8/labels_tags_branding/

Wednesday: **Shopping List** -- post what's on your shopping list. It can be an extravagant item you're saving up to buy once you become a billionaire

Thurs: **Item of the Week** -- each week we'll focus on a particular mens item (oxfords

Please be patient as we sort through and experiment with these over the next few weeks. We may roll out more, depending on what **you guys**, the subscriber, want.

Now, but I'll try and update fairly regularly with links to the collections. I'm going to be really busy today (which is ok because Monday probably has the worst line-up), but with any luck I should find some time in the evening.

The easiest way to watch the shows is either through [Now Fashion](http://nowfashion.com), who should feature highlights on their highlights page, funnily enough. 

Hopefully through these three sources and some googling we'll be able to see pics for just about everything.

Since MF is pretty slow this thread should easily suffice for all three days

Please note: 

* This is intended to be a novice-friendly environment

* Close-minded people do not make for good discussion and are not welcome. I certainly don't expect anyone to like or even 'get' every designer

* I hope that this thread can operate fairly autonomously

now, common sense, so expect that. but tell me what you want *sale or not* and i'll *try* to pick it up in your size.

1. look on cosstore webshop and find something you like

2. make a comment on this thread stating what you'd like

3. send a 50% deposit of 1.04 * 1.08 * (price of cos piece online) to adhi5000@gmail.com using the 'payment for goods' option. include your username and your item in the memo of the payment, so convert to usd and send that much*

4. i will visit the store and buy as much as i can that was requested

1362154639.0,19gv8y,Maison Martin Margiela Duvet Coat,solar_garden,32,7,4,"I wrote this for a class I am taking. Academic fashion as it were. I figured some people may find it interesting. It's a bit dry though. disregard if there are spelling errors. 

some pictures of the coat [one](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lpkkhlGYmD1qh78jlo1_500.jpg)

Question: In what way is this garment characteristic of Martin Margiela’s design philosophy?


  This question is not appropriate for a number of reasons. First of all, the term ‘design philosophy’ is far too broad of a descriptor to be able to work with constructively.  It is more appropriate and useful to inquire as to whether the Duvet coat contains themes that are consistent throughout Maison Martin Margiela’s collections.
	

  Three main themes that are present in many of the house’s collections can also be found in the Duvet coat. The first concept is the questioning of the experience of creating and wearing a garment (which is frequently termed deconstruction). The second is the idea of reproduction. The third theme is the concept behind Margiela’s ‘Artisanal’ line (Line 0) which combines the two previous themes and also introduces the factors time and re-appropriation. 
	

   The Duvet coat was part of the Autumn/Winter 1999-2000 collection. The coat was manufactured by Featherlight, pre 2008). The Duvet coat is square with detachable sleeves and designed to lie flat. The shoulders are not defined and the sleeves applied to the surface of the duvet. It can be worn as a coat, a waistcoat, and a wrap. A series of duvet covers made out of various materials such as wool (which can be worn separately as a coat), denim, and clear PVC for the rain can be worn over the duvet for protection. Vintage bed sheets were also remade into covers. They can also be worn alone as dresses. Margiela did not hold a runway show for this collection (something they have done frequently) and instead invited buyers to a showroom to watch a film, directed by Martin Margiela, not many photos of this collection are available. 
	
Margiela is often described as a deconstructionist, deconstruction does not mean destruction (nor is it possible to define clearly). She argues that Margiela brings to light the ‘bi-directionality’ of the labor of creating and wearing clothes. When making a garment, the material is both formed and deformed, create and destroyed. Likewise, in wearing an item of clothing, the body is formed and deformed.  By exposing these conflicts through exposed seams, and unconventional materials, the material is somewhat unconventional for a coat. Down coats exist, it eschews the convention of creating a garment that follows the shape of the body. There are no defined shoulders on the coat; rather
	
Another theme that is present throughout the work of Maison Martin Margiela is the idea of reproduction. Every season they produce a collection within the men’s and women’s lines of garments consisting of very close replicas of a found item of clothing. The label will state where and when the original garment if from. Margiela is also interested in reproducing items from their own archive. For the Autumn/Winter 1993 collection, Margiela chose to commission an actual bed linens company to create the coat. Although it is still a coat, attention has been paid to making seem as close to a duvet as possible. The flatness and the ability to remove the sleeves also supports its “duvet-ness.” The duvet coat is not part of the replica line, but it still continues to show an appreciation for replication, and highlights the industrial basis of replication
	
Re-appropriation is a crucial theme to Margiela’s collections. Every season they produce an Artisanal line (which has been shown as the label’s Haute Couture collection since 2008) that reworks vintage garments to create new combinations.  This connects back to the theme of deconstruction as Margiela is redefining the usage of a garment and giving it a new life. The Artisanal line also shows Margiela’s interest in fashion history. Through this interest in history, although the coat is innovative and new, it still owes a debt to the past through the covers and also through its construction. There is another layer of appropriation in that the the duvet covers can be re-worn as a dress, further questioning the expectations about what a duvet cover (or any other item of clothing or furnishing) should or should not do. 
	
Although the Duvet coat is not explicitly indicative of Maison Martin Margiela’s conceptions about what clothes should mean and do

1346795488.0,zcw6h,lets have another discussion about this place,cameronrgr,29,9,15,"a couple weeks ago we had a nice forum about this sub and where we wanted to see it go.  since then we've had some WAYWT threads with a little success

there are basically three kinds of internet 'fashion' resources-- shitty tumblrs, sufu, SF, etc.  

When i started posting to reddit a year ago, and teckneaks has taken it upon himself to do something with this place, for which i applaud him.  the WAYWT's we've had are small but intimate.  not that we can't do better, but for once this sub has some actual content.

since his initiative this place hasn't blown up but we can all agree the content is basically better.  the users are generally more knowledgable and interested in fashion as a hobby, and is basically banal, pedestrian shit that should be on MFA.  i think the place could use a little stricter moderating as to what hits the front page, but we also have so little content that it's not an issue yet.

MFA has a special place in my heart and we can't talk about this place without talking about MFA but MFA also sucks dick.   seeing people go +30 in recent purchases week after week for buying aldens and epaulet chinos kills the penis.  

I know teckneaks wants (wanted?) to take this place in a different direction from MFA but i honestly think the MFA schema works fine.  i would love to see this place be formally similar but different (better) content wise-- a tighter group of people with more directed interests.  i'd be happy to see and contribute to recent purchase/gen discussion type threads here-- happy to continue WIWT, n1c, y_control et al -- we have a decent amount of users from the MFA irc community.  it wouldnt take much more to bring up the discourse here.  i love the sufu community, and it's impossible to reproduce in MFA but i think this place has some promise?

Anyways

I was checking out rafsimons.com today. First thing you see is the film on SS13 and it's quite something. It's weird. I can't really describe it to justce, 30 of them, each linking to another section. It's not really organized in any specific way, and the music changes with each picture. I spent a minute or two on each picture, trying to gain some kind of extra meaning from it but I realized that it's basically impossible with out being a close follower of his designs or reading up on editorialized reports on him.

Also

It looks damn cool, anything that Raf found worthy of publishing in Raf Simons Redux must be of some contextually discovered importance.

I'm reposting here in hopes that it will get more traction. I've added the few suggestions provided and can add more as they come in. Although it may technically be a personal request

Good Day All

Over the course of my sartorial adventures I've found my preference lean towards a more European fit and style. That is, when there has been an opportunity to travel, sit marvelously on my atypical frame. Although analogues can be found from american retailers the fit always seems to be a bit off.

I've been searching for online retailers that sell and ship at a reasonable price to NA. Here's what I've got so far. If you've ordered from any of them

- [ASOS](http://www.asos.com/) is pretty obvious.
- I've had some luck with [Herrenausstatter](http://www.herrenausstatter.de/)
- [Boozt](http://www.boozt.com/eu/en) out of Sweden looks ok
- [Zara](http://www.zara.com/) another popular choice. 
- [River Island](http://www.riverisland.com/) Low prices and ships just about anywhere
- [Chemical Rrecords UK](http://http://www.chemical-records.co.uk) Street/Skate with a touch of haberdashery

I thought this would be a good opportunity for our well traveled members or perhaps those who live in Europe to offer suggestions.

Thanks.

'summer is bad for fashion [sic]' - germinal may 2012


I don't think this is true but I think  it's bad for the people who use a bunch of clothes to hide from.  I think mfa loves layering partially because you can hide your bad posture or face or low confidence in all those colors and textures and ideas.  for instance if you compare mclankylegs fit with the original derk shot the difference isn't at all in the clothes

in the summer you have so fewer clothes to hide behind.  a t shirt reveals your body more than an ocbd.  you can't use some gimmicky garment combination to draw attention from yourself.  generally you have a lot less to work with so it's a much more minimalist affair

that was a bit of a tangent, shorts, sneakers without socks.  a long sleeve tied around the waist is truly the best way for a man to capture the volume and look of a skirt",,False,self,t5_2seq5,,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashion/comments/1c09r7/today_is_the_first_day_of_summer/

I've begun to understand the value of good grooming, this is around the same time that I decided to downsize on possessions so that they can fit in a bag and I can get up and travel at any time.

So is there such thing as an all-weather suit? And can I have good dress shirts that don't look like they are going to rip with continued use? Is there a boot that looks good in the club *and* good on the ground?

I'll step up and make this thread since it's been on my mind and it was basically [requested](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashion/comments/zcw6h/lets_have_another_discussion_about_this_place/). I'm going to assume if you hate Thom Browne you think this sucks too

My thoughts:

* Thom Browne has no idea how a diffusion line works. Ties are a little more affordable,pd.html?cgid=men&amp;index=4) and $290 vs $195 for an oxford is still out of reach for most people. [Thom Browne varsity jacket is $1340](http://www.barneys.com/Thom-Browne-Letterman-Jacket/502064155,default,pd.html?cgid=men&amp;index=25) and [Thom Grey varsity jacket s $1180](http://www.barneys.com/Thom-Grey-Striped-Letterman-Jacket/502141407,default,pd.html?cgid=men&amp;index=14).

* While we're on the subject

* Barney's does a terrible job styling Thom Browne. Most of these pictures make the clothes look awful.

* I like a few items,pd.html?cgid=men&amp;index=12) and the scarves, but not for that price. Overall the collection just feels kind of mashed together, like half-assed versions of his mainline. For a more affordable Thom Browne I'll stick to Black Fleece.",,False,self,False,t3_zdmli

I love that purchase and it has been my go-to pair for casual occasions. It's certainly something different than the jeans and chinos that 9 out of 10 people wear on the streets. The pattern is noticable yet not too loud. I really think that more guys should consider owning a pair of houndstooth pants.
