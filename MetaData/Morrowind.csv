So yeah, Scotland and Iceland).


This means that I will no longer have the chance to contribute at least one post a day for this wonderful subreddit.


This is of course no goodbye forever - plans can change
However


I hope the mods allow this self-post. I just want you guys to know that I'm not dead or anything if I no longer post here

If you browse /r/morrowind frequently
I on the other hand noticed that I started to open Morrowind just for the sake of finding something to post on /r/Morrowind way too much lately. And that's simply not the point of the game and this subreddit.

So I came to the conclusion that I will no longer post OC on this subreddit. Before I made my first post in /r/Morrowind I promised myself to end on a high point of my ""career"" and that I won't force unoriginal OC just for the sake of delivering.

I hope that this post doesn't make me look like a self-centered/pretentious guy

I would like to close this post by thanking everyone for your honesty and kind words concerning my submissions - I upvoted every single comment of you guys.

He was just a puppy and now I'm 19 he's old and tired.

(I went by ""Neuman"" back then)  I remember we did most of the work in 2003 and 2004

Anyway, developing medical simulators through the University of Buffalo Virtual Reality Lab.  It was pretty cool, because I never really thought I'd use all that 3D Studio Max knowledge.  But the fact that I'm a biomedical engineer with a modicum of artistic ability, makes my skill set ideal for virtual reality medical simulation.  So if anyone else out there is (or was) interested in being a game developer too, just a heads up: try looking into virtual reality development, since the skill set is very similar, and it's a lot less competitive.  The pay is probably better too.

Someone asked how this mod came about

&gt; Originally, meaning that it didn't bend as the body moved.  The only parts that could deform were the chest and the hands, and everything else was essentially wooden.  [Picture for comparison between our models and the original ones.](http://i.imgur.com/U9Zu9.jpg)

&gt; Originally, I released ""Neuman's Black Leather"", in which I tried to add some stuff like shorter skirts or whatever for the female characters, because there was a lot of demand among modders for that type of model.  It frustrated me that the clothes models couldn't fit on top of the body models, so it was impossible to make low-cut shirts, or anything that went lower than the neck, since any shirt-type clothing would replace the entire chest model.  It was also impossible to have short-sleeved shirts, which required you to make like eight copies of any given item.  When you picked up an item in the game

&gt; Eventually, and have multiple models within that file.  That's not how the original character modeler did it, but that would be the *correct* way to do it using the engine they had.  (Later I found out that the character modeler was the wife of one of their top developers.  She wasn't very good at her job, but she was very nice and everyone at Bethesda liked her.  Eh.)  Anyway, from there, I realized that you could make a body model all in one piece, break it up into the various parts (chest, foot

&gt; In case you can't tell, and attached it to a character, then posted it on Bethesda's forums, with the title ""Better body models?""  I hadn't really expected that to turn into a mod, I was just expecting to show other people how it could be done.  But the title of the thread stuck as a name.

&gt; I was kind of fumbling around and was learning as I went, Nightstrider, offered to do the skin textures, and she set up a forum on her website (subtlelucidity, I'd be shocked if anyone remembered *those* forums).  There, another modder, Zenorf, and I was a bit pissed too, so we all moved to the Psychodog Studios forums

&gt; So yeah

As, then worked at a few really boring engineering jobs, until I decided to go back to grad school.  There, I got involved in the University of Buffalo's [Virtual Reality Lab](http://www.vrlab.buffalo.edu) where I got involved with designing medical simulators for training surgeons to use surgical robots.  I'm working commercializing that simulator now, at [Simulated Surgical Systems, a company in Lancaster, New York.](http://www.simulatedsurgicals.com/)  It's cool, I'm the only one that has any experience with the artistic side of 3D modeling.  Also, for our simulator.

I'm not sure what all questions anyone would want to ask me, but I'll answer any I get.  Certainly for the weekend, anyway.  I'll keep checking back here every so often, though I may not be able to every day if I'm busy.",,False,,1367286520.0,t3_16wna5

1359362232.0,17f4yv,[Guide] Vanilla Morrowind Improved,Forefall,147,17,37,"This is my first post on Reddit

---

**Why Vanilla?** 

---

Because, and I feel was the most -complete- Elder Scrolls game out of the box, without resorting to mods. 


---

**I've tried vanilla Morrowind.  It's not for me.**

---

Install [Morrowind Overhaul 3.0](http://www.ornitocopter.net/morrowind-overhaul/) and look on the web for recommended mods.  This guide is not for you.

---

**Which version should I get?**

---

The Steam version is certainly the easier route.  However, and settle for the Steam version.  This guide is for GOTY disc version users, but applies fine to Steam users as well.

---

**Installing Morrowind**

---

*Quick Version*

For the GOTY / Steam version, please follow this installation order:

Morrowind &gt; Tribunal &gt; [Tribunal v1.4.1313 Patch](http://download.zenimax.com/elderscrolls/morrowind/patches/tribunal_v1.4.1313.exe) &gt; Bloodmoon &gt; [Bloodmoon v1.6.1820 Patch](http://download.zenimax.com/elderscrolls/morrowind/patches/Bloodmoon_v1.6.1820.exe)

Install Morrowind to a root directory (e.g. C:\Morrowind

---

**(Optional) Install the official mods**

---

These mods are by Bethesda themselves, so this is entirely up to you. 

[Download the official mods here](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Official_Plug-ins).

To install the mods, extract the contents of the .zip files into this folder.  For the Firemoth mod, open the .zip, navigate into the Data Files folder inside the .zip, and extract the contents of that file into your Morrowind Data Files folder.

**Be sure to activate these mods** - run the Morrowind Launcher

---

**(Optional) Enable Pixel Shaders (improved water)**

---

Run the Morrowind Launcher and select ""Options"".  Enable Pixel Shading.  Water will be greatly improved

---

**Install Patches/Fixes**

---

**Morrowind FPS Optimizer**

[Download](http://www.lowgenius.net/post/2008/05/23/Morrowind-FPS-Optimizer.aspx#.UQYTx7_a8q8)

This is the FPS optimizer.  It can be used to allow widescreen resolutions and custom Field of View options.  This is not going to be used to improve the graphics of the game

Open the .zip

Run mw_fps_opt.exe - uncheck ""novice mode"".  Click ""change Morrowind registry settings here"" and set your native resolution.  

Next

Next, but your mileage my vary depending on your preferences. 

Continuing, then right click again and click ""disable selected"").  This gets rid of the annoying ""object popping"" that the FPS optimizer comes with.  

Close FPS optimizer and continue with the guide.

*As a side note, integrated graphics, etc), these settings are highly useful.  You can use the middle mouse scroll wheel to adjust the view distance dynamically, and it will change the view distance automatically depending on your FPS - you can set your desired minimum FPS here as well.

**Morrowind Code Patch**

[Download](http://morrowind.nexusmods.com/mods/19510)

This is probably the most important step.  Open the code patch's .zip file and extract everything to your Morrowind directory.  Run the ""Morrowind Code Patch.exe"" in administrator mode (just in case, 8 users) by right clicking the file and selecting ""Run as Administrator"".  

I recommend just using the default options if you're not familiar with the game

* Loud interface sounds fix
* Swift casting (highly recommended)
* Shortcut key improvements (this is a preference thing)
* Unrestrict menu size
* Permanent barter disposition change (highly recommended)
* Racial variation in speed fix
* On-use ring extra slot

When done choosing your options

**4GB Patch**

[Download](http://www.ntcore.com/4gb_patch.php)

You only need this if you have 4GB or more of RAM, 8 users).  Select the Morrowind.exe file and run the patch.

**EXE Optimizer**

[Download](http://timeslip.users.sourceforge.net/exeopt.html)

To extract this, 7, 8 users).  Click the ""Benchmarker"" tab and uncheck ""Benchmark patches"" (I've found this option to cause some errors).  Go back to the ""Main"" tab and select ""Find Morrowind manually"".  Navigate to your Morrowind folder and select it.  Then, click ""Patch Morrowind"".  When it's finished, exit the program.

**BTB's Morrowind Patch**

[Download](http://btb2.free.fr/morrowind.html)

Extract the contents of this archive into your Morrowind directory (in my case C:\Morrowind\).  Be sure to copy and replace any files that require overwriting.

Go back to the Morrowind directory

---

**(Optional) Tweak the Morrowind.ini file**

---

The Morrowind.ini is in your Morrowind base directory. * BE SURE TO MAKE A COPY OF THIS FIRST.* You can follow this guide's .ini settings if you wish:

[Morrowind Tweak Guide (highly outdated)](http://www.tweaktown.com/articles/316/the_elder_scrolls_iii_morrowind_tweak_guide/index5.html)

This is the system I play Morrowind on most
i5-3210M @ 2.5GHz
4GB DDR3 RAM
Intel HD4000 Integrated Graphics
Windows 7 x64

Here are some of the .ini tweaks that I use consistently

    Show FPS=1
    Max FPS=60
    Screen Shot Enable=1
    ThreadPriority=0
    Interior Cell Buffer=64
    Exterior Cell Buffer=128

    [LightAttenuation]
    UseConstant=1
    ConstantValue=0.382
    ;
    UseLinear=1
    LinearMethod=1
    LinearValue=0.15
    LinearRadiusMult=1.0
    ;
    UseQuadratic=1
    QuadraticMethod=2
    QuadraticValue=2.5
    QuadraticRadiusMult=1.15	
    ;
    OutQuadInLin=0
    
    [Weather Rain]
    Rain Diameter=1200
    Max Raindrops=1500
    
    [Weather Thunderstorm]
    Rain Diameter=1200
    Max Raindrops=3000
    
    [Weather Snow]
    Snow Diameter=1600
    Max Snowflakes=1500


... and that's about it.  I don't like to change anything else

---

**(Optional) In-Game Settings**

---

When in the game

*Prefs Tab*

* Always Use Best Attack: On (uses the weapon's best attack)

* AI Distance: Far (Shows NPC movement smoothly from a distance

*Video Tab*

* View Distance: Far (Lower if you have FPS problems.  This is highly FPS intensive)

* Gamma Correction: 35% (This goes well with my lighting settings in the INI section above)

*Controls Tab*

Customize your controls here.  I recommend setting Jump to spacebar or something and setting Activate to E (swap them). Jump is usually spacebar

---

**Run the game!**

---

Run the game using the FPS optimizer.  Click Launch Morrowind when you run it.  Enjoy!

Read up on the game.  Bookmark [UESP](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Morrowind).  You'll need it.  The levelling system is a bit wonky

---

**Changelog**

---

*1.0 - Initial version added to Reddit*

*1.1 - Replaced Unofficial Morrowind Patch with BTB's Patch and added FPS Optimizer additional info*

So I want to do a heavily researched play-through of Morrowind with more of a focus on individual towns

So my question is would you have any interest for this? I don't want to make it like a history lesson so the skill will be in picking and choosing facts that are interesting

I also want to mention that I want to include enough information so then people who have already played the game gain something from it. I will go down a very planned route of gameplay and not be too general in what I do. This is so then others who are inspired to play the game can go down their own completely different route.

Also has anyone else done something similar to this with Morrowind?

Thanks! =]

EDIT 1 - If you're going to downvote please tell me why

EDIT 2 - It seems a fair number of you would like this to happen! I can't actually find any videos of people playing through Morrowind and giving lots of information about aspects of the game either.

I am aware that some of these questions may have been asked before

1. Was Morrowind your first Elder Scrolls game? 

2. Was Morrowind your first RPG?

3. How did you discover Morrowind?

4. Do you still play the game (sporadically/frequently) or do you ""just"" wallow in memories?

5. Has Morrowind influenced the way you play other TES games? (Character is Dunmer, etc.)

6. What are your thoughts when you hear the Morrowind theme? Do you listen to it while reading

7. How has Morrowind influenced your life? Or didn't it have it any influence at all?

What I'd like to propose are some ideas to spice things up:

* Weekly challenges - Each week, and it seems like it could work here.

* Creative contests - Each week or so

* Mod contests - Every so often, or a part of the game to expand on (""create a backstory for Arlowe and the BanHammer""), and give people a certain, relatively short, time period to make a related mod. This might be less of a competition, and hopefully give some new guys a chance to get their feet wet.

A short while ago I posted a thread asking what people's favorite lesser known were. After reading over the thread and looking at all the great mods people recommended

---

###Graphical

##Morrowind Overhaul Sound and Graphics
This mod is best graphical mod for the game. It comes with the latest version of the Morrowind Patch Project and the Morrowind Code Patch. It also includes numerous graphical updates to the games meshes and textures and includes the Morrowind Graphics Extender. The Graphics Extender is very resource needy and the higher setting offered by this mod require a fairly powerful computer

##Westly's Pluginless Head Replacer
This pluginless head replacer made by Westly replaces the vanilla heads with updated one's that stay truer to the originals than those included in the overhaul. It does not replace the Imperial, then don't drag the the meshes and textures that apply to that race into your data files. The meshes and textures are all named in a manner that allows you to differentiate which ones apply to which race and gender which makes this much easier. Screenshots: http://img838.imageshack.us/img838/8104/picwestly1.jpg, http://img404.imageshack.us/img404/9708/picwestly2.jpg, http://img545.imageshack.us/img545/6937/picwestly3.jpg. Download here: http://www.moddb.com/games/morrowind/addons/westlys-pluginless-head-replacer.

##Poorly Placed Object Fix
The version of this mod included in the overhaul is messed up in certain areas. Download this version and extract the esm file from this version and replace the one included in the Overhaul with it. Download here: http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=Mods.Detail&amp;id=9197

---

###Bug Fixes/Gameplay Tweaks

##Delayed Dark Brotherhood Attacks
This mod makes the introduction of the Tribunal expansion much more realistic. No longer will a random prisoner be attacked by assassins in the dead of night. This mod delays the Dark Brotherhood's attacks on the player until he has gained much notoriety in the land of Morrowind either by being proclaimed Nerevarine or being made leader of a major guild or great house. Download here: http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=mods.detail&amp;id=2487

##Illy's Solstheim Rumor Fix
Normally everybody and their uncle knows about the island of Solstheim in Morrowind and every imperial has a son there. This can be slightly immersion breaking. This fixes that by making so

##Frostmoth Repaired
This mod repairs Fort Frostmoth as the Bloodmoon main quest progresses. Scaffolding and whatnot appear as the fort is rebuilt. It's a simple and great little mod that everybody should check out. Download here: http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=mods.detail&amp;id=4704

##Hospitality Papers
Hospitality Papers were supposed to be required to engage in any services in Sadrith Mora

##Protective Guards
The guards in Morrowind will bravely defend you against a rat

##Shut Up!
This mod makes it so that NPCs will only greet you if you look at them. You can now walk through the streets without being constantly yelled at. This mod requires the Morrowind Script Extender. The Morrowind Script Extender is built into MGE

##Arrow De-nocker
This plugin allows you to de-nock your arrow. TThis mod requires the Morrowind Script Extender. The Morrowind Script Extender is built into MGE

##Nastier Camonna Tong
This mod gives the Camonna Tong more insulting greetings. Racial slurs and all are included in this mod. When you download this mod makes sure to change the name of the ""sounds"" file to ""sound"" before you drag it's contents into your Data Files folder

##Oblivion Style Vampires
Excerpts from author's description: ""With this plugin you will progress through four stages of the disease, more fire damage, and upon reaching the fourth stage, NPCs will know you are a vampire, and react appropriately. Feeding on the living brings this back to the first stage. You will be able to do all story quests, barter, stay at inns, while being a vampire. Essentially makes vampires function like they do in Oblivion. Does not overpower. Keeps the original balance (at their most powerful in my mod

##Random Passive Cliffracers
Few can deny that cliffracers are the most annoying creatures in Vvardenfell. They are not tough

##Galsiah's Character Development or MADD Leveler
These are two different mods that alter Morrowind's leveling system. **They are *not* compatible!** Both of these mods attempt to remove the min/maxing nature of Morrowind's leveling system, fatigue, and attributes directly. It also streamlines leveling by removing the level up menu altogether. By design this mod favors pure warriors, thieves, and mages. Mixed classes suffer during GCD's use. MADD Leveler (my favorite of the two) improves Morrowind's leveling system by making all the level up bonus abilities to x1 (rather than x5 regardless of skill point gains), and gives you an attribute point every time you raise three skills controlled by that attribute. The mod also contains numerous addons that remove the skill cap among other things. More detailed descriptions of both mods can be found in their respective readmes. I recommend MADD over GCD, but you should investigate both

##Talrivian's State-Based HP Mod
They Morrowind normally calculates health forces the player to beef up their endurance in the beginning regardless of class. With this mod installed the health now is equal to ( (Strength + Endurance) / 2 ) + ( ( Endurance / 10 ) x ( Level - 1 ) ). This means that fortify endurance potions are now useful

###Part 2 [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Morrowind/comments/1dpm4h/morrowind_modding_guide_part_2/)

----

###Make sure to read all readme's before installing any of the above mods. All are compatible with each other. Be sure to run the Mlox utility included in the Morrowind Overhaul to ensure that the mods are sorted into the proper order. It is recommended that these be used on a new game. Some of them may work on an old game

The basic idea is to create a new character

**Detailed rundown of the challenge:**

1. Begin by creating a new character. You can't take anything from the Seyda Neen Census and Excise offices apart from the package and the 87 gold Sellus Gravius gives you. Teleport to Ghostgate immediately after exiting the offices. The console command for teleporting there is

        coc ""Ghostgate

 If you for some reason can't or don't want to use the console

 I suggest you make a manual save here in case you want to retry the challenge with a different character. You can use the console command

        enablestatreviewmenu

 to effectively create a new character. This way you won't have to work your way through the tutorial again and again.

2. Once at Ghostgate

3. Once you feel like you're done with your preparations, you're free to enter any location *inside* the Ghostfence, so if you for example feel like grabbing Sunder or Keening, you can go right ahead.

4. Your first goal is to reach the ""secret"" entrance to Kogoruhn located northwest of Dagoth Ur. Feel free to look it up on a [map](http://www.uesp.net/maps/mwmap/mwmap.shtml?locx=25088&amp;locy=78976&amp;zoom=15) before you begin.

5. Upon entering Kogoruhn

6. Your ultimate goal now is to reach the (relative) safety of Kogoruhn's top level (roof). Whereas the creatures in the Red Mountain region level with you

7. If you do manage to finally reach the roof

**(TL;DR)** And there you have it. Simple as that. Create a new character

**But Eventt

Being the good sport that I am

**One final note:** During my own successful attempt

So

 * 4 Ash Slaves
 * 4 Blighted rats
 * 3 Corprus Stalkers
 * **18 cliff racers**

You can move the heart of lorkhan to any mage's guild by bringing a guild guide to the heart, and it will ""follow"" you through the teleport, like anything else you can escort. You can do this at any time, even before you start the main quest, without breaking the main quest.

Just how much do enemies scale with your level in Morrowind? To test this

The route starts and ends inside Ghostgate

**The results:**

**Test subject 1:** [Morra](http://i.imgur.com/RXIu7rP.jpg)

 * 7 Rats

 * 9 Corprus Stalkers

 * 4 Ash Slaves

 * 2 Scamps

 * 1 Mudcrab and

 * 17 Cliff Racers.

40 creatures all in all. Quite a lot for a level 1 character

**Test subject 2:** [Rathir](http://i.imgur.com/IhXtTHo.jpg)

 * 3 Corprus Stalkers

 * 4 Ash Slaves

 * 1 Mudcrab

 * 19 Cliff Racers

 * 3 Lame Corpruses

 * 4 Ash Zombies

 * 1 Shalk

 * 8 Ash Ghouls

 * 3 Ogrim Titans

 * 3 Hungers

 * 1 Clannfear

 * 1 Flame Atronach

 * 1 Dremora

 * 1 Daedroth and finally

 * 4 Ascended Sleepers.

57 creatures

And there we have it. The enemies actually scale quite a bit with the PC's level, Oblivion, but I'm still personally opposed to it. I just don't like it. At all.

He's perfectly civil when you first meet him. I mean he was your friend once upon a time. 

He doesn't speak in the large ham stereotypically evil and twisted voice. His goal isn't total destruction of the mortal plane like Mehrunes Dagon or Alduin. He's simply a person driven mad with his lust for power

The way he greets you when you go to confront him is somewhat disarming in how charming he seems. The way he gives you an honest choice to join him (even though there's no way to accept in the unmodded game).

I'd love to see that in more games - charismatically 'evil' antagonists

~Scaling and difficulty~

-  [Morrowloot](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19353) - This is the backbone to our installation

- [Deadly Combat](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5485) - makes stamina crucial to winning

-  [Frostfall](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11163) - An amazing addition, don't worry camping is very simple and warming up happens even easier than you would think. I like to save only when warm at a fire now, it's very much like Dark Souls and stops F5 abuse.

-  [ASIS-Encounter Zones](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18436) - yea I mentioned this mod earlier, like Bitter Coast &lt; Red Mountain.
  
-  [Mighty Magick](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13166/) - Mark and recall + good balancing for deadly combat.

-  [Harder Lockpicking](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7395) and [More Locked Containers](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9829) - Self explanatory.

~UI and immersion~

-  [SkyUI](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3863) - Well... Duh.

-  [Smaller ipHUD](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16178) - Morrowinds was smaller but you cant have everything.

-  [Compass Tuner](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/912) - Just shut down everything! Except cardinal points of course.

-  [Unique Region Names](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15125) - we all know Morrowinds

- [Better Quest Objectives](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11135) - Crucial

-  [The Choice is yours](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26359) - Screw your family heirlooms

-  [Book Paper HD](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1618) and [Lore Loading Screens](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21265) - For all us lore nuts.

-  [Alternative Start](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9557) - Major complaint is you're dubbed the hero right away

~World and ascetics~

-  [RCRN](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1875) - makes the world all foggy and mysterious (at least occasionally)

-  [Lanterns All in One](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18916) - Remember to pick an RCRN config!

- [Cart in Every Town](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8434) - Why walk when you can ride?

- [No NPC Greetings](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/746) - It was when a group of drunk angry Nords were glaring silently at my elve casually walking around I realized it was more than just an annoyance remover.

-  [Bards Sing on Request Only](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8842) OUR Hero
I TELL you
 
- [Improved Combat Sounds](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5289)

- [Realistic Ragdolls](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/601) - you fall at their feet like a sack of potatoes

- [Bigger Trees](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17168) - Looks magical just like the mushrooms

- Misc - [Better Snow](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10383) + [HD Texures](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/743)

~Conclusion~

Well that's it so far, a sense of mystery and several other things I can't quite recall at he moment. All of these growing from pretty fundamental gameplay mechanics, sadly not all will ever be modded in.

With all this in mind I chose these mods resembling the most pure experience while remaining light and still refraining from over saturation of conflicting plugins (I'm looking at you FCOM).

None of these Mods are mine, it's just that I would have loved to have read this if I were in your shoes.

If you want suggest other mods then I'll add them to the list

When i was younger, complete a quest, explore a dungeon, and much, much more. I had never seen any game like this before.

My Dad and I had played this game so much that we had races to see who can get to ____ level before the other one as at this time my Dad was Unemployed. He would tell me all he accomplished while i was at school.  

Soon enough we had gotten my uncle into the game. He had his own xbox and was also hardcore into the game like us. 
It was clear that this was our favourite game of all time.

_______________________________________________
Oblivion was released.

We didn't get it until a few years after it was released. Mainly because we didn't have enough money to buy a 360.

This is when my dad had stopped with TES games as he finally had gotten a job and wanted to be blown away with Oblivion as he did with Morrowind. But i continued with Morrowind. I had saved up money for the GoTY version and it sucked MORE hours out of my life with the two new lands to explore and more quests to complete.

When we finally got Oblivion my dad was like ""WOAH!"" and i was like ""WOAH!"".....for the first 2 days. It started going ""meh"" for me after a few days while for my dad it was still ""WOAH!"" I was not satisfied with Oblivion. I 
knew what i wanted

_______________________________________________
11.11.11 Skyrim is released

We had gotten it opening night.

My dad was BLOWN AWAY by it. While i thought it was great. But it gradually lost its enjoyment. It felt watered down and not as creative as Morrowind. It remains my dads favourite game of all time.



_______________________________________________
The point is

To this day Morrowind remains my 2ND favourite game of all time.


TL;DR I tell about memories i had playing Morrowind and how it has made an impact on me. Morrowind made me a gamer.

We all know there are ways to abuse skills, and every so often someone will come along and complain about how completely broken the game is because of this.  My first thought with this sort of thing is, then why do you do it?  OK, maybe a Dark Brotherhood assassin dropping strong armor at your feet at first level is a bit in-your-face and hard to ignore, but no one forces you to blast your Intelligence through the stratosphere and make super-potions or raid some Great House's vaults.

I've only ever done the Alchemy exploit to see it for myself

There's a similar issue in Skyrim, but I know I've never gotten close to that level.  Of course, I only use the skills when it makes sense to, so no mass production of enchanted iron daggers or anything for the express purpose of getting access to the ""broken"" abilities.

So I decided to finally get Morrowind to try it out and holy cow, there was an entire city in there O.o. I talked to some guy and he told me it was the shell of some ancient beast. just an example of how amazing and unique this game is compared to Skyrim where every city is made of the same farmhouses.

I love how there's no quest markers and you have to do your own research instead of following the damn arrow. After playing Morrowind

Apologies if this doesn't fit the sub-reddit, holy shit I wrote a lot more than I wanted to. Heads up!)

I wanted to share with you guys my third night on playing. I've been trying to get into Morrowind for years. I first received a copy of vanilla Morrowind many

Many years later and I got the sudden urge to install it again. I couldn't find my disc and so I picked up the GOTY edition and put some nice graphical enhancements in an attempt to keep my interest for more than 10 minutes this time.

Over the last few days

I've made a conscious effort to read each book I come across, a lot of background history on the house wars and particularly the redoran fights. The stories themselves have for some reason gripped me in a way I never thought they would. I'm not usually one for reading in-game text, nor am I one for killing a whole room of people so I can loot their books, but this time around I've caught myself doing just that a number of times.

--------------------------------------------

I've started playing a mage character, tonight I had my first encounter with cliff racers. I've been steadily progressing through the mage's guild questline for the last few days and after lollygagging around a lake collecting flowers for 3 hours (damn you stoneflowers!), I was dispatched to collect some fees from higher ranking members who hadn't paid up.

I headed out of Balmora and headed over the hill

Of course, pissing off every cliff racer in a 2 mile radius. 

I had barely any magic left and stumbled upon a Dunmer fortress/city. I levitated up to the top floor and tried my luck entering into some random room. I got lucky, completely drained of fatigue. My heart was racing and I quickly cased the barrels/chests before setting out again. (scored an ebony long sword, wuuuut!)

I stumbled upon the cave and unfortunately the quest contact wasn't helpful. She refused to pay

I exited the cave and returned to Balmora, and put it to good use. I was lucky enough to have a slow fall ring and with some lucky timing, flung myself over a few hills and slow falled right onto the Dunmer city again. I landed just shy of the roof and didn't have enough mana to levitate. Fuck. I had rats now chasing me and my fatigue was running low.

I made a break for that old cave I visited, rested back up and waited for the storm to pass.

I finally made it to the small bunker like building and completed the other half of the quest. I spent about 40 minutes extra just reading the stories about redoran and telvanni conflicts

--------------------------------------------

I apologize for the lengthy post but I thought maybe you guys would enjoy seeing how much fun I had

Anyone else have some great stories of when they started out? I'd love to hear them.

1340214240.0,vc6kx,Delving Into Morrowind: part #1,FetchFx,57,6,21,"**#0 Introduction**

So, but I never had any particular interest in it. I guess my taste in games has changed over the years, now that I'm eager to jump into a large RPG and explore the vastness, while when I was younger I settled for GTA-games and more linear games that guided you along its path (not to say that those games were or are bad, I still play that style of games as well).

After having played Skyrim for probably more than 300 hours, but thats what I get for going home during summer and leaving my things back at the apartment. So I'm playing the GOTY version of Morrowind on my Macbook, through a Cider wrap. It runs quite well, even with high resolution textures added. Now, enough intro.


**#1 Where am I

I started off, so I made a male with a young appearance.

Having never played any of the earlier Elder Scrolls games I opted for the option to answer questions to determine my class. Ended up a Rogue, where and how, I continued on for some time with small quests and exploring the city, exhausting the dialogue options of several main and minor characters. Lack of proper armor and weapons made me a bit of a thief on my first visit to Balmora. I stole a short silver blade (being proficient in the art), and a set of medium bonemold armor.


Now that I finally felt a bit more secure, though they posed no real threat going down quite quickly after a few jabs. Quickly thereafter I met my first cliff racer, the infamous flying lizards. A tough fight for a level one Rogue, but I managed.


Further on I entered a new town, it doesn't fit with my character).


Just outside the city, they still went down. After the fight I felt like resting until fully healed, but right after a Dark Brotherhood assassin attacked me out of nowhere. I died the first time, but the second time around I won just by a small margin. Having gained a new armor I felt pretty badass, but with my life now almost fully drained, I started to run back to Caldera. Just as I close in on the city a cliff racer descends upon me from above! Luckily a guard came running and took the bastard down while I recuperated at a nearby inn… Needless to say, it was an eventful day.

*Volanare is an Altmer who detests the lesser races. He has an affinity for the arcane arts, neither he nor the guards ever received an explanation of what exactly he did. He could not subjugate himself to life under the rule of men and took to any insubordination he could. Unfortunately, practicing magic in a way that would not result in further beatings and scrutiny was difficult, but he was able to stomach the idea of using his skills in alchemy to refine drugs the filthy cat he shared a cell with, who was known to locate certain things from time to time, in exchange for crude alchemy tools and ingredients.*

*Volanare found one way to misbehave which prevented the guards from touching him AND--better yet!--infuriated the prudish ash-skin in the cell across the hall. He slept, they neglected his very existence, and removed the Khajiiti swine he had lived with for months. As he starved for weeks, drinking only whatever dripped down from the ceiling of his cage he grew delusional. He came to realize his race was favored by the gods and that was the only reason he was alive. His starvation and the nonstop mocking from the daedra-worshiping Dreth character across the hall drove him to desperation. One day, nearly too hungry to move, he did the only thing he could think of doing and tried to cast a rudimentary Command spell on a guard to obtain a sweetroll. Unfortunately, in his delirium, they forced peasant's clothes onto him and sent him to the increasingly diseased island of Vvardenfell. If his schizophrenic ramblings somehow didn't get him killed by the locals,,

I tried to get one of the Mages Guild quest, I reached Fort Moonmoth and continued as the guide said. Somehow I got lost in the mountains, still quicksaving, easy enemies so far, so everything was ok. 

After I fought off two pterodactyles (cliff runners) I entered some dungeon near. It seemed quite and I entered the door to shrine. There was ugliest monster I ever encountered in the game
It kept sending some kind of a spell but it was not attacking. So I killed it
After a while I realized my strength is reduced to zero

I looked up that the monster was sending Drain Atribute spell and it should wear off after a while. So I waited for half a day, still nothing.
After a third day, gained cool armor, healed and waited for bit more. Another assasin, fought him off just as easily. Level up!
I raised strength by 3 points

I could only wear a dagger and 55 coins, but Guard heard my story about assasins. After a while I found the correct shrine in temple (its on top level) and restored my attributes for 35 gold. Yepee! I didnt have to load old save.

Now to get my stuff back. And run from that cursed place.

**Quality**

Think about this, either altering the challenge itself, coming up with fun restrictions or removing unnecessary ones, etc... Also, coming up with a new one each week month after month just seems impossible. It's been good so far, but it's new, can we keep it up for the next year? Or if the mods don't want to post one for the next month

**Competition**

This is probably more important in my view. With more time, or completed with more gold, or whatever the goal is. Then there could be a back and forth. If more videos are submitted, the execution of the challenge will be refined and there could be some real competition that would be tons of fun. Maybe some prizes and flare of some sort for winners. Maybe we could start a fund for a the last competition of the year and have a big one every year and the winner could get some cash. I'd throw in ten bucks. This could be a great way to make things exciting and grow the community.

Okay.. So I just recently Started up Morrowind (I'm about 20 hours in) after playing Skyrim for 450 hours. I figured it was about time to see what the game was about. I tell you I am not at all displeased. This game feels much deeper than Skyrim in a way I wished they kept around.. But onto the story.

So I've met the Blades guy in Balmora and done a couple things for him.. But what really interests me at this time is the Mage's Guild. I like the people in there and the quests they send me. Especially the Khajiit. (But why does the Dark Elf Steward want to kill everyone? Beats me). So I do a lot of quests for these two people (Without killing anyone if I can help it. I major in Speechcraft) and get to a point where the only quests that are left is from the Khajiit if I get Warlock.

So.. That's what I do. I am now a Warlock of the Mage's Guild. I talk to my Khajiit pal and she tells me that the almighty Staff of Magnus is here. Any Skyrim references are big with me but this one takes the cake.. (Other than Jiub

So I go to check the Strider guy and he doesn't have an option to go to Molag Mal.. Fine I know where some road signs are from my quest at Arkngthand. So I go.. And I follow these road signs.. which point northeast from Balmora. Northeast.. from Balmora. So I'm going and fighting because there's a lot of monsters on the roads. The Ashlands kinda creep me out

I'm doing everything in my power to make it, some scrolls, I'm resting everywhere I possibly can.. But I just can't do it. Why? Because CLIFF RACERS do not give one FUCK about how fast I can jump. They follow me until the ends of the earth and destroy me because I can cast about 6 kill spells before I'm out of Magicka. You cannot avoid these creatures. So after several wipes failing to make it I use a Divine Intervention. Okay I'm back at Moonmoth, time to try something different.

Okay so I noticed I was getting pretty close to the east portion of the map, can't remember. But I can remember Arkngthand alright.) 

Well Obviously I can't swim back to the shore from there

So take 2, using my jump spell to great glee. I'm not in the Ashlands yet so not as many CLIFF RACERS.. But I do find the odd worm that I kill in one shot from my Fire Hands spell (Custom Crafted). I happen upon some bandits on the side of the road, they are handily dispatched. Then i get to the Ashlands and finally see a road sign that says Molag Mal. 

So I head out now going ever southward towards Molag Mal. As I enter the Ashlands proper, but I save a lot.. and I have to kill stuff every now and then. Well I get to Northeast of Balmora, and I still have to go south.. Which angers me a little but that's okay, I must be almost there, I've been following signs forever. Nope.

The road to Molag Mal is windy, and I'm running from monsters, and jumping from monsters, and killing CLIFF RACERS because I have no other choice. As I'm running from some biggish thing, I find a temple that I know probably has two funny stones in it. I've been to one of these before, so I go up and into the two stone room to rest from the monster. I come out with full magicka and one shot it. (Most of my problems come from me having not enough Magicka). 

Okay

I head straight east from the temple

And as soon as I get to Molag Mal.. I see a strider guy.. but I can't be mad.. I don't have time to.. I'm running from a bug thing. I've tried to fight one of these bug things before.. and it kills me in two hits.. and it's just as fast as I am.

I get up to the strider and it says I can go to Vivec. At this point I facepalm.. because I've been to Vivec before.. I just didn't remember that Molag Mal was an option from there.

Anyway, one that I think is quest related. But the Staff of Magnus is mine.. and I leveled up 2 times on this adventure.


TLDR: Walked from Vos to Molag Mal because I didn't know I could use a Strider to get there... All for the Staff of Magnus

1360347570.0,1856ui,A few tips for navigating in Morrowind without the (mini)map,Eventt,45,7,11,"**The Sun**

The Sun rises in the east at approximately 6 a.m. ([screenshot](http://imgur.com/a/t9BKW#0))

From there it will start gradually moving towards the west where it will set at approximately 7 p.m. ([screenshot](http://imgur.com/a/t9BKW#1))

It will be directly south of your location at exactly 1 p.m.

**Ash storms**

The ash always blows away from the crater of Red Mountain. For example

**The stars**

Navigating by the stars isn't quite as simple as the previous two methods and will obviously work only if the night sky is clear enough. 

The steps:

**1) Look straight up** and you will see something like [this](http://imgur.com/a/t9BKW#3). In the screenshot you'll notice a bright triple star (circled) about halfway between the crosshair and the bottom of the picture.

**2) Move your crosshair directly on top of the triple star**. ([screenshot](http://imgur.com/a/t9BKW#4))

You are now facing either north, it will be Day 2 (after midnight) and so forth.

**3) Divide the number of the current day by 4**. The direction you're facing is determined by the remainder:

Remainder 0 (divisible by 4): You're facing west.

Remainder 1: North

Remainder 2 (even but not divisible by 4): East

Remainder 3: South

Remember: The number being divided here is the number of the day *beginning at midnight*. Therefore, you'd be facing east using this method).

Another example: It's 1 a.m. on Day 205. Because 205 = 51 * 4 + **1**

On my way to Balmora I met a man who wanted me to find his friend
Finally arriving in Balmora I finished several small contracts for the Fighters Guild until I got to a mission where I had to get back a book (by any means) from a Thieves Guild member. Having dabbled in speechcraft I though I'd might flatter her until she gave it up. Unfortunately I had joined them earlier, taunting until zero, bribing her up again and then continue to taunt. In the end she snapped and attacked, at which point I could kill her without penalty. I got the book back and avoided killing her in ""cold blood"", thus also avoiding getting tossed out of the Thieves Guild.
After some more affairs in Balmora (among getting a dwemer box for some information, and I soon learned it's purpose and history from the inhabitants of the two guard towers at the gate.
To my excitement I found a smith and armor salesman in the basement of one of the towers, glass armor. Except for greaves he sold the rest, but it was far to expensive for me. My stealth skills were (and for that matter are) almost as low as possible, so stealing was out of the picture. Then I remembered how I taunted the Thieves Guild member. I tried the same on the smith and lets just say that I now have several glass swords and an almost full set of glass armor. I look quite extravagant.

After this little moral break I started on the return trip to Caldera. I now had a full inventory and went back to sell it all to a small creature with lots of gold that lives in some Orc Manor
Wanting to join more guilds and experience Morrowind at it's fullest, joined with them, and quickly noticed their neighbors, The Morag Tong. I love the role of the assassin, so I wanted to join them as well. But to do so I have to go to Vivec and talk with their leader. I went there but I haven't found him… the search goes on.

I also miss having to ask around and looking for people and places.  Morrowind forced you to explore each town and city by not having markers to tell you where to go.  Having to actually find Caius Cosades in Balmora was such an amazing experience the first time I played.

I think Morrowind fans sometimes come off as elitist, though sometimes we want to see those qualities that made Morrowind so amazing re-introduced into subsequent titles. To see a game that re-captures the bizarre &amp; alien cultures and landscapes of Vvardenfell, peopled with morally ambiguous Gods and demi-gods, where a pitiful welp fresh off the boat can ascend to apotheosis and slay deities if they so wish in the depths of their elaborate temples.

So many memories brought rushing back into my mind. The words ""The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind"" transition onto the screen, yet so familiar. A long-awaited hero walks among his people, unknown to them. Whether it's the humble abodes in the port town of Seyda Neen, the bridges and balconies of Vivec city, down to the dark caves that mar the land, where every sound is cause for alarm, and a shout can cause a minor heart attack. The Nerevar's presence is felt among the hearts of the Tribunal

I am unaware of this, an opportunity I will not find for years to come. Pausing to listen as sounds that seem almost perfectly crafted for this moment are played, and I make sure to appreciate every moment. Every character is individual, and simply by reading, I could tell you the personality of everyone in any town.

Morrowind was the first Elder Scrolls game I was introduced to, and to write correctly. I feel that its music may have inspired me to learn music later on, and I know that it - and consequent instalments - inspired me to keep going. It helped with my development as a person, to spend time with lots of different people who look different than me, but are the same inside. Skyrim inspired me to start cooking properly, and I would never have played it if not for Morrowind. No one thing has had more of an impact on my life than this game, subtly influencing my life in minor ways that have changed time like a butterfly's wings. I would never have taken up an interest in gaming

There is so much more that I could write, for if he had not, I wouldn't have discovered such an amazing world, that has had an affect on how I live in this one.

I installed it on my PC about 2 years ago and messed around a little bit here and there but never got into it like I did back in the day.  It's basically just been sitting dormant on my hard drive all this time.  For some reason the idea recently popped into my head to start playing again

1369153891.0,1ersnf,Another Morrowind challenge: The Racer Race,Eventt,37,6,19,"Challenges are fun, however

The challenge is quite simple. After creating a new character

I have completed the race myself with an Argonian Monk called Morra. I'll be using screenshots taken during his run to help illustrate how exactly this whole thing works.

It's not nearly as complicated as the amount of text below might lead you to believe. I'm just trying to be as specific as possible to avoid any misunderstandings.

**Details and rules:**

1. Begin by creating a new character. Don't take anything from Seyda Neen apart from Fargoth's ring and the stuff Sellus Gravius gives you. Once you're out of the Census and Excise offices

        coc ""Shrine of Azura""

 You should now be standing inside the Shrine with your inventory looking something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/aAaSZ8d.png).

2. When you're ready

        show dayspassed
        show gamehour

 After entering the commands

3. Run to Ghostgate. You're *not* allowed to talk to anyone nor to use any equipment, Recall) and levitation are not allowed as are other methods of fast travel (silt striders, guild guides etc.).

 If you die during the race

4. Once you've made it to Ghostgate, the race is over and it's time to stop the clock by opening the console and entering the very same console commands as before:

        show dayspassed
        show gamehour

 Now take a screenshot of the console once again. The result should look [something like this](http://i.imgur.com/qxamkWN.jpg). Congratulations! You've completed the race!

5. Now that the race is over and we have screenshots from both the start and the finish, I finished the race at   (day/hour) 2/3.6105, and started at 1/9.8401, making my total time **17.7704 hours**. If you don't want to do the math, leave it to me and/or the rest of us. Linking the screenshots is enough.

**TL;DR:** Run from the Shrine of Azura to Ghostgate without dying. Post screenshots from the start and the finish with the time stamps described above to show how long it took you.

**Notes:**

 * Again, so pausing the game won't have any effect on your result.

 * Resting is allowed. However, so I'll probably come last in this race.

 * Disabling Tribunal [might be a good idea.](http://i.imgur.com/DZPXMzR.jpg)

 * What route you want to use is completely up to you. If you absolutely must go and visit the Urshilaku Ashlanders during the race

 * Again, the clock only starts ticking once you take the first screenshot and start running, so there's no need to rush through the tutorial as fast as you can.

 * Given that you can freely choose your route, caused by cliff racers.

 * The reason why we're using the console to measure the time instead of the wait/rest window is because the numbers given by the console allow for much more precise measurements. No one likes ties when they're caused by imprecise measurement methods.

 * I originally got the idea for a race from.. [Someone.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Morrowind/comments/1egf2t/the_red_mountain_run/ca00ky3) It looks like the account's since been deleted

Vvardenfell has many places, and don't muddle too much in the affairs of the Dunmer, you're welcome on the island.  


The dead seem to be lacking in the equal opportunity that the living are afforded.  In my exploration of Vvardenfell, out of the open, but we don't know where they end up.  For all we know, they're thrown in the bushes somewhere, or off of a cliff.


 I can accept that some may not receive--or deserve-- burial.  Barbarians, their corpses left to be devoured by some beast or to rot in the dirt.  Bandits and smugglers, whether slain by a do-gooder adventurer or betrayed by their own kind, may end up face-down on the floor of a cave.  Animals, of course, live and die in the wild (even the beloved pack guar).  


But what about the humble townsperson? The intrepid adventurer?  I'm talking about YOU


All men and mer who are respectable in life should have some sort of respect given to them when they die!

The story was definitely the best Main Quest story of the three games I've played and the sheer variety of weapons and spells is  phenomenal. I love levitate especially. Also

 Before playing this game

I bring up Pokémon to bring up the parallel that when I play the latter parts of the game I cannot help but wonder how helpless someone would be if they started off in one of the towns you go to near the end of the game.

###Game Additions

##Bethesda's Official Plugins
The official plugins made by Bethesda are highly recommended for any Morrowind player. The LeFemm and Bitter Coast sounds I do not recommend you use with the overhaul. If you are prompted to replace a mesh or texture when installing these mods do **not** overwrite them. If you do

##Tamriel Rebuilt
Vanilla Morrowind does not include the entirety of the province of Morrowind, armor, weapons, clothes, regions, and quests to the game. It has been years in development and can be considered a 3rd and 4th expansion to Morrowind. This mod is highly recommended. Download here: http://www.moddb.com/mods/tamriel-rebuilt1.

##Signposts Retextured
The Morrowind Overhaul already covers the upgrading of the games signposts

##Less Generic NPCs
The Less Generic NPC mods add unique dialogue to NPC's and adds numerous new quests. The mod fits into the game perfectly and adds new depth to the game. Download here: http://lgnpc.org/downloads.

##Less Generic Nerevarine
These mods make the characters in the main quests of Morrowind and its expansions less generic and makes them much more fun. This mod made by one of the developers of the Less Generic NPCs mod. Download here: http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=User.EntriesListing&amp;id=37364.

##Antares Big Mod
This mod is hard to explain so I'll give the author's description: ""With this mod you have special privileges with the lower ranking members of your faction. You can:

-promote them
-teach spells to them and be paid for it
-teach disciplines to them and be paid for it
-reward them
-expel them from the faction.

Moreover
-the Guild of Mages and House Telvanni members can be sent on mission to collect ingredients for you;
-the Imperial Cult members may collect alms for you
-the Scouts can take you to every place in Vvardenfell;
-the Alchemists and Apothecaries may prepare potions by request;
-the Smiths may forge weapons and armor by request;
-the Agents provide you several services;
-the Assassins and Morag Tong members can be hired to execute a target;
-the Thieves Guild members can be hired to steal items from the NPCs;
-in the Guild of Fighters
-as member of the Imperial Legion
-as Patriarch of the Temple
-as House Father or Mouth of a House

Generally

Download here: http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?id=5892&amp;view=Mods.Detail

##Antares Little Mods
These mods are a set of small plugins by Antares (obviously). These include the addition of enchanting scrolls and more restocking soul gems and vendors, and most are worth checking out. Note that they are all individual plugins, so you can pick and choose what you want. I personally use The Doors, Living Statues of Malacath, and Scrolls and Soulgems plugin. Download here: http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=mods.detail&amp;id=6175

##Main Quest Enhancers
This mod makes the main quest much more immersive. The effects of Dagoth's increasing power are more visible and the quest is given a sense of urgency. This mod is modular meaning that you can pick and choose what you do and do not want this mod to do. Download here: http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=Mods.Detail&amp;id=9407

##Westly's Master Headpack
This mod vastly increases the number of choices one has for heads and hairs during character creation. This mod is great for getting the ideal look for your character. Download here: http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=mods.detail&amp;id=6173###Game Additions (Continued)

##Exquisite Robes
This mod adds re-textures versions of the ugly pink and yellow exquisite robe to different clothiers. The re-texture's are high quality and are highly recommend for anybody playing a mage character. Download here: http://mw.modhistory.com/download--7188

##Portcullises for Imperial Forts
The imperial forts in Morrowind were quite lacking in terms of defenses. These mods add portcullises to the imperial forts. Download here: http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=User.EntriesListing&amp;id=13738

##TwoThreeZero's Mannaz Manor
This house mod made by TwoThreeZero adds an extensive manor built in the Hlaalu style to the Ascadian Isles Region. The house is well made and contains lots of storage space for all of you hoarders out there. There are some issues with statics form Vurt/Vality's Ascadian Isles mod however

##Uvirith's Legacy/Building Up Uvirith's Legacy
These mods greatly expands the House Telvanni Stronhold of Tel Uvirith. Uvirith's Legacy expands the interior of the stronghold and adds numerous new quests along with some nice new items and a few companions. It also adds teleporters to all of the Telvanni strongholds and the council house. Building Up Uvirith's Legacy is a modified version of Building Up Uvirith's Grave that makes it compatible with Uvirth's Legacy. The mod allows you to expand your stronghold into a town. Both are great mods

---

###Make sure to read all readme's before installing any of the above mods. All are compatible with each other. Be sure to run the Mlox utility included in the Morrowind Overhaul to ensure that the mods are sorted into the proper order. It is recommended that these be used on a new game. Some of them may work on old game

In my opinion one of the more immersion breaking elements in Morrowind is the in-game map and the minimap

What I wanted to see is whether you can find your way the world and its quests without either map

It really makes you feel like you're exploring when you have to check the position of the sun to get your direction while you try to remember where you came from and look for clues to figure out your position. 

Nights actually make a difference as do sandstorms. It increases the immersion by a magnitude when you're lost in the Ashlands and you have to wait for the storm to pass to get any idea as to where you are and which way to go

Anyone who wants a different experience and isn't afraid to get lost should try it and remember: the sun rises from the east!

(I've included [here](http://users.utu.fi/aovtam/temp/AngsMods.zip) the mods I've made if anyone wants them, and another that adds a shitty ingame paper map for your inconvenience. You have to manually hide the world map by clicking the minimap while in inventory mode.)

From the gang called N’wahs With Attitudes 

When I wanted to kill a Redoran mo’fo
Motherfucking Morag Tong beat me to it

Eno Hlaalu
The Ordinators are gonna hafta come 'n' get me 

Off yo ass
For the Redoran councillor that I never killed

Cliff racers start to mumble
Heard about it in Bruma

Goin off on cliff racers like that 
with a long blade that's pointed at their ass

So give it up smooth 
Ain't no tellin when I'm down for a s’wit move 
with a crime record like da Dark Brothahood

Slit striders are the motherfucking tool 
Never ridin’ them looking like a fool

I can train you Hand to Hand
I'm knockin racers out tha nest
yo weekly
until them dumb motherfuckers can see
ain’t no one joking with Ice Jiub or Eazy V.

Cliff racers you can't fuck with me
 So when I'm in your neighborhood
you better duck 
Coz Ice Jiub is crazy as fuck 
As I leave
but when I come back

[Eazy V] Yo Fyr 
[MC Fyr] Whassup? 
[Eazy V] Tell em where you from!

Straight outta Tel Fyr
More corprus I smoke

I'm a bad motherfucker and you know this 
But the Sixth House don't show this

But I don't give a fuck
If not from the records

Heal a Nerevarine in a minute 
I find a good piece of the divine disease I go up in it
So if you're in the Corprusarium in the front row 
I'm a call Yagruf Bagarn on your ass for sho’.

A crazy muthafucker from da house Telvanni
 4000 years old still fucking with your mommy
Attitude legit cause I’m controlling the Blight 
For any dumb ash zombie that is starting a fight

Ash storms takin place without a clue

I'ma making Molag Bal think I love her

I see a motherfuckin daedric prince I don't dodge him 
But I'm smart
And when I see a Nerevarine

To me it's kinda funny
While the Tribunal Temple and da High Fane are just rollin 
lookin for the one they call Eazy V 
But here's a flash

Ruthless! Never seen like a dunmer woman with a dagga' 
Chilling in my temple to invite anotha N’wah 
except when I unload my Muatra without hesitation 
and hear the scream of the one who got the penetration

So what about Sheogorath throwin Baar Dau? Fuck him! 
You think I give a damn about a moon? 
I’ma throw your own ass in the ministry prison soon!

I have seen a few posts on r/Morrowind regarding Morrowind Mods that completely overhaul graphics and bring this classic up to par with newer releases. I've taken some time to install all the major overhauls, and [Morrowind 2011](http://morrowind2011.ultimaaiera.com/). 

Morrowind Graphic and Sound Overhaul was the first that I had tried. Be ready for a long install (Over an hour)! I messed up even with the video. I chalk it up to being my first install. I got it going on the third try

===================================

**MORROBLIVION**

The installation time on Morroblivion was longer because of the need to install Morrowind, Oblivion, all expansions, and updates before you can start the Morroblivion install. 

I found the installation of this pack to be the easiest of the three because you don't have to configure statics and land textures

The game is great and they did and awesome job porting everything. You start the game in Cyrodill and once you leave the sewers you see a ""World Transport Guide"" who offers to ship you to Vvardenfell where your adventure begins. These guides are throughout the game so you can go back and forth between continents. Morrowind with the advantage of fast-travel.

==============================

**Morrowind 2011**

Morrowind 2011 was a somewhat advanced install. I highly recommend finding the most up to date installation guide. The one I found in the install pack was older than the one on the website. Also, something about the UAC causes the game to not work correctly.

Following the guide step by step, Google finds it easy enough.

What made me decide to continue playing Morrowind 2011 over Morroblivion was the game interface. In Morroblivion, and alchemy :(  On the plus side, it's Oblivions' combat engine. It wasn't enough for me to stay though.

Morrowind 2011 was what I was looking for

TL;DR - I have Morrowind 2011 and Morroblivion installed

•	Steal from a vault: You must steal any amount of items to accumulate 5000+ bounty from a single vault. You MUST plant an opposing helmet to receive any points.

o	10 points for each vault


•	Kill a council member/grand master: You must kill this member using physical weapons. You MUST plant an opposing helmet to receive any points.

o	10 points for each council member

o	30 points for each grandmaster


•	Planting different helmets: You will receive points for each variety of guard helmet you plant on a body/vault. REMEMBER: you must plant a helmet from an opposing house (a Hlaalu guard helmet beside a Telvanni member). You will only receive the following points ONCE (planting multiple Hlalu guard helmets on multiple bodies will only yield 5 points)

o	5 points for a Hlaalu guard helmet

o	10 points for a Redoran guard helmet

o	15 points for a Telvanni guard helmet


So following the above scoring criteria

•	30 points for using each type of helmet

•	30 points for stealing from each vault

•	90 points for killing all grandmasters

•	150 points for killing all council members


The following rules must be followed for the challenge.

•	You may not use any kind of magic, or magic items. The game must be set to (0) difficulty.

•	The exception is flin. You may drink as much flin as needed 

•	You may not steal any items from anywhere (except from the vault) unless they are house helmets

•	You may not use any weapons or armor you find. The only weapons and armor you can use MUST be bought from Arielle

•	You may return Fargoths ring so buying items from Arielle is cheaper.

•	You may not do any quests while you are doing this challenge. 

•	From the stolen items from the Vault

•	If you are confronted by a guard

•	All items from the census office (Yes, clothing, arrows, flins, lockpicks, probes, and repair hammers. 

•	You may use the money to rent rooms to heal your health

•	You may use what money you have left over to use a travel service.

At an intersection I encounter a scantily clad Northman hailing from Whiterun (which I found quite amusing). He had supposedly had all his belongings stolen by a witch, so she paralyzed him and took his gear as punishment. She sounded more honest

After this I decided to return to Balmora to continue the main story and join some guilds. They were greatly beneficial in Skyrim, killing some rats. Easy stuff, but that was expected from the very first mission.

I suddenly felt like exploring and perhaps finish the Dark Brotherhood quest. My journal told me to speak to a guard, then being teleported by some lady to Mournhold. I was a bit bewildered after that ride, treading carefully around in this entirely new place. What monsters would I encounter, who could I trust? I decided to just follow the Journal and be guided, telling myself that if I died I'd just come at a later time.

I was further guided to Mournholds Great Bazaar. There I was told that the Dark Brotherhood was rumored to hold up in the old sewers under the Bazaar. After a little searching I found a trapdoor that led me down. Once there I continued very carefully
The tunnels of the sewer went several ways, I was in the Dark Brotherhoods layer. The place was crawling with assassins, and I often had to defend myself against two at a time. If it hadn't been for my shied, I would probably have had a tougher time with them. Now, my mission was to kill their leader, Dandras Vules. I had no idea of where to find him though, and probably went through twelve or more assassins before finally finding him. Before this I had finally gained my first level, but he was a lot tougher that anything I had expected to encounter. He conjured a bow and quickly dealt with me.
Feeling a bit flustered, though only after taking a health potion halfway into the fight. More armor and weapons for me. Especially his main blade, a poisonous short blade with high hit points.

Returning to the Bazaar I saw a stage and some audience standing around. A play was supposed to happen soon, and I was given only two minutes to remember my lines. I skimmed the book, noticing the important facts, and told the quest-giver I was ready. He sent me out on stage (an open stage, entered through a door in the back). There I recited some lines until, to my astonishment, one of the audiences attacked me. I quickly drew my newfound sword, and was quickly pounded into a dead pile of meat. Bloody assassin got me. The next time around I bought some potions beforehand, a Morag Tong assassin to be exact. He paid me handsomely though
Afterwards I started selling off all the Dark Brotherhood armor I had gathered. Having mercantile as a major skills helps greatly when you start charging for several hundred more gold that the buyer initially offers. I sold armor to vendors until I had to return to Ebonheart (after closing the book on the Dark Brotherhood quest) to be able to sell more. And now I have over ten thousand in gold. I do feel a bit lucky.

I'll be updating this post with Arcesso's journal entries for any of you that might be interested in following. I'm pretty excited about this.

***
**The Journal of Arcesso Equitus**

**Entry #1**

Today I was given an old and musty journal by one of the guards. I believe the gift was out of 

contempt and sarcasm more than kindness

since my cell mate and I were loaded onto this vessel with promises of freedom. The only 

thing helping me maintain sanity is the company of Jiub and the stewing compulsion for revenge 

for my unnecessary imprisonment. I've never met the individuals responsible

years to collect information regarding the scandalous ethical misstep that has stolen my life 

away. I have their accursed names

tongue as I lie awake every night. It feels as though a storm is brewing. I'm going to try to 

lie down.

***
**Entry #2**

What fortune! I awoke after a heavy night's sleep to my delight and surprise that I've reached 

my destination. We've harbored at a small island in Morrowind. Vvardenfell is calling my name. 

Certainly it is no coincidence that all of the people of importance to my mission are rumored 

to reside here. Strings are surely being pulled

***
**Entry #3**

After leaving the boat I had to go through the tedious task of registering as a citizen. It 

seems my roots have not wholly been pulled

census office when eyes were averted. Perhaps years of prison has not rid me of my thieving 

ways.

***
**Entry #4**

There will be no pleasure for me

with the citizens of Seyda Neen

caravaneer for a ride to Balmora in a Silt Strider. These lanky creatures are commonplace

yet their disturbing existence would still nauseate me were I to dwell on it. I have a feeling 

I'm going to be spending a lot of time inside these wretched beasts. I'm thankful

for the opportunity to relish in the pleasure of resting as a free man.

***
**Entry #5**

I woke up as the Silt Strider reached its destination of Balmura this evening. The ride was 

surprisingly short at only a few hours. I didn't know what to do in Balmura

a town I was vaguely familiar with. My father had told me all about it from when he was a 

traveler. I knew mostly of the Guild of Mages. I was fortunate enough to have an acquaintance 

in prison that taught me rudimentary spellcasting. Hopefully a demonstration will be enough to 

convince the guild to allow me entrance.

***
**Entry #6**

The Guild of Mages welcomed me with open arms. I had a few of the members teach me spells I 

might find necessary later in my journey. I have trouble casting them

practice it will become more consistent. The primary reason I joined the Guild was for the 

convenience of guild-to-guild travel. I had a Guild Member teleport me to a nearby town

Caldera. It was comforting to see the architecture and culture of an Imperial city. It 

reminded me of home

homesickness knows no bounds. This town truly is wonderful. I'm going to ask around

bearings

***
**Entry #7**

I spoke to some of the Guild Members here and acquired a few helpful spells. A local trader 

had some items I was eager to purchase. The most noteworthy being an Amulet of Recall. It will 

allow me to be transported to a previously chosen location instantaneously! Now I need to find 

a Mark spell or scroll. I found a manor that housed a troupe of Orcs. Despite their 

friendliness

discomforting. My father told me a lot of stories about what Orcs are capable of

individuals seem decent enough. They have a friend(?) that is goblinesque in appearance. He 

was stingy with his words

me and payed very hefty prices for everything I would present to him! The group of Orcs 

residing here seem to be very accepting of company. I was able to use a bedroll in their 

possession. Tonight I sleep with a full belly and an even fuller purse!

***
**Entry #8**

In the past months I've been in and out of jail several times. Some things don't ever change

it seems. I must have offended someone

recent weeks to an amateur assassin failing to perform. I was able to defend myself adequately 

on all attempts. I suspect this might have something to do with my release from prison and the 

reputation of those that put me there in the first place. I've spent many days and nights 

preparing for my goal. I've managed to put food into my mouth and hire personal trainers by 

means of treachery and thievery. I would go so far as to suppose that I am proof of the 

inadequacies of Morrowind's justice system. Prison neither rehabilitated me nor showed me the 

error of my ways. It only allowed my injustices to stew within

I've prepared myself physically

their wisdom and teachings. Physical skill alone certainly will not be enough to rectify my 

wrongs. I will find these villains like a hawk stalking its prey from afar. I will approach 

them as a shadow

sinners and His opposition. Retribution approaches the guilty and it will soon be realized.

**--- Release Info ---**

Spanning the heartland of Markarth County, his authority constantly checked by the fierce and defiant Bear Clan. Those brave enough to stray off the beaten path might find a warmer welcome at the secluded hunting village in the heart of the forest or at a friendly camp of Orcs pitched atop a soaring mesa.

The Vorndgad Forest is calling for you. Do you have the courage to enter?

The Skyrim: Home of the Nords Team are proud to present the first release in our efforts at bringing the province of Skyrim to the world of TESIII: Morrowind. It represents the work of many talented modders over the past few years and includes the following features:

48 exterior cells of meticulously detailed wilderness

31 interior cells

52 non-hostile NPCs

1 fully-fledged settlement and 2 mini-settlements to visit

3 new creatures introduced to the Vorndgad Forest

4 new sets of armor to collect in-game

7 new books and documents that flesh out the lore of Skyrim.

20 “Skyrim lore” dialogue topics composed by our lore experts.

SHotN is designed to be played by reasonably high-leveled characters. Your character should at least be able to survive enemies on the level of Tribunal and Bloodmoon. Our team also recommends using MGE (Morrowind Graphics Extender) while playing our mod. Our mod is designed with it in mind and it will also aid in navigating our lands

Teleportation to the Vorndgad Forest is available from Jurid Fast-Travel in the Skyrim Mission in Ebonheart. Alternately

**--- State of the Project ---**

Our team is focusing its efforts on creating Skyrim one Hold at a time, even as progress has been made in other modding departments as well. The Reach exterior is already around 50% finished and steady progress is also being made in interiors as well, with the most work being done on interiorizing the massive city of Karthwasten. Karthwasten is currently planned to be the crowning jewel of our next release, County Karthwasten, the land that runs along Skyrim’s border with Hammerfell. While it isn't slated for release in the near future, SHotN's founder and chief exterior modder Lestat de Lioncourt recently finished work on the vast forest that covers half of Haafinheim, the snowy Hold to the north of the Reach. 

Our project is only made possible by passionate volunteers. If you’re a modder or willing to learn about becoming one

In fact I shall share it!

First thing off the boat make enough gold to take the silt strider to Vivec. Then proceed to the top of the Redoran Canton. Once there go inside Dralor Manor and head upstairs. There is only one room up there with a women inside, just grab the vault key and head out of the manor and right over to the Redoran Treasury (other the other side of the canton). Once in the Treasury head to the lowest vault and use the key. Now that you are in the vault there will be one Ordinator inside. You need wait them out with the door open and they will eventually all exit the vault. Once they do just shut the door and commence massive loot stealing.

Oh btw

So at level 1 you will have the following items: Ebony: Closed helm,Mace,Shortsword, and Tower shield. Glass: Random assortment of 3 items in one of the crates, dagger, and axe. Also tons of the random loot in the chests!

Y'know

I've played different races on each of the games

Firstly, because they do sound similar). But you'll never hear a bosmer with the voice of a dunmer, or an argonian with a high elf's voice.

Move to Oblivion, and im sure I've seen Imperials sound like orcs.

Then Skyrim, sounding less 'gruff', and the dunmer have suddenly gotten a strange English dialect. Not to mention once again a few nords/imperials sound like orcs (I'm looking at you, guy selling wardogs outside Markarth). 

- then we move to my favourite thing about Morrowind:

The 'beast' races have a unique posture
Whilst Skyrim has the differing atlmer height

The loss of the 'beast' pose was a major hit to me. In Morrowind

And the massive thing that really hurts; If you play as an argonian in Morrowind - not only do you have a different walk animation

I was so annoyed when I made an Argonian on Skyrim

Sure you can put it down to game engine limitations

Now please don't send the dark brotherhood after me for this, or even expanded upon! Surely Nords would walk about proudly with their head held high, whereas imperials would walk like most common folk.

So

I will go through it one by one because I'm insane/obsessed with character building in video games. :|

**Name: Alemug** because why not? He was raised by Nords or something. I like it leave me alone.

* **Altmer** for incredibly high magicka

* **Atronach** for more incredibly high magicka but especially to counter the Altmer's weakness to spells as well as use summons to restore my magicka via absorption.

* **Class specialization: Magic** since it's +5 to most of my major/minor skills.

* **Favored Attributes** **Endurance** because HP is not retroactive

* **Major skills**:

**Alchemy** for easy $$$ for training, so as a major skill + altmer bonus I can get it up to a lucrative level shortly as well as see all four effects of ingredients sooner which is convenient.

**Alteration** for levitation to make use of ranged attacks vs. tough enemies and get around some areas

**Conjuration** My absolute favorite. For summons to restore my magicka by having them cast into my 50% absorption from atronach. For bound bow/spear for powerful early weapons that give bonuses to the skills and are weightless. +Bound armor. Also, that kind of thing.

**Marksman** for ranged damage that can't reflect back on me and will damage the many nigh-magic immune enemies later in the game. At low levels especially

**Restoration** for healing/restoring fatigue and attribute buffs primarily. Why bother with speechcraft when you can fortify personality? And of course

* **Minor skills**:

**Illusion** for night eye and eventually perhaps some invisibility. I play only with the graphics overhaul but it makes some places very dark so just being able to cast a low potency night eye helps with exploring tombs especially.

**Enchant** For late game

**Mercantile** For extra gold early on and for bribing trainers to get them to 100 disposition as I will be paying a few trainers a lot of gold early on for armor training to raise endurance to 100 ASAP.

**Mysticism** For teleportation spells and soul trap.

**Spear** Was debating over this vs. blunt vs. axe for quite awhile. Blunt is the inbetween, as my melee weapon will generally be used most against less threatening enemies, the extra reach of a spear lets me kill critters with less chance of getting blight from some asshole cliff racer. And spears are a special part of Morrowind that should've obviously not been taken out in Oblivion/Skyrim, as well as being kind of fitting as a backup weapon for an archer I feel. As a minor rather than major skill, I also get more endurance from training it. I considered having it as misc, but then, it doesn't feel as much a part of my character as it should be. +I want it to level at a decent rate later on.
 

**Other notes**: 

All attributes are represented by at least one misc skill so I can easily raise them via training in nice x5s. 

My major/minor skills tend to be matched with my highest attributes well

Ancestral Ghost + Non-magical/enchanted weapon type = free/easy extra weapon training

I am a towering golden elf wizard and I will look badass in a colovian fur helm and a robe.

&gt; Line 4-5: 'Outlander Incarnate' appears as a formal epithet, Dagoth Ur is served by his seven kin, once great wizard-lords, called 'ash vampires' by the Ashlanders.
&gt; Line 6-7: 'Star-blessed' suggests Azura, and prophecy. 'Thrice-cursed blade' may refer to a weapon called Keening, associated in certain legends with the Battle of Red Mountain and Dwemer craftlord Kagrenac. 'Reap the harvest' is a reference to the proverb, ""You harvest from the seeds you plant,"" which means you get what your labors deserve, in both a positive sense of reward and negative sense of punishment. **The 'unmourned house' could be either or both of the lost Great Houses of the Dunmer -- House Dwemer and House Dagoth.**

So what is /r/morrowind 's opinion on this?  Were the Dwemer just a house of Chimer that further rebelled against the ways of the Aldmer AND their Chimer brethren and chose science and further 'profane' magics like Man?  Or is this just an example of a mistake within lore that the devs initially hadn't decided on and ended up changing but not before missing some lore mistakes in their books?

 I realize this should probably be taken to /r/teslore which I probably will but only if the answer here isn't satisfactory.",,t5_2r9nv,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Morrowind/comments/18t80f/are_the_dwemer_really_supposed_to_be_just_a_house/

Basically, and remember that I read that the game was so buggy that you *had* to dispose of all corpses, or it'd eventually lag/destroy your game at later levels.

In retrospect this seems pretty silly

********

I suppose it begins on the ship. It was a prison ship, seeing the practice applied to her own people.


Political history aside, though. Couldn't sleep for an hour with one dream or another. The last day out at sea was stormy, as usual. I dreamed as usual. But by Y'ffre, it was a strange one.


It started with the same nightmare I'd had ever since learning I was being deported to the ashpit the natives call Morrowind. Dusty wastes, and a reverberating female voice began to speak.


*""They have taken you from the Imperial City's prisons""*

 Yes


*""First by carriage

And a damn bumpy ride it was


*""To the east

That's the idea. 


*""Fear not


Now, in addition to calling my sanity into question, did not exactly fill me with comfort.


""Wake Up. We're Here. Why are you shaking? Are you ok?"" I suppose being woken up by the Dunmer came as something of a relief. He was grey-skinned and bare chested. If I saw him now


""Wake up. Stand up."" he said. ""There you go. You were dreaming. What's your name?"" Was it that obvious? At any rate


As he spoke


The guard was a short man, and he said to me in a tone that invited no argument: ""This is where you get off. Come with me.""


As he led me out of the hold, the swaying of the ship became more pronounced, and in the dim light of the hold this made moving somewhat difficult. At last, we reached the hatch leading to the deck. The Imperial stood next to the steps and motioned for me to continue.


""Get yourself up on deck

There was a post on 4chan's /b/ - at least that's where I found it - that explained why Elder Scrolls lore is basically a masterpiece of a genius. It explained it all from the roots, explained the role of your character in all the games, and so on.
