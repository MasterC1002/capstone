**Would you be interested in a daily meal delivery service that gives you fresh and/or frozen meals with all relevant nutritional, for ~$5 per meal, delivered daily/weekly/etc?**

**What would you like to see in a service like this

**Under what circumstances would you choose to use it?**

I'd never considered setting up a business myself (any advice on that front would be great, but I CAN cook (as several people on this subreddit can attest to), and I love it.

Prior to today I have been rear ended TWICE while at a complete stop

This morning, keeps their blinker on. At this point they are maybe a foot to two feet infront of me, going considerably slower. Then, without hesitation, they fly into my lane full force. Thank god (or whoever) that at the St Laurent portion of the 417 there is a full ""lane"" to the side where people can pull over etc. With my cat ninja reflexes I narrowly avoided certain distaster, going 120, he missed me my millimetres.

At these speeds

I'm absolutely sick of this shit. What is with people who can't drive for shit getting on the highway in Ottawa? I've had enough merging onto the highway at 50km and enough times of narrowly avoiding major crashes. 

About a KM later we came to a brief full stop (nicholas) because there was sligh traffic there. My only regret was that I didn't get out of my car and made sure this guy was aware that he not only put my life and his life in dire danger

I am going to invest in a dash cam and I plan on starting a Youtube channel for all the would be murderers on Ottawa roads. If anyone has any reccomendations on those

Like dealing with customers is solely a bus driver burden. They get payed extremely well to deal with customers as I see it. I take their rude comments and lack of care for their customers lightly and try not to let it bother me. But now they have gone too far.

A late bus driver was driving my pregnant girlfriend to work. She is 8 months now and very big. He was driving recklessly fast as he was late. She pulled the cord to get off at the next stop. The bus driver goes to pass the stop and realizes he has missed it because he is driving too fast. He slams on the break and my girlfriend falls over and hits the side of her belly as she does. Stricken she tells the bus driver that he's was driving too fast and there are people on the bus that could get hurt (even though she is currently hurt). The bus driver loses it on her and as she is leaving the bus honks at her all the way down the street

She is so stricken that I just got the phone call and am on my way to the hospital. She was in hysterics. Balling her eyes out on the phone for fear that her (and my) unborn child may be hurt

He was clearly not having a great day but this is insane! We have called OC Transpo to complain but will that do anything? We've all called. Nothing gets done. These guys are invincible due to their tight knit union. This is absolute madness. Yelling at a pregnant woman for being upset that your driving recklessly? What is the bus system coming to?

Cyclists: if you're in a hurry to get to work / get home / win Olympic gold, runners, dogs, skateboards etc at 20mph on your carbon fibre speed machine might seem like fun, but someone's going to get hurt. Badly. 

Also, or its elderly owner, or a bench, or a small child. Think about what you're doing, please.

As well, get some lights. They're for others to see you at least as much as you to see others.

Runners: whilst it might be motivational for you to run in large phalanxes along the path, please.

Walkers: yes, and don't spread right across the path oblivious to all other users, forcing cyclists onto the grass and runners to have to try and weave through the gaps between your group. It's just basic consideration.

Here is what you need to know:

-	You must be 16 or older to attend. Strictly enforced;

-	The cover charge is $10 and will be donated to the Youth Services Bureau of Ottawa;

-	The cover charge includes unlimited laser tag

-	The LAN party will be setup by Redditors

-	The fort party area will have a solid

-	Pajamas and nightwear are encouraged;

-	There are an additional bunch of rooms/areas that can be used for whatever you wish. Want to set up a board game room? Party room 2. Magic tournament? Party room 5. Knitting classes? VIP Room. The sky is the limit; set it up and make it happen.  Funhaven is the stage and Reddit is the show;

-	Alcohol will be available at Funhaven until 2:00am

-	You can bring your own snacks if you like

-	No outside alcohol;

-	No open flames. Ever. Don’t even think of fire. Starting two days before the event;

-	Music will be provided;

-	Doors will be open all night for in and out access; and

-	You must vacate the premises by 9:00am Sunday morning when our usual birthday parties are beginning. Bleary-eyed Redditors would probably scare small children.

It is important that everyone understands the spirit of this event. We are creating a fun night that benefits charity for socialization in a pleasantly awesome environment. I’ve never seen a massive fort party before, I want to be absolutely clear that if you’re interested in getting smashed, this is not the place to do it. We will be actively and diligently preventing both underage drinking and excessive consumption throughout the entire night. If you are intoxicated when you arrive, you will be turned away at the door. Drinking responsibly is fine for adults as always.

For this event, playing some awesome laser tag, dancing to some good tunes, building elaborate fort structures, bowling a few frames, and anything else you can imagine that does not cause grief to those around you.

I would like to recruit a minimum of five volunteer Fort Rangers who will be responsible for patrolling the fort to make sure that it is running smoothly. These individuals will receive free food

Sorry for the really long post

TL;DR Bring a clean blanket.

I would just like to take a second to talk about the shared pathways. Whether you're out there walking your dog, taking a stroll with a friend, smoking a j - whatever it is you're doing - please remember that you aren't alone on the pathway. Please be conscientious of your surroundings and try to be aware of what is going on around you.

**A few simple tips:**

* Keep to the right
* Cyclists
* Pedestrians
* Rollerbladers
* People walking two/three/four-abreast: please make way when someone approaches from behind. Shift right.
* Large groups of pedestrians
* If you are wearing headphones
* Most of all

I see all sorts of different behaviour and reactions out there, would go a very long way. Again, these are the *shared* pathways. Please share cooperatively!

Thanks!

AVOID this place!,LiquidHoney,96,11,67,"The large apartment building on the corner of Bell and Gladstone. 201 and 203 Bell street North are the WORST apartment buildings. I'm honestly just trying to save anyone else the hassle of living here. 

* The windows on the west side of the building are nailed shut because balconies are in the middle of construction. So you can't open your window. An A/C unit is now $250 a season (up from $100 last summer) and there are no exemptions/allowances made even though you can't open the windows
* Cockroaches. I don't have any in my unit except one or two I've found in the sink. But they are in the hallways and several other tenants I've spoken with have mentioned them. 
* On site laundry rooms are filthy. Garbage bins are rarely emptied and the amount of soap scum build up is insane. When someone does mop the floors in there (I've seen it once) the water he is using smells worse than the laundry room does. 
* They advertise an on-site fitness centre. Its a $50 deposit for a key. Not bad right? Except that it isn't part of the building that gets cleaned (wtf?) So there are weights scattered everywhere
* They have changed building management three times since September 2012. Tells you something right there. As of three weeks ago CLV Group is the management company.
* The automated entry system inside the front doors is constantly broken. So no one can call you to tell you they have arrived and you can't buzz anyone in. 
* Garbage everywhere! I realize this is a problem with the people living here as much as the management but often the chute will get stuck and rather than taking garbage someplace else it piles up blocking the stairwell until someone feels like cleaning it up on Monday. 
* The main stairway is a death trap. Obviously if you live on an upped floor an always take the elevator this isn't a problem. But if you live lower down

Those are things anyone can verify. Now for some personal horror stories. 

* Move in day: We arrived at around noon on the day we were scheduled to move in. Our apartment wasn't ready. We were asked to come back three times before I finally got pissed and said I'd just clean it myself. This was a mistake. There was still loose food in the cupboards
* A Queen sized mattress doesn't fit in any of the elevators. They say they have service elevators. This is a lie. All they do was hang padded fabric inside the regular elevator to protect the glass. 
* When asked for assistance both staff members (on separate occasions) basically said they weren't paid for that. 
* Taking my laundry out of the dryer once when a girl comes in crying hysterically. Someone stole all her stuff out of dryer
* This winter the power went out. Not much anyone can do to prevent that though. Hydro came and fixed it, no lights, -20 something outside and zero communication from management about when it would be back on.
* FFW today: Our internet has been slow so we called our provider. (I've since discovered any one with this provider has been having slow service for a few days) Yesterday they sent out a tech and he couldn't fix it as it was a problem with something as it came into the building
* ""Yo, liked it, it was in my rent range so I signed up! Canada Post tracking system tells me they got my deposit at aprox. 12:14. They called me at 12:15 to tell me the apartment I saw was no longer available but they had another one that was ""just a little bit different"". What other choice do I have? I can't take another ten hour drive back to look at more apartments, and they already have my bank draft. They were completely aware that I was vulnerable and took advantage of it. From the outside of the building I can see the apartment I was show. It was one of few that they said would have a new balcony on it by the time I moved in. It is still the only one with a finished balcony. I'm pretty sure (though can't prove) that they show lots of people that one finished apartment and then tell them the same story they told me. 

I usually wouldn't post something about where I live but thanks to an option they provided the entire building to drop out of their leases without penalty (The construction on the building is now going to be longer than expected) I'll only be in this crap hole another week or so. 

I really needed to rant about this horrible place so thanks for reading. If you didn't read it...

We've had citizens complain to us about witnessing a human body being torn apart on Rideau
 
At this very moment 7 highrise buildings are under construction or are pending construction; thousands more people to add to the already 30, and the dire situation downtown.
 
It's also rich of RPRA to believe the better part of 7 years by professional engineers, and two environmental assessments that the wrong choice was made.  To stop this bridge from being built would be condemning more people to die, and wasting ~20 million dollars of tax payer money.  Not to mention undermine the millions being spent on the Rideau Redevelopment, and the revitalization of the ByWard Market.
 
Perhaps the short time your community had to prepare is irrelevant.  Your opinion that the truck route should go elsewhere is not based on fact, determined by professionals in a strictly mandated federal process.

1296599055.0,fddwk,r/Ottawa - ANTI-UBB PROTEST THIS SATURDAY! PLEASE READ!,,86,6,48,"Hi everybody! **Please upvote this to the top so we can make sure everybody has access to the information!**


I set up the [Stop The Meter: Ottawa](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=130673687000309) rally yesterday while at work and just a bit over 24hrs later it's really snowballed. That's awesome and thank to all who have signed


We've run into a problem though. We were emailed by the *Committee on the Use of Parliament Hill* today and were told we're not able to use their grounds as they're already occupied. I feel stupid for not knowing that you had to apply for a permit for a peaceful protest and thought just a heads-up was sufficient. Either way, Parliament Hill or not.


So

Thank you for your suggestions!


**QUESTION** - Can Parliament really do anything if we're being peaceful and not stirring shit up? I highly doubt that the Zombie Walk or 4/20 ever have special permits to do this. Any thoughts?

**UPDATE 2/2/11** - So I met up with a few people last night and we threw some ideas around. I'm wondering if there's anybody here willing to help out with a few tasks to simply things?


**ANOTHER UPDATE 2/2/11 - 10:00am** - So, I think that's our best idea but we still have time.

**YET ANOTHER UPDATE 2/2/11/ - 1:45pm** - So. I've been in contact with Heritage Canada

It's looking like we're not going to be able to obtain an actual permit to protest on Parliament Hill though. I know

I'm not sure what our best bet is. I'm not sure if we should all just show up there anyways


-----**WHAT WE NEED SO FAR**-----

• If anybody is able to talk to Ottawa Police/City of Ottawa and let them know that this is planned. Please do and let us know what's going on!

• There's already a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/fdahi/hey_rottawa_lets_talk_about_rally_signs_for_this/) for signs and sign ideas. It'd be great to get a bunch of people idea to craft some signs. We *need* to keep these signs tasteful though. If we overdo the memes and whatnot

• There was talk last night that we need a chant. Something that we can all sing along to. Anybody have any ideas?

• There's still a lot of discussion as to where we can do this. Hopefully by the end of the today we'll have a better idea of where can accommodate us. I'll update accordingly! While I didn't agree with what they were protesting about

• If **anybody** has access to speakers or some kind of amplifying device. Please let me know

• If you plan on showing up just to be stupid

The idea was to go sit on a patio

Anyway we arrived and found a lot of the tables were soaking wet from the rain that had since stopped. We cleaned one near the edge off with a towel (previously planned on sitting on some wet ass grass) and sat ourselves. The place was 4/10 on the busy scale and 8/10 on the 'no one has any food or drink' scale

In the next 15-20 a bunch more people sat themselves at tables around us. Many wiped them down themselves. Our waitress came back a couple times too

I wandered around and visited all three bars asking for some beers. Everyone directed me to another bar. At the last one I felt pretty bad bugging the very busy bartender

We drank and waited for a while longer. The waitress made eyes at us several times and dashed away. I asked my girlfriend if maybe she was intimidated by my shockingly good looks and she said that I didn't look that good and that the waitress was just ignorant. That seemed more accurate. 

Eventually Malone himself came out (note: some large and in charge man, but I appreciated his forthrightness. I also thought he was coming in as a sort of business consultant, you know, to fix some shit and not take no for an answer. This didn't happen - he eventually vanished but left our umbrella up. What a sweetie.

Our waitress came back again after about another 20 minutes. She waltzed up and said that our umbrella needed to go ASAP and that we'd get wet if it rained. We knew already thanks to her wonderful boss. She folded the umbrella down and hit my head

Malone came back and asked a small woman sitting by herself why she had taken a four person table to herself. She didn't really answer but did say she didn't need the extra table (Two-two seaters squished together). She came from an earlier

Anyway we had given up on food at this point and mostly found the whole thing funny. Everyone wasn't very happy but stuck around for the fireworks. The view really was nice. The fireworks happened and everyone went apeshit. That was great.

We left immediately after, which would probably be made of an old umbrella and some barbed wire.

On the way out we saw a crowd lined up on the stairs to get in. What was keeping them out was a chain across the entrance with no one manning it. We left the restaurant by doing the limbo of shame under the chain. It was a very fitting end.

TLDR - Malone's Lakeside Grill should be renamed to Malone's Ignore-aporium. Malone himself cares very much about umbrellas. They may or may not serve food. They will attempt to serve tea,False,,t5_2qpoo,False,,,t3_1erunt

I just wanted to make everyone aware of two major speed traps that are being heavily watched by cops recently. The one that I drive by every day after work around 3-5pm is the section of Meadowlands Dr between Fisher Ave and Merivale Rd. There is always a cop here (with his motorcycle hidden), so it's pretty easy to go above.
The other which most people know about is on Heron Rd between Bronson Ave and Bank St. This is a fairly long stretch with four lanes
Be aware

**Update** Not sure why there's so much hate. I consider a speed trap as a long straight section of road with little traffic where the speed limit is lower than what most drivers would feel comfortable driving at. Not condoning driving recklessly at all.

So I stay and stand around like I'm waiting for a cab or something (and making a mental note of his license plate number, if he's just parked on the curb waiting for someone inside theres no way he's going to be there for more than 10 minutes (the main mall was closed, and there was hardly anyone in the store). About 20 - 30 minutes of this go by, with me standing there and him blasting french rap music out of his speakers and glancing at me in his sideview mirror. It was enough for me to decide that something was definitely up, so I went inside again and warned the cashier that there was a suspicious vehicle parked outside and I gave a description of what the guy looked like and the plate numbers.

**FindMichelleYu's Status:**
    Thank-you for joining us this past week in prayer and in action. This has been a difficult time for the Yu family and they have been overwhelmed by all the support and love they have received.

We are ecstatic to let you know that contact has been made with Michelle. She is safe. The family requests that you respect their privacy at this time.

Thank you again for all your help.

***
On Tuesday April 17th

None of her family or friends have heard from her since. Here are the important details:

1. It is uncharacteristic of her to run away. Her family and close friends do not believe this is likely.

2. At 6pm on Tuesday

3. Her phone has been off since 3pm on Tuesday the 17th.

4. She has a heart condition that requires daily medication

  Considering the circumstances (especially her heart condition), and there are only a few minutes of local news coverage every night about this. This is why we NEED the internet to help spread her image, so that citizens can fill the void and effectively be this constant search party. It has been 5 days, and she could be anywhere in Canada by now if she has been abducted, so we have to inform people in Vancouver, Montreal, Calgary, Halifax

A good friend of mine hired them for a move last week and got ripped off

Here is her story:

&gt;The customer service provided to us by ""Sam's Moving"" was atrocious. Not only were our movers half an hour late they refused us service if we did not agree to a higher rate with 3 movers and 2 trucks
&gt;
&gt;They deemed us as ""disorganized"" despite the fact we were paying for a service. They scratched several of our shelves which were only a year old and virtually flawless previous to the move. Which I suppose is to be expected but  is magnified by the other issues at hand, which is still astronomical considering we could have hired a set of professional movers for a lesser rate.
I do believe we were highly taken advantage of and I would like to prevent this in the future. Also
&gt;
&gt;A 2 bedroom apartment does not require a 9 hour move with 20 minutes smoke breaks every hour as well as an hour long lunch break. I have moved many times in my life and have never encountered such treatment and I truly find it appalling. I was tempted to get the police involved after the threat was received but was actually concerned for my safety.

Our waitress was great and tended to us right away asking if we wanted drinks and let us know that margaritas were 1/2 price tonight. Score. So we waited for the next people to arrive and ordered up some margaritas

Margaritas arrive. Waiting for the other 2 people to arrive I couldn't resist my frosty drink any longer, he poured it all in the drink. Everyone at the table joked that it tasted like a salt lick. Anyhow, after much deliberation, I felt bad and sent the second margarita back and just ordered a beer.

Everyone is finally there. Waitress comes back with my beer and we all order a plate of nachos, a few jalapenos slices, the nachos consisted of colored chips with melted orange cheese and a blob of sour cream on the side. There were no beans, and no guacamole as the menu said there would be. So we essentially paid $14.00 for a few chips, a sprinkle of cheese, 2 tbsp of salsa and shriveled up jalapeno peppers that came from either a can or a jar. When we complained there was no beans and guacamole, our waitress said nachos no longer come with beans

And to top off my night, really? You're even going to fuck up my salad. So I pull it out and as I'm eating I'm realizing the whole damn bowl of salad is brown, old, slimy and disgusting. After pulling out all the brown chunks, there was nothing left, and I just gave up.

The ONLY thing that saved this experience for me was that the waitress brought my friend a complimentary slice of cheesecake for her birthday. This waitress deserves a gold star, and she didn't give me a hard time at all. Kudos to you Blue Cactus girl, your great, but your restaurant is awful. Gordon Ramsey would be appalled.

I'm not particularly good at this whole reddit deal yet, and found this puppy running down a county road in a high-dump area on Sunday afternoon. 


I've reported him to three shelters


Unfortunately, and you can't push him. Many people don't understand this because he is overwhelmingly cute and everyone wants to cuddle him. He will bond to his ""person"" within a day or two, and will get more comfortable with strangers when his person is there. When I found him, I couldn't touch him without being snapped at, and within two days, he was jumping all over my lap and licking my face.


He's housetrained so long as he's let out every 5 hours or so


So - if anyone remotely close to Ottawa wants an adorable, please let me know!


I assume someone will let me know if I've reddited wrong. Also

My dad got the money! Thanks everyone for your support and interest in my story. After almost 3 weeks

**EDIT 2**
So my ex-bosses are very, they now say they will meet my dad on Tuesday and pay him the money I'm owed then. I'm leaving to Barrie tomorrow, so I won't be able to be there, but my dad can handle these assholes. That is, if they're true to their word, which so far, they have not been. We contacted the police again to give them an update but they've told us there's nothing they can do for us because it's a ""civil matter"" and they have no way of finding these people since they are most likely using fake names and have no registered home/business address or home phone number. We're on our own. My dad may still hire a P.I if they don't pay him on Tuesday just for the hell of it, these people wasted my summer. If I had wanted to volunteer for 4 weeks I would've gone to the humane society or something... Fucking scammers got me so angry. It's nto about the money anymore



**EDIT**
Thanks everyone! You had good suggestions and helped me vent some of this frustration. After checking the number with the cops and coming up with no hits, lo-and-behold, he got a call back. They are going to (*hopefully*) pay me this Tuesday. If they don't, you can bet my dad will be all over their asses. These guys are clearly up to some shifty shit and were not answering my calls because of my number. We filed a temporary report with local police and with the Labour Board to make sure people don't get ripped off in the future. 

Tl;Dr: I'm getting my payment












So this summer I worked with a company called Clear Thru Windows who offer a window cleaning service. My job was to go door to door and get people signed up for window cleaning. The first two weeks went great and I was making $13/h. After the next two weeks, texts, or phone calls. I looked them up on Canada 4-1-1 and their names don't even exist. They have no home phone, no address. These people scammed me out of over 30 hours of work. They owe me more than $400. I AM FUCKING FURIOUS. I can't file a legitimate police report or labour complaint because their names may not even be their real names! I have never been so irritated and angry and upset. I worked for these people for free. I REALLY need that money and now I'll never see it. Don't work for these people, don't take service from these people. They're con artists.",,False,t5_2qpoo,True

1322014725.0,mm81o,My first day with OC transpo....,octransposucks,60,5,104,"Hi /r/Ottawa

I moved to Ottawa in the summer, I decided the bike had to go away for the winter. So today, I took OC Transpo for the very first time. Let me tell you my story.

First, one transfer. No problem, right? Wrong. 

My bus was slated to come every 10 minutes, he ignored a couple of stops on the transitway while the ""stop"" light was lit up and some high school students were yelling that they wanted off, but it was on the transit way and didn't really affect me, so I didn't think too much about it. The transfer went find and I was off to work.

End of the day, it arrives and I breathe a sigh of relief. But it doesn't stop. And neither does the next one, nor the one after that. Frustrated, I walk the 2km to the station where I was about to get my transfer. After waiting 15 minutes, I was told by another passenger the bus probably wouldn't come. What! The last three hadn't shown up. Luckily, the next one, after about 25 minutes did show up. Again, as the passenger was an elderly man with a walker who would have to walk the 4 blocks or so back. 

Finally made it home. I absolutely cannot believe the hassle that commute was. What was initially supposed to be a 36 minute commute turned into over two hours. How do you native Ottawans deal with this? Is there anyone I can complain to? I feel like just toughing it out on my bike. Anyone have any advice? Certainly wasn't a good first experience.

Sorry for the rant.

We raised $2360 for the YSBO

While the overall event was very successful

- We learned that people are prepared to have fun deep into the night
- We learned that our Laser Tag guns are prepared to have fun deep into the night
- We learned that we should probably include all of the activities in the package to provide more capacity for more people to be simultaneously having fun.
- We learned that the LAN party portion needs to be more organized to align computers and software for common play.
- We learned that prompting for organic organization to an online community provides lots of great volunteers
- We learned that Fort Parties are great social constructs that do not necessarily stand up well when competing with lasers, set up their forts, and then went to play in the facility for the next 8 hours. I'm not sure how you could address this other than shutting the rest of the facility down at a set time like 2:00am.
- We used wall structures from our haunted house to create the fort structure. I have mixed feelings about how that worked. Some people enjoyed the separate forts
- We learned that Reddit is awesome

I would encourage you to post your own recommendations on how a similar event should be run in the future. Also

Thanks for you help, and your patience with the multiple Fort Party posts. I'll return to being a quiet reader after this post.

I'm not sure how many people plan on being downtown this year. Maybe some of you are reading this and planning on visiting or for others it may be your first time. 

Either way - here's a bit of info which should make things go a bit more smoothly

**STREET CLOSURES**

If you're coming downtown

**WHAT TO DO?!**

There's so much to do. I'm a fan of just wandering around and seeing what's what. There's all sorts of street performances going on and chances are if you're downtown, as it'll save you some time if there's some awesome stuff you want to see.

I started a new subreddit to help out people in Ottawa get around the city or the province. I know there are a lot of students here that depend on craigslist for rides so I figured why not reddit? Looking to save on gas when heading out of town? Drop a line here and see if anyone needs a lift.

If you have any information please let me know

I was told that the good folks on the Ottawa reddit would be a great source of help. 

I feel terrible using my first post to ask for help

It was my mothers car

If you fine people have any other suggestions

Thanks in advance for all your help.


Edit: I just received a phone call from the police. Apparently they found our car in Perth. I'm on my way now to pick it up. They said there is ""some damage"". Hopefully not too much.

Thank you so much for all the help &amp; support.

I'll upload a picture as soon as I get it back.

2 Weeks later I got my car and it looked great on the outside but the repairs were poorly done.  My headliner wasnt on straight and full of oil\dirt, forgot to replace some weather stripping that was damaged and didnt provide a OEM hood as to what I ask to have.

When I confronted them on all these problems the owner\manager rudely informed me that they subbed the PDR repair and that it wasnt his problem.  After talking with my insurance they called the shop and the shop told me to come in so they can fix the rest of the things (at their expense) minus the hood because ""I signed the approved a aftermarket one"".  Even though I verbally requested OEM (was expecting to pay the difference) they followed my insurance policy to the T without even asking my what I wanted done as options.

After complaining that I didnt want the non-certified hood they went half way and I settled for a certified A\M hood (this helped me later).

I requested a one on one with the manager to talk about the poor job on my car and he really pissed me off when he said ""sir

Now I made a careless mistake. I knew the apartment I was visiting had had them, heat treatment is more thorough and as an added bonus you get to keep most of your stuff.

When traveling, make sure to take proper precautions. Upon entering, put your shoes and bags in sealed garbage bags and leave them in the bath tub. Be on the look out for the three bite pattern and be aware that bites can take 3-14 days to show up. Also, ask any hotels if they've had previous cases and consider staying elsewhere if they have.

I've made a careless and costly mistake but you don't have to. They are spreading like wildfire and while the bites themselves aren't that bad the thought of sleeping in a bed infested with parasites is not fun.

Edit: a few more additions. When traveling, however they can be in drawers, piles of clothes, outlets, behind picture frames, electronics, basically anywhere. Be on the look out for blood and fecal spots on your mattress,,1341930735.0,t3_wbt2g

It's a really good deal. It's in IMAX, saving even more. I went to the 5 pm show today, and although there was a decent line to get in (they didn't open the doors until 10 minutes before the show), they definitely weren't sold out. Show up at least 30 minutes in advance, like a regular theatre, and you should have great seats. The seats are better than many multiplexes, and you can never have your view blocked by someone in front of you. And you don't have to sit through 10-20 minutes of ads and trailers before the movie starts (which could be a positive or negative thing).

Really, so at least there's that.

The ban [was lifted yesterday](http://www.xtra.ca/public/Toronto/GSA_ban_lifted_by_Halton_Catholic_school_board-9661.aspx) in a vote that sadly wasn't unanimous.

The Ottawa Catholic School Board still has their ban in place. Learning from the PR mistakes of Halton, the same article says:

&gt; Here in Ottawa

These clubs are still banned. They spin it as a move for equity and social justice

&gt; Teachers must consult the following: Section 2357 and 2358 (always together) of the Catechism of the Catholic Church 1997. Letter to All Involved in Catholic Education – Church Teaching on Sexual Maturity (Document 370303 Assembly of Catholic Bishops); and any other relevant document fully and entirely consistent with the Doctrine of the Catholic Church following: “…as reference and resource”

The Catechism of the Catholic Church

&gt; ...tradition has always declared that ""homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered."" They are contrary to the natural law. Under no circumstances can they be approved.

More from the Assembly of Ontario Bishops:

&gt; For most young people, kissing, dating and dancing that are romantically intended are all acceptable within appropriate limits.

&gt; It will be especially difficult for young persons who are experiencing homosexual romantic yearnings to understand and accept this teaching of the Church since it discourages romantic behaviour that would be acceptable in a heterosexual context.

I'm sure the Assembly of Ontario Bishops do care about equity and social justice. But it's pretty clear that that doesn't extend to the students under their care that have a different orientation or gender identity. It's homophobia with a nice face.

We shouldn't tolerate this crap here in Ottawa. Young LGBT students already have lots of shit to deal with

They guy showed me that it was ""working"" on his weak ass subwoofer, and if I blew it then he could keep it. As I was setting it up, he was disconnecting some stuff on his car.

Both are good with other cats, but not declawed. 

* Fluffer-Nutter is about 6 years old and a small bundle of fluff. He is grey and white, and he'll follow you everywhere. With practice, Fluff has also been known to shake a paw, sit, and stay. 

* Strider (LOTR) is a 5 year old huge black cat with a tiny patch of white on his chest. He is an extrovert and comes from a great bloodline (I knew his mom and grand-mom) and is a huge ham. When you pick him up he gives kisses. He can be incredibly goofy

The wait wasn't too long, and gave me a prescription for clarithromycin. Standard stuff, thought nothing of it, so I'm probably partially to blame for not inquiring further.

Anyway, but she diagnosed and confirmed with a blood test that I have mono, and gave me a few days worth of prednisone to help with the swelling.

So, I finally got to sit down with one of the guys.   As it turns out they are looking to completely replace their Wednesday night staff in hopes of gaining some new customers.

So, I'm having a hard time with this.

This is where you come in Reddit.  Go down to Pier 21 tomorrow night.  Tell them JD sent you and you can skip the lineup.  Highballs are only $3.00 and drop-shots are $3.50.  This is a win-win for everyone!!

My name's Lindsay (a guy's name where I'm from) and I'm coming over to uOttawa on exchange next semester (which would be fall semester for you guys I think? It starts in September.). I'm from the University of Western Australia in Perth

Basically, and I've paid the ridiculous rents that Perth charges, so I'll be able to handle most of what Ottawa can throw at me. I'm a very good cook (my Thai is boss, my Italian is good), and I keep things clean - I fucking hate not being comfortable in my own space, and do my best to make it comfortable for everyone. With that said, I love having a drink or six if you're down. I'm a very outgoing type.

Personally, everything from ridiculous prog metal to hip-hop to ambient. For a bit of a feel: I'm listening to the new The Knife album as I write this, I'm really digging that they're pretty much saying 'fuck you' to expectations. I play drums in a band in Perth. Some people think we're pretty good, you may agree. Other than that, I'm into travel, science, history, whiskey

Anyway, I'd really appreciate if anyone interested would give me a chance. I'd much prefer to live with with someone who knows the city, and who can give me a more 'authentic' experience, I guess. I know that sounds a bit pretentious, sorry. I'd also enjoy living with a Redditor, as you a clearly an individual of high class and learnings. Or something.

Anyway, email at lindsaydick.aus@gmail.com , or facebook at facebook.com/lindsaydick . I have a skype account but the computer I'm currently on doesn't have a microphone or webcam, so it's not much use. I can get it working if you want to talk to me though.

Cheers guys! I'm really looking forward to coming to Ottawa!
