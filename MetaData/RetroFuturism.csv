I didn't see anything much come up in a search about EPCOT or Horizons

[Horizons1 tribute site](http://www.horizons1.com/). (turn down your speakers)

[Mesa Verde Times](http://mesaverdetimes.blogspot.com).  The blog of a couple of guys named Hoot and Chief who did what so many of us dreamed of doing when we were kids... they jumped out of their ride cars and climbed all through the Horizons environments

[Horizons Resurrected](http://horizonsresurrected.com/).  This guy has been working hard to re-create Horizons, and his works-in-progress are available to explore.  My computer chokes on it, but my computer can barely play Minecraft.  Most people probably won't have issues.
