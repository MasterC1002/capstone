Katie, 2007 and got married October 31st

On Thursday night, and sat within 15 feet of the emergency exit where the shooter entered. About 15 minutes into the movie, the terrorist came in and “did what he came to do” according to CNN. Katie told me he came in through the emergency exit at the bottom right of the theater, and threw something over their heads. “I thought it was a prank at first, or someone playing along with the movie because it happened during a fight scene.” Katie told me. “Then he opened fire, and Caleb was shot in the right eye as they all tried to duck in cover. “I thought he was dead, because there was so much blood, and he kept running his fingers through his hair.” Katie and her friend Ashley were staying down right next to Caleb until the shooter left the theater. Within minutes the police was taking people out of the theater, and I did not find out if he was still alive until they released me at about 4 am.

Caleb is now in the ICU, and is fighting for his life. He has been to surgery twice already, has received over 4 liters of blood, and must go back to get his right eye removed and the pellets from the shot gun removed. Caleb is a friend, a husband, a son, and about to be a father.

For the first time the two years I took of ASL back in high school paid off. 
The guy was lost and had no idea how to get back home or communicate with someone in the mall besides writing things down on paper. I asked where he was trying to get to and it was about 15 minutes in the opposite direction. I told the guy I will make sure he got where he needed.

Glinda met my wife and 3 boys through an equally wonderful lady “mamasboys” who bought pizza for my family.  She asked for a picture of my children



I politely declined, no matter what.  Other families were much more deserving.  Mamasboys insisted, as a thank you for purchasing pizza for us, that I post in RAoC, and Glinda was more than happy to read our post. 



I don’t want to embarrass her, and of course, she would hear none of it. 
 


We sent a small Kohl’s list of around 8 or 9 items, based on our list, of:  clothes, coats, toys, puzzles, electronics, pants, warm (expensive) coats



Now, my wife and I simply broke down and cried.  Believe me when I say, I don’t cry, unless Mufasa is taking his eternal plunge into the stampede at the hands of Scar.  That’s it. 



But this was above even that…these tears flowed, and the sadness of a every sad Futurama episode with them.  I felt like a new man…a father worthy of my children’s admiration.  Its been a long time since I felt I deserved that from my children.



Don’t misunderstand, even though my oldest is in middle school and may get embarrassed.  I try to show them how much they mean to me…but when one considers the simple fact that all a child wants is the innocent ability to play…to have fun, with both friends and family, but with themselves as well..and then, as a father you realize you cannot provide that to them during Christmas, it brings a soul crushing feeling of defeat and shame.  It’s a simple fact, and I have lived with it since the economy crashed in Las Vegas.  I have a good job, it does me
However, I felt a little less stress, and a LOT more happiness for my boys.  



As for my wife and my presents, and a simply gorgeous Coach purse for my wife. My wife opened it and said “oh my god…no way..oh my GOD…oh…my…GOD…it’s so beautiful…this is what I would pick 1000 times out of 1000 choices”  and this was before she even pulled it out of the box and I had any idea what it was.  



She explained the sheer beauty that is a Coach purse to me, she usually does the 2 for $20 deals so she can have multiple colors.  I swear on my children, that is the complete truth.  We have not had the ability to indulge  in luxuries like purses for a long…LONG time. 



At any rate, since our marriage 10 years ago (10 years next month :) )but she did it in a way that made us feel special…like we truly mattered to her.



My wife and I both have had issues with our families growing up that most people would consider utterly devastating, even, dare I say, genuine LOVE from a total stranger.  It made us feel like we need to be better people on this planet.  We need to share happiness whenever possible.  We are not deserving of what Glinda has given us…but we need to try.
And of course, but for the past 2 years, since he became eligible, we have not had the money to sign him up.  In Vegas, youth football leagues are not just for the children, they are designed to actually make money off the children and parents,  so the cheapest we’ve found is $160 to sign up, or anything other than just “welcome to Nevada Youth Football league. “  Nothing else. 



Glinda, to send $200 to Xathan to sign him up for football, and the extra to be used towards his uniforms and equipment costs.  The very HOUR it became available to us, we went and signed him up for it.  That morning, he was so nervous about not making the 60 pound cut off for tackle, (he would have to play with 6 year olds if he was less than 60 lbs) that he ate 5 pieces pizza, 2 PB&amp;Js, all without us knowing he was doing it.  He weighed in at 61.5 lbs :)  I was so happy for him



But it didn’t stop there. All of a sudden



She decided to visit Vegas, insists we meet for breakfast, of course, at her expense.  I do my best to decline politely, as she’s done wayyyy too much already, but we’re dying to meet her, and Xathan (my middle child, she wont hear any of it.



We meet at the Paris buffet, instantly breaks any ice, and makes my wife and I (both of who have trouble socially) feel like we’ve known her forever.  



Reddit, and Willy Wonka.  She is so fun loving, so open minded, so completely care-free that when you’re In her presence, you feel like family, friend and sincere confidant rolled into one.  She’s made from a different mold…that’s all I can say about her.. My wife and I instantly and completely fell in love with her.  Forgetting all the giving, the caring, because it was truly something worthy to be jealous of missing.  We adored her



Of course, who have taken to her more than they have anyone in our family.   At this point, I don’t even try to interject, as I know it’s futile.  She had hinted that she was going to do this ahead of time, and it was painfully, and clearly obvious that she gets more joy out of helping others, especially children



But, prizes, and who knows what else. Of course she’s crazy, it’s completely too much.  I say “Glinda…are you sure?”  she says “…I think so..my coffee isn’t drugged. I’m of sound mind”  and that was it. There was no arguing..no fighting…nothing other than AdventureDome and a day of fun.  That was simply the end of it, and had I continued to argue the point, she would’ve probably stabbed me in the eye with a  fork.  She takes her new family and their fun very seriously. 



She had given my 2 year old a stuffed bear, nor the physical act of handing MONEY to us..it’s just too much to handle.  We cried a few times..we hugged a lot…we feel we gained a family member, and we genuinely hope that she knows all this caring and giving will in no way change the fact that we feel we actually gained a loving and caring family member.  We’d be happy to visit her, to talk to her on the phone, to upvote everything she ever posts, without her ever giving one single additional thing to us.  We’re lucky to have a woman with such an amazing personality in our life, regardless of her desire to help those less fortunate.  
We found a woman…a stranger that is capable of generating love that I’ve never felt for anyone in my family.  My wife
It was amazing.  The breakfast was amazing…our Christmas was mind boggling beautiful thanks to Glinda…and my outlook on life moving forward is better all thanks to her.



The pictures that follow do not do Glinda justice.  I just can’t capture the happiness.    There’s tons of other photos of everything Glinda sent, I left those images out.
Believe me, a close second, is the Christmas she gave my boys.  The items she sent, and the amount of time, effort and money she spent on my family is not something I’m sure she would be comfortable sharing.  You must understand, Glinda most assuredly did this to make for a wonderful Christmas for my children, and to my wife and myself.



Here’s the pics that show the happiness..the sharing..the smiles… That’s what’s important



We love you Glinda.  That will NEVER change.

Update: 11/10/11 8:44 am

The person who posted this ad replied to me and said ""You can visit the shelter between 12-4you today. These pups are in the intake building "" which most likely means that someone has to go there and physically pull the dog out.
If you can help, especially if you are out of state.
There are rescues in the area called http://guardianangeldogrescue.org and another one RUFF.PETFINDER.COM which might help to pull
Regardless

**Update 1: 11/10/2011 1:20 pm**

I just got off the phone with shelter. She is still alive, spay, vaccines etc. It will buy time to find someone who can take her. Please if you can, please give her a chance! 

The shelter done with euthanizing today, exams, etc. Even if you are out of state we can work out the transport, I might be able to chip in, maybe some other kind redditors do the same. 

I know that it is a drop in a sea of misery, not an abstract thing. Please, if you can help. Thank you. 

**Update 11/11/11**

Good news! Somebody adopted that pup last night and not only that! That person also adopted her mom (it turned out her mom was at the shelter too)

The papers were signed and this sweet pup is now out of the woods. She is still at the shelter and sometimes the adoptions get cancelled, because both dogs were at the shelter since Nov. 4 or 5 and nobody was interested. And then both got adopted yesterday! :)

Another sad fact I've learned during this ordeal is that the dog the owner surrenders gets euthanized much faster compared to a stray. Please think twice before you surrender

Thank you all, please consider an adoption first if you can. ",,False,self,t5_2szh3,True,,
1342744940.0,wuj6e,"I need help, Reddit. I have a special needs child, a newborn, and an unemployed wife. Please read this.",mcphizzle66,26, but here goes.

As I said in the title, and an unemployed wife. I am employed and I make enough money to keep us above water. However, we are living in a bug infested apartment. The reason being is that we pay over $1000 a month for health insurance. My wife cannot get a job as she has to stay at home and tend to our children. 

I was involuntarily separated from the US Air Force after 9 years. They separated me one month after my daughter was born. I was lucky as I was able to find a decent job a month after I was out

A little background on my son:
My son was born at 26 weeks and spent the first 109 days of his life in the NICU. He is 2 and a half years old now but struggles with cerebral palsy, but we are struggling right now to even make ends meet.

I'm not asking for much, it's your choice. I'm just hoping some kind soul will see this and reach out a helping hand. If you feel like you want to help, please message me.

I'll post some pics of my children in the comments.

Edit: Thank you to a Reddit friend for pointing out things I should add to my post. We live in Hattiesburg

Edit 2: Created a chipin event. [Feel free to donate there if you are so inclined](http://mcphailfamily.chipin.com/my-family-needs-better-living-conditions)

Edit 3: [People requested pics of me in uniform](http://imgur.com/a/yNYy4)

Edit 4: I have received a good many questions about this so I'll address it. My son's Cerebral Palsy is mild. He doesn't walk, and he will drink pediasure. We also push vitamins and fatty foods (Oils, milk, etc...) through the tube in his stomach. We have been working like crazy trying to get him to eat. We pay for all of the pediasure out of pocket (and it's not cheap). He has been in PT, OT, and speech since he was a year and a half old. Hope that answers any questions on him. If you have any more feel free to ask.

Edit 5: People have asked for more proof that I am who I say I am. [Hopefully this will suffice](http://imgur.com/BEmDJ)


UPDATE: Wow! You guys are awesome! So far we have received close to $700 and a bunch of very helpful items are being sent to us. We also are very thankful for all of the advice and thoughts you guys and gals have sent our way. I will post some pics of the kids with the stuff we receive as it comes in. Reddit

I got in line at DD behind a girl holding some coupons. It was clear that she was mentally challenged. After a minute or so, tennis skirt on, and racquet bag hanging from her back, was frantically running to the gate while simultaneously shouting her coffee order to her husband. She returned a minute later yelling at him to hurry... they argued back and forth about whether or not to get coffee and then she ran back to the gate. 

Meanwhile, ""nope."" The girl, very obviously confused, handed the coupons back. At this point, the cashier got frustrated and said, ""WE DO NOT TAKE THIS. You will have to pay full price."" The girl took the coupons back and held them closely to her face trying to read and understand.

Then, ""yes. I'll take a large iced-coffee and I'm going to help this girl get what she wants."" I asked her which sandwich she wanted and she pointed at both coupons, so I ordered both for her. I made sure to take my time getting out my wallet to pay for the sandwiches and coffee. The guy behind me yelled ""fuck it"" and ran to the gate.

I handed the receipt to the girl and told her to wait at the counter. She looked at me, then get to the airport early. Don't be an asshole.",,False,self,t5_2szh3,False,,

**Update: I spoke with the family about the concerns that people have expressed here. They provided this statement explaining their situation.**

""We got Bellabee around her 2nd birthday, and would not have pursued the situation had we not felt it in the best interest of Bellabee.  The situation changes constantly, and has been an emotional roller coaster mostly at the expense of Bellabee.  While the details are private for us and for the birth family, please know that we would not ask if the need were not great. We are able to take care of her, but are overwhelmed with the trial costs.  This little girl had already had more than 4 ""mothers"" and 3 ""fathers"" before the age of two all of which moved on when she was no longer the easy choice.  She is by no means the saddest story you will hear about a child being adopted, but she is our child and we are not taking the easy road and need some help with the final stretch.  If you do not feel like donating then please don't.  We have chosen to fight for what is best for Bellabee and are only asking for help from others so it doesn't bankrupt us in the process.""",,self,,

A few months went by without me seeing her
Was working at a local library while in school and one day coming out of work, sitting at the food court, I walk up and ask her out, she accepts.

First date goes well
I took a good entry level job within a technology firm in Montreal, struggled to find work for a few years, lost everything and only got back on my feet recently in a 'take any job I can find and go back to school situation'

She finished psychology and went into medecine

It'll be 10 years on the 2nd of March but her birthday is February 14th, but I know she's been wanting me to propose for a while.

I hope Reddit can give me a hand if any redditors in Montreal can help me find a nice restaurant reservation or any of you have a discount coupon to somewhere nice I could use the help. I'm currently studying to teach history at the high school level and working at the same time

.........

Update 1 - thank you all for the good vibes, I wish you all Karma and goodness galore, I will post all the craziness tomorrow. I might end up proposing at her mom's house in the evening, she has a hardcore studying schedule which makes it hard to get her out for even a few minutes but I will try hard ... 

Update 2 - turn up at the jeweler this morning with mom in tow, I babble  the entire way, i'm presently at work and waiting for him to call me with everything donezo

Update 3 - proposed

""She was diagnosed with leukemia in April 2010 and had her last treatment last month. During that time, skin burns and vomiting from the chemo, and steroid injections that compromised her immune system. She was hospitalized four times due to high fevers. She won't be ruled ""cancer free"" until five years after her last treatment.""

There are a lot of really decent OFFERS and REQUESTS out there at the moment.

This is why I feel it's even more kind to simply upvote the posts that look like they could use the recognition. I don't want to generalize

**Edit:** P.S. Being vigilant in the New section is a great way to give the great REQUESTS/OFFERS the recognition they deserve.

1328395409.0,pb4ra,[REQUEST] I ask a humble favor for my sister.,nugznhugz,88,11,9,"Hey there Reddit! I was wondering if you guys would want to put your best foot forward and donate to help keep Brianna at home and help with Brianna’s Home Makeover? This is going to be a long post I know



So my sister is the most amazing person I met. She is the very definition of a warrior. When she was 10 she was diagnosed with a rare vanishing bone disease. How rare do you say? Well so far only 200 cases are known to man, she always complained of a neck/collar bone pain. One night after her basketball game the pain was unbearable so my father massaged her shoulders. Upon doing so he found that she was missing a collar bone. They raced my sister to the ER and stayed there until early morning with no information as to what was going on inside my sisters body. Doctors were at a loss for words. The only thing they could do was to send Brianna to a specialist in Dallas. (6 hours from our hometown) So we hoped in the car and proceeded to have a “quick vacation’ as my parents called it. (Mind you I was 6 and my sister was 10 so I was very oblivious as to what was going on) The doctors in Dallas diagnosed Brianna with Gorhams Disease, gave her 2 years to live, and sent her to another specialist in Chicago.



Let’s fast forward 14 YEARS. My sister is now quadriplegic , and her body is full of steel rods. That’s the jiff of it. My sister began being “home-schooled” by the time HS came around. At the end of her Senior year she graduated with HONORS, and a special ceremony was held for her at the nursing home she was staying at. The whole school/community was in attendance for the event. Fast forward a few more years to Briannas 21st birthday. This is an awesome milestone right? Wrong. In the state of Texas Brianna is no longer considered a child, and her insurance money that keeps her at home would run out. Our Aunt “Pattie” threw out the idea that we have a fundraiser and set Brianna up a trust fund. In October of 2009 we launched “Bri’s Buddies” and held our first fundraiser “Bri’s Walk”. Since then we have had many more fundraisers to keep Bri’s’ trust filled. Hoorayy!!



Fast forward to the present day. My sister was always told she could do anything but with her sickness one thing that wasn’t on that list was living alone/having her own place. The same thing every young adult dreams about. Right now we’re in our 10th day of construction . Plumbing has been laid, I see ya’ll helping out people in need all the time. Donate money for a direct cause; keeping Brianna at home. HER HOME. My family doesn’t come from money at all. We do what we can to survive. If there ever comes a time where my family cannot pay to keep my sister at home the only option is to send her to live in a nursing home. How would you like to be 23, quadriplegic, and living with your friends’ grandparents? I know I wouldn’t.



My sister has never once complained about her life, I ask a humble favor. Spare a dollar or two and make my sister the happiest girl in the world.

She deserves it!


TL;DR My sister is terminally ill

Today Geoff and I met real angels on earth. Here is the story:


I am working with a family which needed 2 twin beds for their children. The children had no beds and were sleeping with their mom. When first I met with her all she wanted was for the kids to have their own beds

I worked to get the beds donated and got funds to pay for new mattresses and box springs. I discovered that I could get brand new beds
I contacted their customer service personnel for the South Philly store and secured directions on how to use an organization check and get the tax removed. 

Armed with all my documents and specific instructions on where to go to make the transaction
The two little ones 6 and 9 were waiting for us to bring their first beds ever at 3:30pm after school.


When we arrived

 He was talking to someone on his phone as I discussed the family situation with Geoff


What we didn't realize was a customer was listening carefully to the story and stood up

I composed myself as did Geoff and said that I would accept their kindness if the woman would give me her contact information so I could return the money via an agency check next week. She was hesitant but agreed to the arrangement. The manager also arranged a coupon that would cover the tax so the final charge would not include the tax.

1367634663.0,1dnplg,"Pregnant, Lonely, Depressed, Lost, No One to Talk to,nillajenn,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/1dnplg/pregnant_lonely_depressed_lost_no_one_to_talk_to/, where I am

1.  I am lonely.  My two friends moved out of state this year and my baby's father (casual boyfriend) travels for work and I only get to see him about 7 days out of the month.  when he is in town he is very busy taking care of things that need his attention because he is never in town (DMV, etc..)

2.  I cannot return to work until I can travel out of town by myself which will likely be in a decade.  My career is too travel and time astringent to be a mother.  My job requires travel for 3-7 weeks at a time and international travel.  Lack of income also plays a part here too...  This career is not at all conducive to having a child

3.  My ex divorced me because he was unhappy with our sex life and sought other partners


4.  I live in Las Vegas and do not enjoy it at all.  I am not a drinker or partier and it is hard to meet people who aren't completely flaky or transient.  I have made such an effort to make friends and over the years managed to make a few but as I mentioned before (I think) they moved away this year.

5.  My boyfriend is a photographer that has quit taking pictures because he thinks I am too miserable to have my pictures taken.  I don't reject taking pictures but I am honest when I don't like the result and I never do.  My hair is disgusting looking (I quit bleaching it blonde

AND I HAVE AN AWFUL AWFUL STAINED FRONT TOOTH.  It is a porcelain that was supposed to be temporary.  I got it on discount while in college because m tooth broke and the dentist got the color completely wrong.  I don't ever smile because of it and I just realized that I haven't smiled properly for almost 10 years.  This is also why I don't like my pictures.  All I see is a brown fake tooth in the front of my mouth.  I wonder if I will ever have pictures with people I love while smiling genuinely instead of always being so self conscious and afraid of the outcome of the picture.  I avoid being happy because of it.   

Not only does the tooth prevent me from taking pictures but it also makes me afraid to be happy.  

I LITERALLY FEEL EMBARRASSED TO BE HAPPY.  I have an overwhelming shame and guilt when I get tinges of excitement in my life.  For some reason I always feel like being surprised or excited is showing weakness or stupidity.  I don't THINK this


6.  I am/was an avid hobbyist and I have no space to work on anything.  My ex sold our home out from under me after he moved out and I was pressured to vacate with very little notice.  I had to throw away more than three quarters of everything I had ever owned and move into a storage unit.  Now I am in my boyfriends house by myself all the time with no place to unpack anything and no resources to get some sort of space for myself.

7.  I am also suffering from general discontent over my pregnant body

8.  My boyfriend and I have a less than ideal relationship - one obvious component being his excessive absence.  Him and I are just really different and are not often ""on the same page"".  We both like to be romanced with our confirmation of being cared for being derived from the other person doing the ""romancing""  we are usually dead in the water when spending time together - both of us sitting in silence waiting for the other one to be affectionate.  We love each other but find it very difficult to be ""in love"".

9.  I used to be so confident and happy with myself.  When I was a stay at home mom with my son I made various things and took a lot of pride in it. I remember being happy and confident - and (bear with me) I am ashamed to be ashamed to be happy.  Knowing how I used to be confident and how much everyone around me enjoyed makes feeling like I do even worse.  There are a lot of irreversible factors involved now so I don't have a clear cut plan of how to be happy again.

10.  I am so afraid this will affect my soon to be born.  I am afraid of the depression getting unreasonable and out of control once she arrives.  I'm afraid of losing her and everything else because I cannot be happy.  

I feel like I am on the path of the dead.  I am just stumbling down the line between cradle and coffin with nothing but a heavy distorted silence consuming me.  I have mentioned these problems to my doctor and she doesn't want to refer me to a psychiatrist/psychologist right now (unless I were a danger to myself or the baby) as it would be part of my medical record and I may be treated differently/poorly if we jump the gun and put it in writing.  She has given me the option but together we decided to wait until there were more warning flags.

I cannot get out of bed (I do - there are some things that do not wait, support, laughter, etc...  

I want to feel better about myself.  Physically and emotionally.

I know the people who are still ""in my life"" (my boyfriend and unborn) are relying on me to be happier and to come out of this but I am even more frightened and depressed by this prospect.

I have no contact with my family

tl;dr  I have no emotioanl support, my friends moved out of state, my ex divorced me and took custody of my 5 year old son via legal trickery, my ex sold my home from underneath me, I had to leave behind/dispose of almost everything I owned, I cannot continue my career because of the baby, I have a disgusting tooth that has prevented me from smiling for over 10 years

Spoke with doctor and my situation isn't a threat to me or the baby physically but she is aware of how I feel.  She doesn't want to jump the gun by ""labeling me"" as unstable on my medical record as I am aware of myself and my actions.

1352482364.0,12x6xq,You guys are doing it! My friend with ICS (Interstitial Cystitis) is already at $263 of her $5000 goal to cover medical expenses! Help me think of other ways to garner attention to this small cause!,mediocre_meme,97,22,7,"This was the original post:

This is from [her donation site](http://www.giveforward.com/heidipumpkinpiefund):

&gt;This fund will be used to pay off the large sum of medical bills I have that insurance refused to cover for my final I.C. diagnosis.


&gt;2.5 years ago I started having chronic pain everyday. Doctor after doctor would tell me nothing was wrong and send me to another doctor or specialist. Test after test would show nothing was wrong and would result in more tests. I finally found a doctor willing to listen that this was not all in my head and he did 2 final tests and diagnosed me with Interstitial Cystitis. If you are unfamiliar, diet, and physical therapy, I have been living pain free since September 12, 2012!

&gt;The medical bills have been the biggest point of stress in my life. I pay them on time every month and always pay as much as possible on them, those bills are now totaling in the $10,000 range. I hate to ask for anything, and I don't want to ask for much, but I would genuinely appreciate your donation to making a headway towards not having these medical bills drown me anymore. I hope that one day, some day, somehow I can repay your kindness. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

&gt;I also hope that this will raise awareness for Interstitial Cystitis patients everywhere. It's a traumatizing experience to go through and extremely painful days and nights without sleep sometimes

As I said

Thanks again

Everybody who gives something here, selfishness, and greed you all come here to stick out the helping hand.

My one hope for this subreddit is to see this community unify to an even greater extent.

When we ask you about things you want, I want to see 100 replies and 1,000 upvotes.

I want to see the ideas the community really feels strongly about being brought up without provocation by us Mods.

They say there's nothing in this world worse than wasted talent. We have generosity

So what's stopping us?

On one hand, really want it.

So this is what I propose. Don't be afraid to make [RK] threads and talk about the state of the subreddit. We can't help if we don't know what people want/expect.

Even if you personally have no desire to fulfill a request, or other subreddits they can use to find the help they're looking for.

We have 5 Moderators here that would love to hear private feedback should you not wish to create a public thread. Use us to bounce ideas off of.

That is my cake-day wish.

1354759084.0,14cxke,[RK] Announcing the RandomKindness Holiday Give-Away!,Avien,85,15,44,"Happy Holidays RK!

To celebrate we're announcing the RandomKindness Holiday Give-Away!

This event will function exactly like our 10k and Halloween Give Aways only this time we hope to get more people to give away presents!

**Date and/or Timing**

* The List of Gifts will go up **December 25th** at 4pm U.S. Eastern Time
* If you disagree with the time of the Give-away

Place | Time | Time Zone
:--|:--|:--
U.S.A. - New York | Tuesday
|U.S.A. - Texas (Midland) | Tuesday
San Francisco (U.S.A. - California) | Tuesday
Anchorage (U.S.A. - Alaska) | Tuesday
London (United Kingdom - England) | Tuesday
Sydney (Australia - New South Wales) | Wednesday

**How to sign up to OFFER:**

* Send me (Avien) a **[Private Message](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Avien)** if you would like to Offer
* Mention 'Give-away' in the Title
* Tell me the state or country you live in (for time zone conflicts)
* Say what you would be willing to OFFER
* Say if you would be willing to ship to a different country
* **Multiple Offers:** If you sign up to OFFER
* Upon receiving your PM

**What you can give:**

* Anything!
* In the past we had people offering, board games, books, homemade pottery, homemade jewelry, food, clothes

**How to claim a gift:**

* On December 25th at 4pm EST

* The giver's name will be hyperlinked. Upon clicking said name

* **Multiple Requests:** I can not enforce 'first-come-first-served' so I will leave it up to the giver to decide who they want to give their OFFER to (normal RK Offering procedure).

**Giver Instructions:**

* To avoid as much confusion as possible I ask that each Giver both **a)** Confirms with the recipient that they will get said gift and **b)** PM me back saying that your Offer has been taken **and who has taken it**. This will allow me to 'strike-through' the offer. Thus minimizing the amount of duplicate requests you get for the already fulfilled gift. While also allowing me to keep track of who has received gifts.

* **Sending Gifts:** **DO NOT** send gifts immediately. The way the contest is currently built

* **Fair warning to Givers:** Please check out the person you plan on giving to. Please be wary of members with 1 Link 0 Comment karma made on accounts between now and the date of the Gift-Away (0-3 days). Check their comment histories to see if they're active in RandomKindness. Or if they applied for RK Flair.


**Gift-away Rules:**

* **Only one gift per person:** This gift-away will function on the honor system. However

* **If you receive two gifts on accident:** If you make multiple requests and realize you have been given two gifts

* **Scamming:** Seriously

**Incentives to be a Holiday Giver:**

* To give some holiday cheer on the nicest day of the year
* Bring web traffic to our community
* Special red and Green Holiday Medal (**Note:** Halloween Givers *WILL* receive their medals as well

Well I think that's everything! Please help by upvoting this post

So after a year of financial collapse etc we found ourselves slightly worse off than we were last year. We couldn't even afford to see our friends' newborn baby

Here's a picture of all the awesome stuff I got:

http://i.imgur.com/yncTC.jpg

Seriously

Let me tell you about some of the things!

**reddit alien in a tardis** - An awesome picture by frcanadawelsh with a card lamenting her lack of money to buy things with and having to resort to making things! Guys

**the mysterious redditor** - Well! Someone aroused my suspicions by arriving at the door with a package but no uniform on Monday. Inside that package turned out to be a hamper (even the basket is awesome) full of awesome retro sweets and awesome kitty treats for my awesome kitties and the other kitty. Teasing :3 THEY ARE ALL MONSTERS.

This mystery redditor was given away, we don't know who it really was, but then again that is probably the point :)

Thank you mystery redditor! I'm slightly glad I buggered up my signature!

**a fiver** - I'm saving the best story for last. You see

On that day I had been worried because I couldn't justify the expense of even cooperating fully in the Secret Santa at the office; a £5 expense that everyone should be able to cover. And just in time a little angel sent me exactly the required moolah to do that. So I did go unto Morrisons

You see, though, I felt I had nailed it with the ice cream cake idea. 

Nailed it perfectly! When the presents were opened after dinner, home-made gift, but just the right gift, turned me from my normal miserable self into a fun and happy man for a night. I even danced! In front of my workmates! I do so love to make people happy.

So thank you especially to strawberrylime

And thank you to everyone who participated; even the words inside the cards have helped lift my spirits this year. Thank you Jess for calling me a demigod -- I wouldn't call my clumsy flailings at walls ""parkour"" but thanks all the same. Thanks to the various people who are under the shared delusion that I am a great guy. Thanks to whoever's in Maine for making me jump with a noisy card (I'd forgotten they existed!). Thanks to everyone

Thanks for waiting for it.

This is hard to talk about
  
  
I'm a stay-at-home mom of 2 kids and pregnant with baby #3
  

Until this Monday, in tiny pieces, I just lost it. I confronted him and he admitted it, there was no way he could deny it with the proof my sister had. I kicked him out, I couldn't even look at him anymore. I felt like I didn't know him and that is terrifying, it's given me so much anxiety.  
  
My sister called the police. He lost his job and he's probably going to prison for a long time. I don't have a job
  
Anyways
  

The only problem is I've stalled on getting stuff for the baby. I was going to see what I could get 2nd hand from people and then purchase the rest in the next month or two. I did get some stuff already like a swing, I will be able to breathe a little easier.
  

I've made a list of the things I need. LET ME SAY I WILL ALSO GLADLY ACCEPT 2ND HAND DONATIONS OF THESE SAME ITEMS, I just want something. It will help me out so much and I promise if and when I do get back on my feet I promise I will return the favor to someone else on this board. Wow, I just realized how much I typed and I'm sorry! I guess I was just venting. Here is the link, like I said it's a list of what I need but if anyone has any used items it would be appreciated too: http://amzn.com/w/9HA0CHQIW2OG

Dan has a blood disease that has evaded diagnosis. The cause is unknown, until his insurance reached the maximum allowable benefit. I don't know the exact details, but I do know there is a 60 day period where he can not afford treatment, and is not covered by any insurance. So, he is not able to get treatment.

I saw him last week

What I am asking is a few things:
1. If you live in the Charlotte NC area, and having his business do a bit better would probably help take a load off. They also are a lot cheaper than the dealerships (at least for Mercedes), and do as good or better quality work.
2. If you are able and feel so inclined
3. If you feel so inclined, owns his own business, and because he got sick is unable to afford health insurance. The health insurance system is failing this middle class guy, and endangering his life.

I wish I could help this guy out, as well as write my local paper hoping that they carry the story.

Also

Good luck everyone!

**Update #2:** I've received a lot of feedback from the members and I believe pushing the Gift-Away back to Friday will give everyone ample enough time to consider giving and requesting.  And with 30+ people gifting over 100+ gifts

**Update:** We are nearing 10, it could be 2 days.

---

RandomKindness has reached almost 10

To celebrate this small yet significant milestone

However, we thought it would be a kind gesture to open it up and allow anyone to sign up for the gift-giving bonanza!

I think it would be a nice surprise if we spent the next day or two signing members up

That way

**Date and/or Timing**

* Hopefully we'll hit 10
* **Please comment below expressing interest or concern for a static day to celebrate reaching 10k subscribers** (I may just chose a day depending on member opinion)

**How to sign up to OFFER:**

* Send me (Avien) a **[Private Message](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Avien)** if you would like to Offer
* Mention 'Gift-away' in the Title
* Say what you would be willing to OFFER
* **Multiple Offers:** If you sign up to OFFER
* Upon receiving your PM

**How to claim a gift:**

* On the day we hit 10, I will create a new thread listing all the OFFERS under each giver's name

* The giver's name will be hyperlinked. Upon clicking said name

* **Multiple Requests:** I can not enforce 'first-come-first-served' so I will leave it up to the giver to decide who they want to give their OFFER to (normal RK Offering procedure).

**Giver Instructions:**

* To avoid as much confusion as possible I ask that each Giver both **a)** Confirms with the recipient that they will get said gift and **b)** PM me back saying that your Offer has been taken **and who has taken it**. This will allow me to 'strike-through' the offer. Thus minimizing the amount of duplicate requests you get for the already fulfilled gift. While also allowing me to keep track of who has received gifts.

* **Sending Gifts:** **DO NOT** send gifts immediately. The way the contest is currently built

* **Fair warning to Givers:** Please check out the person you plan on giving to. Please be wary of members with 1 Link 0 Comment karma made on accounts between now and the date of the Gift-Away (0-3 days). Check their comment histories to see if they're active in RandomKindness. Or if they applied for RK Flair.


**Gift-away Rules:**

* **Only one gift per person:** This gift-away will function on the honor system. However

* **If you receive two gifts on accident:** If you make multiple requests and realize you have been given two gifts

* **Scamming:** Seriously

**Incentives to be a 10k Gifter:**

* Help revitalize the RK Community
* My first-born child
* Custom Flair of some sort. We're working out the feasibility of a new medal or perhaps some simple text '10k Giver'
* Because all the cool kids are doing it (Special RK appearance by everyone's favorite helper: [Glinda_da_Good_Witch](http://www.reddit.com/user/Glinda_da_Good_Witch/) and the Steam Lord: [Briguy9876](http://www.reddit.com/user/Briguy9876). As well as myself

Lisa is now 21 and has two kids. She has had her share of hard knocks but remains a good kid who adores her children. She has had intermittent contact with her biological mother (I'll call her Bitch) who is pretty much evil. Bitch tries to convince Lisa that she is a bad daughter

Lisa holds onto hope that her mother will change and that she will eventually love Lisa. Unfortunately this is really common with foster kids - the hope that if they are just good enough

Fast forward to now - Bitch had surgery last week and convinced Lisa to come take care of her while she was recuperating. In short order she started pulling her usual shit - screaming at Lisa

Lisa is stuck in Syracuse with a 3-month old and a 3-year with no car and almost no money. Even if I could send bus tickets she has too much stuff (car seats

I know this is totally unlikely but if anyone was coming from Syracuse to anywhere near my town (even 20-30 miles away

Details: I moved away from my family but I did not anticipate just how much my nieces would miss me. This is sorta one of those ""you don't miss it until it's gone"" deal. One of my sisters is paying for her kid to come see me (she arrives on Saturday with my parents for a week-long visit!!!) but my other sister doesn't quite have her life on track and can't (I think it's really ""won't"" but that's a whole 'nother story) pay for her kid to fly out. This niece has been begging for months for me to fly back home but I just can't afford it.

**SOME INFORMATION ON OUR FAMILY** and mainly why ""just working more"" isn't an option at this point and time.





My parents have 4 children in all, and they're all going through their stuff right now to see if there's anything they can sell on craigslist to contribute.




My mom has fibromyalgia, but because of where hers are they are incredibly painful, and because they are so close to her spinal cord surgery is not recommended by any of the surgeons she's seen, and they've all refused doing it themself).  She's in constant pain and already has a hard enough time working 40 hours a week, she wants to go an disability but it would not make enough money to live if she did.





My dad works full time, but most times he does more, especially on his short weeks).  He tore a ligament in his leg some years ago which still affects his walking a bit (it was down towards his ankle, but I forget the specifics) and working any more than he does is dangerous for his health from lack of sleep and over exhaustion from the job.






I live 2 hours away with my fiance, I already have a job lined up near my parents house with my old employer (she jumped at the opportunity to have me back) working longer shifts with the days all together, so that I can stay with my parents during the days I work and head home with my fiance on the days that I don't.  This is honestly the best option for me, because I've had experience with this job I'm making more there than I would anywhere else that I'm qualified for pre-license, and since I'm the top salesgirl I usually jump to most non-manager hours whenever a shift is made.  But I can't start working for a few more weeks, and we're hoping he doesn't have to wait that long.





My fiance is the most amazing man I have ever met, and he's also going through our stuff trying to find extra's we can sell on craigslist.

I work at a local child psychiatric facility which treats kids from age 7(ish) to 18. These kids tend to come from very low socioeconomic classes and aren't used to being given a second thought, rape, ect., so, despite their age, most of them haven't had anything that could be considered a childhood.

It used to be the case that the state would be able to give the kids what most children grow up with--non-second hand toys, as staff, can do for them outside of the therapy they're there for.

So, art supplies--anything that a child could use--please send them. The place is called the Child Study and Treatment Center and is located in Lakewood, WA.

This is why I have come to you fine folks.  My son's school is doing a fundraiser with Innisbrook.  They are selling things like wrapping paper, gifts, cookie mixes, etc.  The kicker is that the top selling students at his school will receive a ride in a limo and a pizza party for their class.  They also earn prizes from Innisbrook as well.  If he sells 85 items he will get a Lenovo tablet.  My absolute dream would be seeing his name in the school bulletin and that he might hear his name over the loudspeaker during morning announcements.  It would boost his self esteem and also help to mend his reputation with other students and some of the staff.  It would be nice if he was recognized for something positive instead of the negative.

Regarding web design/development: I will teach you even if you have no prior experience at all in web design/development

Regarding programming: I have worked with quite a few programming languages, C# and (for web) PHP/Javascript. If you're a beginner or have never programmed before, I can help you with all of these. Even if you're working with another language and are struggling on some basic concepts, chances are I can help you. If you're an intermediate programmer, then I assume you can pretty much Google everything you need anyway. Please don't contact me if you want to learn a significant amount of any language other than PHP. I consider myself qualified to help you with the basics, but I don't use those languages enough to be an ""expert"" programmer.

Regarding Photoshop: I went through a rather bad episode of depression about 2 years back and deleted/destroyed all my digital art + backups,then I can help you out.

**Requirements:** 

* You need to have Skype (it's a free download and free account creation), but I frequently chat with friends in the US, and getting up a little early or staying up a little late isn't a problem for me. I'm sure we can work something out. I've taught over 45 people in the US so far, ranging from the east coast to the west, and it's not been an issue.

* You need to speak decent English. I'm not asking for a BA in English Literature, will be much easier if we can understand each other easily.

* You need to be motivated enough to practice a little on your own. The learning process will go a lot better if, just messing around with stuff. Honestly, the vast majority of *good* IT professionals got their start by fiddling around with their computer despite not knowing what might happen.

* You have to WANT to LEARN: I have 60+ ""students"" on my contact list, because I've had unanimously positive reviews so far. Some people have given me reasons for why they're busy at the moment and can't take classes, and I'm perfectly okay with that, but please don't just add me on a whim. Good design/programming takes mental effort, and the least you can do in exchange for free classes is to be committed to learning.

**If you're interested

You can find out a bit more about me from my [website](http://www.rohitnair.net)

Please don't ask me if I have room for more! Just post here and send me a PM with your Skype name. I will do my best to find time for you! I have people spread across a bunch of different time zones, you're sure to get a slot.

Test after test would show nothing was wrong and would result in more tests. I finally found a doctor willing to listen that this was not all in my head and he did 2 final tests and diagnosed me with Interstitial Cystitis. If you are unfamiliar, diet, and physical therapy, I have been living pain free since September 12, 2012!

A good friend of mine draws the webcomic 'Goblins.' It's a great comic about a bunch of Goblins that get sick of being the lowest monsters on the AD&amp;D totem pole and decide to become adventurers. It pokes fun at fantasy, and it is really a labor of love for the guy. He gets a good number of hits to his site (40k/day) but the guy thinks that it's impolite at best and absolutely abhorrent at worst to ask his fans to donate to him.

He pays for the comic by creating a sub-comic called 'Tempts Fate' that works on the premise of putting a character in dangerous situations that will only be completed if certain economic goals are met (eg - The windmill of swords will kill Tempts if the 1500$ goal is not reached). The guy is supporting his family on the comic

Do you guys have any advice for what could help him get out of this situation? Real solutions and out of the box thinking would be really great here.  You can check out the comic at: [Goblins Comic](http://goblinscomic.com) I am in no way affiliated with him (other than being a friend)

I'm a nerd who loves teaching. Over the years, I still know enough about a lot of other topics to teach beginners. For more info and my ""portfolio"", check out my [website](http://www.rohitnair.net).

**What I offer:**

One on one classes over Skype that will provide you with strong fundamentals in any of the topics I offer

* Graphics: Photoshop
* Web design: HTML
* Programming: PHP/MySQL, Java. 

For C, and will not focus too heavily on language specific features. If you wish to focus on a specific aspect i.e game development, mobile app development, etc, you're on your own.

**Requirements:** 

* You have to *want* to **learn**. This means you have to understand and accept that people spend their entire lives trying to master these technologies, around 50 of them never even had a *single class*. A couple dozen never even confirmed the Skype contact add request. Do not be one of these people.
* You need to have Skype (it's a free download and free account creation), but I frequently chat with friends in the US, and getting up a little early or staying up a little late isn't a problem for me. I'm sure we can work something out. I've taught many people in the US so far, ranging from the east coast to the west, and it's not been an issue.
* You need to speak decent English. I'm not asking for a Bachelor's in English Literature, will be much easier if we can understand each other easily.

Hello RandomKindness

The Mods at RandomKindness would like to reemphasize the notion of adding people you donate to [The Reddit Giver's List](http://sdorm.org/redditgivers).

This gives our members (and the members of other subreddits specializing in the act of giving) a useful way to log the donations made to users who request in our respective communities.

Just because a name ends up on this list **does not mean the people on there are abusing the system**

We all value honesty and helping those less fortunate than ourselves. Unfortunately we can't help everyone and sometimes this comes down to determining who needs your help more. **That is why this list is valuable. It helps us all better determine who could use the help more and who could use it less.**

We also can't easily tell who is lying

Reporting people you donate to is one thing you can do to protect yourself and maintain a level of honesty in this subreddit.

Another thing you can do is to check the person out:

* How long has the requester been a member?
* Does he/she have comments outside of those in RK?
* Does his/her comments sound like a poor mother who can't afford presents for her children? Or
* Ask them **via PM** to provide further information about themselves.^1 

1.Disclaimer: *People requesting

**Yet

You can be as skeptical or as trusting as you'd like

In an ideal world there wouldn't be scammers and liers but this is the Internet we're talking about here. It's impossible to keep people from abusing a good system

Anyways

There's always going to be a couple bad eggs

Let Damian walk for graduation in male cap and gown.

Hi

St. Pius High School administration is refusing to recognize Damian's gender identity, and family know Damian as a male. The administration says that because he has ""female"" marked on his birth certificate -- despite the fact that he is now legally Damian and not Brandi -- he still must walk in a girl's cap and gown for graduation. 

That's why I signed a petition to Barbara Rothweiler, https://www.saintpiusx.com/, which says:

""Let Damian Garcia walk in a boy's black cap and gown for St. Pius' graduation on Wednesday

We will be having a small give away to celebarate this holiday. Please feel free to give anything whether it be Halloween related or not.

**Time &amp; Date**

* Wednesday

* **Please comment below expressing interest or concern to celebrate the Halloween Give Away**

**How to sign up to OFFER:**

* You can start signing up starting today until the day before the give away (Oct. 30)
* Send me (SirLlama) a **[Private Message](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=SirLlama)** if you would like to Offer
* Mention 'Gift-away' in the Title
* Say what you would be willing to OFFER
* **Multiple Offers:** If you sign up to OFFER
* Upon receiving your PM

**How to claim a gift:**

* On the day of Halloween

* The giver's name will be hyperlinked. Upon clicking said name

* **Multiple Requests:** I can not enforce 'first-come-first-served' so I will leave it up to the giver to decide who they want to give their OFFER to (normal RK Offering procedure).

**Giver Instructions:**

* To avoid as much confusion as possible I ask that each Giver both **a)** Confirms with the recipient that they will get said gift and **b)** PM me back saying that your Offer has been taken **and who has taken it**. This will allow me to 'strike-through' the offer. Thus minimizing the amount of duplicate requests you get for the already fulfilled gift. While also allowing me to keep track of who has received gifts.

* **Sending Gifts:** **DO NOT** send gifts immediately. The way the contest is currently built

* **Fair warning to Givers:** Please check out the person you plan on giving to. Please be wary of members with 1 Link 0 Comment karma made on accounts between now and the date of the Gift-Away (0-3 days). Check their comment histories to see if they're active in RandomKindness. Or if they applied for RK Flair.


**Gift-away Rules:**

* **Only one gift per person:** This gift-away will function on the honor system. However

* **If you receive two gifts on accident:** If you make multiple requests and realize you have been given two gifts

* **Scamming:** Seriously

Well I think that's everything! Please help by upvoting this post

I have been with my husband for 16 years. He is 34 I am 38. Even though I have a BA and some post grad work completed I stay at home with the kids and he works as a waiter in a nice restaurant (was in construction but then the recession).

 He has complete control of the finances--and there is never any money for the bills or food or the kids and I have borrow everything I can from my family to make up for it. On top of this

He has had a history of criminal behavior and violence and emotional abuse toward me but only one isolated incident of physical violence in 2000 associated with alcohol and drugs.  Since then he has had anger management issues and has been emotionally abusive but seemed to have some control while he was clean and sober. He worked on his career and was a good father and was in therapy and growing into a better person. There was always growth even when it wasn't perfect.

About a year ago, and other sundry pills. This rolled into alcohol, and finally cocaine. I threatened to leave. I went to a DV shelter for help in November. I the last three months he has started getting physical--spitting at me, grabbing me, twisting my arms, leaving bruises but never punching me.   They gave me therapy (group and individual) but nothing else since its not extremely physical and the waiting list for a shelter is 6 months for a family my size. He went to rehab in January after a psychotic reaction to the cocaine (he thought people were after him.). Things got better. We got a great counselor that gave him tools to work with his problems. He goes to AA. He seems committed to the process. I let my guard down and felt like things would be OK. He relapsed again the night before Easter and grabbed me by my shirt and threw me into the TV at three in the morning in front of our son. So it started up again. 

I called the counselor and told him what happened. He threatened to call CPS if I don't leave him now. I have no resources. None. I have no bank accounts. He keeps my ATM card. The cars are in his name. I don't have a key to the front door of the apartment

I want to comply with the counselor. I will not allow him to lose our kids with his assfuckery. Unfortunately

I need a job

My degree is in English. My MA is ABT. I have an emergency teacher's credential. I have worked as a technical writer, copy editor, typesetter (all one job), marketing rep. for a book seller and taught high school (there are no jobs for me with my degree). I have good front office skills, data entry, bookkeeping, and DB management. I can even do a little IT, I'll clean toilets or cuddle corpses. I just need an income. I will work hard and do just about anything. 

I hope this was the right place to post. Sorry for the wall. I have another account but am using this one because it has identifying info and don't need anyone else calling CPS

TL;DR  Woman married 16 years with college degree and skills but out of work force for a while in desperate need of job after husband picked up a  drug habit

**Requirements:** 

* You need to have Skype (it's a free download and free account creation), but I frequently chat with friends in the US, and getting up a little early or staying up a little late isn't a problem for me. I'm sure we can work something out. I've taught over 20 people in the US so far, ranging from the east coast to the west, and it's not been an issue.

* You need to speak decent English. I'm not asking for a BA in English Literature, will be much easier if we can understand each other easily.

* You need to be motivated enough to practice a little on your own. The learning process will go a lot better if, just messing around with stuff. Honestly, the vast majority of *good* IT professionals got their start by fiddling around with their computer despite not knowing what might happen.

* You have to WANT to LEARN: I have 50+ ""students"" on my contact list, because I've had unanimously positive reviews so far. Some people have given me reasons for why they're busy at the moment and can't take classes, and I'm perfectly okay with that, but please don't just add me on a whim. Good design/programming takes mental effort, and the least you can do in exchange for free classes is to be committed to learning.

**If you're interested

Please don't ask me if I have room for more! Just post here and send me a PM with your Skype name. I will do my best to find time for you! I have people spread across a bunch of different time zones, you're sure to get a slot.

I used to be actively involved in /r/playitforward but I decided to open up my giving to all of reddit.  Please read on

----

First

1. My story began back in September 2011 when I acquired 300 DX:HR steam keys that I [tried to trade](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/lh3xs/h_deus_ex_human_revolution_300_copies_steam_w_any/) over in gameswap.
2. Things went south really fast when [my plan backfired](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/ln84v/h_an_apology_w_your_forgiveness_understanding_and/).
3. Eventually after everything died down
4. Over the next year

------------


So why the spread to all of reddit?

The biggest problem I had in all of this was vetting everyone.  Who should get games, I found that following proper /r/playitforward procedure was getting to be too much of a chore.

Now

------

First, I do these 'events' several times before moving on to my next idea.  Rest assured, unless you are living under a rock, you will NOT miss it! 

Here is what happens in this giveaway:

* Join my [steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/redditgiveaway/)
* Enter chat room **whenever there is an announcement** that indicates the game is starting (This will happen many times over the course of a few months).  It will be at a random time to give everyone a chance at participating. (The announcement should pop up in your steam so you will not miss it if you are online and have joined the group)
* Once you are in group chat
* When it is your turn
* Depending on your behavior, respect towards fellow players, and difficulty of the adventure chosen, you will get a list of games from which you may choose one.
* The longer this event goes on

------------------

**Special Notes**

* Please read the steam group rules
* The prize list will constantly be modified as trades are made to increase the amount of games I have
* I have RL matters to attend to so the contest may abruptly end at any time.  Although I will try to keep it going for hour long increments.  Thanks for your understanding!
* Last and probably most important, and try to have **FUN**

**Location:** Fairfax

Almost 6 years ago I lost my younger brother to a car crash. During the time afterwards I spent a lot of time buying things

I'm looking to find a couple kids who otherwise wouldn't get a real [*insert personal seasonal holiday here*]. My plan is to ship the items to the parents and let them wrap the gifts for the kids ""From Santa"" or whoever your choice of benevolent gift giver may be

I'll be picking a couple families with a goal to start mailing items right before Thanksgiving (US). Please be ready to provide verification if selected. What I would like is the follow:

* **Your situation:** Just a quick brief idea. 
* **Are you okay with opened items?** I have some action figures and toys that were opened and displayed
* **Preferences:** Are there items you do not want your child having, etc. I don't want to send you something you disapprove of.
* **Child Gender:** Gender will have no bearing on the gifts, like a Amidala/Leia dress up items. If you have a girl, or even a boy that likes those sorts of things let me know.
* **Age:** I don't need the exact age just an idea. I don't want to send toys for kids 10+ to a toddler
* **Pet Allergies?** These items are currently being stored in an extra room in our apartment. We have two cats

For those curious about why I'd want to do this its pretty straight forward. I've had periods in my life where money was short

I only ask that others pay forward any kindness I offer them.

**Edit:** Proof that I have the toys

For those suggesting or wondering why I'm not just using a well known charity I'm doing this for the reddit community. I've been here 10 months and its my way to give back a bit to those who might need it. I'm also very picky about the charities I volunteer with or donate to and stick with only those that give the vast majority of their raised funds (90%+) to their programs.

1348845174.0,10mdev,"[Offer][WWW] I will teach you web design (HTML5/CSS3/JS), web development (PHP/MySQL), basic programming (C++/Java) or basic design/photo-editing (Photoshop/Illustrator) FOR FREE.",RHAINUR,50,32, I gave a few people free classes

Regarding web design/development: I will teach you even if you have no prior experience at all in web design/development

Regarding programming: I have worked with quite a few programming languages, C# and (for web) PHP and Javascript. If you're a beginner or have never programmed before, I can help you with all of these. Even if you're working with another language and are struggling on some basic concepts, chances are I can help you, as the basic concepts of programming are more or less the same across the commonly used programming languages. If you're an intermediate programmer, then I assume you can pretty much Google everything you need anyway. 

Regarding Photoshop: I went through a rather bad period of depression about 3 years back and deleted/destroyed nearly all of my digital art, then I can help you out.

**Requirements:** 

* You need to have Skype (it's a free download and free account creation)

* You need to speak decent English. I'm not asking for a BA in English Literature, will be much easier if we can understand each other easily.

* You need to be motivated enough to practice a little on your own. The learning process will go a lot better if, just messing around with stuff. Honestly, the vast majority of *good* IT professionals got their start by fiddling around with their computer despite not knowing what might happen.

* You have to WANT to LEARN: In the first round of classes, or just never came online. Some students told me when they were busy and could't take classes, and I'm perfectly okay with that, but please don't just add me on a whim. Good design/programming takes mental effort, and the least you can do in exchange for free classes is to be committed to learning.

**If you're interested

You can find out a bit more about me from my [website](http://www.rohitnair.net)

Please don't ask me if I have room for more! Just post here and send me a PM with your Skype name. I will do my best to find time for you! I have people spread across a bunch of different time zones, you're sure to get a slot.

Here is some of the feedback I received from the last round of classes: [awesome_endless](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/ow578/o/c3lffyu), [Bosca](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/ow578/o/c3lina3), [savesheep](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/ow578/o/c3lsj99), [Tanie](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/ow578/o/c3mbkrj), [leo986](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/ohveh/o/c3hmh2q), [oAngelFireo](http://www.reddit.com/r/randomacts/comments/ohvlm/i/c3hjlk9), [cogitoergognome](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/p8xt7/o/c3njajm), [FelixP](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/pqh9w/o/c3samss),self,

My mom is the greatest as I am sure most of yours are. She has been a rock my whole life especially when my father was diagnosed and died all within a month and a half. She works full time and serves voluntarily on boards in the area as well as does outreach for low-income families helping them with legal issues. She is the strongest woman I know. She has been through so much this past couple of months from her husband dying to her brother passing away 10 days ago. She deserves so much and I am asking anyone who would like to send her a mothers day card. I would love her to just start asking where on earth cards are coming from and be excited hearing kind words from random people out there in the world. Also if you want she loves Almond Roca candy if you want to put a little something with the card. I just want to make sure her first mothers day without her husband is one to help her heal. Thank you fellow Redditors I truly hope this happens for her.

The difficult part is that her bosses were giving her a very hard time about not always being able to come into work when she was in pain, but they did the next best thing. They put her on indefinite medical leave until she's 100% cured of a disease she'll have for the rest of her life. Her already relatively low pay is now cut in half and she has to do manual labor and odd jobs to be able to pay for bills, while in extreme pain most of the time. We already struggled enough, but this is just too much for anyone to deal with alone... She's too strong to ask for help, and she stays strong for me and my brother, but I can see how much she hurts and how much help she needs. I've been selling a lot of my video game collection, and my craigslist sales is the main reason we could pay rent this month. But I can't do it all when I can't work a full time job with school coming up, and we paid our rent. But we haven't had hot water in the month we've lived in our new house
  
  
  
  
  
**My Request**  
I can understand that many of you would be uncomfortable with sending a random teenager on the internet Paypal money just because he gave you a sad story. If you have any advice on how to verify my story please let me know and I'll do what I can. We of course need money to be able to pay the bills, and any other living expenses. But if you want to help in other ways that would be great too! Gift cards to places where we can buy food, books that my mom can read to help her through things, VHS movies (my mom LOVES movies, that's what she spends a lot of her free time doing is watching movies on her VCR), non-perishable food or coupons to get food. Or if you don't want to donate but would like to give an encouraging word to my mom, I can give you our address and you can write her a nice letter, or something like that. Anything and everything to help would be amazing... I just want her to know she isn't alone and doesn't have to go through this by herself. Thank you so much for listening to my story

But when I stumbled upon RandomKindness I was immediately drawn to a vibe our community gives off; which in essence is pure

Usually we reserve our wealth to give to those we care about

I'm not sure what the tally is for how many gifts the RK community has donated to its members and various charities

The members have and will always be the source of this community's strength. As the Mods of this community we feel it is our duty to give you the tools and information required to help you gift safely and kindly. You have the power to change one person's life. You have the power to help those who can not help themselves. And you have the power to make this community the most generous place in reddit!

However, if we're all focused on what we can get, rather than what we can give.

There will always be scammers and bullies, we should recognize these flaws and use them to motivate us to give more, to help more, to hope more! So that the greatness in us does not get out-shined by trivial issues.

I have faith that this community can be THE example of the empathetic and caring nature of human kind

So please RandomKindness, but be thankful for what we have in these uncertain times. Not just material things, but for family and friends and this community. I know we can't help everyone, but that doesn't mean we can't aspire to do just that.

Happy Holidays RandomKindness.

1355244672.0,14o6u2,[REQUEST] Help giving an amazing man the Christmas he deserves. Story inside.,samandstuff,62,25,48,"**EDIT: It was requested that I make an Amazon wishlist


Hello.


I have a bit of a long story


I am twenty-one years old and have been with the same man for almost two years. We're very young

Earlier this year, and didn't know what could have been wrong. We were terrified, but he was especially. I could see the fear in his eyes. I offered him the option to leave, but he didn't. He stayed, for me and for us, and things were great for a while. We got excited, we discussed names

At our five month ultrasound, especially. I raged, I cried, I made a mess, I barely did anything at work. And this lovely man, my love, didn't complain. He picked up after me, and kept his own emotions in check so I wouldn't have to worry about him. He was incredible.

We lost her when I was almost eight months along. It's been a little over a month since it happened. 

I took time off after it happened. I received some short term disability, is enough.

I want to give him the best Christmas I possibly can this year. I tell him time and time again how much I love him, but I want to do more. As much as I can for him. I know there are people that might deserve this more than we do and if you feel we aren't in need of your help, that's fine - but I can't tell you enough how much he deserves to be shown that not only do I think he's incredible, other people do too.

So, a big fan of asian cuisine and manly meat craft. He loves comic books, especially Batman and IDC - he's into Preacher right now but I'm not sure how far he is into the series. He likes most nerdy male pursuits - Doctor Who, Portal, etc. He used to be a pretty talented skateboarder before some ankle and knee injuries but he's looking to try and get into it again in the future. He enjoys dressing well - or at least, he would if we could afford it. I've seen him ogling ties and dress shirts in his desire to be ""fancy"", but he generally wears fitted jeans and clever t-shirts. No matter what, of any form - even if he's not the most talented at it. He's just.. in a nutshell.. great.

If you have any questions, or anything - please PM me or comment here. Thank you so much for consideration, help, and words. :)

* Please remember to upvote good posts
* Please make sure you keep your offer post updated
* Request are more likely to be fulfilled for used items than new/cash
* If the person you want to do something nice for turns out to be a dick
* Remember it feel better to give than to receive

**Post format:**

1. Start with one of these tags

 [OFFER]

 [REQUEST] (If you have a sad story which may get you more attention please be ready to provide a proof to somebody who is willing to offer or the Mods)
 
 [CHARITY] (any general request regarding a charity)

 [RK] (anything related to community but not actually an offer or request) 

2. Add second tag with location you are willing to sent to / receive. This should be from top to bottom i.e. UK then London
e.g. [US], NYC] , [FR, Paris], [US, KY], [UK

**Mods:**

So far we have a good number of enthusiastic people and I hope they are helpful. I am aware we have more people willing to do this. So in true RK fashion we will ask our current Mods in 2 weeks if they think they should give away modship as they can not contribute much. If somebody gives up we will have more mods.
For now it should be OK.

**Downvoting**

It is very un-kind of you to downvote somebody else's reply in an offer post. However for now we will not disable downvoting button and see how it goes. If it does not improve I will disable downvoting button in comments.

My son is turning 10 next Monday and, gas is insane and I go through a lot for therapy/specialist appointments, etc) these past twoish years, we just do not have the money for gifts or much of a celebration. He receives almost nothing from family for Xmas/birthdays. We stopped having parties as no child has ever shown up for a birthday party of his (heartbreaking).  He will really enjoy receiving a bunch of birthday wishes from all over and it will make his birthday extra special even if we cannot afford much! 

Jamie is my little trooper. He is autistic and has many syndromes and deficits that sometimes go along with being on the spectrum (motor skills deficits, executive function deficits, social skills deficits, generalized anxiety disorder, speech &amp; language deficits, Sensory Processing Disorder, etc, which he has rarely ever complained about!

He's dealt with a lot of consistent bullying since kindergarten. We finally had the board of ed agree to a school transfer, sometimes up to 10 hours weekly depending on if either (or both) boys have a specialist visit).  It looks like our youngest may end up with the same or similar diagnoses. 

He's just an awesome kid. He loves TF2, Wolf's Rain and MLP (yes, he's a Bronie and is so embarrassed that he won't admit it to anyone).  He makes rage comics (he knows what Reddit is but doesn't browse it) and builds awesome Halo Mega Bloks toymations.  He loves to watch terrible scary B movies with me.  He also loves Skrillex and could gem mine for hours on end.  He says he will have no problem becoming a CEO of a multi-billion dollar company (apparently, dentists don't make enough).  He's a great big brother, even when the baby is annoying him (he says his brother is the best thing that has happened in his life).  He's the type of person who would take the gift bags we made for his birthday party to the kids at school/therapy/social skills play group/therapeutic horseback riding group even though not a single one of them showed up to his birthday party...

He has come so far. Back when he was diagnosed, run without falling, write his name legibly (writing is still painful and tiring so he uses the school's laptop much of the time), zip, snap, button, etc. Now he's reading at a 6th grade level (he's in 4th), is trying hard to be able to tie his shoes (motor skills/executive function deficits make it extremely hard for him) and as soon as we can afford to get him a bike

Seriously

As more and more people join RK, and bad eggs have multiplied. RK is changing a lot from what it once was as we seek to accommodate more and more people.

But change is never inherently bad. It presents us the opportunity to learn

If you would like to be a Mod for RandomKindness we would give preference to those that meet the following requirements:

* Have extensive knowledge of CSS.

* Has experience moderating other subreddits or Forums

* Has been a member of RK for &gt;3 months. Or can sympathize with our goals and bring new ideas to the table.

* Demonstrates a professional

Hey guys. My friend called the other day and she was really upset because she has reached a point in her life where she feels like the road to her dream is coming to an end. She's been fighting through the BS of trying to make a living in the music industry for 8 years now - she has sacrificed a lot and worked extremely hard with nothing to show for it. She's met with executives at 2 major record labels that have both been impressed by her talents, contrary to popular belief), she's just passionate about performing - it's when I see her at her happiest. This video is from one of the many contests she's been a runner up in... she's never won a contest due to them all being decided by whoever gets the most friends to watch it (so they can boost ratings/traffic). I understand there are people fighting wars and there are people dying of unfortunate diseases who are more deserving than someone who wants to sing for a living. But, it would mean the world if I could at least make her feel appreciated. She's helped me get through hard times and has a good heart (not your typical music industry personality). I want to surprise her by having her see that lots of people have at least watched her perform. Thanks, Reddit! Oh, and sorry for it being Witney, I'm sure you've heard more than enough over the past week.. this was just one of her few recorded performances I could find. **TL;DR - Friend calls. She's upset and feels like a failure. Been trying to 'make it' in the music biz for 8 years with no luck. I want to make her feel appreciated by showing her that at least lots of people have seen her perform.

Throwaway account just incase. 

I was expelled from high school for a ""junior prank"" I did. My GPA was shit (2.6) and I had no aspirations to go to college. I moved to California when I was 17 after getting my GED and just worked for a year. Going to the beach, and long boarding for a whole year. Life was amazing. But then I had a HUGE realization: I hated my job and my life. I needed an education to get a career; not just a job. I needed to go back to school to live a life worthy of dying with.

Needless to say, both dream schools and back up easy schools. 

The letter came in the mail and I was accepted to Colorado State- Fort Collins. You have no idea the feeling that I had the moment I realized I made it into an actual university. That I'm actually smart enough to belong in a university. My Mom was so happy she teared up in the eyes. A moment I will remember for the rest of my life. But it gets better. 

My top choice school was the prestigious University of Rochester. I didn't think I had a chance to get in

I was taking a nap that afternoon after work, but this is the single greatest event in my life so far.

Now why do I need your help? Rochester is a private school with an estimated cost of attendance of 60

These kinds of things always get all kinds of response, tell me. I don't know. Tell me something funny or something. Just make me forget about my stupid problems for a little while. 

Whoever I pick gets a PSP Go (no games on it, but it's what I have to give), a docking station and HD connection wire to an HDTV, soft case, and the power cord/charger.

I'll pick someone in a few days after I wallow in Diablo 3 for a while. Will check in on the post pretty often and hopefully get some replies that make me feel like things are still ok and life is still enjoyable.

I like to just pretend everyone that tries for it will be the kind of person that isn't just doing it to get some free gear and doesn't really have any need or use for it

---------------------------------------------------------------------
**EDIT:** Wanted to thank everyone for their interest and support and advice. I actually did try to sell it to a game store and a pawn shop and both would only give me enough for barely even a small fraction of one months interest on the debt. I feel like i'd get more benefit emotionally from making someone else's day. Last time I sold off gaming stuff to a pawn shop for a shit price

I am not out living on the streets and am not starving. I have a good life. I definitely have my share of struggles as well. This debt is just weighing on me pretty hard as those of you in debt know how it does. It isn't an overly massive  debt, maybe there will be that day in a few more years where I get to go see the girl... Then again, right now it feels like I need to let it go, which i've been unable to do for the past 15 years, so that's going to be hard. lol.

I appreciate your stories and awesome encouraging thoughts. It really does lift my spirits to know there are good people out there with good intentions that care about others.

I will choose someone soon and get in contact with them. I really wish I could help everyone. I love RK and sending things out to people when I can. I've received a couple things and given out a lot of things as well and it makes me feel great about humanity

I used my last paycheck to cover the copays on my surgery today.  I am flat broke, my jaw chipped, shaved and reshaped.  The pain is intense.  The bleeding is non-stop.  The swelling is insane! I am miserable and I am here to ask for your help..please!!!!!




I am reaching out for help in getting things I can eat while I recover.  I'm only allowed liquids, certainly nothing that fits the bill of my needs.



Oral surgeon said to expect a long recovery process.  Quite possible nerve damage, he never lied let me tell you.  This pain is so intense, I've literally spent my entire day whimpering or crying.  I hurt so bad.  I'm so hungry but, can't eat right now...as mentioned, nothing suitable.



I've made an amazon wishlist with soups, gauze pads (to pop in my mouth to suck up the blood), some juice and I believe that's all.  I honestly can't remember...my brain is on overload.  It isn't a lot of stuff but, it would sure mean a whole hell of a lot if someone could help me out.



I will no doubt pay it forward or back if the helper chooses.  I just really need help right now.  Please?  I'm located in Ohio, really hard.  I need a little bit of relief.  I thank you for reading, considering and any help given to me.

My friend is a teacher and she had this random ""valentine's themed"" sign that she would use to teach the kids about the Holiday.  It was pretty funny looking and I noticed it in her car.  She asked me

I'm not big on hoarding and don't have a lover at the moment so

Then I got to thinking that maybe it WOULDN'T be such a good idea because:

a)  The owner of the car could be in a relationship that is NOT going well and this could cast an air of suspicion of cheating or weirdness on so many levels that my simple attempt at random kindness could actually result in some wackness.  No good.

b)  The owner of the car could literally drive themselves insane wondering WHO left that for them and/or

So

This was my very first planned act of kindness that is RANDOM and I guess it was pretty selfish when I think about it because I just didn't want this silly monkey to go in the trash.

I am a single dad with a 12 year old son who has had custody of him since he was 2. We are both on social security disability
With limited funds and no money to rent a U-Haul from MA to NH or the $500 security deposit for the apartment. I am afraid of becoming homeless for the first time in my life. I don’t want my son to think I am a failure. We have developed such a strong bond these past few years. The apartment is subsidized and is based on my income so I can afford it. It’s just getting moved in and Christmas that is killing me. If any of you could help out. I can’t even begin to thank you for your gratitude.

Hello /r/randomkindness. I'm not sure if this post belongs here or not

My daughter Sarah has been suffering from Crohn's Disease for ten years and it's not an overstatement, for 28 years now, and I've been through a lot, but nothing like her. Treatment after treatment fails for her after working only a short time, or worse, causes such a bad reaction that the medication itself actually has hospitalized her twice.

She has joint pain throughout her entire body after a bad reaction to Remicade a few years ago
Sarah's little sister, we thought she might be deaf. Now we're not sure what's wrong. She has a ""diagnosis"" of autism, but that was given to us by a speech pathologist who only saw her for 45 minutes. We think she might have suffered neurological damage from childhood jaundice but can't be sure. If there is damage, it's too ""mild"" to diagnose, so she gets ""autism"" instead. Izzy can barely speak and the words she does say are garbled and hard to understand. She has trouble with tasks like putting shoes on or taking them off, dressing, undressing, or at least attempt successfully around 50% of the time, affectionate, dance

I've posted on /r/assistance before, 25% of my take-home pay is going to Citibank so that we'll have a prayer of being debt free in around 4 years, providing there are no major problems between now and then. This is necessary because just the interest alone on this debt is leeching SO MUCH of our household income that it's literally destroying our family's well being. We can't take Sarah to clinical trials even if we got accepted to one because they're too far away and we can't afford plane tickets, hotels, or whatever, because of the $800-$1000 per month that I pay Citibank each month to keep ahead of the interest charges. Bankruptcy won't work for us. We'll be categorized Chapter 13 and then instead of our own aggressive repayment schedule, we'll have a court ordered
Like I said in the title, sick days, and snow days. When her joint pain became too severe for her to sit at her desk, she lay on the couch and wrote with pencil and paper.

Sarah wanted to sell her novel as an e-book to try to help our family out of this situation, wrote a foreword, and published the book to both Kindle and Nook.

You can read about the book here:

http://www.sarah-story.com/sarahs-writing/

You can read about Sarah's history

http://www.sarah-story.com

And the regularly updated blog is here:

http://www.sarah-story.com/news


Would any of you consider sharing the URL for the book (http://www.sarah-story.com/sarahs-writing/) through social media, classmates, whatever you feel might be appropriate, if you're so inclined? There is a link on that page to download the book for free in EPUB format for the curious, and a donate link for ""tips"" if you like it, so it's not even necessary to buy the book if you want to read it, and you can pay what you want, the book is $2.99.  (** UPDATE: non-US customers may have taxes or other fees added

Like I said

We're in Connecticut. I don't mean to be melodramatic, is going to come from. I'm already paying most of our bills two weeks late, and this week I had to take two days off unpaid to bring Izzy to a specialist consultation and a sedated outpatient diagnostic procedure. Things are getting bad. If we can generate interest in Sarah's book, it might bring some relief.

Thank you and kudos to you if you managed to read all of this. I'm not even sure where I'd begin on a TL;DR. Sorry if I've rambled.


** EDIT - Reddit, which will pay for 6-7 weeks worth of heating oil, which is good timing since it just started snowing outside last night. Thank you very, very much guys &amp; gals &amp; others. There are good people here. Sarah is extremely excited that people are reading her book. **

** EDIT 2 - We've lost our power, not a branch. We were able to use some of the donations to buy fuel for a generator we were loaned, but he generator blew when I hooked it up incorrectly due to bad advice. Still, redditors, without your donations we wouldn't have been able to go buy $100 worth of non-perishable food items at Walmart when we lost everything in our refrigerator. Thank you again.

TOILETRIES: - deodorant - body wash (old spice is really popular) - shampoo/conditioner - toothpaste - toothbrushes - baby wipes - mouthwash - suntan lotion - chapstick - tissue

GEAR: - SOCKS!!

We will accept any QUALITY pairs. - hand/foot warmers - gloves, sanitizer

FOOD/GOODS: - Tobacco: dip, whatever. - beef jerky - power bars, protein bars or energy bars - red bull - regular &amp; sugar free - candy (preferably not chocolate for obvious reasons), but licorice, hard candy, anything else is good - chips - easy mac, noodle bowls, hungry man, crystal light etc. - peanuts/sunflower seeds

COMFORT ITEMS: - books!! Great books, ANY would be fabulous - games: chess, checkers, cards, etc. - video games/dvds (NOTE: if sending these items, please mark them with a sharpie to note something for the troops, these are often stolen and sold back to soldiers and marking them helps to prevent them from re-selling these items) - riddle books (please no Sudoku or crossword puzzles) - music - pens/notebooks/envelopes - magazines - posters (NOTE: we cannot accept ANY posters with inappropriate content - nudity, political or religious statements)

Other items you can send us: - Letters or thank you cards to include with our packages, MUST BE SEALED) - international phone cards!  These guys can only call home so often, and a lot of the time they are asked to pay for their calls, these help immensely.  - postage!!  Each box costs us $11-13 to send out, so any stamps or postage help is accepted as well - reddit paraphernalia!! Since this group is through reddit, I plan on putting some type of reddit sticker or symbol the boxes. Maybe we'll even see some pop up on their humvees and other places.

Please don't send us: - alcohol - pornography - weapons - ANY pork products, obviously) - hate mail, come on guys.

Many of these are restricted or banned

I'm a Visual Communication (Graphic Design) Major, when I'll lose my two wonderful on-campus jobs and have to fight tooth and nail for a new opportunity elsewhere.


Here are [two resumes](http://i.imgur.com/Fh0Of.jpg) I recently touched up, they're also difficult to read on purpose. 


I am a manager (I hire people) where I work and I see a lot of awful resumes come through, graduating soon/recently, and worried about their future employment/careers.


How I envision this process:

• Send me your current resume (all the language you want)
• Clarify the type of employment you're looking for
• Although I am not officially an 'expert', etc. This will require a bit of communication.


I'm aware it's kind of a strange proposition to hand over all your personal information to me via the internet, like you would a random HR manager (that likely doesn't even know what Reddit is), to keep it to myself.

1320957857.0,m7udd,[RK Suggestion] Dealing with hostile comments &amp; potential scammers,ransim,34,5,41,"There has been a rash of comments recently on posts by users that are hostile

Likewise we have people who feel that some people are requesting/asking for items to often or are lying about their situation to engender sympathy.

RandomKindness is not about helping the needy

That said, please always remember to be kind.

** **

**Few tips for dealing with hostile comments:**

* **Use the report function -** At the bottom of every comment and post is a report link. This will send a message to the moderators so they know to check the comment. 

* **Don't feed the troll -** Trolls live to get a rise out of you

* **Don't drop to their level -** Don't sling insults back at them

**Protecting yourself from scammers:**

* **Ask for verification -** Scammers are unfortunately a reality

* **Check their comment history -** Has this person been a redditor for awhile? Do they have a good comment history? Keep in mind no history does not mean someone is a scammer

* ** Check the [reddit givers list](http://www.sdorm.org/redditgivers/)
** - Reddit givers provides a list where givers can report items they give to others and those who receive can self report items they receive. 

**What to do when you've identified a potential scammer:**

* **Do not post a comment calling that user out -** These sort of posts only create drama and flame wars that only further muddle the situation for moderators attempting to figure out whats going on.

* **[Send a message to the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23RandomKindness) -** Send us a message

**TL;DR -** Be kind,,False,self,t5_2szh3,True,,True

I'll let Reddit upvotes along with maybe some flips of a quarter help me decide who gets it.  After that I'll PM the lucky winner for a mailing address.

My semi-arbitrary decision will be made ~~Friday~~ Wednesday morning some time after my first coffee of the day.

There is one rule however

EDIT: I just realized that I'm going to have way too difficult a time deciding a winner from among all you maple-deprived folks...  Therefore I will be shutting this offer down Wednesday morning

Okay, did some Loonie tossing and here's the verdict.
Mamayoda is the winner partially because of need (although I do realize that everyone needs maple syrup) , coin toss, random luck, etc. So she gets the maple sugary care package. (PM ME YOUR MAILING COORDINATES)
________________________________________
The 12 semi-random runners up who will each receive a smaller (125ml) tin of syrup as well as some soft maple sugar candies) are:

BrerBunny - because of musicality

Ludidify - because of being the furthest person away

DonaldJDarko - because I loved that movie

Sortika - because of having maple-needy mother

Alfet - as long as you promise not to go to war with Canada's UK cousins over the Falklands/Malvinas again

Utasora - because of yet another case of maple withdrawal

Sword_of_Morning - because of rotten brat &amp; Texas

jldiaz910 - because it's never over until the fat lady sings

AsIfYouCared - for invoking the Maple Gods

Andaroodle - because he will need something to keep him sane while living in that bomb shelter (note: if you think Y2K was bad

dbcooper2012 - to help you suck up to your room-mates

ImperialMinion - because of yet more maple syrup withdrawal

________________________________________
PM ME YOUR MAILING COORDINATES AND I WILL GET THE PACKAGES SENT OUT TO YOU ASAP.
________________________________________

But those of you who are not among the ""Chosen ones"" need not despair. Pyrexic from Montreal has offered to join forces with me to help fill this DESPARATE need for maple sugar products.

In fact I encourage any of the Canadian (or New England) Redditors out there to feel free to join in and send Maple sugary goodness to the people I didn't get to. I also encourage people to post the user names of the folks you do get to so that we can tell who is still in a state of need/despair/whatever.

http://i.imgur.com/KG0vn.jpg

Its made with a wool yarn

**Yarn:** http://www.lionbrand.com/yarns/we-thick.htm

**How this will work:**

I've chosen random numbers from ***1-100*** and will give the scarves to the people who guess the number. Please also post with your guess a color. I won't promise you'll get the exact color you want (depends on what the store has)

It'll take me a bit of time to make each one as I won't start them till winners are chosen and I hit the store to buy the yarn.

**Edit:** Wow lots of replies! No one has managed to guess a number yet. Everyone gets one guess per day. I'll let this go until Friday at the latest and if no one guesses it I'll just randomly from the replies. ^_^

**Edit 2:** So far one correct guess

**Edit 3:** Bought the yarn for the first lucky random soul. I figure since it was a fairly popular color request I'll post a picture of the yarn. http://i.imgur.com/SV3qm.jpg You also get a random cat in the picture

**Edit 4:** No one has managed to guess correctly yet

**First scarf progress:** http://i.imgur.com/U5FBs.jpg (this is actually from earlier yesterday its about twice this length already.

I'm a semiprofessional jewelry artist and compulsive creator.  Right now, but don't have any money to spend on frivolous things?  Know somebody that could use a fun little surprise?  Look no further!  I can also answer questions about making things, if you've got those!  I know where to buy the best (or most cost-effective) supplies, what metals are best to use where, and the best way to take a picture of a piece of jewelry with a dinky point and shoot.  

I should probably do a little lurking around to figure out the best way to run this thing, and if there is something that I have screwed up with this first post, let me know so that I can attempt to fix it!

   *  ~~**Tampons/Pads.** I use Always Overnight Pads. They're in a purple package. The only things that I don't bleed through. I use Playtex Gentle Glide tampons in the super size for the same reason.~~ **The lovely people at /r/MLPLounge have gifted me all I need in this category.**
   
 * **Underwear.** This isn't as important as the top two but it would be nice. I wear a large.

If anyone needs any details about anything please PM me and I'll definitely tell you whatever you want to know.

* **CONGRATULATIONS** everyone

* **Goodbye [Kate](http://www.reddit.com/user/katiekatums)**
A sad news to start with. When I started this journey I was not sure it will be a success. At the start I forced one of my friend Kate from another sub-reddit to start being a mod here. I am glad she gave all she could in this limited time. Now that things are getting busy in other sub-reddit she wants to step down from RK. I am sure you all will join me in thanking her for her support so far.

* **NEW MOD(s)** This means that we now should probably hire a couple of mods.

  **In words of [ransim](http://www.reddit.com/user/ransim):** We need someone who seems to handle things in a levelheaded and kind manner. Even when calling something out for being suspicious I think we mods need to lead as an example. There is always a polite way to handle issues. Someone eager to help but also understands what this subreddit is about. Its about random acts of kindness not necessarily helping out the needy. Someone who has been involved with the subreddit

 **In summary** 

 You should believe what this community stands for and be active. 
 
 You should have some community management experience. 

 You should be able to manage things in a kind way.

 You should also state what times you are likely to be available (in GMT please)
 
 You should make your case of modship right here in comments and we will let the community decide

* **Text only posts** I guess we should have taken this decision a long time ago

* **GET THE FLAIR!** I would like to remind everyone that **REQUESTED &amp; RECEIVED flairs are mandatory**. This shows the community if somebody is constantly being ignored or if somebody is already enjoyed a bit of random kindness. Getting OFFERED &amp; SENT is optional as we would not want to force you to show-off if you do not want to. If you see a requester with no flair please remind them politely in comments to get the flair. Same goes with receivers. Flair should can be requested on [flair.randomkindness.org.uk](http://flair.randomkindness.org.uk) however if there is any issue

* **UPVOTE ALL GOOD THINGS** Remember that our random acts of kindness are only visible to world when these are upvoted more. It makes me sad when I see an offer with 120 comments and just 20 upvotes. Be randomly kind

It's getting closer and closer to the holidays

Back when I was in fifth grade, but I believe the original pricepoint on the basic model was $69-99. That was a LOT. I didn't get that scooter that year, and being a child, without the specific developmental skills to fathom problems outside of my own, I was upset. The next Christmas, I got one. However, I was in 6th grade, then just put it away and never used it again. As I grew up, just a little later when they could properly afford it

So, that's good, too. Please tell me your story, and through upvotes and how much my personal heartstrings get tugged, I will make my decision. I will also ship it promptly, so that it can be there on that special morning.

I will ship it anywhere in the US. This was given out of selfless sacrifice and it deserves to be loved

The last couple months have been very rough on my husband and I. Right before I went down south for a week to visit my grandparents, his health insurance has been badgering us and either refusing to cover stuff that they have to, or giving us total and complete hell with the run around that they've given us.

To make matters worse, so they have me go through a pelvic CT scan, even though I'm cringing when the bill for it will come along.

Found our yesterday that they found inflammation and fatty deposits around my colon/large intestine (the fatty deposits mean that there's been past inflammation). This is a bad sign that I'm developing Crohn's Disease

So on my birthday on the 25th, and they're vague at most if any of this will be covered. Even if we can pay down the debts slowly, it's been a terrible depression on me, since we had only just finally gotten past bills and debts taken care of. 

Past birthdays have sucked

I'm honestly not sure what I'm requesting other then some well wishing and knowing that someone out there cares. These problems have been weighing so heavily on my mind

I did make an amazon wishlist for my birthday because a friend was thinking of getting me something and then bowed out from doing so, if I won't already for the post alone). I'll just put it here in case anyone feels nice enough to have a look and get me something, though I don't expect it. I know how financial hard times are. Most of it's just small geeky things I wouldn't mind (I'm a total nerd): http://amzn.com/w/32JOAMIP3OC9O

Thanks to anyone who read through all of this. This subreddit has been nice to visit to see so many people made happy here. I just hope I can get through all of this with my sanity in tact.

At the place in Tennessee, pets were not allowed and I trusted my old roommate in New Orleans, a friend of 9 years, to watch her until I could go get her. He decided he could no longer watch her for me and gave me two days notice before he was going to abandon her. It was through this misfortune that she wound up boarding at a different veterinary facility, until transportation could be found for her. There we found out that my,” had actually been severely neglecting her and she now also had bladder stones. After having a new veterinarian look over her records and treat her

This is where I need help. I can't afford the surgery that she needs. I've already paid around $3, pressing matter, that needs to be resolved as soon as possible. Within a day or two, scans of some of the important, original paperwork from her vet records as well as paperwork I'll be getting from a consult about her surgery I have set up Thursday morning will be uploaded to the website to help support the legitimacy of the claims I have made here and in her [story](http://savederpy.blogspot.com/).

Any way that anyone can help me out would be very greatly appreciated. Maybe you own a business in the Asheville, but would love to be pointed in the direction of any additional resources, especially any that wouldn't have a long wait/application processing period--want to get this done as soon as possible before she starts feeling pain from the bladder stones. I've never been in an emergency situation like this and could use any sort of support and guidance I could get. Maybe you've been in a similar situation and have a success story you could share with me that could help give me more direction and some hope. I feel like I'm doing everything I can and at the same time I feel as though I am doing nowhere near enough. I could really even just use someone older and more experienced with life to be able to talk to for advice and encouragement. (I'm 24, have no immediate family, and only a few close friends around my age to talk to, most of which live halfway across the country and have been too busy with their own problems to talk to me lately.)

Thank you so much for your time and consideration. Please help in any way to prevent me from having to give my dog away after all I have already done and gone through for her—if I'd even be able to find someone to take her and pay for all of her treatment. Her life before we got her was a very sad one, healthy life. Despite everything she has been through, she is still the sweetest dog that wants nothing but to be good and loving. My relationship with her is incredibly important to both of us and I have learned so much about love and life through my experiences with my Derpy. I consider myself to be incredibly lucky that Derpy is the dog I wound up getting out of many different choices of dogs, despite her medical issues, because she is the most amazing dog I have ever met and she has made a serious impact in my life and the lives of others around her.

tl;dr I have a sick dog that needs help getting a life-saving surgery. For a more detailed story on Derpy

""I was the pleasantly surprised victim of a random act of kindness tonight...I took the kids out to eat to the Cracker Barrel on 53 in Braselton. After we finished eating, ""Would your girls like a bear?"" I wondered for a minute if it was some charity fundraiser or breast cancer awareness type thing. As I went to answer her, an elderly man, at least in his 80's-90's approached us. ""Would your girls like a bear?"" I said ""Well, sure, what's it for?"" The employee at Cracker Barrel smiled, she knew. Another Cracker Barrel employee walked up to me as they were handing Cali and Zoe the bears and told me that last year his wife passed away, he also notices Zoe playing with a doll that she just won't let go. He in turn returns to the cash register to purchase her the doll as well. It was such a sincere act of kindness. I plan to randomly return the favor and pass it on

Regarding web design/development: I will teach you even if you have no prior experience at all in web design/development

Regarding programming: I have worked with quite a few programming languages, C# and (for web) PHP/Javascript. If you're a beginner or have never programmed before, I can help you with all of these. Even if you're working with another language and are struggling on some basic concepts, chances are I can help you.

* You need to have Skype (it's a free download and free account creation), but I frequently chat with friends in the US, and getting up a little early or staying up a little late isn't a problem for me. I'm sure we can work something out.

* You need to speak decent English. I'm not asking for a BA in English Literature, will be much easier if we can understand each other easily.

* You need to be motivated enough to practice a little on your own. The learning process will go a lot better if, just messing around with stuff. Honestly, the vast majority of *good* IT professionals got their start by fiddling around with their computer despite not knowing what might happen.

* You have to WANT to LEARN: I have 32 ""students"" on my contact list, and that's fine, but others simply never come online. I would think they didn't like my teaching, except I haven't even *taught them yet*. Please make sure you really want to learn and stay the course. :)

**If you're interested

Please don't ask me if I have room for more! Just post here and send me a PM with your Skype name. I will do my best to find time for you! I have people spread across a bunch of different time zones, you're sure to get a slot.

1375134580.0,1jb0f0,[RK] The results of our RandomKindness video game post survey,Avien,24,3,6,"Over the year we've had a vocal few express some contempt for video game related requests and offers. 

We the Moderators have generally allowed such posts but have left it up to the community to vote

Some video game offers and requests are accepted and therefore encourage more requests and more offers

I tried some months back to create a poll that would gauge how the community felt about video games. Unfortunately there was very little response

Last week I received a couple more messages that were complaining of a recent influx in the number of video game requests. So yet again I decided to try to poll the community and see what you guys and gals think.

---
**The Results:**

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1aIl_ogODj5WYa4smmzQ6ZFrF1vCn7P4UfXPZDZD_ODQ/viewanalytics

---
**Analysis:**

**Question 1:** Should we allow video game Requests on RandomKindness?

**Answer:** Divided. Yet again the community is unable to come to a overwhelming consensus about video game requests. 70 people think they shouldn't be allowed and 67 people think they should. A three person difference is not statistically sound enough to make a rule that video game requests can't be allowed on RK.

**Question 2:** Should RK allow video game related OFFERS on RandomKindness?

**Answer:** A resounding 'yes'! 72% of the community believes we should allow video game offers.

**Question 3:** Do you think Steam offers/requests are negatively affecting the subreddit?

**Answer:** Apparently not. I asked this question because I wanted to see if the community had an issue with video games or just the Steam game platform since most game requests/offers on RK tend to be Steam related. 

**Question 4:** Do you think all video game offers &amp; requests are negatively affecting the subreddit

**Answer:** Definitely not.

**Question 5:** Why do think video game requests are hurting this subreddit?

**Answer:** I'm not very happy with this question. It was a pointed question and I don't think the 'check all that apply' option was the best way of answering it

Those that do feel like video games adversely effect this subreddit have a variety of opinions:

* Video game posts create clutter or spam the subreddit
* They're so common that the giving of a game doesn't seem like a 'kind act' anymore
* Many scammers like to request Steam games and RK is not adapt at preventing this
* /r/playitforward 
* Physical copies of games should be allowed while digital copies should not
* Video game requests sound immature

**Question 6:** Should RK allow requests &amp; offers for video game related peripherals?

**Answer:** Definitely yes.

**Question 7:** Did this survey do a good job at representing how you feel about video game posts on RandomKindness?

**Answer:** Yes it did. I was hoping that if I was to make a Mod judgement based on the opinions of the community

---

**Conclusions:**

I don't think anything should change

Many members feel that these requests are bogging down the subreddit and I don't think they're wrong. 

The point that was brought up about RK being unable to handle video game scammers is completely valid. That is why the other subreddits mentioned above are much better for these sort of requests

I think that for time being, and /r/RandomActsOfGaming 

Those who want to offer games on RK should continue to do so.

* We'd like to interview a couple of entrepreneurs in each country, for which we're trying to find a sponsor, perhaps a Business School for example.   These days we hear a lot about the financial crisis, but not often enough do we hear about those who are trying to turn their ideas into reality despite of it.   

* We could do a recipe from each location

* We really want to create a video like [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kdcbaiv2y4) Help us choose a song!

* We're going to do a drawing contest with all the children we meet through local charities

* Let me take pictures of your wedding!
* Let us crash on your couch!
* Buy us a drink! Invite us to a party!
* Help us find some sponsors.
* Help us find a car

1323099842.0,n16kh,[request] (UK) Birthday/Christmas cards for my husband. ,decline_,22,1,13,"Hello lovely people of Random Kindness

My husband and I have have a hard few months: I had to leave my job, but we haven't had anything nice in quite a while. I don't mean nice like cakes or trips to the cinema, but things like socialisation and general interaction with people outside of work and immediate family, so morale is quite low at the moment. 

My husband has also been a star and is working as much overtime as his company can give him to try and dig us back out of this hole. While things are looking slightly better for us now

My husband's birthday is on the 21st of December, obviously; make him a little card, perhaps make him breakfast in bed, but I *really* want him to know how much I appreciate all of his hard work. This is where you come in!

Do you think you could send him a birthday card with happy wishes or a cheerful message? It would make an otherwise dreary

If you can send him a card

*He's pretty much your average codemonkey type geek. He works as a software engineer for a web design company and spends what seems like most of his time in front of a computer. He loves to game and set up a minecraft server for our friends and colleagues and he plays unreal tournament at lunchtime with his colleagues. He's a keen sci-fi fan, Firefly) as well as loving comedy like The IT Crowd and The Mighty Boosh. He's also a keen traceur and spends a frightening amount of time jumping from one high place to another and shinning up the sides of walls and buildings. Also: we have 3 cats and although he won't admit it in public, he loves them more than I imagine he'd love his (imaginary!) firstborn. In fact, right now he's balancing a laptop and a cat on his knee simultaneously.*

Ohh! And his twitter is @altreus. Warning! Contains an ungodly amount of puns.

1373843234.0,1iawre,[Request] [US] I recently rescued a abandoned kitty here in AZ. And I'd really love a Cat Tree for his little rambunctious self to climb on (rather than my counters) -pictures/story included-,Flesh_Odium,32,15,19,"**TLDR version before I get into the loooong story:**
Rescued a little black cat (now named Calcifer) who had been abandoned in Arizona. After jumping some hoops with a few animal shelters he's now happily living with me and my other cat. I'd really love to get a cat tree for him to sort of redirect his tendency to jump on counters. It doesn't have to be fancy and I'm fine with hand me downs

Edit : 
Guess it helps to include my amazon list. http://amzn.com/w/2W6JG1LECU2DS

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Now onto the story:

During a walk about a month or so ago I find this cute little cat wandering around, so I'm always wary seeing cats outdoors) well he instantly started meowing loudly back at me and didn't run. I went over to pet him to find he was extremely skinny and clearly skittish, however not of me but the world around him. I decided to go back home to grab some of my own cat's food and bring it to him and see how he reacts. When I returned to where I had left him, he was nowhere to be found. I was worried he'd left, so I called him for a few minutes and low and behold he came running from the direction of my house (he literally followed me home) so I placed down his dish and let him scarf down his food, he spent a good 15 minutes alternating from scarfing to walking back to me to purr and rub himself against me frantically. Sort of like some odd animal version of thank you. I felt far too worried about his state to leave him and decided I would take him in and see if anyone in the area was missing a cat. After some questions it turned out, no, and in fact this cat was seen around the area a lot. So I started my almost week long search for a no kill shelter for the guy as I couldn't let such a sweet cat risk being put down, every cat shelter was full. I was starting to loose hope. I had him quarantined in my bathroom this whole time due to not being sure if he was healthy enough to be near my cat. I had to find figure out something fast. But by some stroke of luck and kindness a woman who owns Arizona Cactus Cats offered to essentially adopt him to us. Meaning I pay her a low fee that takes care of all the cat vet bills in their name as they have discounts from being an adoption center. I jumped on this opportunity and a few days later after a vet visit and a few papers signed he was mine officially.

 Calcifer is making a good transition into domestic home life, but I believe he must of been a house cat at one point and was simply abandoned as he quickly got into the swing of getting out of the cupboard and sleeping on chairs and playing with my female and the toys I have gotten him.

Now for the reason I'm here. Calcifer is apparently a tree dweller and likes to jump up onto tall things (aka: my counters &gt;.&lt;) and I'd really love to get a cat tree for him to sort of redirect this tendency. It doesn't have to be fancy and I'm fine with hand me downs

Here are a few pictures of him for the curious.

This is one of his first days out of the cupboard (into the sink above it - . - ) he's still dirty as I hadn't worked up the nerve to try bathing him - http://i.imgur.com/AMTYP6D.jpg

Here's him on one of his first days out of the bathroom quarantine

Here he is demonstrating his intense need to be high up. I was folding clothes and putting them away when I returned to this. He was immediately removed and discouraged from attempting that again. But it was cute in the moment. -http://i.imgur.com/SGbQ7ze.jpg

The guy I was KINDA talking to again (we were engaged at one time) and I are no longer speaking. He started seeing someone else, and we had made pretty solid plans for a visit in November. He asked me to come visit. And then this. It was just a low blow, you know? 

A couple months prior to that, but I miss having my own. I had JUST bought it, too. 

And finally, the past week has been brutal. For instance, I waited on a table of highschool boys who not only stiffed me, made fun of me (for I'm assuming my weight), and then one tried to run out on a 3 dollar ticket. *3 dollars*. I mean yes...it's a tiny amount. But I would have had to pay that. And then when I went outside to write down the kids license plate number, he straight up said he was going to ""slap me in the face for being such a cunt"". Who does that? Over three dollars. 

Anyway, and that's what I'm doing. So hi! I appreciate all of you listening to my drivel, actually. It feels kinda good to get that off my chest.

It affects everything. I go into and out of depression from shit in my life and when I come out, then start yelling at each other nearly every Saturday night that I don't spend with them. Sometimes I waste a Saturday night being with them and watching a movie I had already seen or not interested by to make sure they don't fight. When they do, I can hear it from anywhere in the house and through my music playing through my head phones. My mom always ends up crying and sleeping in the guest bedroom while my dad usually goes to their room and goes to bed or goes and plays BF games on the computer for a while. I don't know what the problem is and that is what frustrates me. Its not the influence of alcohol because I can always hear them say something about the other when the other isn't around like ""You're being like your dad"" or ""Stop bitching and just do it"". My dad said the second one earlier today when she left the car to grab a table while we parked at a restaurant. Sometimes now I dread my dad coming home from work because he could piss my mom off somehow in one way or the other. The only thing that I know makes each other fight is when my dad plays games on the computer rather than hanging out with her and my sister. I feel like I am to blame for that because I got him into playing computer games. I can't stand it when they fight and it tears me into pieces. I get a lump in my throat, feel guilt for some reason, and feel like hope is gone. It makes me just want to stop what I do and sleep until I forget about it for a while. It always comes back to haunt me though later and distracts me especially at school. I just need some words from other people who are and have been through this to give me some help or tips for what to do.

I go to school from 8 am - 3:00 on Monday and Wednesday with no breaks between classes so there is no way for me to grab anything from the cafeteria or even use the microwave. I am usually starving by the time I get out of class and get home. 

I also start to feel weak by lunch time some days so I thought I would start taking lunch to school. We are permitted to eat during class. I figured since its turning off cold outside soups would be a perfect option for lunch so I set out to find a thermos. 

I checked the thrift stores and the dollar tree and no luck. I checked out the prices at Walmart and about had a heart attack it is just 15 - 20 bucks just for a thermos. They did not even have a lunch box/thermos combo other than those for children. Even the kids thermos (just the thermos) was 12.88. 

I am not asking anyone to go out and purchase anything. I just wanted to see if

He followed me alongside of old buildings to the parking lot where my car was and sparked a usual ""street-beggar/under-the-bridge-junkie"" conversation.

As he was telling me how he failed in trying to save his drowning wife and son during the hurricane Katrina floods - that story got deeper and sadder. By then we already made it to my car - I shared good smoke with the man

Next couple of days I'll gather up few things like clothes, addictions, abuse, mental health issues or just plain ""dealing with sad people"" - takes us out of the comfort zone, it's understandable.

1353340588.0,13gd7a,"[Request][US,AL] Friend in a tight spot. I don't want her to have to drop out of college.",QuixoticChemist,28,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/13gd7a/requestusal_friend_in_a_tight_spot_i_dont_want/, she has not received one penny of assistance for college. Due to working full time and going to school full time

She owes the university $1000 by November 26th. If she does not pay this, she may qualify for scholarship again next semester! If she can get past this hump, things will get a little easier financially.

This girl deserves help more than anyone I know. She has always selflessly been there for every friend she has. She has ended up with the short end of the stick so many times in her life that I am surprised it has taken her this long to feel defeated. She works her tail off everyday to be a good student, but I really can only spare a little. I am definitely giving her that little. 

Do you have any idea on how to collect $1000 in a week? I would appreciate ideas or any contributions I could find. I have never asked for money before in my life

TL;DR The best person I know is $1000 short on a college payment. Ideas or contributions would be a magical blessing. I do not know another place to turn. 

Edit: We are considering a small personal loan. I am not asking for any one person to donate $1000 as that is a huge amount of money,,False,self,t5_2szh3,1353364775.0,,True

1347384534.0,zput3,[RK] Regarding Monetary Requests and Fundraisers,annelysa,21,3,7,"Hello all

It has come to our attention our rule regarding monetary requests has been a little confusing. For a while we thought that it was nice to see the subreddit come together as a whole to help someone out for a good cause or fundraiser

It seems that for both our members, all fundraising requests have gone largely ignored, at least from our standpoint. Therefore, we feel it is in the best interest of the subreddit to amend the rule to state that: **No monetary requests will be allowed, regardless of intent.**

While this includes fundraisers and flat out requests for money, however, request that any persons looking to request money please visit /r/Assistance or /r/Loans. 

**From this point forward

Please post your questions,False,self,t5_2szh3,False,,10Kmod,t3_zput3
