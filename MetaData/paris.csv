**Clarification:** I didn't mean to make it sound like I was expecting Dali moustaches and berets on everyone. I make it a habit to find out for myself instead of believing the stereotypes that were handed down by media and word of mouth.
 
Rude Parisians: Nope. Busy/not able to assist a hapless tourist - sure. Now show me a major city ANYWHERE that doesn't have that. 99% were willing to make an effort. (I was seriously internet enabled so I had an advantage to the point I was able to help a guy from Belgium navigate the metro so...)

Smell/Dirty: Not from what I saw. Street cleaners were a regular fixture in the 10th district and were very visible in other areas as well. Maybe it gets more fragrant in summer but I challenge any big city to do better.

Don't speak perfect French - you're boned: The closest I got to this was when someone asked me for directions and I had to let them know that I didn't speak enough of the language to help them and that got me a bit of a ""fuck you"" shrug. After that it turned into almost a playful game with a few waiters of I'm not speaking English

After two weeks I've learned to ""pardon"" my way on and off the Metro like a Parisian and I'm 24h back home and already missing your fair city. Make a minor effort to use the language and most people will meet you halfway.

As an American, you must keep your dog on a leash. It's not really a matter of ""just in case your dog takes off"" it's more a matter of ""BECAUSE your dog will take off"". Most dogs in public will get excited when a stranger pays any attention to them, licking, panting, sometimes jumping up and down if it isn't trained (or, on the contrary, they will bark).  It's as if American dogs are just highly emotional creatures.  

But here in Paris, they're just beyond jaded.  They'll even wait at the front of a store without a leash while their owner shops.  IT BLOWS MY MIND.

So what is with this?  Are city pet owners required to take their dogs to training school?  What is it that Parisians are doing differently with their dogs that make them so... subservient?

* I've found the Metro to be better than the tube (london) and subway (new york) in terms of frequency and reliabilty during operating hours. Although has lots of stairs.

* Fare evasion is a national past time. Parisians will go out of their way to help fellow parsians get through the turnstiles without a ticket. Station staff turn a blind eye.

* Parisians like smoking

* There are no convenience stores like 7/11 anywhere.

* A lot of streets are named after famous people and events. Leclerc, de gaulle (you get the picture).

* Not many people i've encountered speak english well even in the touristy areas.

* I feel sorry for the parisian women who wear high heel shoes day in day out. But everyone's dress sense is incredible. You can easily spot the tourist in paris unlike in lots of other cities I've visited.

* I don't know how parisians negotiate the champs elysee roundabout. (12 streets merging). Watching it looked like organized chaos.

* Cyclists own the city an are respected. They even have their own miniature traffic lights.

* The bouncers in paris are douchebags just like any other city.

* I've found most parisians to be nice. Saying thank you and goodbye to shop owners is a must. Speaking in broken french is better that asking ""parlez vous anglais"". They respect that you are making an effort.

* Never pay more than 1 euro for the bottled water they sell on the street. I once asked how much it was and the guy said 2 euros. I walked away because I only had 1 euro on me and he stopped me and said I could have it for 1.

* Keep to the right on all escalators if you don't want to be poleaxed

If you like art, I've heard musee D'Orsay across the river is actually better.

Don't go up the Eiffel Tower. It's honestly not worth it. You'll wait like 6 hours. If you pick a weekday

Some people say that's because it's the only place in Paris where you can't see the Montparnasse Tower..

Versailles is worth a whole day. The gardens are massive and you can even row in the lake. Make sure you get on the RER early enough. I'd also check out the sacre cœur.

People love the catacombs, you'll be in line a long while. If you can get there on time it's worth it for sure.

If you like military museums

One of the best things to do in Paris is picnic and lounge in public. Parisians do this in every park, games and more. Join them. (My favorite was along the Champ des Mars under the Eiffel Tower)

Great clubs are Batofar

Girls usually like the champs élysées for shopping

All donezos. Enjoy Paris!

I felt alone; the few friends that I do have in Paris were unavailable, and when I had my face spat into, I was suddenly aware of how a vicious stereotype could have been started.  But we all know that ass holes are found anywhere in this world, and I could easily have been in another city such as New York, Chicago, Berlin, Amsterdam, Beijing

I received a lot of messages from insulted French people (as well as people of other nationalities) and I saw a lot of posts from people around the world, there are some rude people.  Same as New York.  It's a big-city mentality and it plagues big cities all over the world.  Even Parisians complain about the attitudes of other Parisians, and once you leave the limits of Paris, the kindness and hospitality can be overwhelming.  I personally live and work with a French-German family, and they are some of the most kind, hospitable and open-minded people I have ever had the pleasure to meet. 

So here's what I'm doing today:  I'm passing this sunny day in the kitchen, but I can bake a mean muffin.


**EDIT:  Thursday night's muffin extravaganza was swell.  I had a lovely time and I'd like to thank all the super duper folks who stopped by to gobble up the baked goods.  I will update everyone on the Friday evening situation, and This-is-relevant, unless those are the user names of people who changed their minds and decided to stop by tonight instead.**

Hi ! 

Just to let you know that I'm a new moderator of r/Paris. 

There was a [problem with the spam filter](http://www.reddit.com/r/paris/comments/fuiz8/why_do_all_my_posts_disappear_off_of_this/) and the previous mod was gone since 2 years

How do you want this subreddit to be modded ?

Most of the post here are in English

I don't think there's a need for strict guidelines

Do you want to do anything particular with this subreddit ?

Can someone make us a little **logo** ?

Does somebody else want to be mod ?

Voilà ! 

Merci !

1374878958.0,1j4m0n,Writer working on story in Paris. Need help!,HemingNoWay,21,5,13,"TL;DR:  I'm doing a crazy road trip from Paris to Marseille

Hey R/Paris! 

A few months ago my life changed drastically. My fiancee had a nervous breakdown and left me to return to Argentina. I lost my job. I felt incredibly depressed. And

Then, I came across an idea for a story –– a story that has given me a whole new purpose and some hope for the future. But, I'm writing to you guys because I might need the help of the good people in Paris to make it happen. (I'm Canadian! I basically speak French. We cool right?)

As a quick summary of the story (more info below): I'm recreating a road trip that happened 30 years ago between Julio Cortazar

But they were writing a book and they had made up some rules... this would be no ordinary road trip! They would stop at every rest stop along the way, heart broken, never wrote again and died about a year later.

Well... My fiancee and I had a huge connection to Cortazar

But... I am very short on cash (hint: no job). And there are a few HUGE obstaclesa

1. A Car: I don't really want to rent a car since it will thousands of bucks for something decent. I'd love to pay someone in Paris $400-$500 for lending me their car? Sounds sketchy, we can meet in person, sign a contract, what ever you want! (even if you knew any cheap cars for sale, etc)

2. Spread the word! Since I'm a freelancer, your Facebooks, and Instagrams, or what have you. Below are the links!

3. Buddies! I would love to meet up with people either in Paris or along the way

4. Cell phone plan: whats a good one that I can use for data with iPhone 4 and only temporary. Have no idea.

See you guys on the road!

I'm here because I'd love to know from any non-Europeans what that process is like. I know that the government isn't exactly dying to give out CDIs to Americans (or anyone non-European) so:

1. are there any tricks? 
2. How long does the process typically take to go from foreign student --&gt; CDI worker?
3. Have any of you done this successfully? 

Finally

Man

*The plan:*

Starting out for some drinks in a bar. After that hit a music [festival](http://www.fnac.com/guides/musique/indetendances/default.asp?NID=-2) nearby (thanks baptistemarchand).

* The date: Friday 13th of August
* The time: Around 19 o'clock
* Where: The Pure Malt at 4 Rue Caron in the 4th (little scottisch bar
* How do I get there? Metro stop Saint Paul

*Stuff for discussion*: I'll contact Shepp66 to see if he's really up for his pub being invaded by Redditors. Then could somebody figure out how late the music festival starts and when it ends? (I'm Dutch and my French sucks) Depending on that the time might change a bit

Let's have an awesome night!

I think the easiest way to do this is to list what I have that I am willing to give up, then we will need to meet in person :)


What I have:


**SEEDS:**

* Lolla Rossa Lettuce

* Batavian ""Blond du Paris"" Lettuce

* Chicoree Scarole Lettuce

* Reine de Mai Lettuce

* 'Le Généreux' Cucumber

* Tiny Tim Tomatoes

* Cayenne Peppers

* Sweet Snap Peas


*All of these seeds are suitable for container gardening/urban balcony gardening if situated right. You can train cucumbers to grow in a bush shape if they are given something similar to a tomato cage


**SEEDLINGS:**

* Hass Avocado (1) - Very healthy taproot


* Meyer Lemon (2) - Super healthy and happy plants. Both are about 2"" tall and have a sturdy pair of first leaves


*Both the Avocado and Meyer Lemon trees make excellent apartment plants as long as they are potted properly and have plenty of sunlight. They can also both be pruned into ""bonsai"" type trees so they will be much shorter and more round as opposed to tall. They are from organic/fairtrade fruits so will bear fruit if you are patient enough! They are very beautiful plants in the meantime. I can send pictures of either.*


I am interested in anything that is suitable for a container garden. I am particularly looking in the following, because you never know!


* Succulent snips or seeds of any kind aside from Aloe varieties
* Lithop seeds
* Echinacea seeds (any variety/Colour)
* Any edibles - seed or very young plants suitable for containers (particularly sweet peppers, olive, coffee, vanilla bean, lime, kale, strawberries... let me know what you have!)
* Variety of flower good for attracting bees


I realize that a few of the plants I'm looking for aren't suitable for our zone (8), use growlights indoors, etc. 


Sorry that was kinda long-winded


Have a great weekend!

1) Is there anyone willing to try and make one or two restaurant reservations for me??? I've done a bunch of research on this subreddit and had friends recommend places and I'm worried if I don't make reservations, I'm shooting for Le Petite Pontoise... 

~~2) Can I buy BBQ sauce

~~3) Cheap pay-as-you-go sim card recommendations for GSM phones?~~

4) Good/Any place to watch EPL? NFL? Bowl games?

5) Favorite place to buy wine/cheese?

**Edit: Now with more questions!**

6) Weather will be cold and rainy

7) What are the boldest/spiciest french wines? Burgundy? 

8) Good pizza place in Paris? I come from NYC so I prefer big and cheesy...

9) Any pro tips on names of pastries we should try? 

10) Will a lot of cafes have mulled wine or is that something street vendors do?

I've accumulated 3 questions recently to ask you guys. 

1. Is the tap water in Paris safe to drink? Both in terms of sanitation and mineral content. I've noticed a lot of people buying large amounts of bottled water at the grocery stores. Is this because of sanitary or mineral content concerns? Should I also be drinking from bottled water or a filtered jug?

2. I am a student at the ICP. I realize since I am 23 years old, will I be eligible for them with my student card from school? Or are there special student discount cards I can apply for? I'd like to save as much as possible while travelling and living in general.

3. I'm an English speaking Canadian with a bachelor's degree. I'd really like to find a part-time job once I know what my class schedule's like. Since I am going to school 21h a week for french class, I also have no experience, and I'd probably prefer something more immersed. Could you guys think of any other jobs I should be looking out for? Also, suggestions for job searching websites would be greatly appreciated.

Thinking the cliche

Figure a basket of sorts, a baguette, and some cheeses (we love our exotic and strange cheeses), any thing else that would be suggested. I'm not too sure what this would cost ideally around 30~40€ and I'd add an extra 20 or so for your trouble. 

So r/Paris I ask for your help making my gf's return to Paris just a bit more magical. I would appreciate any suggestions and any volunteer(s) to help me make this a reality for her.

About us:

I've wanted to visit France most of my life and would like to stay away from most typical touristy things (though I wouldn't mind doing just a few). We are both 25 and live in San Francisco together. We like eating and drinking, movies, mainly hanging out and enjoying life. 


We ideally want to stay at a hotel those first two nights in Paris and was considering the area of Bastille. Is this a good spot for complete Paris newbies? Are there any good inexpensive hotels in that area? If we end up staying there


Near the end of our trip


I like to think of myself as very resourceful

I think I'll still try to go to the Louvre (at least to see the Venus de Milo and Mona Lisa) and also the Eiffel tower.  I've read that handicap people can cut the lines and go through the area for visitors with tickets.  I'm not sure if this would apply to me.

I'll be going in and out of Gare du Nord. I was planning on taking the metro but I read that this is not a good idea on crutches.  Is this correct?  It looks like buses get to all of these places too.

I'm thinking of spending a large chunk of time lingering/people watching at a sidewalk cafe.  It seems that these are a mix of what would be considered restaurants or cafes in the states and I'm not sure if its acceptable to linger there for a while.  In the states if you're at a place with waiter service then they'll push for you to leave right after you finish your meal.  Is this the same there?  Or can I just chill for a while with a coffee and not feel like I'm overextending my stay?

I have a friend doing an internship in Paris, rotten, smells awful and there's a big water leak in her bathroom. The landlord says he's going to ""fix"" things but that it's ok for her to live there in the meantime... But I don't think it is, she can't stand it anymore and it's affecting her badly, she really needs to get out of here to get some rest as she's seriously depressed. She knows absolutely no one in Paris and has barely enough money to pay the rent (that's why she had to live in this shithole in the first place, but it got progresively worse). 

So I guess my question is what could she do in order to spend a couple of nights somewhere else in Paris? She can't afford an hotel and has to stay in the city for work... Maybe couchsurfing or something similar? I have no clue how to help her and she seems desperate

I am moving to Paris to work there for next year (12 months,000 USD but I have the option to raise my scholarship amount if I can prove that it will be difficult for me to live (to an unspecified sum).

Since I have little support from my parents, I would really like your honest input! Do you think 25, 000 USD for one person is fair for a comfortable living in an apartment  (studio or otherwise) in Paris for 12 months? If you had the opportunity to raise the scholarship amount, what would you raise it to? I want to be fair, but I also want to take every opportunity to succeed. 

Other info: 
I don't have many friends in the area, so that's in the budget as well. I'm no big spender, but I'm terrified of being alone in a foreign country and running out of my scholarship money.

So all I'm sure of so far is that I'll be leaving for France sometime in May and I wont be back home in Austin Texas until the end of August. 

Depending on how I get there

I've been talking to some yacht owners (which is super exciting!) about hitching a ride across the Atlantic. So far my best resources for traveling by yacht have been [Cruiser Log](http://www.cruiserlog.com/forums/) and [Find a Crew](http://www.findacrew.net/secure-server/eng/home.asp). I still think it'd be really cool to travel by container ship like [TinTin](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110701020807/tintin/images/1/19/Karaboudjan.jpg) but unfortunately from what I've found through some scant research doing so would be even more costly than traveling by plane - yet traveling by yacht can actually be cheaper

* For the record I don't have much sailing experience and have still found quite a few awesome boaters who are more than ok with that. A lot of them actually really like to teach what they know - awesome group of people cruisers are!

When I do finally get to France I'll be visiting with friends and family for a couple of weeks and that's where I'm at in my plan right now...

**Ideas So Far:** 

* I made [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/1ch9zj/help_me_plan_a_summer_2013_trip_to_france/) in /r/France which has inspired some great ideas

* I think I might spend a month [WWOOFing](http://www.wwoof.org/)

* Or I might do something with the [UCPA](http://www.ucpa-vacances.com/) which is a lot like a summer camp. 

^ Thanks Reddit! I wouldn't have known about any of these things without your help!

In the spirit of [a post by redditor Generique](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/svoy6/need_help_getting_something_done_i_have_unlimited/) I think it would be awesome to help and hangout with some fellow redditors in France or really close to it!

Then of course, got the chance to experience a tiny bit of paris, then we get ready to leave to continue our trip :)

So

""What's the catch ?""

It's simple. I am unemployed at the moment, if not simply to help me get up from bed in the morning.
Let me even more specific: I need a purpose
Meetup and OVS are not enough any more.

About the classes:
I am a TEFL certified instructor, they can be written or oral, focused on fluency or accuracy. I can use pictures, videos, audio from my laptop (I would appreciate if you would bring your own earplugs, for better hygiene :-) ), texts (I own a printer)... newspapers... whatever...
So, but specifically lessons to teach you vocabulary, use of verbs and expressions for everyday situations. Or it can be conversation on any given topic if you want.

Classes are to be held in small groups (max 4 persons for starter), a quiet café would be the perfect spot, or a library.
Please note that I would prefer classes to be held around La Défense

If you feel bad about this whole free stuff, you being my wingman for nights out, whatever. In fact, I can never find people to go to karaoke with, so, who knows ?

Saturday, what's the quickest/most efficient way there?

Thoughts on day 1? Am I missing anything around that area or nearby? Any smaller less famous but neat cool things around? Places to eat along the way not too touristy? Dinner in the 7th?

So I was hoping that some of this would come back as covered under my insurance - I've payed almost half the scooter already in insurance...  Basically, it doesn't qualify as vandalism (not sure what does).  The antivol might be covered if I call the roadside assistance, but apparently not, since the vehicle is within the minimum distance of my apt.  So basically, NOTHING is covered.

The good...

- The architecture of the buildings in the city are amazingly beautiful. 

- People are very friendly. Forget about the stereotypical rude Parisian. They have been nothing but nice and accommodating.

- If you know how to say 'bon jour' and 'merci'

- The wine is delicious. Even if you don't like wine (like myself)

- I hear a lot about scams and pick pocketing

- The night life is great. If you are young and good looking, speaking objectively.

- The coffee is really good


The bad...

- The French are annoyingly polite. We've all heard about it

- Parisians walk fast. Everyone seems to be in a rush to get where they're going. Relax already!

- The touristy sites are crowded (no surprise) and it really takes the specialness out of it.

- If you are overweight

- The beer selection kind of sucks.

- Everyone dresses nice in Paris. That's a bad thing because I don't like to dress up. 

- I've not been that impressed by the food. Go to a diverse city in the U.S.


Summary...

- The best thing abut being in Paris is experiencing the French culture and visiting the historic sites.

- The worst thing about being in Paris is the annoying politeness. That sounds trivial,,False,self,t5_2qkoi,False,,True

I'm a college student ultimately going to Copenhagen

Anyway

* First and foremost: I'm flying into CDG at ~11am local time, or should I immediately go to a different part of the city? 

EDIT: I found [Hotel Eldorado](http://www.eldoradohotel.fr/) on [Yelp](http://www.yelp.com/biz/hotel-eldorado-paris). It sounds great! What do you think of the location? 

* I don't speak French. What I've gathered is that I should learn basic French phrases (""Hello"", I don't speak French"", ""Sorry to bother you"", ""Do you speak English?"", ""Can you help me?"", ""Please"", ""Thank you"", make an effort to use them

* I'm not into touristy stuff. The goal of the trip is to see my friend in Copenhagen -- I chose to come a little early so I could go to France just because. I like to eat and drink and walk around and do nothing. 

* I see you've compiled a list of your favorite bars! What's the attitude towards day drinking? Are there any regional drinks I should try while I'm there?

* Do you have a similar list of recommendations for coffee/simple/cheap food/ etc? I've seen enough dinner-restaurant recommendations on this subreddit

* What's the smoking etiquette? Can I leave butts on the ground like in the US

* Should I stay in Paris the whole time

* What's the weather like in mid-late August? weather.com says mid-seventies at the highest. That would be great

* I generally wear slim-fitted dark jeans and khakis with plain/casual button-down shirts. Leather chukka boots and oxfords in terms of footwear. Overall, I just don't want to be a target.

* Should I get a Metro pass and visit many parts of the city or just find a nice place
