1370646328.0,1fw7y1,My Kingkiller Theory - The beautiful game (Spoiler),chrisss811,88,15,49,"Hi everybody I'm new here and want to share my thoughts and theories with you. 
First off
I have read and heard both books a dozend times. I was researching almost daily new theories of you guys and think I have read almost all of  them all. I'm really hooked on these stuff. I don't think that Patrick Rothfuss has giving us already the key to unravel the story yet

First off I want to call some irrefutable facts which everybody needs to know.

A: Kvothe is the son of Nethalia Lackless:
Ok you remember the end of the rhyme of Arliden about his wife. - not tally a lot less - Nethlia Lackless.
I didn't have the option to unravel this

B: Cinder is denfintly Master Ash. Maybe Bredon is Cinder too because of some 'Glamour-magic'
""Frederick the Flippant. Frank. Feran. Forue. Fordale."" Feran - Fe/ Forue - ru/ Fordale - le - Ferule.
This have to be evidence enough.

Here are my thoughts:

1. Cinder: Cinder is alive! Kvothe is very carefully telling us the story. Carefully in consideration of telling us true Names. He told us Cinders true name once. The first time when Haliax named Cinder
But when the Adem gives him the true names of the Seven
above - Feran, because the
person you name
the blue flame."" But in the story with Tarborlin told from Marten
evidence that he's alive too. 

2. The Silence: I think Kvothe already killed one of the Seven and therefore became one of the Seven. In the discussion between Arliden and Ben about the Chandrian, he maybe is cursed to be one of them, to stuff the hole he made.

3. The thrice-locked-chest: I think the man who is waiting to die
Remember the heavy weight of the box. They say the Chandrian can't die but maybe there is a way (copper?)

4. The beautiful game: Kvothe is setting a trap. A trap for the Seven. The sword Folly
not iron( maybe copper). It cannot fall down from the wall because of the Ruah wood. The Ruah
wood cannot decay. Then there is something with these brass bound barrels. Brass is something
of a copper alloy. Maybe he will stick them in there. But I think there was only three barrels
not seven or six. Hmm? But these things are all prepared for an Chandrian attack(rotting wood, exactly like with those Scraels.
He have chosen a village where almost only old people live. People who have lived there lives
village (Newarre-Nowhere) will die. That is not the way of Bushido
it is for the greater good. But he wanted to save the apprentice and that was Lethani. And this
whole trap - isnt both of it. It is the ""beautiful game"". A trap in a trap etc.


5. Alchemie: Kvothe has lost all magic skills excepting one. There is one magic you dont need body or mental
skills. Alchemie - there for you need knowledge. Alchemie is the form of magic which bored Kvothe
and he didn't learn in his story so far. But we know that he is Alchemie-skilled in the real time.
He knows the Cellum Tinkture etc. He wants Bast to learn Alchemie. I think Alchemie is a big key weapon in fighting the Seven. 

Some Alchemie: Cyphus is related to copper. Cyprus. Cyprus is the Island where Copper came from. Coppers(Cuprum) liguistic origin came from the word Cyprus.
Cinder is related to mercury. Remeber he moves like mercury. Originally the word mercury meant ""living silver"".
Stercus is in thrall of iron. 
I've read a great theorie about the seven alchemie Symbols of the ancient time: 
lead, mercury, iron, copper and finally gold,
I think everyone of the Seven is related to one and is bound with them
iron and Cyphus with copper.And I think they can be used against them. 
Aurum for example means gold in latin. I think Auri is a key to this puzzle too.

The blue fire(or flame): Ok, and the easiest method to produce blue fire is to use copper chloride. Just spread copper chlorid over a campfire(or hearthfire) and the flames will turn blue. (When you burn copper sulphat you will get a blue-green flame). Another important attribute of copper chloride is that it will chorode most metals. Iron corrosion can be precipitated by copper chlorid. Remember that one sign of the Chandrian is rusting iron. This doesn't fit the theorie that every Chandrian is related to one sign, and Stercus seemed related to iron. It's just a thought. Maybe Cyphus or Stercus abstract copper chlorid somehow? Ok, that sounds weird, but in my head it had made more sense. I have read that Patrick Rothfuss studied chemical engineer. I think that Chemie and Alchmie will be very significant in 'Day 3.'

Kvothes weapons against the Chandrian:
(We know that demons fear pure Fire

- Alchemie
- Key
- Coin
- Candle
- Folly(copper
- the Waystone Inn itself:

Tarborlin was in a prison of stone and he only had a coin
Maybe the Waystone Inn is made of big waystones. The Chandrian don't appear near waystones.
Why? We know that waystones standing on safe places. Maybe the Waystones handicap the Chandrian in some way? The VALARITAS-Door is a big waystone too. Kvothe told us about an place called Faeriniel(when he told Sim and Wil the story about Sceop).
He said that this is a place you cannot find when you looking for it. You only can find it when you travel to another place.
I think the Waystone Inn is on this place(Newarre). There often appear travellers like at the 
beginning of TNOTW, or the two soldier at the end of TWMF, etc.
The Waystone Inn attract them like a lodestone. We know that waystones attract people. They draw them somehow magnetic. Maybe waystones don't brickle by an Chandrian attack.

I think the Chronicler is more then he seems. There is something important about him. Yes i know he's a Lochees (Lackless). Maybe at the end oft the story he will be the hero of the KKC. Kvothe tells him the story for a reason.  It is not in Kvothes nature to tell his story just to demystify himself for the afterworld. I think he is part of Kvothes game. The story he tells is a part of his game. He is luring them with his story. 
So what about Bastas? Hmm. Maybe he is not so sympathetic to Kvothe as he claims to be. But Kvothe is too clever and too much of an actor. He is acting infront of Bast and he plays him like a lute. I think Bast is Felrurians child and want something from Kvothe. He want something from Kvothe

By the way
The Symphathie-Crime against Kvothe don't come from Ambrose. I don't think so. Maybe someone else attacked him with his blood. The same thing with these two assassins. Maybe Ambrose don't send them. Someone has his hidden hand on Kvothe since the beginning of the story. Why did Scarpi know his name. Why did Lorren know Arliden. Why did Denna say it's her job to know things about kvothe. Why did Denna appear everywhere Kvothe goes? Why did Threpe flatter on Kvothe? Why did Bredon flatter on Kvothe? Why did sometimes stranges people appear in the story(for example before his ship-journey or when he left Vintas and wanted to throw Meluans ring away). I think Kvothe is watched and controlled by a gray eminence.

The Univesity is not what it seems to be. It is not a place where some teachers are really excited for to teach you powerfull names

Another thing i noticed is that Puppet is allowed to have candles in his room in the library. Maybe Lorren was not flipping because he was in fear that the books catch fire, Air and Earth.

This is a link into the third thread out of seven consecutive such threads on the Song of Ice and Fire forums about Wise Man's Fear. I was reading some of the posts and they had a lot of ideas in that I haven't seen around Reddit


Currently my favourite theory (that in fairness is less theory and more obvious once you can see it) is that Denna has been casting magic for all of the second book. Near the beginning of the book she asks Kvothe's friends how magic works. Specifically she asks about a kind of magic where you write things down and they become true for whoever reads them. She also specified that the things would come true even if the reader didn't understand what he was reading. During the conversation she was drawing symbols on the table with her hand and Kvothe's friends dismissed the idea out of hand without asking questions. Denna seems unperturbed by this and more thoughtful.

Later in the book Denna travels to Yll, Kvothe reads her hair as saying 'lovely' to which Denna appears ""incredulous and slightly horrified"". She quickly takes the knot out her hair and asks Kvothe what he thinks now. He says he liked it better before and she responds that that is the point. She also insists that it is a damn sight more than ""Almost a story knot"" and explains that they are meant to be read by feeling rather than by looking.

The next incident is brief but probably significant. Denna and Kvothe are taking shelter in a hayloft when Kvothe promises not to try to seduce her. She says something to the effect of ""Oh really?"" and begins to tie a knot in her hair

Finally, claiming that he is not so thick as to not take such an obvious sign, but as soon as she realises what she has done she removes the knot again and Kvothe immediately speaks to her to give her ring back.

All of this considered

The final point to be made about this theory is that Herme falls ill shortly after he promises to teach Kvothe Yllish. This could be a sign that someone doesn't want Kvothe to understand Denna's knots



The other significant discussion that I don't think has been mentioned here before is the discussion about Selitos. The evidence for anything about him is much less concrete, it was probably made out of wood from the Rhinna tree where the Cthaeh resides. This fits in nicely because it is quite possible that the box contains the piece of obsidian that Selitos took his eye out with. He uses the blood on the Obsidian to curse Lanre so it could be hidden away to make sure Lanre can't acquire it and break his curse. If Selitos did turn out to be evil then it could be that he was the one who poisoned the seven Chandrian into becoming evil but, as in Denna's song, Lanre saw through his plan and marched on his cities. This would explain why the seventh city didn't burn, since it was Lanre's city. The ""Evil Selitos"" Theory is backed up by the girl with the charm telling Kvothe that when she saw the Chandrian with an Amyr, the Amyr was the scariest of all of them.

The box also raises a few other interesting subjects. One of the childrens' rhymes contains the line ""lackless keeps her husband's rocks"". Kvothe seems to think that the box only contains one item, so it could be that it is locked with an Yllish knot. 

I feel I have given way to rambling a bit - I am not good at organising my ideas. As a result,"" I said bitterly. ""I swear it on my name and my power. I swear it by my good left hand. I swear it by the ever-moving moon."" "" Kvothe appears to have a significant latent talent for naming. As a result, he could also have some talent for shaping. One of the most popular theories everywhere is that Kvothe eventually kills Cinder. There is a lot of evidence to suggest that Cinder is Master Ash, and if he were then Kvothe would need to hunt him down to kill him. In the interludes at the Waystone Inn Kvothe appears to have lost his power and there are a number of scenes where his left hand is specifically mentioned as not working properly. Bast worries that he has lost who he is, which could be explained by him somehow losing his name, so this oath to Denna could be at least part of the reason for how he ended up as weak as he is in the present day.

I know that the most argue they don't like who Kvothe becomes when he is around her or that she shows up unexpectedly everywhere or that she is flakey all the time but I love that about her. The way Pat sets up and progresses their relationship is my favorite part of the narrative. 

The moment that hooked me into the series hardest was the way she talked to Kvothe and depended on him in Trebon when she is all high and loopy. That's what got me really really invested in those two. Then came the chapter with the Cthaeh telling him how she cries for him at night and I had to put the book down and take a break otherwise I

At this point finding out what became of Denna and their relationship in the frame story is what I'm reading for.

But I thought you guys might find it interesting

It was midmorning, one hand resting lightly on his sword.

The taproom was empty except for a dark-haired young man lounging behind the bar. “Can I help you?”

Jaime stepped inside. “I’m looking for the owner. We have… business.”

The young man stood up straighter. “He’s stepped out for a moment. You’re Jaime?”

Jaime frowned slightly as he looked the young man over. “I am. And you are?”

“Bast.” The young man said with a grin. “He said I’m to make you comfortable if you showed up early. He shouldn’t be more than an hour or two. Can I get you something to drink?”

Jaime moved to sit at the bar. “I don’t suppose you have any decent wine out here in the ass end of nowhere?”

“What do you mean by decent?” Bast asked.

Jaime waved a hand dismissively. “Why don’t you bring out your best bottle? I’ll tell you if it’s something worth drinking.”

Bast looked offended as he headed down the basement stairs

“Something off the top shelf

“Something from behind the shelf, it’s the good stuff.”

Bast worked a corkscrew and opened the bottle with a deft flourish. Then he brought out a tall wineglass

Jaime made no motion to take it. “You drink half.”

Bast glanced down at the glass

Jaime showed his teeth in a sharp, “that you aren’t willing to drink it.”

Bast gave a dismissive sniff,” Bast said, pouring more into the glass. “That’s just lovely.”

Jaime shrugged. “Ah well

Bast brought the glass close to his chest

Jaime’s expression went dark. “I’m not here for you

They stared at each other for a while across the bar. After a moment, nudging it so it slid forward. “I won’t insult you by offering you a glass or anything. I could poison that, too. You’ll just have to drink it right from the bottle…” Bast grinned. “Like an unlettered cretin.”

Jaime picked up the bottle. “Boy, paused, and took another slower drink as if to make sure of something. He looked surprised. “Well, that is good, isn’t it?”

Bast nodded and took another sip.

“Did he say when he’ll be back?”

Bast looked down at his feet. “A couple hours

“Don’t look so glum

Bast looked up and his eyes were anxious. “I don’t suppose I could convince you to call this off?”

Jaime gave a humorless laugh and took another drink. “Good lord

“Human decency?” Bast said.

Something about this struck the golden-haired man as funny, boy.” He shook his head in disbelief and took another drink.

“It’s just that…” Bast began.

“Look

Jamie took another drink from the bottle before continuing. “You see, he lost long ago.” He looked around the empty inn. “He wouldn’t be hiding here if he still had a scrap of power to call his own.”

Bast looked dejected

“I’ll offer him a chance to surrender.” Jaime said magnanimously. “As thanks for this excellent bottle of wine.” He took one last drink and pushed it away from himself on the bar. “That’s enough of that. Start to turn my head

“He might surprise you.” Bast said.

“With what?” Jaime said

“I need to show you something

Jaime turned his shoulders

“Never mind

“Why can’t I move my legs?” Jaime said

Bast approached where the big man lay

“It was in the wine

“You think I wouldn’t drink poison for him?” Bast asked. “Then you don’t know anything about him.”

Bast met the man’s glassy eyes. “You’re right. He’s not what he used to be. He’s lost everything. No magic. No music. No joy. No hope. You know what he has? You know what’s left?” Bast leaned closer

*EDIT. Forgot to convert Kj to j. Changed figures throughout to correct after peer review.
*
So I was re-reading The Wise Man's Fear

During his tuition interview

Kvothe answers: 180 Thaums. Which is reckoned a ""Good-enough"" answer by one of the Masters.

Assuming an ounce is the same as 'our' ounce (given we are dealing with liquids

1 ounce(fl) = 0.02957 L of water ≅ 0.02957 kilograms (**m**ass)

**L**atent heat of vaporization of water = 2260 KJ/Kg.

**Q**(energy)=**L****m**

Q=(0.02957)(2

Q=66

180 Thaums ≅ 67

**1 Thaum ≅ 370 Joules**

In the Name Of The Wind

850,400,000,000 Joules

The bone-tar came in a container that Kvothe calls ""a... cylinder... about four feet high and two across.""

Formula for volume of a cylinder;

V = π r^2 h

Converted to metric we get

V = (π)(.3)^2 (1.22)

V = 0.345 m^3

Comparing this volume to the heat produced by the combustion of the bone-tar

If 0.345m^3 of bone-tar releases 3.145x10^11 Joules of heat

(or 917 MJ/L)

(However this estimate is on the low side, both of which are not true. But the true figure should be roughly in the same ballpark.)

Comparing this to a chemical we have a lot of everyday experience with like petrol

Petrol has an energy density of 4.73x10^7 J/Kg

This gives 1m^3 of petrol an energy density of around 3.964x10^10 J/m^3 (I'm doing a good bit of rounding, but I've found a lot of differing values elsewhere for the different physical properties of petrol.)

This means that for the same volume

~~To give you a better idea
~~It doesn't look as dangerous as it ounce did

The much speculated upon point that Taborlin's key, would be an improbable coincidence.

When Bast and Chronicler are trying to encourage Kvothe regarding the Cthaeh, because Bast is over 100 years old if memory serves, and Chronicler had already written his book about the draccus when Kvothe was 15.

&gt;&gt;Note: I'm not saying that Arliden=Iax

&gt;.  
&gt;First off
.  
&gt;With that said, but they always turn lighter in color, going fully blue then eventually white, which is pretty much the opposite of what Kvothe's do. However there was an interesting story told to Kvothe by Felurian. In this story she told him of the Fae's history and happened to mention a certain person with ""dark and changing eyes"": Iax.  

&gt;&gt;*Before I could ask more questions

&gt;.  
&gt;So
.  
&gt;Well, being the young curious Lady Lackless who would eventually end up spending the rest of her life with a bunch of story collectors, at some point became a bit too interested in the riddle of her families storied ""Lockless Door"", and much like her son she had a knack for getting into places where she shouldn't be.  
.  
&gt;I think this entire story is actually hidden in a song in the early parts of the first book. Kvothe apparently hears a little girl chanting the song and then recites it for us
.  
&gt;&gt;Song #1  
1. *""Seven things has Lady Lackless*  
2. *Keeps them underneath her black dress*  
3. *One a ring that’s not for wearing*  
4. *One a sharp word
5. *Right beside her husband’s candle*  
6. *There’s a door without a handle*  
7. *In a box
8. *Lackless keeps her husband’s rocks*  
9. *There’s a secret she’s been keeping*  
10. *She’s been dreaming and not sleeping*  
11. *On a road
12. *Lackless likes her riddle raveling.*  
.  
&gt;&gt;Song #2  
1. *""Seven things stand before*  
2. *The entrance to the Lackless door*  
3. *One of them a ring unworn*  
4. *One a word that is forsworn*  
5. *One a time that must be right*  
6. *One a candle without light*  
7. *One a son who brings the blood*  
8. *One a door that holds the flood*  
9. *One a thing tight-held in keeping*  
10. *Then comes that with comes with sleeping""* 
 
&gt;.  
&gt;Before I go further I should say what I think the songs are about. Song #2 I believe explains what is required to open the Lockless Door and its last line is about what is beyond the door. Song #1 I've concluded is the actual story of a Lady Lackless going beyond said door in secret.  
.  
&gt;That's probably not good enough
.  
&gt;Lines 1 and 2 are referencing that Lady Lackless does indeed have the seven things required for the door
Lines 3 - 8 are just pointing out what each thing is
Line 9 again points out that she is keeping it secret
Lines 10 and 11 mirror the final line of song #2. I think beyond the door is some dream-like state or place (Doors of Stone analogous to the Doors of the Mind?)
Line 12 probably has some double meaning, the riddle bit being that she is setting him up to be or be seen as a Ruh. It could even mean that she made this song herself.

&gt;I think an important part of what's locking Kvothe's magic away is that he is no longer Kvothe - he's Kote. Bast as much as says this a few times, but that this is exactly the problem with Kote - Kvothe's gone, and Kote doesn't think he's coming back.

&gt;What gives this credence is the panicked reaction that Elodin has when Kvothe brings up the matter of changing names. Elodin's immediate thought is that Kvothe or Fela, but is Sleeping Name. He removed everything that made him Kvothe the Arcane, Kvothe Bloodless, Maedre of Lightning, Flame and Broken Tree, and perhaps even Kvothe of the Ruh, who was to be the next Illien. He owns property, and perhaps even his ear for music. Can you imagine one moment of foolishness

&gt;Kvothe is not sitting in that inn, his Alar is broken, and no music fills his soul. All that was cut away, leaving only a shell. The box that he made (we assume) no longer answers to Kote.

&gt;What's curious to me is that he seems to have retained his understanding of the Lethani - he not only remembered Adem hand-combat in his bout with the mercenaries

Alright, one cadaver's heart can make a little hole in an aorta a thousand meters away, and it'll just look like a heart attack if it's done right. Presumably, the long and arduous career of most gillers acts as a way to weed out people of poor moral fiber (not that it seems to work for Ambrose or Hemme), and Master Dal, in particular, is very sensitive to the need to protect and defend the reputation of artifcery. But every system is fallible, or a poisoner who never fails

And then an awful thought occurred to me. What if Kvothe didn't name-shape himself? What if the function of the Master Namer is not to just to guide students into becoming namers

If Kvothe killed the/a/some King in a public and brutal display of malfeasance (and the stones are reportedly still cracked where it happened), the right man, to strip away the ability to name, the gift of sympathy, and the power of Alar? To make Kvothe as if he had never been - no more than a legend, dead in his time? We know that Elodin is a very gifted Namer, and that he probably has the chops to pull something if it needed to be done - and the wisdom to know when and where it needed to happen.

&gt;""'Things are too full of life in the spring months. In the summer


I thought this was a pretty straightforward admission by Kvothe about his life. ""Too full of life"" in the Spring to die, tired and waiting to die.  
  

&gt;He looked down at his hands, he lifted and spread them, as if warming them by the fire. They were graceful, with long, delicate fingers. He watched them intently, as if expecting them to do something on their own. Then he lowered them to his lap, one hand lightly cupping the other, motionless


So


Then, 


&gt; The flare of flame revealed them all briefly


And I remember a lot of Kvothe's old scars never really leaving traces behind aside from the silver lines. Sounds like he's been punctured rather violently at some point we don't know about. 


Later,  


&gt;“How odd to watch a mortal kindle
Then to dwindle day by day.
Knowing their bright souls are tinder
And the wind’ will have its way.
**Would I could my own fire lend.**
What does your flickering portend?”


At first I thought this was just Bast being sad that Kvothe is mortal. While I still think it confirms that Kvothe is mortal and not Chandrian or any of those other theories


&gt;“Devan. Devan Lochees.”
Kote stopped polishing the bar and looked up. “**Lochees? Are you related to Duke...”** Kote trailed off


I totally missed this my first read-through. DUH. Chronicler is a Lockless relative. 


Take a look at Chronicler's reaction to Kvothe's prodding:


&gt;Kote nodded, and he swallowed the first words that came to his lips. He struggled for a moment to recapture his calm demeanor.


Ha. Maybe Kvothe's short temper is a Lockless trait. Meluan is surely familiar with it!

I don't really have anything to back this up with. It's all speculation

The question of why Elodin would use his admissions question to tease Kvothe about playing cards poorly

Having a bad night playing cards seems like a pretty insignificant occurrence. It seems unlikely that Manet, let alone one of the masters, about it. So how does Elodin know?

I'm thinking Elodin and Manet are one and the same. Some things to think on:

* Elodin obviously knows something about changing one's own name. His reaction when Kvothe asks him about it speaks for itself.

* Elodin is constantly urging his naming students to shed logic in order to see.

* I can't recall ever seeing Manet and Elodin in the same place at the same time. (Please correct me if I'm wrong about this)

What if Elodin, but is unable to make the two whole again. When he removed his logical self, he went ""mad,"" but it became incredibly easy for him to know and see names.

The other masters are all smart. They wouldn't have thrown Elodin in the special cell in the crockery if they thought he'd be able to get out. After they put him there

When he changed his name to be Manet

Elodin is constantly late to things never (minus giving Fela her ring) wears his Master's Robes. Everyone seems to attribute it to his oddness

The other Masters would of course, he isn't given the opportunity to accept or decline. It just happens.

If this is the case and the Masters did know, as he's leaving, Elodin takes the chance to encourage Kvothe to truly chase the wind while he's away.

As JWrundle pointed out, Cold/Black Eyes, Rot, Mute, Blight (presumably failed crops, not rotting wood), and Haliax's Shadows.  That makes only six Chandrian w/o Haliax, because kvothe gets told by the girl 'a man getting bitten by a dog'.

Secondly about the Chandrian, Kvothe mentions a book that states this.  He disregards it out of hand, but really it makes a lot of sense.  Haliax was forged in a time of turmoil and war right?  And many empires had fallen, it fits.  Further, its a counterpoint to the seven angels created by Aleph/Tehlu.

Ahhh

Haliax tells Cinder that he is but a tool in his hand

Lastly, but my guess is that they become important.

Now

She can speak in the Adem hand-sign-language.  It mentions her making and odd fidgeting motion when talking to kvothe, so it would make sense there.  And then Kvothe notices the ring gone, so i dont think it was her habit of messing with her ring; thats just what he notices gone.

She can do the Knot-tying language

""Its my job to notice things about you""

Denna is old.  Really old.  I think she may be related to the 'Singers' (on account of her voice), she may be a spy for Haliax, hard to say if shes on the good side or the bad from the first two books.  There is the problem of their meeting though.  Denna seems pretty genuinely lost in purpose, just scraping by.  Its shown too much to be just a cover.  My best explanation is that shes a sort of 'sleeper agent' and the peculiarities are just subconscious, of perhaps if she is a spy for Haliax, she got possessed after meeting Kvothe.  (Again, why not start watching him while he was in Tarbean?  Why wait?)

One of the themes of WMF is that the lines aren't some black and white and the Amyr aren't necessarily storybook heroes. (Duke of Gebea) Their creed is ""for greater good"" and using a poor girl merely looking for a sponsor in an almost experimental way that in all probability will get her killed seems suitably fitting for what we know of them.

&gt;*See a woman pale as snow?    
Silent come and silent go.

Chandrian.  Chandrian.*

Now, I do believe that she has something to do with them, and not just via connection to Master Ash (who many believe to be Cinder).  

First, but I believe that the verse she sings is left there for the reader.  

Denna is described as being ""pale as the moon.""  We are all well aware of the fact that she tends to come and go with little or no warning.  She fits into the first two lines that she sings in the same way the moon fits into the sky.  Those lines absolutely define some of the key attributes of Denna.  

It is my opinion that Denna, or of major events unfolding around the Chandrian.  Like the blue flame is (seemingly) Cinder's sign, or like the shadow-hame is Haliax's sign, somehow Denna herself is a sign of the Chandrian.

Let me know what you think.  Sorry this was such a lengthy post.  

TL;DR: Denna is a sign of the Chandrian

I'm gonna start off from the start. We all know there is the theory that Bredon may be Cinder. I'm building off that. So to start: When K first meets Bredon

Another thing that catches my eye is that in their first meeting, or just talking about foiling his plans because he knows or has an idea about what he is to become (as I believe Skarpi did when he called out his name in Tarbean.)

This is not my main point tonight

*  Bredon has a staff that has a *silver* wolfs head. I can't find any relation to that. If you do


*  Bredon seems to make a point of not giving his rank while making it seem like it is in K's best interest


*  Bredon has a staff/walking stick just like Master Ash.


kv*  Bredon is rumored to be seen participating in ""pagan rituals"" on the outskirts of town (I personally believe this is him travelling between the wastone (maybe the same one K and Denna sit at when she plays her song for him) or communicating with the other Chandrian)


Anyway

**My real point here tonight:**

Chapter 67 in WMF

This is when Bredon beats K several more times at Tak and K thinks he is getting close to winning. Bredon gets angry and shows him how he isn't even *close* to beating him. And I quote:

""You've been going easy on me.""

""No

""What then?""

""I am trying to make you understand the game

Here's where it gets good now:
'
*He tapped the board with two fingers.* ""Any man that's half awake can spot a trap that's laid for him. But to stride in boldly with a plan to turn it on its ear, then beat them. That is twice marvelous.""

Okay. This is what struck me. The whole setting a trap and knowing someone will come in wary and still beating them. Supposing Bredon is in fact Cinder, Kvothe finds the bandits (presumably Bredon/Cinder knew that the Maer would send him or even influenced that decision) and he goes in wary, but it's just a trap. Not a trap to catch him, but to spot him/find him out. Cinder literally sees that Kvothe is there and takes the fuck off.

So my question to you is do you think Cinder (one of the most cruel if not the most cruel of the Chandrian) is considering this playing a beutiful game and having a fun way of ""playing with"" Kvothe (see above

Loren is Amyr.  When Kvothe is talking to Simmon in Tomes and showing him the book of physiology from the duke who killed all those people

1- If you try to remove yourself from history

2- There are the agents of the archives who go out and hunt for books. They meet one in the waiting room.  The gentleman out to chase down books is armed and has the look of an adventurer rather than a scholar. I get that roads are dangerous, it just seemed like overkill for book buying, but perhaps suitable it was suitable for tracking specific books and recovering/eliminating them. This could be an extended function of the Amyr's goals to hide themselves.

3- Loren keeps Kvothe out of the library for a year

4- Loren is renowned for having a hell of a poker face. Or rather being emotionless. If you want someone to infiltrate the university as an Amyr and stay secretive you would need someone who is a tremendous actor and who is always in control of their emotions. 

5- Loren just seems very calm and calculating. He is the kind of person who would view the world the way an Amyr does. A utilitarian and orderly system where the greatest good is served even if that involves some nasty stuff. 

6- I also suspect Puppet knows some things about the Amyr,  the Amyr. 

None of these by themselves really mean much


The second member is Bredon. Regardless of wether or not he is Master Ash as well

1- The Cthaeh tells Kvothe that the Maer has come close to the Amyr though he doesn't know it. He also tells Kvothe that staying close to Alveron will bring him to the Amyr

2- Sure, and the Maer's court is certainly important enough. 

3- More importantly, it makes sense to have an Amyr close by to swoop in when he gets a lead and get their first to keep it secret from him and the world. 

4- Bredon is keeping tabs on Alveron for the reasons above. Kvothe wanders in as a bonus

--- He comes to play Tak, especially with Kvothe searching stories for his ""book,"" he still doesn't get a handle on where Bredon ranks, so he is probably not from an old family or an established part of the court. I am guessing he is wealthy and from elsewhere. Someone would have to be pretty influential or talented to maintain secrecy or this kind of artful hide-in-plain sight trick in this situation. How does someone as smart and as inquisitive as Kvothe get stymied by trying to find out the station of Bredon?  

---If you are trying to get the measure of someone, and that insight allowed him to beat them. Bredon is playing Tak to learn Kvothe's style, temperament and personality. 

--This approach reeks of a beautiful game. Sure Bredon could have Kvothe killed or pushed off the path easily

---He is keeping his eye on Denna. If he is indeed Master Ash. I think he plays with Denna solely as a way to influence and learn more about Kvothe.  He beats her because it will drive her to Kvothe all the more readily. She has value for the control she exerts over K--she is a lever attached directly to his rudder. Or maybe Ash/Bredon is after her because she is the moon (as some suggest.) We also know Denna is important in the scheme of things because she is one of the things the Cthaeh chooses to focus on. Remember, and Kvothe says it's being shot like an arrow into the future, but Bast says it is more dangerous because an arrow only hits one person, and the Cthaeh wants to hurt everyone. Remember, the Cthaeh is described as totally malevolent, so he will want to hurt the world as much as possible. Kvothe blames himself for the worsening of the world. We don't know all of the details, but we know he feels responsible. Which subjects set Kvothe off? The Chandrian

I see Bredon as a spider in the center of a web. When it comes to keeping the Amyr secret who could be a greater threat than two curious people, stubborn and used to traveling far and wide? It makes sense for an Amyr to be keeping tabs on both of them.  It's even possible that Caudecus was poisoning Alveron as part of this. perhaps to keep him from being well enough to pursue the Amyr but healthy enough to be useful to the Amyr's pursposes. K may have stopped them, or perhaps it was set up as a way of getting Kvothe into Alveron's good graces. That one's shaky at best, but I'm throwing it out there.

4. The Sithe keep it sequestered from the rest of the world. Now, and attempt to have as much contact with the world as possible, only to end it all at once, before anyone realizes what is happening. It's a bit unlikely that there was no point in Cthae's existence when it could have persuaded everyone that it was in fact benevolent. 

5. It seems to dislike the Chandrian

6. Assuming any great namer ever came to it who any possible future had their own name discovered (by themselves or someone else) why didn't Cthae simply enslave them and directly influence the world?


All these things combined lead me to believe that Cthae actually has a plan that has been going on for a while now

This is my attempt at combining all of the stories into a cohesive narrative. Recently finished a re-read and this is a stream of consciousness tinfoil hat theory about the nature of the Four Corners.

Long ago Aleph began to discover the names of all things. Aleph was the first to do so and soon became very powerful in his knowledge. He was arrogant in his power and began create many things with his power. Other saw this and discovered that they too could find the names of things and bend them to their wills. The most powerful of these Namers were Aleph, and Iax. As more and more individuals found their power and the desire to create things a new landscape came into being and was called the Fae.

As the most powerful Namer, the situation escalated and ended in her death.

After this, these included Selitos and Lyra. Iax however refused to stop his manipulation of the world and many flocked to his banner. The Namers collectively sought to prevent a conflict. The Namers came to realize that their creations did not grow, change, or change as did things from the natural world. Some of these creations had absorbed the intentions and emotions of their creators in a primal and imperfect way as the understanding of the creators were also imperfect. What resulted in some instances were innocent enough, trees with extraordinary properties. Some were possessed of an all consuming lust. Others manifested a pure and utter malevolence as the intent of their creators was to poison and reduce the creations of others.

The Namers resolved to divide the Shaped lands from the natural world and in the faen realm the Shapers were free to exercise their will. This arrangement lasted until Iax pulled the moon partially into the Fae realm. After this tragic event the war began in earnest. The Shapers created armies of monstrosities that poured out of the Fae and wreaked havoc on the people of the world.

In that time there were 7 great cities and Myr Tariniel, Namers used their skill to create weapons of enduring quality for the warriors.

The greatest of these warriors was named Lanre, and the creations possessing and killing the people, and their wretchedness as a result of a lifetime of cruelty were abhorrent to him. He sought out the Shapers and Knowers responsible for the cruelty inflicted upon the world. The Knowers were unwilling or unable to destroy Iax and so commissioned traps that they might seal him away forever.

Tehlu continued his crusade to free the people of the world traveling to each of the cities, Lanre heard of a flower in the Fae that could cure anything. He traveled there and was told of a power he could use to revive Lyra.

Here is where I ran out of developed ideas. He somehow became Iax through changing his name

Tehlu became a folk hero.

The Six leaders of the fallen cities joined Lanre/Iax. They went to Selitos for help but he condemned them. The Fae realized they may be destroyed and worked to destroy the creatures of the war. They learned the nature of the Cthaeh and sought to end all influence in the world. These fae warriors became the Sithe.

The last city, Aleph emerged from his hermitage to put a final end to the conflict. He removed much of the power of naming from the world and changed the nature of the world and its people. Much of this power was invested in Tehlu and his followers but removed them from the world.

Selitos founded the Amyr bent on avenging the deeds done by Lanre and the Six. Ferula somehow pissed off the Cthaeh, and changed by the power of Selitos, Lyra dead, and Selitos himself stripped of much power, Aleph removed himself from the world taking with him much of the power of naming, in the hopes that nothing like the Creation War would happen again. With Tehlu removed from the world, some people began to worship him and started a religion.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/1b2ud4/the_creation_war_spoilers_heresy_and_rampant/

This one's been stuck in my head for a while. The ""Telwyth Mael"" part seems grammatically ambiguous
1. Prince of Twilight and Prince of the Telwyth Mael  
2. The Telwyth Mael  
  
We don't know enough to know whether the Telwyth Mael is a place or a title. 

One hint we get is that ""the Mael"" is referred to in a couple places:

NotW:

&gt;Bast shook his head. “It seemed like one of the Mahael-uret,’” he said indignantly. “The Mael doesn’t even share a border with us. It’s as far away as anywhere can be in the Fae.” Kvothe nodded a hint of an apology. “I just assumed you knew what it was. You didn’t hesitate to attack it.” “All snakes bite, Reshi. I don’t need their names to know they’re dangerous. I recognized it as being from the Mael. That was enough.”

WMF:
&gt; Bast went very still. “What did I do, making a dismissive gesture. “I just slowed it down, Reshi. That’s all.”  

and
   
&gt; Felurian was more than willing to talk about the Fae realm itself. And many of her stories detailed the fractious politics of the faen courts: the Tain Mael

and

&gt; Felurian left similar details out of her stories. Who wouldn’t know

It seems as if ""the Mael"" is part of the fae, what does Bast have to do with it? ""It doesn't even share a border with us"" he says.

A recent (somewhat redundant) post about this got me thinking though. What if the ""seven years"" part of the saying is as important as the *Kote* bit? What if disaster does actually strike every seven years? We already know the number Seven bears major significance. The obvious touchstone, three years in Tarbaen, and now he's been enrolled in the University for about two and a half(??) years, with some of that time spent in Vintas and Ademre. That's a really rough guess but I'm pretty certain it's been less than seven years, but not by much, meaning we will probably get to that point in The Doors of Stone. 

The imminent disaster could be any number of terrible things that are theorized to be the ""tragedy"" that seems to be coming. But I also wonder if it could mean the Chandrian strike in full force every seven years (I'm not sure that all of them were at Trebon). The more alluring thing to me is if you combine the Aturan and Siaru versions of the phrase

I guess I'm sorting of grasping at straws but I'd never really given much thought to the ""Seven years"" part of Kilvin's saying. 

TL;DR: Lots of tinfoil. Kilvin says we should expect disaster every seven years

I apologize if this has already been addressed (It would be great if you could point me to a link!).  

My theory is that Kvothe has a significant amount of Fae blood.  To my mind, especially given that these are fairly science-heavy fantasy books), his eyes changing color to reflect his emotions (The only other characters this happens to are Felurian and Bast), and the fact that he heals very quickly.  Plus, it could possibly explain his physical and mental prowess?  I would suggest that one of his parents was Fae (see Arliden's comment to Laurien in NotW that she must have bedded down with a wandering God), but then I don't see where his Edema Ruh features would have come from.  I find the Cthaeh's comment that his mother held up to Cinder's torture much better than his father interesting in this context, too ... does it imply his mother was part Fae and therefore more capable of withstanding torture?

If Kvothe is part Fae, that possibility is out).  However, I think it is more likely that Bast is his grandfather (e.g., Laurien's father).  I know the theory they are related is not new, but I haven't seen much speculation on the extent to which Kvothe really is ""a little fae around the edges"" so I thought I'd see what others think about this.

B) How old is the Chronicler?

Plus lots of supporting evidence for the Auri-is-the-moon theory.",MenWhoStareAtG0ATSE,34,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/vetkf/my_self_indulgent_thread_of_theories_some_have/

I'll lead with my theory that I think is least likely to have been mentioned in here before: I think Kvothe unknowingly used grammarie when he made that ""charm"" for the little girl from Trebon. She had nightmares about the Chandrian

____________________

Auri. I think she's the moon. I know a lot of people think it's Denna. A few think it's Auri; I hope to expand on this. And by hope I mean I hope these ideas have not already been brought up, and she was so excited when he 'gave her a new one.' 

More important and more compelling are the circumstances surrounding Elodin's decision to take Kvothe on as a student. In the admissions interview Elodin asks an absurdly easy question and then

The next time Kvothe and Elodin meet is on the rooftops with Auri. Pat is a cunning writer, Kvothe is able to see Elodin's expression because the moon peaks out from behind a cloud. This is -- significantly -- the same scene where Elodin decides to take Kvothe under his wing. I think the temporal sequence and the content of these two meetings is strongly suggestive.

By way of further evidence

*I heard the faint, ""Kvothe?""*

*I looked to my right and saw her small shape standing a dozen feet away. The clouds were hiding the moon

All this happens *just* as a storm is sweeping in over K's head. So it's not unreasonable to assume that the clouds had been hiding the moon for a very short period of time -- say, but that sentence sounds conspicuously like what someone with a bird's eye view would say. Or, the moon, if you will. Think about it.

Finally, as Auri inhabits a hole beneath Mains, it also explains why there would ever be a building so dreadfully designed. After all, Jax didn't know how to use the folding house and all sorts of pieces ended up in the wrong places. This segues smoothly into my next, much less thoroughly supported theory.

___________________

I think that, evidenced in the drawing given to K by the little girl from Trebon. Above Haliax's likeness was a picture of the moon in different phases. This one is less of a theory and more of a wild guess. Whatever.

___________________________

Staying within the parameters of ""less a theory than a groundless guess"" I suspect Lanre/Haliax (Jax?) is actually a good guy. Evidently the rest of the Chandrian are sadistic assholes, which is not typical of an epic fantasy Big Bad. If this were the case, it would raise the question of why they must kill people for talking about them. It's a fair counter point. But if they're so scared of the ""Singers, the Sithe, the Amyr,"" then it stands to reason that they need to take extreme measures sometimes. 

Frankly the Amyr are just as scary as the Chandrian, and I havent gotten to that part yet in my reread of Wise Man's Fear.

It's is generally accepted that the Lackless sister is Kvothe's mother. Evidence: ""Not tally a lot less""

Manet's glare. 

If Kvothe wasn't a bastard he would be ahead of Ambrose.

Some more facts. Kvothe kills a king. Kvothe fakes his own death very convincingly and becomes someone else.

Well I believe this action has to be a conscious action done by at least part of Kvothe's mind. 
The two times we see Kote become Kvothe he went to bed first.  The first time was when he went out to lure the skrailings.  PR does a good job of explaining that Kote locks up early
The second time is when he takes the ""perfect step"" in the epilogue.  ""and it was in the hands of the man who wore the bruises as he rose stiffly from his bed

-The Four Plate door is locked, in the four copper plates
-The copper door in Elodin’s cell &gt; later copper mesh added to walls after he escapes once
-Elodin destroys the stone around the copper mesh
-Copper is used for the sygaldry in Ambrose's window and Anker's fridge
-When K is examining the Loeclos box, he guesses iron and copper

A theory (yes another one) of what copper does

He slouched onto the couch. “You see, and candle. Furthermore, his cell had no door worth mentioning. No window that could be breached.” He made dismissive gestures at each of these. “Even the name of the wind was hidden from him by the clever machinations of his captors.”

Pat has been known to put stuff like this out in the open before, or that it simply hides the name of the wind. Odd that copper would hide the name of the wind, but no more odd than copper not having a name at all. I personally hope copper is somewhat of a red hearing. It is not special in any other way other than the fact it is used in sygaldry and is a sign of sygaldry. Which of course could very well be used to repress powers of naming or otherwise iie?

Kvothe poisons the stew **before** he gets to meet the kidnapped girls(I guess he does it when he goes to taste it before the others). Also he says he'll join them ""Until no one objects to my leaving.” This means he already planned to kill them.

So what would have happened if it turned out they didn't have any kidnapped girls and were decent people? They pretended to be Ruh but they just took the wagons when the original troupers were killed. That's a bit bad but it's *understable*.

Some quotes:

&gt;“So you killed them for pretending to be Edema Ruh?”
&gt;“For pretending to be Ruh? No.” I put the iron back in the fire. “For killing a Ruh troupe and stealing
&gt;their wagons? Yes. For what they did to you? Yes.”

Althought there's a slight contradiction later on

&gt;even though I’d already known. There was no
other way these people could have come by a pair of Edema wagons with their markings intact.

So my question is.. what would have happened if they were nice people pretending to be Ruh? Everyone's poisoned

When Skarpi meets Kvothe

So all things considered

1. Interest to be developed in Kvothe
2. Someone who knows Kvothe in Tarbean
3. Skarpi

The only person who has reason enough for 1 is Abenthy, Skarpi, who has to know both of them to be able to set Kvothe back on his original path of revenge and greatness. All of this seems suggest that Trapis too, is not who he seems to be, and a member of some group to which the other two belong (Amyr, angels etc). This group has to have a reasonable amount of influence if Skarpi is so utterly unperturbed on being caught by the Tehlin guards. In a state that is at least partly a theocracy, you have to be someone special to just brush aside what could potentially be blasphemy.

The next logical question is, so I'll leave it at this. What do you think?

The Adem's lives, but it's not a path.* Their teachings abound with lessons of the deeper meaning that everything possesses. *Is Sheyhen's hat beautiful? What makes something beautiful?*

My first read through, and Kvothe is an outsider that just barely proves he's worth teaching. They have decidedly unusual sexual practices. Then I got to the part about ""man-mothers,"" scratched my head, and moved on.

But my subsequent read-throughs helped me to understand the depth of what Rothfuss was trying to convey as I read the chapters Kvothe spends with the Adem. The subtlety. The ""Spinning Leaf"" mind state that Kvothe probably wouldn't have taught himself or needed anywhere else. The infallible Lethani.

And then I came to the part about ""man-mothers"" again. **Man Mothers.** Even with their combat prowess, and the unquestionability of the Lethani, Rothfuss incorporates a hysterical ineptitude when it comes to even the most basic understanding of the function a man and a woman serve in the creation of a child. Why?

Why would Rothfuss have added a part that any reader would identify as idiocy into a segment of the book that described characters that seemed so unmarred?

The thrice-locked box contains the name Kvothe. Here's why I think that:  

1. At the end of WMF, Kvothe is just talking about Denna, but Elodin's reaction suggests that one may be able to change their own name, the very essence of who they are.  

2. Kote is starting to seem a lot different than Kvothe. They're the same person, whereas Kvothe is obviously a driven hero. Though he writes that off as just having gotten sick of the whole hero life, etc., It could be because he locked that part of him away, and as a result, can no longer call upon the power or the mindset.   

Why would Kvothe do this? For the same reason he's hiding, the people around him safer, and to make himself more difficult to find.

Recall that in chapter 2 of tWMF Kvothe tried to persuade the young boy Aaron not to enlist by revealing his true identity (or at least the name by which Kote became famous).
The boy obviously didn't bielieve Kote

&gt; On his first hand he wore rings of stone
&gt; Iron, and bone.
&gt; There were rings unseen on his second hand.
&gt; One was blood in a flowing band.
&gt; One of air all whisper thin
&gt; And the ring of ice had a flaw within.
&gt; Full faintly shone the ring of flame
&gt; and the final ring was without name.

Now

1. The ring of iron is probably related to the fact that Kvothe has learned the name of the iron
For you was it only a bluff

2. The ring of stone probably has something to do with Fela
I stress the fact that, but the actual version makes Sim pretty silly, didn't it?

3. The ring of blood is quite interesting. I think that it would be great if Kvothe made a ring with HIS blood -perhaps the same drops that gave to Devi as warranty-.

4. ""The ring of ice has a flaw within"": has anybody ever thought to Denna's ring

5. ""And the final ring was without name."" Here no speculation is possible

6. ""There were rings unseen"" leads to the final question: where are all those rings now?

Here's my idea.

Aleph turned some of the Ruach into Angels of a sort and they can only punish what they themselves witness from that day forward. Selitos refuses saying

Tehlu

If he is reborn it would likely have some of the same circumstances as with Menda. A virgin birth. Accelerated learning and maturing. A mission to bring justice. Persuit of ""Demons""... Familiar enough? Kvothe's mother DOES make mention of being visited in the night by someone with red hair who isn't Kvothe's ""father""... Maybe that's a bit far off

Not only that

I also think Devi is a solid candidate for another of the Angels

Scarpi knows only one story that unfolds everywhere... Does he know everything that's ever happened? While being arrested he started to say ""Tehlu always said..."" Was he intending to tell something he heard Tehlu say personally? Scarpi is of the Amyr

The similarity of the story of Selitos to the story of Odin is enough for me to want to draw the connection, and who do we know that reaches out to affect the events of the future besides the Cthaeh? The Cthaeh is presented as a villain, but we know nothing about what would happen if it didn't do what it did, so maybe it is selecting the best posible path ""no matter the cost"" which would certainly fit with the motto of the Amyr. Scarpi, Selitos and the rest of the Amyr have potential allies in their fight in the Angels who are periodically reborn, but if they are born with blank slates they would have to be found and guided and taught and would probably be guided from afar so as to prevent the bad guys from finding them while they are young and vulnerable. And if Denna was found and guided by the wrong people? It also occurs to me as possible that the Sithe are actually the protectors of the Cthaeh, shooting down any threat to it as opposed to executing anyone that talks to it. Kvothe wouldn't have been much of a threat and might have preferred status as an Angel which allowed him to approach.

Also the fact that the Angels sang songs of power makes me want to believe they are the Singers that Haliax is protecting the Chandrian from. This makes sense to me. Is there some connection to the Edema Ruh as a whole? Calling them Singers would certainly distinguish them effectively from the Adem. What if Kvothe, maybe Kvothe is to do the same for the Chandrian with his music?

This also suggests to me that Kvothe who is ""beyond reproach"" according to Auri

Is Kvothe ACTUALLY Sir Savien??

Is Denna ACTUALLY Aloine?

That would be pretty badass...

I have more ideas about the creation of the world by Aleph and the nature of the Creation War and what Haliax is actually trying to do... I'll post them when I have more sorted out

1363380588.0,1ade9k,My theories (some spoilers...),QuantumQualia,28,8,39,"My theories:

1) Bast is Kvothe's son (by Felurian?). This is why Bast is so interested in Kvothe's wellbeing.

2) Kvothe returned to Fae already and spent a long period of time there (on the scale of a century) but didn't age and returned shortly after he had left

3) Ash is Cinder. This one's been talked about so much it's almost not worth putting here

4) Kvothe killed Sim

5) The Chandrian possess a victim and act through that person to kill others. I found this theory in Jo Walton's re-read and it almost gave me nightmares. Kvothe killed his troupe after being possess by the Chandrian and manufactured his physical encounter with the Chandrian in his mind. This also might have some bearing on why he killed Sim if

6) Kvothe has changed his name in order to hide from the Chandrian and prevent further attacks on people who grow close to him. The Chandrian have means of finding him based on his Name/identity

Issues under consideration:

1) I see a lot of talk about who the Penitent King is

There is something w don't know about Haliax - maybe a moral ambiguity about the Creation War that is as yet undiscovered. Is Selitos evil - are the Amyr evil? Maybe everyone is just flat out evil.

The ""king"" who is being referred to is actually the Maer Alveron. Now

Here is what is known:

-The Maer is the only king that Kvothe has had contact with

-Kvothe has several quarrels and disputes to settle with the Maer/Lackless. *that gives us (assuming some sort of escalation) motive*

Essentially all I am saying, and the motive (dispute with the Maer or his wife) 

Just some speculation.

Heres what I personally think


I think that some time will go by and the Maer or Lackless will somehow get the mystery box open, who I think has some vested interest in Kvothe (some are suggesting that he is a Amyr or Chandrain) 


Perhaps being further pushed by Bredon, and he stops at nothing in order to acquire this new piece of intel. 

If the Maer were to die as a result of all this, and that Meluan also died), a state of war would make a great deal of sense in the foreseeable future.

First off

So I was excited when book two came out. I even bought a copy at a book signing, I just want to make this preamble to explain how much of a fan I am personally of Pat. 

That said

Am I the only one who was immensely let down when the myths of the stories (within the world) started to become too... real? 

In Name of the Wind, and then, as the book unfolded, you realized they were wrong. Dead wrong. You learned how he got his names, and that was cool. The whole premise of ""interview the hero"" seemed based on the idea of ""dispel the sensationalism, and tell the true story.""

Now, say, A Song of Ice and Fire after all. I loved in Name of the Wind, when you first see the Chandrian, and they're scary as balls.

But WMF seemed too much. Right after coming down from the fight in the woods, it was mentioned a few times, y'know. But I was ready for the inversion. I expected Felurian to be more like a wilds witch or something.

I expected more of the plot to be aversions of fantasy tropes. I expected the mundane. The draccus was. Dragons: the most overtly fantastical element of the genre

Then

I guess in the end, and I have no idea how to feel about book three.

1) Kvothe has never won a game of Tak against Brendon (that I can recall).

2) Brendon states about playing Tak: “Any man that’s half awake can spot a trap that’s laid for him. But to stride in boldly with a plan to turn it on its ear, then beat them. That is twice marvelous.” (p. 446)

3) Kvothe swears to Denna: “I swear I won’t attempt to uncover your patron.  I swear it on my name and my power. I swear it by my good left hand. I swear it by the ever-moving moon.” (p. 490)

Interestingly

My hunch is Tak is a metaphor for Kvothe's battle against the Chandrian.  He will learn more.  He will get better at finding them and fighting them

&gt; What if someone told you they knew a type of magic that did more than that? A magic where you sort of wrote things down, if someone saw the writing, even if they couldn’t read it, it would be true for them. They’d think a certain thing, or act a certain way depending on what the writing said.”

In one of his first blog posts
&gt; It’s a story about stories. About how everyone tells stories

I've posted before about the possibility that the reason Skarpi knows Kvothe's name in Tarbean is not because he's been keeping an eye on him

There are numerous themes and ideas in the story that allude to each other - parallels between Taborlin, for example. But there are also very specific re-used elements. The ""how many spades are there"" question is a good one. One of my favorites: when Kote is testing out Chronicler's shorthand writing, he has him write ""I, by signing below, hereby attest to the fact that I can neither read nor write."" The book seller in Tarbean later writes this exact phrase on Kvothe's receipt for Rhetoric and Logic. 

But the most mind-blowing piece of evidence is one I didn't notice myself. I'll just let you read this one.

1341523091.0,w3gfs,Kote/Kvothe (we'll just go with K)- at the Inn,demooo,26,6,9,"I'm sure these things have been discussed

To begin


* At the beginning of NotW, K initially retaliates against the soldiers, only to be horribly defeated. How could K defeat 5 'mythical' creatures, then fails to 2 soldiers. As pointed out in a few other threads, K remarks that he 'almost forgot who he was for a minute'. Is this K having to retain the image of Kote? Had he defeated the 2 soldiers, he would have needed to actually kill them. Could K have been protecting his image as Kote to spare a few lives? (Yes, this would make the situation with Cobb and crew and the changeling difficult to explain.)

* Sympathy or magic. While failing to perform when the inn is attacked, I'm without my books). What does this mean? (Many people have made reference to Strawberry wine being what exploded, which is what Denna/K seem to drink in most of their intimate gatherings.)

* K's memory is still beyond amazing. He is able to recall conversations, as mentioned by Sim when finding Elodan's books. This part seems perfect. Yet Kote will act as though he has a faultier memory when he's surrounded by his regulars at the Inn.

So I'm not sure what to make of these. We could say the wine exploding was K's unconscious mind taking control (meaning K's conscious mind is what has lost the ability). Or we could say that it was a slip in K's act when K was confronted by Chronicler (foreshadowing D betraying him or something happening to her).

I've read through a few theories on this sub concerning Denna's patron. The prevailing idea seems to be that it's Cinder. I like the idea

Here is why:

- He is violent towards women. I can't remember the exact passage

- When Kvothe travels to Vintas, he runs into Denna. When he returns to the University, Denna somehow reappears in Imre. While we don't know for sure that Ambrose is back at the University, I suspect he might have returned after a one-year hiatus as well.

- The patron is very secretive. Ambrose makes it a point to never be directly connected to any of his shenanigans. 

- And finally, Ambrose.

Skarpi:

The last quote got me thinking the hardest. Mostly because it never actually states in the book that Kvothe ever introduced himself to Skarpi, in my opinion. Not to mention he has a far too chilling recollection of Lanre's downfall.

The paralells between jax and the moon and kvothe and denna are staggering. Firstly kvothe\Jax, both are after a love that  eludes them. Very impatient listeners, kvothe getting pissed with elodan, jax telling the hermit it took too long to learn listening and stomped off to find the moon. Both lost a musical instrument when younger and finally felurian told us jax was imprisoned after the moon incident, kvothe is kind of in a prison at present. Also it's looking like both might have started a war. The folding house\fae is the only place i get stuck on.

As for denna, it was via a musical instrument that they first noticed kvothe\jax(ok i know he knew denna a few days before that lute scene).

I'm sure there's others but the redbull is beginning to wear off. it kinda messes me up because there's a lot of paralells between kvothe and denna, something bad happened to them earlier in life(doesn't say directly with denna but its hinted at).

1334033331.0,s23af,I think I know what Chronicler's purpose is in this story,xebo,19,1,15,"I got some of this from the kingkiller ""Reread"". Spoilers abound

Let me lead up to this a bit with some fun facts:


1. Skarpi ""woke up"" Kvothe from his mind's ""sleep"" - While on the streets
2. Kvothe never told Skarpi his name, and his reasons for existing were renewed (Go to the university. Avenge his parents). 
3. Skarpi references the 7 - He sarcastically asks the inquisitor that tried to arrest him in the bar if he ""plans on hunting down Heliax and the 7 on his own"". 
4. Skarpi had ""friends in the church"" - When the inquisition tried to arrest Skarpi for Heracy


Now, I can move on to the Chronicler's purpose:

1. Skarpi is an Amyr - He has friends in the church
2. Skarpi is a ""Namer"" - He literally ""woke"" Kvothe up by calling Kvothe's name. He used ""naming"" magic on Kvothe to continue him down his path.

Alright

1. Chronicler and Skarpi are associates
2. Chronicler is an arcanist who knows at least 1 name already (Iron).
3. The way you ""name"" something or someone
4. Bast commanded chronicler to snap Kvothe out of his stuper at the Inn.

Ok

Skarpi awoken Kvothe the first time on the streets as a child because of some plan of the Amyr. Chronicler, and will awaken Kvothe a second time at the Inn!

How will he do this? By understanding Kvothe completely. How will he come to understand who Kvothe truly is

Are the Amyr really ""good""? Are the Chandrian really ""bad""? The beliefs of the Four Corners inhabitants are too black and white for my tastes at present

""This is my doom upon you. Your own name will be turned against you

This seems a very innocuous statement, Haliax initially and the others because they follow him. But where did the others come from, how did they get roped into this? Perhaps they followed Haliax with the intent of killing him for his crimes intially, but because they followed at all, they became Chandrian themselves, and are now cursed the same as Haliax, due to Selitos' curse. This carried on until they were seven and somebody figured out what was going on

Option 1: The Chandrian are in fact killing all these people that encounter them, I believe they're doing it to save these people from a worse fate, that of becoming cursed as they are. In this case, the Amyr are hunting them for killing innocents all the time and generally being cursed baddies, which is the apparent situation. 

Option 2: These groups are in fact being killed by the Amyr, to prevent the curse of the Chandrian from spreading further. This behavior is in line with their mantra, and the Amyr are in a much better position (or at least were, as they were formerly affiliated with a very powerful church) to purge the records of the world of all mention of themselves or the Chandrian than the Chandrian seem to be. I think this is a much more interesting scenario, but the question now becomes why do the Chandrian follow in the wake of the Amyr, especially since these people are being killed for talking about/accidentally finding information on the Chandrian.

Let's go chronologically. **This is your last chance to avoid spoilers. I'm going to talk about stuff that will spoil the books if you haven't read them**.

1) When Kvothe's troupe is killed by the Chandrian. During this scene, the Chandrian look towards the sky, ""like they can hear music"" or something. Then the Chandrian peace out really fast. AKA the Amyr were coming and the Chandrian had to beat it.

Now remember that the reason the Chandrian were attracted to the troupe was because Kvothe's parents were writing a song about them

**So we know that Kvothe's parents repeated the Chandrian's names to attract them

Next: Skarpi's story. There's the one about how Myr Tyraniel is destroyed. But the second one talks about how Selitos petitions to go after the ~~Amyr~~Chandrian (typos trolol). A few people join him, unless you're a badass namer or super powerful, *you can't see them*. This explains why the Chandrian looked like they were hearing music from far away. Only they could perceive them and Kvothe couldn't.

Edit: I realize that Aleph told them not to

**We've established the Amyr are angel-like

Fast forward to Book 2 when Kvothe and Tempi and whatnot are attacking the bandit camp. Kvothe goes deep into the heart of stone, and starts *praying*. He's praying to Tehlu, and some other people who's names were coincidentally mentioned in Skarpi's story. And not just praying. He's *repeating* their names over and over and over. 

**What do we know about repeating the name of a powerful being? It attracts said being**

The leader of the camp is strangely familiar to Kvothe, Kvothe goes for a last ditch effort. Pulls his remaining alar together, grounds the huge tree, and while he's grounding the tree *the leader of the camp tilts his head like he can hear music far away* and bounds back into the tents. Kvothe notes the familiarly graceful movements. Then kvothe passes out as there's a giant flash of light.

The next day everyone fills in Kvothe. It was strange. Not just one bolt of lightning hit the tree

So obviously, repeating their names over and over. Cinder realizes they're coming, runs for it. The Amyr show up and explode the tree as ""lightning"". It appears as lightning because people either 1) Would attribute lightning striking the tree rather than holy angels attacking a demon or 2) because they can't perceive the Amyr not being powerful enough. I'll point this out for you in case you missed it. 

**Kvothe was unconscious when the Amyr showed up. That's why he didn't see them.**

In light of this it stands out to me how frequently Kvothe metes out justice without thinking of it as such. He'll steal pens and ink from an asshole bookshop owner

(By the way: This also led me to the speculation that the reincarnated angels had, and I could not imagine what else would be enough to grant someone that distinction... Add to that the times Kvothe is mentioned as a Ciridae (by Auri) and the times he had some imagery around him that might imply that link (Perhaps the blood running down his hands as he cleared the bandit camp was close to the events that were the actual origin of the tattoos.) This would mean that the angels reborn had allied themselves with the Amir, those that had a similar calling but pursued it in a different way, which would make very much sense.)

I've speculated that Kvothe is the reborn Tehlu. I also believe that Taborlin, Menda and Illien are previous incarnations since each excelled so clearly in their own ways and gained notoriety the way the others did. (This might also mean Kvothe is the 7th incarnation of Tehlu, and the number 7 is mentioned as special more than once.) I believe Ben's comment that Kvothe would be the best at whatever he chose is important as well. Since Illien never fought the Chandrian as far as we're aware, perhaps that incarnation never witnessed their work and thus could not punish them. Taborlin, by extension, would then be an incarnation that DID witness the Chandrian's work (or maybe only Cyphus, or maybe Cyphus wronged him particularly

If all this is true

If I'm right, as Tehlu, is the greatest of them, but the others should have some measure of what makes him stand out. He learns quickly. He has affinities for certain things, especially music. He's driven. He's just. And if Denna is more than a coincidence, they might all gravitate to each other, making the whole cast of characters potential candidates.

I'd already thought that Devi was a solid candidate, honest, gentle Sim. He could never bring himself to say bad things about another person, just imply them. Even that was hard for him."" and it reminded me of the description of Enlas, ""who would not carry a sword or eat the flesh of animals, and who no man had ever known to speak hard words."" If this is a positive link, what other evidence is there? I went through the descriptions and mentions of the various characters and started trying to compile a list of who I think the angels are.

In the following list, the description from Scarpi's story, my guesses as to their current identity, What their special talent might be, and a work-in-progress of citations of passages that support my guesses.

Please give feedback. I'd love to know your guesses and reasoning and will update the list if I think your guess is better than mine. (Credited of course. :D)

&lt;-------------------------&gt;

(M)Tehlu - But Tehlu stood forward saying, his head bowed, his hands open at his sides.

Kvothe - (?)

(WMF:23)""You look like an Amyr

(WMF:24)""You are my Ciridae

(WMF:35)""They were all awful to look at. But he was the worst. I can't get faces right

(NOW:28)Then Aleph spoke their long names and they were wreathed in a white fire. The fire danced along their wings and they became swift. The fire flickered in their eyes and they saw into the deepest hearts of men. The fire filled their mouths and they sang songs of power. Then the fire settled on their foreheads like silver stars and they became at once righteous and wise and terrible to behold. Then the fire consumed them and they were gone forever from mortal sight.

(WMF:97)I felt as if this was the only time in my life I had been fully awake. Everything looked clear and sharp, some piece of me realized faintly. No longer sleeping, I thought and smiled(...)Now I knew her to the marrow of her bones. Her eyes were like four lines of music, clearly penned. My mind was filled with the sudden song of her. I drew a breath and sang it out in four hard notes(...)I cupped my hands and breathed a sigh into the hollow space within. I spoke a name. I moved my hands and wove my breath gossamer-thin. It billowed out, engulfing her, then burst into a silver flame that trapped her tight inside its changing name(...)I spoke again, and the wind brought her down among the pillows. I made a tearing motion and the silver flame that once had been my breath became three notes of broken song and went to play among the trees(...)I saw myself reflected in her eyes

Kirel - Tall Kirel

Devi - (Sympathy)

They feared a woman who could match a master by her second year."" Sweat made her pale hair cling to her forehead. She clenched her teeth

Enlas - Enlas

Simmon - (Alchemy)

(NoW:54)I liked Simmon

(NoW:56)Wilem put a protective arm around Simmon

(NoW:65)""I like them

[Side note: maybe the Jax realizes his Fae realm is missing awesome things {LIKE A MOON?!} and wants him/his folk to steal them from the other realm?]

- Lanre comes around, we got nothing."" (Lyra helps)

- War starts to end

- Lanre gets pissed (duh) and leaves his forces to get Lyra back, Lyra is dead, etc.)

- Lanre finds Jax

- Lanre kills Jax/Iax and in his last words Jax/Iax binds himself into Lanre. Or Lanre kills him in a way that sucks his powers and soul. This gives Lanre his skill at binding and naming. But still no Lyra.

- Lanre decides that the only way to get Lyra back is to destroy one realm/both of the realms. (THE CHANDRIAN'S PLAN?)

In his room

What has he locked in the box? His good left hand? His name and his power? A part of his name, it clearly represents his own identity, his heroism and his power, and he can't do what he once did. 

When he falls on the box, it broke my heart. Why did he lock himself away like that? Did he kill someone he loved like Auri, or does he believe that he will only do harm due to the Cthaeh's influence? He clearly thinks he is somehow responsible for the troubles in the world (""Kote,"" again) but is he right?

Also, one of the things that is Named by Namers in the story. Stone, the doors of which contain the Enemy. I am now certain that the Scrael are Shaped, and I think it's likely that the Shapers (the enemy?) are loose in the world again.

So we know that a king has been killed and that it has led to civil unrest and outright war in the frame story. We know that regardless of how things *actually* went down, or at least the head of one faction in the civil war, is known as the ""Penitent King"". Much of the speculation regarding this title focused on penitent in the more literal sense of who might have cause to feel remorse and why.

This reading, (and I swear this has come up in at least one previous re-read post, though it was entirely ignored in the speculative summary) because we've already met a group known as penitent. From the Midwinter Pageant episode during Kvothe's time in Tarbean: ""Many of [the grey-robed procession] wore the heavy iron chains of penitent priests"" (NotW Ch. 22).

Granted

With this association in mind, AND/OR what this hints at regarding a resurgence of the church (Amyr?) as a political power, since we are told most of the church's absolute power crumbled with the fall of the empire... 

Iron chains are reminiscent of Tehlu v. Encanis, but who are instead attempting to bring the world under heel, or burn it down trying, ""for the greater good""? Then again, according to Skarpi, Tehlu heads up the angels and not the Amyr, which begs the further question of how the human Amyr order became entangled with the Tehlin church to begin with. Then again AGAIN we've been shown there is nothing like a consensus regarding Tehlin doctrine even internally,,False,t3_1fduv4

Where is the Waystone Inn? It's never really addressed. We know it's in Newarre

The one hint I've managed to scrounge up is that it is somewhere far west on the map. This comes from the opening part of NoTW

The Commonwealth, how do we know that the inn is not in Ceald, that they're speaking the Cealdish language?

Also

""He called himself Kote. He had chosen the name carefully when he came to this place. He had taken a new name for most of the usual reasons and a few unusual ones as well

Usual reasons? He wanted to escape from something, which is where Kvothe presumably picked up Bast. Possibly, he is located where he is because he is closest to the Amyr? Or conversely, the last sight of the Seven? He is waiting to die, after all, what's the quickest way to go other than placing yourself in the maw of your opponent? Or maybe, he is distancing himself from all memory of his previous life? Looking on the map, the only place K will not have visited will have been Ceald. Technically

Another note on why I don't think they're in The Commonwealth, the Commonwealth doesn't have a king. Does that mean it is also possible that the inn is in the Small Kingdoms?

I think the Cthaeh is central to it all. We know lanry spoke to it ok it didn't say straight out it caused what lanry did but i imagined it influenced his decision.

The reason i bring up the Cthaeh, or was there a little help from the Cthaeh. I'm convinced denna has visited it, i thinks she's been to the Fae, i'm not sure is she one though. Kvothe said she has the look of the fae, Deoch commented that she seemed older than her years(kvothe spent almost a year in the fae but only 2-3 days passed in his world). When he left her in NOTW to battle the drakus, he left her at a waystone and was not there when he got back.

Somehow she's learned her destiny and that it's tied to kvothe. I think she's trying to save him or stop him(betray him). Practically the first thing she does is try to get him to not go to the university(his destiny). It could explain why she cried when he played the lute the first time, although what does bug me is when she seems to get jealous, like the end of AWMF. I've got another idea floating around my head about her protecting kvothe from the patron.

I think Kvothe and her are different sides of the same coin

1341213211.0,vwybw,Two Questions (spoilers throughout thread),navahgar,17,3,17,"I apologize if these two questions/thoughts have been raised before.  If so

First, and the relationship between them.  There is a strong suggestion (sometimes explicit) that Bast views Kote as a teacher.  I don't have tNotW in front of me, but I think at one point Kote introduces Bast as his student.  But what could Kote be teaching Bast?  Bast is a Faerie, 150+ years old, and clearly possesses magical powers.  Bast obviously idolizes Kote, or at least Kvothe, but that doesn't explain why Kote would take on Bast as an apprentice.

Moving past the initial reasoning behind the arrangement, however, I recall numerous times in that book (and I think once in tWMF) when Kote asks Bast to read *Celum Tinture*.  What is that book?  In tWMF chapter 143 we learn that it is a book about alchemy.  Isn't it curious that Kote's only overt attempts at 'teaching' Bast are centered around a subject that he continually claims to be very poor at?  Could it be that the copy of *Celum Tinture* that Kote is trying to get Bast to read actually has some other information in it?  Information that Kote cannot access/remember in his current state.  Or maybe it uses some of that magic Denna alludes to that is based on written things creating truth?  I don't know, but I suspect that that copy of *Celum Tinture* will become relevant.

Second, and Maer Alveron.  During Kvothe's interaction with the Cthaeh, it says:

&gt;Not many folk will take your search for the Amyr seriously

&gt;Blood, I wish you creatures had the wit to appreciate me.  Whatever else you might forget, remember what I just said.  Eventually you'll get the joke.  I guarantee.  You'll laugh when the time comes.

I've read a number of theories that focus on the word 'stick', the Fae, the Moon's name, whatever).  I've read none that point out the following: Amyr and Maer are very similar sounding words.  I'm not sure what the implications of this are.  Maybe the Maer will become Amyr.  Maybe the Amyr are using the Maer.  Maybe the name 'Alveron' is similar to the name of an Amyr.  I don't know.

The mere fact that Kote can't open it says a lot to me. But, but can't. Judging from Chapter 151 in WMF, I believe it's safe to assume that Kote knows (or thinks he knows) how to open the chest. He knows where the two physical keys are and how to place them. The last lock is the one that won't budge. So, either he's lost the last key (being something along the lines of sympathy and naming) or he thought ahead and constructed it so that even he himself wouldn't be able to open it. There are other options, which I've entertained-someone switched it with a fake chest, it's actually just for show-but those seem pretty useless.

In any case

1. It's his name
2. He keeps his other name in the box -- ""Kvothe"". Can you dissect a name? Maybe he hid part of it or maybe he hid it all and simply adopted a new one (""Kote"" meaning 'disaster' in Siaru) to reflect his past actions?
3. His sleeping mind. Dunno if it's possible to lock the chest without naming, possessed.

So Marten is praying heavily and with full belief and emotion in each word. He pulls the attention of the Leader with those words that you would assume - even with us knowing he is Cinder - the Leader shouldn't be able to hear over the storm from that distance.

The Leader then looks up at the sky and disappears into his tent - this seems very much like when the Chandrian killed  Kvothes family and were taunting him when suddenly Haliax looks up gathers his group around him and they all disappear together.

* The girl gives off a very Denna like feel to me. If it is Denna, it covers ""a vast scope of time"".

* If Denna isn't a Chandrian/Amyr

* Going off of how vast the time is

* The beasts that come make me think of the terrible things that could be done by naming instead of knowing. Change the name

* The smoke in the distance made me think of Myr Tariniel when it was finally betrayed.

* Could the shadow bent to look like a man be a skin walker? Doubtful

* Is this just a folk story of how fae and other creatures came to be weakened by Holly? Old Holly destroyed their ancestors and the weakness was passed down somehow?

* Finally, spiked leaves), but who knows.

One question regarding the Amyr that is, what is to prevent an Amyr who has become corrupted from running amok committing atrocities?

Rothfuss mentions in a recent video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=ptmXe023sJM#t=1822s) that this is an important question in Book 3 and the answer gets to the true root of the origin of the Amyr.

This brought to mind a theory that perhaps Lanre is the first of the Amyr. His burning of Myr Tariniel, which seems like the unwavering judgement of the Amyr taken to an extreme level. Of course this would mean that Skarpi's second story (regarding the origin of the Amyr) was false, but even Skarpi notes that not all stories are 100% truth.

-K's thrice locked chest made of iron

-Chronicler binds Bast with the NAME of Iron

-Let’s not forget the obvious Fae don't like iron one. I think WHY is the big question with this one for me… similar to copper's effect on namers

-The Cthaeh smells iron on K and deduces that he is Felurian's new manling and wonders how Felurian can stand it

-K holds an iron drab up to the scraeling and it cracks while making a hissing sound.

-K uses an iron pipe to fight the scraeling

-K makes up a story about Chronicler saying ""And more important

-A black iron box to hold part of the moon's name

-Kvothe the Bloodless wears a ring of iron on his first hand; I presume the right because the other rings are amber, which correspond to rings given to him in Vintas. BUT of course, K did sell his rings before leaving Vint, so who knows. And the left hand of course is where rings are worn if you have mastery over that thing. On his second hand ""One was blood in a flowing band. One of air all whisper thin, And the ring of ice had a flaw within. Full faintly shone the ring of flame, And the final ring was without name.""

-The Adem have iron stoves &gt; most likely irrelevant but still in the text

-Trivial again, then looked away from Lanre's expression suddenly hopeful. ""For an hour, or a day. But you would return, pulled like iron to a loden-stone.

-Draccus scales have iron in them

-K and Bast shortly discuss how iron would not have an effect on a shapechanger. I don't remember much about this sequence

-Graham the cooper shows up with three new barrels bound with brass instead of iron for K. It is speculated that this is done with Bast in mind.

Ok now on to the meat!
We will wrap this post up by talking about the Chandrian and how iron relates to them. I propose that it could very likely be that some of

Stercus is in thrall of iron. (a slave to iron)
I think this could be a pretty clear indicator that little Stercus here is a Faen creature. That or it is simply his sign and nothing else.

Ferule chill and dark of eye.
Is it odd that Ferule (Cinder) is the only Chandrian with two symbols mentioned? (CHILL and DARK OF EYE) Is he special? Is he second in command within the Chandrian (doubtful)? Does this mean he is cold? Pale skin? Cold hearted? Dark of eye makes me think that his eyes are just large pupils
And let’s not forget the chemical element iron is repressed by the symbol ""Fe"" &gt; FErule. *Cringes* that’s a stretch... But is it really? Names are very important right? I've read that a ferule is a type of cane or stick

Usnea lives in nothing but decay. (rust?)
Is this the Chandrian that causes rusting, Ferule - dark eye, Grey Dalcenti - never speaks (*Cough* K kills Denna's patron, a Chandrian, and become a Chandrian himself and thus locks his name in a thrice locked chest to avert certain disaster and inherits his silence *cough*) Now there's a new post for someone...

Alright, and he's just not quite the same of a fighter (to put it lightly). He doesn't have Denna, and the world's gone crazy (presumably because of the Fae). But he does have Bast, a strange Fae child who really wants him to be back to his old self, and seems to care a lot for Kvothe.
In addition (and more importantly) we know that Denna made Kvothe swear on his name and his good (right

And then he went to the Fae and slept with Felurian (a lot).

The way I see it going down, because he's promised Felurian he would go back but he's definitely in love with Denna.
I think they get there, Felurian, being as emotional and protective as she is, sees Denna as a threat, and perhaps even moreso now that she has a son with this man. But Denna, simultaneously, sees Kvothe as having broken his word.
Felurian attacks Denna, and he loses his true name and his good hand (meaning he can no longer play or properly perform any of his abilities). So he loses both the women, and is stuck with a Fae child that he doesn't know what to do with.

Some sound editing to make it go more smoothly and a free amount of video edits so the podcast will have fun features (like a sometimes rotating background to make notice of the subject or theory we are taking apart or creating). We did have a few ideas about subjects and other fan interaction, but more on that after the 28.

Now onto the name...

* What if somehow Kvothe awakens mid story? There are bunch of theories of how he awakens floating around; from Bast opening the chest, or he doesn't want o finish the story any more and has to be convinced otherwise. Heck, he could even bring Bast and Lochees with him and attempt to finish the story while travelling. 

* More demons attack. We've seen attacks by Scrael and a possessed Mercenary, something like this could heavily change the course of the book. Hell, this could even be the moment Kvothe awakens.

I have a new topic about Master Ash for you all.  

Why does Denna stay with him, despite offers of safety, or learning, or money.    

I saw the Drugs and women post

My new theory to present today is that she has become or is starting to become a denner addict.  Her only real source of it is Master Ash, why would she let him do such?  She runs from any man who tries to get grabby, she keeps Kvothe at a harsh distance at the end of WMF.  So I think it's possible that perhaps she has the addict's issue, and allows all of that, because she is chemically stuck to M. Ash due to Denner resin.

1333420253.0,rqkcg,Admitted Inconsistencies – Caesura (spoilers WMF),rainbowtunnel,13,1,17,"Edit: I'm trying to make this post more manageable (prettier) to read

**Tl;dr: We’ve seen three notable swords in the KKC so far: Folly, but which one? Why is it renamed? Was the name inspired by Ben’s note in Rhetoric and Logic? Does this mean it’s directly related to why Kvothe is in hiding?**  

Read more for quoted descriptions of each sword and more analysis


We see a few notable swords in tNotW. In the beginning, Kvothe obtains Caesura.  

**1)** Folly:  

*“It shone a dull grey-white in the room’s autumn light. It had the appearance of a new sword. It was not notched or rusted. There were no bright scratches skittering along its dull grey side. But though it was
unmarred, and when the crucible had cooled this was lying in the bottom: a sword in its pure form. It was slender and graceful. It was deadly as a sharp stone beneath swift water…. Its grey-white metal shone against the dark roah behind it.”*  
	
**2)** Cinder’s sword:  

*“His sword was pale and elegant. When it moved

**3)** Caesura:  

*“Then,   gripped it, and seemed to age ten years… The guard of this one extended out slightly, curving to give a hint of   protection to the hand. It was nothing like a full hand guard. Anything that bulky would render half the Ketan   useless. But it looked as if it would give my fingers an extra bit of shelter, and that was appealing to me.”*  

**4)** At one of their interludes from Kvothe’s  story in WMF, is Caesura. However, he points out it doesn’t match up with Kvothe’s description. And I quote:  

*“I can’t help notice that your description of Caesura doesn’t…” Chronicler hesitated. “Well

*“You’re absolutely right.” [Kvothe] turned to look at the sword. “This isn’t… what did the boy call it this morning?” His eyes went distant for a moment

*“I was just curious

*“Am I supposed to be offended that you’re paying attention?” Kvothe laughed again. “What fun is there in telling a story if nobody’s listening?”*  

**5)** Kvothe readily agrees that Folly, he was under contract to give the sword back when he died. At the present moment of the book, Kvothe has faked his death. He is, in effect, dead. In that case, Caesura should be back in Ademre. So then which sword is it? Did he make a duplicate Caesura, fashion the original hilt to the copy (to make it seem more authentic) and give the doppelganger back to Ademre to keep the true sword? Could it be he did return Caesura, so although the description matches more closely with Caesura

*“Defend yourself well at the University. Make me proud. Remember your father’s song. Be wary of folly.”*  

**6)** Ben was helping Arliden with the song about the Candrian. Could there be double meaning here? It seems odd Ben would warn against a sword, decided it was due to this “folly” he failed to be wary of, and is somehow connected to the sword. Perhaps he accidentally kills someone with it that he shouldn’t have? Did something with the sword that directly relates to his current state of hiding? (I don’t want to say “he kills Denna” because it’s so over stated, but…. Yeah, that’s an option, too.)

It already seems to be established that many people here believe that Bredon is one of the prime candidates to be Mr. Ash.  I myself fall into this camp.  He uses a cane (which the Cthaeh claims Denna is beaten with), the question I am asking is, what exactly is he playing at?

We first become suspicious of Mr. Ash when we realize that he summons Denna to witness the Chandrian attack on the wedding north of the University.  Next

Personally, but I think it raises some very interesting questions.  

1)  Why would anybody want to aid a group of mythological murderers who seem to be hellbent on killing anybody who has any sort of real knowledge about them?  Pat doesn't seem like the kind of author to just write a character as being evil for the sake of being evil

2)  What makes Bredon so special that the Chandrian wouldn't kill him, why is he spared an allowed to help them when everybody else was simply killed off?

3) What role is Bredon preparing Denna to play in all of this?  Obviously, or is there something deeper to her that we do not know about?  Are the Chandrian using both Bredon and Denna to keep tabs on Kvothe, the one who got away?  Why not just kill him outright if that is the case?

Shapers went beyond that, they created a similarly mirrored but different version of the four corners, called the Fae realm.  I believe that Kelvin's oddities are remanents of that time.  Such various things as the ever burning lamp and warding stones, and blades such as Saicere, that's survived thousands of years even with constant use.  I believe the Shapers now reside in the world now known as the Faen Realm, and Namers in the ""real"" world.

Felurian goes on to describe that there had been friction between the two factions, and it sparked a war between the old Knowers and the newer Shapers.  I believe this was the beginning of the Creation War.

Skarpi describes the Creation war as lasting longer then even the life spans of the people of that time who lived and died in it could remember.  In Felurian's description of the time before the splitting of the worlds

Waystones pop up speratically through-out the books, to wreck the havok, destruction and despair as described by Trapis in the story of Lanre.
  
In NotW, the doors of stone is mentioned again, when Felurian says the stealer of the moon is locked beyond them.

There's much speculation on what the stone doors under the Arcanum lead too, a ""well watered wine.""  I believe the stone doors Trapis and Felurian described are one in the same as the stone doors below the archives, and the Arcanum was built atop it to protect it and keep it unknown from the rest of the world.  And with Kvothe's obvious curiosity and uncanny ability at getting into things he shouldn't, I think he opens it.

I haven't really read this subreddit much before (although after reading the front page I'm subscribed now)


Kovthe is Meluan Lackless' nephew. His mother used to be a noble before becoming a troupe

When Kvothe sings the children's rhyme he picked up in a town they passed through about the seven things in Lady Lackless' dress his mother overhears and becomes upset. He likens it to a play and his mother says there is a difference between a character in a play and a real person. To remember that Lady Lackless is a person with feelings that can be hurt. She has him go fetch some thing to make it up to both her and Lady Lackless. 

Also along the same vein is his first meeting with Meluan. He says that she looks very familiar

And of course


Now on to Cinder:

I have a feeling this has also been discussed, kill him, and take his sword. Possibly at the fountain in Imre where the sandy-haired traveler says the stones were shattered and couldn't be mended.

1337478659.0,tvgj8,Some theories after rereading NotW (Spoilers inside),Karagee,8,1,8,"So i had two main things i hadn't heard pointed out before, wanted to get your takes on them

1) The children's song about the chandrian obviously has a variety of verses, and i think more common version ends with ""See a man without a face, move like ghosts from place to place, what's their plan, what's their plan, Chandrian Chandrian"", this fairly obviously refers to haliax/Lanre

However, he and denna have a moment of realization and say the rhyme.  In this version the ending is ""See a woman pale as snow? silent come and silent go.  What's their plan what's their plan, chandrian, chandrian"".  Is it possible this could refer to lyra?  Lyra is never physically described, at least to my knowledge.  Is it possible lyra is still ""alive"", but lost because of her and lanre's love? Similiar to the way she was able to bring lanre back to life after the giant battle.  Could the Chandrian really be searching for lyra?  If this is the case, would lyra maybe go wherever she hears clues of the chandrian, prompting them to destroy everything?"")


Theory #2

After they find the draccus, and that denna continues to show up and the damndest places where kvothe is, and this trend continues into WMF do you think it could be possible that cinder or perhaps the chandrian as a whole remember kvothe and want to keep an eye on him?  Perhaps they know he has been looking into them but haliax does not deem it worthy to kill him so cinder is trying to keep an eye on him?  Could it be cinder working on his own, as cinder and kvothe have a history from when kvothe's parents were killed? "")

No

Kvothe says he has an Alar ""like a blade of Ramston steel."" Ramston Steel is known to be brittle

So, and he as out of ideas and out of time. So he did the only thing he could. He shattered his Alar, breaking his mind in to two separate pieces, like he did when practising the Heart of Stone, but much more severe. He takes the Kvothe part, and seals it in the chest, and with it his magic and music, or perhaps the two he held dearest

Of course, he can't open it. He can do some Sympathy, but only by accident, when his sleeping mind calls on it, much like Kvothe could call Names with his sleeping mind.

Here is my small contribution to the theories surrounding the books and please bear with me if these are common well hashed out ideas.

Does Bredon from Vintas not seem like a very credible character as a secret member of the Amyr organization? He is a noble who stands apart from the others. He is rumored to have strange ritual ceremonies on his land. Also the tree mentions that Kvothe should stay close to the King to find the Amyr (I think it was the tree that said that...).

I also have a strong believe that Kvothe actually changed his Name to Kote and not just his regular name. That is based on him talking to Elodin about Denna and asking what he thinks of a girl who often is changing her name. Elodin grabs him and says he must never do that near the end of WMF.

Now while being somewhat known figures who likely make enemies out of students regularly could make them targets, even of say Devi's caliber, would be capable of causing serious injury to any of them in the relatively brief window between them realizing they're being targetted and getting to a gram.

This leads me to think that Branduer is talking about more than just carrying a gram when he mentions ""precautions"".  What he's referring to

The other thing that caught me but probably isn't as significant is the parallel of the Old Madman who teaches the Young Hero to slay evil (or something along those lines).  Not the one where Elodin is the Madman, his tools if you will.

So lots of people here think that Kvothe changed his name to Kote and hence changed himself and lost all his amazing skills that we've been hearing about. I definitely buy into this theory

Let's say Kvothe was a good student at the university, but what really stands out is his storytelling, his people are known for it. Maybe he uses this to his advantage, starts some rumours about himself, gains some notoriety, maybe the stories get out of hand, he's forced to leave university and retires to his inn under the guise of Kote... Then the world goes to shit, and realises that the world needs a batman

He did learn about a little known magic where you can make things that you write down become true though. So when the chronicler appears he takes his chance and tells him this fantastic story about Kvothe, get the girl, all the things Kote just capable of. So maybe after the story, when he changes his name back to Kvothe, he also gains the talent and skill he's been able to associate with the name.

Nothing is really resolved other than Kvothe getting filthy rich. 

-I felt like the entire time reading it I was waiting for the main plot line to reveal itself. As i write this its occurring to me that i could possibly be reading this trilogy in the wrong perspective however. I finished these past two books with the sense that i was waiting for the Chandrian and Amyr to make a larger appearance then a few snippets of Kvothe seeing a chandrian as the bandit leader

To me this seems like the plot that i was waiting to read about the entire time and yet it never surfaced. Perhaps though

Maybe this isnt about the Chandrian in singular plot course

In this perspective i can see how it could end the way it did and have it be an accomplished work. But looking at it for the sole purpose of say vengeance for his family

Further evidence of this is when he stopped Kvothe from learning about them in his first trip to the archives. Why would a Master go out of his way to help a lowly new E'lir to ""not embarrass himself?"" That's crap. Ulterior motives lay beneath his actions. Also the armed Caeldish dude who comes out of the meeting with Lorren. I think he's seeking books for Lorren like they say, and that's why he's allowed to live there. Are the candles there for warning of the Chandrian? They turn blue, he calls for help? I think he may know the name of fire too, which is another reason Lorren trusts him.

Speaking of the Chandrian influencing Kvothe, interesting) with kvothe might be a way of getting to know how Kvothe operates and just learn about him in general.  He disappears at the same time as Denna while in Severen, Bredon and Ash both have canes... etc etc. The list goes on. Also, Ash is teaching Denna *the wrong song.* It seems to be clear that he is doing this on purpose to confuse people about their true motives and how they came to be, trying to hide their story, which is pretty much all they do, right? That's why they killed the troupe

Speaking of their true story, which leads me to believe Kvothe is or will be a ""singer"" (""who keeps you safe fron the Amyr, the **singers**, the Sithe"") and they have deep power over controlling names) Felurians name and completely traps her and has total power over her, it says how he thinks about how she craves attention, why she kills men, she doesn't intend to she just needs attention so badly that she won't let them leave and loves them so hard they die. RIGHT after that he sings her name. If Skarpi's story is to be believed then Kvothe already knows why Lanre wants the world dead (to stop people from feeling pain or sorrow) and how he came to this reasoning (the death of Lyra and changing his name to Haliax, since Shehyn got Cinder's real name right or one letter off (Ferule/Ferula) when she listed their names


One thing I am really confused about is the knowledge that Denna seeks. She turns down having MAER FUCKING ALVERON as a patron, like Kvothe's? Does she think the Amyr killed them and is seeking revenge on them? I'd say the Chandrian but she was very disinterested in them when they were talking about them exploring the Mauthen farm.

I have thought long and hard about this. ""singers"" is not capitalized as ""the Sithe"" and ""the Amyr"" are. They are specific groups of people. The ""singers"" don't appear to be. This leads me to believe a certain theory.

Kvothe not only has a clear knack for naming (practically named Cinder when guessing Master Ash's name before deciding to just call him Master Ash, have an affect on the Chandrian? Can someone sing names in some order or context that makes naming them more powerful/hazardous?

Rothfuss has said on several occasions that he'd like to develop a Kingkiller pen-and-paper rpg. Excellent: if he can codify the rules

So

[Here](http://kkc.wikia.com/wiki/Sympathy) is a nice summary on the magic system.

* The Doctrine of Corrrespondence: Similarity enhances sympathy

* The Principle of Consanguinity: A piece of a thing can represent the whole of a thing

* The Law of Conservation: Energy cannot be destroyed nor created

Right, orientation, force, and heat. 

So, and the heat will flow as through conduction. However, you can also use sympathy to pump heat against the thermal gradient: for instance, you can use your body heat (37C) to light a cigarette (600C). It's unclear if sympathy can be used to transfer other types of energy directly. Perhaps the entire principle relies on energy transfer, and it just *looks like* two iron jots are locked in relative space.

There are more question marks: you can create a binding without touching something

A few books that i've read recently:

* **The Warded man/Painted man** - It came strongly recommended. I love the magic system and the story but the characters were poorly developed and the writing wasn't great either.

* **The Mistborn series** : Another great fantasy series with a great magic system. I loved it.
* **Song of Ice and Fire** - Where can i get more of this?
* **The kingkiller chronicles** - Probably my favorite fantasy book of all time. I love Rothfuss writing but the only thing i hate about him is
* **Gentleman Bastard series** - I heard it was similar to kingkiller chronicles and gave it a try. Stuck in the first book.
* **Jumper** - Totally different from the movie. Loved it.

Theory: I think that Auri is the moon

On pg. 108 English edition

""They knew each other. Of course.""
""I expect Kvothe is a nicer person than I am."" 
""That goes without saying.""

She's still pissed

On pg 109

""You've had better luck than I have . . . it's been years. This is the first time she's come within ten paces of me. We barely speak a dozen words on a good day."" 

If you've ever been in a divorce or royally pissed off a significant other

""I swear on my mother's milk . . . I swear on my name and my power. I swear it by the ever-moving moon."" 

A coincidence that he would mention the moon? It seems that Auri is certainly mentally damaged

Also, he says:

""Well thank God I'm the only one here that's ever made a bad decision in my life . . . I've heard stories about you too

I had initially thought of the ""boy"" in the story as a child, perhaps he is much older than he seems? There is also a very strong connection between Elodin and Taborlin the Great. I'm not sure how close of a connection, but certainly something nonetheless.

Moving on,"" which is what Kvothe thought it meant in Siaru. One could speculate and deduct, given that it isn't ""sunlight,"" that it could be something along the lines of ""sliver of light"" or ""light of the moon"" or something similar--certainly something having to do with light, but not direct sunlight. This could suggest that Auri is simply a piece of the light or a piece of the light of the moon, suggesting that part of her is locked away.

Kvothe has a talent for naming, he mistakes the language and comes ironically close to the mark. This seems to be yet again the case in TWMF with Auri.

Ok. Enough of that. Thoughts?

As we all know Denna is kind of mysterious and personally I believe her to be directly involved with the Chandrian. I don't know how Kvothe ties in with her dealings with the Chandrian but I believe she likes Kvothe and has had some bad things happen to her and she accidentally becomes involved with the C shortly after meeting Kvothe. Additionally she could have been involved with them much earlier. 


One of the main reasons I believe this is the seven word sentences her and Kvothe tend to exchange with each other when they're together

Now the following exchange struck me as having a double meaning coming from Denna's perspective. It's when they get to the farm outside of Trebon looking for Master Ash and Denna's things. 


Denna - ""I had some clothes and a lyre Master Ash bought for me.""

Kvothe - ""You play lyre? How many strings?""

Denna - ""Seven. I'm just learning. I was learning. I'm good enough for a country wedding and that's about it.""


Obviously the instrument with seven strings stands out as a connection along with the fact that Master Ash picked it out for her. Also lyre=liar as the double meaning in this exchange. This may be the first time she's directly lied to Kvothe as opposed to changing the subject or deflecting with her charm which Kvothe would be a fool for anyway. Along with that if she isn't practiced in lying then something simple would be the best for her to start with thus ""just good enough for a country wedding."" 


None of this is to say that this isn't just a harmless exchange between them but if she's directly involved with the Chandrian and this is the first time lying to Kvothe directly it almost feels as if she's trying to leave small clues for him in her words to try and get him to see what kind of trouble she's in. The romantic in me sees it that way but at the same time I feel like she will be the one to betray him before it's all said and done. Thanks for reading.

Taborlin the Great and Kvothe are the same person.

He may have already traveled back in time

If we accept that he had already made one time jump

His solution is to go as far forward into the future as he is able

Anyway, not just one. We know for example that Fela managed to learn the name of stone relatively quickly, and we've heard from Elodin that once you've learned one name, the others come easier. So we can suspect that in the entire world there are at least a bunch of people who know at least a hand full of names. Then I thought that maybe the two events - Elodin becoming crazy and him becoming the Master Namer - were somehow connected. I came up with this: Elodin became Master Namer, because he learned his own name. We've heard in the book that to know the true name of something means to understand it completely to the core. Now think about it: if you understood 100% what kind of human you are, all the good and all the bad parts (that many refuse to see), wouldn't you go crazy too?

What makes me wonder is that these are people that have been alive since The Creation War(or even before?) granted not in their current forms but that's beside the point. What makes me wonder about Kvothe's whole situation with pursuing the Chandrian is that they always kill anyone who even sings about their real names let alone someone who walks in on them post massacre. So with this in mind you'd think after they were forced to leave due to whatever force was coming upon them, given the fact that they would have agents in places of power i.e the University. So either they're really inept at taking care of their interests or they are aware of Kvothe and are perhaps maneuvering him into taking certain actions so as to be a powerful tool in their hand. This I think, what with Lanre originally being a champion of the Creation wars turning into a creature that now stands against everything he once fought for. A fitting end in the Cthaeh's eyes.

The vase/relic found in Trebon? I know the girl came back and told Kvothe more about it at the University.

Kvothes Bloodlines run back to ""The Singers"" as well as ""The Lackless"" Lackless possibly having Naming powers because they are one of the oldest families known.

Kvothe is given a key from Auri? Where does this fit into?

What does Lorren hide behind the vault in the library?

What of Kvothes name ""Maedre"" .....Fire...lightning...broken tree? Cthaeh maybe?

Bast is a prince...kingkiller? Interesting. There are different kings for different countries...as well as worlds?

Princesses plural from Sleeping barrow kings? Maybe Denna and Auri are both princesses or even related?

Hemme and Jakis will plot the downfall of Kvothe at the university in the next book?

1374651328.0,1ixzb1,I suspect deep sadness in the author...(spoilers),McDoogleSnatch,2,2,0,"I've recently finished book 2 of the series and a pattern I acknowledged in the first book is playing to even bigger extremes in the second.  This is the author's first publications and one is always advised to write about which one knows.  Thus

This is a little tricky to explain

I am an adult male who struggled to get into my first relationship until late in my 20's.  Watching all of my friends get in and out of relationships with relative ease, divorces, and children, all seemed like a foreign and fantastical thing to me.  I tried to assimilate into this world, but never had any success.  Despite being a social person who's good in groups, who doesn't have any physical abnormalities or personality disorders, I, somehow never *learned* how humans navigate through the process of attraction.  When one complains about not getting laid for four weeks

I consider Kvothe to be, the character is wrapped in mysticism and a Dickensian upbringing that may play more to fiction that factual parallel.  But where the parallels I believe come to fruition are in the character's relationships with other women.

Consider Denna.  When first described by Kvothe, Denna rejects Kvothe in a relationship sense because she is, in less kindlier words, a gold-digger; a prostitute.  Denna sees class and while she may think fondly of Kvothe, she would rather suffer the indignation, humiliation and abuse that comes with suitors, than debase herself with his lowly ranks.  I see this as a parallel of the young male in school who develops a crush on a prettier girl, but she confides in him as a friend; discussing about how her boyfriends treat her poorly and so on.  A man feels tempted to argue that he wouldn't act in such a fiendish manner

Now, before going there, I want to address some of the other female characters.

Fela.  She's a beautiful student at the university.  Kvothe does not become friends with her because of normal social interactions.  Instead, to want to win a girl's heart and affection with heroics.  Wouldn't it be so easy if the girl you had a crush on could be won over without the knowledge of social interactions but instead, by simply having done something of a heroic quality.  Indeed, for those who lack that something it takes to interact affectionately and attractively, one often thinks about how one can get noticed in extreme ways.  Heroic deeds certainly fulfill this fantastical qualification.  Notice she isn't attracted to him because of the way he gently touches her arm, or his 44-inch chest or how he compliments the efforts she puts into dressing up.  The writer seems to not know how affections and attraction interact among the sexes.  Also, the writer is indulging in another fantasy with Fela; having a beautiful girl attracted to you while you are indifferent to her.  Not only is the relationship parallel a child's fantastical ideals of attraction

Look at Auri.  She's a damaged young girl, while it could be viewed more as a sibling-like relationship, I suspect something else at hand.  Kvothe's relationship with Auri mirrors the selflessness a man wants to convey to the world, without bragging about it.  Meaning, a man will often do *nice* things for a woman seemingly just to be nice.  However, when a man seeks a relationship, every nice deed, comes with the silent, but Rothfuss, the author is making a juvenile plea on his own behalf

What about Devi?  Devi is, a fierce negotiator and domineering.  The author can't help but have some ""chemistry"" between them, evidenced in barbed banter.  Why is it that every girl of beauty and bronze is attracted to Kvothe? (this is a rhetorical question)

I said I'd get back to Denna...

The relationship with Denna, he's a lowly passenger aboard a carriage to the university.  When they meet up again, she's discovers his impressive musical qualities in Imre, but she is already bouncing from one male patron to another who have far more class and standing that he has.  Kvothe is on a journey, asking himself, how can he win Denna's affection?  Rothfuss, through Kvothe, how would he attract his Denna.  The solution for this seems to be rooted in the character of Felurian.

Felurian is a wildly fantastical character to whom Kvothe loses his virginity.  She is a mythically beautiful succubus, but he does so by someone who teaches him the ins and outs of physical allure and affection.  She is the most perfect and idealized creature to do so.  After leaving Felurian, Kvothe is blessed with the one thing that he couldn't earn otherwise; confidence.

Confidence, only that they have the *feeling* that someone possesses it.  For a person who fails to have a relationship in their teens or twenties, confidence is an evasive trait.  It's one that endures an insufferable negative feedback loop, as the lack of confidence, mixed with poor results upon taking action, only leads to less confidence.  How different would things have been for me, and all of the other countless males who never broke through the understanding of seduction, to possess the swagger and aura of confidence too often sought but so rarely defined?  I imagine Rothfuss wished it.  And I imagine he gave Felurian to Kvothe not only to satisfy an if-only for his life

To further prove his boost in sexual confidence indeed works, a sex life is indicative of adulthood while the lack thereof is reserved for children.  I sense in Rothfuss that he knew of no better way, or perhaps even no other way, of maturing Kvothe.

In my estimation, a wishing for how things could have (should have?) been.  As such, I see these two novels thus far as a therapeutic outcry, for a grown man who has no other outlet from which to vent.  This is why I sense such a sadness... ",,False,self,False,t3_1ixzb1

1363448632.0,1aeuyj,A theory I just thought of (NotW and WMF spoilers) about true names.,bunnyflop,1,2,6,I suddenly recalled a conversation between Kvothe and Elodin in WMF. In the conversation Kvothe asks Elodin what he would think of a person who continuously changes their name. I do not have the book with me so I do not have the quote but I remember Elodin thinking that Kvothe is talking about ones true name and he acts disgusted and wonders why anyone would be dumb enough to do that. This implies that changing one's true name is possible!! My theory is that Kvothe the innkeeper had foolishly changed his true name at some point between the end of the story in WMF and the present time in the book. This had a huge effect on him and led to his certain inabilities to use sympathy and fight well as an innkeeper. Any thoughts?,t5_2smxb,True
