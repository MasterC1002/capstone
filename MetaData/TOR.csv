Below is the basic mockup I put together

I have been looking for a really secure email service for a long time now and while Tormail is great

---

**XINJA MAIL**

(REALLY OLD AND BAD MOCKUP) http://imgur.com/3m7ObEI

Here are the basic features. Screen shots attached.

---

FEATURES:

- SIMPLE Encrypt / Decrypt Email on the fly. Also all incoming and outgoing email using zero-knowledge encryption  ( click the little lock and email is encrypted

- Multiple accounts

**For example your account might look like this:**

John@xinja.com
John_Spam@Xinja.com
John_Family@Xinja.com
John@Gmail.com ( Imported account )
John@Yahoo.com ( Imported account )
John@live.com ( Imported account )
OneTimeUse@Xinja.com (Good for 24 hours then becomes inactive

- #tags

- “Oops” filter; add a timer so you can make changes to your email if you sent it in haste.

- #Urgent
Use #tags in the subject title to automatically filter importance of email.

**Example:**

to: Wife@xinja.com #Urgent!
don't forget to take billy to soccer!

This email because it has the #urgent tag and will notify you via email
This way you never miss an important email.

** @tags **

**Example:**

@tags used in Calender:

@Calender Fri
Don't forget to pick up billy from soccer! #urgent! #milk

The following message would automatically update your calendar as well as send you email
reminder you on the specified date.

**@tag Example(s): **

@t sends a tweet ( brings up the 140 char limit counter )

@t+username will send a tweet to a specific person. e.g. @t+wife don't
forget the milk! and pick up a pizza for dinner!

@f posts to your facebook status

@f+username posts to a persons wall.

@milk will post to ""Remember The Milk""

@f

@sms will send you an sms. e.g. @sms 9:50PM 11/15/10 awesome show on
Discover Channel!
Combine commands.

@t
just tweeting and updating my facebook status via my email! yay
technology! #xinja is awesome!!!

**Super user mode: **

(enabled by default) super user mode allows you to rid yourself of options that clog up current email services while minimizing mouse clicks. This will save time and will allow you to do multiple things at one time.

**With Super user mode you can: **

Combine multiple emails as well as twitter
The following is an example of a single workflow. Only one window was ever opened but all of the following is accomplished using text iput and commands and tags.

** Example. **

To: wife@xinja.com
cc: wife_work@Microsoft.com
Subject: Hey

Hi Honey

Pick up some pizza and a six pack of Pepsi. Also

love you!

/End

@t having pizza and Pepsi for dinner today whoot woot!

Initially the # of users using the service would be so small that it wouldn't cover the cost of a single VPS - so I'd need to collect some up-front bitcoin donations to make sure at least 3 months (should be under 1.5btc) of hosting is secured.

I have a rooted Android running Cyanogenmod 7.x. I plan on upgrading my device in the near future and will repeat the process of rooting. For now

I have growing concerns, did some reading, and even found Orbot and installed it on my device. As it is, all apps on my device are funneled (transparent proxy?) through Orbot (Tor). I also have Orweb, which is a very stripped down browser that is also created though the Tor Project. I've never had an issue with bootstrapping and all appears to be fine. I'm not a programmer, so there are limits to my skills.

The browser (Orweb) was horrid... not tabs

But the browser (Orweb) sucks donkey balls, configured as described through Tor. (I disabled the Google, Amazon, Twitter, and Wikipedia addons that came with Firefox). I can even get the connection message as I've seen using the Orbot browser.

1). I know I should approach all things concerning privacy with skepticism and Id like to know if any of you have experience (or warnings) about this particular setup? My Android is my main device.

2).  I'd like to know if there are other preparations I should make before an exploration of the onions. What are some of the sorts of things I should ""pack for my trip""? I downloaded and installed KeePassDroid (password management), I don't know the first thing about IRC), OI File Manager, and AGP (I don't know wtf I'm doing with it yet)... 

3). What can I do to better secure my device (ie.

4). What can I use to create public keys (for use in sending and receiving encrypted mail

5). What are some othe facets of my device I should be concerned about (ie.

In my case, and having signed up with a normal IP prior), but by using Tor my ISP would not be able to see what I'm doing, and the exit node would be unable to see anything important (because of the SSL). Plus, as a bonus,  I could help improve Tor's anonymity by including ""boring"" communications in the stream. But will having two “identities” interfere with each other? 

Another example, would Facebook be able to detect the second account? Note, I'll be running a vanilla Tor Bundle Browser, except with JavaScript turned off. 

The only potential negatives I find with this setup are as follows: the concern that a malicious exit node would do a Man-in-the-middle/fake SSL attack (as apparently occurred [back in 2009](http://hackaday.com/2009/02/23/sslstrip-hijacking-ssl-in-network/)).

[actual webpage](http://school0fanon.tumblr.com/Security)
[text only pasetbin](http://pastebin.com/6EGZm25G)

Basically the process it's stating is this(the actual process is very long


1)Secure HDD (wipe drive, etc)

2)Download tor browser

3)download truecrypt

4)create truecrypt hidden volume on removable media

5)Install Virtualbox

6)Setup VM with damn small linux acting as firewall

7)log in DSL and turn on ssh

8)Get ubuntu

9)Login primary, install guest addons, etc

10)Set ubuntu to use tor as internet connection via changing network adapter from nat to internal network, etc

11) ssh -N -L 9050:10.0.2.2:9050 root@10.0.3.1 
&amp; ssh -N -L 8118:10.0.2.2:8118 root@10.0.3.1

12) Check tor connectivity

I know the majority of people here have extensive knowledge on tor

To me, more so than just using the TBB; firewall controlling connections, a VM of ubuntu to access, stored in a hidden truecrypt volume that's stored on a flash drive or something. I know this may seem overkill, but my goal is to be as secure as possible; one of my aforementioned friends had a particular nasty run in with vengeful parties in a similar environment (not tor, I believe, but honestly I dont know for sure) and I myself had my identity stolen being what, was super vigilant with personal info online. All of these things coupled with natural paranoia and fear of the unknown in tor has me wanting to be most careful. I've read about opening documents in tor and whatnot

1. Install a base OS (Linux) with full-disk encryption.
2. Install VirtualBox or some other VM app.
3. Set up the VM to route entirely through Tor. (See [this tutorial](http://www.howtoforge.com/how-to-set-up-a-tor-middlebox-routing-all-virtualbox-virtual-machine-traffic-over-the-tor-network) for how this can be done.)
4. Set the system up to automatically boot the VM

I've been considering this for a while, which then decrypts the inner OS (Windows, typically), which then takes over operation of the computer from that point forward.

The difference here is that not only would the system be entirely encrypted

Does anyone know how this could be done? Is there some software that might make this simple? I understand that this would very likely make the computer incredibly slow

Thoughts?


--------------
**Edit:** I've been considering some possibilities here. I guess the primary question is this: Is there a way to boot a graphical VM from the command line, with the sole purpose of displaying the VM?

1) Are there any VPS hosting services that I should stay away from (i.e. Terms/Service prohibit Tor Relays)?

2) What type of Relay would be most advantageous to the network? I'm leaning toward Exit Node.

3) Is there a way to make sure that I don't run over my bandwidth limit? [Tor Cloud](https://cloud.torproject.org/) has a way to cap the bandwidth

Can someone please explain me the difference? Do I understand it correctly when I say non-exit relay means I will switch traffic inside TOR network

My next question is - I'm having my exit relay turned on for 2 days and traffic is always 0KB/s. Also when I check the network map - my relay is not listed in the list. Checking the Message Log it says my relay is up and working ([po 22. 7 11:49:47 2013] Your Relay is Online - Your relay is now online and available for Tor clients to use.

However seeing news stories lately about tor and it's importance in the arab spring, it really started getting to me that I really misused tor, and for the last weeks i've been feeling like the biggest scum in the world. To have done something wrong, possibly harming others, I never wanted to be such a person... I don't want pity, I'm feeling suicidal. So I want to help, but first i have some questions regarding my guilt:

1.) How overloaded is the tor network really

2.) Have i hindered or slowed down freedom? maybe my stupid browsing or one of the times I downloaded slowed down the network enough that syrian rebels didn't get a message in time and got killed? Maybe that's a longshot

3.) If i'm getting good speeds(say over 100kb/S)

4.) Has any exit node user ever been jailed for someone downloading throught it? 


So that's my guilt

What's the best way as a home user to help? I want to help people in oppressed countries particularly

1.) If i'm running an obfuscated bridge/relay could anyone find out I'm the one behind it? I often travel through china and wouldn't want to be detained.  Could i get in trouble any other way? 

2.) If i use torcloud would people know I'm behind it? Would amazon give out my name if China or Iran asked? Can i use an amazon server without giving my name? 

3.) Do obfuscated bridges run independently of normal exit nodes? As in not affected by their use?

4.) Any way to specifically help pro-democracy movements in opressed countries with a tor connection?

5.) What are some good servers i can donate to?

If anyone is interested, I setup Polipo which is a proxy that can interface between TOR (SOCKS5) and a regular HTTP request over TCP. Once you've setup and have Polipo running you just redirect all your requests through that, Polipo however needs to know in turn to route traffic through TOR which means you specify a SOCKS proxy for it in the configuration file i.e.
socksParentProxy = localhost:9050

The attacker then modifies the IV in memory (using a malware/rootkit) in order to weaken the session key and make it predictable. The attacker will then have to force the tor client to use the infected tor relays as the 3-node circuit
  
Is this threat conceptual only? I mean, the really difficult task is forcing the tor client to pick the 3 infected nodes as the circuit. BUT if you were CHINA/IRAN, you can simply block all access to all relays/bridges except for the infected ones.  
  
So
  
Also, unless the Tor foundation says otherwise. It doesn't appear that they have published the source code. So, did the Tor guys realize that this is a real security issue and thus asked Eric not to publish anything?  
  
Anyone here has the full story?

In need of some serious anonymity here.
