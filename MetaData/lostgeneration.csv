You won't know until its too late.

You had me work grave shift for Christmas Eve, unarmed, alone.  You appointed an incompetent manager who shows up late every single day.  You cut my hours when I hurt my back to punish me for calling in sick, even though I gave you 2x the required notice.  You make me tell homeless people that they cant sleep where they are because you don't want a smelly poor person making your pretty property look like reality.  You don't pay me enough. 

I've been quietly fomenting dissent among the ranks.  We want better pay, you can't realistically work 40 elsewhere.

I'm so very close to securing 50% of the staff for union cards.  Tantalizingly close.

You're going to regret talking down to me.  You're going to regret walking into our meeting, you just can't ask the client to pay more money.  So instead of making a 40% profit, you could make a 38% profit - but you'd rather insult us with burger coupons and movie tickets.

Movie tickets don't pay rent.  Burger coupons can't get my mom decent health insurance.

You're going to regret every single instance you took advantage of us

Union.

You think you've got us.  You think we're nothing.  You have no idea what were capable of when we're united; there is power in a union.

In £30k debt from student loans.

Ancient fucks laugh on a political talk show about how the spiralling national debt problem is now the next generation's issue.

Conversation moves into pension funds and how they're all underfunded. Host suggests 'the youths need to just get jobs and give higher contributions to pension schemes! It's tough times and we're all in it together!'. Fuck you. You're retiring to a nice villa at 65. I'll still be working at 75.

More people are living with their parents than ever before. Our generation can't get on the property ladder. The last feels entitled to buy all the affordable housing meant for us

Lastly, they'll be dead. It'll be our and our children's asses trying to survive climate change.

TL;DR:

Student debt + national debt + insolvent pension funds + unafforable housing prices + climate change inaction = a lifetime of paying for the excess of past generations.

Like you, and what worked out and what didn't.

Here's a brief list of things I'd do:

1. If you're jobless, etc. Instead of burning out, get your teeth into something.
2. Be very wary of established groups of other people trying to tell you what the ""source"" of your problem is. They're just recruiting you as footsoldiers in their political and social crusades
3. Do not be afraid to move in with your parents
4. Give up any personal habits that do not lead to your furthering your own future. Sadly, and playing a lot of video games. These habits just suck you in and consume you.
5. Find the smartest people you knew in high school and hang out with them. They will be finding companies where you have options to work and do well.
6. Figure out what it is you like doing. Don't think of jobs
7. Fuck the Baby Boomers. I can't stress this enough: they grew up in the biggest population boom in history, repeat the slogans they shouted when they were kids, live through the same drama that they did. There's something wrong with them. It's illegal for me to tell you to rise up and murder them all with axes, but it's worth considering. They can't arrest all of us.",,False,self,False,t3_uc3uo

Here are a few things they didn't know:

In 1979

In 2009 those numbers were up to 18.5 hours of minimum wage for public school and 64 hours a week for private school.

Internships are now largely non-paying. Not just that, you may want to consider getting just 1 credit, even if you qualify for more, to keep costs down.)

Entry level government jobs are increasingly unpaid

No more subsidized loans for grad school. If you go to a three year program, plus interest on that amount because it becomes capitalized (6.8% for 15 years). If you work minimum wage, you can either pay off the costs of unsubsidized loans in now, or attend 3 years of state university in 1979.

Employers now care about skills over credentials. It used to be that a college degree was a sign of high level general competence. Now it's a sign of moderate intelligence. Employers want more. *And they should.* I don't blame companies for realizing that a college degree doesn't mean much. I do blame the 30 years of blissful ignorance that told my generation all they needed was a college degree without paying attention to how the world was changing.

The biggest thing though that I realized my parents don't understand about college today is that many of us leave wanting to do intellectual and creative endeavors. Having an upwardly mobile comfortable income is important,False,self,t5_2r40j,False,,,t3_s24i2

What do HR people do all day? At my current job (yes, she walks around and shoots the shit with employees. That's it. Her busiest days are hiring and firing days -- mainly on account of the paperwork.

Why bring this up? Well, i.e., they're having to -- brace yourself for it -- work, that they found a solution to cut down on their workload: jack up the experience requirements. That pile of resumes that was 200 high is now only 20. Whew ... that was scary. Almost had to do some work.

The same goes for recruiters. Their job is to find people who will bust their ass and work hard. Instead

And, are the requirements -- in terms of experience and/or education -- to do either job? Nothing. I've discovered this via LinkedIn. Anytime I apply for a job and can find the name of the HR person or recruiter, I plug it in and look over their profile. Nine times out of 10 they -- at most -- have a B.S. in something very general, like liberal studies, and do not have a varied job history. Yet, with this insanely limited background, they feel qualified to know who should be hired for a multitude of positions

Every job I've ever got

Ironic

What's amazing is nobody has noticed that the burden for anything has shifted so dramatically. We're called the 'entitlement generation'

A generation ago, you won't build a life for yourself flipping burgers). A generation ago, college was only required for the highest level jobs. Today, even aspiring tradesmen(People who are supposed to be trained on the job!) are told they should try to get college in their chosen trade to even get in.

Let's not even talk about tuition costs. A generation ago, but they don't even have a house.

Then, the previous generation has the gall to hate us for thinking we should have jobs -- or worse, for thinking we should be able to keep a job for more than a few years. Today we're all transient, we all work for an hour here, an hour there. It's very romantic hearing ""He works four jobs"", but nobody remembers to mention that the four jobs only work 8 hours a week each.

This is the natural result of the progress away from actually doing anything. Today, the chair you're sitting in, the clothes on your body, the product in your hair, the glasses on your face, are all manufactured in the second or third world. The only work left in our dying society tends to be moving piles of money from one pile to another, or acting as middle-men between the people who actually create something to the people who consume it.

Even these jobs days are numbered. With the Internet, with free shipping right to my house. Buying it from Wal-mart would cost 4 times as much. How long until everything but perishable items are just shipped right to our homes, and millions find themselves out of work -- just as when the mines closed, just as when the factories closed, just as when the computer and engineering jobs left?

A generation ago, poor people(and guess what -- people without jobs and with six figures of student debt are poor!) have their cars taken away from them because they're just a bit too old to pass the ridiculous tests set up by the government (and you know the tests are ridiculous when you need to cheat to pass -- even new vehicles need to cheat). Ironically, today many jobs demand you own a vehicle, whether it's relevant or not. 

Even societies institutions are falling apart. The previous generation got married like their parents

Where does that leave us? Even though things are worse today, we're also forging our own path, writing a new map.

Last fall I was at Yale doing a useless Masters degree in Religion and hating it so I moved back to Georgia

I'm in $45,000, though she has an undergraduate in mathematics. By the end of our masters degrees we will be in a minimum of $90,000 in student loan debt. We drive a 20 year old car, I work two jobs for a total of 60 hours a week, 6 days a week. She has a graduate assistantship that pays $150 a week and covers 9 credit hours for her. We are with each passing day getting poorer and further in debt. 

Hell

Today I broke down and cried; I'm still crying. I don't know what to do anymore. I work in Walmart for $7.45; I have a BA

EDIT:
I can't believe I'm having to justify my finances here but a few assholes, soonish. So when I got my big ass refund check (refund because I got another scholarship based on my grades but the loans had already been processed), I went HEY now I can get a computer! Then, a little over a week ago my wife and I were trying to figure out how she would be getting to her student teaching in bum fuck nowhere and I would get to work the best solution we could come up with was that she should take the truck and I should get something small, cheap and cheap to insure. Hence buying a scooter. It's not like I went FUCK YEAH FREE MONEY WHOOOH, and then spent it all on whores and coke. Jesus fuck people. Real people who live somewhere beyond their mom's basements have expenses, and occasionally need to make large purchases. Doing so doesn't make them not in a fucked position financially. 

Note I haven't bought a scooter or a computer because I'm not running into anything right now. As for the ""how could you not realize how large your loans are"" crowd: It's easy. Borrowing 5 grand a semester at a place that costs... I don't actually know but the expected cost of attendance is ~$56, because if we were then wages would probably go down. 

I freaked out looking at the total loan figure because the enormity of how fucked I am finally hit. That's why it's called an epiphany!

An evil country is one that engages in torture; one that tries children as adults and has *life* sentences for minors; one where money is considered ""speech"" so those who have the most, whose offices and files were just raided by the DHS this week.

Our sense of humanity left us a decade ago. We left it in Kuwait when we sent our brothers and sisters on a convoy into Baghdad on a pre-meditated and pre-emptive war (the pretext to which I bought into hook-line-and-sinker), but those who would advocate for them would be looked askance, as though *they* were the enemy for wanted decent treatment for POWs. We left it in our prisons, where 34% of black men in Louisiana have lost the right to vote due to incarceration, and the majority of convicts are minorities in for non-violent, victimless crimes- locked away in for-profit prisons. Where is our sense of humanity? We left it in these places, and it's from these places that our country will regain it's identity; they'll take it, and shape it. The only people with any sense of it left are right now burning like white-hot stars

I was about to post something like this on my FB, begrudged nobody does not help. I see facebook as simply a local PR and correspondence tool, despite the reoccurring urge to cry out for help once in a while.

I'm a mid 20's male in a small collage town and only in the last year started covering all my own expenses and managing my life all on my own. The process has been hell, and it is up to me to make of them what I will.

My original point came from feeling like the people who raised me and I was brought up around always talked about every ones potential. How we could become movie stars, world travelers, etc. But never really let on to the fact that there was a LOT of hard work ahead of me, hard work and trying episodes that I still face and see no end to yet.

I don't have any kids myself, often fraught with unexpected problems? **]**

edit: Also I just wanted to post in here to rant a little bit, having her drive me to important things, providing food/shelter, because I saw the local opportunities so abysmally tedious, inefficient even hopless that I hesitated for a long time to jump in and start providing for myself fully. Though I'm glad I began that process in the past year, it was a major shock, and the lengths I had to go through to begin supporting myself have spanned many years and taken a toll on my health. Today I work small time jobs to perpetuate a lifestyle I wouldn't wish upon most people. Single, sciatic nerve and stomach issues, or in assets

Hopes and dreams.

All that this has taught me is that it really does take initiative and effort to provide for ones self. And even more so to work towards an accptable quality of life (what I would find acceptable, they all got to go. I'm plan to experiment with art and craft to see if any profit can be made from sales. Learn and practice new skills and services to offer. Continue learning about math and science in hopes of one day doing something with the knowledge. Learn programming and web development free online, etc. I can't tell what the future will bring. I just hope I can make things happen for me and find a comfortable way of life.

I'm giving up my toxic relationship with my mother. I will still interact with her, my family, or my life. I am giving up caring about her views on my depression (that I just need to ""get out more"" and ""volunteer"" and everything will become rainbows and sunshine), or her views on my not going to school anymore, or her views on my life or how I'm living or my desires or the things I *enjoy* doing that she views as a waste of time.

If I want to ""waste"" my time writing

I'm giving up the need to feel ""mature"" and like an ""adult."" I'm turning 23 in a month and I'm going to cut my hair the way I've always wanted to (even though it's an ""emo"" style and is much more fitting for a teen than an adult)

I am going to give up my guilt about not being good enough. It doesn't matter that most of my friends are about to graduate with their Bachelors - if not their *Masters*! - and I'm not even close to done with my Associates. It doesn't matter if I never get my Associates.

I'm giving up the self-doubt and self-hate that have always been a central part of my person. I am going to learn how to be comfortable in my own skin

I'm giving up feeling lost in an uncaring world. I am going to surround myself with friends and chosen family (like my husband) and god*dammit* I am going to be happy. Because my life does *not* suck. I have depression, okay. But I just realized - I can choose if I want to be those or not.

I am going to begin talk therapy. I am going to continue taking my medications. I am going to eventually return to school and get a degree for whatever I choose I want to do.

So today my boss sends me a message over Google chat that the owner called him in and said I'm going to get laid off. Sales were up 15% over last year and out profit margins are great. So for all that hard work the last five months I get the axe.

What sucks is I don't know if Ill qualify for unemployment since I only worked there 5 months. California's documents on qualifying aren't the best. I'm just angry over all this. Work hard

I understand if I took my own money and put it into a business I would want to reep the benefits and profit from taking all that risk yet at the same time I don't think I could drive around in a $50

Now I'm looking into unemployment benefits, and looking at other cities to move to.

*The devaluation of higher education*. In the 1990s everyone believed that education was the key to economic success, was essential for anyone who wanted a good job as one of those ""symbolic analysts"".

But computers are very good at analyzing symbols; it's the messiness of the real world they have trouble with. Furthermore, it turns out, be done quite well by an intelligent person whether or not she has studied world literature.

This trend should have been obvious even in 1996. After all

Or consider the panic over ""downsizing"" that gripped America in 1996. As economists quickly pointed out, did downsizing suddenly become news? Because for the first time white-collar, college-educated workers were being fired in large numbers, even while skilled machinists and other blue-collar workers were in high demand. This should have been a clear signal that the days of ever-rising wage premia for people with higher education were over, but somehow nobody noticed.

Eventually, carpentry, household maintenance (a profession that has taken over much of the housework that used to be done by unpaid spouses), and so on -- pay nearly as much as one can expect to earn with a master's degree, and more than one can expect to earn with a Ph.D.. And so enrollment in colleges and universities has dropped almost two-thirds since its turn-of-the-century peak. Many institutions of higher education could not survive this harsher environment. The famous universities mostly did manage to cope, but only by changing their character and reverting to an older role. Today a place like Harvard is, as it was in the 19th century

Share your tips on how you're one-up on our crappy society and its BS and assist your peers.

I'll go first:
1) Stop blaming boomers for your situation instead of trying to better yourself -- you can always seethe with hatred later when they can't pay for retirement and are working at McD.
2) Write your cover letters and resumes in a unique manner
3) Network effectively. Shoot off 5 emails a day to people you'd actually like to work for while stressing your strengths and that you'd like to work for them. (I actually got my job this way). Apparently 80% of job vacancies are not publicly posted -- I believe it.
4) Freelance
5) Tune out negativity. Surround yourself with ambitious smart people -- smarter than yourself if they'll tolerate you. Don't let people talk you out of what you want.
6) Don't subscribe to the college &gt; job &gt; marriage &gt; kids &gt; retire &gt; die plan if you don't want to. There are infinite possibilities. Frankly

Become a Customs broker.

[What is a Customs broker?](http://www.boskage.com/whatisabroker/)

**What are the requirements?**

* Be a U.S. Citizen
* Be at least 21 years old
* Not be a current U.S. government employee
* Be of good moral character
* Pass the Customs Broker License Examination
* Submit a broker license application with appropriate fees
* Investigation and approval of application by CBP

The test itself is offered twice a year by Customs (Oct. and Apr.) and costs $200 to take

You'll need the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) and Customs regulations (Chapter 19) to take the test - both available online for studying

**Why am I recommending this?**

* Imports are huge business right now
* It seems like most people don't even know what Customs brokerage is. This is good for someone wanting to get into the business
* Many people in this business are old. And they're going to retire in the next 10-15 years. It's a big opportunity for people our age.

A little bit about me - 29, and found myself unemployed for about 6 months not knowing what to do. My degree is in Film so it's just another ""worthless"" liberal arts degree, but I knew I didn't want to end up in the retail or service industries (NTTAWWT).

A family friend in shipping recommended taking the Customs Broker exam and since I had nothing else going on, I landed a job at a Customs brokerage/freight forwarder doing Customs entry writing (the data entry work required for imports).

Started at $14/hour and three years later I'm making $40, and a yearly bonus (not great, but I don't have my license yet, either). I'll be taking the exam again in October and with all my experience I feel pretty confident about passing.

**Payscale.com average Customs broker salary** - (http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Customs_Broker/Salary)[http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Customs_Broker/Salary] - Somewhere between $35k-75k/year depending on experience and location.

**TL;DR** - Start studying for the October Customs Broker exam now. Look for a job as a Customs entry writer and make sure you let them know you'll be taking the Customs broker exam. It should be a good way to get your foot in the door.

The best thing is that once you have your license, and a phone. But it would be best to get some office experience first, learn how to handle shipments, and then maybe 5-10 years down the line think about the self employment route.",,False,self,False,t3_w53dr

I have almost been hired for two really good jobs and then been declined for the position due to the poor credit score i receive. I just got the 2nd rejection today. I know the student loan debt is high but what else can you do when you make just barely enough to get by and have to buy $1

I don't go to some super amazing school it just the state college i live in. I barely make enough to have the occasional meal that isn't pre-packaged crap. 

It is depressing to know that i will never make enough to be able to stay in the United States once my degree is completed. The payment the hospital is asking for is $600 a month which is the interest per month plus about 50 bucks. It will take me around 100 years to pay it back at those rates. The payment my student loans will be asking for is $350. I'm sure i can work something out to make the minimum payments on the credit cards for around 100 bucks. So when I'm out of school i will have to make at least $1050 in payments every month. that is $12,000 after taxes. Minus the $12,600 you come to $20,400. $1,000 a month for expenses like bills, rent, and car insurance I will have $8,600 and bam my savings for the year is $4

$5k a year and no fun for the rest of my life. Sounds amazing huh.

Tl;DR: If i stay in the US for the rest of my life I will undoubtedly be working poor for the rest of my life. I've never felt more hopeless in my life and I am only 26.

Is this what is called growing up? I'm twenty three and I'm still trying to figure that one out.

I'm fucking sick of feeling sorry for myself, time to try something else. 

In this world, the challenge and the competition that I need to overcome in order to succeed. It's tough, why should life be this tough? Many times I have thought about living a lesser existence (whatever that means) by moving to a different country and making just enough to provide me with sustenance while doing things I want to (making music, outdoor sports, exploring, learning and acquiring knowledge etc.). 

Maybe that's just the cowardly way out. 

I don't think there is a job out there that I feel passionate enough to dedicate to, find a job - that's what's on my immediate to-do list. Whatever job it is, I'll do it. I really don't like how our lives revolve around money but it's a necessary evil to live in this society.

Let me first say, Bill Clinton was president, and college tuition cost a few grand a year.

Yes, gas prices, two wars, environmental disasters, student loan debt. 

I'm not mentioning those things to make you depressed. The default would be to think that we got cheated

They might have the money, we still have hair on our head. If we want, we can stay up all night and still feel great the next day. And our boners are rock solid. 

So let's think very closely about what we want to do with our energy and youth. Let's not succumb to the conditioning that we are still just ""powerless"" children. We don't have to take their shitty jobs or trade our true riches for their paper riches. We can do whatever the fuck we want. 

Let's make a list. What products or services could you provide RIGHT NOW to help bring more happiness and success to others of your generation

Situation is this job is terrible, and we get paid weekly), and the schedule is ALL over the place (I'm available 5:30a-9:30p everyday with the weekly schedule running Sun-Sat being issued late Friday night).  The instability of my schedule makes it impossible for me to do anything, and even when I sacrifice (I worked Thanksgiving, for example) the attitudes of management are very predatory and pissy.  It's not a great job, just an inbetweener.  

I do have another occasional job hosting karaoke at bars that, I hate the manager and assistant manager and the only management I like just stepped down today.

I just wanted to share what may be the stupidest decision or a very liberating one with my fellow lost gens.  I mean I'm staying at the job for the money

As a 26 year old Millennial, bonus, and more responsibility (without the skills to execute on that responsibility).

Besides the generally poor attitude, and unsexy tasks that they are given are beneath them.  For example, if I were to ask someone to take 1,000 identical files with a standard information form in them and enter them into an excel spreadsheet, they would do it carelessly and complain the whole time because they didnt feel it was important enough for them to be doing.  Despite the fact that such an exercise is critical to completeing a project.

It's very frustrating.
