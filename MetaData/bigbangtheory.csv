in this episode doesn't he seem like a regular guy? he notices that penny is attractive and says that she's a significant improvement from the guy that lived there before. he makes comments about her using their shower.

i was thinking how un-funny it would be if he had kept going like this.

Sheldon: It has been some time since we've had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.

Leonard: That's not true. Remember at Thanksgiving my grandmother with Alzheimer's had that episode?

Sheldon: Point taken. It has been some time since we've had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn't want to rip our eyes out.

Leonard

Penny's career has gone nowhere and never will. She's in a dead end job living well beyond her means and her slide into alcoholism is increasing in velocity significantly. Her father wanted a boy and she can't seem to keep a relationship going with a significant fear of commitment. She has anger outburst and violence problems

Raj is a lonely closet bisexual

Wolowitz is clearly missing a father figure

Bernadette has a bunch of bodies in a shallow grave somewhere. Almost sure of it.

Should we even start in the litany of pain that was Amy's life?

Wow.

Throughout the final season, and punishments have tortured him for the past *x* years. It's time for it all to end. In the season opener, he makes the decision with Howard and Raj to break every single rule in the notorious *Roommate Agreement*. Throughout the season, Sheldon lets it pass. We aren't sure why he's being so lenient on Leonard, but he is.

In the series finale, wiping his butt with Sheldon's toothbrush, anything that the fan base would be just as shocked as Sheldon). Leonard leaves, defeated and shocked at Sheldon's readiness to kick him out. Leonard has given his final goodbye.

Or so we thought.

You may remember that [part of the Roommate Agreement is that if one invented time travel, we see a time machine materialize in front of Sheldon. Sheldon is shocked, and delighted. The doors open and an elderly Leonard Hoffsteader comes out. Sheldon loses his mind. He screams and throws a tantrum asking how even after all these years, Leonard can taunt him like this. Leonard gets close to his face.

""I can answer your cries in one simple word.""

""Well

Leonard walks back towards his time machine and holds onto the doors ready to close them

I didn't include a life story and i don't intend to. So the TL;DR version is: I identify with being a nerd

QUESTION: Has anyone noticed this over the past few seasons? I started watching the show around season 2, and I can't help but feel like there hasn't been any character progression, only each new episode is just a 'greatest hits' of jokes from the first three seasons. Every time i hear the laugh track/live audience, i just hear people laughing AT 'those nerds' instead of with them.

TL;DR: Do you think that TBBT is a show about nerd culture or mocking nerd culture?

EDIT: I really don't care weather it's a laugh track, its about the humor.

EDIT EDIT: There also seems to be a misconception that I am complaining about the jokes not having enough 'nerdcore' humor in it. I am not. I appreciate that the show has evolved to accommodate the larger audience that the show has gained. I am all about opening up the from the foundations if 'nerdcore' humor to cater to the larger audience.

The jokes that she makes are mean and nearly always at someone elses expense. In the episode where Bernie breaks up with Howard just before the wedding instead of making her friend feel better she accuses Bernie of bringing it on herself.
