We have the episode where Howard and Raj use satellites to spy on the girls in the America's Next Top Model house as they sunbathe topless on what they thought was their private rooftop patio. Later in the episode they actually enter the house under false pretenses to hit on these women by masquerading as cable repair men. 

We have Howard's entire character, she later apologizes for hurting his feelings.

I had to post this because I saw an anti-false rape accusation poster (written as a snarky parody of an anti-rape poster) on r/mensrights

I was raped about two years ago by my best friend's boyfriend's friend.  We were at my bff's bf's house, and he left while I spent the next four hours crying. To add insult to injury, he later accused me of ""leading him on."" Sorry, but my exact words that night were ""NO"" and ""STOP.""

Anyway, ""You just regret doing it. I know how girls are."" Even though he was an abusive lowlife, it still hurt. And my best friend said things like, ""Well I'm sure he didn't mean to."" A few months later, when I broke down crying about it, she admitted that she hadn't really believed me. Because of these kinds of reactions, I didn't tell anyone else. I felt like *nobody* would believe me.

I know that false rape accusations can ruin lives. I had a friend who was falsely accused of rape when he was caught in his girlfriend's house late at night

But viewing all people who claim they have been raped as liars, we have a system of ""innocent until proven guilty"" for all accused criminals, but we cannot assume that a person claiming they have been raped is ""guilty until proven innocent"" of making false accusations.

Anyway

Why is it that whenever we see an article about rape in the ""mainstream"" reddits
&gt; I would rather 10 rapists be free than 1 innocent person go to jail. For most It's easier to empathize with the rape victims

Of course

It seems like whenever there is an article about false rape accusations, ignorant nonsense. Reading these threads is like staring rape culture in the face, and it makes me sick.

**Edit:** I feel that I need to clarify a few things:

* I do not believe that ""false rape"" is a myth. I believe that stories about false rape, and the rhetoric these articles inspire is troubling at best. Worse yet, in this case it was used to mischaracterize woman's rights groups, by juxtaposing the comments of a woman's rights spokesperson with the conservative bias of the ""False Rape Society,"" which has its own version of the story. That's plain unfair.
* I don't believe that due process should be changed or abridged in cases of rape. What I'm saying is that we should stop passing judgment when we don't know all the facts.
* And finally, we are not qualified to determine whether she is guilty or not (especially because sexual assault is a complicated matter, and sadly one that not everyone fully understands).",,False,,t5_2qhba,,http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/f99a4/in_response_to_the_1_article_on_rredditcom_right/

One thing in particular set me thinking. A woman was commenting on trans women and saying that

I wondered what my insider knowledge of it is. I must have some because I have seen how men work from the inside

It seems like some radical feminists think that there is an open knowledge of it among men

The best way I can think to explain it is to co-opt an analogy used by Richard Dawkins on the subject of evolution.

When you see a pack of swallows flying in a group, they follow local rules that get programmed into them from birth.

And that's pretty much how patriarchy works in my experience. Men haven't all gotten together. It works

My stumbling block is that I am an Hispanic woman in the south. The culture of where I grew up is not kind to feminist ideals.  There were always things that I enjoyed that were ""masculine"": construction trucks(as a wee one), building things, race cars. 

Some things were seen as ""acceptable"" and by that I mean it was ""sexy"" if a woman could hold her own or take care of her car. Others brought shock and confusion to my parents and family. I wasn't ""lady like"" in any sense. I didn't and don't wear makeup often

I dated and found men who shared my ideals. I went on a date to a science museum and people couldn't fathom why I didn't want to go to an upscale restaurant instead. But I loved what I loved and found people to date who shared my interests. I asked men on dates

My parents and my grandmother were proud of my mind. I was beyond bright and took to the sciences. 

My parents were ashamed of my appearance. No matter how smart or accomplished I was, to show off. They want a girl who dresses nicer, who is thinner, who wears make-up, and can cook and do housework.  Even the nerd boys who I dated, with the unkept hair, ratty jeans

My grandmother bragged about me to her friends; her granddaughter who was so good at math. 

What did it mean for me growing up, even when my mom worked more hours then my dad. Men were to pay for me, to open doors for me, to take CARE OF ME. me! Who thought herself so independent was mistaken it seemed.

I and shocked, horrified, and dumbfounded.",,66,11, am considered a whole human being with every right to fulfill my potential as a man. I had no idea how BAD it was - or rather I had a simpleminded idea that didn't take into account the actuality of living to the housewife expectations. But I think I am most shaken by the notion that I just read

My mother killed herself in 2006. She was raised within the mystique to a pathological extent. When she was a young teenager my grandmother would starve her and her sisters because we run big in our family, and that was all they could ever hope to be. And so they are. My aunt is married to a wealthy man and dabbles in art, my other aunt is an escort, and my mother went through four marriages before she eventually killed herself. 

My mother was a brilliant woman. She was a talented artist, she started nursing school. But one day, my then four or five year old older brother told her ""I need a mommy, not a nurse"". She quit that day. And It seems to me she also quit having any plans for herself, her life, other than wife and mother, and whatever affairs she could wrangle up on the side (which were a lot). Just as it said in the mystique, her job

She wrote a couple of books that could have been published had she been willing to do the editing required. She got  a BA in art and could have gotten a Masters and become a teacher, of a ..let's call him a minor celebrity. My mother did eventually seduce and befriend this minor celebrity. He dabbled with her, and then went on to marry a woman in her young thirties whom he could have children with. She obsessed about him for a couple of years and when she finally realized it was never to happen, and (I think) that she was going to get older and lose her looks, she shot herself. I know that isn't the whole reason but it is a lot of it. Her function was gone. Her self imposed reason for living was being taken away by the years and I guess she couldn't stand it. 

The worst part is even though she had a man in her life who did (and still does) love her without limit, and threfore"" wasn't good enough"" for him. She had to live trhough a successful man. Every man she had married was a ""successful"" man who hadn't loved her back. But this fat waiter loved her, the very heart of her, and she turned him away in favor of some ""status"" man she could never have - who would fulfill her own need for a self. It enrages and saddens me - on top of the sadness of having lost my mother I slowly start to realize I never had her in the first place - this cultural idea took her from me way before I was born. 

I even see these ideas in active in my own life and self-regard. I see how guilty I feel for not ""using"" my beauty, and I realized that I had nothing much inside but dreams. No real opinions, no real stances - just a vague notion of whatever interested me, whatever might best please who I was around. I'm working through that trying to find more of myself, as it were, but before I read this book it never occurred to me that what I was suffering was a cultural symptom, handed down, all my life, follow my mother's morbid footsteps into the dark. It wasn't until I read this book till I realized how I grew up and what I have been denying myself

I really must ask for your help - currently in Northern Ireland it is illegal for women to have an abortion (unless life threatening danger). HOWEVER because we have the unusual benefit of 'dual citizenship' in my country, as our country is currently under UK government and law.

In Ireland, only **four politicians spoke on behalf of our people, to tell them that we were a religious country, and that we would not welcome an extension of the law**.

I don't have to tell you how undemocratic that is.. but it gets worse. The United Kingdom has the HIGHEST teenage pregnancy rate in Europe

As we are legally capable of having abortions within the UK, often fighting severe pressure from both Doctors and otherwise (I've been in the room when escorting a friend - so I can speak from first hand experience) are forced to *fly* to the UK *and back* immediately after the procedure. That is, of course, IF they can afford it. Most can't.

Our schools do not teach appropriate sexual education

As a highly 'religious society'

This week, but these opportunities are few and far between and with the recession, they are even fewer. With a local clinic, potentially over [300 teenagers](http://www.fpa.org.uk/media/uploads/professionals/factsheets/northern-ireland-factsheets/northern-ireland-teenage-pregnancy.pdf) (recent drops in statistics are mostly recession influenced) will finally have the opportunity to turn their circumstances around.

I know our numbers are small

Please go to our national paper, there is a small poll asking; ""Do you believe the Marie Stopes abortion clinic should have been allowed to open in Northern Ireland?"" - **Please vote YES**.
Currently the poll stands at 45% Yes and 55% No. 

If you'd like to take it one step further

Today r/Feminisms, stand with me and my country, please help us stop this madness and help the predecessors of the women I've seen suffer, not have to *ever* suffer again.

Of course this is offensive and problematic.  Equating body shape/size with attractiveness is not okay.  Perpetuating body shame is not okay.  Marginalizing entire groups of people for the benefit of others or to make a profit is not okay.  He should be ashamed.  I'm honestly quite shocked that he had the gall to say that so bluntly and so publicly.  I am happy to see that this sort of statement is being met with such fierce indignance

But that's not actually want to talk about here.  I want to talk about the way in which people are responding.  Every single reaction I have come across so far has made some mention of how hypocritical it is for an ""ugly"" guy to have this kind of attitude.  Does nobody see how flawed that argument is?  That is body shaming TOO.  The fact that we think Jeffries is ugly is not only based on an arbitrary construction of what attractiveness is, muscular guy, his statement would be just as offensive.  Rather than sinking to his level and further perpetuating and participating in this body-shaming culture, would we not do better to take a critical look at what is actually being said, rather than the person saying it?
