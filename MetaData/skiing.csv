I was the only creature stirring
My ski bags were packed by the front door with care
Because the mountain was calling and I'd soon be there. 

I couldn't stay nestled all snug in my bed
Cuz visions of fresh tracks danced around in my head. 
Newschoolers on my computer
Was keeping me from getting my much-needed nap. 

When outside my window there arose such a clatter
I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter. 
Away to the window I flew in a dash
Tore open the shutters; I got there in a flash. 

The moon glimmering behind the falling snow 
That was quickly covering the objects below. 
When
But an enormous smile that stretched ear to ear. 

My lips had sprung up
I knew in a moment that tomorrow would be sick. 
More rapid than eagles the snow
And it whistled

""Now Vail! Now
On
Snow for every mountain! Let it pile tall! 
Now get your skis! Your boards! Come one

The snow kept falling
And I decided that it'd be best if I were well-rested. 
I heard this when I entered my bed and the snow left sight:

You're good people, but you recently encouraged a Redditor to buy skis that aren't at all what he needs.",Smilemon,84,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/skiing/comments/vndyb/intervention_time_this_subreddit_needs_to_stop/

I'd like to see actual discussion about skis and skiing. I feel that I know my shit pretty well, my mind will be changed and I'll shut up.

**I'll start my actual rant now:**

You guys recommended that a 6'4"" 230lb individual buy medium flex skis that are too short for him. And then also told him that it was okay to ride a park binding that is designed for a 12-14 year old newschool skier. 

This setup would be **borderline** okay for a 5'11"" to 6'1"", and I weigh about 140-150 lbs with all my gear on.

Among serious skiers, it's really gimmicky. Plastic bindings are going to be under a lot of stress with a heavy rider on them. Gear talk can get a bit circle-jerky after a while. You're going to hear a lot of people recommending the Look/Pivot 180 bindings. There is a reason for this. Not all bindings are created equal. In fact, most ski bindings are absolute trash. If you're ever in doubt about what bindings to buy, get something that is all metal, with a good din range. Rossignol FKS 180s are a great buy for larger guys. If you need a smaller din range, the used market for FKS 155s is very strong. There are also good Salomon alternatives. The Griffon Royal Family binding series is generally regarded to be cheaper in construction, and the Schizo is at the bottom of their bindings in terms of durability. 

The skis might not be a terrible buy. If the OP doesn't charge on them, stiffer ski. 

Pep Fujas is 175lbs and 5'8"" on a good day. This is his signature ski. A taller model of this ski is still going to be designed with a smaller skier in mind.

OP, they probably have a lot of value on the used market. Worst comes to worst, just ride them, if you don't ski a lot, your gear doesn't really matter.

There were some good posts in this thread. A few people mentioned that the skis are gonna be too small and not at all oriented toward your skiing style

The only real rational for buying these skis is that they were fairly cheap and readily available in the UK. No one mentioned this

There was one really good comment made

During the past month I made [shreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/snowboarding/comments/nfok3/shreddit_sticker_giveaway_2/) stickers, and I promised that I would as soon as I was done in r/snowboarding. This brings me to two questions I have for you:

1) Would enough of you be interested in getting stickers?

2) Does anyone have a vector file or a general sketch of what you would like these stickers to look like? I know a fellow redditor started working on some ideas (the current logo wasn't too popular)

Let me know what you think boys!
