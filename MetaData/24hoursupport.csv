##Attempts

* Try basic PW guessing
* Opened up netbook to disassemble CMOS battery. Soldered on
* Read that CMOS battery won't help
* Downloaded BIOS' flashit.exe &amp; .fd file

* Shot a rubberband at the screen

I got this laptop off craigslist almost a year ago. I traded some things and a bit of money for it. My model is an Asus G53JW Republic of Gamers [laptop](https://www.asus.com/Notebooks_Ultrabooks/G53Jw). This was my first gaming laptop and loved it. However there was a small problem with the charging port. The prong inside was loose. Eventually it snapped off and I paid about $40 to a local PC repairman to solder another port back on and have it work again.

However..

The problem started happening again and it became loose a few weeks ago. It still worked if I moved it in the appropriate position for charging, and a flame sparked inside for a quick second. I haven't touched my laptop since.

I'm a broke senior in highschool and have no idea what to do. Would Asus be able to replace this by any small chance? I need this computer for my graphic designing and am really out of luck.

I just got done finishing my build and I left the case open then I connected my keyboard, heard silence and saw smoke. I panicked and unplugged the cord so quickly I cut myself badly on my thumb hitting an edge of the case.

I don't know where the smoke came from but nothing powered up no fan or nothing. When I pressed the power button all I saw was smoke and I quickly unplugged the cord.

The power supply I was previously using on my previous computer and it's been working completely fine. I used standoffs. I'm sitting here tearing up and dumbfounded as to what went wrong. I see no blown capacitors on the motherboard however I believe I see some burnt on the power supply.

After I recorded the video I remembered that the first time I put it together I connected the case fan to CPU fan 2 instead of CHA Fan 3. Was that what fucked everything up? Was such a simple careless mistake it? fucking fuck.

Was the power supply I used not suitable for my motherboard or something?

Fuck me man. What the fuck did I do wrong because this powersupply was working before. how did this massive failure I call myself fuck up? I can't fucking do anything right. Why the fuck did I even try? What fucking good am I.

Are the rest of my parts fried? What are my options?

Situation: The girl sitting across from me showed me that her mouse cursor on her desktop PC has been hijacked.  These aren't random movements.  The person controlling the mouse clicks the IE addr bar and types out URLS, and worst of all, tried to sign up this girl for Viagra emails (by clicking an ad in the right-hand pane).  We had to fight for control of the mouse!

Troubleshooting: I checked for malware; none found (I've cleaned so many computers of malware I'd say I'm almost an expert at it).  Made sure McAfee was updated (it was), that narrows it down to the wireless mouse and keyboard.  I take out the wireless receiver for the Microsoft Mouse, and the cursor still moves.  I take out the receiver for the wireless Logitech keyboard, and the cursor movement stops.  Ok, bluetooth's range is only 30 feet, hmmmm....

Known facts: No one in our business is hacking this computer, to no avail.  No one at this business is sophisticated enough to pull this off; especially without laughing.  One time it happened and everyone was at lunch, so I know it's no one here at work.  We are on the top floor, so there's no one above us.  There is a company below us, but we went down there and they were closed that day.  Beyond that, it's a textile showroom anyway, so there aren't any PC's within 30 ft of this girl's desktop.  When we close the blinds behind this girl, usually a week or two apart.

Question for you all, and as I said earlier, it still happens with the Ethernet cable completely pulled.  If someone COULD pull off a bluetooth hack at this level, would it even go through their windows AND ours?  Seems so unlikely.

Now, I realised I'd have to take it back out to put the RAM into the slots behind it.. and well, I was getting pretty tired.

I connected up everything else, it's just a constant speed - Nevertheless, the temp was reading at about 18' C, so I wasn't too bothered about it.

Everything else went fine - after a bit of wiggling around, I of course, began overclocking. I used the Asus AI Suite to do this for me, and got up to 4.7ghz out of the cpu. I probably could have gotton it higher if I did it manually, but at the same time this was more than suitable for me - and I was looking to start the benchmarking process, of course.

The system started locking up around this time - sometimes during a benchmark, etc etc. First thoughts being graphics card, I removed one of the GTX590's, and things started going smoothly. Rang dabs and they were happy to refund it.

Now, or when the machine was under load - often during a game of starcraft2 (or anything that was pushing the card), the display would stop receiving a signal, and the audio would start skipping, until a hard reboot was done. Event log was showing Kernel-Power as the issue. One, the PC managed to recover - and displayed a warning stating that the Nvidia kernel had stopped responding, and was recovered. So, another fucked graphics card. With this, I set the CPU back to it's stock speed

I said fuck it, I did ensure to try with different drivers (rollbacks, stable, and beta drivers - ensuring not to install that bloody HD Audio Driver).

New cards arrived, showing up Q-Code 69 (System Agent DXE initialization is started). Now, the odd thing is that when this happened, for the first time ever, the Cyclone fan mounted on the RAM actually spun up to 4200rpm, and remained stable there.

Process of elimination started

Finally, the PC wouldn't completely lock, but would freeze up for 5 seconds, respond for a second, freeze up again.. etc etc, leading to a hard reboot. I started the process of again trying every driver available, to no avail. At one point

So

My system specs:

OS: Windows 7 Home premimum

CPU: Intel Core i7 3770k with Intel HD Graphics 4000

CPU cooler: ZALMAN CNPS9500A-LED 92mm 2 Ball CPU Cooler 

Mobo: Asus P8Z68-V Pro Gen3

PSU: Cougar 1000w CMX

GPUs: Nvidia 670 GTX x2 

SSD: Samsung 840 series 250GB SSD

HDD: 2x 2TB WD HDDs 

RAM: Corsair vengeance 32 GB (4x8) DDR3 1600   

 
What is going wrong:

1: The Built-in graphics of the CPU (i7 3770k Intel HD 4000) does not work.

2: PCIe 16x_2 (the second slot for a graphics card) does not work    

 

Problem 1: When I plug in a screen via a DVI
Mobo it does not display anything. 

What I have tried: 

-Tried multiple screens

-Booted the system with no graphics card installed using the HDMI port on the mobo

-Tried to select the CPU graphics as the primary graphics in my bios (under system agent conguration). The iGPU Option is missing when it was present before.

-Restored Bios settings to the default settings

-Re-installed/Flashed the BIOS

-re-seated the CPU

 

Problem 2: PCIe 16x_2 slot does not work/ computer does not recognize any graphics card plugged in. Both cards power up (fans spinning)

What I tried:

-switched the graphics cards places on the mobo

-Booted with only one 670 at a time in the first slot

-double checked the SLI bridge placement

I am very upset this system is not working after performing so well  for 3 months. It stopped working randomly after no hardware or software changes. I would love any help or fresh ideas. Thank you! 

I just discovered this reddit and will try to pay any help forward by helping others out here.

Setup

* logical 1 partition 1 -OS

* logical 1 partition 2 - oracle

* logical 2 - oracle database.


I added logical 3 drive so I can migrate logical 1 partiton 2 over. I stopped all the oracle services. Then I proceed to do a robocopy and mistyped the drive letter so it wiped out the oracle database. Although I press ctrl C but it still overwritten the file structure and I'm left with an empty drive.

I'm shitting myself because whoever set it up in the first place has put the backup on the same fucking physical drive which I overwritten. In addition no one knew about this server so it isn't backed up on tapes.

The data is extremely sensitive and  is monitored by the government as it is a biorepository. It contains about 2 years worth of research records. If the data is lost

Luckily I convert it to a VM before I done anything to it as I know there is no backup. I got 5 hours left before their script kicks and prod the server which will flag up and by Monday I probably don't have to bother going in to work. 

I'm slowly copying the database over. Robocopy is suppose to retain the permission but I have no idea if it is going to work.....

Could there be any other reasons to it? I'd just like to know if there's anything else I should keep in mind. How fast could one realistically expect it to be repaired

Any help would be much appreciated.

The computer is a Toshiba Satellite L505 running windows 7 with 4 GB of ram and a Intel Core 2 Duo processor.

Google Chrome seems to be especially slow

The computer has been running AVG free version for a long time and it's never found a virus.  I've also tried malware bytes which didn't fix the problem either.  I've started in safe mode and it still runs slow.  Opening task manager and checking the start up programs

I know the problem is pretty vague but I'm at a loss of what else I can try.  I was thinking of wiping the hard drive and doing a re-install of windows as a last resort.  Anyone have any ideas?

[](/stillbroke)

Edit:  Looks like the hard drive is failing.  We got a message from windows a couple days ago saying pretty much to back up everything because the hard drive is crashing.  Does anyone know the best way to get windows over to a new drive?

* I've had my PSU/Motherboard/Hard Drive replaced as to the recommendations of my technician. (Not at the same time)

* My AMD driver has ""failed and recovered"" a couple of times.

* My BiOS is updated to it's most recent version

I didn't set a particular budget because I was mainly relying on second-hand components. After wrestling with dead motherboards and underpowered PSUs, save for a case and a couple of hard drives that I know are in working condition. Here's what I put together:

* [Biostar P43D3 motherboard (LGA 775 socket)](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813138185)
* [Pentium Dual-Core E6700 @ 3.20 GHz](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819116370)
* [2x2GB Patriot DDR3-1333 memory](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820220537)
* [ATI Radeon HD 5770 graphics card](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814150447)
* [Sentey ERP500-SS 500w power supply](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817322002)

I made sure to do my research and found that all these components should be compatible. The motherboard only supports DDR3-1066 memory without any overclocking

However, hard drive spins up, lights are on), but the display shows nothing and there are no POST beeps. I know the case speaker works (it's been used before) and during my troubleshooting routine, I powered the computer on without any memory inserted and it beeped like mad. So the mobo should be okay, right? I also cycled the memory sticks individually in the two memory slots and that didn't help, either.

I'm pulling my hair out here. Why would all-new parts that should be compatible fail to play nice with each other? Could the CPU be dead? Or is the power supply the wrong type? I'm not too proud to admit I could have overlooked something

**UPDATE:** See [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/24hoursupport/comments/hz2y1/just_built_a_computer_but_no_display_beeps_or/c1zpojm?context=1). Furthermore, all the components work, yet they don't work together.

Side Notes

I called Lenovo about 5 times with 5 different answers which is typical. I have been told that the unit is not fully compatible with the laptop (it is, that the device itself is defective, and finally but not to be forgotten: we don't support the port replicator drivers (not like it's a Lenovo product or anything...).

Please help

The computer crashes only when playing games.  It will crash to a black screen(I've never seen a blue screen on this PC) and I have to hard reset it.  Sometimes this happens after 10 minutes

I've tried swapping out the following components:  

* replaced the GPU with an old nvidia 9800 I had that never gave me problems.

* replaced motherboard (originally asrock z68 extreme3gen3)

* replaced PSU (originally corsair 650w)

* replaced ram (originally kingston DDR3-1600 8{4x2})

* replaced CPU and CPU cooler(currently using stock cooler that came with new CPU)

* I originally had windows 7 installed and upgraded to windows 8.  Recently did a clean install of windows 7.

I've imaged my windows installed hard drive and put it on both my SSD and HDD, or lost power unexpectedly.""*  

I've used multiple surge protectors and even moved recently so I don't think this would be caused by any issues with power.  I'm out of ideas

**UPDATE**

&gt;So I pulled out the motherboard last night and found one spacer screw in the motherboard tray where &gt;there wasn't a hole.  It was basically right under the GPU(there was no visible damage to the underside &gt;of the mb).  I took it out and put everything back together and crashed again after a few hours.

&gt;When I restarted from that crash I couldn't boot from my SSD.  I took out the SSD(note

Yesterday morning I woke up to a BSOD. After digging around a bit it looks like what's happening is that the SSD vanishes about 4-5 minutes after the system boots up. It runs fine until that point

On a warm reset if I go into the BIOS

Same exact thing happens in safe mode. 

Switched the drive to a different SATA controller (from Marvell GSATA to Intel SATA - MB has both). Same exact symptoms. Updated all drivers - same symptoms. The drive has the latest firmware. 

Reading around online, and I haven't found anyone who's recovered from this. 

I've got a new Samsung SSD on order

Thanks!

[edit] Well, same power, same drive connection, and it's rock solid. Looks like ""vanish a few minutes after booting up"" is an SSD failure mode.

1367494499.0,1djmt6,"I DESPERATELY NEED HELP - Reformatting and installing Windows 7 sounds easy, right? NOPE. (x-post from /r/techsupport)",The_Griz,9,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/24hoursupport/comments/1djmt6/i_desperately_need_help_reformatting_and/

**Keyboard Issues** - While playing League Of Legends one night on friends laptop, it responded by using flash which was bound to the letter d. We ended the game to remake it and in my client, the letter f started endlessly repeating its self without being pressed. Pressed a bunch of letters and it stopped repeating. Re-opened LoL client and when going to type in my password, each letter I typed was typing about 4 or 5 characters at a time into the field. Finally decided to restart, and upon doing so the entire keyboard locked up, extremely loud monotone constant beep blared (I assume from key being stuck, not physically)

I took the computer home with me to attempt to fix whatever this problem was. After endless hours of googling and not really finding any results

* system restore to a previous known working date
* reinstall keyboard drivers
* type every shortcut that alienware includes on their keyboard
* attempt to open the computer to check the ribbon cable on the keyboard (still haven't done
* went into the registry to check whether numlock was on. I recall it being a 2 I believe? It was whichever number option that means numlock is active. I tried to manually change the value back to 0 or 1

I might have done some other things, to having keys like g and h both typing the letter y instead, to then finally after all efforts being exhausted, having no function in the following keys: **G, H, Esc, Left Alt, ' key

This issue was never resolved

This brings me to the current and mind numbingly frustrating problem at hand. **The Windows 7 installation.**

First of all, so you have to make a bootable USB drive for a clean install of Windows 7. Originally I was told to try and just do an Upgrade Install, where I wouldn't actually have to format or wipe any of the partitions, or even reboot windows, just simply run the install from the USB or ISO or whatnot while the computer is logged in and running then delete the old Windows file. This method proved to be futile for me as I encountered several errors while trying to install like missing Autorun.dll, ect. (I don't recall all of the issues)

So I decided that the only option was to do a full clean install and delete/format the old partitions and use a bootable USB.

**Well.**

I tried doing this several ways
In an effort to make this post not insanely long

* Manually formatted the USB drive, I proceeded to select the main partition when prompted and formatted/deleted it and selected it for Windows install (I am a scrub and didn't realize I didn't have to delete the partition, I could have just deleted the old Windows file like planned) 1% into the installation it errors and says that winboot.dll or something like that is corrupt, unable to load ect.
* Second time around I did the same thing only I extracted the files from the ISO onto my computer first, the pre-Windows loading bar would flash for a second, then at the black screen where it says files are loading, it would error out and say something about being unable to boot. I don't remember the specific error
* Third time
* Fourth time I repeated attempt #2 with bootsect once again and got YET ANOTHER SEPARATE ERROR about WinSetup.dll being missing or corrupt
* The fifth time I downloaded an alternate copy of Windows 7 Lite
* Sixth time I repeated attempt #5 but extracting Windows, loaded all the way to the end and then froze indefinitely. I let it sit for over an hour just to see if it would do anything and it did not.
* The Seventh and final time I downloaded the Windows USB DVD download tool to automatically format and create the bootable USB instead of manually in case it was user error.
At this point, loads 100% and then blue screens displaying this error (which I believe is a registry error, even though **I don't have an OS or partition other than the 100mb recovery partition anymore**)

""A problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer.

Forgot to mention that I tried setting up the USB on my computer and booting it on my friends laptop in every different combination of USB drives possible because I was unaware which were 2.0 and which were 3.0. Not sure it it's relevant at all

I opened up the task manager and to my surprise

I let Windows restart the Explorer.exe process, Windows popped up the same error message, saying that my system was low on memory, with Explorer.exe being the culprit.

So this time I manually killed Explorer.exe via the task manager (so that it wouldn't restart automatically), so anyway...

I restarted the laptop to see if that would help. Unfortunately, **the Explorer.exe process begins leaking or ""eating"" memory, all the way up to my full 8 GB** of RAM. It also **uses a steady 13 percent of the CPU**, which is another indication it's doing something strange (that's high for even idling on my laptop).

In looking at the task manager, coupled with it always using that solid 13 percent of the CPU as well...

Now I haven't installed any new software (anything that would show up in Add/Remove Programs, and then Malwarebytes... Neither of them found anything. I ran [GMER](http://www.gmer.net/) for a quick rootkit check, but it doesn't seem to find anything either. However, when I was using MSSE, I did notice that back on April 6, it looked like a Worm was quarantined, which I didn't notice at the time. I removed it totally from MSSE, because the AV progs aren't finding anything now

http://i.imgur.com/1op0Lx8.jpg

Okay, but I was able to ""trace the stack"" or whatever, and it seems like the problem might some how be related to the **ntdll.dll** library. First of all, I remember getting this error message once when I first noticed the problem, when Windows first gave me the initial out-of-memory popup, I think:

http://i.imgur.com/6gmGjWj.jpg

Next

RtlAllocateHeap seemed to endlessly be doing this

http://i.imgur.com/CBEYrnJ.jpg

...and it would have kept going (I presume) until it ate up the full 8 GB

http://i.imgur.com/RtEC1uu.jpg

Right now, common-sense troubleshooting and I noticed that Windows deployed a bunch of security updates within the last couple weeks, so I made sure to install those (also ran the latest April version of the Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool).

I'm normally pretty good at diagnosing stuff like this, and eating it at steady pace of about 5 MB per second).

It seems like it might be some really strong, doesn't it? Anyway, if someone could help me diagnose this, I'd really appreciate it. I don't have enough free external hard drive space to (easily) reformat my system, unless I absolutely have to...

Thanks...

Asus G73-JH

Windows 7 Ultimate 64

**UPDATE:** I've been able to stop the problem from happening while Explorer.exe is open by disabling ALL non-Microsoft shell extentions. Right now I'm giving the PC some time and use to make sure the problem is gone

Here's the long version: Last week a couple of capacitors blew on my graphics card so I got a new one(a 7850.) When I put in my new card my mobo stopped posting, 1 stick of ram, etc) with no luck. Then upon further examination of my mobo I noticed a small black box with 3 connectors above my bios chip and next to a pci-e slot was not connected to the board anymore(the left most connection was broken.) So like the electrical engineer I am not I tried to solder it back on, again with no luck. So I assume either 
1) I have a bad psu which caused both my mobo and my gfx card to fail. 
2) I stupidly broke my mobo when taking my old gfx card out.
or 3) I have no idea

So /r/24hoursupport I need other people's opinion on this. Is it my psu or my mobo? Socket 1366 boards are pretty expensive so should I just sell my i7 920(for how much idk) and get a cheap amd cpu/mobo combo? I'd really rather do this on the cheap because like I said I already bought a brand new gfx card and I'd rather no spend a lot more money. Specifically I am looking at something like this http://compare.ebay.com/like/200698735855?var=lv&amp;ltyp=AllFixedPriceItemTypes&amp;var=sbar for a replacement mobo.

About a month ago, it proved to be more than my computer could handle and my laptop would freeze whenever I tried to stitch that many pictures. I force restarted, abandoned my grand project, and thought nothing of it.

Then, physical memory would go crazy and go up to 99% immediately. Nothing could be done outside of safe mode. The culprit was Microsoft windows search protocol host, which was using all my physical memory. To fix it, I had to disable search indexing on my C drive. Since then, things have been normal.

Here's the situation. I currently have telus internet ""High Speed"" base package (All that's available in my smaller town) that boasts 1.5mb to 6.0mbps download speed... if i even hit 1mbps i would fall to my knees and praise god because i have never gotten over a 580kb download rate.. Yeah i know... but i recently heard about teksavvy that offers a base one of 6mbps now those of you fermilar with both who would you pick? Or would they both be about the same? Both are DSL by the way
Now for eastlink APPARENTLY i don't for what ever reason other then god hates me my house doesn't have a cable like running to it. and they said they can't run a temp one because they hate me (some bs about it having to run over others property even thou the cable box is right behind my house) and they have to wait until summer to bury a cable.
So can anyone give me any suggestions for a person that lives in a small town in alberta?

**EDIT: Wasn't actually related to the HDD at all (as I suspected since the problem started at the same time as the virus). I ran TDSS and didn't find anything, so I couldn't update it but I could scan. The Trojan was also blocking manual updates to WSE, so I uninstalled/reunstalled WSE and then was able to update again - WSE located another Trojan similar, and removed it. All the while MBAM and Spybot were unable to do anything. I installed a trial of HitmanPro, which found another Trojan which revealed that my computer was accessing the net through a proxy (the cause of my Google redirect issue), and removed it.

While that was alright for some games... my FPS in Starcraft 2 and the Diablo 3 beta was just too low. However, GPU and mobo.

I decided to make a small boost in my computers power, Portal and Minecraft. And a lot better performance with other CPU intensive tasks. However no matter how low or high I set the graphics settings I get those graphics issues.

At first I thought the issue was just in Starcraft 2

I really don't know what could be causing these issues

So far to try to fix the problem I've:

* Uninstalled and reinstalled Catalyst Control Center (the ATI/AMD drivers package) multiple times and made sure it was the latest driver
* Used Driver Sweeper to remove all present ATI/AMD drivers while in safe mode... then reinstalled Catalyst Control Center
* Made sure DirectX is up to date
* Made sure all Windows 7 updates are applied
* Taken out the GPU and made sure the PCIe connector didn't have any crap on it
* Checked to make sure either the CPU or GPU wasn't overheating... when I max out both of them the GPU stays around mid 50C and the CPU stays around high 40C
* Ran FurMark to see if it fails... it seems to finish without issue

So what should I do next? Anyone got suggestions on what I should try now? Thanks for any suggestions!

Android 2.3.4
HTC Sense 2.1

I don't know if this is the place for it

It's so simple that it's ridiculous, and I've read through many suggestions, but they don't apply to me.

Here's the gist of it. I changed my gmail password on my computer and my phone didn't sync. After googling it and following suggestions, and that didn't work, and so I figured I must have entered the new password incorrectly the first time and tried it and it didn't work.... you see where this is going. 2 days later the only solution I haven't tried is a factory reset. I really would rather not do that for obvious reasons. Is there anything I can do?

**Edit again: So naturally after I *finally* break down and ask someone... I went to page 2 or 3 of a comment section to find this (and I don't know why it was so damn difficult) but here it is:**

&gt;SOLUTION
&gt;I struggled with this. My google account sync and gmail did not work. If i entered my password for my gmail account

&gt;What you need to do is:

&gt;1. Go you google from your computer.
2. Go into your account settings (click on your name in the top left.)
3. Click on Authorizing applications &amp; sites(Edit) and you will need you google password.
4. At the bottom of this page should be your application code (this is NOT your google password.) if it does not exist like with me
5. Go into gmail app and under settings go refresh
Enter you app code you generated or from your app settings This is the password you enter into your gmail application password request.

&gt;Viola! Everything will work again

**Solution: Deleted partition on flash drive and recreated it.**

I have three flash drives, and one a 16gb Patriot XT

When the HP 1gb drive and Sandisk 2gb are plugged in during boot

When the Patriot drive is plugged in during boot

I have tried multiple formatting schemes. Also note that there is absolutely nothing on any of these drives

* 1gb drive formatted to FAT works, all regardless of allocation size.

* 2gb drive formatted to FAT works, all regardless of allocation size.

* 16gb drive formatted to FAT32 fails, to no avail. I have tried HP format tool rather than windows format tool, to no avail.

I already have 4 primary partitions

Disabling legacy USB support fixes it

The problem does not seem to be exclusive to that computer.  The same drive will not boot on other computers either.

I even tried installing MS system sweeper on it to no avail

I work as an assistant editor at a small post house. We are an insanely small shop with no IT support whatsoever. My expertise is mainly in creative and I'm totally stumped by this. I hope you guys can pull through for me.

We recently discovered that one of our computers was transferring data at an extremely slow speed. It turns out that it was only connecting @ 100baseTX.

I'm working with intel mac pros. These machines should autodetect straight v. crossover cables. I'm guessing that the problem arises somewhere between the switch and the port in the room?

-performed a memory cycling test where I took out all of the memory sticks and loaded one


-Ran Ultimate Boot CD (Has not crashed on me yet when inside this boot-up utility). Examined all the parts


-Ran a utility from the UBCD


-After wiping ran a virus test from an AVG recovery CD and it did not find anything.


-After Virus scan tried to re-install windows --&gt; Shut-down during install. (interestingly, I had to reset the PSU to shutdown. Also this has happened before in above ""shutdowns"", not always sometimes it just restarts, sometimes it does this.)


-I looked at the motherboard to see if there is any blown capacitors --&gt; did not see any blown/bulging capacitors.

Just discovered what seems to be a new virus. Has anyone else encountered this?

Trying to run a game program that previously ran fine

On reboot

Task manager shows ""phoenix.exe"" running. Turns out this is a bitcoin miner that uses your cpu. The problem is, because it is a legitimate program that some people run on their PC to mine bitcoins. The problem is, someone is now running it on other people's pcs to mine coins. 

I simply ran msconfig and unticked these two lines:

""boot_update""  and  ""Keyboard Inf.""   

My concern is
(b)It also appears to have a keylogger component
(c) It interferes with games (For me causes a bluescreen when I ran a game that requires a switch to fullscreen  at max res  - - I guess this interferes with the miner as the miner of course uses the GPU)
(d) I did not install this and even though I have disabled it I have no idea if it will come back OR where it came from.

Does anyone else have more information

Also, please add some sort of optional warning for bitcoin miners!

Currently I am having this problem with my computer, no mini dumps and nothing in the event log.  For about 2 weeks I have had a single line going down my monitor, which never really bothered me at all and just thought ""Oh well, my graphics card is probably going to die soon"" (It comes and goes.  Sometimes I can go hours without it occurring and others it will pop up after about 20 minutes, regardless of what I'm doing).  I heard about the beta for Path of Exile, so I installed it and played for about 30 minutes, and that's when my computer first shut off.  Thinking it might have just been some sort of crash, it shut off again.  Started it up a 3rd time.  Checked all of the temperatures of my graphics card and core temps, it would tell me that it was not shut down properly and gave me the option to boot into safe mode).  After this last time, checked the hard drive the game was installed on for errors and everything showed up clean.  Checking forums and the website

So I'm curious to what you guys think.  Do you think it was the game causing the crashes or having something to do with it

Having a very peculiar problem here. So far I've isolated it down to a possible motherboard problem but even then I'm kind of at a roadblock. $5 Paypal to the most helpful answer here! Here's a brief timeline of shit that happened:

-Fresh new Win7 build

-Installed some Windows updates

-Booted to DVD

-Attempted Shut Down later

-Same problem

-Made a Recovery Disk

-""Last Known Good Configuration"" didn't work

-Burned an Ubuntu disc so I could at least boot into that OS. It gets about 5 seconds into the loading screen

-Attempted to use Hiren's boot cd

-Pulled out my hdd

-Out of curiosity I placed a new hdd in my PC and grabbed my Windows 7 disc to see if it'd allow a fresh install. Same problem - it freezes at the animation screen with the 3 orbs.

-Deciding that clearly my hdd wasn't the problem

-Placed my SSD back in to give it a try.

**And here is where I am now:**

-POST doesn't start right away like it did. When you power on

-When it gets to ""Auto Detecting SATA1 Device..."" it takes close to 5 minutes to find my hdd.

-After 5 minutes of that

-My 2nd hard drive

If I didn't know any better I'd say the motherboard is having problems. However

Also totally serious about the paypal thing.

**Update 3/22 10:00 AM:** Still no progress. I tested out a few games that push my system as a sort of stress test (to see if I'd get a BSOD due to hardware problems (ram, gpu) and all games I threw it at ran just fine.

Memory:
DDR2 PC2-5300

Memory Type: DDR2 PC2-5300

Maximum Memory: 4GB

Currently Installed Memory: 2GB (4x512 MB)

Total Memory Slots: 4

Available Memory Slots:  0


**Questions:**

1) What kind of RAM should I look for? I get confused because I see ""DDR XXX"" and ""PC XXX"" and I don't know what they mean or which I'm supposed to use

2) Is it possible to mix memory amounts such as having 2x 512MB then 2x 1GB for a total of 3GB? Most configurations seem to be 512, 4gb, 8gb and so on, never in between, is there a reason for this?

3) If I wanted 4GB of RAM

4) It seems cheapest to just buy 1 stick of 4GB ram

Thanks for any answers and advice!

I've read online that there's some kind of issue between some Windows update and the Nvidia drivers

Update 1:  In safe mode, hit the registry with CCleaner until it said there were no issues found, looked for hidden drivers (there were none), installed the driver and restarted.

Alright, everything seemed good. He told me to let it charge completely then use it until it dies a couple of times before I started using it normally. He said I should get 4-6 hours off the new battery.

So, which is definitely not what the guy promised when he sold the battery. Hell, even right now it says 40% is 24 minutes. I really hope I just got ripped off with the battery but I'm really thinking something is wrong with my laptop. Any ideas?

PA has encountered a missing or invalid database condition. PA has disabled predictive battery life and power consumption support.

Any idea what this could mean? Could this mean a bad connection between my battery/laptop?

* My original OS install was on a 300GB HDD which is now out of commission and unplugged from mobo
* I backed up a bunch of files via the old OS onto an external HDD which I am still using with new OS install


When I try to access the external HDD from my new OS install to move files over, *myself* and the *Administrators* as users with full access - I still can't copy/open the files.

Plot twist: the only time I can access my files are when looking at some particular files (not a folder or the entire external HDD) &gt; properties &gt; security [and see this.](http://i.imgur.com/0ztu2.png) I have no idea what any of those users are, read, write, move, etc). However, those users don't appear if I check the security settings on the folder level or the entire drive. Also, not every file seems to have those users.

So

**EDIT** 

I am making some progress - it seems if I give each individual folder full access via an added *Everyone* user, and this will take forever to do manually.


**EDIT 2** 

Ok, etc) in one swoop - I have to manually apply this to every single folder and subfolder. That will take hours upon hours. Am I missing something?

**EDIT 3**

Ok, then set full permissions to anything that didn't have them. I went to copy the files and ...9GB copied so far with no hang-ups. I'll wait until all 220GB are copied, but I think I may have got this in the bag.

Recently I got a new modem from my ISP. The first few days I didn't notice anything, seemingly at random. 

I've made sure that there's nothing on my network that could be taking up bandwidth

I've checked with my ISP making sure there's nothing wrong with my connection to them, I'm at a loss trying to figure out what it might be.

Any suggestions? I've tried updating my network cards' drivers.

My modem is a Zyxel p2812

**Edit:** Some additional details.

At my computer station my signal strength often jumps between 1 and 5 bars. First I thought this might be part of the problem, the problem persists. 

Also, and my ping rarely goes over a maximum of 250 ping, and stays at an average of 20. However, applications like Ventrilo or League of Legends can get a ping of 5 000 or more for several minutes.

I've had a netbalancer running in XP to see if any hidden applications are using a lot of bandwidth

**edit 2:** Further details
I've tried placing another cumputer running windows 7 next to mine at my computer desk. Having vetrilo up and indling on both I can observe the ping staying stable and low on the machine running windows 7

Worth noting is that the signal strength on the windows 7 machine is pretty stable at 2/3 bars, while on mine it keeps jumping between 5 Mbps and 130 Mpbs all the time.

I have noe clue what might cause this. It was pretty much fine a few days ago. I'd prefer not to reinstall windows

[](/solved)

**Edit 3:** I fixed it.
After some time I finally figured it out. I thought my network card drivers were up to date, my drivers are from 2008. With my new modem I got a WPA2 encryption, where as my old modem had just WPA. Apparently, with my drivers being old, my network card couldn't handle WPA2, making it choke sometimes during encryption/decryption. I couldn't find any newer drivers for my network cards chipset in XP, so I ended up switching the encryption,,1349079083.0,t3_10ph35

My PC is randomly ""locking up.""  At first I was having BSODs, even if my CPU does jostle around a bit.  My keyboard, mouse, and screens just ""lock up"" and then my computer will automatically restart or I will have to manually do it.  There is really no rhyme or reason to when the lockups occur.  Even now I've been running for an hour and it's going well.

Not even my repair shop could fix it,What_Noooo,8,1,43,"Hello i recently build my own gaming PC (excuse the lack of punctuation both keys are broken on the computer I'm using at the moment ) I had heard that occasionally this can go wrong because its just harder to do yourself obviously but i said screw that and rolled the dice! everything worked good for about a month but then i started to crash very often and even blue screened once

I notice it happens around the time my computer seems to be under a bit of stress like when i open a new tab when there is already one open or watching youtube videos and most depressing of all playing video games! 

So i took it to my repair shop and they said to simply reformat my hard drive that should do it! but go figure it did not after that they told me to buy a new graphics card because my nvdia hd 570 super clocked would for whatever reason just no work with my computer so i did what they said anndddddd

about a week into my new graphics card the problem starts up again! i still cannot watch videos or do anything stressful except play video games which is extremely strange

Ive noticed it always seems to happen around an update of some sort (video game update or windows updates things like that) I suspect its the drivers but for two different card?! seems pretty unlikely 

any help you can offer would do me a world of good I've spent so much money on this thing and done a lot of work id really hate to find out i have a dud

i first did a clean wnidows 7 install in UEFI mode. However boot times were just under thirty seconds and the out-of-the-box software (samsung magician) kept having errors when i tried to run the performance optimizer.

i then tried a fresh reinstall in legacy mode which seemed to go smoothly. However i only got boot times of around 18-19 seconds. While this is a decent boot time

also it seem to be getting worse. i tried tweaking some things in msconfig (which didnt help) and after restoring the settings back boot times have gone up to +/- 28 seconds again...

i came across a program called crystaldiscinfo while trying to google the problem

this is my first time trying to install hardware

im not sure what other info to post


edit: just reinstalled completely in UEFI mode. before any drivers or anything has been installed it is taking 20 seconds to boot to a completely settled windows....this seems like it should be way faster i think? is it time to make a call to the retailer i ordered it from?

About two weeks ago I built my own PC (specs below). It was running really well and I didn't have any trouble with it until about two days ago

* Chrome always displaying the ""Oh Snap!"" page
* Internet Explorer having the ""Internet Explorer is not working... trying to find a solution"" dialogue box pop up all the time
* Windows update failing to be able to update (even though I was connected to the internet)
* Microsoft Security Essentials failing to update, and that it needed to be restarted
* Steam telling me that its installation had failed
* Sometimes getting the black boot screen that says ""a recent hardware or software change might have installed a file that is signed incorrectly or damaged

It seemed to me to be a virus, and a common suggestion was run Windows in safe mode with networking, and install Malwarebytes from another computer on to it and run a scan. When I tried scanning the first time, I downloaded the new database for Malwarebytes and ran a scan. It didn't come up with anything, and I closed it. I decided to open it again to run another one (just to double check), and it told me that the database was missing/corrupt, even though I had just downloaded it before. I downloaded it again anyways, and it didn't find anything.

I was getting fed up with it, I ran it once, and left while it was running. I came back, and all that was on the screen was ""Segmentation Fault"". I wasn't sure whether this was supposed to happen, since I've never run it before, so I went ahead and installed Windows. The installation didn't go that smoothly, I got a few black error screens (the same ones as earlier), but eventually I got I made it to the desktop. Well, I went through the installation process, when I ran it

The only things I can think of are that I messed something up,7400.html) happened. Those are the only things that can explain the same things happening over and over again after 3 drive wipes.

The machine doesn't make any beeping noises. The fan starts on both the MB and GPU. After some restarts and switching between different USB ports the mouse lighted up. 

My guess is that there is something wrong with the motherboard. The computer has been powered on almost 24/7 for at least 7 years. 

The GPU has since been upgraded to a nVidia 8800GT 512MB and we've never had any problems with it earlier. 

Maybe try the ""motherboard in the oven""-trick we've all read about as a last resort?

Were stuck and hoped some of you might be able to help us? Moneys tight so we really don't want to buy a new one. 

Thank you!

1338988408.0,unvqk,Alternatives to remote access? (X-post from Tech Support),metalbladex4,5,0,6,"I work as an IT sysadmin for an office branch at the helpdesk. The networking team who oversees the whole division pretty much has complete control of the many operations within our division. My team of 4 people is in charge of about 150 computers using Windows 7. We perform upgrades for programs/OS

Working against us at the helpdesk we do not have remote access is this consumes my office with work. Along with that is I am the only one with sysadmin rights. I use a smartcard to log my sysadmin account so everytime I can only help one person at a time at one location. My other techs have to use local administrator accounts but this can be time consuming since they have to turn off scforceoption in the registry. But even when they use the local admin account they don;t have access to their tools on the network drive even further delaying their work. The registry gets updated by the group policy after it restarts so it has proven secure. My techs are working on getting their sysadmin smartcards but that could be a 12 month process.

One thing I wish we had was remote access so sysadmins in our team could troubleshoot or set up things for the users like email on outlook

I know the networking team uses DameWare. I have asked for it from the networking team but they said it's not authorized to be given to helpdesk teams because they don't have enough keys for the program to install at all helpdesks in the division.

The OS images that we install on the computers we get from the networking team are hardened so I don't think we can activate remote access on the computer's OS and are scanned for unauthorized programs deemed by the corporation's head networking team and the network is also monitored. The new computers that get added to the AD get scanned before they are accepted.

Does anyone have any advice for me so I can overcome these challenges in a similar manner remote administrator would be able to lighten out workload? Maybe a program that cannot be tracked by the networking team or a workflow that someone has mastered?

Thank you

TL;DR: I am asking for help finding solutions to lack of remote administration access and lightening our workload.

In the comments

The ASUS is having the same problems as the Cisco! I don't know why it's doing it. Here is what happens: I start surfing the web on my MacBook Air, it will timeout. I have to reboot the router several times before I can start using. Usually it takes me 5-15 minutes to get me back online. 

Some notes:

* This does not happen while doing hardline connections. The only devices hardlined are the XBoxes.

* I don't have to be doing anything on the MacBook Air in order for it to disconnect. I simply had Google Maps up to check traffic. Came back 10 minutes later to refresh and I was disconnected.

* When it disconnects, the router would actually drop the connection entirely. I can not ping the ASUS RT-N56U even if it says I am connected initially after dropping. 

I have suspected the issues lies within my MacBook Air because it only seems to do it when I use it. However, I am having difficulties coming up with theories as to why two highly rated dual-band routers will not function properly. 

EDIT: Running wired right now and constantly pinging google so I know when the connection drops. I did have to reboot the router in order for it lease out an IP. Will update. Also of note

EDIT 2: 

* As soon I enter my bedroom

* I took my CISCO e4200 and hooked it up in my bedroom using an IP of 192.168.2.1, didn't work for me at all. Oh well.

Thanks to all for your help! Hopefully this setup will work for me.

As far as I know, I don't think that would be the problem.

The thing is, all the ports are listed as closed except for HTTP (80) and one other one I don't remember specifically. If the firewall is turned on, though, they're all listed as stealth, but I still can't connect to them. Enabling DMZ also has no success.

Forgive me it is my first post here in /r/24hoursupport if i make any outstanding mistakes. I wish to confirm if I have come across malware that prevents Ctrl Alt Del functionality to bring up the Windows Security menu and ultimately the Task Manager in Windows 7 with a fully functioning keyboard

-Symptoms:

Windows Security Menu (That screen with the options to log off/task manager/lock computer/etc) does not result after pressing in union Ctrl Alt Del.

-Cure:

After ensuring that the keyboard was not defective
used a macro recording program to macro the Ctrl Alt Del sequence to a single button that didnt involve the Ctrl Alt Del keys. I successfully arrived at the Windows Security menu!!
After trying the keybind again

Pressing Ctrl Alt Del now works fine and normally. I am concerned because malwarebytes and other scanners didn't find anything. And I find it odd that there would be a video error at the same time. Am I overstressing or have I found something that I should report? I could not find the ""process (4) it was referring to.

* First some background: I'm competent with computers and technology in general, but I'm trying all my options anyway).The problem with that is, I don't really have the ability to test the parts individually: I don't have another computer that would be compatible with any of my parts. I live in a pretty small Tennessee town so don't I have any friends who have compatible parts. Not only that, but the only tech store in the area is run by an asshole who is worse than BestBuy with customers. He either is a greedy asshole and lies about computer parts/equipment or he is genuinely terrible with computers but thinks he does and treats everyone else like they don't know shit because of it (I think it's both).

MSI X58 Pro-E LGA Motherboard
CoolMax CUQ-1200B 1200W PSU
EVGA 285 GTX Classified


So this all started in October (~the 16th) when I was playing Metro 2033. Had it on max settings, and it froze. Had to pull the plug on my computer to get it to turn off. It wouldn't start again. Nothing happened, no lights or anything. At the time, I thought it was the power supply. I also had another EVGA 285x (not the classified version) that I didn't have in the computer at the time and used it throughout because I know it worked beforehand.

* Got new power supply from CoolMax (replaced free)

* Tried to get my motherboard replaced by MSI. Wouldn't give me a new one because of ""physical damage.""

* Got a new motherboard (EVGA x58 SLI3)

* Got my CPU replace for a new one by Intel. No change.

I waited to change RAM (even though I thought it was the problem)

* Bought Corsair Gold 1200W PSU because I don't trust CoolMax. No change.

* Bought (got it today) G.Skill Ripjaw 2 x 2GB DDR3 1600. No change.

Some more info:

* Each time I got/replaced a part I tested the parts outside and inside the computer case to make sure there were no shorts being caused by it.

* Multiple tests each time

So, and a harddrive isn't required to POST anyway.

No idea what the problem is now; I'm going to try and get each part tested individually (I don't really know how I'm going to

**EDIT: The source of the problem has been identified


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My three-year old gaming computer is having some hardware-level problem that I cannot make sense of. Usually I can diagnose/fix myself

------------Symptoms-------------

Symptoms occur from the start. Sometimes it won't POST. No video ever gets through (but my monitor detects that there is a signal)

Sometimes it will get through POST, I can press F1 and continue to Windows. Once I'm in Windows all is fine for a while. I managed to play a game for fifteen minutes before it all froze up (I could still hear environmental noise from the game, but video froze, my G15 screen froze [which I'm sure indicates that the software running in the background in Windows is frozen], and none of the usual keyboard commands worked [ctrl+alt+del, Alt+tab, windows key])

Recently I have had problems with my keyboards working at all (PS/2 and USB) (never managing to get to Windows when this happened). Sometimes I can get far enough to hit Del to get into the BIOS, numlock, scrollock), but nothing further. My USB keyboard (G15) never works until Windows.


----------------History--------------

A little over a week ago my PSU failed (500-watt Ultra X-Finity). Before the ultimate failure

The PSU I had before supposedly had measures to prevent itself from killing the motherboard/CPU/anything else when it died. When it did go out, so I don't know if that is a problem.


-------------Further thoughts----------

The PSU is supposedly an upgrade because Ultra didn't carry my old PSU anymore

The RAM isn't an issue

The soundcard probably isn't the issue either. As I said earlier

Overheating is not an issue either. My CPU hasn't been put through nearly as much hurt recently as it has, and when Windows froze today, I happened to have the G15 on the GPU temp page, and it was well within the healthy zone. I also checked the CPU temp every time I went into the BIOS, and it was always in the green for a start up. Plus, if the CPU was overheating, the system would straight-up shut off. It was an issue three years ago

I don't think the CPU is the problem because of the many hours of gaming last night and the fifteen minutes today. 

The video card likely isn't an issue either for the same reasons as above. No artifacts last night or today.

The optical drive isn't causing an issue

I doubt the HDD is an issue either for the same reasons as the video card and CPU.

That about brings it all down to the motherboard. I don't have anything to rule it out

I have cleared CMOS half a dozen times today. No BIOS setting is causing this issue.

--------------------------------------------------------------

That is all I have to say. Congratulations for reading all of that, I'll let you know how it goes once I'm done. Thank you for any help you can give, I've exhausted all of my ideas. I'll put some specs down below for you.

Can I get a little help in this mug?

My old Asus A3H has a battery that will, so I'm looking to get a replacement. However the options are kind of dumbfounding me. 

There seem to be three options here:

*  Get a ""genuine"" replacement which specs out to 14.8V

*  Get a battery with the appropriate specs to the original costing about $90 and are offered at those sponsored links on google like battdepot.com

*  Get one on ebay from sellers out of HK selling the same spec'd battery for $40. I almost trust these guys more than the ""Ill-sell-you-a-battery-quick.com"" guys.

Of note, and that was with new cells. 

So how should I proceed? Do any of you have good sources online for batteries? What's the deal with the cheaper ones

   My Xbox has always been temperamental on the network (it was a miracle to not be kicked from parties every half hour) and my browser periodically showed ""No dsl signal detected, only after an hour of running ""test connection,"" failing at different steps and for different reasons, will my Xbox maybe connect to live for a few hours. 

   ATT has come out twice, read forums for help etc, and some of them had slightly helped or hindered, but none fixed. The interesting thing is, certain settings changes seem to fix it temporarily, before my internet reverts back to its original shittyness. 
   

   For example, the xbox connection has slowly degraded into nothing. In the first while after this change as well as a few others the Xbox connection was ok, periodic drops but ok overall. Now it will almost not connect period. 

  A bit more background info, a mac, and an iphone, with others devices coming and going. The Xbox is a first gen with a wireless adaptor. 

I think that's about it, my computer area is slowly being destroyed as I break things in the Internets periodic absences.

""Grand Theft Auto IV: Episodes from Liberty City has stopped working""


Initially, ran CCleaner, and reinstalled. This did not work. I am 99.9% sure that this a GFWL issue because I also this tested Microsoft Flight. It was able to start up (i made it to the start screen), but when it came time to load GFWL, it crashed, giving me the same error as EFLC. 


I have googled this problem extensively and have tried every solution that I could find. I have tried running GFWL as an admin in compatibility mode


Because I have read many threads about how GFWL and Win8 just won't cooperate, there must be a way to remedy this. Also, for what it's worth, I also had a similar problem with Fable: The Lost Chapters. I was able to start and play the game initially, but now it won't even load either (even after a fresh reinstall). I'm rather stumped by this, so I come to you guys for help. Thanks!



P.S. I'm off to work right now



DxDiag is as follows:

**UPDATE 2: Rebooting the PC didn't work either. It says that I am connected to the router on a peer-to-peer connection with an Excellent signal but I cannot access any webpage whatsoever. I can't even access 192.168.2.1 to access router settings.**

____________________

This is for somebody else I'm helping with PC issues. Here's the problem broken down

**The issue:**

His computer (as of this afternoon) cannot connect wirelessly to the router at all. He is using a Belkin 54g PCI-E wireless network card. I don't know the exact model but it's a good few years old now.

It can detect the networks on the Wireless Utility

**Solutions I have tried:**

* Resetting the router and modem. Didn't work.
* Reconfiguring the utility's settings for our access point
* Repairing the connection via the windows network icon in the system tray. Ends up stuck on 'Connecting to the wireless network' for about two minutes then fails without establishing a connection.
* Restarting the PC. Numerous times.
* Reinstalling the Belkin drivers using the original installation CD

**Operating system:**

Windows XP Service Pack 3.

**Questions:**

1. Should I bin the current card and get a new wireless PCI-e card? Out of all the threads I've tried to search for a solution with
2. Could a virus
3. Should I consider trying to disable the Belkin Wireless Utility and using the built-in Windows utility? [One forum thread suggested the Belkin software was a load of horse shit.](http://www.techspot.com/community/topics/belkin-wireless-g-adapter-problem.70907/)

Basically my computer is unable to detect a system image on my external hard drive. I had previously deleted it to make room for another backup but wasn't able to make a new one (because I deleted the System Reserved partition

I used Recuva, and so the the computer isn't detecting the system image. Also there is no VHD file and so I need to know how/if it's even to restore without a VHD file.

Issue: So for about a month and a half now, and then it will run like everything is normal for about two seconds. This repeats until I turn off the machine.

Temporary Solution: After running tests on every component of my machine, and I've found that resetting the CMOS (by pulling the battery) stops the problem for about two weeks. Now that's the strange part--it's as if something is changing my CMOS settings (or that something becomes more unstable over time). I do not overclock my machine, and I've run stress tests and diagnostics on most of my parts. The problem occurs even when I'm running on the Intel HD 4000 chip (I pulled out my graphics card to test that). Any idea on how I can go about figuring out the issue?

Anyway, the PC emits a long beep and the screen stays black. After waiting a couple of minutes to start it after it crashes, it usually starts ok. 

This has happened maybe 10 times in past 5 days. Before this I had 18 months or so of zero issues. The streams are from [twitch.tv](www.twitch.tv) and the game is League of Legends

Like I said

I am a big gamer and PC user but I've always used Windows 7 mostly because of my games I play - ArmA etc. 

All my friends tell me to dual boot Ubuntu (I loved the UI and the system when I tested it once before) and Windows 7

So is it worth it? I can always remove Ubuntu if I realise that I did not really need it.

So the guys I bought it from got a new lamp and replaced it, retains the green tint.  This leads me to conclude that it's a problem with the LCD element somehow.

The Question is, but it is a rather nice television set aside from this flaw.  Even if it costs a significant amount, I'm just wondering if I can get the part, if that is indeed the problem, and replace it to get a clear picture.  If it's model-specific, it may be a problem, but...  Anyway, since I'm sure I haven't given enough

 I've tried both my battery and my charger in a friends laptop and they worked fine.  As well as his charger and battery.  He has the same model I do.  I've tried putting the old hard drive back in.  I've tried removing the battery, and holding down the power button for 60 seconds.  Then replacing RAM and power plug and trying to power on.

I'm not sure why changing the hard drive has kept it from powering up.  I'm either missing something or something just happened to come loose today.

I have also tried to manually connect to the wifi by typing in the connection name and the password etc. 

still havent got a connection. I dont know what is wrong but I do know my computer wont even let me toggle on and off the wifi switch. its like grayed and faded out and wont let me click it.

So they checked my connection to the modem and they got around 192 Mbps. I had already tried to use different cables

So I re installed the OS one of my computers and ever since then my internet speed is around 100-185 Mbps (I can do one test and get 100Mbps and the next test I get ~180 Mbps) 

So I really do not know what I should try next (Non of my computers use the same Motherboard/dedicated internet card and I have disabled windows firewall just in case that was the problem but no....) And I can transfer data between my computers at 100-110MBps.

So any suggestions on what I should try now?

(I'm using Windows 7 Ultimate 64 and the modem is a Netgear CG3100)

If needed I can post specs of my comps. But they all should be able to handle the speed.

I recently encountered an issue where I cannot get Netflix to work in any browser (Firefox, but as soon as I click ""play"" on the browse videos site, when it loads the Silverlight plug-in, nothing happens.  If I right click the screen at any time, an error message shows up saying that Silverlight has crashed.

I have uninstalled and reinstalled Silverlight, and cleaned up my registry using CCleaner.  I have tried to run Firefox in safe mode, disabling all add-ons.  I have attempted to run an earlier version of Silverlight (but Netflix insisted I upgrade, rendering that attempt useless).  I have also upgraded my video card drivers to the latest version.

I have also attempted to run Netflix through Windows Media Center, as well as both my Android phone and tablet.

Any ideas on how to work through this issue?  I'm all out of troubleshooting ideas.

Thanks for your help

""I'm not sure how to describe this problem, so I don't think it's system specific. The problem is as follows:

I'm running the system with the A/V (Red/White/Yellow) into the front of the PVR. The PVR is plugged in, things run just fine. Aspect ratio is correct, colors come through correctly, and the input is responsive. Once I run the TotalMedia program, AND select the PVR as the source (The problem doesn't occur when the source is my Webcam, for example), the video on the preview will lag behind and be slower, but on the TV, it will change to 4:3 (or close to it), so that the aspect ratio is almost square. It will do this the first time

Once the source is set to something else, but the alteration of the aspect ratio persists. I don't know if this has something to do with the drivers, the capture software, or my TV, or whatever it may be. If anyone could offer any advice, it would be much appreciated. If there are any questions you'd like me to answer, let me know.

After trying a video capture test, and the video remains the same. I assume this is when the issue occurred. Could this have to do with the format of the video signal being less than 1080i? It's running 480i at the moment.""

if you made it through that wall of text, but when I have it as an input device in the capture software, it suddenly starts doing this.  Maybe it's not designed to work for this, but it's supposed to be, and I don't see why if it works to output without going into the software, why it has the problem when it is.  Of course, since the capture is all off, and think we may have bought the wrong box.  It's such a strange issue

When I went to defragment the drive, so I made a backup of the directory on a removeable drive, then deleted it from the local system, freeing up enough space to defrag.

After defragmenting the drive (using the windows native client)

Since the directory fit on the drive previously with 2GB extra room

Steps I have taken to fix:

* 1.  Searched the drive for large temp and hidden files (found none new)
* 2.  Verified no shadowcopy
* 3.  Removed the 'exta' 1Gb allocated to paging file after adding 1Gb of memory
* 4.  Ran Auslogics defrag and optimization 
* 5.  Ran checkdisk

After all of this

Before I removed the dir from the disk originally, so I know the directory itself did not grow.

I am going to suggest upgrading the drive to something larger as a long term solution

Any ideas?

1366830490.0,1d10za,Question about dual WAN,PDshotME,5,0,5,"I am a photographer looking to use a device called CamRanger[1] which allows me to take photos and have the photos display to an iPad or Macbook. Problem is CamRanger works on an ad hoc network so it only displays to one display. My ultimate goal is to make it display on multiple clients' iPads as well as my own so I can see what they see while I am shooting.
Through my own research (through dense tech forums I don't completely understand) I think the best option would be to get my computer connected to a dual WAN router which would allow my computer to stay on the ad hoc CamRanger network as well as connect to a wifi network where I would have multiple options as to how to get the photos out to multiple devices.

Is there any way to sync everything together to where BOTH my phone AND the browser version of Google Music have all of my music and playlists?  If not

Second, is there a way I can keep it from changing?  Or should I just load everything over to the new one and re-arrange and setup my background?

Lastly, should I try moving these back as a precaution?  

Is there anything else I should know/do to keep everything as close to the same as possible?  What would be the exact steps in doing everything?

Hello

First of all I would like to thank all of you for you help

The PSU wasn't the thing that was smoking, Hard Drive and Video card are all fine too.

It seems that I was a fool for buying an ASRock 970 Extreme3 motherboard. Newegg reviews are full of people that have had problems with it.

I managed to get a refund on the motherboard and a RMA on the processor just incase.

To all of you buying parts out there. Be sure to be very through on checking the reviews on parts you're buying. Go as far to search the part name on this subreddit and use metareddit.com to see when it's been mentioned in the comments.

I need help finding a reliable AM3+ motherboard. I would love if it were as cheap as the ASRock 970 but the priority here is reliability. Of course we're avoiding any ASRock motherboards. I would also appreciate if you guys could tell me reliable brands for everything hardware related so I never buy something bad again.

I was playing games last night when all of a sudden my display goes dark and my sound cuts out.  My tower remained on - lights, which has no effect, then holding the power button down, also with no effect.  I had to turn off the power supply to get the thing to shut off.

Turning the system back on, but I've noticed my GPU is not on - at least, the fan isn't running on it.

This initially led me to believe the GPU was busted - since the display cut out in the first place and it won't turn on - but since I get no post and the peripherals won't turn on either

I'm going to try to procure some spare parts to switch in but that's going to take some time.  Any thoughts?

1362823892.0,19yrun,GTX 670 Issues Xpost from r/Techsupport,Delvaris,5,1,4,"GTX 670 stutters or hitches. There is a huge drop in power utilization that coincides with a drop in GPU utilization. It looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/0lVZKch.png). It occurs in any app

System:

* Intel Core i7 3820 @ 4.3 Ghz
* Corsair H110
* 16 gigs of that awesome low profile low voltage samsung ram
* Gigabyte Windforce 2GB 670 OC
* Gigabyte X79-UP4
* Seasonic 850X PSU (850 Watts)

Temps are in the range of 50-60c when playing a game they only reach 70c when running furmark burn in.

What I've done:

The first thing I did was I reverted the force-enable-gen3.exe hack from nVidia. After reading their descriptions of the issues with PCI Express 3.0 and X79 chipsets it sounded like it could be the same issue. So it is running PCI Express 2.0 as expected and as specced. It seemed to possibly help

After performing some research reading that the issue could possibly be with GPU boost aggressively managing the clock

After that did not work -Starting with the 314.14 drivers. I downgraded back to 314.07. I flashed the newest BIOS onto the card

I have the newest BIOS for my motherboard. I've also tried it both open and closed case just in case the VRM was overheating. I also applied a stress test of 1024x768 Furmark AND Prime95 Blend to attempt to push as hard as I could to see if the CPU's voltage was being throttled down as you would expect with an overheating VRM. This was not the case

[This](http://i.imgur.com/G9ZXksr.png) is another screenshot from Far Cry 3 to demonstrate that the issue load independent. After the red line I stood and looked straight down at the ground and stayed that way until the end of the monitoring session. [Here](http://depositfiles.com/files/s2oflpjzg) is an afterburner hardware log from the same session.

This issue exists in all games

As far as I can tell the only things I haven't done is put my actual hands on the hardware itself. What should my next steps be and does anyone have any suggestions? Thank you for your time

Edit: Edited to add this screenshot that implies a possibly cyclical nature to the problem. It was after complete reinstall of 314.07 drivers using driver sweeper in between. My next step is to try an older driver in the 310 range to see if it creates the issue. Though I am worried that losing FC 3 updates from newer optimizations could mess with the results. 

Additionally I have determined that the large spikes are occuring 45 seconds apart

The vertical red line in this picture is when I boarded the hang glider and performed no other actions and just let it coast until it hit the ground. This is on the very high pre-set by the way.

-The entire game lags - audio, interacting with objects and scenery]. This would make the entire game skip for as long as it takes to move the mouse or press a key, then the skipping stops [I can induce the lag by changing weapons very quickly].

-Multiplayer does not lag differently than offline.

-All video and graphics settings are at their lowest. If they were any lower I might as well be playing Goldeneye 64.

I submitted a ticket to Steam Help and posted on the forums. Only the latter gave me any sort of response

I've done everything except for reinstalling Windows and/or wiping and starting fresh [is that even necessary?]. I even went out and bought some compressed air, this machine is half-empty, etc.

Games that I have tried that work on this computer:  
DotA 2  
Torchlight  
tactlessly pirated Starcraft 2 - the game did not work properly but the graphics did!  
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 [I did not test if it worked online/multiplayer
