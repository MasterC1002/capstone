**Care to share some pictures? Do you have before and after pictures?**

I don’t have digitized pictures of me when I was overweight

**What are your current stats? (Age, weight, body fat % method used)**

I’m 35 and a half, Jackson-Pollock 7 point method and visual comparisons).

**What is your story? What sports or athletic activities are you involved in, and why did you get into it?**

I have always struggled with my weight. 

I used to be an overweight kid

During school, reading comic books, etc. Then puberty hit, and you know, girls started to become important, so I decided to start lifting. 

I bought a couple of magazines, went from being overweight to just chubby. I tried to follow the traditional ""bulk up"" diets (lots of carbs, etc.) but probably did everything wrong because I only got fatter and didn't really build muscle. 

Sometime around 2001 I was reading on some forums on the internet and found out about a “Ketogenic Diet”

* [BodyOpus by Dan Duchaine](http://www.amazon.com/Underground-Bodyopus-Militant-WeightRecomposition/dp/0965310701)

* [The Ketogenic Diet by Lyle McDonald](http://www.amazon.com/Ketogenic-Diet-Complete-DieterPractitioner/dp/0967145600/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367373336&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=lyle+mcdonald+ketogenic)

So I started following the diet and training set up by the books, almost twelve years later, talking with the beloved community of /r/ketogains

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and those around you?**

*Live and let live.* If you want to be educated

**What advice do you take

If there is anything I have learned from keto

**How do you motivate yourself? (music

“Do

Also, House, Classic Rock, Heavy Metal, Bubble Gum Pop and right now I’m on my Indie Phase.


**What are your favorite sports/fitness books, or other resources?**

My favorite book is “Arnold’s The New Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding”. 

Also

**Do you have a role model / inspiration, who would it be and why?**

""The Oak"" (Arnold) - Period. Do you even have to ask why?

***DIET AND NUTRITION***

**How did you end up doing a Ketogenic diet?**

I've answered it in “What is your story"" ;)

**Do follow a SKD TKD

I've followed all three: Back when I started keto, but also I found it hard due to the depletion workouts and meal preparing. Then about 2 years ago I started experimenting with TKD and now I do a mix between it and a SKD.

**What does your diet look like?**

I’m a very boring guy

In lieu of not complicating myself, cheese, chicken, tuna, salmon, beef, salads, etc.

**Do you take any supplements? Which ones

- *Preworkout*: VPX Creatine Plasma

- *Postworkout*: Whey protein shakes , Green tea pills – to repair and build muscle

**What are some diet / training related things you hold to be true
It used to be the Ketogenic diet

***TRAINING***



**Do you compete at any level?**

Only against myself!


**What is your workout or training regimen?**

I follow a 5 day split with 1 or 2 days rest. ^[Sample ^shoulder ^and ^ab ^workouts ^can ^be ^found ^in ^darthluiggi's ^post ^history. ^-Ed.]

**What is your training philosophy?**

Just go and do it. Get in

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training that you've never seen others do?**

I suppose it’s nothing new, etc.)

**Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

I like to mix and match training styles

**What injuries have you had to deal with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors? Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

I've had my share of shoulder / arm injuries due to not warming up correctly. Guys

***GOALS***

**What are your current athletic or fitness-related goals?**

I’d like to hit +167 lbs while maintaining my current BF% sometime next year.

**What have you achieved so far? (Body re-composition, etc.)**

I managed to drop my body fat % from 12

**What challenges do you face?**

Trying to balance my macros as to eat enough to sustain muscle and lifts

***OFF-TOPIC***

**What do you do? (For fun

My hobbies range from playing video-games

**You get one superpower

Stop Time. Really

**If your biography became an audiobook

Arnold! Something along like [this.](http://youtu.be/hlxoyw_8I7I)


**FOLLOW UPS**

**Do you train alone

I train alone

**I imagine that this question answers itself

Arnold as a training partner and mentor. I’m not worthy!

**If you could spend a day with anyone, who would it be, and why?**

Again, joking and having an epic meal post workout!


**You've said you only compete against yourself, or surprise us by choosing another category for yourself?**

I agree

**You certainly seem to have competitive potential

I’ve pondered about it

**If you don't mind us asking

I manage a restaurant, doing PR, waiting tables, designing the menu, a little bit of everything. Training keeps me sane and helps me burn the stress out!

    
**And there you have it, question ideas, feedback, and anything other than spam, to kgmemberspotlight.**

why does this happen? 

well

but after a while, and then they rebound. why?

well if you weren't exercising before, it becomes increasingly easier and easier to do so to a point where it becomes effortless.

but you are NOT building new muscle

sure

which brings us back to why you should lift heavy:

there is no practical limit to the amount of muscle you can build. oh, and when you get there, you can lift 400. that's a 33% increase in your limit with the potential to continue to grow. all the while, having more muscle mass means more energy expenditure (whereas fat doesn't need much extra energy to sag off your ass). lifting increasingly heavier means you cannot become more efficient because you are constantly pushing the limits of your body. *with heavy weight training, your energy expenditure only gets larger as you continue to train*.

if you want weight loss, and there is (for all intents and purposes) no plateau to how much you can burn. stay keto and your body will stop storing fat as an energy source and begin to use it to fuel muscle growth.

simple as that.

lift hard. lift heavy. stop when you see the results you want.

you might even find that you want to continue getting bigger when you get there.

***""I'm lifting, gaining weight! What am I doing wrong?! How do I fix this!?""***

Now

 Why are you weighing yourself?

 The scale is a highly specialized tool

The scale can't tell you about the quality of the mass, how, or why.

Granted virtually every household and gym has one

The answer is a resounding **sometimes**.

I'm willing to bet the disclosure of my throwaway account that the majority of us here in ketogains, of us phrased it as ""lose weight.""

Well

 Are you a competitive athlete who needs to make weight for an event? The scale is your friend.

Are you trying to lose pounds (or kilos) so that you can safely skydive? The scale is your friend.

Are you trying to lose weight because your doctor has said ""You need to lose 20 pounds

 Are you into bodybuilding? Not the step on stage in a thong and pose kind

Are you just trying to get strong

 It's time we stop treating the scale as the arbiter of progress. Here in ketogains it is a mere lesser member of our progress tracking pantheon. The loud younger brother of the mirror and of the improvements in your training. The lazy twin of the humble measuring tape. The lackluster parent of bodyfat analysis.

Set your goals with forethought, find a feat you want to accomplish, select a sport at which you want to excel. Set your focus on that, and off the scale, and I promise you that even if you don't lose net mass the world will think you have.",,False,t5_2v5mu,True

1373392138.0,1hy500,[RANT]Some observations and rants from my months of gaining.,AnalLeak,41,4,25,"Male here. Been doing starting strength since about mid April.
Here are some observations and ramblings. Take it as what you will.



**Supplements:**


Citruline Malate probably doesn't do anything except quench my thirst at the gym. Nice and sour!

Don't take coffee+heavy cream + beta alanine at the same time. It will probably mess up your stomach.

Beta alanine rocks. At first I didn't believe
I thought Glutamine was BS. It seems to work for me very

But Glutamine is expensive. Damn.

Creatine doesn't seem to do much for me. When I was loading on it

I still take Creatine.

Taurine is best at night. Stay away from beta alanine if taking taurine during the day.

Multivitamins are made of highlighter fluid.

ZMA works very very very well for me. Dosage is 3 pills before bed. I take 4. Fuck the police.

Gonna buy Potassium Chloride soon.



**Diet:**


SKD was fine for about a month until I started getting VERY weak before the gym. Tried coconut oil but it did nothing. I carbed up one night on Sunday and felt like an Ox in the morning.

I do a post workout dextrose load. Sometimes it makes me nauseous.

It's easy to not get enough fat. Make Fat Bombs.

Avocado is great but expensive. Well worth it.

Making bacon everyday gets the stove very messy.

I've lost 18 lbs doing SKD

Weight fluctuates a lot.

The white chocolate ON shake is a great alternative to the double chocolate flavor.

Be sure to get enough veggies. nothing but meat will tear you up.

Carb cravings still exist but I ignore them. Maybe I'll do a carb up soon.




**Workout related:**


Rest days are rest days. I can't seem to do any HIIT on rest days.

I feel fat still even though I feel somewhat stronger.

My calves actually have gotten bigger doing SS. Yes it can happen!

My bench press sucks. I had it almost fall on me once but some random dude saved my neck.

But my squat is getting deadly...

Do different types of squats on different days. Don't always go for max weight. FEEL the muscles being used. Do low weights

Don't use your knees while squatting. It will jack you up. Proper form is key.

I see people doing high weight squats and barely forming a 45 degree angle with their legs. I am superior.

Some women are strong as hell at my gym. 235 deadlifts from a chick 5'4""?

Deadlifts are my favorite exercise.

I try to deadlift my dog but I keep touching his wee wee. Gross.

Friggin power cleans are very tough. I still don't think I'm doing them right.

Knees get banged up from improper clean/deadlift form. Watch it.

Wholy crap my neck/shoulder muscles have gotten huge. I had nothing!

Also

Bicep muscles are not huge. SS don't give no shit about biceps.

Neck pains have subsided from lifting.

My moobs are starting to fill out.

I still get DOMS if I worked out properly.

ALWAYS

Afternoon workouts are the best time energy-wise. Too bad the gym is a lot more packed.

I helped some young stick with his proper form at the gym. He's gonna make it.

My grip is a lot stronger. You know those guys that shake your hands too strong for no fucking reason? I will grip those assholes back until they cry.

Put the weights you're going to use right next to you if you're doing any sort of pyramid exercise. People take the 2.5 and 5lb weights all the time.

A Mouthguard is a very cheap investment and helped me gain on the deadlift and squat.

I see dude's bodies now (no homo) and can tell that a good half of them are focused solely on their arms.



**Random:**


I'm getting mired a lot more.

..And people pay attention to me more and stop bumping into me like jerks even though I'm a tall dude.

I'm kinda physically tired all the time still. I need a lot of sleep.

Nobody really supports me in my quest to get fit as fuck

I still drink a lot of alcohol. Vodka

My mood has somewhat stabilized.

Tanning a bit makes me look stronger.

To have somewhat visible abs

1373999762.0,1ifhww,community round-table: let's get clear on losing fat,semiotix,38,9,42,"i see that there are differing opinions on how to lose fat in this sub-reddit. all of us that are on ketogenic diets should know that nutrition science has clearly been wrong on their assumptions and have even called keto ""dangerous"" and ""life-threatening"". because of this

that said

let's start with assumptions - these are the bases upon which the discussion will take place:

1) keto (reducing carbohydrates to a negligible dietary amount) causes weight loss in people - in both people who are already highly active and people who are sedentary (see /r/keto /r/ketogains)

2) it is scientific fat that insulin triggers responses in your body to both store more fat and to stop using fat as a source of energy (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin#Physiological_effects)

3) glycogen is the preferred energy source for the human body (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen)

&gt; When present in sufficient quantities
 
4) the human body stores up to approximately 500 grams of glycogen in the body (see: http://www.extension.iastate.edu/humansciences/content/carbohydrate)

what this foundation tells me are these several things:

* fat loss on keto is predominantly done through the use of stored energy through robbing the body of glycogen as its preferred energy source

* insulin, store body fat, and stop using fat as an energy. 

* then it is sufficient to say that the significant portion of fat loss comes from the lack of carbohydrates which leads to your body burning fat for its energy source.

* furthermore

what am i proposing? calories-in, then we must simply reject the notion that counting calories and eating carbs is as efficient at weight-loss as rejecting carbohydrates - **assuming that caloric remains the same**

this is not to say calorie consumption doesn't effect your body mass. if you have excess energy

Yes, but this will make it hard to lose weight due to glycogen reserves stored in your body - because your energy expenditure must exceed 2000 STORED calories (see 4) in addition to what you are eating that day (another 1500-2000) to even scratch the surface of fat loss. if these muscle glycogen reserves are NOT depleted, then every extra calorie gets converted into stored fat. *In addition: insulin is signaling your body to store more fat and burn less of it!*

The alternative is to eat your BMR (or less), so that all your energy expenditure comes from the food you eat. when your expenditure EXCEEDS that of the food you eat, the energy MUST come from fat deposits.  **THIS IS HOW YOU LOSE FAT**.

**EDIT: KETO = EMPTY GLYCOGEN RESERVES**

**TL;DR**

* if you eat carbs regularly
* in addition: insulin is telling your body to stop burning fat and to store more
* if you reject carbs
* you have to burn through muscle glycogen reserves before you burn fat
* this is why macros matter - in this regard

**TL;DR2** WITH SIMPLIFIED ANALOGY!

let's say your body has one high-performance small battery and one

the small capacity battery is your glycogen levels,,False,self,t5_2v5mu,1374039221.0,,True

I am pretty okay at lifting weights, and I do neuroscience research. I hope to become an active member of /r/ketogains and help it grow. Here is a summary of my stats, diet and training plan:

**Stats:**

* 26 year old male
* 5' 8""
* Intermediate weight trainer who hates cardio unless said cardio is hiking or playing a sport. I train for strength first
* Here's a [current picture](http://i.imgur.com/4CpmNPi.jpg) at roughly 18% body fat.

1RMs:

* Deadlift: 375
* Squat: 325
* Bench press: 225
* Overhead press: 135

**Diet:**

I will be doing a fairly standard CKD with a 24-36 hour carb refeed each weekend. Though I said I train for strength first

The perhaps unconventional aspect of my diet is that I intermittently fast. A lot. I eat one meal a day five days per week (ketogenic style), 16/8 one day, and 47/1 on on occasion. I do all weight training fasted, occasionally supplementing with BCAAs.

**Training:**

I train four days per week

*Monday*

* Deadlift (3 sets
* Barbell row (3 sets
* Hamstring curls (3 sets

*Wednesday*

* Bench press (3 sets
* Incline DB press (3 sets
* Overhead triceps press (3 sets

*Friday*

* Squat (3 sets
* Calf raises (3 sets

*Saturday*

* Overhead press (3 sets
* Weighted chins (3 sets
* Side bend
* Ab rollouts

On off days I do grip training and sometimes take walks but I'm not really very active apart from my weight training. Oh

**Background and Goals**

So I had been an ardent follower of leangains for years, and [how to cure fuckarounditis](http://www.leangains.com/2011/09/fuckarounditis.html). The bad part was that I became obsessed with getting ""enough"" food. Rather than listening to my body and adhering to a modest, sustainable plan I was always buying food I didn't want (carbs) and trying to stuff huge amounts of food down my throat. That, and I hate packing lunches. Leangains may work for others, but it doesn't work for me.

So in May I discovered the Steak and Eggs diet through the Mark's Daily Apple forum. It's basically CKD, butter, and heavy cream 6 days per week. I adopted it for 3.5 weeks, loved it, lost fat, improved my reflection and increased strength. Then, for some reason, cows, and fruit. I'll also eat fish

Have any suggestions? Does anyone else fast as much as I do? Are there any other leangains refugees around?

**7/2 EDIT:** I'd like to mention that I find stretching and mobility to be very important to a successful strength training program.

Hello my fellow Ketoers and sub trolls


I haven't posted in a long while. But I thought today would be a good day to post something. (Didn't even post for my century mark) Back on June 18th I started Keto at the advisement of my Doctor's office. In the 10 1/2 months since then I have had good times and bad. Things have been slow lately
In that time I have lost 107 lbs. From 353 down to 246. Today I capped off what I have done so far by doing a half marathon here in Oklahoma City. Was originally going to do a 5k

Note: Ran the race in keto. Now in the midst of a day and a half keto break. Tuesday I go back onto super strict keto to get rid of my last 47lbs I want to lose and start training for the Half Marathon at Disneyland. Wish me luck.

Note+: That last picture. The cheeseburger was the greatest cheeseburger I've ever had. Not sure if it was the not having one for 10.5 months

tl;dr: Lost 107lbs




- Ran the entire thing in Keto

I carried two 100 calorie packs of Emerald Almonds with me. The Dry roasted ones for more salt content. These helped me get through the early and mid stages.

I drank two swigs of powerade at the last few miles. By this point I had hit major cramp issues and was just trying to hold it together. This is more to do with lack of training than substance choice in my opinion.   This was sort of a test half marathon to see if I could physically finish the one I have planned in September. 

The night before I ate a dinner of hamburger meat with a low carb marinara sauce. Breakfast was some chicken and cheese about 1.5 hrs before the race.


Any advice for me going forward? Today was about finishing. Next time is about time. ",self,t5_2v5mu,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/1dasyy/10_12_months_of_keto_107lbs_and_a_half_marathon/

We are very excited to announce that we are going to follow in the footsteps of some of the other fitness related subreddits and begin posting Member Spotlights!

At present we are planning to post one Spotlight per month

***What is a Member Spotlight?!***

A Member Spotlight serves two purposes. At face value they are similar to AMA threads, drop in to see what's going on in the thread about them and answer questions, but it is not a place to come ask ""Would you rather eat a horse sized duck, or fifty duck sized horses?"" The other is that a number of the questions will be front-loaded into the original post. Going by the Member Spotlights of other subreddits we have assembled something of a starter list but if any questions are showing up consistently in the threads, or you PM ideas, they may be made standard questions.

The other is to recognize members of ketogains who have been consistent contributors

To reflect this second purpose we are going to ask you

***What happens if I nominate someone for a spotlight?***

If a member of ketogains is nominated for a spotlight, it'll be great!""

Second

When the nominee accepts, the Spotlight thread is posted at the scheduled time.

***Can I nominate myself?***

We would prefer that you not nominate yourself

Good: ""I'm going to State next month!""

Not so good: ""I just squatted 315lbs for 20 reps for the first time!""

Use your judgement

***I want to nominate someone

By all means, they should at least get a warm fuzzy feeling that someone nominated them.

***I nominated one person

One of two things happened. Either your nominee declined

***What will you do if you run out of nominees?***

Hopefully this won't happen

Potential resolutions include:

- More time between spotlights

- Mod spotlights

- No more spotlights

Our first spotlight will be happening May 1st, who has been gracious enough to be the guinea pig for this whole process.

If you have any questions about spotlights

***GENERAL ABOUT***

**Care to share some pictures? Do you have any before and afters?**

I’m shy ☺. Give me a few more weeks/months of keto and I’ll share some.

**What are your current stats? (Age, weight, body fat percentage and method used)**

I’ll be 32 next month, about 165 and 12-13% BF using accumeasure calipers. The problem with being Asian is that we tend to store all our body fat around the midsection – so I look close to 20% with the shirt off. First world keto problems, right?

**What is your story? What sports or athletic activities are you involved in

I’ve never been coordinated or good at sports as a kid. I was always one of the last to be picked playing schoolyard sports. One of my best childhood memories was playing dodgeball – there was this kid Tony who was always very athletic. He threw one of his heaters and I caught it and all the kids went “ooooooh.” 

When I got into my 20s, but I would never drop any weight and it was maddening. I discovered keto and I probably came down 10 lbs of body fat in a few months. It was life changing.

Now I’m rock climbing and doing yoga pretty regularly. I added weight-lifting back into my regimen and I’m doing the Texas Method. My goal by the end of the month is to hit a 350 deadlift.


**How do you deal with naysayers

You know, but there are a lot of people who are stuck in the older ways of thinking. They all say fat is bad for me and that I’ll have a heart attack eating all these eggs and bacon. 

But


**What advice do you take

Experiment on your own body – you are like no one else on this planet. There’s a lot of false information out there and a lot of people live their lives according to rules written by others for others. Figure out what works for you and do it.

**How do you motivate yourself? (Music

I’m a huge self-help junkie – I recommend everyone always question their standing beliefs in an effort to improve themselves. Don’t let others dictate what improvement is for you.


**What are your favorite sports/fitness books, or other resources?**

-

**Do you have a role model/inspiration? Anyone you would like to train with or compete against? Who

I want to train with this guy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHiKDa4ip_Q


***DIET AND NUTRITION***

**How did you end up following a Ketogenic diet?**

I read Tim Ferriss 4 Hour Body. It was crap (for me). I read somewhere that insulin was the enemy of weight loss and ended up on /r/keto - and the reason I joined reddit.

**Do you follow a Standard

I try to do SKD as much as possible. Right now, so I have a kind of on-and-off relationship with it right now.

**What does your diet look like?**

Beef, eggs, mayonnaise and whiskey – a little bit of trouble getting enough veggies into my diet, but for now, I’m ok with fiber supplements.

**Do you take and supplements? Which? What do they do for you?**

Not much except protein shakes on workout days. Instead of water

**What are some diet related ideas that you hold to be true

I think cardio is a myth for weight loss.

***Training***

**Do you compete at any level?**

Yoga


**What is your training plan?**

MWF – Texas method. I also do yoga and rock climb on these days

**What is your training philosophy?**

Lift hard

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training from others you see or hear about?**

Lifting and yoga simultaneously – a lot of people think these exercises are polar opposites. I think contraction (lifting) and expansion (yoga) are completely complementary for strength.


**What injuries or other setbacks have you had to deal with? What are the risks that come with your athletic endeavors? Any advice on how to deal with them?**


I’ve been fortunate enough to never get seriously injured. But I do recommend a dyna-flex ball to everyone to work stabilizer muscles in your forearms


***OFF-TOPIC***

**What do you do? (Fun

My favorite hobby is precisely the opposite of keto – baking. I can bake you one hell of a sourdough loaf. I also cook a lot. I bought a sous-vide machine a few months ago and as god as my witness


**You get one superpower. Which one

If comics have taught me anything

**If your biography became an audiobook

Dave Chappelle

**If you could spend a day with anyone, who would it be and why?**

Winston Churchill. Now that was a man.

1358273052.0,16mnzl,PSA : Classic Keto Macros don't strictly apply to Ketogains,darthluiggi,25,3,40,"Hi all

Just a quick post

Classic keto macros don't apply if you are aiming to build muscle.

Use the ketogains calculator on the useful links at the sidebar and adjust your goals there.

* If you are aiming to maintain current muscle

* If you want to build muscle

Then just adjust fat ratio to meet your daily calorie goals.

If you have any questions

PS - Edited: protein ratios for men and women are roughly the same - http://forum.simplyshredded.com/topic/6275/protein-needs-men-vs-women/",self,t5_2v5mu,1368318412.0,,cust iebro,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/16mnzl/psa_classic_keto_macros_dont_strictly_apply_to/

**Care to share some pictures? Do you have any before and afters?**

As much as I'd like to, though.

**What are your current stats? (Age, weight, body fat percentage and method used)**

26 years old, and Darthluiggi estimated me around 18-20% iirc.

**What is your story? What sports or athletic activities are you involved in

Besides lifting? I just try to make life itself into an athletic activity. Not in an extreme way, I suppose I could be colored with the ""powerlifter"" or ""strongman"" brush, with a bit of dabbling into the bodybuilding end of the spectrum.

**How do you deal with naysayers

I don't.

In all seriousness, and his argument was ""If you keep eating like that you're going to die. Like, later this month."" - He honestly thought that was the case, and that was a few years ago, so I suppose I dealt with him by not dying?

**What advice do you take

It's a gut check, though. Say some guy who's historically had small and weak arms comes in after a few years with 22"" biceps, starts curling 200lbs with good form, and gives out his secret, I'm much more likely to listen to that than the same guy coming in and curling little pink dumbbells. The main thing though is to never blindly follow advice. Even this advice which I'm giving you now.

**How do you motivate yourself? (Music

Set a goal, but most of the time just having a goal gives me the motivation I need.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books, or other resources?**

Arnold's New Modern Encyclopedia of Bodybuilding, and exrx is handy for some quick reference charts.

***DIET AND NUTRITION***

**How did you end up following a ketogenic diet?**

I didn't even know what a ketogenic diet was, and dead set on joining the Army. I walked into the recruiting office, and thankfully I live in an area with a low incidence of walk-ins, where the recruiter establishes my level of motivation, and decides that he's going to work with me until I can get in. All he said about diet was ""No carbs."" I said ""Does meat have carbs?"" He said ""No."" and I was sold. - Coming from this background, my style of keto dieting is very different from all of you who've read these fancy books on it.

**Do you follow a Standard

Probably best described as a rotating CKD - I go mad if I try to maintain any sort of keto for more than two or three months

**What does your diet look like?**

Piles of meat. The old favorites are chicken breast with mustard, and lettuce-wrapped burgers. All served with broccoli/cauliflower.

""But... But how do you get enough fat? Doesn't your protein get too high eating like that?"" I imagine at least one hypothetical reader is thinking to themself. Honestly? IDGAF. I've had days where my consumption was nearly 100% protein without breaking ketosis

**Do you take any supplements? Which? What do they do for you?**

Oh man, Krill Oil, ZMA, with the odd fat burner (Hey, they go on clearance sometimes.), green tea/EGCG, or ""I'm going to try this!"" bit

**What are some diet related ideas that you hold to be true

If you focus only on making sure that you get enough protein in per day

***Training***

**Do you compete at any level?**

Presently, let's see who can do more!"" I had my sights set on a powerlifting competition later this year, but then started doing construction work which has put a dampner on my training schedule.

**What is your training plan?**

Lift shit with the muscles that feel like lifting today.

**What is your training philosophy?**

""It doesn't count until it hurts.""

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training from others you see or hear about?**

I don't set aside time for stretching, I deadlift 4 times a week during strength cycles, I deadlift and squat on the same day... I could go on.

**What injuries or other setbacks have you had to deal with? What are the risks that come with your athletic endeavors? Any advice on how to deal with them?**

A few years ago I dislocated some rib heads while I was cleaning a dumbbell to military press. That has sadly left me with compromised shoulder integrity

More times than I care to think about I've incurred minor soft tissue injuries to my posterior chain (back, those are usually dealt with by either training through it, or taking time off, with liberal applications of ice.

I once bruised my nipple doing push-ups...

As far as dealing with injuries... First off, get professional assistance. When a professional says to take time off, do it. When your gut says to take time off, do it. Keep some protective gear on hand (For lifting that might be wraps, tape, or a brace) for those days when an old injury is starting to talk to you again.

***OFF-TOPIC***

**What do you do?** (Fun

I'm doing construction work right now, so I suppose you could still say that I work out for a living.

For fun, occasionally volunteer as a roadie, go hiking, and take things apart.

**You get one superpower. Which one

That is a tough one. I kind of feel like having a superpower would just make things too easy, but he's Aquaman, so it should only count as one. ;D

**If your biography became an audiobook

Patrick Stewart.

So, I had a question that's sprung out of my own research and curiousity.

According to both Atkins and the Drs Eades (of Protein Power fame), yet no actual weight loss. She had attempted low-carb and massively overdid it on calories, then complained to her doctor, Michael Eades, that she wasn't LOSING weight, but he observed she wasn't GAINING it either. His suggestion if I remember correctly was that her NEPA (Non-Exercise Physical Activity; I believe that was the term- activities that are largely done subconsciously and output energy, such as shifting, leg-wobbling

HOWEVER, with and without cheat-days (so I guess that makes it an intermittent CKD?) so I'm not worried at all in that regard in terms of planning or execution. I highly doubt I'll ever accidentally overeat on an SKD due to its innate satiety, but in my paranoid little mind I'm curious about the possible outcome, as losing weight so rapidly has been such an arduous process, I'd cry little baby bitch tears if I put on 10 kilos trying to get my lifts back. The very act of ketobulking means excessive calories, whilst maintaining ketosis. So, do ketobulkers gain fat-mass? Is that even possible? If it is

Cheers for the insight, I've really enjoyed lurking and learning here.

TL;DR: Do ketobulkers gain fat if under ketogenic threshold of carbs (ie 50 grams/day roughly)? If so, cool?

Edit: And if our handsome mods are feeling generous and wish to give me advice for my upcoming program (not that I'm necessarily asking) my stats are as follows: 6'1 (185-187 cm, lifting on-and-off for about 8 years, this time on for about 6 months using primarily powerlifting programs (I believe to begin with I did SS, may have tried 5/3/1 and then went with Barry Ross' 3/5 program [aka Tim Ferriss' 'Effortless Superhuman' from The 4 Hour Body]).

Apologies for the low res: the original image was a webcam image

Eating keto since September 2012. Weight dropped off super fast for a couple of months, incidentally, and totally worth going through readaptation. 

I started losing weight again in January, and started lifting... and oh my god, the fat just fell off me. Not much weight change - probably 5-6kg since the start of the year - but I'm down to 22% body fat, and I am so much stronger!

Started out eating about 1200 cal/day, so I aim for about 1600 on non-workout days and more like 1900-2000 on gym days. More if I'm hungry, especially if I've done weights and cardio on the same day. If I eat less, I'm tired and lethargic, so I figure I'll just listen to my body on that one.

I feel great. And it's only going to get better from here. My body goals now are more about body fat and strength - I don't care what I weigh any more. I'd like to get down to about 20% body fat,True,nsfw,t5_2v5mu,False,,,t3_1ag16j

* **Pork rinds/crackling** – Tasty, trace carbohydrates and a protein:fat ratio that is almost perfect keto. Highly satiating due to this. **430 calories per 70g bag – One bag a day max due to satiety.**

* **Protein Shake Cocktail** – Whey protein, heavy cream and coconut oil. Basically a protein/fat bomb that'll probably run in at around 3-400 calories for the whole shake.

Now that the pain and bothers have subdued i have decided its a good time to reevaluate my macros on the calculator and i think it would be wise to ask for some help so i dont shoot myself in the foot.

[This is me as of today at 179.6 lbs (81.5 kg) 5'11"" (178cm) 32years old.](http://imgur.com/a/3wMm0#0) 

I havent really exercised for most of my life and have lost like 70 pounds on keto in the last 6 months.

I put myself at roughly 22% BF (maybe more?) although my scale swears i have 20.5% i think she is just sweettalking me so i dont throw it away.

Im as sedentary as it gets

I try to log about 2000 calories a day with roughly 25-30 carbs whether i actually go to the pool or take the day off.

So in the album there is the last configuration of the calculator that i have made this morning ,  should i lower the protein since i dont exercise that much?).

Those are the kind of questions i have.

My goal is to keep losing body fat /weight while keeping whatever small amount of muscle i have.

I want to eventually join a gym to start lifting some

Basically, why mess around with CKD &amp; TKD?  This may be a bias from reading Volek &amp; Phinney, but if you're running on fat, with steady energy levels and decent performance, why screw around with carbohydrate timing?   Is this something that applies more to lifting VERY heavy weights, I don't usually lift more than myself.  

What I have liked a lot about keto is that it's simple.  I have a lot going on and I often train in the evenings... when I was following more conventional bodybuilding type eating plans from trainers and such, train after dinner, go to sleep, get up and eat breakfast with no real consequences to my energy levels or training.  It's easy.  Easier than eating moderate carbs even, when I get cranky if I don't get some carbs after training.

Sup guys, my gym performance has gone to shit, and muscles are flatter than holy hell. My appetite was incredibly higher than it was when I started, I was just tired of these last 10 lbs staying with me forever and not budging.

Anyways, and Flexible Dieting and wow, that man is really a genius. I took his advice and did a brutal glycogen depleting workout and almost threw up. It's basically 3 exercises per major body part (Chest, quads, arms, delts, back, with 4 sets of 15 reps

My macros in the first day were: 50g fat/350g carbs/180g protein. The second day was 45g fat/300g carbs/150g protein and finally the last day they were 40g fat/250g carbs/150g protein. I have resumed keto (&lt;50g carbs) today

Who should do carb refeeds? In my opinion, and anaerobic based athletes (soccer, lax, football) should do them. My incline DB press went from 55 lbs on each side to 70 lbs within a few days. My two pack turned into a 4 pack (4 more to go baby!). My muscles feel full.

Who should not do refeeds? Sedentary individuals, fat is a fine fuel and will spare protein because protein and glucose requirements are not high at all for aerobic exercise.

Just a quick note as well, please. I had a lot of flour, grains, etc. the first day and pooped my brains out. The second day I switched to sweet potatoes, pumpkin squash, and white potatoes and felt much better. I added rice too and it worked well, just stay away from gluten it will fuck you up.

If you have any questions feel free to ask, just use them correctly. They're a great fuel source for high intensity activity and Dr. Ellis is wrong, you cannot sustain high intensity using intramusclular triglycerides...this is just wrong and he's a nut and don't listen to him, he hasn't had a piece of fruit in over 10 years and looks like he's going to crumble into dust.

Once again I got a question or an idea

I am on SKD for a longer time now (6months) and have made damn good progress

I read a lot in the last time and yes I a also read the FAQ.
I read about the CKD and the TKD

At the moment I am doing a SKD + leangains approach. 
I skipp breakfast and get my first and biggest meal after my workout. I only take some BCAA's before my workout.

I read the CNS by Kiefer and he stats that after a longer phase of hypocaloric and/or low carb eating

It is a similar approach as the CKD

So my question (since I am pretty neurotic when it comes to weight gain): Is it possible to enhance the (my) fatloss if you stay strict keto for 6 days and then eat carbs in a 6-8 hour window (still only in moderation (maintenance or slightly above). Plus combined with a IF eating pattern.

I've got a few specific questions if anyone out there can help me. I've done hours worth of reading but can't seem to find conclusive answers specific to my queries. I apologise in advance for the length of this post but I've got no one who would understand what I'm talking about without saying ""no carbs are you mad?!"" I've learned a lot from Jeff Volek and Stephen Phinney's studies on performance

I'm a competitive runner, so whilst each individual effort isn't flat out, it's certainly in the VO2max region, so presumably very reliant on glycogen. 

Ok so my worries are due to performance and whether this diet is capping my ability levels and subsequent race performance. I've been on strict keto now for about 75 days and I'm fully fat adapted. Blood ketone readings on the monitor have been showing levels ranging from 1.1 to 3.1mM β-hydroxybutyrate so a definite state of nutritional ketosis with no risk of false readings from ketostix. 

What I've found is that for my aerobic paced running, last night we did 15 x 300m on the track and even though I completed the session fine, I felt that I didn't have an extra top gear to go into, especially during the last few efforts. I used to ramp up the pace and do an especially fast one at the end, but this time I was struggling to cling onto my club mates to do a 50s last rep, when 3 months ago I could absolutely drop them and throw in a 45s last rep. It seems raw power has been lost. 

So a few thoughts:
(a) Every time I run now and feel anything bad like tiredness I instantly think oh it must be my diet and it throws doubt over the whole thing. In the past when I'd be tired I'd just get on with it but now I've got something to blame. 
(b) It's the back end of winter
(c) Depiste keto being one of the only diets which supposedly maintains lean body mass
(d) I've read from some of the experts like Peter Attia and Jeff Volek that they don't recommend keto for say a 400m athlete as it would reduce their ability due to glycogen depletion

So to continue this epic length post

(1) Ketosis apparently isn't synonymous with glycogen depletion according to a few experts
OR

(2) I've been reading about CKD and TKD as a way of solving my problems. CKD doesn't make sense to me due to the fact I train every day
How does that work though

Sorry for such a long post, so I'm reluctant to change, but first and foremost it's my athletic performance that matters to me. I would NEVER consider going back to the conventional high carb diet but if I had to change I would maybe look at some sort of primal diet including tubers etc as my carbs, or maybe some slow release complex carbs.

This is the second time I've done keto; the first time, and the little belt of fat on my waist is shrinking steadily. Still though I want to know why I'm only gaining weight, and haven't lost any. 

I do the Stripped 5x5 routine religiously, and since none of my family are in keto, I end up eating mostly 2-6 scrambled eggs a day, along with whatever sandwich meat and cheese I can find in the fridge.

 &gt;TL;DR Lost 30lb and 11% BF with keto and a 4-day split; want to gain strength

I have made decent progress in the 4 months I've been combining lifting with keto (at a deficit) – I've had my n00b gains and cut down from 216lb

All very promising and all very standard in terms of a newbie going at it hard.

I do a 4-day split

**Mon:** Shoulders/Tris (Seated Shoulder Press, Kickbacks and cable pushdowns)

**Tues:** Back (Bent over barbell rows, one-arm rows)

**Thurs:** Chest/Bi (Flat barbell bench, various curls)

**Fri:** Legs (Deadlift, Leg Curl, Calf Raise)


**1RMs**

Deadlift: 120kg

Squat: 100kg

Bench: 60kg

OHP: Never tried


I have been eating at a consistent deficit and losing fat at a decent pace; I am by no means happy with my current BF% but I am willing to swap fast progress here for progress elsewhere. That is pretty much true for the 'big goals' everyone sets; I don't mind losing fat much slower if I can increase my lifts while I do it.

My plan is to follow a simple and slow body recomp; where I modify my split to include strength sets before my 'hypertrophy' sets

I would eat at a surplus on strength days and eat at significant deficit on my off days. Probably adding cardio

I figure my alternatives are:

Carry on at a deficit
Bulk – Bulking at 20% BF doesn't appeal to me

So

Am I simply asking far too much of my body? Am I being totally stupid? If so, any suggestions as to how not to be completely stupid here would be absolutely grand.

Looking for some tips and a critique of my plan. In short, 65F/30P/5C). I drink virtually all water all day (I have an occasional Michelob Ultra or Coke Zero here and there but it's rare).

**What I've been doing so far:**

* I've read that LISS cardio is preferred. I've been doing 60 minute treadmill sessions keeping my HR around 130. I've been doing this at least once per day with the occasional skip. Sometimes twice a day.

* I've also been doing mainly chest and shoulder targeted weight training. My gym is usually really busy when I go so getting free access to weights (which is already kind of limited) can be tough. But I do have a dumbbell set at home which I use for a morning workout every few days. My routine usually involves about 30-45 minutes of (all dumbbell) benching, extensions, etc.


**What my goals are:**

* Quit smoking (DONE - 8 days out and feels amazing)
* Get down to 199.
* Build some solid muscle and start losing my man boobs.
* Run a 9 minute mile by the end of the year (which sounds slow but is pretty good for me given my almost 400 pound lifestyle)
* Have my future children think I'm Superman.


The motivation is there. I know a lot of people go into this kind of thing really passionate at the beginning but end up falling off. I'm serious about everything. I don't want to be the fat fuck anymore who sits around playing video games (which is pretty much all I did last summer). I want to go bungee jumping and hike up a god damn mountain. I want to pull kittens out of trees and save babies from burning buildings. I had my heart broken pretty hard a few months ago - I want her to see me and go ""damnnnnn I walked out on THAT? I'm such a fuckng idiot!""

I gave the Starting Strength regimen a go for about 3 weeks but wasn't able to make the posted improvements/increases and a lot of the forums point the finger at a lack of improvement at deviations from the diet plan in the regimen so I went back to my swimming &amp; joined a Krav Maga class 3 days a week for variety &amp; fun.

I watch this subreddit &amp; see a lot of ""body builders"" who are successfully getting swole and I watch the keto subreddit &amp; see a lot of people on their way to becoming skinny (possibly ""skinny fat"") and I'd like to end up somewhere in between. It's easy to do things I enjoy i.e. swimming competitively and my Krav Maga class now I'm just working on finding something I enjoy that can increase my strength.

* Reduction in facial acne
* Healthier oral hygiene
* Trips to the physician are very rare (2 times a year)
* Awesome cooking skills
* Decreased blood pressure
* Less money spent on groceries
* No more seasonal allergies (in the spring and autumn)

Additionally I feel more alert, several weeks ago my dad initiated my help when he entered the biggest loser at his workplace (and won! or should I say lost almost 20 lbs).

My Keto history - 
I have been on strict keto since 13-April 2013, which is less than the 1400 kCal above, plus I have been exercising about 300 – 400 kCal per day for 6 days of the week. Yet I do not seem to lose weight at the rate that MFP indicates at the end of each day. There is a barely perceptible drop during the past 3 – 4 weeks.
My goal – drop to 135 lbs (but I would rather go by 15% BF)
My exercise routine is as follows:
Day 1 – Upper body workout - ~ 1.25 hrs – pull down, one arm lifts, chest press
Day 2 – Lower body workout ~ 1.25 hrs – leg curls both ways, inclined crunches, weighted lunges, box jumps, box steps.
Day 3 – Cardio total of 35 min – equivalent of Hill training on the exercycle (1 min of high resistance at setting “25”
Day 4 – recovery day (maybe gentl-ish walk in the park for 45 mins with the wife)
Repeat cycle in the following days. I do not have a gym trainer.
Question – What am I doing right or wrong? Is my exercise routine advisable or do you advocate changes? Is cardio helping at all? Is anything I’m doing being counterproductive? I read so many conflicting posts regarding cardio vs weights.

I recently completed the [Empire State Building Run Up](http://distilleryimage7.s3.amazonaws.com/317c9dbe70ce11e2974222000a1fbdac_7.jpg), I plan on focusing on lifting, along with some recreational biking. And I'm open to triathlons since I'm 2/3 the way there with my hobbies.

My weight dropped from 188 lbs to 165-ish by September and after that I just couldn't get any lower. Sure, I wanted that number on the scale to go down. Stubborn bastard.

As the year rounded out, in a fasted state, and I didn't like it. Plus, I was falling asleep in my morning meetings so I said ""F this.""

[EDIT: I realized I left something out here. Jan 2 was also the first day I started using MyFitnessPal. I've used it every day since and it's made a world of difference. I cannot express how great that app has been for me.]

Then I came here, and modify my macros and caloric intake. Now, for the first time since the epiphany of keto, I feel like I'm starting to understand how *my* body works and reacts to what I put in it, and how I can get the most out of my time spent in the gym.

For the past two and a half weeks, I'm having better lifts, and I'm far less dependent on caffeine to get through the day. The only part of IF I still follow is no eating after 8pm. This isn't a problem unless I'm drinking, but that's a fish of a different color.

[This is a comparison of Jan 2 to Feb 9.](http://i.imgur.com/sk6w0zw.jpg) So 3 weeks keto + IF followed by TKD. I'm sticking with TKD.

Today I took at least 4, and while my fasting blood glucose is a beautiful 85 mg/dL, while exercising I found that my blood glucose peaked at at least 114 mg/dL.

I was wondering if this is normal.  

Most diabetics are advised to exercise to help moderate their blood sugar

My diet is very nearly keto, probably averaging around 60 or 70 tops.  Otherwise boatloads of fat and about 150g protein.  Average calories is probably near 3500).  

EDIT: I stick to a standard keto diet

My workout plan is very heavy weights with a light and short jog to warmup.  So today for example I did 3 sets of overhead press at nearly maximal effort to get 5 repetitions (I managed 8 repetitions on my last set).  Then 3 sets of weighted chinups enough to cap me at 6 reps, 15, and then 10 (dips were definitely submaximal effort).  Right before the dips is when my blood sugar had peaked at 114.  After it read 108.

• Curtseys w/upright rows-5# DB 8x/ea

• Innerthigh ball squeeze in V-sit position 20x
 
• Finish with 2 more sets of tube@ ankle feet up crunches (20 reps)-you did one round as part of your warm up.

I had her formulate a workout that I could do at home with my dumbbell set. I do 3 days a week, and legs. Next week my reps will be increased to 12. the week after that I will increase my weights. 

I'm definitely feeling my arms get more solid and the fat on my arms is jiggly when before it was all combined with my muscle which made it so I couldn't get a proper caliper reading. My body fat is around 30%.

1375273261.0,1jf0am,Want to start more extreme IF to boost fat loss / Advice appreciated,Zorandel85,12,2,11,"Hello /r/ketogains comrades !
This is my first reddit submission so please bear with me and point out any reddit fallacies that I may commit.

**My stats first :**

Sex : Male

Age : 28

Starting weight (May 2012) : 166 kg (366 lb)

Current weight : 127kg (280 lb)

BF% : Hard to say

Goal weight : 85 kg (this is not set in stone

Do I lift : Yes. This is my 7th week lifting (impressive

How long on keto : Since the middle of March.

**Main part of this post**

Since starting keto I kind of naturally started doing my own version of IF. I eat breakfast some time between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m. and then go to work (8 a.m. - 4 p.m.). I then come home and eat between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. (depending if it's a lifting day or if I have some errands after work). This has been working fine for me and since starting keto my fat has been falling off.
However

So recently I've started thinking about incorporating a more srtict IF into my life. The main reason being the above one but also to improve the schedule my day and give me some more time in the evening.

So the plan is as follows : Wake up at 7 a.m. Work between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. 

Feeding window on lifting days : 

start : around 5:30 p.m.

stop : around 9 p.m.

Feeding window on non lifting days :

start : around 4:30 p.m.

stop : around 8 p.m.

Being hungry is rarely an issue on keto and I know I can pull this off.
The question here is : do you good people of the keto-lifestyle think this is a good idea ? I know that the ""classic"" IF approach (the one introuduced by Martin Berkhan) is 16/8 but I won't be able to do that.
Has anyone done IF with such a small feeding window (maybe it's not that small actually - I'm not sure).

Had a snack later on of some string cheese. Yum.  

Okay, we were at the cheesecake factory.   

Not too sure what was low carb, it's a thai style dish with shrimp and chicken in a spicy peanut sauce. They also have a low carb cheesecake on the menu, made with splenda, so I decided to go ahead and indulge in that as well. Second mistake.

Apparently the chicken and shrimp dish alone had almost 100g carbs even without rice and the cheesecake over 30.  *double shit.*

First

I workout 4 days/week most weeks. 3 weight sessions (30 minutes - 1 hour, I follow up with half an hour of cardio (usually treadmill or bike). So I guess basically 2-3 cardio, 3 weight sessions, condensed into 4 sessions overall.

I have made the call: there's a little bit of fat left on my abdomen I'd *ideally* like to lose

I am finding it difficult to eat enough protein: the days I manage it

I am pretty sure this is all down to caloric intake

I have raised my carbs on workout days to ~30g (basically I drink a smoothie with half a banana in it, but it's a more achievable goal) per day, and I don't even think about fat. I try to get the protein in and let the fat take care of itself.

I feel like I'm eating when I'm not hungry so I don't get tired. (And when I am tired

So I suppose what I'm asking really is:
Do you feel like you need to eat more than you'd actually prefer to eat? How do you  manage that feeling?

Is it more important to get enough protein or enough calories? (I could probably manage to eat more fat

It seems like HIIT is where the rage is and maximizes fat loss

When googling around it seems that everyone and their mother has their own interpretation of what HIIT is and suggested routines, etc etc.  Its quite confusing.  For the lifting side of things I kept my rest periods between sets to 60 seconds, doing a minimum of 10 reps and doing 3 sets + 1 warm-up for each muscle group. I worked up a good sweat during my lifting session, when I hopped on the elliptical before starting cardio my heart rate was in the 130's already. 

I'm shooting for a 3 day lifting program right now because that best fits my schedule. So Gym days are Mon/Wed/Fri with an additional cardio done on Sat or Sun.

If you're stalling, not just the food part.

Being hydrated makes a HUGE difference in lifts and workouts.  It also will prevent you from retaining water

It's absolutely necessary to drink enough water when you're slamming protein back.  Proteins are AMINO acids which means that you'll need to get all that Nitrogen out of your body to prevent fun things like organ damage and gout.  Your kidneys are happy to provide that function

The keto diet is dead simple and it WORKS.  You can gain muscle on it as long as you're lifting heavy and eating enough protein

The number one question to ask yourself before posting about problems is: Are you hydrated?

Typically for breakfast I had either an bacon and eggs, lunch was either chicken with asparagus or a ham and cheese plate, and dinner was either a mixed meat grill or a steak/fish with salad. Seemed like every restaurant we looked at had one of these options, and you had to look at many many restaurants to find one that had something keto on the menu. But after a while I got sick of spending an average €50 a day on breakfast, lunch and dinner (meat is damn expensive compared to bread and pasta). It just didn't feel worth it if I was bored with the foods choices. 


So I thought I'd eat more carbs and I comforted myself with the fact that the insulin should help with my gains


I had a bloated stomach and gas (carbs = smelly farts)


I felt nauseousness and had headaches


I felt hungry at night and first thing upon waking all I could think about was eating


I had oily skin



I've been back in keto now for a few days, but it reaffirmed that my body prefers a ketogenic lifestyle.

I'm not sure if this question is coming from conflicting information or a misunderstanding of information but let me give you a breakdown of what I'm struggling to wrap my head around and hopefully someone can help me out.

*Assumptions (facts)*

 * I'm on SKD (for the last 5months)
 * The majority of my non-cardio workout comes from resistance machines and a bar I have at home (3/4 times per week)
 * I'm currently losing around 1.5-2lbs per week on a calorie intake of anything between 1
 * I'm 14lbs from my goal.
 * Stats: 5'10 male
 * Assume I get an adequate amount of protein to avoid muscle deterioration  

Some sources say that lifting to build muscle whilst losing fat is impossible

I'd like to get started on a SS programme but I'm confused about what this will actually do from reading things about muscle deterioration/calorie deficits.

I would really appreciate a critique.  There’s a lot of information here but I have a lot of questions (bulleted at the end). I’ve read through the sidebar and other posts many times

I filled out the Keto Calculator to the best of my abilities and got this:
---
*Generated by [Keto Calculator](http://keto-calculator.ankerl.com) 5.11*

25/M/6'3"" | CW 250 | 25% BF | Moderately active

* 2890 kcal Goal
* 25g Carbohydrates
* 176g Protein (120g min
* 232g Fat (92g min

----

I am currently trying to lose some fat and put on muscle at the same time. Because of the way my weight is distributed

**WORKOUT**

I work out Monday, then active rest (2-4 hours of pickup basketball) Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, I usually work a double on Sunday so have no time to work out. 

**A Day** (all weights listed as current weights after de-loading several times for the sake of form

* Squat 5X5 (95 lbs)
* Bench 5X5 (80 lbs)
* Bent Over Rows 5X5 (80 lbs)
* Pushups (4 sets to failure)
* Reverse crunches (3 sets of 12)
* Tricep Pulldowns 5X5 (30 lbs)
* Approx 20 minutes cardio

**B Day**

* Squat 5X5
* Overhead Press 5X5 (80 lbs)
* Deadlift 5X5 (125 lbs)
* Pullups (4 sets to failure- but I can’t actually do any unassisted)
* Planks (3
* Arnold Press 5X5 (20 lbs)
* Side Raises 5X5 (15 lbs)
* Approx 20 minutes cardio

**DIET**

99% of my **food** comes in the form of one of the following:
* An assortment of Oscar Meyer lunch meats with slices of Cracker Barrel cheese
* A bowl of lean ground beef with melted cheese
* Spinach salad with creamy Caesar dressing
* Grocery store rotisserie chicken with slices of Cracker Barrel cheese


For my **drinks**, when I’m really weak, like 8 oz of Diet Coke at work.  


On the advice of some friends who are huge supporters of Ketos and Gains
* Pre-Workout: Muscle Pharm Assault
* Post-Workout Protein: Gold Standard Whey Double Chocolate


**QUESTIONS**

Before I move on to my specific questions

***Workout***

1). Weightlifting (and going to the gym in general) went from something I couldn’t stand to something I now can’t get enough of. I am still very much a novice but I find it therapeutic and want to shoot for a 6 days on/1 day off split. Can you suggest anywhere I can go to research something like that? Everywhere I’ve seen relies on the assumption that when you start you only want to go 3-4 days per week and then when you get serious you move up to heavier days

2). Any suggestions about how to step up the amount of work I’m doing with arms, side raises, and tricep pulldowns were all late additions to try to remedy this but I would appreciate anything you’ve got. 


***Diet***

1). I have been exclusively doing SKD but the same friends who suggested the supplements suggest I switch to TKD by simply having a handful or gummi bears right after my pre-workout and before my post-workout supplement (i.e. within 20 minutes of the beginning and end of the workout). On the FAQ it says Nerds are good so I assume these work the same

2). I’m confused and can’t seem to get a conclusive answer about how much vegetables I can eat. I would like to integrate a lot more vegetables into my diet. Is too much Broccoli/Cauliflower/Spinach/Kale a bad thing? 

3). The Gold Standard 100% Whey I’m using is a protein Isolate. My friend originally suggested I use Evo Pro because of the Casein

***Misc***

1). What’re your favorite workout songs? I’ve got like 70-80 songs on my playlist but I’m starting to get tired of them. 

2). Do you know of any books/websites where I can read *a lot* about Keto and working out? I have read everything in the sidebar but am looking to really get a good

3). How’re you doing today? Thanks for everything if you’ve read this far

I've read through everything on the side-bar

If I get the reassurance

Typically, I would exercise A LOT. Meaning I would go to the gym at least 6/7 days and do 30-40 minutes of elliptical training on rotating intervals AND lift weights 4-5 days a week. Doing this would result in about 20-25lbs. lost in 2.5-3 months. However, because I am a college student, I would regain all if not more of this weight during the school year and then lose it again in the summer. Well it's summer time, and I'm making the choice to stick to a plan for as long as it takes. I currently weigh 255 lbs. with a goal weight of 170 lbs.

I've come to /r/ketogains to get answers to these questions:

- Can I maintain this type and frequency of exercise?
- Is exercising that much even good for me?
- If I understand correctly
- I like exercising because it makes me feel awesome
- I've read Tom Venuto's Burn the Fat, healthy, and successful diet. Can keto harm me and is it worth it?

1367423116.0,1dhiw9,Gym Anxiety - my expereince,nothingtoseehere28,10,2,14,"I wanted to share my experiences getting over my anxiety in the gym (or at least working on it) in the hope of giving others a bit of a boost and perhaps helping them make the step to get into the gym. 

First of all, 20-35lbs). After being chronically sick for a year I decided it was time to start moving and get healthy. I started at home with body weight movements and then once I built up some strength I was ready to hit the gym. 

I realized that at that point I was physically stronger than I was mentally. The idea of picking up a barbell was much harder than the physical act of picking it up. Regardless of how much I read or how many youtube videos I watched or how much I practiced my form

However, I didn't use the heaviest weight I could handle and I often finished my workout well before I should have finished my workout. Probably not so good for physical gains, but it really helped me mentally adjust. 

I'm well behind where I had hoped I'd be at this point (partially because of going so slowly, I push myself, and when I'm done my work out it's because I'm done my workout. 

So I guess what I'm saying is fear of the gym isn't uncommon

Some tips for getting over the anxiety:

* find out when the gym is least busy (early mornings
* knowledge is power - if you feel confident in what you're doing that's one less thing to worry about. Understand the theory/form/science if that's the way your brain is wired. 
* Measure your progress against yourself. Even if it's slow. Even if you're only going up by 2.5lbs at a time
* keep at it. You will get better. You will feel more comfortable. Your brain will adjust to the thought of picking up something heavy. It just takes practice.

Im starting to do [this routine](http://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/dumbbell-only-home-or-gym-fullbody-workout.html) 3 days a week [using these](http://imgur.com/0P40ISA)(free sleeping cat) how many calories im roughly spending ? i do the exercises in there that i can (i dont have a pull up bar for example) so i end up doing 5/6 exercises of each day.

Usually i dont really break sweating (not like i would if i was running for example) but i do reps till my arms or abs cant do another rep then rest a bit and go at it again.

I do the reps with roughly 12 lbs or so and usually at about the 5th or 6th rep it starts to burn and then i power till the 8th or 10th 

Also should i be using different weight in the left arm (it wears out much faster than my right arm).

My plan is to eat whatever amount of calories you guys advice me to and then alternate the dumbbell weights routine i linked before and walking about 5 miles every other day.

So if im doing this and with the only goal of actually losing weight and feeling better how many calories should i 
be eating ?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated as i said before i know nothing about this matter also English isnt my first language so i hope i made it all bearable.

This, and I want to know where I'm going wrong and what I need to do to fix it; but of course the trainers will only give away so much free advice.  

With all that in mind

Current weight: 240 lbs; (down from 308 in Dec. 2011)  
current body fat: ~25%   
height: 6'4""  
diet: standard ketogenic
current workout plan: Rippetoe's *Starting Strength* original novice program

squat 1rm: 210    
bench press 1rm: 179   
deadlift 1rm:  225

Goals: Lose ~25 lbs. body fat  
increase 1rms to an acceptable level for that body weight  
build noticeable muscle definition  

Now
For one, that I shouldn't be worried about losing body weight, just losing body fat. So my question here is should I eat to gain and keep weight training without worrying about losing weight? Should I just build up muscle, keep eating keto but with more calories?  

My other question

Am I way too concerned with weight loss when what I *really* should be doing is building up muscle mass?

Delicious! Milds the sour immensely. Tastes like a mild lemonade. The coconut oil sort of creates a frothy topping that adds to the experience.

My highest weight was 268 which I earned by eating everything in sight.  I travel for work about 100-150 nights per year so that makes working out difficult.  If I have a local gym I can use I will go and continue my normal routine

Here are some current [pics](http://imgur.com/a/dMVMS)  NSFW shirtless chubby dude.

My current diet is roughly 2

I am training for my second tough mudder and plan to work myself up to 10-11 mile runs with 2 smaller 3-5 mile runs per week.  I do not plan to run more than 22 miles per week.  I also will occasionally do 30 minutes of intervals as opposed to steady state running.  Right now I am running around 12 miles per week.

For lifting I am mostly following a starting strength type routine but I have substituted dumbbell lifts for bench press and ohp as I was having shoulder pain.  

My current numbers for my lifts are:

Deadlift  275x5
Squat  265x5
Benchpress  235x5
DB Bench  70x5 (just started and working on form)
Seated DB Press  60x5  (almost ready to move up to 65
Pullups and chins.  I can finally do pullups but I am doing them daily at home everytime I walk by the bar.  Probably 20-30/day
Seated Iso-row machine 180x10

On the road I will do circuits of dumbbell exercise (max 50 pounds).  I was thinking of switching Insanity as it would be easy to throw on my laptop and do anywhere.  I find it is nearly impossible to work pull exercises on the road.

I am worried that I may be undereating given the amount of exercise I am doing.  I am trying to get my protein numbers back up

Sample diet while I am at home:

Breakfast/lunch:  
3 egg omelet, meat.  MFP regularly puts this around 700-900 calories w/ cream for coffee.

Post workout:  2 scoops of whey in water

Dinner:
Ribeye Steak
Asparagus

MFP recommends I eat around 1800 calories per day to lose 2 pounds per week.  I have adjusted my macros and rarely go over 30g net carbs per day.

I have been thinking to add a pre-workout supplement that includes carbs before my lifting sessions and take in 10-30g carbs with that.

Feel free to critique, berate, encourage, ignore, etc. 


I'm a 27 year old male, and I've been maintaining a daily intake of 2000-2100 a day (except last night. I went like 2000 calories over my maintenance, on all Keto friendly foods. I wanted cheese, meat, and entire bag of pork rinds. No big deal, still in ketosis, feel great.) 

I hit the 65-30-5 macros daily

A few years ago, I feel almost skinny fat. I have extra skin from the weight loss, and I don't feel like
I'm putting on the muscle that I want to be. 


I've been lifting at the gym for a few months now. I'll do a brief outline of what I've been doing. 

M: Neck/shoulders. Shrugs, some super set raises. 

T: Rest

W: Back. seated machine rows, bent over barbell rows

TH: Biceps/Triceps. Machine curls/tri ext super setted, skull crushers, cable bi and tri, dips. Mostly supersetted for time constraints. 

F: Rest or cardio

Sa: Chest. Bench (flat,) cable flys, machine flies, seated incline dumbell presses

Su: Legs. Squats

Like I said, and some toning. I usually work out in the morning, fasted with a scoop or two of C4 pre workout. I've not been having any trouble with energy or maintaining an hour long workout while on Keto. 


I guess I just don't know where to go from here. I can see myself sticking with Keto long term. It's the first diet plan/life style I can say that about. I don't crave carbs, and have no problem eating set meals daily. 

I don't know if I could get down with CKD, if not painful feeling. 

I've been reading about TKD, is it worth it?

Am I overworking myself? I don't feel fatigued

My overall goal here is to get my body fat percentage lower than it is currently (obviously) and obtain an athletic/toned look. I'm not looking for extreme bulk or body builder status
I just want to look good

That being said I was always disciplined enough to go to gym for the past 2 years. This resulted in me getting fat but also quite strong.

I have been on SKD for going onto 4 months now and I have been losing a good amount of weight. The visual results are pretty astounding however my lifting numbers have tanked. As a lifter I have come to miss the benefits of glycogen. I was wondering if CKD could at least help me get my lifting numbers up while still reaping in the fat loss benefits of keto.

If so what is the general guideline for CDK? I have seen people state that they eat 200g of carbs in a single (carb) night weekly and others eat in excess of 700g of carbs along 2 days of carbloading. I was wondering which is the best for someone in my situation?

My previous attempts at losing weight were all done without keto and with exercising 3 x 2 hours per week (of those 2 hours, so in the remaining 1,5 hours I took it rather easy. Anyway, those attempts never resulted in any noticeable weight loss, nor did I really feel any better. Those carbs, man.

So, I think on average it would sit around 1700 or so), and I never feel hungry.

1375202774.0,1jcw6e,Torn between what to do...[NOOB],rma0081,10,1,7,"Howdy yall

Here is my current situation: I'm a fattie who wants to lose fat, in that order. Wow, super original, right? But don't worry, I've read the FAQ, I've read through Ketogains, but I just never quite found what I was looking for.

**STATS**-M5'11"" approx. 235lbs, but I dunno if that's right.  Eating between 2000-2500 calories a day, Stronglifts 3x per week, walking a few miles a few times a week. Work in a restaurant, so move a pretty decent amount per day, but I've done it for awhile, so I know my body has adjusted for efficiency

NOW, we agreed to dress in slutty (well, manly slutty) halloween costumes this year. That gives me about 3 months to get in the best shape I possibly can get in so I'm not jiggling around 6th street all night. 

I know that diet is king, at least in terms of keto. I've lost maybe 10lbs since July (it fluctuates and my scale is not super accurate. Could be more like 5. Plus there was a whole helluva lot of cheating in July...). In addition, I just finished day 1, week 5 of stronglifts. Go me! So yeah, thats where I'm at now.

HOWEVER, consistency is everything, even if you have not the best program. So i've got that. This is a lifelong journey, and I know its gonna be a little slow. That's okay. I'm in it for the long haul. It'd just be real nice if I was decently attractive by then though. However, if I'm not, I'll just suck in my gut, flex a lot

So my question is this: what would you recommend as the quickest way to look the best by halloween (i.e. achieving max sexiness)?

* 1.) Stronglifts on a mild calorie deficit
* 2.) Stronglifts with a mild calorie deficit plus 3 days cardio (jogging
* 3.) Some sort of hypertrophy routine with a calorie deficit
* 4.) Big calorie deficit
* 5.) Literally anything else.

1374459002.0,1isasr,[Noob] I'm ready to take my keto experience to the next level. I could use some help and critique. [Warning: Long],aasukisuki,8,2,8,"Hello Ketogains!

I've been on keto since the beginning of the year, and I just want to get clarification, and suggestions.

I have a scale that gives my body fat %, I would guess that I’m closer to 25%, so I guesstimated at 23% Ultimately I’d like to get down to around 15% body fat.  Using the Ketogains calculator, I came up with 2 sets of macro #’s to maintain my weight.  Those numbers are:

Non-Workout Days:  2081 Calories | 27% Protein | 4% Carbs | 69% Fat

Workout Days:  2306 Calories | 25% | 4% Carbs | 71% Fat

Question Set 1:  I’ve read that you can’t lose fat and gain muscle at the same time, adjust my calories to maintain weight?

As far as eating goes, as well as a magnesium supplement and a liberal use of nu-salt for the potassium.  I’m also planning on getting MCT oil to add to coffee, pre-workout, as well as some whey powder.

Question Set 2:  Do these steps sound reasonable?  Any suggestions on best time of day to workout?  I read that you shouldn’t eat a fatty meal after working out, should whey protein be taken before or after working out? 

Speaking of working out, 3 days lifting 3 days cardio.  Lifting days were alternated between  upper body / lower body.  Here is the regimen I was doing previously.  These were done in a pyramid style, upping weights each set.  The goal is to max out during the last set of 12 of the secondary exercise.

Each pyramid looks like:

[Primary Exercise]

12 Reps @ base

10 Reps @ base + 5lb

8 Reps @ base + 10lb

6 Reps @ base + 15lb

12 Reps @ base + 10lb

[Secondary Exercise]

12 Reps @ base + 10

Here are the workouts I was doing previously:

Upper Body Workout:

[Primary] Dumbbell Fly 

[Secondary] Dumbbell Bench Press


[Primary] Dumbbell Bent-Over Row

[Secondary] One Arm Row


[Primary] Dumbbell Shoulder Press

[Secondary] Dumbbell Lateral Raise


[Primary] Dumbbell Biceps Curl

[Secondary] Concentration Dumbbell Curl


[Primary] Lying Triceps Extension

[Secondary] Triceps Kickback


Lower Body Workout:

[Primary] Beginner Squat

[Secondary] Dumbbell Lunge


[Primary] Machine Leg Curl

[Secondary] Straight Leg Deadlift w/ Dumbbells


[Primary] Calf Jump w/ Dumbbells

[Secondary]  Standing Dumbbell Calf Raises

[Primary] Wheel Rollout (no weights)

[Secondary] Bicycle Kick (no weights)


I do have access to a gym

Male, 18-20% BF (visual estimate, calipers in the mail!).  My goals are to get stronger and have a nice athletic body (not lean, but not looking for a bodybuilder type body).  I did StrongLifts for a bit, then switched over to Starting Strength because power cleans and am making pretty good progress.  I also ride my bike quite often.  I commute to work (only 2 miles round trip), but I also go out on rides just to ride.  These rides range anywhere from a few miles to 15+ if I'm feeling frisky. 

Now for the questions:

* Should I continue a lifting routine while doing CrossFit?   I assume no

* Is it possible to perform well at CrossFit on SKD?  Should I give it a try or try switching to TKD or CKD?  Or even Paleo?

Thanks for your help.

I've posted this to /r/keto but I'm sure you guys could offer some advice before I embark!

In the last 6 years, and packing on a few pounds of muscle. Stats:

* Current weight: 189lbs
* Goal weight: 168lbs

* Current body fat: 25%
* Goal body fat: 13%

Here is the general plan I've worked out from reading over the years. It includes 100g protein and 80g of fats

**Diet:**

* Training - 20 minute jog
* Breakfast - 3 eggs + tsp oil + 1tbsp benecol + black &amp; red pepper + spinach
* Snack - Greek yoghurt + cinnamon
* Lunch - 1 tin of tuna + 1tbsp benecol + black &amp; red pepper + cucumber
* Training - (resistance training
* Dinner - 3 eggs + tsp oil + 1tbsp benecol + black &amp; red pepper + lettuce
* Snack - Greek yoghurt + cinnamon

**Training regime:** 5 sets 8 reps of each exercise. 

**Split:** Push - Pull - Rest - Push - Pull - Rest - Rest

**Push day:**

* Dumbbell Shoulder Press
* Dumbbell Bench Press
* Barbell Squats

**Pull day:**

* Barbell Deadlifts
* Dumbbell Leant-over Reverse Fly
* Dumbbell Lateral Raises
* Cable Lateral Pulldown

**Justifications:**

* I'm only working the big muscle groups because I want to be physically-able
* I try to use dumbbells and cables rather than resistance machines and barbells
* I generally stay away from red meat so I'm trying to get the fat from other sources.
* I've been advised that Benecol reduces the buildup of fat within the arteries

My biggest concern is that my lifts are pretty low. I have been lifting for about 6 weeks and here are my stats:  

Deadlift - 50x10 (warm up), 85x8, 90xfailure (usually 5-6 reps). 
Squat - 50x10 (warm up), 80x5 (do not go to failure on squats). 
Bench - barx10 (warm up), 55x10, 60x5 (my bench seems low and I am contemplating doing smolov in the future to get it higher; friend just went from a 70kg 1RM to a 90kg 1RM in three-four weeks). 

Does this look okay? I know TKD is recommended for more experienced lifters

I generally do all these compounds and then use machines or isolates to work a particular muscle group

I started keto recently, 5' 8"", cw: 208lb, gw: 160lb, lbm:135ish). My goals are to lose the fat involved inmeeting my goal, and building a healthy amount of strength/muscle, also to look damn good. I started a week after my buddy on keto and have been using the mfp app to track my intake; it said my intake should be 1200cal/day. All the caloric intake calculators I've used since then (ive been reading a bit to get a better handle on things) have said to intake a bit over 1600 cal per day for continued loss, so for the first few weeks I was eating roughly 1200

As far as lifting is concerned, I'm enjoying weights again and am looking forward to losing all this fat I've accumulated while gaining muscle :)

My questions are probably pretty common:
-how does it work, and today I'm up 208. I know it's foolish letting a few pounds bugger me up, but it sure is distracting. I took my body measurments and will start looking at changes there. If I've started building muscle, at what point will I see the lbs come off on the scale? 
-my buddy who's also on keto, this is my first time losing so much weight and hopefully the only time ill have so much to lose, but I'm under the impression muscle burns cals even when resting..

My story: I started keto in mid-January at 130 lbs and made it to my goal weight of 110 a few weeks ago. I was also running, not be able to run fast. I also want to bring my bf% down to more like 20. So a few weeks ago I started doing some light weight training, not really knowing wtf I was doing so much, I was just using a kettlebell and dumbbells. I upped my calories on exercise days to 'gain muscle' as per the calculator, kept rest days at about maintenance, and that's where I gained 2 pounds (no clue if it's fat or muscle because I didn't have calipers before and it's hard to tell). This week I decided to get serious and began Starting Strength (yesterday made day 2) and I really like it a lot and feel like it's actually going to get me somewhere.

I want to do SS 3 days a week as I'm supposed to

So here's where I have questions. Do I use the calculator to determine how many calories to consume on each different type of day? Like I'd use a ""gain muscle"" count for lifting days

Here's what I calculated:

Lifting Days: 1630 to gain

Yoga Days: 1389 to gain

Running Days (I don't really run much anymore

Rest Days: 1320 to gain

I lurk this subreddit (as well as keto, loseit, etc) all day. Like you, fellow lurker, I'm under the impression that the combination of keto and heavy weightlifting is the optimal strategy for fat loss and body recomposition. Between the touted efficacy of programs like Starting Strength and the proven advantages of the ketogenic diet, combining both seems like a no-brainer! I have been doing quite well in my pursuit of fitness using both tools, but I seem to have hit a wall with my lifting as of late. I figure I should ask for help before this subreddit explodes in popularity (with tons of credit going to darthluiggi, so here goes nothing. Some stats: 

Before (340lb) / After (240lb): [2 Chainz? More like 2 Chinz](http://i.imgur.com/oYZgJ.jpg)

Most recent: [Why yes

Age: **23**

Sex: **M**

Weight: **240**

Height: **5'8""**

Bodyfat %: Honestly no idea. LBM could be anywhere from 150 to 180 lb. I was never much of a bodybuilder until relatively recently, so I may have increased LBM due to that alone. I should probably have it measured with calipers at some point...

Lifts: Squat **250** (3x5) / Bench **170** (3x5) / DL **280** (1x5)/ OHP **125** (3x5)

Training frequency: **2x/week**

Goals: Cut down to 200lb/15%bf/abs/whatever
Other exercise: I work in an office

Macros &amp; targets: **I do IF**, &lt;10g carbs, the rest in fat. The low-ish calorie count (compared to the values recommended by the Ketogains Macro Calculator) is my attempt at doing a modified PSMF - I found that larger weekend meals sometimes greatly encroach on deficits built up during the week, so I've increased my weekday deficit to near-PSMF levels in addition to exercising more stringent self-control on the weekends (this involved **quitting trees**, as they often caused binge behavior :( ). Despite the protein intake, I realize that this is still a very low calorie intake given my strength goals.

Food: Typical meals during the week look like this: chicken/lean ground turkey cooked in 1tbsp of MCT-laden coconut oil alongside spinach/kale/chard/whatever I have available, yet still clean home-cooked meal like a Thai curry with coconut cream and tons of chicken) and will usually eat out on Saturday - [Sashimi Saturday](http://i.imgur.com/nTnLSqd.jpg) has been a [thing](http://i.imgur.com/2ms3qiw.jpg) recently, and I'm loving it :) - but these meals are, again, well-controlled for calories and protein. Aside from coffee, I almost exclusively drink sparkling water, save the bubbler at the gym.

Supplements: In the morning, green tea caps, and occasionally black coffee. Later on in the day, I usually take my fish oil w/ dinner as well as 10g creatine (all at once on rest days, 5g pre-/5g post-workout on lift days) with the occasional day off. I am of the understanding that someone of my size needs closer to 10g/day than the typically recommended 5g/day, but I could be mistaken. I take magnesium before bed, and liberally salt my food with sea salt and Lo-Salt.

My problem: Between what I'm eating, I'm definitely selling myself short somewhere. I rode the ""newbie gain"" wave for quite a while, but lately I seem to have been hitting a wall with my lifts. A lot of the time, I'll put up a PR on a set of lifts (adding 5 lbs over the previous), only to come back next time and barely be able to maintain those same numbers. I started ingesting ~5-7g of quick-release carbs right before lifting (typically a 'fun size' Gatorade G2, 30 cals 7g carb) and this seemed to help for about 10lb on all lifts but I seem to have stalled again. 

My questions: Should I **up my calories**, but it's very disheartening when each lifting session goes from being a tough-yet-doable challenge to an absolutely loathsome activity that I can barely do. I figured going down to only lifting 2x/week would help me recover given how little I'm eating right now, but that doesn't seem to have worked too well.

Apologies for the wall of text - I figure it's better to have too much information than too little

1359141521.0,179rag,[NOOB] Confused about TKD and how to achieve my goals,Jewssy,9,2,10,"Hey all. So I have read the FAQ and unfortunately

I am a 150lb female, however, I've done this before (I just fell off the bandwagon for a month or so -sadface-). Currently, I lift weights (almost no cardo unless it's conditioning week). I don't use machines, but barbells. So I'm doing jerks, snatches, squats (back and front), box jumps

Anyway... One of my questions is: should I postpone TKD until I get to my goal weight? I'd like to keep maxing out on my PRs (max week is every six weeks after a five week program), but I do find that some days are harder than others. I'm assuming that's because I'm only on my second week of SKD again and it's always harder during shark week (sorry, guys...), but I'm looking for a little advice as I'd like to lose fat and gain muscle. 

If I should start TKD say, what foods would be best? I have read some of the threads, but I'm still confused about it. Like, someone mentioned candy, well, what type of candy? What are easily digestible carbs that I can eat? I'm thinking of only eating about 20carbs before/after, however I'm still working through the math/science of all that as I don't know my body fat percentage and I'm still trying to understand it all. 

My last question, so I can continue maxing out, but I ask because again I'm still a bit confused. 

I am super sorry if this post is annoying and repetitive. I promise I've been reading, if not most, of this goes over my head.

Here's the question: If I have some carbs, then how many hours should I wait till I can resume my normal high-fat keto diet without risking large amounts of fat storage?

I realize the whole reason for the carbs post-workout is to create an insulin rise that is helpful for muscle growth following a workout, right? So how many hours should I wait after 'carbup' before I can eat keto again? Would 1 &amp; a half hours do it? Or should I be waiting till the next day and just go carb crazy on workout days in leangains style?

In case you think it's not worth it to have any carbs post-workout

Thanks!

Considering that it 50% of the weight must be water that's evaporated during the cooking process - would it be possible for me to somehow gauge how much fat i am losing when cooking the meatballs?

It's hard because I know the fat is going which screws my macros but also it screws with the calories of it. 

Should I maybe try to keep the left over fat and weigh that separate to the meatballs to figure out how many grams of fat is coming out?

I use MFP

I eat every three hours and usually have some raw spinach or other greens with every meal but don't take the time to count the calories because they're so low. I drink between a half-gallon and a full gallon of water daily. I sleep at least six hours a night

Breakfast (470 calories): 

* A protein shake made with almond milk
* Two tbsp of organic peanut butter
* Two slices of bacon

Lunch (230):

* Two string cheese sticks
* A few slices of no-salt roasted turkey

Dinner (280):

* Four oz of chicken breast
* One slice of bacon

Snacks (335):

* 1/4 cup of cashews
* Protein shake made with almond milk

On days that I exercise

I absolutely can't afford a gym membership

Three or four times a week

* Do three sets of pull-ups (the number of reps is embarrassing; I used to be able to do 15
* Do four to five sets of push-ups (same).
* Run about a 1.5 mile

The running is getting easier

I'm about 5'8"" and hovering around 165 lbs. I've been on SKD keto (with a few breaks) for about a year and I've lost about 55 lbs. Using a bunch of online calculators and a bio impedance meter

My diet is really simple. It's usually some mix of avocado, but I guess that I'm hitting about 1600 cals a day.
My workout regime has been primarily 5 sets of HIIT where a set is 5 minutes of 30 sec sprint 30 sec rest with 3 minutes of rest between sets. I do this between 2-5 times a week depending on my work schedule and whether or not I feel like I need a rest day; I'd say most weeks I get to the gym 4 times.

My goal is to get down to about 10% body fat (I wanna see my abs), and feeling like a badass. I was planning on cutting down as much as possible before starting a TKD or SKD diet to gain muscle. My defined goals at the end of the body transformation would be that I want to be able to bench at least 240, squat 350, and bicep curl 50 lbs (with the appropriate balance in antagonist muscle groups.)

Question 1: 
Should I continue to do running type (cardio) exercises or should I change it up and do some weightlifting?

- My concern in this regard is that weight lifting apparently burns less calories and I'd like to continue to lose weight before trying to bulk up. Also

Question 2: 
Should I switch to a TKD/CKD approach now

- I think that I would fall under the category of skinny fat now. My bench is probably about 120 lbs


Question 3: Do I need to be doing TKD/CKD for muscle gain or will SKD suffice? 

- There is just a lot of competing information stating that SKD is sufficient

If you carb up before every second workout, and shouldn't be listened to if they are advocating carbs for workouts.

SuperStarch? Same thing, for your energy and selling yourself short.

Then what do I do if I want instant energy? Well, they are the fast burning fats. Think of how there are high GI and low GI carbs depending on their complexity and chain-length... this same quick and slow burning thing happens for fats too! Animal fats are a combination of saturated and monounsat C16 and C18 fats, the number represents the length of the fat chain. They are Long Chain Triglycerides and are metabolized by the gut.

MCTS and SCFAs bypass most of the gut and are metabolized quickly like a fast carb. They will in fact BOOST KETOSIS because the liver converts the MCTs into ketone bodies, and SCFAs are C5 and below.

Their benefits range from a quick boost of energy (both mental and physical) to increasing insulin sensitivity and improving cholesterol

Now, but they do not take into account that they are using dextrose (a high GI sugar) vs C10 (a medium chain fat)... of course a faster burning fuel is going to win! They also never have a keto group of athletes or a keto group of controls, they are comparing MCTs on performance for carbed up athletes. I can guarantee you now that if you make yourself an MCT emulsion to drink before and while you work out you will perform damn well.

SCFAs are in two things

Hello fellow Ketonians! I’ve been waiting for this post for a long time because I am continuously doing research and constantly reading to keep learning and making sure I’m getting accurate information and doing things right!

 

Anyways – I’m about 5”10 and my weight fluctuates between 208-213 (~5 lb variation daily depending on water intake) and I would estimate my BF% anywhere between 18%-20% this is estimated by using the guide [here](http://www.leighpeele.com/body-fat-pictures-and-percentages). My weight is never something that concerned me because obviously muscle weighs more than fat

 

In any case, even though I fucked up last Monday and almost doubled the daily intake of carbs, I’m being a lot more strict about it now. It also has notes on the supplements I take and my workouts, it can be viewed [here](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/reports/printable_diary/workhardb).

 

On the diary above you’ll notice “calories burnt: *x*” which is from a watch that I find is the best overall fitness tracker called [MyBasis](http://www.mybasis.com/tour/) which calculates calories burnt throughout the day by tracking blood pressure and heart rate through shining two LED lights onto the wrist to track blood flow

 

I’m doing Aworkoutroutines intermediate muscle building routine as my workout

 

Here’s a two month difference picture of me since starting my workout routine and cutting some weight down.

I am 169kg now and want to start lifting again with ~150kg, just to gain some basic strength, pretty much follow good old Mark Rippetoe to the dot and go from there. Simply find an instructor, find a gym, get going with full steam like I did (lost 28kg 3.5 month on SKD, doing already bodyweight exercise and some lifts with an empty barbell).

My flat floor is out of laminat, imagine a barbell weight disk smashing it. No way I can do training at home with weighted barbells!

So you guys really appreciate with what level of retardedness I have to deal with over here, about the possibility of doing barbell-training and getting at least partnered with an experienced lifter or personal trainer. These are the results:

* 5 gyms said they had barbells but never heard about a squat rack
* 3 gyms adviced me to skip lifting and do cardio and do their shitty courses
* 5 gyms did not allow squatting due to the risks of injury and insurance issues
* 2 gyms gave positive feedback and an adequate proposition

None of them ever heard about Mark Rippetoe

I am sitting here scratching my head, meaning no car, which did not pose a problem here at all. 

So I need a gym here in hannover and I am speculating that maybe someone here is actually from around here and knows where to go.

Kenpokan and Aspria seem the only candidates to appreciate my approach on things, I jump through my providers cable to give you a hug!

I explained to him that my wife and I have both been on the ketogenic diet since September. He had no idea what I was talking about. I gave him a brief overview of what keto is all about and his first recommendation was that we change the way that we eat. We should be eating 6 meals a day

I asked him if he had a background in nutrition or if he was a dietician. He said that he wasn't, and our oldest son... eating a high fat diet has caused us to lose an entire one of him since September. Proof positive that he was wrong was sitting *right in front of him*. He gave up the argument. So we started talking about what I had in mind as far as my workouts.

I've been reading for a few days, Bench Press, Deadlift. Squats, Overhead Press, Deadlift. Lather, rinse, repeat. 3 days a week, with 2 rest days in between.

Evidently I was wrong. I have to work out on the machines. I have to do aerobics and cardio. And I had to do those for a while before I moved on to free weights. And I had to really think about how I'm eating and what I'm eating if I wanted to continue to lose weight. Then he sent us into a room with a trainer who had us doing jumping jacks, and some yoga.

So I already mentioned that I'm a noob. I'm uncertain about what I'm doing. I *think* I have a pretty firm understanding of where I should be headed... but I'm hesitant to say

And, shortly before working out. The overwhelming sweetness kept making me gag. How the hell do I manage to get 20-50g of *the right kind of* carbs in before a workout without sending my body into shock?",,False,self,t5_2v5mu,1372778748.0,,

1372369213.0,1h7fzp,"June Progress - Recovery Gains, Deficits, and some data points.",noobfriedrice,7,3

I made some adjustments to the above workout plan - for the last four weeks I have lifted 6 times a week, typically offset from the lifting session by 12 hours. I set my MFP app to track 1920 kcalories per day, at a 140g protein 140g fat base, and added kcalories from my exercises to maintain a net deficit of approximately 500kcal a day. Over four weeks that adds up to 14,000 kcal, and I have actually eaten under on a few days.

My workouts followed the HIIT-100 plan very closely, I felt like spaghetti every night. I TKD'd a few workouts but didnt notice a difference so for the most part it was strict SKD, the same as I had been doing since January.


While doing this exercise, with the workouts being at the trailing end of each 11 hour fast. I want to point out that the hunger pains on this diet were intense! However, I think there was clearly a big benefit to forcing catabolic states post-workout.

So now the interesting bit! Over the last four weeks, in averages, and was highly consistent day to day. I am 95% confident that it is not water weight gain (except that required by lean mass synthesis). In addition, my bf% came in today at just over 12%. Pretty fantastic for a month! The interesting part is the mechanics to get from 185/15% to 190/12%. This is a lean mass increase from 185*.85 = 157.25 lb to 190*.88 = 167.2 lb. This means I gained nearly 10 lbs of muscle, or 2.5 lbs per week. The maximum lean mass synthesis rate for drug-free new lifters (or recovering lifters) is about .015 lb per lb lean mass per week, which ends up being pretty close to 9.6 lb in 4 weeks. 

Similarly, for a total loss of 4.9 lb. This is about 1.25 lb/week.

So the fun math:

 3500 kcal deficit / week = -14

 4.9 lb * 3500 kcal / week = -17150 kcal

TOTAL = -31150 kcal


 9.8 lb * 1600 kcal = 15680 kcal


NET = -15470 kcal


So that's the interesting thing! Either my 'deficit' wasn't actually a deficit, recovering his high school physique. I plan to post some before/after pictures on July 3rd when I officially hit my 6 month mark!

Feel free to fire away questions, etc! I realize these numbers are pretty out of the ordinary, but I'm confident in my results, although I can't say everyone would have similar success.

After having tried SKD for about a month as an experiment last winter and loving it

At the recommendation of other users, I ate a bowl of Kashi GoLean with 2% milk and a couple tablespoons of PB2. It was more than an hour's drive to our starting point. Once I got there, I had two deviled eggs before we finally hit the road.

During our first pit stop about 20 miles in

There was a decent climb between the first and second pit stops that got me pretty tired, but also a quarter of a PB&amp;J sandwich and about two ounces of trail mix (the kind with M&amp;Ms). From there, we had a good downhill descent, and the remaining 6 miles or so of the ride was relatively flat; however, I found that I just couldn't keep up with the rest of my team for that last stretch. My muscles weren't necessarily cramped or fatigued, I just found that I had a lot less energy to keep my legs moving than I did earlier in the day. I wrapped up those last 6 miles at a leisurely 10-15mph pace, while the rest of my team were easily pushing closer to 20.

I suspect that maybe I was consuming the wrong types of carbs at potentially the wrong times? Maybe I'm not fully keto-adapted quite yet? Should I have avoided that sandwich at the second pit stop?

I've read the FAQ and what it says about TKD, so I definitely need to make sure I'm eating the right things before **and** during the race.

Any advice or feedback is certainly welcome!

In future Supplement Sundays we'll get a bit more in-depth about different kinds of supplements, and all that good stuff, but let's get started sounding off on what we take (or are considering)!

*mod hat: on* I know some people can develop very strong feelings about supplements they dislike, and only an idiot would buy it!"" *mod hat: off*


I'll get this thread started with a breakdown of some that I feel naked without

The Great: These are the ones I take day in

- Animal Paks Multivitamin: Really

- Fish Oil: Yup

- ZMA: Zinc, and get good quality sleep, but according to people who study things it also helps with muscle anabolism. As an added bonus, anecdotal evidence suggests that it helps you shoot bigger loads. :|

- Creatine Monohydrate: This is one I almost feel bad about putting on my Great list because I don't actually supplement it on a daily basis, some say it's worthless, I say it's cheap and if I get too much I don't mind paying an extra couple cents for every time I go pee.


The Good: These are the ones that I keep on my shelf for those times when I feel like I need them, serve a specialized purpose, or used to be on my Great list until I forgot them for a while and didn't start losing dem gainz.

- Glucosamine, or my tendonitis starts to act up, I'll chomp on some of these. Pretty cheap, and I've heard people talk about using them prophylactically, but they don't fit in my six day pill holder deal, and I'm lazy.

- Melatonin: This one serves a similar role to the ZMA, so I tend only to use it when I know I'm going to have trouble getting to sleep after a long day, or if I know I'm not gonna care that I slept in.

- Psyllium Husk and Acidophilus: When I'm doing a big refeed on CKD, though, 'cause I like to have some time spent outside of the bathroom.

- BCAAs: Right now it's a tub of Optimum Nutrition's unflavored instantized. BCAAs are almost side by side with Creatine for me in that I use the powders with about the same frequency

- Amino Acids: Very similar to BCAAs

- CoEnzyme Q10: I've heard this one is the best thing ever for cardiac health

We've hit the point in the ""Good"" list where most things I list are going to be things I've heard most or all sides argue reasonably convincingly about (Great vs Meh vs Worse than Hitler)

- Rhodiola: The thing that convinced me to give Rhodiola a shot was an article pointing out that it was something my Viking ancestors sought out. (Might have been? I forget the proper wording.) I gave it a shot

- Tribulus terrestris: I heard about this one from Jamie Lewis' controversial blog (Chaos and Pain)

- 5-HTP: Not one I keep constantly on-hand anymore, so if it's on sale I'll usually pick a bottle or two up.

- Fat Burners: When I have them, or if I'm trying to drop weight faster I'll pick some up. They're no magic bullet, but I've always felt like they do have an effect.

- Caffeine: 'nuff said. I keep some caffeine tablets in the car for those days when I'm just dragging ass walking up to the gym.

- Pre-Workout Drinks: They're almost universally carby as all hell, imagine you're drinking an experimental Super-Soldier Serum and let the placebo effect do it's work. &gt;:D

The Ugly/The Misunderstood: There are a number of supplements I've acquired over the years because they were free, and so they're on my shelf waiting, watching...

- Vanadyl Sulfate: This is really the only ""Misunderstood"" on the list, but for the life of me I don't know what it does. And since I end up with white streaks/spots in my poop when I take it, I don't really take it until I forget about that part again.

- Cutting Gel: Yep. I read the ad, so I suppose if you wanted to touch up a vanity spot for a day at the beach or had a photo shoot coming up it could come in handy. Definitely not the wonder stuff they bill it as.

- Resveratrol: Really I'm just kind of bitter that I didn't realize I bought it in liquid form



And that concludes a brief tour of my supplement shelf. I also have protein powders

Stats: Male, 190 pounds last I checked (although that was, like, a month ago.) I started C25K a few months ago, and finished it 2 weeks ago. Since the last week of the program, I've been running a little over 3 miles 3 times a week with the goal of improving my 5K time (currently 32:45.) This week, since I felt like I had the energy/endurance

Before C25K I was entirely sedentary. The only notable movement/exercise I have performed since my loss (started on New Years) are a couple of dance classes (1 ballet,) pilates (classes twice a week) and jiu jitsu (also twice/week.) All of my classes, which were college classes, ended in May and then I started C25K in July-August.

I've been on a standard ketogenic diet since New Years, but across the board. Meals that used to satisfy my hunger for an afternoon leave me feeling peckish 2-3 hours later. I find myself craving carbs/sweets when my hunger peaks.

I've heard advice that running should not be used as a platform for ""I've been running, if this increased movement regimen is affecting my appetite or if others have experienced a similar notable increase. I'm also wondering if this appetite increase is ""proportional"" to the exercise, or if I will need to start keeping tabs on caloric intake and ""going hungry"" for periods of time each day. For the first 6 months of keto, I haven't tracked calories, and followed the ""eat when I'm full"" rule, with lots of success. Does this rule no longer apply when the goal is maintenance/toning?

1375762070.0,1jsgrn,Exercising After Injury Recovery: Advice Needed,envthrow,6,1,11,"Hi Ketogains

First

A little background: 5'11, no idea).  I am down from 290 from last year, and earlier this year in April/May I was 210lb.  In that time, I was working out regularly which included a kickboxing routine and, about half way through, started the 5x5 Starting Strength Program.  Around the end of April, I started getting a lot of pain in my right hip which was diagnosed as bursitis.   It took about 2 and a half months to heal

I wanted to start weight training again but for the time being squats, I could barely sit down for nearly 6 weeks without pain.  The extent of any current exercise I am getting is 45-60 minute road biking sessions, 3 times a week (also trying to get back on the diet wagon, fell off after the injury).  

I am a big dumb weightlifting dummy.   Can the weightlifting vets give me an idea of exercises to work out my legs without putting so much pressure on my hips? Or a routine?  Are machines a better alternatives? Which ones?  One of the reasons I enjoyed SS5x5 was because it was so simple:only 5 exercises.  Are bodyweight exercises a good alternative for the time being(convict conditioning/big six?)?

First, and I can't thank everyone enough. I apologize for the wall of text that follows, but this is my story!

Background: 31M/6'1""/165.6lbs. I've been strict keto for a little over 3 months (I started on 12/26/12). Since then I've lost a tremendous amount of weight. I never thought of myself as *fat* per se more the traditional skinny-fat. That said

I've been on a pretty strict calorie deficit since starting keto; throughout my weight loss I've consistently dropped my daily caloric intake based on recalculated values. That said, irrespective of daily activity. 

I have a feeling this is drastically limiting my progress; both as to fat loss and strength gaining. I've been doing a modified version of SS 3 days a week and cardio every other day. I also mix in ab workouts here and there, and I'm really happy with the progress. I try my best to run fasted.

I've plugged in my values into the ketogains calculator as best I could

It says on non-workout days, do I still want to lose fat?! I really want my gut to go away, and for the first time in my entire life, I can see it! So I'm really hesitant to increase my caloric intake until that happens; that said, I'm willing to listen to you gurus. I'm also a little confused on my macros; but I think if I can figure out the appropriate protein amount, the rest will fall into place. 

So there you have it. That's my story. Opinions? Suggestions? Criticisms? Everything is welcome. Lastly

A bit of intro and why I'm doing keto and what my (very) short term goals are. Also

**Intro:**

New to the board, I really do, but if keto or (ketogains) could net the same results easier (or even better results if only slightly more difficult), then I'm all for that. My own experiences will tell me. 

This is because when I get leaner, then BAM back to 15% again! I'm hoping for something easier to adhere to in the long term so I don't have to rebound all the time.

**Long Term/ 1 month goal**

I'm in that really ~~annoying~~ interesting place where some weeks I look pretty ripped but if I mess up for a few days straight (like now)

I have a cruise in a month and I'd like to get as shredded as possible for that, which I've done before, but it isn't exactly easy to to for a long time. If there's a more relaxed way to drop bodyfat at the same rate, I'm all for that!

My question comes from this statement from Joseph Arcita's guide to ketosis:

&gt; ""1G. One Will Lose Body-fat More Quickly on Keto Than Not ↑
The brain requires or uses rather roughly 20% of daily maintenance energy. Under glycolytic conditions the predominate form in which the brain accepts energy is glucose or glucose derivatives. In other words at least 20% of energy expended daily under a glyclytic metabolism must be taken from dietary or stored glucose. Under fat-adapted ketogenic conditions at least 80% of the energy used by the brain is in the form of (fat-derived) ketone-bodies.

&gt; As well under ketogenic conditions one will sweat

&gt; **Say that a hypothetical person requires 3

Just to clarify

Like

So, that he would be missing out on a 1lbs of fat loss a week?

I apologize if my questions above are nitpicky and redundant

In my case, that would 3 lbs of fat without necessarily being in a deficit.* With a proper deficit going, **I might be able to lose 4 or 5lbs of fat (provided I don't mess up), which is significant.**

Not sure how realistic the above sounds to those with experience

I have zero biology/science background, and on top of that there seems to be so many different workout regimes and I don't know which would be the best for me. I was wondering if someone could point me in the right direction, the right routine or even just general what to do. I can decode acronyms using the table in the sidebar but I don't know what they mean, and when I look them up I don't get straight answers, just more pro words and explanations I don't understand.

I'm a 22 year old dude @ 60kgs, and I'm more interested in gaining muscle and basically improving my appearance. I work in IT so I don't need to be strong for any real reason. In terms of that Apex Predator thing on the sidebar I guess I'm a whiny bitch. I don't have any gym equipment and was hoping to be able to do most of this without any. I don't have any supplements either because they seem to be pretty expensive.

Given all that in mind, could someone bullet-point me a list of things to do, links to check out, or things to watch out for? I've checked out /r/fitness as well but it's similarly complicated at times. If this has been answered somewhere else and I missed it I'm sorry.

I don't keep strict track of my macros but from the MyFitnessPal calculations I do a couple of days per week, and 5% carbs. I've used the Macro calculator and am pretty far under the recommended protein intake for my LBM, though that hasn't prevented me from some great newbie gains. 

So here's my situation:

I've successfully completed the first 12 weeks of the SL5x5 program and the results have been pretty incredible. In addition to SL, and have also considered just upping my protein intake and sticking with the workout. What would you recommend ketogainers?

**TL;DR** I'm plateaued on SL5x5 after 12 weeks, as I really enjoy it. 

**Edit:** changed my ratios so I'm not eating 110%

**Edit 2:** Thanks for all of your help and input guys. After taking in all of this info

- Stay with the SL5x5 program and follow the advice for failing out on the website (I've taken a couple of weeks off so I might drop about 20% from all of my lifts and get a fresh start of sorts).
- Only do HIIT on lift days, I feel out of whack).

started over with keto again like 1 1/2 weeks ago.I dont really need to lose weight
To give you a better overview of my calorie needs i shortly describe my usual day.
I go to work by bike every day(when its not raining)

Thats about ~120k of biking each week.

Monday: 45min abs in the gym at lunch
Tuesday: ~20min yoga @lunch
Wednesday: ~20min yoga @lunch
Friday: 45mins abs at lunch 
Sat/Sun: REST and occasionaly climbing

Under the week it quite varies. I just start this routine now so i might change it again due to not enough rest

The rest of the day i spend sitting on the desk by the way. The reason why i post my training schedule is that i would like to ask you guys how much i actually need to eat.

I quite know WHAT i should eat

My nutrition at the moment:

Breakfast: mostly every day a 10% fat greek joghurt with 2.8 carbs per 150g serving

Lunch: mostly a huge bowl of green salad, cheese, chicken, tuna. The good stuff. I just use olive oil and lime juice for a dressing, sometimes some joghurt one.

Evening: i try to eat there red meat as often as possible. Mostly ground beef mixed with different kind of veggies, or a salad again, lots of nuts in addition and sometimes a bit of wine and cheese and olives. (And sometimes a scoop of peanut butter) :)

Additional to that after training sessions low carb protein shakes for sure.

For snacking i only eat nuts. God i fucking love nuts

I eat at least 100g nuts every day. Can easylie say that

Today i changed my breakfast a little bit as i always got hungry at about 11 o clock already again:
3 slices of bacon, the mentioned joghurt and about 20 pistachios :D
6g of net carbs and 750 calories

I really look forward to get some advice from you guys for my daily calorie intake.

I can manage to stay within the carb range

I am following the 2-meal

Right after workout: 50 grams of Optimum Nutrition Whey

About an hour later: 8-10 oz of chicken grilled in olive oil

Throughout the next 7 hours: 3 sticks of string cheese

Wednesday: Shoulders (Barbel Overhead Press, Front Raise)

I've been on keto for about 1.5 months now. I've dropped 25-ish lbs and doing great. (Down to 260... Woohoo!) I have a sedentary job

Along with weight loss

Here's the glitch... I have to take the CPAT on May 11.

For those of you unfamiliar... the CPAT is the Candidate Physical Abilities Test.

I have to finish all tasks in the test in under 10 minutes and 20 seconds all while wearing a 50lb vest. 20 minutes walking cool down between each event.

Here is the list of tasks:

* Stair Climb - With an additional 25lbs (75 total)
* Hose Drag - Drag an empty fire hose 75ft, pull fore hose in an additional 25ft
* Equipment Carry - Remove two 30lb saws from a 4ft opening and place on the ground. Carry both saws 75 feet
* Ladder Raise and Extension - Raise an aluminum ladder
* Forcible Entry - Use a 10lb sledge hammer to strike a measuring device until a buzzer is activated.
* Search - Navigate a darkened 3ft x 4ft enclosed maze on hands and knees
* Rescue - Drag a 160lb test dummy 70ft
* Ceiling Breach &amp; Pull - Use a pike pull to push up a 60lb ceiling flap three times

So pre-keto... I probably could have done OK with this test.

My concern is I wont be physically ready to take this on.

What is the best way to kick-start this and get me as ready as I can be for May 11? I know I can't be superman, and I can't change it. If I miss it... I could potentially stall my career progress for a year or more... and I don't want to do that.

Granted

What should I do? Losing strength is worse to me than losing size. Do I need to train less often (currently lifting a full 5/3/1 cycle w some BBB and some accessory on a M-W-F-Sun schedule)? Or should I try some TKD?

Overall, and adhering to the diet with few cravings aside from a massive pizza craving. I just hope I don't lose more strength.

1366189302.0,1citwu,After 130lbs weight loss I'm now having serious performance issues - Giving TKD a decent shot - General comments &amp; advice welcome,NoOfficialComment,6,1,13,"Hi guys

I’m giving a TKD approach a decent shot over the next couple of weeks. Have been really struggling trying to find a happy balance between dropping the last of my fat and still performing to any decent level. I seem to be able to do either one or the other which is starting to wear me down. Every time I have competed in the last few years I’ve dropped weight massively to hit the weight class (moved down 4 different divisions in the last 4 years lol) and then I’m basically the walking dead when I actually step out to fight.

First 3 months of 2013 I was doing a lean gains approach which I had properly setup by Andy at rippedbody.jp – Performance was good (eg: added 15Kg to squat

Lately I have tried going back to a keto approach (which is how I lost the bulk of my weight in the first place) but my performance in general has tanked completely from the previous few months. For instance I was deadlifting last week and put 135Kg (just shy of 300lbs) on the bar for a max reps attempt – did 8 reps the last time I tried that…failed after the first rep. Same thing with squats: couldn’t even get 5 reps at 97.5Kg this week

* 28 years old / 5’11”
* Starting weight was 322 lbs
* Current weight is 192 lbs (loss of 130 lbs so far – primarily a combination of Keto &amp; lower carb Paleo). Whole story and some photos is here: http://joshua-palmer.com/bjj-saved-my-life/the-full-story/
* Body fat is somewhere around 20% I reckon though I’ve honestly no accurate idea given that my bio-impedance scales will show anything from 17-23% and I have very loose pliable skin from the weight loss which makes callipers fairly pointless. Also can’t find anywhere nearby where I can get bodpod or dexa which is somewhat frustrating.

* Purple belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu – also training MMA (ends up being 3-4 sessions per week at the moment).
* Lifting 3x week on a 5/3/1 template (through 6 cycles so far). Recent top numbers before completely tanking were: Squat: 242 lbs x 2 / Dead: 330 lbs x 2 / Chins: BW x 8-10 / Bench: 150lbs x 5 (I have absurdly long gorilla arms for my body which makes push motions weak as hell).

Schedule is this:

* Mon: Bench &amp; chins [AM]
* Tue: Rest (do 100 or so push-ups just to tick over)
* Wed: Squats [AM]
* Thurs: Rest
* Fri: Deadlift [AM]
* Sat: Rest
* Sun: BJJ session [AM] if I happen to be around

I have retained the IF eating schedule of 16/8 (2pm-10pm) I got used to with the lean gains approach.

As of this exact moment I am generally staying under 1800-1900 cals on rest days and 2200-ish cals on training days – around 180g Protein/day - no processed food (paleo + dairy framework).

I’m guessing a big part of my problem may be simply nowhere near enough cals on training days?

My TDEE for sedentary is 2250cals (BMR 1800cals) so factor in 2 training sessions on a single day and I’m probably f***ing myself over from the off on those days. When I was doing lean gains

Plan is to stick with these numbers (or adjust with suggestions from you guys obviously) but add 30g manuka honey pre-training.

I really need to find a balance at some point soon – factoring in a whole bunch of fuckarounditis I’ve been cutting weight in some way or another for 5 years now and I’m just starting to get mentally fatigued. I’d really like to get down to around 180-ish lbs as an absolute low and then start bulking. The end goal is to be as strong as possible in the 194lb weight class (BJJ) which would mean walking around at about 190lbs.

sunday: off/light pushups


I do pushups in 3 sets of 25/20/20
I dont do leg exercises because the running I do is taxing enough and I dont want to impact/ruin my chances of running well in my races coming up.

breakfast:

4 eggs

snack:

tablespoon of crunchy peanut butter with a glass of almond milk

weekends are usually a mishmash

I just have a couple questions. ( I have read the links above btw)
Are black beans acceptable? I see that they have a bit of carbs but they also have a decent amount of fiber. I'm a fan of black beans and I think the protein levels are helpful to get me to bodyweight protein levels. Do that have a good place in the Keto diet?
I've noticed a lot of people on here have goals for large scale weight loss. I'm looking to cut maybe 15 pounds over 4 months
Considering my goals, I should consume carbs before and after workouts, and load up on weekends?(assuming I work a regular schedule) If someone could summarize it in the most simple way that would be helpful.

I would like to know why carbs are necessary to gain muscle. 

From what I've read on the sidebar:

- **muscle gain improves with the insulin response.** 

  - So if you were to eat sugar after working out


  -  The article also mentioned that medium-chain triglycerides work just as well


- **glycogen stores are depleted by intense exercise.** 
  
    - In ketosis any moderate or light exercise will use fat.
    - Volek &amp; Finney mention that the longer you use fat for these activities
    - I couldn't find much science
    - Glycogen can be refilled by any type of sugar/carb. The traditional method seems to be CKD/TKD where you go directly to a sugar or carb.
    - Protein should be able to fill the role of replenishing glycogen stores
    - Further more


**TL;DR** : Only high intensity weight-lifting will deplete glycogen stores

 These stores can be refilled by (part of) fat

Muscle growth that is normally stimulated by insulin spikes (via sugars) can be gain through medium-chain triglycerides (coconut oil for example).

**So why are carbs necessary for muscle gain?**

Hello fellow ketogainers.  I've been on a ketogenic diet for a little over 6 weeks now.  Started off with a high protein/low fat but now I'm following a high fat/ moderate protein diet now and sitting ~20g carb/day.

I'm a fairly avid cyclist getting out 2-3 times a week for about 1-2 hours at a time.  I tend to sit around a 15 mph average pace over the whole ride and feel pretty great until the last few miles of my 30+ mile days.  

I used to use these power gels from PowerBar (28 carbs per) but have dropped them in favor of staying more purely keto.  Prior to keto these would help me get over that hump and I was able to complete rides around 50ish miles.

I'm curious if anyone out there that is cycling a good bit (or really any endurance aerobic activity) has any suggestions towards getting past humps like this.  My goal is to go for a century ride sometime around the spring next year (since winter is just around the corner here and I've yet to dare riding in the snow.)

I have been doing SS for about a half a year now. Currently on a cut (SKD + IF) but this is my plan for when I begin building again. I have a science background so even just learning about this stuff is fascinating for me and please dont hesitate to get technical if need be.

First of all on SS

Secondly my SS regime is a touch different. Instead of MWF only

I plan on doing a CKD when I begin again. Just the CKD no IF. 

I understand that you need to fully deplete muscle glycogen/liver glycogen. I felt that SS is kind of limiting in terms of muscle groups worked (ie lats, during these hypertrophy workouts I usually experience failure in one muscle group or another.

I estimate the hitting the wall + 2 hypertrophy-til-failure workouts will be 'intense enough' that CKD is necessary. But currently I just dont know and I am asking the experts. TKD I feel uneasy about since eating shortly before a workout has never made me feel good during the workout.

ANYWAYS

Thanks very much

also for those that are curious:

Hello, and some history, and some blahblah. Thank you for clicking on this post.


I am 30. I'm not a newbie to exercise. It's been a few years, which is on the higher side of the fluctuating range of the plateau from this week.


I was fortunate enough to have a DXA done this past spring, but a hard enough kick in the butt that, with a quantifiable measure, I could stop the screw-around-itis and start making the proper, intelligent changes. A month prior to that I was fortunate enough to have an RMR test done (breather mask, CO2 output against O2 intake, should you know the machine). The test wasn't done bereft of food intake (per necessity, around 6-7 PM


Upon finishing out the semester, but my strength has improved and none of my lifts have suffered. I have no overriding sense of fatigue. My energy levels are fine and have not suffered. My brain works fine, as well - well, read below.


The part of my brain that uses facts knows I'm not eating enough calories. I know my deficit is too extreme


I've read Lyle's articles on the site. I've seen the calculations for maintenance calories. I've downloaded the spreadsheet keto calculator from the sidebar on the - I think it's the - ketogains subreddit sidebar. I've seen all kinds of maintenance calorie calculators via google search. It's all done little to dispel the above


On lifting days (4x/week), there's been a fasted LISS cardio component of around 45 minutes, sometimes twice a day on the non-lifting days, really based on weather. My life is generally fairly sedentary, so if I can get out there and enjoy a sunny day twice a day, I have been.


I know that


Is the proper conclusion I should make be that it's time to move to a full diet break, how do I move up to this level? If so, and in conjunction, how do I safely increase CHO intake so as to not screw up my progress thus far? (I like to assume I've made swell progress these past six weeks. I know I look better, and that's the stupid fatty part of me admitting that, even.)


Again, thank you in advance. And if I've forgotten anything, or there are any questions or variables which need answers and detailing, I will do so as best I can.

I usually (before the injury) run every other day

My goal is to progress from running 5k (which I probably can't do now)

When I say gain strength, as well as just the mental side of things (I know for beginners getting the brain used to lifting can result in a lot of early progress without actual muscle gain). 

**THE QUESTION**

Given my dieting stats and the goals I have
A lot of my goals are cardio based and I'm not sure how running every other day

Additionally will I be able to maintain my muscle

Is there anything wrong with my macros that you would suggest switching? For instance I put ""Lightly active"" even though I am mostly sedentary to account for my workouts.

About two days ago I ate my normal meal, worth of almonts and cashew. Since 1kg of fat hast around 7000-7300kcal this could be around 95g of bodyfat (not likely since I am in a deficit ... so maybe around 200kcal above maintenance).
After I went to the gym I ate my last meal of the day. Accidentally I used alot salt on this meal (normaly I dont use any salt at all) + I made it with feta cheese (which is already pretty salty).
The next day when I woke up I was about 1

I used the keto calculator that was re-done and realize I need to up my calories and can up my carbs to around 50. I really don't care if I'm in ketosis--really just like the low carb for how it makes me feel.

I tried figuring out the SKD / TKD / CKD but I'm confused!

Here's my current routine: 

* Monday: Body pump (60 min weights
* Tuesday: Body combat (60 min. heavy cardio) + CX Worx (30 min. core training)
* Wednesday: sometimes yoga
* Thursdays: Shock training (another 4 weeks
* Fridays: Yoga and running
* Saturday: off
* Sunday: Body combat

So--I don't feel like I'm getting any stronger! I suck at push ups and don't feel my cardio is for shit.

I was at 1300 calories but am now trying to up it to 1700 and am actually finding it hard since I'm used to the keto diet and just not that hungry!

I don't want to burn out my muscles--is my routine okay and I just need to up my calories?

I'm not sure when I should be carbing up or protein-ing up. One person at the gym said carbs 2-3 hours before a workout and then protein after

I don't want to be a weightlifter (but I do lift)--more like Linda Hamilton in the 2nd Terminator or Jessica Biel in Stealth :) I need to be able to do the rope climb and monkey bars.

I have read a lot of the old posts here but I'm just not quite getting it--maybe this is for ""real"" lifters

I used a combination of your two ideas and made weight!   On top of that  I didn't feel like absolute garbage when I competed

Here's the progress:


* Friday Mornings weight: 152.5

* Sat Morning weight: 151.1

* Sunday Morning weight: 149.3

* Monday Morning weight: 150.2

* Tuesday Morning weight: 149.9 (ugh

* Wednesday Morning weight: 148.7 (still some hope! yay)

* Thursday Morning weight : 149.6 (ahhh

* Friday Morning weight :148.5 (152.5 with all my crap

* Saturday Morning weight :148.1 (152.1 with all my crap) BAM!


I used a combination of the two ideas from thebraken and darthluiggi,  not eating till 10 or 11am,  and not eating in the late evening.

Copy/paste from original post:

--------

Hey there fellow Ketoers! I've been on Keto since July of last year

I have a question about TDEE calculators... I'm a server at 2 busy restaurants, but I also don't feel like I quite make the cut for the ""high/heavy"" activity levels. My experiments with eating bear this out, as well. Eating at the calories recommended by the lower levels doesn't fuel me enough for a busy double, and my weight loss stalls out when I eat at the higher calorie amounts.

Oh yeah

If my fellow Ketone producers have any advice for calculations that are more scientific than ""eat between those numbers

First day there was last Wednesday

Went back Saturday and did about an hour on the treadmill

Then Sunday was our first big day. He has done weight training before and put together a three day routine where we do different muscle groups each day (which upon reading the /r/fitness FAQ this morning might not be the best idea). So we hit basically all the back/leg machines. Ended up with 3 sets of 10 on 8 different machines over the course of an hour (which again might have been too fast

But the following morning I was really out of it. Legs/butt were pretty sore, this morning it was back, hard. Legs/butt are more sore than yesterday and arms are worse as well. Felt a little better in the shower but two hours later any more than 100° actively hurts. While my roommate is completely fine.

For the past 3 weeks I've been using MFP I've averaged about 1100 net calories a day while being ""lightly active"" with macros around 60-65% fat 20-25% protein and 10% carbs (which upon reading the /r/ketogains faq is probably a bit off).

So my main question is how much of this has to do with Keto or how I've been eating specifically

 I was making steady strength gains on all my lifts through about a week and a half ago. One of the days I decided to layer 30 minutes of cardio with 3 intervals of HIIT training. This was a bad idea as the next day I was absurdly sore. That lactic acid is burning away muscle sore that leaves you aching while doing everything. Since then I've been resting for the most part. A couple of days ago I played some ultimate in the park with some friends and felt like I pulled my left hamstring. The next morning I felt soreness over much of my legs and felt a muscle strain in my upper back. I've been resting but this morning

Yesterday was my first mentoring session for the CPAT (Candidate Physical Ability Test). The workout is geared towards getting us candidates to pass the actual test. The workouts are two hours long and are comprised of the following:

~15min group warm up (jumping jacks, jump squats, etc)

30mins of running/spints

30mins of weights. They have stations set up with machines/free weights. You start at one station

Going through the CPAT course. This part starts out with a 70lb weight vest and uses a stair mill. There is a 20 second warm up at 50 steps per minute and then the actual test which is 3 minutes at 60 steps per minute. After this 20lbs is removed and you go through the course, lifting things, and hitting things.

15min group cool down/stretch. 


I ended up doing the weight vest part right after warm-up and made it to the 1min 45sec point. I could have kept going but I knew I had two other workouts so I didn't want to kill myself. 

During weights I had to stop for 2-3mins 2/3 of the way through because I felt like I was going to puke. I re-joined the group and completed the workout after that.

The run was, which was moving at a good pace, until a little before the halfway point. At that point I started walking/jogging/running in intervals. The run was probably a mile and a half or so and my legs were already dead. When we finished we did sprints. Probably 150-200 ft. one way, 10sec rest, and back over and over again. I ran until failure. Then it happened. I puked. It was all water of course. 

I had my usual breakfast yesterday of 3 eggs scrambled in coconut oil with some old bay on them, roughly three hours before the workout, which was string cheese, a serving of almonds, some deli ham, a serving of spinach, and a few pork rinds. 

After the workout I had a serving of peanuts in my car on the way home and a serving of pork rinds. I stopped at chipotle afterwards and got a bowl with double chicken/barbacoa, and lettuce. 

The vomiting was just from extreme physical exertion I assume. I drink plenty of water during the day

I am wondering


These sessions are at 6pm on weekdays and 8:30am on weekends. Should I wake up early and eat something before the weekend session or just eat after? 

Due to my work schedule I will be doing this workout once more this week, again on my own etc. until I take my first official test in early May and for the month of May until early June if I can't pass it in May.

This indicates i'm gaining weight. Now, and simply add cardio or cut calories. However, it doesn't make sense given my TDEE and the amount of calories I shoot for, if I underestimate calories it shouldn't be THAT far off that it would put me at a net gain of calories.

Anyway, just drop the calories right? Well, it's not suggested I go below 1900 calories or 142g of fat otherwise my body starts breaking down protein for fuel, as well as simply just not making sense why I would have to go that low. If I gain weight at 2100 cals, that means my TDEE is somewhere in 1800 range, and if I wanted to cut 1lb fat/week that'd have me at 1300 calories.

I was eating around 125g protein and 1700 cals and was not losing (inches and weight) in over a month and was not showing ketones on keto sticks so I lowered cals and protein

I settled for a dumbbell, but ended up laying it on my collarbone after some experimentation, and still found it very uncomfortable and awkward.

I am grateful there are supportive communities out there for what we be doin'. Jeebus bless the interwebs!

Backstory:

Started keto in May of last year when I moved jobs at my work (due to a back injury) from one that was physically intensive to one that had basically no physical activity at all, but I'd like to weigh about 225 in my perfect fantasy world.

In September I got put on forced medical leave because they could no longer accommodate my injury, but after a month became pretty aggressive, except where I am limited because of my bulging disc (squat, deadlift, row). I do a preworkout (c4, jack3d, acg3, then a postworkout protein with creatine and lately milk

All my lifts have consistently gone up (but my bench is low and will not seem to improve), I did notice more energy at the gym, but also the normal grogginess and indigestion that comes when I get back on the loaf. This leads me to believe I need to do TKD or CKD for optimal gains.

So

* I bought some dextrose at the supplement shoppe, but that worries me as I seem to drop out of keto really easily, I might be a pre-diabetic sort of guy. What's the SOP for pre/postWO carbs?


* How do I increase my bench? I started at 135 and have gotten up to maybe 165 on a good day which seems pretty pathetic for the 6 days a week 90 minutes I've been putting in for months. My chest is definitely bigger but the strength is just not there. I've tried:
Lifting heavy (2-3 reps then fail
Lifting for reps (burning out 135)
Dumbbells
Machines
I've got pretty long arms, ketogains?


A couple more questions that the bros argue about:

* Also this a common topic at the gym with seemingly no resolution but what is your guys' opinion on heavy leg days increasing test --&gt; more gains?


* Lifting to failure. What think ---&gt; ""Leave one in the tank""? or burn'em?

Alright guys I appreciate your help in advance.

1.	From what I gather, but why? Why even bother? From what I gather, it seems more like a glorified low-carb diet. Muscles love glucose for fuel, and as long as you are not putting more in than burning, there should be no fat gain. I fully agree with the keto philosophy that it is carbs and not fat that causes weight gain, which is what my diet reflects. Even before knowing what keto was, my breakfast was 3 eggs, and half an avocado. Lunches I try to stay around 20g of carbs


2.	As someone who regularly does high intensity training, would it be to my detriment? What is 


3.	Finally, how does kissing someone in keto taste? Is the whole keto breath thing that noticeable? This just seems like a weird quirk of the program that might affect someone you’re with. I can’t imagine acetone tastes good…

Lunch: Salad/Meat + veggie/lettuce wrapped burger

Dinner: Chicken wings/Eggs+Bacon+Burger/Steak/Sausages

snack: almonds/peanuts/85% dark chocolate/chocolate mousse (cocoa+avocado+coconut oil+heavy cream)

I drink Kombucha(fermented tea (5-6g of carbs/8oz)) sometimes after workouts and coconut water when I'm hungover (14g of carbs/8oz). Just stopped drinking diet soda regularly yesterday. 

Alcohol: Thursday (3-4 drinks), or tequila + soda, the occaisional dark beer.

Cheats: I get kim chi fries after drinking / indian food after working out sometimes.

1. Should I be cutting more calories? I estimate ~2000 cals on workout days and 1400-1700 on off days. I don't seem to be losing fast enough despite feeling completely drained at the end of workouts.

2. Should I consciously up my fat intake? My fat intake is not as high as the recommended 65%, and then chug heavy cream to compensate. How can I up my fat intake?

3. I sometimes carb up by eating some chocolate or fruit before a workout, I felt fine, but my early lifts wouldn't be as high.

4. I lost the most (and felt great)when I ate a lb of steak + heavy cream based sauce at 3pm

5. Should I switch to a CKD/TKD if I want to cut more and retain muscle mass? I don't want to gain much more muscle (I'm reaching the limits of my work shirts) till I get a little bit of the fat off my upper arms and shoulders.

Here's my intended approach and justification behind it. I'd be interested to hear *if* it's wrong

***Pre***  
Butter or coconut oil. Straight. 25-30g. Why? Because [it's an MCT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12-4OoCg1pciaHyJnMqfar67Y1ag55QaY8rm7vfhPr-4/edit?pli=1#heading=h.b4hqw266wy68) with high caloric yield in a dense dietary form which can start being utilised in &lt; 30 mins. It will give me plenty of readily accessible fuel to see me through a workout to exhaustion. No insulin will be produced as a result of consuming this food. 2-3 cups of strong black coffee to help with focus and physical activity
  
Meat and lots of green vegetables. No *added* fat

The goal isn't necessarily to use these timed 'meals' for weight loss but more as an aid for a good workout. It looks water tight to me and I tried it today

How can I improve this? Why is(n't) it a bad idea?

* I'm male, 6'3"" (1.9m)
* ~30% body fat based off mid-day hydrated impedance testing varying between 27-32
* I did read the FAQ and I searched for this topic
* I had a stall roughly 2 months into keto, for the last month.
* I've been doing keto for just a few days short of 3 months now.

**Diet**

* Diet averages 1400-1700kcal per day with a 35/65/5 Protein/Fat/Carb macro. I don't track like I used to since I eat almost exactly the exact same thing every single day

**Supplements**

* I take an array of supplements including a (likely overkill) multivitamin, magnesium/potassium, zinc, and some nootropics.

I'll start by thanking all of you for existing. /r/keto is the reason I've lost 35lbs so far, and keeping the protein in a narrow range window.

So now that I feel like I have a handle on the diet itself without any qualms or cravings I've decided to start adding in exercise. I have a gym membership that's quite nice, I think it's because I have body image issues and there's not a single gym around me that's not full of incredible looking people (yes, I've gym shopped). I realize that most of these people don't give a damn about me, and if anything are impressed that I'm trying, but even with me actively telling myself that...it's still difficult to muster the willpower to go in there. 

In short

Accordingly I've purchased a resistance band set. The set I have ([viewable here](http://amzn.com/B003VPLWTO)) has the following bands:  Yellow Band (2-4 pounds), Black Band (15-20 pounds), Red Band (25-30 pounds) and Orange Band (35-40 pounds). Unfortunately I wasn't aware of all the nuances in resistance bands and did not order one where you can combine the bands together; however, my current strength levels are so low that it's likely these bands will be worn out before I reach a strength level necessitating more resistance.

I did my first workout with these bands tonight. Not knowing how to proceed I just used the included guidebook to get started. I used the blue band (4-6 lbs) and did sets of 12, and 6 of each of the following exercises in the order they're presented in.

* Band squats (used 10-12lb Green band here)
* Band curls (used 10-12lb Green band here)
* Band lunges (could not complete a set of 12 on either leg with blue band)
* Lateral raise
* Tricep pulldown
* Squatted Row
* High chest press
* Kneeling crunches
* Chest body pull

I realize that there's likely already advice out there that describes a good resistance band exercise, and most critically, my many failed past attempts at fitness were because I was constantly reading some new tip from some muscle building site on how to do X or Y more efficiently - and I just ended up feeling frustrated.

To give an idea on that frustration: at one point I was working out 5 days a week doing weights MWF (cardio TR) for 2hrs each time with high-rep workouts on a medium carb

So this time I'm asking for advice.
