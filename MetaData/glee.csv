Jake: super cute, fights for the girl and although he's a little dense in knowing what Marley wants, he's perfect. He got over his anger problems and now addresses social concerns perfectly and always comes around in the end. He was Noah done right. 

Noah still makes me cringe

1373940072.0,1idtkv,**[OFFICIAL] Cory Monteith Rumors**,aggfan9,125,14,17,"I thought I'd make a master thread for these since there's so many going around. There were a few that I wanted to address up front that I know for a fact aren't true. Please
Let's get started-

**Rumor #1:** A popular rumor is that this [picture](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BPKHemTCEAEHvyQ.jpg) is of Lea Michele grieving over Cory Monteith's casket. Although it seems like it could be legit considering the similarities in the woman shown and Lea's appearance, it was confirmed that this picture was featured in a [news article](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BPJ11zkCMAEWj79.jpg) mid 2012 featuring the wife of a fallen soldier.

**Rumor #2:** Another rumor going around is that ""Lea and Cory were supposed to get married in two weeks"" -- usually attached to this [picture.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BPKRNXnCYAACjoe.jpg) There were reports released after Cory last got out of rehab that they had a future planned together, the colors on the card don't match up exactly. Also, that picture was taken at an awards show in 2010 before they had started dating.

**Rumor #3:** There is a rumor going around on Twitter that this [picture](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BPIBgRcCIAAJ4Tq.jpg) (WARNING. THIS PICTURE MAY BE EMOTIONALLY CHARGED FOR YOU. DO NOT CLICK IF IT COULD BRING UP BAD FEELINGS) was the ""last picture taken"" of Cory. However, the last picture taken and published of Cory was by his mother on her [twitter](https://twitter.com/slimyagent/status/355530966191718401/photo/1) on July 11th.

**Rumor #4:** Cory Monteith died of an overdose. This is the biggest rumor out there. There's no doubt that it could've in fact been an overdose due to the fact that he had been battling drug abuse and had gone to rehab multiple times, ""there was nothing to indicate Monteith's death was due to illicit drug use."" ""Foul play"" has also been ruled out of the equation. The toxicology tests are still being run, but as of now, no legitimate report of the cause has been released yet. 

Not completely sure of how reliable this [article](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2364549/Cory-Monteith-planning-girlfriend-Lea-Michele-death--Canadian-police-reveal-indicate-death-drugs.html) is

Hopefully this helped some of you guys and cleared up some false information that's being spread around! As I said before

1) All of the teachers were running towards the door and slamming them shut! If the shooter is right outside your door, at the same time, know that they don't just run madly down the hall: get into the nearest open door immediately! I was disgusted when doors were slammed *as kids were running right in front of them*.


2) Principal Figgins had a duty as well, and whatever... but that is never true in a crisis like this, and especially not for a principal, who must be responsible for everyone in the building. 


3) I was horrified when Schuster actively encouraged the Glee club members to whip out their phones and text everyone and anyone. During a lockdown crisis, ringing... a vibrating cell phone could have gotten Marley's mother killed. Furthermore, imagine a thousand cell phones trying to send out a text message or a phone call; the cell phone network is liable to crash, preventing actual important calls from going out.


4) Doors should be locked... check. Window blinds should be covered... check. Windows on doors should be covered... check


5) Students should not just hide behind things... Students should be seated in an area away from the line of sight of any windows or doors


6) Do not under any circumstances let students out, then we get to #7...


7) I was almost *screaming* when I saw Schuster on the other side of the stall door in the bathroom. ""No one leaves"" most definitely includes teachers. I'm sorry, or 10 in the bathroom. But Schuster is responsible for the students in the Glee club practice room, and he put those kids in danger twice - first by leaving, and second by returning and knocking, thereby forcing students to question whether it's really him on the other side of the door or not. And if it was really a gunman, it won't matter whether the students lifted the paper taped to the door window, or just opened it wide without checking.


8) Finally, no moving around, no video confessions... 

Before anyone argues that it was a time of crisis and teenagers will be teenagers and may panic

I'm only addressing this comment toward your criticism of the school shooting episode.

I have been in a school shooting situation in high school. For me

The way Glee portrayed that situation had me in tears. I arrived to school one day and was rushed into the open gymnasium. It was so chaotic that no one even knew who or where the shooter was. At one point the police and Vice Principal (along with National Guard members) came into the gym looking for the shooter there.

The point is: the way the story was portrayed, and people I didn't particularly like, were huddled together in fear. Some were crying, while some were still confused. We were texting anybody and everybody (this was in 2005, before social media was what is is today). 

I can 100% relate to the characters on the show. I can relate 100% to the way it was portrayed in subsequent episodes as well. Yes

I have been watching Glee for many years

I've had friends become pregnant

Glee is a show that tries its best to emulate what is going on in the world. I wish more than anything it was around when I was in high school

All of the characters on this show portray people I can relate to

I strongly, then that's how they feel comfortable.

Point is: we are NOT the ones most affected by this absolute tragic situation. Yes Glee and Fox are businesses, Lea Michele, and every other cast member that considered him family, will make the best decision. And whatever they choose to do, we as fans have to respect that.

These people are not only wonderful people, and some even on Broadway.

Don't judge them by one or two episodes

RIP Cory Monteith.",self,t5_2royn,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/glee/comments/1ie0rd/ive_seen_a_lot_of_hate_recently_about_how_glee/

So. Make Rachel the understudy for Funny Girl

Meanwhile, but he's a prick and people don't like working with him. So Santana, being the fame whore that she is, sees an opportunity. She recruits Rachel and Kurt and the three of them join the project.

Anyways

Until Rachel melts down mid-season. They've been facing minor difficulties up to this point- funding, sabotage, but the project has been going ok. But Rachel finally snaps from all the pressure of her role as understudy and all the classes she's doing poorly in. She quits the movie and drops out of school to ""pursue her career"". 

Meanwhile, but maybe after a while he hits a ceiling. Realizes in the second half of the season that he's never going to be the powerhouse that can land the really big roles and has to shift his focus. Personally I liked the idea of Kurt in fashion. 

Santana can flounder. Maybe she can start sleeping with guys again after her split from Brit and go through some self doubt. Maybe she just wants to be famous again. I'm a fan of making Santana a bit of a mess before she figures it out and starts to hustle. 

The point is, with no idea what they're doing, really. Trying to figure out if these dreams are worth gambling their lives on, trying to figure out who they are on their own, trying to figure out how to build on what they learned in high school instead of clinging to it and refusing to leave that shelter. 

Have a plot. A SEASON-LONG plot. Dreaming this up took about as long as typing it, please, writers. Don't forget stuff. Don't go for the cheap laugh. Figure out a midseason and a season-long plot for each character. Then tie them together. Then use each episode to do a plot of the week AND advance the big story. 

I legitimately thing this show could be rescued pretty easily if the writers showed some self control and made a good plan. They have some fantastic talent and characters that we have huge emotional attachment to already. Take advantage of it.

1368168660.0,1e218s,That was the finale?? (Spoilers for the finale and the season inside),Mottaman,63,6,14,"That was one of the worst season finale's for a show I have ever seen. But what was I really expecting when the show has been all over the place for the majority of the season.

1)Ok so Brittney is at MIT, especially since just last week Kurt looked at a calendar for APRIL. But in the Glee world I guess we learned last year, you dont get your college acceptance letters until after graduation.

2) Oh look

3) Rachel sings.... has about 3 min of camera time with no actual plot movement... but heaven forbid we dont feature a song from Lea Michele in the finale

4) Lets build up the catfish story very slowly over like 6 episodes

5)Didn't Finn rejoin New Directions like 3 episodes ago to help lead them to regionals? Didn't he and Will make up? Doesn't he and Puck live like a stones throw away since he goes to a community college in Lima? Where was he last week when his step father got his cancer news?

6)What happened to Becky? Last we saw of her she was telling Figgins something secret

7)Wasnt there a whole episode a couple of years ago about how they need 12 kids to perform? In the hours leading up to the performance neither Ryder or Brittney were confirmed to show up. Maybe they could assume Ryder would be a good guy but at that point in the episode there was no reason for them to know Brittney would show up and they were surprised that she did. Without her they were 11 and would have been DQed.
Hell just about the only thing about the episode that was done right was actually having Mike Chang and Mercedes backstage during the performance since they were coaching

Then the wedding, no consistency, no focus. It tried to make about a million stories but instead of focusing on a few at a time and giving them conclusions it just felt like the episodes were out of order. The cast is too big and they need to either make NYC a spinnoff or kill the HS at this point. The first couple of seasons worked because you only had a few main characters. You had Rachel, Finn, Schu and Kurt. Quinn and Sue were secondary and everyone else basically sang in the background. Stories were told, they had a beginning a middle and an end and people were happy. Now you have 20 people fighting for screen time and its just a mess.",,self,,

The show has heavily implied that Kitty is Katie. I don't buy it.

Some things Ryder mentioned:

* Unique. The ringtone he called was not the same as Unique's ringtone has been. Unique could have a different ringtone for each number

* Brittany already has Sam  
* It's not Jake  
* Marley would make sense plot wise
* I think it could be Blaine. The camera focused on Blaine after Ryder sent the text ""Where are you?""

My issues: Why hadn't Ryder called this mystery person before

If I heard him correctly

If Ryder has all the phone numbers of the Glee Club

Edit: Blaine has been crushing on Sam but that plot line could be over and/or he could be crushing on more than one person at once. 

Other options

* Tina. This is a very viable option and I hadn't considered it before. Tina is lonely and wants some sort of appreciation. This appreciation/loving could be met through online dating. Also

* Becky. Possible but her character already has too much going on. /u/obsidianpanther

* Sue. Possible but unlikely. She did show up outside the choir room at 3:30 and she is just evil and cunning enough to do this sort of thing

* Coach Beiste. She had been doing some online dating as well this episode

I know it sounds far-fetched, well, everyone's jumping onto the ""Who's Katie"" thing, I figure I'd contribute. 

No one has ever seen Katie. No one has ever talked to Katie or heard Katie speak. Katie doesn't text anyone else in the club besides Ryder.

I rewatched 4x16, as mentioned in the other Katie thread by SilverTongie. In the second conversation, Katie asks Ryder about Marley:

&gt;Katie: What about Marley? Arent you still crushing on her?

&gt;Ryder: I'm starting to feel like maybe I've kind of moovd on...

&gt;Ryder: So...

&gt;Ryder: Can we meet?

&gt;*Katie is now offline.*

Then, no Jake. This is the moment where Marley lies because she's terrified of telling him in front of Jake, then realises she has gone way too far.

Two scenes after that

&gt;Katie: Hey.

&gt;Ryder: What do u want?

&gt;Katie: Please don't be mad.

&gt;Ryder: Of course i'm mad

&gt;Ryder: You've been lying 2 me this entire time (Can I point out how weird it is for someone to use apostrophes AND number substitutions in the same text?)

&gt;Katie: Only about my name and my pic.

&gt;Ryder: Then who the hell r U?

&gt;Katie: I'm just someone who wanted to get close to U.

&gt;Katie: Someone shy

It goes on. Here's the important line: ""Please don't be mad."" How would Katie know Ryder was mad at her

Next, unlike the other characters, shows no surprise in her face when the phone rings, just dread. She's the first person to repeat Beiste and tell Ryder to cancel the call, responding so fast she's almost waiting for an excuse to say it. As he cancels it, she is trying not to break down. 

So, and her reactions in the choir room... is it settled?

Second, they don't talk about it because if it were common knowledge then everyone would do it, but do you really think that no admissions decision ever gets changed? Especially the ones left up to the discretion of an individual? It's like getting a job- a lot of times when they tell you no and that you don't meet qualifications, if you just keep calling anyway you stand a decent chance of getting hired. Or getting a restraining order taken out against you. Either way, a lot of the time what matters most is being willing to WANT something enough to ignore how many times you've been told ""no"". 

Third, but he's not actually in her league. For someone with that much raw ability, sometimes a school will take a chance even though it's established that she screwed up before. It's like when schools ignore a 2.8 GPA because someone got a 36 on the ACT. It totally sucks for the person who busted their ass all through school to earn a higher GPA and maybe isn't as naturally brilliant, but from the school's perspective sometimes it's better to take a risk to get a genius rather than going with the safe option that will always be solid but might not ever be the very best.

Fourth, I don't think anyone can argue that he actually worked harder for this than Rachel. Hate her if you want, call her a Mary-Sue, but you can't argue that her character works very very hard for the things she then assumes she deserves. And hearing over and over that a person so talented is also that passionate and driven would be enough to give an admissions officer pause, I think, even though Rachel choked.

Finally, but then was able to persevere and convince the judge that her sheer vocal ability made her a good risk. Kurt did well, but at the end of the day his vocals weren't enough to get him in. And since we have no idea what the competition is like, there's no way to know if he should have gotten in- all can do is assume that the vocal bar was set somewhere in between where the two of them perform.

* I have never known a university teacher to be so involved in the life of a first year student. First years drop out all the time. It takes years of work to be worthy of this much attention.

* Rachel is downright rude to Cassandra just about every class. Yes Cassandra has an attitude but a dancer learns to take it. Dancers never tell dance teachers that they know everything and give career guidance to the teacher

* I don't understand why Cassandra would even be bothered by Rachel. Yes Rachel is rude but Cassandra could just victimise her in class. Clearly Rachel is worse than everyone in the room

* Rachel never seems to be paying attention to her technique in dance classes. She is either too busy talking, I don't understand why she isn't focusing on becoming better in dance classes.

With that said, and tends to stick to rap and classic rock where he can hide some of his singing flaws. Don't get me wrong, Cory is a good singer and a phenomenal actor, and in many instances it is hinted that Finn has little classical training... But they joke about his dancing all the time and use that as a point of character development... But then his singing is okay and he's the undisputed lead male except for that one time with Jessie or Blane (both of which are so mind blowingly fantastic at singing, but still lose to Finn). But still, his place is never really challenged by some of the group male powerhouses, like Puck, and Rachel's talent is absolutely mind blowing. Why hide Finn's singing rather than using it as character development? When I say hide I mean similar to Gerard Butler's phantom. He did a great job as someone who just learned singing

Also, were Rachel had a full vocal range... And again, this could have been something addressed on the show. They join glee to learn, not just to show their talents. Not to mention, why have him sing women's songs so much when there are tons of interesting tenor music out there... Like phantom, prince, etc. I would have much preferred to see some of the other female singers on the show sing these songs. Kurt grows so much in so many different ways,,False,t3_1kcyhg

**Characters:**


*Previous characters:*

As for previous characters on the show, this the current status update. Sugar (Vanessa Lengies), Sam (Chord Overstreet) and Joe (Samuel Larsen) are all confirmed to be coming back. Rory (Damian McGinty) is confirmed to not be coming back for at least the first half of the season, with a possibility of coming back in the second half.

Wade/Unique (Alex Newell)

*New regular/recurring characters:*

There are also descriptions of new characters that will be coming into the mix. Puck’s younger brother will be joining the scene. There are also descriptions for a pretty female high school student (assumed to be at McKinley) and a 20 year old male (assumed to be with one of the graduates, blonde” cheerleader with great dance moves.

Also two actresses

There is also at least the confirmed spot on the show for the Glee Project Season Two winner

*Guest roles:*

There are some actors and singers attempting/planning on making appearances throughout the season. Matt Bomer and Gloria Estefan are both willing/wanting to reprise their roles as Cooper Anderson and Maribel Lopez

Adam Levine is in discussions for a guest spot on the show and Jessica Sanchez (American Idol Season 11 runner-up) is in discussions for a multi-episode arc.

Cheryl Cole is rumored to be making a cameo this season according to Jane Lynch.

**Overarching Plot:**

There are some overall plot themes/devices that will be implemented throughout the whole season.

Many have been wondering how detrimental/balanced the split between the graduates and the high schoolers will be. It was said that the split will be very much like the split in season two between McKinley and Dalton when Kurt was at Dalton. The club will return to underdog status due to loss of many of their members and scrambling to get new ones. 

The season is said to be more pop-culture based and more mature. There will also be fewer characters than ever according to Ryan Murphy

**Character Plot:**

*Couples/Teams:*

Will and Emma will not be married right away

Will and Sue will no longer be enemies and will befriend one another

Finn and Rachel’s relationship will set the scene for the beginning of season four.

*Character Specific:*

Sue has already had her baby by the time the season starts

Rachel will be featured in most if not all the episodes of this upcoming season. She has been confirmed to sing in the first two episodes

Finn may be heading to army boot camp; it is still unconfirmed where his character is going exactly.

Kurt at first will be in Ohio still, but not NYADA.

Santana is going to the University of Louisville.

*Episode Specific:*

The second episode of the season will be a tribute episode to Britney Spears. There is said to be a stage catastrophe and lots of Brittany’s character being displayed.

I've always worked with teenagers in different support settings (shelters, given how big a part music often plays in their lives.  'Course, not gay but falling into some other ostracized minority

So I'd like to try a rewrite, but ultimately this isn't actually a work of fanfic so much as catharsis for ""Damnit Glee, you missed such a golden opportunity with this.""  But rather than try and rewrite the whole series, I thought it might be a little easier to handle to just start over from S4, same basic characters (though some personality tweaking seems fair).  My basic ground rules were:

1) Mental health issues should be portrayed accurately insofar as they not needlessly triggering or complicated to the audience.  No need to spew the whole textbook diagnosis at them

2) Generally, and mixed feelings while the *adults* should be fairly straightforward, even simplistic (""the mean teacher"", ""wise janitor"", ""crazy secretary"").  The ""cool parents exception"" probably comes in as they start to cross over with their kids - parents shouldn't divorce for frivolous reasons, and that complexity is welcome if the story revolves around it.  If it's truly a show for teenagers, it makes the kids more relatable, because sometimes the actors seem to really hate their characters.  That also demands a little empathy, things will get better

3) The music sequences don't necessarily have to reflect fact and fit into the plot.  In fact, incidentally?).  Most importantly, though, every couple of episodes or so, I think it's particularly important that someone do a song that expresses how they feel **in a way they aren't able to express normally**.  Music was really resonant for me as a teen because it was like, ""Oh gawd yeah that's EXACTLY how I feel!"" or ""Yeah, this song is SO me.""  That's probably why teens feel so connected with the artists behind the songs too, and open the door to bring in some super expressive but sometimes agonizing songs, she did all that horrible stuff because she hated herself?""*).

I think they're in line to make a more long-term plot arc and actually stick to it. A lot of shows experience a lack of plot after the storyline they start with has to end. The whole point of the show was to get to nationals and win and graduate and move on. Season 3 finished up that main idea and now they're lost but knowing they'll be around for 2 more years gives them an opportunity to develop a strong long-term plot without the fear of being cancelled.

Unfortunately

The other top reason I'm excited for Glee in the future is because they're changing the pace (the kids just finished regionals as a season finale, then have another 10-12 weeks on. I'm honestly just excited for anything that keeps the plot on a timeline and helps the writers build to something ACTUALLY happening rather than the jumbled plot mess that season 4 was.

It's always bothered me that Tina hasn't really ever had much of a storyline (and the fact that they've started making jokes about it sort of irritates me), but it would've given her a storyline, created an interesting relationship between her and Artie, and would've made her relationship with Mike (a DANCER) really interesting.

So I just was listening to Don't Stop Belevin' the original version from the pilot and thought that it would be cool to rewatch the scene.

The feelings that I just re-experienced were amazing. I got goosebumps and an exciting feeling in my stomach recapturing all that this scene gave me before. It showed me a show that could understand what it was like to be shit out of luck and not know which way to turn. To feel like you had all this wishing and wanting and exuberance for something greater but no way to bring it forth into success. I remember that this show has shown me great things. It has shown me that there is no way in hell any one should give up on themselves for any reason. There is always a way to pick yourself up and put forth all you have out for the world to see. 

I know that it's easy to pick apart the show recently because of the botched writing, is that sometimes, this show can be inspirational, and that even if it inspires one person to move forward, to not look back, to not give up on themselves, to seek support, then it has served a great purpose.

Obviously we would love for it to be a better piece of art/writing as well and we fondly look back on it as a great show that could've been greater than it is, there is a reason it is in his head in the first place.

I was just thinking about what songs I would like to hear on the show if they do do a tribute episode. Personally I would love it if the songs from the tribute episode were done entirely live. The cast deserves the chance to sing completely honestly about the man that worked next to them for years. To hear processed and auto-tuned vocals on these songs would really upset me- and I can't imagine how they would feel.

Also I strongly feel that the original ND should all be back for his. Maybe even Dijon Talton. I know he didn't sing or talk much on the show, Mark Salling, Amber Riley, Harry Shum Jr, and Heather Morris are able to pay tribute then I really doubt I would even consider watching.

There are two songs from Spring Awakening that I feel like would be really really perfect, and so appropriate for this. One the other, that's asking a lot of Lea especially considering her personal relationship with both these songs and Cory, to tie yet another part of her life to the tragedy here.


**[Left Behind](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBX6Rvd831c)** - sung by Will
[Lyrics](http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.metrolyrics.com%2Fleft-behind-lyrics-spring-awakening.html&amp;h=wAQFrDf5r)

This is actually about a young man that committed suicide



**[Those You've Known](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wlq_9JyBvC8)** - Main part sung by Rachel with the rest of the original ND members doing the background parts
[Lyrics](http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.metrolyrics.com%2Fthose-youve-known-lyrics-spring-awakening.html&amp;h=wAQFrDf5r)

This song is about finding the resolve to move forward after losing someone incredibly important to you



The other songs that I would possibly like to hear:

**[My Heart Will Go On](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNIPqafd4As)** - sung by Rachel
[Lyrics](http://www.metrolyrics.com/my-heart-will-go-on-lyrics-celine-dion.html)

This one is pretty obvious. I actually prefer the Spring Awakening songs, and Rachel always does beautiful covers of Celine Dion songs.



**Don't Stop Believing** - sung as an acoustic number by the group

I don't think you guys need links or lyrics for this one. And I know it's been done a lot of Glee- but if any song really defines the show, emotional version would be pretty much the ultimate way to commemorate Finn.



Those were the ones that immediately came to mind for me. I'd be interested in hearing what other people think. 

***And I'm sorry if it's weird that I'm posting about the show right now. Obviously the real tragedy here is that someone who by all accounts was a great guy has died. But as weirdly guilty and horrible as I feel about it, and I'm not sure how to process it.",,False,self,t5_2royn,1373863198.0,,
