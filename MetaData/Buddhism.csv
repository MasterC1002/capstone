1354658024.0,14a8nc,The premise of Buddhism in simple English:,phillydrew,1133,200,206,"A friend of mine once asked about what Buddhism was all about. I wrote this up for him. Hope you get a few laughs.

There was this guy named Buddha. He realized that people can be really selfish and sometimes really stupid. They get upset because their lives are really sucky and all they did was blame other people for their problems. He felt bad and tried to figure it out. Aside from the inevitables like, illness, and death, he figured out there was a way to not be so affected by the situations that life presented. He presented four absolute (noble) truths and 8 ways to realize them.

**4 noble truths:**

1. life can suck.

2. it sucks because we get attached to the stuff that we imagine makes
     our selves ""unique"" and ""special.""

3. There is a way to not be affected by the suckness.

4. If we open our eyes and follow eight simple methods
      we can be freed from letting the suckness affect us.

**8 fold path:**

1. No one is absolute nor omnipotent. We're all pretty ignorant.


2. If you don't learn to stop and say
      in a way that's going to free you from the suckness.


3. Don't open your mouth without considering wtf it's going to
     sound like to the person on the receiving end.


4. You're not the center of the universe. Your actions not only affect everything around
     you
     Don't do stupid shit that's going to hurt other people or yourself.


5. Don't take action that's going to make life suck for other people at your benefit.


6. If something pisses you off


7. Know the consequences of your actions
     Moreover
     When you make a mistake (you will), and be open to remedy yourself
     and the situation. And when in a group take care to not act unless it benefits the group in someway.


8. If you don't pay attention to the task at hand you're going to have a bad time.

There is a natural process at work that WILL reduce the quality of content of any rapidly expanding subreddit without action. As a 6+ year reddit user
If we don't make a decision now about the kind of community we want to have here, and it's starting to run away from us as we speak.

**Why and how does this process happen?**

Meme comments by their nature attract upvotes easily, inspire an 'in joke' sort of feeling (if you're cool and get it, you upvote). We'll call this LOW-EFFORT CONTENT. Longer, more insightful comments, the kind that makes this one of my favorite subreddits, take longer to read, you don't always agree with them

So to begin with, they can still rise to prominence, because it's just easier to read and upvote them.

Second, every time. It sucks, but that's how it is. So you have to make a choice about which you would rather have.

As a subreddit gets diluted with more new users, and valuable contributors become discouraged and stop contributing as much. Once they start gaining a toehold, people writing and reading mind-expanding comments are going to look elsewhere, and as the size of the subreddit expands people will spend more time contributing memes, because that's what works. All of a sudden you have a crap subreddit.

It's a really poisonous process that has ruined many a subreddit. What we have learned is that unless you have a very clear vision of the kind of subreddit you want to have, because they insist that only science gets posted in /r/askscience, and anything that isn't gets removed. Their achievement is really quite incredible. Almost 250,000 users and every article and comment is thought-provoking, intelligent and on-topic.

**I hereby propose that only thought-provoking

It's why I come here. This is subjective and obviously needs discussion, jokes, pictures, etc as the primary content in this subreddit, with interesting stuff being mostly relegated to the sidelines. It WILL happen soon. It's just a matter of time. The process really starts to pick up speed around 25,000/30,000 subscribers.

**Moderators

1365046539.0,1bmzs6,"""a man who fears suffering is already suffering from what he fears""",buddhaiuniverse,357,34,37,"-Michel de Montaigne

The moment your mind takes control of your present state of consciousness and begins to think about worries and fears of the future

This is the thought process the ego feeds and thrives on, that we should be in harmony with. Live in the present moment, be aware of every second that ticks, and react to what is around you. This is what Bruce Lee, along with Tao and Buddhist practitioners mean when they say ""be like water"". Water conforms or reacts with its immediate environment instantly, and yet as calm and timid as it may seem, it is more importantly the most efficient reaction.

As we live our daily lives, you have escaped the present moment of experiencing the bird's flyby, and you have ventured into a world of illusion, one of thought form where past and future is falsely exalted. Your path itself is an ongoing quest, unfolding itself to you after each moment that passes. Be in tune with the present moment and watch your life reach success with efficiency and contentment.

Saturday
Dharma Cloud Temple
Plum Village

Dear Adam

Let me start by saying that I wish for you to find peace. It would be easy just to call you a monster and condemn you for evermore, delusion and fear—yes, above all else, I think, fear—you thought that killing was a way out. It was clearly a powerful emotion that drove you from your mother's dead body to massacre children and staff of Sandy Hook School and to turn the gun in the end on yourself. You decided that the game was over.

But the game is not over, in the violation of their trust, in the gaping wound in a community, and in the countless articles and news reports spilling across the country and the world—yes, you live on even in me. I was also a young boy who grew up in Newtown. Now I am a Zen Buddhist monk. I see you quite clearly in me now, continued in the legacy of your actions, and I see that in death you have not become free.

You know, and we won our division that year. My mom still keeps the trophy stashed in a box. To be honest, I was and am not much of a soccer player. I've known winning, but I've also known losing, and being picked last for a spot on the team. I think you've known this too—the pain of rejection, isolation and loneliness. Loneliness too strong to bear.

You are not alone in feeling this. When loneliness comes up it is so easy to seek refuge in a virtual world of computers and films

I want to know what you did with your loneliness. Did you ever, shrouded by beech and white pine. It makes up the landscape of my mind. I remember well the thrill of heading out alone on a path winding its way—to Treadwell Park! At that time it felt like a magical path, one of many secrets I discovered throughout those forests, some still hidden. Did you ever lean your face on the rough furrows of an oak's bark, feeling its solid heartwood and tranquil vibrancy? Did you ever play in the course of a stream, making pools with the stones as if of this stretch you were king? Did you ever experience the healing, connection and peace that comes with such moments

Or did your loneliness know only screens, bombs exploded and lives lost in video games and movies?

By killing yourself at the age of 20

I am 37 now, realized there was a way out of suffering. I am not enlightened. This morning, when I heard the news, and read the words of my shocked classmates, within minutes a wave of sorrow arose, and I wept. Then I walked a bit further, into the woods skirting our monastery, winter cold of France, for their families. But I also cried for you, because it is the landscape of my mind.

I don't think you hated those children

I cried because I have failed you. I have failed to show you how to cry. I have failed to sit and listen to you without judging or reacting. Like many of my peers, with the congratulations of friends and the approbation of my elders. I was one of the many young people who left, and in leaving we left others, including you, just born, behind. In that sense I am a part of the culture that failed you. I didn't know yet what a community was, or that I was a part of one, and so desperately needed it.

I have failed to be one of the ones who could have been there to sit and listen to you. I was not there to help you to breathe and become aware of your strong emotions

But I am also certain that others in the community cared for you

In eighth grade I lived in terror of a classmate and his anger. It was the first time I knew aggression. No computer screen or television gave a way out, so he would fear and respect me. Did you dream like this too?

The way out of being a victim is not to become the destroyer. No matter how great your loneliness, like each one of us, still have the capacity to be awake, to be free, to be happy, without being the cause of anyone's sorrow. You didn't know that, or couldn't see that

With this terrible act you have let us know. Now I am listening, and you are not gone. And you may not be at peace until we can stop all our busyness, our quest for power, money or sex, our lives of fear and worry, and really listen to you, Adam, a brother

But we needed your help too, and that takes courage and humility. Because you were unable to do this, you have left a heavy legacy for generations to come. If we cannot learn how to connect with you and understand the loneliness, rage and despair you felt—which also lie deep and sometimes hidden within each one of us—not by connecting through Facebook or Twitter or email or telephone, but by really sitting with you and opening our hearts to you, your rage will manifest again in yet unforeseen forms.

Now we know you are there. You are not random, woman or child does not need to go halfway across the world to become a monk to learn how to do this. As a community we need to sit down and learn how to cherish life, not with gun-checks and security, but by being fully present for one another, by being truly there for one another. For me, this is the way to restore harmony to our communion.

I spent time at Abhayagiri, US and Thai temples/monasteries. Come friends, let us share questions, answers, and stories. AMAA",259,"For now, which has always fascinated me but I am woefully nescient in.)

I was ordained by the Venerable *Phra Maha Prasert Kavissaro* of Wat Buddhanusorn in Fremont, I then had the chance to intensively analyse sections of various Tripitaka interpretations alongside secluded meditation in the middle of the forest. My third main teacher is Ven *Ajahn Roemchai Chinwangso* of the Thai Forest Tradition under Ven *Ajahn Lee Dhammadharo* and Ven *Luang-pu Mun Bhuritatto*.

Those are my main influences and teachers

I traveled often, Chinese Mahayana, and Zen. I sought to answer my own questions about the nature of existence and human suffering, especially after experiencing my own personal crippling depression following time spent at the Concentration Camps in Europe, the Killing Fields of Cambodia, and seeing the devastation in the wake of the Christmas Tsunami.

I am happy to have borne witness to the first joint Theravadan Bhikkhuni ordination in the western hemisphere (probably the 2nd or 3rd overall in over a thousand years while the Mahayana kept the tradition strong) and weathered the political aftermath. While the main institutions of Theravadan Buddhism still struggle with equality issues

So ask away! My areas of expertise lie in: Thai Theravadan Buddhism, Thai-American Buddhism, and the International (farang) brand of Theravadan Buddhism growing around the world that is far more accessible to English-speakers/foreigners, or general questions about my experiences, monastic life, and my personal understanding of Buddhism. I make no claims to have reached any high level of practice, jhanas

My own beliefs are perhaps more secular humanist and liberal than those of my teachers. I am willing to answer almost any of your questions now and for the next week or so. Please forgive me if any of my answers are not that of proper dhamma

1357081719.0,15sk1n,10 Must Read Life Lessons from Buddha,Sterkelee,261,61,59,"*Siddhartha Gautama was a great spiritual leader from ancient India who founded Buddhism. In most Buddhist traditions, and monastic rules were recapitulated after his death and memorized by his followers.*

*Today I want to discuss some very important life lessons which I’ve derived from the teachings of Buddha.*

*     **10 Must Read Life Lessons from Buddha:**

**1. Its Okay to Start Small**

*“A jug fills drop by drop.”*

Ralph Waldo Emerson said

We all start small, you will succeed! No one succeeds over night; success belongs to those who are willing to start small and patiently work until their jug is filled.

**2. Thoughts Become Things**

*“All that we are is the result of what we have thought. If a man speaks or acts with an evil thought, like a shadow that never leaves him.”*

Buddha said

In order to live rightly

Your thinking determines your actions; your actions determine your outcome. Right thinking will grant you everything you desire; wrong thinking is a vice that will eventually destroy you.

If you change your thinking you will change your life. Buddha said

**3. Forgive**

*“Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one who gets burned.”*

When you release those who you are holding captive in the prison of un-forgiveness, learn to forgive quickly.

**4. It’s Your Actions That Count**

*“However many holy words you read

They say “Talk is cheap

Greatness is for everyone, but he doesn’t throw it into their nest.” To be great you must act great. Buddha said, “I do not believe in a fate that falls on men however they act; but I do believe in a fate that falls on them unless they act.”

**5. Seek to Understand**

*“In a controversy the instant we feel anger we have already ceased striving for the truth

Stephen Covey said, very difficult to do; you must labor to understand the “other” person’s perspective. When you feel anger rising, let it cease. Listen to others, understand their perspective, and you will have more peace. Be more concerned with being happy, than being right.

**6. Conquer Yourself**

*“It is better to conquer yourself than to win a thousand battles. Then the victory is yours. It cannot be taken from you

He who can conquer himself is greater than the mighty. To conquer yourself you must conquer your mind. You must control your thinking. Your thoughts cannot be tossed to and fro like the waves of the sea. You may be thinking, it comes.” To that I say, you may not be able to stop a bird from flying over your head, but you can certainly stop him from building a nest in your hair. Dismiss thoughts that are contrary to the life you desire to live. Buddha said, “It is a man’s own mind, not his enemy or foe that lures him to evil ways.”

**7. Live in Peace**

*“Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without.”*

Don’t look without for something that can only be found within. Many times we may look without only to distract ourselves from the reality we know is true. That reality is that peace can only be found within. Peace is not a new job, and that new perspective begins with you.

**8. Be Thankful**

*“Let us rise up and be thankful, and if we didn’t learn a little, at least we didn’t get sick, and if we got sick, at least we didn’t die; so, let us all be thankful.”*

There’s always something to be thankful for. Don’t be so pessimistic that for a moment, recognize it, and give thanks. A grateful heart will make you great!

**9. Be True to What You Know**

*“The only real failure in life is not to be true to the best one knows.”*

We know a lot, but ponder on thoughts that are conducive to what you desire to become until you have a burning desire to manifest it.

**10. Travel Well**

*“It is better to travel well than to arrive.”*

Life is about the journey! I’m not trying to arrive, and satisfied where I am today. I may experience nicer places, and finer wines, but I am traveling well. Don’t put off your happiness into some nebulous time in the future based on some goal that you think will bring you happiness. Travel well today, enjoy the journey.

“So whatever you wish that others would do to you

Then,"". I proceeded by showing her my Thai Buddhism locket from my dad telling her the locket is not meant for the future but as a charm to keep me safe in the present.

Since I have been here, this text is a fake Buddha quote or some other pithy witticism that is also often inaccurate.

 I have personally never liked these posts, lately there has been some grumbling about them. In fairness, there may have always been, and I am just paying attention more now that I am a moderator.

On the other hand

So, or if most people would like to see these types of posts banned?

I may have to work late tonight


*Edit:* 
I have had a break from work

I am strongly favoring an outright ban for several reasons.

First, these posts are already annoying at best. We don't have to wait until we have explored the entire warren to do something.

Second

Third, but I know that I don't read the comments in many subs that I browse. 

The reason I favor an outright ban is because I don't have the time to research these quotes and I doubt other moderators do.

Finally, this sub will be filled with bubblegum content.

To be completely blunt, at all. I think it's in fact **the exact opposite of what the Buddha taught.** We purposelessly wander in samsara in birth-and-death **precisely** because we are always ""in the present moment"", attached to whatever the present experience seems to show, and fail to see the **big picture**. But the big picture that the Buddha wants us to see is exactly what the New Age ideology demands us to ditch (thinking about the big picture / future rebirth(s) / Nirvana is shunned as ""not being in the present moment"" or ""desiring enlightenment"" - as if it was bad! As if the Buddha didn't have a super-strong, stubborn desire for enlightenment that made him abandon the ""present moment"" of ""enjoying"" his time with his wife - *most future/goal-oriented guy ever*, far from the Big Lebowski, the Buddha was certainly *not* a ""chill dude"": look what he sacrificed! look how hard he practised! the discipline, victory over life and death""! - I paraphrase. Let's not fool ourselves here about who He was.)

All this was perfectly exemplified when someone posted a ""quote"" of Lord Buddha saying: ""Abandon past

The **real** quote says **exactly the opposite**: let go of the past, at least to me.

 Perhaps the first step would be to humble ourselves profoundly, and read the texts. The Zen guys love to say how their teaching is ""outside of scriptures"", but Bodhidharma handed the *Lankavatara Sutra* to Hui-ke, and Hui-Neng got enlightened hearing the *Diamond Sutra*. If you read the main text of Zen, the Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch of Zen, he says *studying the Diamond Sutra* is the main practice of Zen. ""Sit down and shut up!"" the ideology of Brad Warner the popularizer of Soto Zen, is just a very specific development of Buddhism (Japanese Soto Zen), the biggest fat-ass text you'll ever hold in your hands. Zen

We can make ""our own Buddha"" (just like how some modern-day Christians make their own ""personal Jesus""), except to feed our narcissism? Will that end suffering, if our narcissism is one of the reasons we suffer in the first place?

If there were no taints, there'd be no duality, there'd be no good and bad, no sense or nonsense, no real and unreal, no will nor no-will.

But how could everything become something that it's not? It can't, because it contains both parts of it, and thus by containing both parts, it can create and uncreate.

Why is it illusory? Because everything will never stop being everything.

Can a drop of water in the ocean say ""I'm more water than all the other drops""? It can't. If a drop of water wanted to dry another drop of water, there's no real destruction, nor a real individual.

We are like drops of water in the sea. But that division is not the ultimate nature of reality, and we should consider it as real; not being foolish and disregarding things.

Taints give rise to our personality

But if a drop ceased it's illusory boundaries with the rest of the water

I've become so apathetic to things. I no longer have any opinions on anything subjective, my friend will say ""Wow. Is she aware of how idiotic she looks?"" and I won't reply. Because my reply is always the same. ""Perhaps she's just having a really bad day.""

When written, and integrating parts into my life. I feel like existence is so clear to me. I used to get existential depression often, however I haven't had it since I've been studying Buddhism.

Although I feel like I've become a more understanding person, but another one I guess would be if, while gaming, my girlfriend accidentally kills me (and it was the only life I had remaining). She says ""Sorry sorry sorry"" and I just say ""No problem. It's okay! It was an accident.""

I was raised Christian my whole life and accepted Christianity with little question. This past winter break I have been looking into other religious and Buddhism stood out to me. I realized that I could no longer accept Christianity as the truth and started my own spiritual journey.

Fast forward to yesterday. I am in Home Depot getting a light for my Lava Lamp and I see this Monk checking out. I wait until he is outside and introduce myself. I tell him my story and that I am still new to the life of the Buddhist. He tells me that he owns a Monastery near by (There is actually 2) and that we would teach me the art of Meditation as well as educate me in the way of the Buddha. He gave me the number to the place and invited me to their meetings. 

I am so thankful for a teacher like him and I am looking forward to what he has to teach me. I am excited to start learning from him and developing my inner Buddha through education and meditation. 

TL;DR: Just accepted the Buddhist lifestyle

Question: They meet every other Sunday at the Monastery at 6pm. Is this a usual meeting time for Buddhists?

1310805859.0,ir691,A FAQ for people new to Buddhism,,156,29,87,"Hello, I promise I'll make it worth it for new and old buddhists.

The reason why I'm telling you who I am is not in hope this grants me any authority on the subject

---

This subreddit is growing constantly and I'm very happy to see this. This means many people got to hear about Buddhism, so I'm hoping it will do the same to your life, no matter how small the improvement is.

Here are some FAQ that I hope can save you some time and keep you from some misdirections/misconceptions

---

**What is Buddhism and who can call himself a buddhist?**

Buddhism is following the buddha's teachings, an agnostic, a christian, a mormon or any religion and also be buddhist. You don't need to worship anyone.

**Why are there monks?**

Monks are disciples who vowed to follow Buddha's teachings. The difference to any other person (per se) is the vows that they take

**Do I need to/Should I aim to become a monk if I practice Buddhism?**

No. You can practice without this aim. Choosing to become a monk is like buying your house, because you know exactly what you are buying and because you know you can live happily there. Don't do it if you ""have heard"" that it's ""the right thing"" or if you think it's the only way to archive peace, or any other unrealistic view.

**What is meditation and what can I do with it?**

Meditation is focusing the mind in a chosen task. For example, you can focus your mind in anything you chose, as long as you always focus your mind. Meditation is work. In a broader Buddhist context (or in different Buddhist practices), this could be any kind of spiritual cultivation (*bhavana*).


**How many kinds of meditations there are?**

There are literary thousands of kinds of meditations with all short of aims of which here in west we only get to know a very small bunch. Most of them are taught in Asia by people who spend all their life studying meditation very seriously


**What is samsara?**

Samsara is an Indian term that can be described as ""suffering"". Suffering in this context doesn't exactly translate to pain, unpleasant or neutral sensation. In a strict sense, samsara is the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth.

**Do I have to become vegetarian to be a Buddhist?**

No. Only if you want to


**What is enlightenment?**

Enlightenment is a process in which a practitioner gains consciousness

**What's Dharma?**

Dharma is the things the way they are. To understand Dharma is to have a flawless understanding of the true nature of things. It's a tough topic

**What are attachments and what's ""getting rid of attachments""?**

Attachments is a term that describes something that troubles us because we are holding on to it and we aren't willing to let go. It's an unconscious act.

Contrary to what many people think, not wanting, not crying, etc.). What ""not having attachments"" means is that even tho you might want something, you won't allow it (what you want) to cloud your mind and/or prevent you from doing the right thing (your duties, your obligations, your responsibilities).

To get rid of an attachment you must first become aware of it


**What is Karma?**

Karma is a term used to describe a synergy or negative synergy that our acts create and how it relates with other's synergy or negative synergy. **Karma is not a form of ""an eye for an eye"", some others decrease them, some other cause interference or nullification (of positive or negative acts), and everyone interacts with other people's waves in different ways.  Some waves are big, some waves are small. This can also be a tough topic, don't worry if you don't get it.


**What is a ""buddha"" and what is ""the Buddha"" and what's the difference?**

A ""buddha"" is a term to describe any person who reaches enlightenment. ""The Buddha"" refers to Siddhartha Gautama, because he practices the Buddha's teachings, even tho he doesn't know or doesn't recognize them as the Buddha's teachings. This is, for example, like we don't needing someone to explain us what speaking is for us to begin speaking.

**Do Buddhist worship Buddha?**
No. A Buddha is not a god. A Buddha and the Buddha are teachers who we offer our respect and memory

In many traditions, they place a buddha's image, which also helps them to remind the Buddha's teachings.


**What is a ""koan""?**

A koan is a term used to describe a puzzle a teacher gives to a buddhism student in order for him to introspect and meditate until he has acquired an specific understanding. This teaching is the key to make the koan understandable.


**What am I supposed to do in Buddhism?**

In buddhism you are invited to think, to enjoy life, to be happy, to respect others, to listen, **to ask**, to care, to have confidence, to construct, to welcome not change

**What am I not supposed to do in Buddhism?**

You are not invited to: harm others, over think things, ""complicate your existence"" or others', take things too seriously -including yourself-, to censure, to have fear of doing what you think it's right even tho it contradicts what I or someone told you, or even the Buddha.

**Some things to remember**

- Buddhism is about being happy and **being true to yourself**. If you are suffering

- Being true to yourself doesn't mean making excuses to not do or change things.

- Always feel free to ask.

- Don't worry too much if you don't get something.

- If you get stuck

- Don't mind too much what others tell you; no more than your own opinion. Just always fundament your own opinion

- Like in any other thing

- If you get to understand something don't be preachy. It's not in Buddha's teachings.

- It's ok and normal to feel sad, angry, irritated, excited, etc. Just as long as it doesn't distract you from being conscious and you don't dwell on it.

1304846082.0,h6lio,I'm a Shaolin monk's disciple AMA,,148,23,224,"Hello reddit
I'm a Shaolin's warrior monk disciple, which most are not clearly answered. **I would like to help with any question you have regarding Buddhism or meditation, its' history or interpretations of various concepts or stories.**

We practice Chan (zen) Buddhism, but rather that it takes a shift in one's understanding which, specially at it's earliest levels, can not be conveyed by words. It's like trying to show a blue flower to someone with red colored eye glasses... Until he reaches them and takes them off, he will see the blue flower as black.

I will set some subjects

-----

- Anyway first off, no concept it's there magically or arbitrarily.

- Second

- Third, but it most surely won't prepare you to swim in the sea. Also there are many fake teachers or teachers who have not the truthful knowledge, thus their knowledge will only span more confusion.

- Fourth

- Fifth, without work a meditation is just relaxation, thus, it won't bring enlightenment.

- Sixth, you are in for one of a lot of hard work, both mental AND physical.

- Seventh, and those are meant to be said to specific persons, with specific problems and at specific times.

- Eighth, if you don't fully understand it, than to practice it within confusion. Riding a car might get you faster to where you want to go, but if you don't know how to drive it, it might even get you injured or others.

- Ninth, we give them for granted, and then later we wonder why we don't understand the world. The further you go in Chan, the more you amaze of how simple the world is, and how complicated we make it for ourselves and others.

- Tenth, it is that it must be based on mindful work. The meditative postures and breathing and focus of the mind will relax the body and mind, but this is just the start, and to give you an honest comparison, it's like giving 1 step in a marathon. As a master once said ""One must correct the body, then correct the breathing. After this, one can begin to correct the mind""

- Eleventh, but's accompanied with knowledge and a new perception. This might not sound mystical like most texts and quotes you will find, but it's not less truthful.

- Twelfth, the one who must solve them is you. And it doesn't matter who your teacher is, you have to be there to face your life alone. You can solve your problems with Chan, or without it. Chan is just another road to the same goal we all have: happiness.

------

Anyway I think I set many good subjects here, Shaolin, or any other thing. I would rather not go much into details about my background since i don't think it maters, because no matter who my shifu is, it won't make my words more or less truthful. Thus, they must be truthful to you, or else you won't agree with them.  Also I don't want you guys to think I'm doing this for promotion, we can talk about it.

Our reality perception is bent and uncalibrated. Some times we diminish value to things that have more value (being centred, wellbeing, focus, concentration), and we overpower things that have no value (worries, anxieties, distractions

Stress, smaller more or less important that it is.

We must know that the fact that we feel something doesn't meant it actually is that. That we think something doesn't mean it actually is that. That we think we don't know something doesn't meant we actually don't know it. That we don't see something doesn't mean we aren't seeing it.

We have to be aware that what we *think* or seems it is sometimes it isn't. And sometimes it is. So we must calibrate our discernment throughout observation.

Sometimes the answer is as simple as: Why I can't have an answer to this? Because the question is wrongly formulated.

Why can't I understand this? Because it's incongruent

We have to be aware that in the exam of meditation

We have to remember that there are layers and there's not only consciousness-reality interacting. But that reality is: Consciousness &gt; mental formations &gt; Perception &gt; Sensation &gt; Form &gt; Consciousness again

So summing it up, and are anxious about is unrealistic. Like when we thought there's a monster under our bed. Then we realised we had actually never seen one in our life, just thought we had.

Losing someone, incarceration, torture, etc. Aren't that bad. I have endured days without eating, and very hard pains myself both emotionally and physically (and those who don't think so, I'd invite you to go train with a Shaolin monk :P ).

The only way something is bad is if we suffer from it

If you make a little rewind of your memory, in fact, most of the times you didn't even care or noticed about it.

Remember when you were a kid and you got hurt and your parents got sickly worried but you didn't even noticed. Remember when you squished a bug and didn't care. Remember when a member of the family died which you didn't actually knew and you were puzzled as to why everyone else was so sad. All those things, you didn't felt it as bad.

This doesn't mean we should be careless and heartless, happenings and actions are not inherently related to suffering! Nor anything else.

You can pretty much do anything in life without suffering if you are genuinely good in the heart or genuinely want to be good in the heart.

I think our teachers, that being, they don't mix well. They are an obstruction like any other.

If I am wrong about this, I would appreciate more information, be it from a valid source, not an anecdotal story. 

It seems odd that people who do indulge come here looking for some spiritual ""meaning"" to the feeling of being high. There isn't one. It is an illusion, upvoting the drug questions about how Dharma can help them detach from the poison of addiction is one thing. To justify it's basis or simply be overly nice about it waters down the truth of the matter: The precepts are pretty clear, the teachings are not very obstructed in this message.

a week or so ago there was a post about Shaolin monks in which I replied. Some people asked me to do an AMA

A bit about my background: I've been practicing gong fu for 5 years now, sanda, chi gong, taolu and some traditional weapons like sword, spear and staff. My longest still meditation has been for about an hour and a half. I've also practiced some dream meditations and stayed fully consciously thru the process of dreaming. I've also spent some days in the mountains near my city with my master doing chán practices.

A bit about my life: I live in México with my master, I eat meat, I go out with friends and drink when invited to and I smoke from time to time. I don't do illegal drugs tho, nor think about doing it. I haven't taken any vows regarding any of the previously mentioned things and I center my practice in learning from every experience. When I quit doing something is because I fully understood why I was doing it and what attracted me about it; in this way I learn about my attachments and I become freer from them.

A bit about my lineage: I'm 34th generation in Shaolin, a bikshu (or Bhikkhu) monk.

I had already done one AMA and I think this is a good opportunity for me and some of you who remember the previous one to see what has changed and what has stayed the same.

I hope you can learn from this as much as I will do and feel free to ask me about any subject. If I had anything to say about buddhism is that buddhism is as open and broad as life itself and there's nothing about our own lives we should feel attached to

1351146770.0,121yja,My Encounter with an Enlightened Monk,,128,29,29,"I recently visited a Buddhist center in my area to attend the typical service.  I ended up with a very unique surprise.  I'm running late trying to hurry as fast as possible so I can make the beginning of the ceremony. I haphazardly enter into the primary room where our session is about to begin.

The typical crowd was there:  That one old person who snores during Vipassana, the joyous monks, and overly-spiritual post menopausal lady were all present.  However, there was someone different.  An additional orange robe was chilling out in the corner.  Who was this elder monk?  Why did he give me a weird vibe?

The traditional service began as usual.  I thought nothing much of this foreign character; I barely even had a view of him from my vantage point.  As the session continued

Towards the end of our whole session

He was an overwhelmingly plain character.  All of the resident monks and any skilled practitioner could have answered questions better than him.  His Dharma talk was extremely simple.  Nothing about him was special except for one thing that was very subtle.

His mental state was *astounding.*  The untrained might think he was just a goofy

I tried to listen to his Dharma talk.  I really did.  His answers weren't articulated very well due to language barriers and the poor questioners seemed confused at his answers.  They must have thought he was a mediocre monk.  If I was new I probably would have too.  I stopped paying attention to all the words he said and watched his body language, I don't know of any other comparisons to give.  If a person could love life as he did, for just a moment, they would be ready to die.  

The service ended.  People were getting up and clearing out.  It was at this moment I realized I could meet him.  Now was my chance!  Then I realized, when you looked closer at a very subtle level, his level of mental ecstasy and spiritual wholeness were simply magical.

The Dharma he found wasn't through words and the Dharma I witnessed wasn't through them either.  He wasn't trying to be present.  He wasn't acting or pretending to be holier than thou.  He was just in his natural state. I thanked him for visiting my center and smiled.  That was all.  No question I would have asked would have done an ounce of justice.  Nothing else was needed.  There was nothing else to say. I just went on doing my thing and he did too.

Then a large number of monks went to the Blessed One and, sat to one side. As they were sitting there, they informed him: ""Lord, there is a certain monk by the name of Elder who lives alone and extols the virtues of living alone.""

Then the Blessed One told a certain monk, call the monk named Elder, saying, 'The Teacher calls you, my friend.'""

""As you say, having gone to Ven. Elder, on arrival he said, ""The Teacher calls you, my friend.""

""As you say, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, the Blessed One said to him, ""Is it true, Elder

""Yes

""But how do you live alone and extol the virtues of living alone?""

""Lord, alone I sit withdrawn [in meditation], alone I do walking meditation. That is how I live alone and extol the virtues of living alone.""

At times it seems there is not even enough time to breathe mindfully.,TamSanh,110,15,9,"This is not a personal problem only; this is a problem of the whole civilization. That is why we have to practice not only as individuals;we have to practice as a society. We have to make a revolution in the way we organize our society and our daily life
 
Meanwhile, breathe out, and enjoy arriving in the present moment. There are many things like that we can do. Years ago I was in Montreal on the way to a retreat, and I noticed that the license plates said Je me souviens-""I remember."" I did not know what they wanted to remember, but to me it means that I remember to breathe and to smile (laughter). So I told a friend who was driving the car that I had a gift for the sangha in Montreal: every time you see Je me souviens, you remember to breathe and smile and go back to the present moment. Many of our friends in the Montreal sangha have been practicing that for more than ten years.
 
I think we can enjoy the red light; we can also enjoy the stop sign. Every time we see it we profit: instead of being angry at the red light, breathing out, smiling.That helps a lot. And when you hear the telephone ringing you can consider it to be the sound of the mindfulness bell. You practice telephone meditation. Every time you hear the telephone ringing you stay exactly where you are (laughter). You breathe in and breathe out and enjoy your breathing. Listen, listen-this wonderful sound brings you back to your true home. Then when you hear the second ring you stand up and you go to the telephone with dignity (laughter). That means in the style of walking meditation (laughter). You know that you can afford to do that, because if the other person has something really important to tell you, she will not hang up before the third ring. That is what we call telephone meditation. We use the sound as the bell of mindfulness.
 
And waiting at the bus stop you might like to try mindful breathing, why don't you use walking meditation, because that improves the quality of our life. That brings more peace and serenity, and the quality of the work we do will be improved just by that kind of practice. So it is possible to integrate the practice into our daily life. We just need a little bit of creative imagination to do so.",,False,self,False,t3_y78bu

It was on an air force base and the pay was excellent.  However being there for 6 years I trained a lot of people since I was, it was just me reading what my boss left for me to do on a list.

This caused a lot of strain with my coworkers.

I left for about 10 months to go work in a call center for DirecTV.  In that time I found out that I enjoyed helping people more than I had cared to obeying the rules set before me.  When I left DTV for personal reasons, I had to power through despite the fact that a sexual harassment blemish on my record at 19 would ruin my life.

One day during the 2011 November holiday prep, and the hygiene bundle packages of AXE.  This year like all the rest we had box sets of perfume and cologne from Tim McGraw, Beyonce, and Halle Berry, I think even Tony Stewart through his name in the ring there.  They had bars of soap, face wash, and a small bottle of cologne all for a great bargain.  My friend and I silently joked about Tim McGraw and Halle Berry's perfume when a few weeks it happened.

I was restocking some of the shelves and making room on our holiday aisle when a woman came up to Halle Berry's perfume.  She picked it up, and put it in her cart; very typical process.  But I stopped for a second and looked at that.  The genius of it all.  I was so awestruck by it.  It finally occurred to me that someone, somewhere is going to get that perfume, maybe a little girl, and she is going to be **ecstatic** to get it.  It didnt have to be a 200 dollar cologne, it didnt have to be anything more, but shes going to get that perfume

I went and sat down in the office and thought about it.  I thought about all the dumb jokes I made about those colognes and people buying those things for their kids and themselves and I felt terrible.  Those cheap eyeliners and mascaras at the grocery store,,False,self,t5_2qhnf,False,,True

I've grown from my training, I find it hard to fight all the anger and negative emotions within the army, and I can honestly say that it poisons me. 
I am compassionate

I have very strong mixed feelings about the whole ordeal. I am asking for a new outlook, and I want to help others. And although the army helped me grow, I find it is slowly poisoning me. I am a hundred percent sure that I can turn this suffering into something positive, healthy that could help me grow. But I am having a lot of trouble now.

Here are a few books written by Buddhists, or other people wanting to package what they are selling in the label 'Buddhism'. Here I have picked a few books that are written by reliable and well known Buddhist teachers. These books are light, readable, and convey the teachings of a tradition in a very open way. Let's call this category, ""preaching and teaching"":

Another way to approach Buddhism is to read canonical texts. These texts should be read with an open and patient mind. Reading scripture is different than reading history or literature

The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha: A Translation of the

The Sutra of Queen Srimala of the Lion's Roar and the Vimalakirti Sutra (Bdk English Tripitaka Translation Series)


And finally, here are a few more advanced academic works in Buddhist Studies. These books cover up-to-date information on various topics including: the history of the academic study of Buddhism, Buddhism in the West, the rise of the Mahayana, Indian Buddhism, and Chan/Son/Zen Buddhism. Here I have included works that will assist you in deepening your knowledge of Buddhist history (more will be added later):

1335538600.0,svcga,The Dalai Lama on emptiness,rvweber,106,20,60,"There are always a lot of questions on emptiness

One of the most important philosophical insights in Buddhism comes from what is known as the theory of emptiness. At its heart is the deep recognition that there is a fundamental disparity between the way we perceive the world

In our day-to-day experience, discrete and enduring reality. For instance, if we examine our own conception of selfhood, we will find that we tend to believe in the presence of an essential core to our being, which characterises our individuality and identity as a discrete ego, independent of the physical and mental elements that constitute our existence.

The philosophy of emptiness reveals that this is not only a fundamental error but also the basis for attachment, independent existence is simply untenable. All things and events, whether ‘material’, mental or even abstract concepts like time, are devoid of objective, independent existence.

To intrinsically possess such independent existence would imply that all things and events are somehow complete unto themselves and are therefore entirely self-contained. This would mean that nothing has the capacity to interact with or exert influence on any other phenomena. But we know that there is cause and effect – turn a key in a car, inherently existing things, these events could never occur!

So effectively, everything is argued as merely being composed of dependently related events; of continuously interacting phenomena with no fixed, immutable essence, which are themselves in dynamic and constantly changing relations. Thus, things and events are 'empty' in that they can never possess any immutable essence, intrinsic reality or absolute ‘being’ that affords independence.",,self,,

1359446824.0,17hj97,Nothing in the world makes me happy,pinchitony,102,19,107,"And I'll tell you why reddit.

I'll lend you a secret. It's the secret of ultimate happiness.

My ultimate secret for happiness is this: *Nothing in the world makes me happy.*

That's right, not relationships, not entertainment, not playing, not action, not inaction, not sex, not health, not myself, not my expectations

You know why? Because my happiness doesn't depend on any of those things! My happiness can't be traced to any particular thing in the world because I know that the moment I put my happiness on anything in this world that moment my happiness can be shattered.

When I put my happiness in my health, when that person doesn't do what I want or is ill or dies, I feel bad. When I put my happiness in love, when I don't feel loved I feel bad, and so on!

So I don't place my happiness on anything! And that makes me very happy with everything and lets me really enjoy things!

Isn't it funny how that works?

Is that simple. And there's no better person in the world that someone who is truthfully happy, or take from anyone and make anyone unhappy, because you don't need anything. Only when a heart lacks or needs something from this world can make evil deeds, because delusion and ignorance is the root of all evils!

So I hope you realise that nothing in this world makes you happy :)

If you can learn and handle the meaning of this

Take care.",self,t5_2qhnf,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/17hj97/nothing_in_the_world_makes_me_happy/

By the time I was 13 or 14 I was unhappy all the time.  Happiness had seemed to have disappeared.  My depression worsened even more at the age of 16.  My mother had me start seeing a psychologist.  He diagnosed me with the disorder known as Anhedondia [characterized by the inability to experience joy from normal activities though to be from dopamine and other chemicals not being released in the brain].  I slowly improved a little bit and left my psychologist.  In my late 16th year I discovered Buddhism and began to study its ideas and teachings.  This summer, but it was still very empty.  Yesterday night
Moments after this sorrow had appeared I had a realization.  I had said to myself that “I” was suffering again.  There was an ""I"" that had been said!  I remembered that my emotions did not define who I am and sough to be free from them.  So I began to sit in meditation with the intention of separating the ego and emotions from myself that had been tormenting me for years.   My mind felt very clear and when I was sitting time seemed to have stopped.  It felt like I was watching my thoughts from the outside in.  Letting them go.  Suddenly, but I really wanted to tell all of you.  Many someday I’ll understand it.  Buddhism, this online Sangha,  and many other speakers and thinkers have helped me along my journey.

ORIGINAL POST:
------------
I've practiced meditation daily for 45 years -- 1 1/2 to 3 hrs a day actually 'missing' maybe 10 days. Began as a very yogically based practice, which I maintain to this day. I've probably visited this board only 5 or 6 times since noticing it a year(?) or so ago. There are things that a simple, daily, disciplined practice make clear over time that, ideally, working closely with a conscientious teacher would clear up immediately. I'm not a scholar, and make no claims to anything other than a prolonged and somewhat disciplined approach to practice, with anyone
Again, and was really raised up in the tradition of practice to 'work hard and shut up' about it. I.e., it's not something that I normally broadcast.
Anyway .. I just did some answering of questions on another sub/r about working with Bruce Lee several years ago and it occurred to me after that what working with him really led me to was not furthering in martial arts but, thought I'd ask if this sounded like anything that might be of value to anyone here. I wouldn't see it as ""me telling you what's up"" .. but I thought it could be done as a little sort of round table discussion sort of thing, though it would be based in my background I guess. I'll check back .. if it looks like it might, then I'll set a time or something. If not .. thanks for your consideration of it.

**Edit** - This little outing has really driven home to me the difficulty of beginning practice -- it had been so long for me .. so long ago since I wrestled with those issues .. that I had grown anesthetized to them.  In a few hours I will write a direct response to questions from here

**Edit-2** So I just added a long piece down the page a ways .. with ""PRACTICE .. PRACTICE .. PRACTICE .. "" along the top and then another as a conclusion to it

I don't really have any friends right now. That is, but I don't do anything outside of work with other humans. I feel distant and separated from everyone.

Which is strange, etc. So how can I feel separated? Yet I do, because the brain of any social animal compels them to seek contact with others. So that's an inescapable skandha, right, so I just need to make sure I'm not attached to it?

Then there's that quote everyone loves to toss around, how are you exercising compassion?

I tried going to the Buddhist temple for a while to find some sort of community or belonging in a social sense. I feel stupid for it, the temple didn't bring me anything, as dukkha inhabits all things. Not sure what I expected.

What do I think will change if I have friends or if I talk to people? Possibly being a hermit is a good thing.

But there's something else that gives rise to a thought that violently rejects that notion. No, I must know people, but how?

1362666638.0,19uge3,The refuge of no refuge,SergioDuBois,87,8,5,"""The first, Sangha; in Tibetan

**Sang-gyé** (""buddha"") means complete, darker place: I go home, I go to bed, I close the door and I go to sleep; and I lock it all out. This is not what is meant by refuge in Buddhism. Buddhism is always *the refuge of no-refuge*. Sang-gyé, complete open wakefulness, is different from this idea. It is *complete*. Refuge is not complete because it is refuge from something. This is the refuge of no-refuge; it is complete. It is open – it is not closed. And it is wakeful – it is not hiding in some way. Sang-gyé kyab-su ché: *I establish confidence in the actuality of complete, open wakefulness*. I usually translate refuge in this way – refuge is the establishment of confidence in the actuality of something. Buddha here is not the founder of the religion, what we can realise ourselves to be – this complete

Then there is **chö**, as it ought to be – *as-it-is*. This is also the refuge of no-refuge; because I cannot say I do not like how it is and I want my money back. This is not a philosophy; this is not something created by anybody, even though people have written about it. No one who ever writes about it owns it; apart from owning it in their being. Dharma—as-it-is— we can discover how it is. This is why Shakyamuni Buddha said: You must not accept my words simply because I am saying them. You have to check these words out; you have to test them. The analogy was to test them like the goldsmith tests gold – by rubbing and burnishing and doing all the tests you can to prove that this is what it is. One has to prove it within one’s own *experience*. That is what is meant by chö. Chö is *not* something to be believed; chö is something to be *discovered*. Here one has to have the courage and openness to accept that what one discovers one might not like. I might not be comfortable with the reality I find in this; it might threaten me in some way. But somehow I am not going to retreat from that and create a cosier version of reality that makes me comfortable. Chö is having one’s nose pressed hard up against the reality of what is there. 

Then there is **gen-dün**, gossiping individuals, then certainly there is no refuge there. Maybe in the West we have the best possible kind of sangha already; I do not know. I have often had sad perspectives on how Buddhists are with each other in the West. There seems to be a high level of neurosis in which people seem to be there for many different reasons; and often it does not seem to be about becoming more open as an individual. It seems to be about joining a club, being part of something where there is an in-group and an out-group where people are excluded and there are people to talk about. Obviously no refuge is offered there; it is really the refuge of no-refuge if it is like this. What is meant here is that sangha are people who are *changing*. These are people who are *practising*; therefore, they are empty people. Usually the definition of a friend is he or she who backs me up in my neurosis: I tell you about the person I have some problem with, and we both sit down and say: ‘Yes – asshole!’ This is how friends usually operate; but this is not necessarily how sangha operates. Sangha are people who are changing; their neuroses should not have such a tight bind on them as they used to have. If we live in a world where we meet sangha members, and one finds that: ‘Hmmm,’ that is threatening. I think that sangha members feel that they have to give each other gratuitous spiritual advice. This is not what is meant by sangha, but then – there are other things too.’ It is not that one has to be puritanical about that, but not really shoring it up and fuelling it. When we are with people like this

*This is important.* This is the functioning of compassion. When one can see someone being really irritated and angry with someone else, I can see why you’re irritated.’ You have to resonate a little bit; otherwise you are cut off from this person. You cannot say: ‘I don’t have such feelings.’ All you can say is: ‘Yes, I have them; but I try not to take them too seriously, because that’s not going to help in the end.’ This is refuge of no-refuge, because there is no refuge for our neurosis here. This is what is called the outer refuge.""

Vegetarianism is something I've been thinking about recently. I'm currently not a vegetarian

However

Last night I brought this up in our discussion, the Buddha told them not to turn down meat if that was what was being served in that household, because that would require them to go out of their way to provide something above and beyond what they had already prepared (and also potentially offends someone who is being gracious). It’s the “beggers can’t be choosers” paradigm. Vegetarianism, in that sense, is somewhat of a double edge sword. While it takes the animals lives who are living beings, it also negatively impacts those who are kind enough to prepare us food. The magnitude of the respective harm is certainly something to consider, but we all know the Buddha’s stance on the middle way. 

Things have changed today. We no longer have family farmers who are raising their animals in open pastures who have a relatively good life before their lives are taken. And the farmers or butchers who needed to take the lives of the animals likely did not have had to do that in a mass production setting

As a result of all this thinking, because I don’t want to concern the people who may be serving food (I’m thinking of when my dad finds his grill this spring) to find something else for me to eat. I will eat it and feel thankful for the animal whose life was taken to sustain mine. But when the choice is mine, I will try to stick to not eating meat. 

How do you think the Buddha would act in today's food environment?

Buddhist Friend: It implies that the world needs saving, like it sucks, ""I need to fix it, I need to save it, it's broken"". It's just introducing negative ideas into the world, where you could instead stay completely positive and say, ""The world is beautiful, ""Be the change you wish to see in the world."" That's first talking about what's going on in your own head. Like you can't fix the external until you work on the internal. It's all a reflection in that way.

Me: I would like to question something. To all the starving children in Africa

For the past week, and re-reading Mindfulness in Plain English. 

The result?

A small
 
I'm posting this for myself (helps to write these types of things out) and for any others who could find it beneficial. Many of these ideas have been presented in other works of literature - the content is not exactly new but the presentation (at least in my opinion) is more suitable for a beginner such as myself.

Anyways

Thoughts, opinions... are usually not positive. More often than not, these mental proliferations cause stress and problems in one’s life.

Ex:
'I'm not good-looking enough.'

'Why does that dog never shut-up?'

'Gonna be late to work

‘What the hell am I doing with my life?’

All this internal commentary inspires some very unwholesome states of mind: greed, lust, and sloth.

Worse, trapping the mind in an endless cycle of ruminations.  

Ironically, past events are misremembered.

There’s a reason that judges don’t blindly trust eyewitness accounts of crimes: the human mind is extraordinarily fallible

All of the mental clutter in your mind serves only to create a barrier between you and reality. It

This “sensory cotton” is what fuels the suffering caused by craving. 

The thoughts inside our minds sell us on the notion that happiness can be found outside of ourselves. What is the result of this fallacy? Quoting again from Mindfulness in Plain English: “We get stuck in the 'If only' syndrome. If only I had more money, if only I had a color TV, Jacuzzi, and curly hair, and on and on forever”

That if only reality were to change to fit our expectations

So we grasp the fire and scream, more. It is never enough. We stick needles into our arms, stuff cake down our throats, watch the orgy of sex and violence on the television... but the hole within ourselves is not filled. The tension is not gone. Happiness has not been achieved. The struggle against reality remains.
 
Is there a solution? Is there a way out of this trap? 

In a word

Breath by breath

Buddhism is quite easy: If you think too much, do what you feel is right. If you don't know what to feel, think what's best. If something is tough, do it until it's easy. If something is too easy, improve it until it's tough. Never keep things to yourself, get them out somehow. Never ignore your problems, face them. Never ignore your anger, sadness

Don't let anyone tell you who you are and what you can do. That's only up to you. And treat others like your family

But I surely would like to invite you to read this small guide so that you can understand a bit of why it's done, after that decide if it's your thing or not.

This post is mainly concerned with the practice as it is (as if you were already a buddhist who took refuge under the three jewels and practicing or had practice with a monk), but I surely will on another post. So please be patient and don't disregard this practice until you have gotten more information about it.

This post is for those who are already following a buddhist tradition yet lack knowledge of how to setup a proper altar.

**Foreword**

An altar above all is a practice of love, care and of a deep connection with everything that isn't you (the world, the teachers, the teachings). It'll help you grow immensely in your practice and in no way it will harm it or stop it or will make you superstitious or dumb or blind or anything... That unless you are doing something wrong, but the altar is not to blame for that.

An altar is not about getting something but about giving and learning from that. If we want to ask something from the altar we will learn that we must first give

**What is an altar**

An altar is an special place of practice. It represents the state of our practice. Whatever and however we treat our altar represents directly how we are and what we do. It's a mirror of yourself.

If we don't care much for the altar, it means we are angry at ourselves, if we generously give and sacrifice things we like to the altar, it means we are generous.

Since the altar represents our practice

From an altar, you get good. If you give nothing, you get nothing. If you give shallow things, you get shallow things. If you hide it, you be insecure, if you honour it you will be honourable, if you respect it you will be respectable. That's how it works.

**Whom will we dedicate the altar to**

An altar is dedicated to a Buddha or teacher we feel an emotional connection with. It can be dedicated to multiple buddhas

You might add other teachers that aren't strictly buddhist as Jesus

Like previously said, so don't do something you regret. Placing a person as a mockery will only harm you and your practice so just watch out for that. 

Here are some lists and images of some Buddhas: [List in wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Buddhas)

*Wrathful emanations* like Ven. Mahakala, it will very likely harm you instead of help you if you add them, so I won't be getting into that.

If you don't know which buddha to pick I suggest you one or two of these:

- [Budai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budai) if you seek joy and abundance for everyone.

- [Guanyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanyin) if you seek to be compassionate

- [Shakyamuni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha) if you seek understanding

- [Amithaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amitābha) if you seek transcendence.

- [Bodhidharma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhidharma) if you seek power

- [Medicine King](http://www.dharma-haven.org/tibetan/medicine-buddha.htm) if you seek health for you and others

- [White tara](http://www.himalayanart.org/image.cfm/51.html) if you seek your wishes and others fulfilled so we all can be happy.

- [Manjusri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manjusri) if you seek wisdom to guide your life.

- [Ksitigarbha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ksitigarbha) if you want to endure sacrifice in order to help others in seemingly unsurmountable conditions.

**What to offer to the altar**

Both physically and mentally we should offer all desirable things to the altar. What we give is what we get.

Customarily what is given is: Flowers, water, ginseng, precious metals, jewels, silk clothes, etc.

Don't give anything that you wouldn't give a buddhist monk (for example, etc.).

Play music for it (be it singing or in an audio player)

When you decorate your altar, etc.

Things that will rot are left until they rot or decay. For example a flower until it's dry

You should also give postrations and/or recite mantras to the altar.

Adding books and sutras to the altar is also nice as it's adding written mantras and any other offering we can.

**Taking care of the altar**

After it's set up

To greet the altar we must make three postrations. Here is a [video of a way](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obFdpSTsuYw)

For any interaction (be it that we add

When cleaning it, and blow three times to clean it from dust. After that the buddha might be removed and everything else.

**Practice**

An altar should be treated like if it were the teacher itself. So before we practice we should make postrations and/or give incense as possible. You will notice how your practice changes when you are conscious of the altar and the buddhas and when you are not. *It becomes healthier* because it will keep you humble and social

**About incenses**

Incenses are offered in sets of three. One for Buddha

Before lit, dharma and sangha. This is done three times. After that they can be lit and set.


**What to ask**

We should feel invited to ask for the things we want  in life to the altar since this will help us meditate upon them while asking for them to the altar and buddhas. Altho we must know the basic rule: In order to get

&gt;""Ignorant people claim that everything is mind.

&gt;They are deluded about the three types of appearance

&gt;Have many shortcomings

&gt;Meditators



The three types of appearances are:

* _percieved objects_ are the mere presence of objects to the senses (forms that appear before the eye, etc). 

* _appearances_ which are the thoughts of attachment, for instance the feeling of attachment to a pleasant object, the feeling of anger towards an unpleasant one, or the feeling of indifference towards something neutral

* _the perciever_ which is our own mind

Saying that all three of those are mind is not correct
Perceived objects are not mind

Appearances, and since all we really know are appearances, it is tempting to speculate that all is mind. In fact, the senses perceive the external objects, and relay that information to the perciever, but they do not present their information directly. We do not actually see their output, but merely the interpretation of it by our own minds. We only see the appearances. Appearances only occur in our mind, they depend on interpretation


In the Treasure of Valid Logic

&gt;Sense consciousnesses are like mutes with eyes

&gt;While thoughts are blind but talkative.

&gt;Self-awareness has all its faculties

&gt;And conveys meaning to the two.


The senses can't really say anything good or bad, and conveys that to the mind, but it does not think ""this is blue"", or ""this is pretty"". 

In contrast, bad, etc. 
There is no real connection between perceived objects and appearances. The bridge between them is self-awareness. Self awareness knows what the eye sees

Appearances are all in the mind

I've found that sloth and torpor are a major hindrance that can be fixed easily with a little effort. Many of us underestimate the importance of a full night's restful sleep

- Sleep 8 hours. There obviously can be variations in this
- Dark Therapy. The body is naturally programmed to start the sleep cycle with the onset of darkness. Stop looking at bright screens 2 hours before bed-time. If you can't do that
- Light Therapy. It's ideal to wake up to the rising sun
- Deficiencies. Most of us are deficient in Omega-3 fatty acids
- Exercise. This one is kind of obvious. If you don't exercise
- Caffeine. Cut it out. Caffeine is a stimulant that is only useful if you're already not properly rested and is almost immediately habit forming. It screws with your sleep in all sorts of ways. Keep it to a minimum
- Melatonin. This is a naturally occurring compound in the body that regulates the sleep cycle. If your sleep cycle is messed up (sleep kicks in too late)
- Meditation! 30 minutes before bed especially if you've had a very busy day will help calm your mind down and I've found it generally leads to more pleasant dreams. Thanks to cosmo_demonic.

But the fact is, I, personally, don't buy it. I respect that you may have experienced these things or things that you may have understood to be these things. But i simply cannot accept that by using ""heedless substances"" that the Buddha expressly says not to use, that you suddenly by chance gained the insight that was achieved by the Buddha after cultivating the Perfections (paramita) over numerous LIFETIMES. It just doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me that there would be some kind of short cut that monastics and other people pursuing enlightenment (most often through a lifetime commitment) simply don't use. Supposing these substances really did lead to any level of enlightnement, he specifically spoke against drugs and alcohol.

Some things that demotivate us are:

- Creative constrains we over exaggerate. If we are limited

- Too much pressure on the outcome. Well, but too much importance as to be frozen in our place, is the same as not caring at all. Don't worry, if it doesn't work, well, you did your best.

- Fears in general. We fear critics, mockery, etc. It's ok to consider them, but again, if they are freezing you to death, it's of no use. Just lower it a little bit. Don't worry to much about it.

This brand of Christianity is the ultimate ego-driven philosophy - hence my username. It fosters guilt as a mechanism to keep you crawling back on your knees asking for forgiveness. Guilt about your actions, even the very essence of who you are. It creates a subservient ego-image that you must identify with... and to hate. I hated myself for almost 20 years as a dirty sinner. It also creates a separate image - God - that is just a secondary projection of one's own ideas and desires. 

It is a system of denial and isolation... a system of condemnation - of others and of yourself... they are learning that everyone else who does not believe as they do will burn in hell... they are learning that everyone who does not agree with them is God's enemy

I can see them becoming who I was. I almost didn't escape it; and most do not. I can't keep them away from my family yet. We live together... they are too young for me to be able to teach them to think critically... they just believe the stories that they are told without question.

So I've been thinking about this a lot lately, not because it's so complicated, but because it sounds so utterly simple that people often just dismiss it as a platitude.

The biggest thing I've taken from Buddhism, instead of constantly dwelling in the past or future. I was sitting at work today, in one of the most tedious, mind numbing jobs I've ever experienced. I was beyond bored. There has to be a new word for it, because it felt like I was on the verge of insanity. Minutes where stretching like hours. Every time I looked at the clock, I couldn't help but do the mental math of how many hours and minutes until the end of the day. Thinking of how much I wanted to be away from here, away from the present moment. It was this realization that made me realize that I was basically performing the opposite of mindfulness. Instead of being here in the present moment paying attention to what was happening right now, to the sounds and actions around me, the more miserable I felt. When boredom sets in, and I just felt worse and worse the more I thought about how bored I was

SO I tried something. Whenever I thought I was bored, it dissipated. Try as I might, I couldn't observe it as it was happening. Why is this? Where did it go? So from that, I came up with a theory.

Boredom is just an expression of the desire to be ""somewhere else"". The more you live in another moment, the worse the present moment seems. When you long to be away from the present moment, the present moment seems dull and horrible by comparison, because you create an idealized version of what ""not now"" is in your mind. But when you come back to the present moment, when you really analyze what's going on, you realize it isn't so bad. Hell, it isn't bad at all. The more I tried to stay in the present, the less I felt bored, I was actively reducing suffering on an observable level. Sometimes it would get away from me

I see this ""present moment"" philosophy in a lot of places in my life. Idealizing future moments and past moments, and as any Buddhist will tell you, later is never now. It's always later. By putting things off to a moment that never comes, they never get done. but when I decided ""I'm going to do it, right now, present moment. The only moment that's here""

A)They didn't seem so bad
B) Shit actually gets done

I've been trying to live as much as possible in teh ""Eternal Now"" now. You never realize how much unhappiness and suffering is caused by living elsewhere until you actively observe yourself doing it, and you find yourself thinking about what fun stuff you'll do when you get home, stop it. Stop living in the future. Focus on the now, think about what you're doing, what's going on around you/ Whenever your brain starts to drift away formt he now, drag it back. When you do this, you don't even think about the clock. Living in the now is the biggest cure to boredom I've found.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/kdr4z/what_buddhist_philosophy_has_provided_to_my/

I'm going to start be stating that it's not meant as an offense. It doesn't mean ""you're wrong"". It doesn't mean ""you shouldn't believe that"". It just means that the opinion doesn't agree with Buddhism.

Keep in mind that Buddhism is a religion. It has many (many many) religious texts. It has a long line of religious leaders. It has a heritage of concepts and the interpretation thereof.

That's what Buddhism is like. An established religion.

Problem is, they say ""this is what the Buddha actually say"".

    Materialities are like balls of foam

    Perceptions are like mirages
    Volitions are like banana trees
    Consciousnesses are like magical illusions. 
    -Samyutta Nikaya

Just as balls of foam on ocean waves break apart and disappear

Feelings are like ephemeral bubbles on water; they arise due to momentary conditions

""For one cannot grasp a mirage and drink it, or fill a pot with it...And just as a mirage deceives travelers and makes them say that a full lake has been seen, perception also deceives them and makes them say 'this is blue, beautiful, pleasant and permanent'.""

The scope of the aggregate of mental formations is vast. Although experiences are composed of many mental factors that function together to form the interdependent state

Consciousness is reckoned by the particular condition dependent upon which it arises. When consciousness is reckoned by eye and materiality it is considered eye-consciousness.  There is no pre existing consciousness just waiting for a perception to impinge. Consciousness contains no intrinsic qualities; it simply performs the function of cognizing whatever object impacts the senses.

They have a right to think it’s weird or boring or stupid

The most terrifying creation you make and share is your self. We’re not born with a self

You make yourself from the books you read

So when you share that it’s terrifying because you know people have a right to dislike it 

When you meet a stranger you make a ‘you’ inside of them

That’s why we all fear judgement. People make a ‘you’ inside of them and you don’t want that ‘you’ to be wrong 

That’s why feeling scared or sad is so beautiful. Being scared shows just how much you care about the ‘you’ you’ve made

The best way to get over this fear is not to hide from it

Keep creating for your friends and your family and your idols and your peers in spite of the fear

“To Make you the ‘you’ that you feel best inside of” – Hank Green

""The fear doesn’t go away; you just get more comfortable in it""


This is a sort of 'idea' of the way the mind and consciousness works when thinking about other people. How do you feel about this?

How do we overcome this fear? Do we embrace it? Do we separate ourselves from it? Is the fear all irrational? I'm curious to see what a Buddhist type of 'conclusion' for this problem is.

I have seen some of you troubled by this concept. This one and also the attachment ones. There are more things in Buddhism than those two concepts... For real. Don't stress that much on them.

The way some are approaching it is like if you wanted to explain a kid who has never seen ice what ice is and you told them: it's the state in which two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen are when they get under 0º C. It's accurate, not so much at that point. It's more easy, far better, more complete explanation to just show him the ice and put it in his hand.

Buddhism is not taught like the "" two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen"" example. This is just forcing the knowledge, to know, accept and understand your actions, to know, accept and understand your nature... The same with the emotions, actions and nature of others. To understand what really happens around you, what things are and aren't, to be able to experience it. To see your mind as it is.

After you understand these and many other things

All teachings are incredibly easy to obtain

Noble Eightfold path, karma, rebirth... you are eating the cake before the party.

Have you fixed your problems with your family? Are you able to face your problems or even recognize them? Are the causes of what's happening to you fully clear? Does your mind feels clear only when meditating but not long after stopping meditation? Does the behavior of others seems impossible to understand? Does your feelings seem impossible to understand? Do you feel unable to keep yourself motivated? Does your fears stop you from doing what you want? Do you find easy to do what's uneasy or hard for you?

If the answer to any of those were a ""no"" then you are indeed studying advanced things out of time when studying karma

If you sincerely answered ""yes"" to them all then feel free to ignore this post.

Otherwise please understand that studying some things out of time in buddhism will only make you view them out of context and may mislead you.

* Me: ...
* Brain: No
* Me: I should stop at 7/11 and grab some coke and chips!
* Brain: Exactly! Coke and chips! Coke and Chips!
* Mindfulness: That feeling of craving sure is growing stronger...
* Brain: (singing) coke and chips

I have two goals right now that haven't been going well. The first is consuming less junk and the second is saving money. Coke

* Me: Wait a sec

And that was it. The craving disolved immeditately. I doubt this is a magic bullet but the acknowledgement of my greater goals and framing the scenario such that I was gaining by abstaining my brain shifted gears automatically.

With the exception of a few individuals (such as /r/buddhism) the majority of people seem to be going the other way ... much of it seems economics based (ie media and companies telling us what to do).

Society (media) tells us that we're not good looking enough. We need plastic surgery, etc etc. We are told that desiring to look different is good. We're told to strive for beauty that we can never achieve. We spend billions of dollars on products that give us a few moments of beauty but never true happiness. 

Desire is everywhere. TV tells us to desire money and wealth. We desire expensive cars (or just a newer car than the one we've got). We desire gold watches and iPhones. We desire addictive cigarettes and instant hamburgers.

We work and rush and focus on making money ... and ignore all the wonderful things that are already around us. We hate our jobs

Generally we treat each other like shit. We're mean to our families and friends

Corporations are greedy and are doing serious harm to society and the environment. They feed us junk food and then tell us we're ugly. They poison the environment and air so that we can drive to work 5 minutes faster. They hoard money

I'm just ranting here ... and I know I'm very much a part of western society too. I desire things (even though I try not to). I own an iphone. I work because I need the money. I get angry at people for really stupid reasons. 

I'm just saying that although I personally try to do my best and I try to study Buddhism and become more mindful I'm honestly mediocre at it.

I've treated people of all kinds, with the same basic solutions; so your problem might probably not be so unfamiliar to me.

I have also gone from most states, but many, and many from the common life, so again, I think your situation might not be so unfamiliar to me.

- The belief in a permanent personality
- Doubt
- Attachment to rites
- Attachment to sense desires
- Ill-will

So you might ask me up to that level of understanding.

I know the sub-reddit isn't too friendly to all claims of achievements or the like, hoping people will try to get and focus on something good about it for themselves, instead of focusing on negative things for themselves or others. But either way it's fine.

&gt; Traditionally
&gt; 1. ""What is there?""  
&gt; 2. ""What is it like?"" 

&gt; A person who studies metaphysics is called a metaphysicist or a metaphysician. The metaphysician attempts to clarify the fundamental notions by which people understand the world, [objects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy\)) and their [properties](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_(philosophy\)), [space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space) and [time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time), [cause and effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality), and [possibility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possibility_(disambiguation\)).  

&gt; A central branch of metaphysics is [ontology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology)

&gt; Prior to the modern [history of science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_science), however, transformed natural philosophy into an [empirical](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical) activity deriving from [experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment) unlike the rest of philosophy. By the end of the 18th century, it had begun to be called ""science"" to distinguish it from philosophy. Thereafter, metaphysics denoted philosophical enquiry of a non-empirical character into the nature of existence.

I find lots of Buddhism fascinating, compassion, non-dualistic principles, the present being the only reality). However there's a few things that completely put me off the practice or any deeper engagement with it:

- There seems to be some element of dogma implied in 'right' and 'wrong' view which seems to undermine the aim of seeing reality 'as it is'. If reality is visible beyond words and once we stop mindlessly thinking/using the monkey mind, but follow these exact principles otherwise you'll never be enlightened!) In addition, the Buddha is referenced in Walpola Rahula's 'What the Buddha Taught' as describing the lifestyle of everyone else as 'low' and 'common' - which seems so derogatory and lacking in compassion as it was taught. Linking to what I said above, 'everyone is fighting a tough battle', and there's surely, logically, many routes to seeing what the Buddha saw in life.

- Enlightenment has been described as something where one doesn't 'become' enlightened, there is a reference made to the fact that 'there is nothing after enlightenment'. I don't understand how this makes sense in a world which is always changing and that even the state of mind associated with enlightenment will come to an end. The way it seems to be described, it is almost worded as if enlightenment was a cosmic switch that ensured you'd never return to dukkha - but if rebirth is how I understand it, you'd just be enlightened for the rest of your life. Is that it?

- What is the difference, versus anyone else who just so happens to be a nice person (or even someone who understands non-duality/'we are all stardust', etc.)? I've heard it being described that 'compassionate' acts from someone who is not enlightened are not truly compassionate acts because they feed the ego, but surely the money donated to charity, or the time you went out there to help local communities, is of the same value regardless of your enlightened status?

- The ego, followed by two weeks of the deepest depression and de-personalisation. What's the point in doing anything at all if there is no self? Of looking for jobs. Of trying to help others (they're not real either!). Even if it is understood as 'there is no permanent self' - which makes more sense, I end up feeling guilty and overanalysing everything I do because 'that's just the ego talking'. I wind up with no self-esteem (if there's no self, there's no esteem!), no motivation to do anything, even helpful things. However, when I view it as 'if I help you, so everybody wins', seemingly

- Most of all, that engaging fully with Buddhism is such a crazy risk. I do not want to feel, after 10 years of self-denial, sitting peacefully and acknowledging the truths of existence, that I have wasted my youth on something unprofitable. Life has many paths, and often it does not matter which small decisions are made in terms of overall happiness. But Buddhism as I understand it (and I'm sure I've completely misunderstood some things) seems like a huge gamble to make when full of life and health. I can only see it as useful when terminally ill, when a loved one has died, you can probably find inner peace and comfort whilst waiting for death. But when full of life, nature around me, opportunities for compassion and wisdom - why not just roll with it with an open mind

A major obstacle to sitting every day is - get this - not sitting every day. Days go by

But if we look to almost any creative field, one simply must practice every day. There is a **qualitative** difference between playing your guitar (or writing a story) 30 minutes a day for seven days and playing once a week for 210 minutes. 

The form, the weather or that simply unmissable show playing on TV. It's as if the act of simply respecting the daily schedule rewards you in some subtle, immeasurable way. (Yes, I know, rewards and attachments to rewards are very bad things.)

1320413589.0,m08xy,A little meditative practice I like to do. Got any more like this to share?,thenaturalmind,62,8,13,"This one is based on noting. Noting is a helpful meditative technique that has its basis in MN 111

If you aren't sure how to note, but it just doesn't vibe with some people, and it does take some time to get comfortable with. Your mileage may vary. Anyway, here she is:

**Noting The 4 Foundations of Mindfulness**

(More about the four foundations in the [satipatthana sutta](http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.010.than.html).)

1. Set up a timer or bell to ring every 5 minutes. [Here's one](http://fungie.info/bell/). Sit for at least 20 minutes so you can get through all 4 foundations.
 
1. The Four Foundations you will be noting are **body sensations** (pressure, warmth, tension, pain, etc.), **feeling tone** (pleasant, unpleasant, **mindstates** (calm, confused, and **thoughts/mental images** (practice-thought

1. Basically you will note body sensations for 5 minutes, etc. If you haven't noted before just relax and trust yourself, don't get stressed trying to find the perfect label, and start slow. Noting, like everything else, gets very easy with practice.

**Why Do This?**

Your normal routine may be to quiet the mind, so this may sound weird to you. Here's why I find noting awesome:

1. **Noting destroys narrative threads and makes ruminative thought almost impossible**. When noting I find I am distracted less since long neurotic strings of content-type stuff (my personal stories and anxieties) are simply reduced to disconnected sensations. Perceiving these sensations distinctly means they aren't weaving together into hypnotic stories. My thought loops and analysis regarding that girl I really like now become: tension, worry-thought, etc. 

2. **Noting builds concentration**. The nice thing about noting is that it's very obvious when you've become distracted (noting stops). Also, and diverting it to the technique, so it's much less likely to run off and do it's own thing. I find I can get very concentrated while noting, to the point where there are no gaps in my awareness of whatever sensations are arising, for long stretches of time.

3. **Noting works extremely well off-cushion.** If you are only mindful during your formal sits

4. **Noting sets you up for insight into the three characteristics.** Learning to perceive the three characteristics in real-time is an ability that noting cultivates big-time. Amidst all of these flickering

Those are just a few benefits. You can read more glowing reviews here: [The Benefits of Noting](http://thehamiltonproject.blogspot.com/2011/04/yogi-tool-box-benefits-of-noting.html).

For example, in above water conditions, it would mostly be air). This is why it's conceptual, because ""nothing"" only exists as a concept; in reality it doesn't exist, it's abstract and fictitious.

To understand void it's more easy if we see it as the hard drive of a computer. The hard drive represents space; in this space things come to manifestation (not existence because they neither exist nor not exist at this point, when we don't have a particular manifestation of energy/existence-itself (say atoms), it's empty or void. But this doesn't mean the ""space"" isn't there, like in a hard drive that is empty it doesn't mean that it has no the space to write in information. So in this way, something might be empty, but not ""not-existent"" or ""nothingness"".

Being happy is like holding water in your hands. If you cup your hands just so, like everything else, is transient. Worse, the more you strive for it, the more you cling to it the faster it dissolves. Like a butterfly, happiness comes along without bidding, is beautiful to see, but if you try to catch it

Happiness happens to us. We are happy when we are having coffee with a loved one. Or walking a favorite trail. But soon

Instead of seeking happiness

But we can construct joy through truth. 

If you have ever felt joy

Contentment is simply the understanding that all is the way it should be.  If you understand that there is no time but now

Taking this a bit further, right now. You cannot be different.

I truly believe that everyone does the best they can

This does not mean that you should not do what you can at this point to become more skillful. That is the best you can do. We are all pointing our arrows toward targets.

The future is an illusion, the past is an illusion, everything is an illusion. I fell into the rabbit hole and I know, that there is no getting out. 

Now I am faced with two options as I see it. Option 1: step back from the precipice and medicate myself into the material world, loathing, and possible self-destruction. Or, Option 2: plunge myself even deeper into the rabbit hole. Truly let go of ""myself"". Dive into the unknown headlong until finding what lies beneath. People tell me this is a good thing. I am on the cusp of realizing my full potential as a human being. The word ""enlightenment"" is getting tossed around a lot. But why then does it feel like I've suddenly become a raving lunatic?

So now, I feel grateful that I have another opportunity to come into the present. It makes meditation a more positive and enjoyable experience for me. Maybe it will do the same for you!",,False,self,t5_2qhnf,False,,

1341086328.0,vupom,"About a quarter of the way into ""Siddhartha"" by Hermann Hesse when I found this thought provoking quote.",inspired221,59,8,52,"**Quote:**

""And -- thus my thought, oh venerable one, in words and through teachings what has happened to you in the hour of enlightenment! The teachings of the enlightened Buddha contain much, it teaches many to live righteously, to avoid evil. But there is one thing which these so clear, these so venerable teachings do not contain: they do not contain the mystery of what the exalted one has experienced for himself, he alone among hundreds of thousands.""

**Context:** 

Siddhartha is the protagonist of the novel and he has come to the Buddha because of the stories surrounding this enlightened man.

Siddhartha is talking with the Buddha about staying with him to learn his teachings but Siddhartha is not very convinced that he can learn what he truly seeks. In a very eloquent tone the Buddha explains that he teaches salvation from suffering and nothing else. 

**Conversation before the quote:**

Siddhartha replies --
""I have not doubted in you for a single moment. I have not doubted for a single moment that you are Buddha, on your own path, through thoughts, through meditation, through realizations, through enlightenment. It has not come to you by means of teachings!""
