Last week
A detour commenced, thankfully he had paper towels in his truck and we were able to cover her gash as I called for an ambulance. She was responsive, quietly insisting that she was fine and she only had a bloody nose (the chunk of flesh on the ground next to her begged to differ). We learned her name and her age (80) and tried to keep her talking, even if she gave one word answers. 
The medics arrived and thanked me for calling and keeping her conscious. I silently thanked Snack Exchange for putting me in the right place at the right time.

1303684139.0,gwk38,IAmA: Real life customs officer. A simple set of requests before the trading frenzy.,CustomsCartman,152,25,52,"Greetings

I rarely talk about work but seeing as hundreds of you are about to ship food internationally I figured I'd drop in using this one off and make a simple list of requests to try to prevent someone's act of kindness from becoming a biological disaster of epic proportions.

I know there are a lot of people around here that are suspicious and/or dismissive of pretty much all forms of government regulation on their personal actions. However

First the good news candy

The moderators have a decent list in their FAQ on what to send/not send and it really is a great idea to check with your the relevant websites of the country you are sending to or your post office if they have that kind of info. But here are a few things that are banned  pretty much everywhere. (Note: Intra EU shipments are pretty much fair game from what I can tell. )

Fresh fruit, home pickled fruit. 

Any kind of processed stone fruit (think peaches) that still have the pit inside of them. 

Fresh leaves or bark. 

Meat, smoked, or pickled meats. Fish is ok in some places, but not in others (Australia bans most fish for example). Some states are more permissive than others so check before sending. Send absolutely nothing you killed and prepared yourself (and yes that includes jerky.)

Seeds and nuts that aren't commercially roasted. Don't be a dick on this one. It takes one under cooked or uncooked seed to start an invasion.

Live birds or birds nests (yes people eat both)

Home cooked eggs and baked good that contain whole eggs within (aka mooncakes). 

I know a lot of you just read the list and thought ""WHY THE FUCK WOULD I SEND THAT???"" but if this job has taught me anything it's almost anything digestible is considered a snack SOMEWHERE in the world. 

Now a word on packing

If you reuse an old box for international shipments please make ABSOLUTELY SURE the box is clean

Don't use straw

Also no burlap bags

No solid wood packing of pretty much any kind. To include wooden internal supports in boxes or external wooden frames (I can't imagine anyone is going to send enough this would be necessary but I'm throwing it in there just in case. 

Finally if you aren't sure make sure to declare the food. The most that will happen is the offending items will be removed and the package will be sent on its way. If you fail to declare and the items get intercepted the wait time for the box is usually much longer and in some countries they just destroy the whole damn thing. 

Ok

Edited to reiterate that this isn't an all inclusive list. Australia and New Zealand are a lot more restrictive than say China for example. If you have any questions check with the local countries web sites most are easy to find.

1302548657.0,gnlib,IMPOTENT ANNOUNCEMENT! We're having our first mass exchange!,happybadger,130,19,51,"Just kidding

TOMHORSERY! 

No but seriously

Registration for this is open as of now, as they say in Detroit. They don't fucking say that in Detroit, Happybadger. You fucking LIE. 

No but seriously, truly bleeding vile. 

*BIG ASS SNACK EXCHANGE:*

- Normal trades will be going on simultaneously as normal. The mass exchange is **OFF-SITE** at [**redditgifts.com**](http://redditgifts.com/exchanges/snacks/). If it's anything like Secret Santa/mixcd

- If you're one of those vegan chaps with the vegetables and the bitching and the hating AMERICAN VALUES

- /r/badkarma won't be the place to deal with bad trades. A few of you will get *jipped* (which is now offensive to the Roma

- Homemade is a-okay

- If you send pure drugs or prostitutes

- Vanilla coke is *so fucking good*. 

- Suggested trade cost, maybe. That's prohibitively expensive for some and you *may* be able to find someone willing to courier it in /r/favors. Domestic shipping is almost always pretty damn cheap and you could shave $10-20 off the final price doing that.

- Please post pictures of your hoard on the redditgifts.com website when you receive it. That's kind of a tradition here because everyone loves snacks. 

- Please direct questions about this to /r/secretsanta or through the redditgifts.com website. This may be based around /r/snackexchange but it's as new to me as it is to you. 

- Signups will probably close fairly quickly. Don't lollygag you lollygagging son of a lollygagger. 

- Bullet point.

What I'm proposing is a simple rule. Before any trade is sent off

1. Unless you're trading with someone from Darfur, you can afford to blow $30 on snacks, and you don't live in a rural African village where Sesame Street is E for ebola and big bird is vomiting blood on live television. 

2. You can't just tape a box shut and take a picture of it. It has to show the snacks. If someone is spending $20 on specific snacks

3. Both users get a picture. Both users know that the other person is actually interested in the exchange. Friendship.

This would be linked on the top and on the sidebar. Both users would have one week from agreeing to the exchange to post a picture to each other

Lots of times, I know that it's a pain not to be able to get something that you want, and initially, I got a kick out of being able to help.  Most everyone has been great, and though the cashiers look at me funny when I buy trolleys full of jammie dodgers and jaffa cakes, I've had a blast.

My last two exchanges went a little sour.  One person asked for conditioner only available in the UK, and mail between our two countries does not take that long.  Another person asked for kool-aid.  I got one of every flavor our commissary sells, and sent them posthaste.  When asked what I'd like in exchange, I told him.  I received nothing, not even replies to my inquiries.  Again, he's in the UK, too

It just seems to me that a few people have ruined it for me.  If you're going to be part of r/snack exchange, and not receive one in return.  Things do go wonky with the mail from time to time, but not keeping communication open is kind of suspicious.  That's it, I guess.  Thanks for reading my rant.

**Making a post:**

- The most important thing to consider in your title is your location. Not only do shipping costs vary wildly between countries

- Context is another good thing to include. What you're trading

- Here is an example title and subtext from my perspective: [Title: (FRA) Trading culinary lavender

**Setting up the trade:**

- If someone messages you or comments, but use account activity and gut feeling as your guide rather than arbitrary numbers). You are trading at your own peril here, as the mods don't have the tools to help you if it goes south. Avoid trading with new accounts or very inactive accounts as a rule of thumb.

- Again, you're giving a stranger off the street $50 in sweets and telling them to give you $50 in sweets the next day. 

- Don't be pushy or rude. Propriety goes a long way. 

- Don't demand real-world identities. Some of us are totally okay with linking our usernames to our real names, very obviously not my name (""Happy Badger"" in Romanian), and have never been returned to me or rejected by customs. Just write ""Reddit"" as their surname. 

- It's a good idea to exchange pictures of the postmarked boxes before sending them off just so you know that your exchangee is serious about it. Obviously the contents are another story

- **Make note of anything you cannot receive and why.** This cannot be stressed enough. If your immune system hates you or there are cultural, it's your responsibility to speak up for yourself. 

**Readying your package:**

- First, even if they've not mentioned it. **FAILURE TO ABIDE BY CUSTOMS RULES MAY RESULT IN YOUR PACKAGE BEING CONFISCATED.**

- Please don't include illegal drugs. To save my own arse I have to ban any users which send illegal drugs. If you decide to ignore this warning

- Package everything securely. All couriers are bad. All couriers will beat your package like an Irishman's wife. Wrap things in a way that ensures they won't break. It's also a bad idea to include things which may break

- Fill out all customs forms as accurately as possible. **This is very, and don't give them any reason to open your package. 

- Be mindful of couriers. Some couriers won't carry alcohol, USPS, etc) and when to use a private courier (Fedex, UPS, etc) is very important. 

**Receiving your package:**

- Give it a few weeks, but do ask for a tracking number (NOTE: The receipt number sometimes functions as one. They will always receive a receipt when sending the package through a post office) once just so that you're aware of the status of the package. 

- If a tracking number costs extra

- It's a good idea to have your exchangee include a package note which tells the courier where to put your package

- Please make a picture post showing off your package's contents. This does two things. First, they're pretty much the entire reason I made the subreddit. **If you make a picture post, please censor the shipping label.** Any identifying information is fair game to anyone viewing the photo, and there are some sick people out there. Black out names, addresses, and tracking numbers. 

- Please message the mod(s) with a link to a picture post of your package by your exchangee. We'll give you an AK-47 for that,False,,t5_2rqyn,True,,ak47,t3_q73dc

1. People are inherently good. Persons can be overwhelmingly shit. Unnecessary cynicism is denying the former and worrying about a subset of the latter.

2. It may not be that we're having an upswing

Now for whatever reason

We've more than doubled our population over the last year, there really isn't anything we can do to prevent this without going off-site like Redditgifts, but unless it's adding bold tags to something I couldn't code a 10 print hello world. 

**The vast majority of trades still go through just fine**. I would estimate that 90-95% of trades have no issues and the bulk of the remaining are customs fuckups or simple misunderstandings. The number of reported actual predators on here is so low that you probably have a better chance at being mugged walking down your street than you do being robbed here. 

However

1. Only trade with AK-47 holders if possible. In all the fallen-through trades

2. **CHECK USERPAGES**. That day-old account may be here for the community, 10.000 combined karma. That's my arbitrary number for considering an account trustworthy. If you want to play exceedingly safe, that's a good number to follow. Does it mean that anyone under it is out to fuck you? Not at all, but statistically they're far more likely to. 

2. Only send if you have either confirmation that your exchangee has sent (tracking number

3. Send confirmation of some sort when you send your box, just let them know that something personal got in the way of you posting. If you want, message a moderator and we can do that for you. This is not a free pass and you are still responsible for sending a package, but a few weeks' delay isn't apocalyptic.

4. Make sure both you and your exchangee know customs regulations for the countries you're sending FROM and TO. Customs agents are cops who failed their psych exam. They take this out on everything that passes through their facility. If you aren't up to date on their arbitrary regulations

5. Give it a few weeks. Especially with transoceanic packages, four to six is still probably on the low side. Until that time frame is up, don't worry. 

6. You're responsible for your own safety. I'm reiterating this because it pisses me off tremendously. We don't have tools beyond a ban button. Banning does nothing when making a new account is a ten second affair. If we could we'd watch over every exchange like a helicopter mum, [go here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins) and request better mod tools relating to real-world interaction.

The pros of receiving a Kinder Egg are obvious: the chocolate is great and there's a special prize inside. However

1) The box goes unnoticed by customs. The recipient gets his egg and everyone wins (common

2) Customs notices the eggs, and puts the prize and wrapper back in your box. http://i.imgur.com/GS7xx.jpg 
(Fairly common

3) Customs seizes your eggs and sends you a letter saying you can pay a large fee to receive the remnants (rare

4) Customs seizes the whole box

A) A major delay in delivery
B) A snacker never receiving their parcel. 

This is extremely rare

The route they take usually is 1 or 2

After the risk analysis, the higher the risk.

1339686314.0,v1q8l,I've been on a quest for a specific Solen candy bar for 7 years. Anyone in the Middle East (or elsewhere) that can help? USA/California trade in return :) (Full story in comments),mildcaseofdeath,52,6,16,"I'm a new poster here

I was in Iraq in 2005, and it was love at first bite: it's a 3x2 egg crate of wafer (like in a Kit Kat), with each little ""bowl"" filled with chocolate creme; more chocolate creme 'glues' a flat piece of the same wafer on top; the whole thing is dipped in chocolate; then flip the whole thing over and each little ""mound"" is drizzled in a contrasting chocolate. There's nothing like it in the US, and I immediately bought a whole box.

I developed a habit...I'd brave the heat and rocket/mortar attacks (literally) to go to the little shop to buy a box of 12 for $6 USD - or 24 for $12 USD, we moved FOBs and I couldn't regularly find them anymore. The last time I found one I [saved the wrapper](http://i.imgur.com/9QIjP.jpg) so I could [get more sometime](http://i.imgur.com/RX6oV.jpg). (Never mind the little flashlight in the pics, I needed it to hold the wrapper flat...for scale purposes though that flashlight holds one AA battery.) The wrapper has (I think) Turkish, Russian, Arabic, and English on it, making me suspect they may be export only...but not to the US.

I've had that wrapper for 7 years

I offer a trade from the US/California for a case (or ten haha) of these awesome Solen Vip bars. That goes for US servicemen and women as well (care package, and many other interesting things. Just let me know what you'd like/what's legal for me to send you. I don't have sky-high karma but this is my primary/serious bidness account, and I have no intention of scamming anyone. Just want to invite over a couple Army buddies and nostalgia *hard* over some awesome candy bars. So can anyone help? :) And again, sorry for the wall of text/exhaustive backstory.

Edit #1: a very helpful redditor found me some links; emails have been sent, I'd eat a pallet of them, I just hope they're not prohibitively expensive. I'm still open to trades however, considering it's more fun that way (and likely faster and less expensive).",,False,,1339725423.0,t3_v1q8l

1307852954.0,hxl0m,"Don't buy from Edible.com. No tracking, TERRIBLE customer service, and I'm not even sure they sent out my gift.",readyfuels,53,22

Long story short, I asked if I could cancel my order on Edible, saying that I hadn't meant to order because I thought that was less tacky than saying ""I'm a broke asshole."" Got an email back saying I could change the address, but not cancel. Clearly that didn't help, so I left it and moved on with life.

Two weeks later, nothing. A little concerning, so I e-mail. No response. Day before three weeks since ordering, still no response and my giftee doesn't have his gift. So I e-mail again, this time with a bit more concern (still polite, though), asking if it had been shipped, etc.

I get the following response

&gt;Your order was sent over 2 weeks ago

&gt;**It was not our fault you made an order as a joke** - we are running a business here.
&gt;
&gt;As it says on our website your order is subject to US customs clearance at your risk and you need to be patient.
&gt;**We do not use tracking numbers** with AIrmail.

""It's not our fault you made an order as a joke."" I never said I was. I said I wanted to cancel my order and didn't mean to make it. 

""You need to be patient."" It was going to be three weeks to the day the following day

Also

I sent my first ever angry customer email back without really thinking

&gt;You should expect this anytime in the next week as long as US customs does not stop it

And that's it. Giftee has not received his package, with absolutely no proof, that it was shipped, and that it was seized by customs.

If it's not there by Wednesday

Meanwhile

**TL;DR:** Don't buy shit from Edible.com. They don't track packages and are rude as hell if you dare to ask for one.",,t5_2rqyn,False,,ak47,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/snackexchange/comments/hxl0m/dont_buy_from_ediblecom_no_tracking_terrible/

He didn't respond to me, and so I've banned [Yammerman](http://www.reddit.com/user/yammerman) from the subreddit. 

This is a subreddit built on trust, not lost shipping costs. If you're a cunt, I will ban you. If you've been the victim of a cunt, please contact me via PM because I rarely, if ever, check the mod messages (too much /r/TIL).

Yet next to me sits a lovely box of gifts for my Secret Santa that I can't wait to send to hopefully make her smile.  I guess I just don't understand how people can accept something like what I sent that I put a lot of thought and time into and a nice letter.  Mike, Mike, is that you took advantage of a 31 year old woman on disability who has a rare kind of endocrine cancer and is trying to get help from specialists outside of my home country.  
So the next time you, remember that you don't ever really know the sacrifices someone is making to send a smile your way.

Edit:  I went to bed last night just wanting to vent and I wake up to see so much more amazingness from Reddit.  The majority of this community is amazing.  I want each of you to know that.  To answer some of the questions, after I sent him his tracking number.  The snack exchange was my Dutch snacks for his American snacks.  And to give you an idea, I didn't ask for much really....I just wanted some baking soda to bake with when I can because I can't find it anywhere in the Netherlands, hah!  And some cream cheese icing which is one thing I really miss.
The reason I decided to make this post was to just make people who participate a little bit more aware.  You don't know how little or how much the person behind their user name has.  What I wanted 'Mike' to know is that despite trying to live on $700 USD a month and being disabled
I appreciate, but I would just feel wrong letting someone else spend their hard earned money on me.  If you'd really like to send me something, you can always send a postcard from your corner of the planet. :)  You all really are amazing; thank you again.",,False,,t5_2rqyn,,http://www.reddit.com/r/snackexchange/comments/n108g/an_international_snack_exchange_partner_took/

Now obviously you can only trade this to people with medical licenses

That being said

1. Boil/steam off labels. This is especially important if you're trading overseas as customs tends to open things and a giant pot leaf can't be a good thing for them to find. Make your own label instead

2. If making your own magic snacks, especially mushrooms and cannabis (anxiety), and it's not fun to trip when you're not expecting it.

About a month ago I made a thread offering Swedish sweets and snacks in exchange for skittles. Snoron sent me a PM and we started talking and such but when I found out the shipping rates for sending packages from Sweden I told him that I couldn't send him candy because it would be too expensive for me. 

But what I did not know was that Snoron was a GGG. He sent me another PM a few days after i had told him that i could trade with him, and all thanks to SNORON! :D

Thank You Snoron for the Skittles

shipping rate was too expensive

Now most of this stuff I don't use. It tells a story, that my stuff tells the story of me, has gotten me thinking. 

r/Snackexchange exists because I want people to quite literally take candy from strangers and because I want them to experience other cultures. It's an exercise in trust and in cosmopolitanism, just where they live.

A box of stuff, not so much spatulas and rubbish but things that tell your life story without words, and send it to your exchangee along with a letter explaining everything. They would in-turn send you a box of stuff, and then when they're received you post the standard picture thread.

Anyway

**Verified email**: This means *nothing*. If you make an email account and press a button, ever, ever mistake it for anything other than meaningless.

**AK-47/Pizza Slice:** This means *everything*. A user with an AK-47 (you need to enable custom styles in order to see it I believe) is one who has traded in either /r/snackexchange, or participated in the Redditgifts.com Snack Exchange #1. The mods of this subreddit and the aforementioned personally inspect every user granted an AK-47 like the Securitate or some shit, and they can all be trusted to send again. Pizza slices are no different, they're just given if you absolutely cannot have a gun next to your name (think religious and personal conflict).

**Other Emblems:** Eventually I'd love to round up all of the exchange subreddits and consolidate our flair lists

Always always always look for one of the above two good forms of verification before trading, the only thing we can accomplish is damage control. The only users we check are those holding AK-47s, and we check them thoroughly when there aren't any pictures of farm animals around. *Thoroughly.*",,False,,t5_2rqyn,,http://www.reddit.com/r/snackexchange/comments/so7bv/different_types_of_user_verification_and_you_a/

*Things to be aware of before starting an exchange:*

* Check their user profile
* Search [/r/BadKarma](http://reddit.com/r/BadKarma) for their username

**This person looks legit

* Voice any and ALL problem-foods for you
* Agree on a budget, prepare and understand ahead of time!
* Exchange addresses.
* Notify on shipment. If possible

**Alright

*How and what to ship:*

* Ensure that the items you have chosen to send actually CAN be sent. Problem foods typically meats
* Check '[The Successful Jewish Fisherman's Guide to International Customs Notes](http://www.reddit.com/r/snackexchange/comments/ck7rd/customs_declaration_what_do_we_write/)' for customs information.

We're going to exchange Christmaskahzaawhateveratheistscelebrate. We're going to exchange it and we're going to celebrate it. To keep this brief because I owe someone 2000g on Warcraft

From now until 31 December, then posty posterson. 

These are special trades, here's what you'll be sending:

- At least one snack that symbolises your country/faith/holiday of choice's way of celebrating.

- Some sort of trinket that pertains to your country/faith/holiday's way of celebrating. Maybe a Christmas tree ornament

- Some sort of brief guide to how you do things in your house/country/faith. Maybe write out a list of popular prayers or songs or a recipe for something your grandmother would make when you were a little tyke. 

Obviously anything beyond that is up to you and your partner, this should cost around $30-50 max (roughly going on how much it costs to send emergency peanut butter shipments back to friends in England). If that's out of your league, /r/favors may have some people going home for the holidays who would be willing to take your package and ship it local, saving you $20-30. 

Never Asked Questions:

- I'm not religious and this offends me

Neither am I. Let's celebrate anyways.

- Shipping costs too much for one snack

I recommend an envelope if possible

- Will my package arrive the day after I send it if I wait until Christmas Eve to make a trade? 

LOL.

- Is it really worth the hassle for one snack? 

This isn't so much about trading a snack as it is trading a tradition. Holidays really differ from country to country

- I hate [derpherp]. Can I request [herpderp] only? 

Yep. Discrimination saves the nation

- I don't celebrate anything. Can I make my own holiday

Please do. This could be interesting. 

- Will this be for other holidays too? 

Officially? Probably not. Maybe Easter and May Day. Feel free to do it unofficially though. I really want to move this subreddit in the direction of trading a slice of your country along with a slice of your country's food

- How can I help?

We're not getting a website or anything as I don't fancy maintaining one, South/Central America, Non-Australia Oceania, and Non-Oriental Asia. More people from more places means more and more interesting snacks. 

- I'm going to use this post as a platform for debating religion or something like that.

Please do that in /r/atheism. It has no place here and I will ban you without warning. This is about fun


That's about it. Happy trading. ",,t5_2rqyn,True,,ak47,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/snackexchange/comments/e1j11/forever_shalom_a_snackoon_christmas_special/

- Leave space between the box and the snacks

- Put anything that can melt on top

- On top of the cold packs place packing peanuts.

- Tape it down tightly. 

If you really want to make sure it gets there intact, then put it on a bed of packing peanuts and fill around it before sealing the cardboard box.

Pricing: $15 excluding shipping

- No psychoactive or illegal snacks

- Please mind dietary concerns

- No perishable goods unless you seal them in a way that's going to prevent spoilage. 

- No live animals unless you're trolling a Chinese guy by sending him a cat. That would be funny and I'll allow it.

- Homemade goods are allowed

- Please keep it as local as possible. Sending Skittles from Florida to Texas just isn't all that unique. If trading internationally

- Picture threads are allowed and encouraged as always. 

- Don't panic. Customs is a dick. 

- Don't be a dick. If someone's picking out their favourite snacks for you

- Someone send a live cat to a Chinese guy. The more I think about this the more I like it. 

- If someone says stop, the exchange is over. They're probably dead from high cholesterol and we encourage that.

The more I think about it, I made /r/snackshop as the place to go and will be promoting it as such.

I could go happyhitler with rules, sell in bulk, branch off with your own proper site. When we have enough shops, I'll figure out web design and make a map that charts the various shops.
