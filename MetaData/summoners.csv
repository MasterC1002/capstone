1362236097.0,19iusb,Furor boots turn snowballs into avalanches. ,blahblahhue,155,19,40,"So I really like the concept of this subreddit

Furor boots on AD carries who are winning the lane. 

The big weakness you can have bot lane is when you just cannot fight a 2v2. It's a brutal feeling of simply being out-damaged

The short story is that you spend 650G on top of your boots for an additional 12% MS speed boost. 

In rune terms

The concept is, chase them, dodge skill shots -- movement speed is one of the most brutal statistics in a perfectly played game because it allows you to do so much: Caitlyn's who stay at 650 range without relying on their E to gap close, Vayne's who pop ult and run at nearly 500 MS, etc. 

So -- what do you guys think? Obviously the big disadvantage is you need tier two boots *and then an additional 650G*. The 550G upgrade cost from tier ones to Greaves

The real increase of effective damage comes through the number of additional autoattacks you put down on the enemy. If you're not buying these boots to stay in their face the whole way through lane stage, they will likely lose. 

But if you get a lead to the point where they cannot 2v2

But enough from me. Let's here what the pro's have to say!

[1:43:17 AM] m1lk: hey dude just wanted to mention
[1:44:12 AM] m1lk: i went back and watched the replay because i didnt know if it was just circumstance (ie
[6:18:54 AM] Doublelift: furor boots  
[6:19:03 AM] Doublelift: ok on cait  
[6:19:04 AM] Doublelift: best on kog  
[6:19:18 AM] Doublelift: 650g is a lot to sink into pure mobility though  
[6:19:29 AM] Doublelift: mobility is the key to good positioning but nobody will zerg Cait anyways  
[6:19:44 AM] Doublelift: but ya **keeping a full range tether on the opponent is the highest level of outplay**

1364879223.0,1bhx3s,Some Objective Stats for All-Star Voting,Dekaor,154,23,112,"I think most of the people following LoL pro scene would agree that stats like K/D/A and Gold Per Minute aren't absolutely everything. There are obviously a lot of other factors when you evaluate a particular League of Legends professional player. To name just a few there is leadership, desire to win at all costs and many other intangibles.

However not all of those could be accurately measured

**KDA** - Average Kill Death Assist Ratio = (Kills+Assists)/Deaths

**GPM** - Gold Per Minute (rate at which gold is earned)

**Avg Gold** - how much gold a player finishes the game with

**Versatility** - number of different champions a player *had managed to win with* 

**Normalised KDA** - a player's KDA vs Team's Average KDA ratio

**KDA spread** - highest to lowest KDA swings from week to week to display consistency

3 days before it was released we predicted exactly who would pick up, we should expect a nerf. With all the knee jerk reaction in the forums from people unwilling to deviate from 'build warmogs every game', it's seeming more likely.

I wish Riot would consider making it a ranged only item before nerfing it, it will likely become niche on ADCs. While still being a brand new toy for bruisers (who don't even need it).

So yeah.

-------
I've been playing Quinn a lot on PBE. If you go glass cannon

Build I've tried: IE -&gt; BoTRK -&gt; Randuins -&gt; Warmogs

The new BoTRK gives attack speed. An interesting fact about this build: It can beat another Quinn going a standard build in a 1v1 duel due to BoTRK/Randuins passive/active. It gives her a very utility feel

This is because BoTRK can outpace IE/BT if the target is at +50% hp and only falls off at lower HP. Which becomes less of a problem the later a game goes. New BoTRK gives just 10% less attack speed than PD and more lifesteal than BT. It is 950/350 cheaper than IE/BT respectively.

What I find *most* interesting about this build is that, but the pay-off is better:

* She can start longsword, which builds into BoTRK.
* In addition to the active
* By mid-game you'll have IE, and more bonus AD than an IE -&gt; PD rush. BotRK's passive 5% current health on hit effect allows you to better deal with high HP targets, and frees you up to build defensively from here.

Randuins builds out of Warden's Mail, great.

But the passive and active are where it shines:

&gt;Passive 	Unique Passive – Cold Steel: If you are hit by a basic attack

&gt;Active 	Unique Active: Slows the movement speed of nearby enemy units by 35% for 2 (+ 0.5% total armor) (+ 0.5% total magic resistance) seconds. 60 second cooldown (500 Range).
 

You get -20% attack speed

For those keeping score, which gives both). Even less if you're in ult-form with +40-80% attack speed, and +20% movespeed in combat.

So even though they've gone standard IE/BT -&gt; PD -&gt; (Whatever)

Warmogs is subject to change, as seen by the current meta. It could even be an offensive item if you're doing well (I suggest PD, as it has been mathed out to be more effective than extra AD in terms of time to kill).

So IE -&gt; BoTRK -&gt; Randuins, and affords you the ability to get dived and kite/survive (one of the main ADC problems in S3). **Most of all I think it will help Quinn players better utilize her ultimate**, and the unique opportunity to go melee as an ADC.

I'm not saying to go this every game, which I haven't mentioned much, deals 15% of targets max HP in physical damage, heals you for that amount, and *steals* 30% of their movespeed. This has all sorts of good use, but I didn't feel the need to include it above, as the stats/passive are enough and more consistent. 

Anyways

#[**Ep. 13 - Zac of all Trades**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWjqlCX7zJk)

(We go into detail about his abilities first

*****

#**Early Game**

**Incredible sustain in jungle**

* Noticed at a certain HP
* Could take out Golems the 2nd time they spawned starting with only 100 hp.  Red/Blue could be taken with 2-300 HP very early
* Test - farm as long as possible.  I quit once I got to level 15, just to give you the idea he ain't skeered of no creeps
* Once you have high enough HP and/or Spirit Visage
* How?
* abilities cost % current HP.  Passive gives back % max HP.  So as his life gets lower


**Jungle Speed**

* Approx 4:15 clear w/o assistance at wolves/blue
* Max W first - AoE

**Ganks**

Pre-6 ganks are ok

* Gap closer knockup and slow potentially for level 2 - 3 ganks
* Damage isn’t huge
* Best he’s paired with a high damage top/mid to secure kills.

Post-6 ganks are pretty good

* E, Ult locks down enemy for quite a while and the ult will also displace them
* There isn’t much range on his Q or W

**Invading / vs Invades**

* Not an early duelist like Lee Sin
* Should be fairly resistant to invades.  Does not rely on blue buff at all for jungle clears/ganks.  He uses HP
* Has the option to start Red or Blue

**Late Game**

* Falls off in damage

*****

#**How To Build**

* Manaless AP champ with low AP ratios limits number of effective &amp; efficient items he can use
* He's going to be mostly pigeon-holed into one or two builds

**Health**

* Abilities use health (not mana
* However
* Passive (% max health heal) helps offset this cost but makes you dependent on gathering globs
* Building some HP seems good for him as both a tank and gives him a greater heal from his passive

**Spell Vamp**

* All of Zac’s abilities are AoE which doesn’t pair well with Spell Vamp (heal amount reduced to 33%).

**Ability Power**

* All of his abilities scale off of ability power but the ratios are not very good at all: .5 / .02 / .7 / .25 (QWER)

**Magic Penetration** 

* One of the better stats for Zac but only by default

**Cooldown Reduction**

* Already has low cooldowns (7 / 4 / 12 / 100 at max ranks)
* Making them even lower is one of the best and most efficient ways to increase damage 
* Q
* W
* E
* R
* However
* Nashor’s (AS)
* Going CDR boots means you can’t use a different set of boots such as Sorc or Merc treads
* Spirit Visage and Locket of the Iron Solari work
* CDR from masteries


**Two potential builds:**

1)  **CDR Utility Tank**

* more damage
* W is very spammable and does % based damage in AoE
* Can get 30% CDR using tanky items like Spirit Visage and Locket.  Pick most of the rest up from masteries
* Spirit Visage has a lot of synergy with his kit
* All these items also provide some HP which grants him more life back from using abilities
* Stacking HP doesn’t make him quite as tanky as normal since you will be spamming his abilities in team fights/skirmishes and have little time to retrieve the blobs so you want to build some Armor/MR
* Spirit Visage, Randuin’s, etc 
* 10% of his hp and 50% Ar/MR are shared by his passive ([the Terminator 2 T-1000's passive :P](http://youtu.be/e5gGV1WB-xg?t=3m1s))
* Sunfire Cape is another decent item on him that gives him some Armor, and also works well with MPen


2) **MPen build**

* since his AP ratios are low
* allows his W to do higher damage in the same way MPen Mundo does more cleaver damage
* Item’s like Abyssal, provide some utility, and have high MPen so he does a bit more damage

Overall

*****

#**Final Thoughts**

**Sejuani syndrome** - Pretty good at a lot of things

*  Doesn’t have the late game damage of a Hecarim
*  Doesn’t quite have the level 2-3 ganks of a Maokai
*  Doesn’t have the invade ability of a Lee Sin
*  Doesn’t have the counterjungling ability of a Mundo
*  Cannot dive and kill the carry as well as a Xin Zhao
*  Doesn’t have the cc quality or drag/baron/buff control of a Cho
*  Nasus and Amumu are also strong tanks with % max hp magic damage so he’s not unique in that
*  Ult isn’t quite as good at initiating team fights as an Amumu
*  Support/low damage jungle tanks are not too popular right now
*  Numbers still being tweaked and buffed so we’ll have to wait and see how he ends up to say how viable he will be.  While he's not the best at any one thing

**He’s Fun**

* Morello called him a ""throwback to the first 40 champions""
likely meaning the more playful
* He’s not a ""super-cereal"" Darius, etc.
* Blob catching mini-game
* Very cool and flavorful champion
* I feel like I'm playing a character from a [Pixar movie](http://youtu.be/xcDD22R6Lck?t=1m11s)

**Has a lot of potential if the numbers are right**

* Good CC
* Early gank options
* Team fight initiating ult
* Manaless - can freely give blue buff to mid at little cost

*****

#**TLDR**

**May not be top tier competitive at the moment.  We'll have to wait and see how his numbers turn out before hitting live.  He has pretty good gank potential early on, but master of none.**

###I. Introduction

""Inexperience"" is a common word used to explain why a team loses an early lead. However

Obviously, so inexperienced teams typically lack a full understanding of certain concepts that are important for victory. It is rare that people look deeper, into those underlying concepts, which causes the ""inexperienced"" label to exist as a nebulous idea, used primarily as a convenient buzz word and lacking any useful analytical meaning. However, inexperience can be a useful concept and, semantics aside

In the W9D1 game of the NA LCS, but could not close out the game. Their poor understanding of more sophisticated concepts led to numerous mistakes and missed opportunities, typical of inexperienced teams. In this analysis, we will study the portion of the game in which COL began to falter, from [20:40] to [38:35], and examine the mistakes ""caused"" by their inexperience.

We begin in section II by discussing the main concept that COL failed to capitalize on

**Team Comps**

**COL:** **Jayce** (Nickwu), **Varus** (brunch U), **Kayle** (M eye A)

**CRS:** **Kha'zix** (Voyboy), **Twitch** (Cop), **Thresh** (Elementz)

For pushing, with Jayce, Janna, and Varus, but CRS is not weak either, with Kha'zix and Morgana. Furthermore, CRS have Thresh hook plus the threat of Volibear's initiation
___
___
###II. Key Focus: Creep Wave Manipulation

Creep waves have a subtle but extremely impactful effect on the game. A single minion is weak, such as denying the enemy of gold and experience or gaining map control. For our purposes, we will look at a how teams can use creep wave manipulation to execute the slow push strategy (credits for the terminology go to /u/bummer2000).

**The Problem**

Even when a team is winning, the defending team always has the terrain advantage; the turret, the distance to the fountain, and a number of other factors create advantages for the defending team, so while a team may be winning, they cannot always purely push. In order to regain the situational advantage, the team can attempt a slow push.

**The Slow Push**

The slow push is a strategy that uses snowballing creep waves to apply pressure to all 3 lanes

To execute the slow push, so the enemy cannot interfere. Teams should choose an outer lane, allowing more waves to add to the snowball. 

Next, a team can control the rate of the snowball, giving a team as much or little time as it needs to prepare for the next step. 

Finally, the team can play passively, taking no risks while the snowballing lane is pushing in. Once the snowballing lane has reached the enemy turrets, strong pressure from every lane creates a huge advantage for the pushing team.

Clearly, but not enough to siege a tower in a direct push, which is precisely the situation that COL was in.

For an alternate explanation of the slow push

The images in the link below are the crux of this analysis and the reason why I am willing to title the post ""In-Depth"". The next 4 sections are primarily to summarize and to structure the analysis from the chronological format in the images into a categorical format.

All times that I refer to in the next sections are from the image timeline. I have also separated the images into different events (though they are not really separate events outside the context of this analysis) and labeled the events according to the category they belong to.

###IV. Pushing

**Relevant Events:** 1, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12

COL failed in pushing on several levels. Not only did COL fail to recognize opportunities to initiate a slow push (Events 1 2 3 5), turning time against COL and allowing CRS to simply focus on one lane. Lastly, they failed to use creep wave pressure to push when CRS was out of position (Event 12).

Instead, but checking a red buff they weren't sure was there [22:31] or clearing out a single baron ward [21:53] were even worse. On the other hand, when taking the objectives, COL moved to them quickly and timed them well.

These are traits very illustrative of teams with the ""inexperienced"" label in the LCS. Slow pushing and other creep wave manipulation tactics require much more foresight and inference than timing and taking objectives. With less experience, but they see objective opportunities clearly and focus on them.

On the other hand, recognized when creep wave pressure gave them the advantage (Events 4 11). Twice, COL pushed mid while the outer lanes were pushing against them. When they were forced back to defend, CRS recognized they had a window of map control, and immediately pushed forward. Even when CRS failed to recognize creep wave pressure and left themselves open [30:46][34:24], they at least recognized the pressure eventually, unlike COL. Though they still would have been at a disadvantage if COL capitalized
___
___
###V. Tower Sieging

**Relevant Events:** 10

(Tower sieging is technically part of pushing

The 2 times COL made their most concerted pushes into towers, which COL wasn't, they use their own minion waves to tank turret shots in order to damage the turret. These turret shots are essentially a unit of time; the number of turret shots the minion wave tanks is the window of time a team can attack a tower.

In mid lane, but not the caster minions. This means that the ranged minions do not tank tower shots, and thus, the time window to siege is smaller. More minions also provide better blocking against skill shots, crucial for champions like Morgana and Thresh.

However, since her tornado was unlikely to hit when CRS had so much room to run around behind the tower. Again, this is another trait typical of inexperienced teams. The effect of strong poke is much more memorable and obvious, while the advantage from clearing the creep wave is more subtle. Thus, COL chose to poke, failing to fully understand the impact of creep waves. This lack of understanding ultimately caused them to become impatient, attempting to tank a turret and leaving them vulnerable [38:17]. CRS capitalized on this and gained the advantage off the ensuing teamfight.
___
___
###VI. Objective Control

**Relevant Events:** 7

Thanks to their strong map control, there are 2 basic actions a team can take: they can turn to fight or they can continue taking the objective.

However

In COL's situation, forcing a full commitment from CRS in which COL would have the advantage, or netting a baron, if not both. At [28:08], it looked as if they were transitioning to do exactly that. 

But in reality, so they could not catch anyone easily. They were able to catch Thresh, but only at the cost of Varus ult, depriving them of their only long range CC. With only a support down, CRS still had threat and could now poke COL freely and stall for Volibear. This stopped any chance COL had to do baron or take a real advantage off kills.

Taking these more basic actions is again very common for inexperienced teams. Inexperienced teams lack the situational knowledge of what to do, the more basic actions are less risky. But of course, they are also less versatile, causing missed opportunities, as they did with COL.
___
___
###VII. Teamfighting

**Relevant Events:** 6

There are numerous things to talk about with teamfighting, leaving them more susceptible to AOE, forcing them to lose their tank line, or any number of other problems associated with poor positioning. Thus, choke points are terrain features teams should look to force their enemies into and avoid themselves.

In the first teamfight, CRS strayed very little past the wraith brush because they were wary of the choke point. They required a strong advantage to overcome the choke, and since many of their spells had been used, they did not have it, despite the fact that COL was so low. Only when Janna poorly positioned into the area did CRS gain enough advantage to move forward.

In the second teamfight

Failing to consider map terrain is common among even experienced teams
___
___
###VIII. Final Thoughts

After CRS regained the advantage, I encourage you to watch the rest of the game and examine how CRS pressured and pushed the map differently, and the resulting effects. It is also a worthwhile exercise to watch the COL games from W10D1 and look at where some of these mistakes popped up, even when they won.",,False,,1366386055.0,t3_1cm73q

**So

After a LOT of experimentation with various openings (flask+pots, dorans..), I came to LOVE the doran’s blade opening. I felt the extra health gave you so much of an advantage if you ever decided to fight bottom lane. I also felt the sustain on autos was actually very good, and would basically guarantee you win the lane if you ever got an advantage over someone that didn’t run a blade start.

However

However

* 50 gold
* A Biscuit (regenerates 80hp/50mana)
* 2gp10

The 2gp10 is nice but negligible. The real reason for this mastery page lies in being able to get a biscuit AND an extra pot at the start at the game. Now you can effectively start doran’s blade + hp pot + biscuit.

**Why is this start so good?**

The power in this strat lies in the fact that you get a huge amount of health at early levels, healthier, and able to pressure more since you’ll be able to outdamage and outsustain the other adc.

**Blade+Biscuit+Pot VS Other Common Starts** 

Long Sword + Pots: This one is pretty simple; the long sword gives the same amount of ad as the doran’s blade, but very easy for the blade user to all in the sword user. Since the blade user is stronger and has the advantage, he can ALWAYS be full health by simply sustaining on autos from last hitting and harassing.

Doran’s Blade + No Pots: I think this one is fairly obvious. Both blade users are equal in terms of hp and damage

Boots + Pots: In some matchups a boot start may make a large difference, meaning it’s very very easy to gain an advantage and all in the boot user in the first couple levels. 

**Wait

This was the reason I was VERY hesitant to even try to run this build in the first place. After trying it out a few games though

The EXACT stats you lose are:

* Increases damage by 2%
* +5% Crit Damage
* 10% AS for 2 seconds after landing a crit
* 5 armor pen
* Increases damage by 5% to targets below 50%

I’m going to disregard the crit bonuses since at that point in the game

You can also try it yourself, I’m convinced that the change has little to no impact on your dps as the game progresses.

What I’m interested in is how it’ll affect my early game damage. The 2% increase in damage is.. very very negligible early game. Over time it’ll add up slowly, and the enemy will also never have it since you generally won’t be below half hp in lane starting with dorans + hp pot + biscuit.

All of these passives added together do give a slightly noticable change in dps

______________________________________________________________________________________________
**I. Introduction**

The 2v1 lane swap has dominated the early game in the NA LCS. However, CLG vs CRS, CLG showed why that was the case, leveraging the blue side 2v1 lane to an easy dragon. It was an excellent play, using the bottom side map control to gain an easy, riskless lead. Let's take a look at what they did.

**Team Comps**

**CLG:** **Cho'gath** (HotshotGG), **Vayne** (Doublelift), **Lulu** (Aphromoo)

**CRS:** **Tryndamere** (Voyboy), **Miss Fortune** (Cop), **Alistar** (Elementz)
______________________________________________________________________________________________
**II. Timeline Summary &amp; Analysis**

**[--&gt;Timeline Summary &amp; Analysis&lt;--](http://imgur.com/a/NDw5g#0)**


______________________________________________________________________________________________
**III. Key Idea: Early Game Information**

What makes CLG's play great is the excellent use of early game information and inference to mitigate any risk. They did not make any move without knowing it was safe. CLG was able to snowball their early game information into actions that created both advantages and opportunities for more information. With good foresight

* 

**Information from the Pre-Game**

From [0:52], nor the reasoning behind whatever their plan was. It's possible they were confident in their level 1 or they knew from previous scrims that CRS was likely to set up such that there were less than 4 near blue. Alternatively, perhaps it was a potential plan, but only if CLG obtained more information. Looking at the 4v4 level 1 comps, CLG does seem to have a slight lead with Lux bind and Lulu's slow. If the tops would join in--and both had teleport--Cho'gath would also prove more useful.

It is also a possibility that CLG already had the dragon play in mind as well, it's hard to say. Tryndamere is very weak early game and has no wave clear or harass. This means he would be easy to bully and push upon with a 3v1. On the other hand, Cho'gath has good wave clear for a top lane, which would delay a counter 3v1 to an extent. Also, CLG had a decent comp to do an early dragon, with 2 shields and vayne's true damage. As we will see later, these actually become factors in the dragon play, if not from the very beginning.

**Summary:** It's hard to say for sure

* 

**Information from the Opening**

CLG's opening was very well thought out and synergized well with a potential blue invade. By fanning out and warding the way they did

Unlike before, and most likely inferred exactly how CRS would start based off the vision. But they did not leave it up to their inference. Instead, knowing CRS was in the red jungle, CLG knew Lux could safely ward the mid lane blue entrance [1:22]. From there, seeing only Kayle pass through, they could definitely tell Tryndamere and Kayle were taking wolves. Thus, they could safely invade blue with absolutely no risk and potentially kill Tryndamere if he hadn't warded, but how CLG used the information information to gain more information and make the blue steal a completely riskless play. 

**Summary:** CLG saw CRS and played off of the information perfectly to execute a completely riskless blue steal.

* 

**Information from the Blue Steal**

Knowing they would invade blue, CRS was forced to pull their top duo to secure the blue, which meant Cho'gath could trim the wave, so the top wave was smaller than the bot wave. By synthesizing this information, CLG knew they could go for a much faster tower push, with high potential for a followup dragon. By tower pushing, CLG knew CRS would almost certainly try a 3v1 push as well, which then set CLG up for an easy dragon. To this end

**Summary:** By using inference and information well

* 

**Information from the Tower Push**

At this point

**Summary:** CLG looked at the situation after the tower and made the easy dragon call.

* 

**Conclusion**

As you can see, CLG ensured they had the information to make a decision to stop and play standard as well, so the play was completely riskless. This is the true beauty of the play. For example, the events would have been exactly the same if CLG proceeded with the blue steal without Lux warding at [1:22], but CLG could not have known, which meant it was a much riskier play. CLG made extra precautions and ensured their play was risk-free.
______________________________________________________________________________________________
**IV. Counterplay**

After CRS showed themselves at [1:08], but the death did not have any real effect on the dragon play. Overall, unless CRS has psychic powers or had seen this strategy before, there aren't many errors to point out. However, there definitely are things CRS could have done to prevent the dragon play. To properly discuss counterplay would take far too much space, so instead, let's take a very brief look at how CLG handled the situation. Indeed, in the W4D3 COL vs CLG game. Briefly

* **Send the AD/Support Bot** - It's hard to say if CLG did this in precaution to this strat or for some other reason. They did have a squishy 3 man dive against Jayce who is mobile and has nice long range wave clear, the ad/support bot obviously greatly lessens the ability to tower push and have lower map control to take dragon. With a wards at both blue entrances, CLG was able to take wolves safely while COL invaded, actually coming out ahead of their counterparts. However, since they were forced to run the long way to lane, the bot lanes leveled to 2 at the same time (literally within a second apart).  Chauster just countered the blue, coming out a bit ahead as he got golems as well. It could be interesting to see if the dragon advantage is exploited more and the 2v2 bot lane becomes more popular again.

* **Avoid Wards** - CLG, everyone on CLG except Link did not show later on, so COL had less idea of where they were. Chauster and Hotshot moved to do golems to avoid being seen. Most likely, CLG made the move primarily to avoid any aggression on Chauster rather than any mind games about blue, but it is still important not to give out early game positioning information in most situations. If a team has a weker level 1 and has seen no one on the map, they will be less likely to invade.

______________________________________________________________________________________________
**V. Final Thoughts**

This early game play is not only interesting because of the great foresight and execution by CLG, the 2v2 bot lane that was dominant in the past was primarily to ensure dragon control. Can this strategy be generalized to a point where it forces the 2v2 to become the norm again? There are a lot of interesting topics to think about regarding the pre-laning phase, the first 2 or so minutes of the game. In many ways, it the most standard part of the game, with both teams beginning with equal knowledge and on equal footing. However, it is also one of the most variable phases of the game, with such little vision for both sides. In the future,,False,t3_19q1sv

###I. Introduction

The very beginning of each game of League of Legends presents an interesting dichotomy. On one hand, each team, through no action of their own, is intimately aware of the other's positioning. The teams have an accurate idea of each other's gold counts, and from this, a solid grasp on the potential itemization routes. They have the same map control and map vision. Each team knows these things, and knows that the other team knows.

Yet, the standardization and the volatility, present in the same way for competitive play. 

This unique beginning phase of each game, and attempt to explain the pre-laning meta based off the theoretical framework created in these posts. 

Part 1 will act as an introductory post to present the basic concepts that will be necessary in our exploration of the pre-laning phase. We begin by defining the pre-laning phase and its main ideas in section II. We then examine unique characteristics of the pre-laning phase is sections III and IV. We end with a brief overview of openings in section V
___
###II. The Pre-Laning Phase

**The pre-laning phase** is the first phase of the game, when the laning phase begins. In other words, it ends when focus has shifted away from opening objectives, primarily red and blue buff, and towards farming minions. This can occur as early as [1:55], but there is no upper limit to when the pre-laning phase must end. In most games, it occurs shortly after [2:00], as CS offers greater and less volatile gains. Realistically

**Objectives**

As mentioned in the introduction, with the right use of game knowledge. Yet with a lack of map vision, teams are still extremely lacking in information. This means that gaining information in this phase of the game is all the more important. 

Strategies in the pre-laning phase, using the inferable information they have at the start of the game to create new opportunities for information. They try to gain as much useful information as possible, while, at the same time, concealing as much as possible from the enemy.

Primarily, is invaluable for determining their strategy. This is especially true in cases of clear aggression, but even the smallest bit of vision can go a long way toward gaining an early game advantage, whether through countering an enemy's opening or preparing against jungle/lane setups. 

Below we will overview the distinctive features of the pre-laning phase
___
###III. Itemization

Unique to the pre-laning phase, based on the Wealth mastery: 475, 500, and 525. Starting itemization is primarily focused toward the laning phase, so any conclusions about enemy openings based on itemization are questionable. However, understanding itemization can still be useful in the pre-laning phase. 

We will not delve deeply into the reasoning behind the items, but that requires the player to be spotted, and the player will have to either recall again at a riskier time or go to lane with fewer items. As it is, current top teams always fully use their starting gold.

In most cases

1. Gain vision of an enemy
2. Infer the starting item build
3. Count the wards in the current inventory
4. Determine how many wards have been placed

Along with other factors

**Fig. 1: [Typical Starting Items and Builds](http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1b9649/competitive_lol_theory_an_introduction_to_the/c94wzps)**

**Example 1**

Elise passes over a ward with a sight ward and 9 potions in her inventory. The enemy team can then conclude with high probability that she dropped a ward.

**Example 2**

Sona is first spotted with a vision ward, teams are unlikely to use a pink ward unless they know they will kill a ward or are invading heavily. Teams are even less likely to use 2 pinks without knowing where enemy wards are, even in invades. Thus, there is a high likelihood Sona dropped 3 sight wards. 


___
###IV. Map Analysis

Another unique trait of the pre-laning phase is that the map is clean; throughout the rest of the game, and numerous jungle timers, all add pressure to different points of the map, creating areas of focus for each team. With a clean map, there are no such things. Instead, teams must consider the entire map to prepare for the map-wide jungle spawn times, [1:40] and [1:55]. With a clean map

**Terrain**

*Blue/Red Side Considerations*

At level 1, a relatively neutral ground. Outside of the jungle entrances, there are four additional routes to the river, through lanes. Inside each jungle are the main targets: red/blue buff.

As the first line of defense, invaders have far fewer exits than the defenders and are farther away from their own structures, making invades risky. However, with the 2 buffs, select locations within the jungle are important secondary focal points.

*Top/Bottom Side Considerations*

Mobility is a huge factor throughout the game, locations up the middle of the map have higher priority than those towards the end.

**Fig. 2: [Map Terrain Overview](http://imgur.com/a/p8NVM#0)**

**Timings**

With such little starting map vision, refer to the times needed to move between various points on the map. Understanding timings allows teams to estimate past, present, and future enemy positioning. 

When the game starts, each team knows where the other can potentially be at a certain time, so teams know which areas are unsafe. Timings that start from the base, or **base timings**, are especially noteworthy, since they are applicable in every single game.

If an enemy player is spotted, teams may infer valuable information like openings, ward placements, or jungle/lane setups. Thus, timings play a large role in dictating map movement and warding patterns, as teams attempt to hide as much information from the enemy as possible.

___
###V. Openings

Let's now briefly overview openings

As mentioned above

**Initial &amp; Reactive Stages**

It is often helpful to think of a level 1 strategy in 2 stages. 

The **initial stage** is the first stage of an opening

The **reactive stage** occurs once the team gains useful information and can then reassess their opening and make any necessary reactions to the new information. Ideally

**The 3 Types of Openings**

Generally, and Late Invade strategies.

*Passive*

As the name implies, but only in response to enemy aggression.

**Fig. 4: [Passive Opening Example](http://imgur.com/a/p8NVM#12)**

*Early Invade*

Similarly, as early invades give ample time for the enemy to respond. In rare cases where teams are confident they have not been seen, buff stealing is still a possibility. Early invades are the most diverse type of openings, as teams choose when, where, and how aggressively to invade.

**Fig. 5-7: [3 Early Invade Examples](http://imgur.com/a/p8NVM#13)**

*Late Invade*

**Late invade openings** typically begin with a passive setup to hide information from the enemy. The invade begins just before [1:40] or [1:55], hoping to catch the enemy team unprepared. Teams usually invade blue, as it is a much safer target.

**Fig. 8: [Late Invade Example](http://imgur.com/a/p8NVM#16)**

The opening that a team chooses depends on many factors, and general team preferences.

1371572345.0,1glbia,Detailed Analysis of NA LCS Superweek with Statistics!,spellsy,76,14,16,"In my last article titled “6 Things LCS can Improve on, with EU vs. NA and champion analysis continued in the comments!

**Teams**

Out of all the teams performances in this weeks LCS, Dig, and C9, stood out the most in their performance and statistics. Breaking down things like FB (first blood), objective control, and total kills we get exciting insight into how their actions show their priorities as a team and create unique play styles for each team. Analyzing these statistics actually gave a lot of insight not just into the meta, but also into the teams specifically as we see different play styles and priorities coming from each team. I am going to highlight a few of their picks and play styles that really stood out to me. 

**TSM**

The first interesting team to look at is the “aggressive” TSM. People always hype TSM’s aggressiveness and their playmaker Reginald, coming in at an average of 9:05 (compared to the week’s average of 5:40). They prioritize kills the least and they have even said in interviews that they don’t go after kills unless it will provide objectives. This is clearly seen as they have given up FB 4 out of their 5 games. Despite their games averaging the slowest FBs, they have the fastest objectives in the league. TSM took dragon all 5 games for themselves and averaged at the quickest pace (8 min and 25 seconds, compared to league average of 9:55). They also force slightly faster first towers at the pace of 6:34, compared to the average 6:54. This prioritization of objectives over kills shows in their picks as well as they often choose Shen or jungle Elise. Oddone’s Elise is a priority pick for TSM not just because he hit challenger with it, but because Elise is one of the best early dragon takers due to her spiders acting as the tank which is essential to mitigate the high amount of damage that Dragon does early game. Out of the 4 quickest dragons during the week, TSM got 3 of them - all with Elise jungle. TSM’s objective focused play style can also be seen in their kill/death stats, 2nd lowest is VES at 57) in the league but also the lowest team deaths (45

**Dignitas**

On the other side of the coin, coming in at 4:23 compared to the league average at 5:40. However, at the same time they have by FAR the slowest tower and Dragon times out of any other team, averaging 11:53 Dragon time (vs. league average 9:55), and 8:53 average tower time (vs. league average 6:54). These slow times come from Dig’s tendency to 2v2 over 2v1. In the 20 games of Superweek there were only three 2v2 matchups in NA, every other game was 2v1 mid/top vs 2v1 bot. All three of these 2v2s were forced by Dignitas. Many may attribute this to “slow adoption of the meta” and think that this contributed to Dig’s poor performance this week yet on the contrary in all three of these 2v2 games Dignitas ‘won’ the early game and came out with a gold lead at 10 minutes. Both of Dig’s wins were in these 3 games and the 3rd was the CLG/Dig game which... we all knew what a mess that was. I believe that Dig’s 2v2 abilities will be very important going forward as I believe the 3.8 patch will bring forth more 2v2 style in the NA LCS. 

**\#c9hypetrain**

The last team I am going to look at is the very hyped Cloud 9. Going into this super week I strongly felt that they were going to do well yet their play still surprised me significantly - not just due to the resulting 5-0, but a very poised and flexible team who has great decision making abilities. Cloud 9 does not get the fastest towers or push the most out of any team nor do they get an early advantage every game. They prioritize objectives, but there is nothing exceptional about it. They have average FB timers (5:36), a bit slower than average dragon timer (10:57), a bit faster tower timer (6:20), and they only got out to an early lead 2 out of 5 games. This is what makes Cloud 9 the scariest team in the league. They play like an experienced team despite this being their first week in LCS, they don’t get flustered when behind, only beaten by CLG’s inflated stats due to their long games and thus having more teamfights than the average team).

**Snowballing**

The next big topic is one that comes up a lot in interviews with players: the issue of snowballing. Often times a lane getting first blood is attributed to it’s success, first dragon, first baron, gold advantage at 10 minutes, and gold advantage at 20 minutes. 

* First blood was the most neutral statistic with the winning team scoring first blood in 50% of the games, with the average time being 5 min 40 sec and almost equally in all 3 lanes (6 top, 5 mid, 6 bot, 3 drag). 
* The next statistic, was way more often top and bot than mid (6 top, 3 mid, 11 bot), and was favored to the blue side (13 purple tower deaths, 7 blue deaths).  
* The most bizarre statistic goes to first dragon (average time 9:55), and it often puts the team that initially started dragon into a vulnerable position to be ganked. 
* The last neutral objective statistic - first Baron - leads to the highest win rate as expected, as 1/3rd of the successful barons were gotten by teams who at the time had a gold disadvantage. This is often due to the fact that after winning a teamfight as a losing team you don’t have the map pressure to take towers, and so instead they will take baron to give a few minute buffer to try and make a stronger comeback and deny objectives from the other team. 
* The next snowball factor to look at is gold lead at 10 minutes. This was the most definitive early factor with 64.7% of teams with a gold lead at 10 minutes going on to win the game. Of these advantages, coming in at 14.5k gold vs 11.8k gold with CST winning the game. While many people would think that blue side would tend to lead early game due to the double golem advantages, it turns out purple actually gets out to an early lead more often at a rate of 76.47%! 
* The last factor tracked was the gold advantage at 20 min. This is the biggest predictor of win likeliness

**Bonus Statistic Quick Fires (Stats are from NA Superweek)**

* Average time for an LCS game is 38:20
* If game time had a normal distribution 
* Team Velocity has both the lowest kills per average game of any team (12.4)
* At 10 minutes the gold lead went to the Purple team 76.4% of the time. 
* The Blue team wins 60% of the games. 
* The team with the lead in gold at 10 minutes continues to lead at 20 minutes 76.4% of the time.
* NA picked or banned 47.8% of all champs

I came from competitive DotA2 scene
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ihVc2swLPQ
This is a video about DotA2 zone control

Basically zone control is the most important mechanical skill that everyone playing any role should have

Let's look at some examples:
**Doublelift's vayne performance against MRN** http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7uvXALE3OM
**Wildturtle's draven 2v2 against CLG**
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVbukS8x_4w

As you can see from Doublelift's vayne game

* He hits whatever is in-front of him

* But whenever an enemy with hard cc (off cool down) enters into his zone of engagement

His focus in the fight was this:
Alistar-&gt;used his combo-&gt;Shen-&gt;burned taunt on teammates-&gt;Irelia-&gt;died-&gt;Shen-&gt;died-&gt;diana.

He understands each enemy champion's cool downs and potential zone of engagements, and that hard cc's counter kiting, therefore he must remove all the threats that stop him from getting the maximum effectiveness out of his champion.

Now let's look at Wildturtle's draven play. Partly due to Xpecial's great thresh play as well.

* They first get engaged on by leona

* Most people would run from that situation

* This means that leona has entered 3 enemy zones: Draven

* Wildturtle also notices that ezreal is focusing thresh

* Though CLG has the health advantage

* Now doublelift arcane shifts into draven's zone of engagement

After analyzing those two amazing adc players
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94xfOX6aQAQ

* He stands very far behind blitz

* Varus gets away with his barrier and one auto left

* He cannot be engaged by thresh hook

* Thresh has already used flay to disengage from blitzcrank.

* Leesin and kayle were both just exiting tribush

* Caitlyn had barrier up within 2 seconds after engagement and flash.

Cop did the typical low level adc thing, but does not get off any damage.

What an adc has to do is take the most damage and deal the most damage, but dealt damage throughout the fight without running too far away.

Cop does not understand zone control and zones of engagement, you have to be in the fight to deal damage and that means sometimes your safe zone will be threatened, but knowing how to deal with that is what separates good adcs and bad adcs.

TL;DR Learn some zone control...everybody.

______________________________________________________________________________________________
**I. Introduction**

Teamfighting is one of the most important, as it did for the W3D1 game: CLG vs DIG. Public opinions of CLG and DIG are polar opposites after W3, but those opinions were fueled by wins and losses. Few attempted to look further, into the actual gameplay, to substantiate their opinion. To that end, let's take an in depth look at the teamfights of the CLG vs DIG game to see what we can glean about the two teams' abilities.

**Team Comps**

**CLG:** **Galio** (HotshotGG), **Kog'Maw** (Doublelift), **Alistar** (Aphromoo)

**DIG:** **Singed** (KiwiKid), **Draven** (Imaqtpie), **Zyra** (Patoy)

The teamfighting potential for each comp is similar enough. DIG is stronger in a pure theoretic 5v5 engage, the teamfights were not decided by the picks. 
______________________________________________________________________________________________
**II. Teamfight 1: [19:30-20:03]**

**[Teamfight Description &amp; Analysis](http://imgur.com/a/DFJXg/layout/horizontal#0)**

**Main Ideas:**

Vi's initiation onto CLG was bad on 3 levels. As the champion furthest out in front, the rest of the team's positioning behind the turret created an obstacle that slowed them and forced them to group up if they were to get to the target, Kog, as fast as possible (which they had to do given how deep Vi had gone). Lastly, Kog was not particularly out of position or behind his teammates, which allowed the members to easily prepare to zone/peel. Because of these factors, CLG won the instant Vi initiated. 

To their credit, Kog's mistake, dying to tower, stopped CLG's chances to take real advantage of the situation, which may have cost them the chance to snowball to an easy victory.

**In Brief: DIG initiated poorly; CLG peeled and zoned properly; Both Kog and Draven died for no reason; 3-2 CLG**
______________________________________________________________________________________________
**III. Teamfight 2: [22:19-22:43]**

**[Teamfight Description &amp; Analysis](http://imgur.com/a/wqaqT#0)**

**Main Ideas:**

Once again, this initiation differs from the previous one in several respects. First, the tower is in the center of the lane, and most of DIG is well spread out, so it doesn't act as an obstacle. Second, Vi is not forced to use her vault breaker in conjunction to her ult, giving her an easy escape. Third, and most importantly

Even with all this, it's very possible CLG would have won another easy teamfight. However, the entire tank line completely ignores Kog and runs to the DIG carries instead, leaving huge holes for DIG to exploit. In addition, despite lacking a tank line, the DIG carries are safe because they have a turret behind them, and are primarily attacked by tanks. Kayle and Zyra do a good job switching the CLG's aggro. Meanwhile, allowing him to safely dish out autoattacks. Along with the tower

CLG should have approached this fight in a similar manner to the previous one, ignoring their own carries, falling out of position, and failing to account for the off-cooldown CC and skills of DIG. Galio, in particular, failed to account for the enemy CC and has his ult canceled immediately. Ahri wasted her CC twice, which she could have used to peel the tanks off of Kog both times. 

**In Brief: DIG initiated questionably; CLG failed to peel for Kog and focused too hard on DIG carries; 2-0 DIG**

**IV. Teamfight 3: [26:35-27:33]**

**[Teamfight Description &amp; Analysis](http://imgur.com/a/FweS1#0)**

**Main Ideas:**

Both teams fail to account for and take advantage of the choke point. From the start, with their tanks split from their carries thanks to the choke point, but CLG fails to capitalize. Like the last fight, Galio zeros in too hard on ulting when he should be taking the time to assess the situation and the skills of the enemy team. With flash up, he has the luxury of sitting back and waiting for the perfect moment. Instead, he overextends past the choke, making it very difficult for his team to follow up, wasting her CC another two times

CLG should have slowly kited the tanks once DIG was out of position, but CLG definitely would have won. Overall, this is less than ideal play from both teams. 

**In Brief: DIG positioned poorly with respect to the choke point; CLG failed to capitalize as Galio flashed and ulted out of position; 5-2 DIG**
______________________________________________________________________________________________
**V. Teamfight 4: [30:20-31:14]**

**[Teamfight Description &amp; Analysis](http://imgur.com/a/dTl4T#0)**

**Main Ideas:**

This teamfight is a huge series of mistakes:

Kog chooses to farm bot, and none of his team was in position. Singed then chases CLG for no reason and gets caught. DIG blindly runs into an unwarded brush they know CLG is in, leading the charge with Zyra. Ahri does a good job to burst her, but then chooses to waste a dash getting close to Draven, despite having just used her burst. Vi then makes the mistake of ulting Ahri even when there is still one dash left. The other members of DIG then group up into a choke trying to help Vi. However, Alistar uses his combo too early as Kog's focus was just on Vi, failing to remember Kayle's ult for the second fight in a row. This is a very sloppy teamfight by both sides. 

**In Brief: Both teams made a slew of poor mistakes that teams with their experience shouldn't be making; 5-2 DIG**
______________________________________________________________________________________________
**VI. Key Points**

***CLG***

* **Protect the Carries** - Twice, and in the other, they left him alone. Unsurprisingly, CLG won the first fight and lost the second. It is odd that CLG would play so well one time, and then fail the next. There were some differences, such as the distance between them and the tower, that may have made CLG overaggressive in the second fight. However, so the reaction should have been the same. In the situation of a deep dive initiation

* **Use Abilities Wisely** - Unfortunately, a goal in which he succeeded each time. However, he failed to pay attention to the situation and the abilities of DIG. Outside of the first fight, he either ulted in bad position, was immediately interrupted, or both. Galio ult is a gamechanging ability and a huge part of Galio's kit. Being aware of the situation is necessary for all heroes and skills, but it is especially important for Galio's ult. Hotshot needs to be less hasty and focus not only on landing his abilities on many people, he cast it just because it was up, opportunities arose later to use charm to great effect

* **Track Enemy Cooldowns** - By failing to keep track of the enemy abilities, turning CLG's aggressiveness into poor positioning and easy cleanup. Kayle ult was the most important ult on DIG's team, and it is imperative to keep track of such skills. Failing tp account for the skill first time was not good, but failing a second time soon after is unacceptable. Keeping track of such skills individually is hard, so CLG must strengthen their team communication during teamfights and keep track of skills together.

***DIG***

* **Initiate Smartly** - Vi initiated twice, but CLG did not play ideally. It's very plausible the second initiation would have ended with a loss as well, had CLG properly peeled. Either way, DIG must be cognizant of the team's overall positioning. Diving so far ahead as an initiator makes any follow up impossible. It simply gives the enemy team an easy target. Though Vi has great initiation, Crumbzz still needs to be smart when going in.

***GENERAL***

* **Account for Map Terrain** - Both teams fail to make note of the different map structures at times. The third teamfight is the best example, can be huge, as it forced DIG to group up for an easy Alistar stun. Turrets behind DIG in the second fight created a safe zone to fall back to. CLG should have been deterred from trying to move forward, but failed to account for this. In general, I feel this is an area of competitive play all top teams recognize to an extent, but have not seriously emphasized directly. As a result, most teams have a subconcious feel for map terrain

______________________________________________________________________________________________
**VII. Final Thoughts**

The only teamfight in which a team truly played well was CLG in the first teamfight (minus the Kog death). DIG often made the first mistake, poor spell usage, and plenty of dumb mistakes. Still, despite all the mistakes, it wasn't bad either. In absolute terms, both teams played poorly. However, even the best teams today are nowhere close to perfect. Judging by today's standards, or even above average. But,,1362085270.0
1362507968.0,19pxnx,I hate Riot's current balance philosophy.,YamiSilaas,82,28,40,"First I want to preface this by saying I love Riot. I think they do fantastic work and I appreciate all the effort they put into making league what it is.

With that said their design choices when it comes to item and champion balance lately have seemed somewhat short sighted and missguided.

First there was the overwhelming popularity of black cleaver. Early this season it was bought on everyone, leading to the discovery of Warmogs. 

With Warmogs now being rushed by everyone and used as the sole defensive item for nearly every champion Riot decided the problem was that warmogs was overpowered, So be prepared to deal with a lot of Vlads, Eves and Rumbles. 

I do agree that these items have caused a problem

This is a MOBA. Games like these have always been finding out what's the strongest, etc etc. It creates a healthy game environment by having a constantly shifting metagame. It keeps the players on their toes. 

However Riot seems to have adopted a policy for popular items and champions that's more about the communities over-reactions rather than actual game balance

In situations where something is blatantly overpowered i understand nerfing it however when you do what you did to Rengar and completely kill the champions viability in the competitive scene all you're doing is wasting the time and effort of the players.

I just feel Riot's not letting the game evolve by itself and are only listening to the community.

That's my opinion anyway

TL;DR: Riot's recent balance changes seem to be massive knee-jerk nerfs in response to the communities massive knee-jerk over-reactions. ",,t5_2wenn,False,,SejuaniPig,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/19pxnx/i_hate_riots_current_balance_philosophy/

The other day I put up a survey looking to learn which LCS teams you all support and a bit about where you all come from. Well the results have come in and I’ve collected the information into a few graphs and maps.

 

**[Which NA LCS teams have the most fans?](http://i.imgur.com/oCdUUy6.png)**

-**TSM and CLG were the favorite teams** for over half of respondents with TSM having the edge by 6%

-**Curse was in third** place and it was actually **Cloud 9 in fourth**. Their excellent performance this split has won them more fans than the more established Dig

  


**[Where can LCS fans be found?] (http://i.imgur.com/WNQzzwW.png)**

-**California** has by far the largest cluster of respondents followed by **New York** and **Texas**. 

-While this simply matches up with the more densely populated states in the US

-There seems to be a concentration of fans around the **Great Lakes**.

 

 
**[What team is each state cheering for?](http://i.imgur.com/KBigxCd.png)**

-As the team with the biggest fan-base overall, and Texas.

-**CLG** and **Curse** also win out in a few states and even **Cloud 9**

  


**[What other teams do fans like?](http://i.imgur.com/T4LorTN.png)**

-This is the most interesting to me. First we look at which team each responder says they MOST support. Then we look at which other teams they say they are fans of. We can see some interesting relationships between fan-bases.

-**Cloud 9 and Velocity fans also like TSM** which may be explained by the friendly relationship between the teams (for Cloud 9) or by the OddBros (Velocity)

-**Curse fans like CLG** next most, and Voyboy / IWillDominate for Dig.



 
**Some caveats and assumptions**

-This is a quick and dirty analysis; the data reflects “r/lol &amp; r/summoners users who happened to click glaiveguy’s survey” and I don’t claim this to be a 100% accurate representation of the LCS fanbase.

-As you can see I am missing data for many states. I chose not to display results for states with fewer than 10 people represented (and even that few is lower than I’d typically go). In the future I’ll leave the survey up longer and hopefully garner more respondents.

-For those who feel reliable data shouldn’t get in the way of a neat visual

-As many pointed out this is only showing the United States at the moment. This was my first time collecting data on LoL so I kept it smaller scale to see how things went. **I will run a follow-up survey before World Championships collecting data across all LoL playing regions.**

-I have data for the EU LCS teams as well and will post that as a follow-up in the coming days.

So his talk jumped back and forth between examples from LoL and WoW.  But the jist of the message focused on teamplay and competitive mechanics where player agency was at the forefront.  Skills which do not promote interaction from teammates or the other team are not good skills.

For example, he talked about Garen's regeneration passive as a good example of a passive that allow for counter play (keeping poke on him to stop his passive from activating).  He also pointed to Twisted Fate's +gold passive as a dull teamplay skill.

He went deep on a comparison of Ryze and Morgana's stuns.   He discussed how they were balanced for range and cooldown, leading, etc.  It was very focused on the psychology of the players and how their reactions made the game better.  A Morgana who lands a stun feels more of a sense of accomplishment, likewise the enemy who manages to dodge it. 

He presented Caitlyn's ultimate as a great example of a skill which promotes teamplay because it could lead to ""heroic"" play.  I totally agree with that

He then spent a few minutes on Thresh's lantern
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWacjXfNsRU

He was very excited about Thresh's lantern as an example of a skill which promotes good teamplay.  I came away with the impression that this is the kind of skill they're looking to do more and more in the future.  In the Q&amp;A someone asked if this increase in skillshot based abilities wouldn't make the game harder -- Caldwell said he wasn't concerned.

At one point in the talk he said they felt LoL has a real issue with clarity in team fights.  He said it was often very hard to assess threats and showed a screenshot of a big messy teamfight.   Unfortunately, Riot.

1371831977.0,1gsvtg,Determining approximate jungler gold based off CS.,frdrk,54,7,12,"READ THIS: THIS IS CURRENTLY AN UNFINISHED WORK IN PROGRESS

Determining jungler money from CS

**Introduction:**

A judgment I'm finding difficult to make in my games is the amount of farm my jungler has - junglers in general get lower CS than laners but how much is their average CS worth compared to an average CS of a laner? As such



*The questions I want to ask are the following:*

* Approximately how much is one jungle CS worth compared to one lane CS?
* Is this different if the jungler is doing only wraiths/wolves compared to wraiths/wolves/golems? (This question due to the tendency to ignore golems as a jungler.)

*Assumptions and limitations on my study:*

* I am assuming jungler farm comes 100% from the jungle

* I am disregarding the money gained from buff monsters

* I am assuming game lengths of 21 minutes/55 seconds and 41 minutes/55 seconds for two estimations

**Data used for my calculations:**

* Melee minion gold value: **20 gold** - increasing by **~0
* Caster minion gold value: **15 gold** - increasing by **~0
* Siege minion gold value: **40 gold** - increasing by **~0

*= *Approximations based on gold increasing every 3 minutes to make an average for minutewise growth


* Wolf camp gold value: **55 gold plus 2x4 gold**. - increasing by (**0
* Wraith camp gold value: **30 gold plus 3x3 gold**. - increasing by (**0
* Golem camp gold value: 55 gold plus 15 gold. - increasing by (**0

Based on the above, and that was high school level math. (*Folkeskolematematik in Denmark where I'm from*):



To do this

**Percentage of minion types of CS

We know that:

* Every 30 seconds a wave of 3 melee minions and 3 caster minions will spawn.

* Every third wave

This makes three minion waves include the following minions:

* 9 Melee minions

* 9 Caster minions

* 1 Siege minion

Giving us 19 minions total, **47,4%** of the minions being Ranged and **5,3%** of the minions being Siege.

This means that I assume that for every 100 CS of a laner

**Percentage of minion types of CS

The approach here is a little different than the laning approach

I will make estimates based on two approaches: One doing wraiths/wolves and one doing all three types of small camps.

**Wraiths/Wolves clearing only:**

The jungler CS will consist of camps with the following contents:

* 1 Big Wraith

* 3 Small Wraiths

* 1 Giant Wolf

* 2 Small Wolves

This gives us percentages of the junglers CS as follows:

* 14

* 42

* 14

* 28

(Total: 99

This means that I assume that for every 100 CS of a jungler doing the Wraith/Wolves farming only, 42,3 Small Wraiths, 14,3 Giant Wolves and 28,6 Small Wolves.*

**Clearing all types of camps:**

The jungler CS will consist of camps with the following contents:

* 1 Big Golem

* 1 Small Golem

* 1 Big Wraith

* 3 Small Wraiths

* 1 Giant Wolf

* 2 Small Wolves

This gives us percentages of the junglers CS as follows:

* 11

* 11

* 11

* 33

* 11

* 22

(Total: ~99

This means that I assume that for every 100 CS of a jungler doing the Wraith/Wolves farming only, 11,1 Small Golems, 11,1 Big Wraiths, 33,3 Small Wraiths,1 Giant Wolves and 22



**Calculations

For the 20 minute game

**Average gold value of monsters and minions:**

**Monsters**

* Big Golem average gold value - Base: 55 gold,8gold x 20 minutes = 8 gold) = **63 gold.**
* Small Golem average gold value - Base: 15gold,23gold x 20 minutes = 2,3 gold) = **17,3 gold.**
* Big Wraith average gold value - Base: 30gold,72gold x 20 minutes = 7,2 gold) = **37,2 gold.**
* Small Wraith average gold value - Base: 3 gold,054gold x 20 minutes = 0,54 gold) = **3,54 gold.**
* Giant Wolf average gold value - Base: 55 gold,65gold x 20 minutes = 6,5 gold) = **61,5 gold.**
* Small Wolf average gold value - Base: 4 gold,081gold x 20 minutes = 0,81 gold) = **4,81 gold.**

**Minions**

* Melee minion average gold value - Base: 20 gold,1666gold x 20 minutes = 1,6666 gold) = **21,6666 gold.**
* Caster minion average gold value - Base: 15 gold,1666gold x 20 minutes = 1,6666 gold) = **16,6666 gold.**
* Siege minion average gold value - Base: 40 gold,3333gold x 20 minutes = 3,3333 gold) = **43,3333 gold.**

**Gold distribution per 100 CS**

**Junglers:**

*Non golems:*

* Big Wraiths: 14,96 gold
* Small Wraiths: 42,742
* Giant Wolves: 14,45
* Small Wolves: 28,566

Total value of 100 CS for a non golem jungler: 1698

*All camps:*

* Big Golems:11
* Small Golems: 11,03 gold
* Big Wraiths: 11,92 gold
* Small Wraiths: 33,882 gold
* Giant Wolves: 11,65 gold
* Small Wolves: 22,782 gold

Total value of 100 CS for a golem jungler: 2211

**Laners:**

* Melee minions: 47,99684 gold
* Small Wraiths: 47,99684 gold
* Giant Wolves: 5,66649 gold

Total value of 100 CS for a laner: 2046

**Conclusion:**

The average gold value per CS in a 21 minute 55 seconds game for the various players look like this:

* The nongolem jungler: 16
* The golem jungler: 22
* The laner: 20

The junglers CS value compared to the laner is 83% and 108% respectively. Practically, and the jungler not doing golems will have to farm **120,4 CS** to break even with the laner.

This indicates the importance of doing golems for a jungler in terms of farming and gives you an approximate metric of measuring if you have ""good farm"" as a jungler. Considering also that the numbers are so close to even added with the observation that most junglers average 40-50% of the CS of a good laner in most games

To round it all up, but my knowledge of high level math is limited.

1373155459.0,1hrxv5,2 Solo 1 Duo: The rise of generic solo laners in competitive play (analysis article),PraiseLoL,51,7,7,"Until recently in League of Legends, this identity has become less fixed, top and middle laners are now subjected to 1v2s

First and foremost, in order to fit what they hope to achieve with their strategy. An example of this would be to send Caitlyn &amp; Fiddlesticks middle, with the intention to fast-push the turret against a team with weak wave clear. A laner with superior dragon control, or team fight potential such as Orianna may then be placed bottom, with a split-pusher or duelist such as Zed being placed in the top lane. Looking at this structure, not much is different from the traditional lane setup; bottom simply swaps with the middle laner. However, it is not the result, that is significant, but in order to implement a strategy.

So why is this lane setup superior to the traditional setup?  Simply put, mid v mid, etc). This means that if someone was counter-picked, or simply less skilled than their opponent, they were forced into an unfavourable matchup, usually relying on jungle pressure (which took pressure off the rest of the map). Interestingly, this was why the final pick was valued so highly for the top lane in North America for much of Season 2, and the pressure drawn from having a winning matchup.

In the current meta, whereas the traditional lane matchups are not important. This is one of the main advantages of running 2 solos and 1 duo: you can pick for your team composition and generally not be forced into bad matchups, through lane swapping. It has been well documented in competitive play that team compositions are more important than lane matchups (unless a massive gold lead is accrued in the laning phase), and thus, picking for the team composition will always be superior to picking for the lane.

There have been many notable occasions where the 2 solo 1 duo setup has been used in competitive play – in fact every time a lane swap occurs, Cpt Jack and Lustboy, is notorious for dying in lane 2v2, despite having good team fight play and mechanics. For many of their games this season however, they adapted by laning 2v1 either middle or top – reducing the impact of one of the main weaknesses in their team. If they had followed the traditional lane setup, this weakness may have been a greater problem during Champions. In addition to this, the 2v1 lane allows Blaze to fast push an early turret with the jungler, using the 2 solo 1 duo setup gave Blaze 2 notable benefits: 1) The ability to avoid their bottom lane’s weak laning phase and 2) Early strategic victory through fast pushing a turret.

Recent champion picks have also made it obvious that teams are now leaning towards two generic solo laners. To elaborate, Kha’Zix, Ryze, and Zed – all have previously been found in the traditional top and middle lanes. When previously there was well defined, non-overlapping champions for both the mid and top lanes, now the distinction is not so clear. Even champions who have only been played in the middle lane traditionally, such as Karthus or Orianna, in order to implement specific strategies.

Another interesting change has been for many teams to recently swap their “official” top and mid positions. While this has little impact on where the players lane, and Reapered’s old team all announced that they were swapping the top and mid positions, with Maknoon also talking about moving to mid. It appears that the reason for the change, with the exception of TSM, is to move the leaders of the teams (Hai, Reapered, Maknoon) to the middle lane; this may be indicative of a shotcalling position.

*Note: TSM’s Reginald moved to the top lane however

The 2 solo 1 duo setup provides flexibility, without worrying about individual lane matchups. It is not a strategy, but a framework that provides teams all of these benefits. While it has already made its way into competitive play, it is a development in the meta that has been almost overlooked by the average viewer, up until recently. This advancement is one of the most interesting progressions in competitive strategy to date, and I believe it will be very important, moving forward in competitive play.

It would be really helpful if you guys could make the word spread so more teams could participate and we could get some sponsors and get nice prizes for everyone

We hadn't got a thought in the prizes yet

The eSports scene over here is growing but it's still slow atm

We may not be able to stream all the matches, 8gb RAM and a HD 7850 2gb), think it can holds the stream. My friend got a 1mbit upstream connection and i think we can stream, at least, 480p or something a lil better, MAYBE 720p (i'm not pro at streaming services/settings).

So

We don't have enough money to pay someone to make a website for us and host it now

Sooo

______________________________________________________________________________________________
**I. Introduction**

Fresh off an upset over CLG in W4D1, as they took advantage of TSM's mid game disorganization. Let's take an in depth look at what happened.

**Team Comps**

**TSM:** **Rumble** (Dyrus), **Miss Fortune** (Chaox), **Taric** (Xpecial)

**MRN:** **Akali** (MegaZero), **Tristana** (Heartbeat), **Alistar** (AtomicN)

 TSM's comp has a solid mix of physical and magic damage and good aoe

MRN's comp focuses on diving the back line with Jarvan and Akali. With Nidalee, with Nidalee, Alistar's aoe heal, and natural spell vamp for Akali, which proved useful with the poke Xerath provided.

______________________________________________________________________________________________
**II. Early Game: [00:00-25:54]**

**[--&gt;[IMAGES] Early Game Timeline Analysis&lt;--](http://imgur.com/a/fAM4U#0)**

**Analytical Summary:**

The early game was extended and passive, especially for MRN who has used it exclusively in their LCS games. TSM set up for their predictable 3v1 dive strategy and MRN countered by swapping their lanes as well.

*

With the role counterparts laning against each other, which has been MRN's has approach to the early game in the past 2 LCS weeks. TSM was more aggressive on the gank path, but strong early game warding stifled any real success, amounting to a burnt Alistar flash [5:14]. This meant Jarvan took a small CS lead over Xin Zhao. However, TSM was able to out CS their lane opponents early, giving TSM the overall gold lead after 10 minutes.

*

Having little success against MRN's warding, playing off her overaggression, but miscoordination ruined the first gank [11:01], which should have been first blood, and caused them to double pink ward on the fourth gank [25:54], which should not have been attempted in the first place. TSM also ganked top, unsuccessfully due to MRN's passive play

*

After level 6, so it's hard to say for sure, but it's not unlikely Xerath's own aggression was the primary reason he was hit by so many spears. Throughout the game, Xerath showed a propensity to use his spells for little gain while putting himself in poor position, for example, in the early game at [16:02] and [22:39]. And while he warded well for much of the early game, he left his right side open at one point, along with his aggressive spell use

*

The most impactful event of the early game was the first dragon [15:02], given the circumstances. But without knowing his thought process, it's difficult to judge. Similarly, it's difficult to say how much thought MRN put into the dragon play. There's no way they could be absolutely certain that TSM had no vision or that TSM was too far out of position to contest (which, if TSM had vision, they weren't), and MRN has attempted dragons in other games that they should not have. However, the dragon call would be considered a good one. Without knowing exactly what MRN was thinking

*

Whatever the case, but an even more important aspect is that it greatly extended the early game as there was no shift to objective control. While this didn't put TSM at any disadvantages outside of the gold, it stopped TSM from taking advantage of their superior teamfighting ability, in terms of both their skill as a team over MRN as well as their team comp.

*

Overall, MRN had the lead, but the passive overall play in the early game meant neither team gained a huge advantage. In all, MRN was up about 2k gold at the end of the early game.

*

**Short Summary:** MRN's passive play and strong warding, extended early game. Akali's overaggressive tendencies allowed TSM successful ganks, but miscoordination cost TSM some of those opportunities. Xerath's overaggressive spell use also cost him, both early and throughout the rest of the game. The dragon play had the most impact in the early game, but it is hard to analyze. Overall, both teams played the early game well, with good warding and and relatively few mental mistakes.
______________________________________________________________________________________________
**III. Mid Game: [25:54-33:54]**

**[--&gt;[IMAGES] Mid Game Timeline Analysis&lt;--](http://imgur.com/a/uC5kL#0)**

**Analytical Summary:**

Finally, so were able to take dragon control, but they were caught off guard by Xerath's ult, chunking 3 [27:44]. This gave dragon control to TSM, and they started it. However, MRN had good sustain and were able to come back. 

*

The fight was well played overall, Jarvan still initiated a bit too early. Four members of TSM responded properly by peeling for MF. Had Xerath been in position, TSM would have crushed MRN off of the initiation, as Tristana and Nidalee would have been zoned easily, leaving just Akali and Jarvan together, focused by TSM. 

*

However, meaning he had a poor angle on MRN, an important consideration with Xerath's spell kit. Essentially, TSM fought without Xerath, as all his damage output was on Alistar. Had he taken the time to be in position, his damage would have taken Akali down before she could kill MF, leading to a decisive victory. Instead, despite the poor initiation and a better teamfighting comp.

*

After the fight

*

TSM then showed very poor mid game map control. MRN only had a slight lead, allowing MRN to move freely without pressure. This is a problem that TSM has shown in many games in the past, when they are just slightly behind and the enemy exerts some map presence.

*

The loss of map vision didn't have an impact on the next play, TSM had vision of 5 MRN members clearing baron area. This should have been a clear red flag for TSM to group, but instead, Rumble continued to farm bot lane, an extremely poor and very confusing decision. MRN was able to easily take the baron and panicked TSM into a desperate teamfight that MRN easily won with TSM so out of position, which then led to a free inhibitor.

*

**Short Summary:** TSM beat MRN in a teamfight as Jarvan initiated early, leading to an easy dragon for MRN. TSM then turtled hard and lost map control. MRN forced a baron, but TSM failed to respond despite having vision and time to do so. A desperation play by TSM led to an easy teamfight victory and inhibitor for MRN. MRN took full advantage of very poor mid game play by TSM.
______________________________________________________________________________________________
**IV. Late Game: [33:54-38:52]**

**[--&gt;[IMAGES] Late Game Timeline Analysis&lt;--](http://imgur.com/a/pUGms#0)**

**Analytical Summary:**

MRN now had a significant advantage. TSM caught them offguard hiding in a brush as they tried to push bot, but Tristana was too strong and MRN eventually mopped up, taking another inhibitor. Xerath caught Tristana, but the game was essentially over at this point. 

*

MRN regrouped to finish the game. Rumble saw them clearing a ward


*

**Short Summary:** TSM outplayed MRN in a teamfight
______________________________________________________________________________________________
**V. Key Points**

A brief list of the mistakes from above to improve on from this game:

***TSM***

* **Ability Use** - Untimely use of Rumble's skills led to a missed gank and a death. 

* **Positioning** - Xerath's overaggressive spell use often resulted in bad positioning. Xerath has long range, and he must be played with that in mind. 

* **Mid Game Map Control** - Poor map control constricted TSM. This is more about opportunity cost than any direct disadvantages.

* **Reaction** - Poor reaction to baron cost them the game. This has not been a repeated problem in the past for TSM and is unlikely to be in the future

***MRN***

* **Aggression** - Akali's overaggression toward Rumble led to successful ganks.

* **Team Positioning** - Grouping up before the dragon fight allowed Xerath to chunk them. Split positioning before the fight bottom lane meant they could not react immediately when TSM engaged on them

______________________________________________________________________________________________
**VI. Final Thoughts**

For me, I think my initial insights were correct. TSM's problem seems to come up when they are behind to some extent, and more importantly, the enemy team exerts some map control. They seem to respond to this by turtling and dropping very few wards, none of which are remotely aggressive. 

While it is not always safe to ward, and if the enemy is pushing a lane on their side of the map, they'll stand around waiting for it to push back to them, even when it should be clear the enemy team is not looking to 5 man push. This allows the enemy team to take their time and move freely around the map, forcing TSM into a purely reactive role. 

Even when it doesn't lead to any direct disadvantages, even though their passive wards still gave them enough vision. This poor mid game approach also played a part in the near upset of the W4D2 game vs VUL (though after reviewing the game, the effect was far less than I initially thought) as well as the W1D1 game vs CLG, and in games extending back since last summer. TSM typically is able to exert strong map control when they are ahead, but falter when behind.

*

Another interesting trend I've noticed was MRN's passive early game play. This has been the status quo for MRN since W3, MRN previously had an overly aggressive lane phase, attempting to gank without regarding the possibility of enemy wards, which caused them to be countered and allowed the enemy team to snowball the advantages from the early game to win easily (For example, see my [analysis on DIG vs MRN](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/18p7nz/indepth_analysis_na_lcs_w2d1_dig_vs_mrn/)) Clearly, they realized their flaw and have worked to fix it, showing a dramatic shift in focus away from ganking and toward passive jungle farming and laning in W3 and W4. While being so passive is not necessarily the best approach to the early game, and I would call them the most improved team over the course of the LCS.",t5_2wenn,True

## **Karma Notes**

# **Abilities**

**Ultimate: Mantra (R)**

- Think of it as having 4 ranks
    - Automatically start the game with “rank 1” Mantra.
    - Level-up at lvl 6
- Static 45 second cooldown
    - 27 seconds at max CDR
- Putting points in Mantra increases the potency of the Mantra’d abilities.
    - Ex: The bonus damage from Mantra’d Q (**Soulflare**) scales with points in **Manta** (R)


**Passive: Gathering Fire**

- Reduces mantra cooldown when you damage an enemy champion with a spell or auto-attack
    - Starts a **1** second
        - automatically increases to **1.5** seconds at **level 7**
        - automatically increases to 2 seconds at **level 13**
    - Half amount for auto-attacks
        - Ex: At level 13
    - Only works on champions
        - Huge drawback to jungle Karma

**Inner Flame / Soulflare (Q)**

- Almost identical to Quinn’s Blinding Assault (Q)
    - 75 less range and slows instead of blinds.
- Good poke ability; useful for triggering **Gathering Fire** (passive) in lane
    - You don’t have to hit the enemy champion; you can hit the minion they are standing next to instead
- **Soulflare** (Manta’d Q) does tons of damage early
    - ~170 damage at lvl 1 with 23 AP
    - The main spell you’ll Mantra throughout majority of the game
    - Slow + considerably large AOE (similar size to Brand’s Pillar of Flame (W)) makes it difficult for the enemy to dodge the damage.

**Focused Resolve / Renewal (W)**

- Does identical damage to **Inner Flame** (Q) and immobilizes the target if they don’t break the tether after 2 seconds
    - Can only target champions
        - Can’t heal off minions with **Renewal**
- Tether range is relatively long: 800 units (?)
    - Often forces a flash out of the enemy if they don’t have a gap closer
    - Weaker against gap closers
- Great for stopping the enemy after they’ve engaged / used their gap closer
    - Great for peeling for your ADC
- Recently changed **Renewal** (Manta’d W) from a flat amount to a percentage of missing health
    - Flat amount was probably too strong in lane but borderline useless late game
    - Makes health a more appealing stat
        - More beneficial to support Karma as she naturally builds health

**Inspire / Defiance (E)**

- Large burst of movement speed for a short duration
    - Feels more like Flash variant than a Ghost variant
- **Defiance** (Mantra’d E) creates huge swings in team fights
    - AOE damage with AOE shield and AOE movement speed increase
    - Main reason why Karma pairs well with divers (Malphite, etc.)
        - The more divers the better
- **Soulflare** (Mantra’d Q) still does more damage and provides massive AOE slow
    - Probably want to **Manta** E in teamfights where you have a lot of divers

*****

#**Mid**
- Similar to **Orianna**
    - Both champions tend to come out ahead in trades in lane
    - Both champions provide a lot of utility and control in team fights
    - Both champions have shields, and like to auto-attack when available

- In a lot of areas
    - **Karma** is more straightforward to play and more forgiving when you make a mistake
        - No ball

- **Orianna** farms slightly better
    - Can shove the lane faster due to line skillshot
        - More wraiths

- **Karma**’s ganks are better
    - Other lanes as well as her own (when your jungler ganks)

- **Karma** vs **Orianna** (damage)
    - Damage is very similar across the board when you consider practical spell rotations. **Karma** starts to do more damage late game

- **Karma** vs **Orianna** (mana)
    - **Karma** uses significantly less mana early and mid-game due to less spell casts and the fact **Mantra** has no mana cost

- **Orianna** probably pairs better with other AOE champions due to the displacement that her ultimate provides

#**Support**
- Feels like **Lulu**
    - Like Lulu
        - You can opt to level E instead if you need to play passively

    - Doesn’t push the lane quite as fast as Lulu but is similar
        - Circle AOE spell instead of line skillshot

    - Can all-in with more damage due to **Mantra**
        - Landing a Mantra’d Q (**Soulflare**) on both enemies heavily tilts the lane in your favor

    - Teamfight is incredibly similar
        - Likes all-in backline dive buddies (Malphite, Kha’Zix, Lee Sin, Evelynn etc) due potency of Manta’d shield (**Defiance**)
            - The more divers the better. **Defiance**’s shield and movement speed boost are *AOE* team buffs
        - Can simulate a miniature Lulu ultimate: Shield + Shard of True Ice

    - Karma can peel for the ADC better than Lulu
        - Both have shields, and movement speed boosts
            - Karma's E provides a massive burst of movement speed that is arguebly better for escaping in fights.
            - Lulu has to choose between polymorph (cc) and movement speed; can't have both
            - Karma can chain abilities: slow, to create a large peel buffer for her ADC
            - Wild Growth balances this out but ideally should be used offensively (not on the ADC) to get the most out of the AOE knock-up and AOE slow

*****

#**Builds**
- Cooldown is for sure the major core stat
    - Increases ability to poke
    - More spell casts in a team fight
    - Multiple Mantra casts during lane or - once you hit late game - multiple Mantra casts in a single team fight
        - 27 second cooldown on Mantra at max CDR

    - **Mid**:  should build 1 major CDR item (15%+ CDR) and get the rest from blue buff
        - Morello’s
    - **Support**: Lots of options
        - Locket, Morello’s, Athene’s, etc. + masteries

- After that
    - Raw **Ability Power** is good
    - Doesn’t suffer from “Zac disease;” itemization is in her favor. **Karma** benefits in some way from almost every stat

*****

#**Final Thoughts**

- Similar to **Orianna** when played **Mid**
    - Dominant in lane and provides utility and control in team fights
    - But Orianna is better at being Orianna. Her ultimate is game changing. Why play Karma?
        - Karma is more straightforward
            - Not just solo queue. I mean for competitive players as well
                - Not everybody can be TPA|Toyz

- Similar to **Lulu** when played as a **Support**
    - Doesn’t fast push as well so Lulu is a better fit to someone like Caitlyn
    - **Wild Growth**, especially in situations where you have a single backline diver. However, **Defiance**’s shield is AOE so it’s better with multiple backline divers and the cooldown is much, much lower.

- Can be played **top** lane
    - Hard to gank Karma due to her ability to kite and prevent / offset damage
    - Large variety of items are viable
    - Might have mana issues due to lack of blue buff
        - Chalice of Harmony should solve any mana issue. Look to pick it against magic-based champions as Chalice also has magic resist

- Can be played **jungle**
    - Leash is mandatory (srsly you’ll die)
    - Passive (**Gathering Fire**) doesn’t proc on jungle monsters (con)
    - Ganks are strong
        - Slow, 45s ultimate
        - Can apply red buff from range (525)

- Can be played as a [fringe] **attack damage carry** variant
    - Passive (**Gathering Fire**) synergizes with Hurricane
        - Max CDR + 2 attacks a second against 3 targets = 5s cooldown on Mantra
    - Nashor’s Tooth is an efficient source of cooldown reduction

- Incredibly versatile
    - Orianna (4800 IP) subsitute
    - Lulu (6300 IP) subsitute
    - Could be viable in other roles (top and jungle

*****

**tl;dr**: **Mid-lane**, is more straightforward, and more forgiving.

1361948922.0,19bdd2,I've done some calculations on new BotRK (the PBE version),iTroll-4s,44,2,68,"I've got interested in the new BotRK [by this tread](http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/198b2s/a_somewhat_indepth_look_on_quinn_new_botrk_and/c8lynnz) and I had nothing better to do at work so I've written a [python script](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5048172) to plot some DPS graphs.

It only accounts for basic things such as Crit chance, armor, HP, % HP damage and AS, it doesn't include advanced damage reduction (like block, ninja tabi, 3% reduction mastery, and block is not really significant at the level I'm doing the DPS tests it should be enough).

Anyway I wanted to see how new BotRK with 30 AD and 40 AS and 5% of current HP compares in DPS to the alternatives

How to read graphs : The first graph is avarage DPS graph, all graphs represent champion HP on Y axis and time spent auto-attacking on X.

Lvl 11 cait stats with 1 item and zerkers vs a champion that has :

* [1300 HP 50 armor](http://imgur.com/bnL7rtv)
* [2200 HP 100 armor](http://imgur.com/GpZiCrd)

Supprisingly (?) BotRK is the best DPS item for both cases (where BT is better than live BotRK on squishy target and IE is very close to PBE BotRK

Lvl 11 cait with ~8k gold worth of items vs a champion that has :

* [1500 HP 60 armor](http://imgur.com/MYW1gAE)
* [2500 HP 120 armor](http://imgur.com/1lcB3VO)

The BotRK+LW+BF sword combo (that costs ~ IE/PD combo) is actually equally effective at killing the squishy champion as the IE/PD (slightly slower) but it's the most efficient DPS item on the tanky champion

lvl 18 cait with full build vs a champion that has :

* [1800 HP 80 armor](http://imgur.com/ZG7LhLc)
* [2500 HP 120 armor](http://imgur.com/dlQAbQX)
* [3500 HP 200 armor](http://imgur.com/hxLzxg1)

Anyway these comparisons are just the DPS numbers, will be a core item, and it will merge two slots in to one - it gives sustain and attack speed and some AD, and it leaves you with the option to fill the missing AD/crit on your own, my idea is Atma's + Mallet, but who knows maybe PD will be better for MS/passive/extra AS for on hit effects.

If someone feels like going trough the script and checking if I messed something up feel free to tell me, it's python code and it uses matplotlib to plot graphs.

**Conclusion**

Early game

Mid game you can go for BotRK + IE, it will be weaker on a squishy but stronger on high armor - high HP and it doesn't rely on crits so it has consistent damage (and with 25% crit from IE it's perfectly possible not to crit for a long time, so BotRK + LW + BF sword is more reliable DPS).

Late game BotRK + LW + IE + PD is the highest DPS combo, the standard ADC combo (IE+PD+LW+BT) beats it just slightly on squishy target but loses on tanks.

EDIT: I've updated the lvl18 graphs because I accidentally calculated the non-botrk build with %HP damage that it doesn't have

EDIT 2: I've updated the graphs to show the avarage DPS along with a trial run DPS graphs I originally had

Hi all! After seeing some of the fan reactions to the results of some of the Allstars games

Something important to consider in watching League of Legends Esports is that while the results of games speak for themselves

I light of this, LPL stealing baron from NALCS. There are a number of ways this could be presented to the audience, but I want to look at two in particular.

1. ""StVicious fails to smite the baron properly""
2. ""Troll/ClearLove manages to pull off the steal""

At their core, and can focus the criticism of the internet like a laser.

Sentence 2, it focuses on the positive aspect for the other. This is how people build a fanbase, they get caster hype, their skill is recognized on the world stage, and builds an appreciation for such skill amongst the viewers.

With league being a zero-sum game (essentially, TSM set up an ambush that succeeded. YellowPete got initiated on? No, StVicious landed a perfect flash hook for his team. Dyrus dies 2v1 to PDD? No, PDD perfectly knows his damage to turn an adverse scenario. 

This suggestion isn't directed at any caster in particular

Thanks so much guys

## **[C9 vs CST](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4IPNtTnGSY)** - Full Game + Pick/Ban phase.

**SPOILERS BELLOW**

* **

^.

Now when someone mentiones Vayne, as well, Vayne was associated as a champ that fits split-push skirmish late-game teams. From our experience with Cloud 9, they don't seem to fit the criteria for a possible Vayne pick. That's wrong; and here's why:

^.

* **


## Team Playstyle:

Cloud 9 have this unorthodox (for the NA scene) style of play where they distribute the gold to their team evenly

While this seems counter-intuitive to the whole Vayne pick

Due to the gold being distributed trough the entire team

* ^^^^^.  Vayne was allowed to DPS undisturbed due to her team being just as strong!



* **

## Team Comp:

As touched in the previous paragraph

The team C9 ran had multiple disables on all of their champions and a very sizable Tank-line (With Lemon

Reaching Vayne is especially hard in that team comp. For one, Shiptur and Nintendude on killing Vayne. This brings me to my second point, C9 had enough damage on their own with Kennen, Elise and the farmed Nasus to teamfight once Coast had spent everything on going trough their peel.



* ^^^^^. Vayne was provided with Peel and the team had multiple threats!

* **

## Zed:

Vayne does very good against Zed. This is (as explained in the post-game interview) their main rationale behind picking the Vayne and is a very Valid one. Zed strives to split-push and duel anyone who offsets his split push. This strategy is often thwarted trough either hard engage (4v5) or Duelists.

This means C9 had the option of either going full on engage (with an Ashe) or getting a duelist like Vayne that can kill a Zed 1on1. The Ashe pick couldn't happen since they didn't have the AoE to dive whenever they please (much like the C9 vs Ves game) and that meant Coast could just stall for the Zed split push. This was effectively countered with the Vayne pick.

And not only Zed does bad vs Vayne. Both Zac and Renekton wane to her percentage-based true damage and Ezreal really can't do anything to a Vayne unless marginally ahead. That smart pick and ban phase that Lemon coordinated fell in place completely with the Vayne pick.



* ^^^^^. Zed and most of Coasts' comp does bad vs Vayne!

* **

## But Vayne should get all the gold! :

This is one misconception that people have within the community. While it's true that Sneaky doesn't wander off (Read: Split push) alone to bulk up his cs at the expense of losing pressure, C9 were actually the ones that initiated the fights. This meant that diving Vayne was tremendously more difficult and that gave Sneaky breathing room to do more damage most ADCs.



* ^^^^^. Sneaky got more gold trough objectives and had map pressure!

* **

## Playing the strong champions:

C9 have said on multiple occasions that their champion pool is effectively made up only of champions that are strong at the current moment. Due to recent events Vayne has had most of her counters in lane nerfed




* ^^^^^. Vayne is Strong right now! C9 pick and practise what is strong!

* **

Each part will analyze the teamfighting of 1 game from the 3 game playoff set
___
###I. Teamfight 1 [23:05-23:29]

**Analysis:**

###[[Images]Teamfight Breakdown &amp; Analysis](http://imgur.com/a/1EEoe#0)

The overarching theme in this teamfight is DIG's inability to play against split positioning

**Key Factors:**

* **Twisted Fate positioned poorly against GGU's split.** This led to TF getting caught out of position 3 separate times by the GGU players in the dragon pit. TF needed to ensure DIG had a proper tank line set up before moving closer to the pit.

* **DIG did not exercise choke point control.** This prevented DIG from maintaining the split and using it to their advantage. Instead

* **DIG did not maintain their tank lines against both fronts.** Instead, which GGU took full advantage of.

___
###II. Teamfight 2 [23:05-23:29]

**Analysis:**

###[[Images]Teamfight Breakdown &amp; Analysis](http://imgur.com/a/WQx8T#0)

Though this analysis is focused on DIG

**Key Factors:**

* **Zac failed to recognize GGU's positional advantage.** Though it was just for a second

* **DIG's back line clumped up.** Their singular focus onto Karthus caused the clump

* **DIG failed to respect GGU's zoning.** This split Draven from his team and let GGU get an extra kill on TF.

___
###III. Teamfight 3 [33:48-34:05]

**Analysis:**

###[[Images]Teamfight Breakdown &amp; Analysis](http://imgur.com/a/lXfcV#0)

**Key Factors:**

* **DIG failed to recognize that GGU had the situational advantage, which left DIG in a vulnerable position as Riven respawned. Their focus should have solely been on bursting Riven as she revived.

___
###IV. Conclusions From Game 1

In these 3 teamfights, they exhibit an all-in mentality, setting their sights onto their target and rushing toward it. This singular focus creates flaws in their positioning, which GGU exploited very effectively, and causes them to miss opportunities because they require things like zoning, which do not involve direct attack. When they aren't all-in engaging, it is simply because they are forced to retreat.

*

This is by far the biggest underlying problem with DIG's teamfighting in this game

The first teamfight can be described thusly: (1) Zac's good initiation splits GGU, (4) DIG singularly refocuses onto the GGU members inside the pit, (4) DIG retreats as GGU splits DIG at the unguarded flank.

The second teamfight is similar: (1) Zac's initiation splits off Karthus

The third teamfight: (1) The DIG initiation splits off Riven, (4) DIG retreats as Riven revives and catches them out of position.

If we analyze the teamfights starting at the point in which DIG engages

* /r/leagueoflegends is focused on community aspects of League of Legends and filters as little content as possible
* Neutral ground is a requirement for a news/content aggregate and Reddit provides this feature while providing all the necessary infrastructure. A subreddit is the perfect neutral area where everyone can be equal. 
* Having a filtered subreddit focused on League and League eSports will advance the scene in a positive direction.
* The freedom and ability to make changes necessary to facilitate and drive the community in a better direction. (Verification system, etc)

Above vod is from the lpl match this morning between OMG and WE. Maybe you will get an first impression what OMG brought to this game. 

**Intro:**

The current line up formed September 2012. The OMG the organization formed earlier.  Gogoing/san/cool are the 3 initial members during the September reform

**Style:**

The OMG style

* Vision Focus, for example, the lv1 top bush ward in the above vod against WE. 

* Strong Lane Phase. Laning period is very key time for OMG because they often gain enough advantage during this stage. No matter 1v2 switch or common 1 1 2 approach, individual mechanic, vision control and perfect calculation of trade/skill timer. For example: The Whole OMG team will keep check every single Flash/cleanse/ghost used by opponent and type down the timer and use it as an advantage if available. 

* Objective focus. Similar to many Korean teams

**Strength/Advantage:**

All 5 players in OMG line up are former top 3 rating in Chinese Solo Q ranking. They still have 4 of them in the top 15 and 2 of them in top 5 now. The only member that is outside top 100 is OMGsan but he does not play solo q anymore after reach Rank 1 back then. The understanding of the game and mechanic skills of this OMG team are amount the best few teams in China. They still have the highest average solo q rating in LPL (IG and WE has many members play in KR server instead)

Work rate. OMG is considered the best team in China to perform a setup plan from lv1 till end of the game. From the above Vod you can see they play the whole game just like a machine. 

Snowballing. OMG is known to be a team that hardly or never throw away any early game advantage. Their ability to keep snowballing the game is very impressing and often a nightmare to opponents which like to make mistake somewhere early in the game (like IG). 

**Weakness/Disadvantage:**

Team fight. Still a very young team

Come Back. OMG still has alot to improve in playing games from behind. Because of their style they often win in early game which also means they lack experience and knowledge how to play in games that they are not winning or losing. 


**Members:**

*Support:*

**OMGlovelin**

*Prefer picks:* 

Thresh / Lulu / Sona / Zyra 

Lovelin is the most important member of this OMG team. As a support, hes getting more and more recognition now and pulls target ban on his thresh almost every game. 

*Facts:*

* He use 1 13 16 Masteries, MR Glyphs and GP10 Quints on thresh/sona/lulu. he may use different marks on Zyra, most likely Mpen. 

* His lv1 item always is Mastery item pair (cookie and ward) + 4 sight wards + 1 vision ward + 2 red pot. 

* Hes support style is very traditional Chinese style

* His laning mechanic, both will stay far away from each but in range of Sona's heal. they will move towards enemies and harass with skill/autos on different target at the same time and move back at the same time with a sona heal. because Sona's heal able to sustain both unit, they wins the trade by out sustain opponent. Also his Zyra ulti combo with san's MF ulti also a terror to face. 

* During his solo q times

*AD Carry:*

**OMGsan:**

*prefer picks:*

Caitlyn / Graves / MF / Varus

San, which allow other member of the team to have room either to dive or protect him. His teamwork with lovelin often consider one of the best in China, maybe next to Wx/Fzzf. 

*Facts:*

* He does not play solo q on his acc for a long time but it still remain at rank 113. but still very far from the rest of the team (but weixiao's rating in china server is only 2100 which is not even top 500). 

* Hes one of the rare top class adc in China that main graves in current meta. 

*Jungle:*

**OMGbigpalemo**

*prefer picks:*

Volibear / J4 / Vi / Noc 

Bigpalemo, It was Palemo who play as jungle in that team (CL is a mid player). With very similar playing style and skill level, Palemo like to make plays just as much as CL. His 2 go to champion, Voli and J4, both are playmaker type of jungler and he often pick up both aura items (locket/bulwark) because Lovelin the support hardly build any real item beside vision related. 

*Fact:*

* hes the 1st ever player in the world to play Sejuani in competitive play

* hes one of the best junglers in China to be able to survive with heavy set backs. In his game with Sejuani against IG

* he often just stay around top when come to lane focus. but he wont give up chances available at other lanes. hes not a heavy camper like many others that spend a minute of 2 to make a gank. he often choose to farm up or help to set up visions around the map while Lovelin is stuck in lane. 

*Mid:*

**OMGcool:**

*Prefer Picks:*

Khazix / Diana / Orianna / Karthus / Jayce / Eve

Cool is a very versatile mid laner that able to play most of the meta champions. He often play AD mid because that gogoing like to play ap top (Cool was a former top laner and gogoing actually main Mid before becoming a pro). Cool was also a member of the team that include palemo/clearlove/fzzf. Hes a very stable player, he showed hes very capable in carrying also. 

*Facts:*

* Played 7 out of the 17 games as AD mid in LPL. 

* His average cs per game is 270

*Top:*

**OMGogoing**

*Prefer pick:*

Rumble / Malphite / Renekton / Shen

Gogoing is a famous solo q player before he joint OMG. He has been to the Rank 1 of solo q in both S2 and S3 before. As a former Mid player, hes also a very strong tank/front line player. Gogoing is consider as good as PDD and Caomei in China and has alot respect from other top laners. 

*Facts:*

* His solo q reputation mostly from his insane mid lane plays. But he has never play mid in pro-level. 

* Hes the only few top laner around that can actually out-lane PDD 1v1. 

* He is considered as the best Malphite in China and perhaps world.

57 Champions have been picked (Zed has been banned but not picked)

**Top champion performances**

* Miss Fortune maintains a 100% Win Rate despite being picked up 5 times.  This is the longest 100% win streak in the EU LCS. She is also rocking the 2nd largest KDA in the league (18.5) Which is why we believe she deserves the title “Champion of the League”

* Renekton 72% win rate across 11 picks

* Sona 60% win rate with a massive 20 picks (87% of games) 20th KDA (4.5)

* Katarina has top KDA (26) 2 picks and a 100% win rate  

* Leona has a respectable 4 picks 75% win rate and 5th KDA (7.6)

For Junglers, Volibear) and have sometimes been played in other lanes, so their jungle stats have not been separated out.  Snoopeh's Maoki is a big standout 2 picks 100% win rate and a 0/0/21 stat line.

**The most desired champions** (Popularity=Picks+Bans/#of Games Available)

* Xin Zhao and Thresh are the only champions with a 100% Popularity in EU LCS

* Shen, Vi, Caitlin, Elise, make up the next big chunk of desirable bans from 87% to 70% Popularity

Of these champions Sona

Most Elise bans have come from Gambit Gaming.  Elise has been banned by Gambit Gaming in *every single game they've played.*   This has led to a couple of hypothesis about Elise.  Gambit could be overvaluing Elise

Xin Zhao has been on the losing side of both EG v SK games.  So his highly sought after strength is certainly not game shattering. His league statistics don't really indicate a reason for his 100% popularity

**Worst champions performances**

* Zyra has 8 picks, or underpowered, she certainly has had the most underwhelming performance

* Cho' Gath (1 win 5 loses) and Elise (1-4) Are near the bottom

* Graves, Singed, Wukong all have 0 wins but have only been played in 2 games.  Wukong has impressively managed to be right around the median KDA.

**The least desired champions**

There are about a dozen champions with very very small popularity.  Their win rates are mostly 100% or 0% and either way don't tell you much about the champion.  However

* Amumu has been picked once

* Nasus is in the same spot as Amumu. 1 pick, and now the bear has massive popularity.  Will the same thing happen to Nasus?

* Singed has been used to great effect over in the NA LCS.  EU LCS has yet to see a great game out of him in his 2 picks.

* Katarina is unpopular

* Irelia this former Queen of top lane has only been picked once (for a loss) and never banned in the EU LCS. 

**Bans**

Most of the bans are relatively uninteresting.  Usually teams have banned champions they know the other team are comfortable playing

* EG has been the most successful at making other teams scared of “oddball” picks (anivia

* Kha' Zix received far more bans in the beginning of the season than currently

* GG has banned Elise in every match 

I find it interesting that in the best of 1 format we haven't seen bans to protect a certain composition.  It seems that in this format it may be advantageous to find an odd strategy that you think works well in most situations

###I. Introduction

Recently

&gt;[League is a game of pressure.](http://www.icallmid.com/?p=6) The drafting stage is to help you create a team composition to help pressure the map and win you the game. If you can outpressure the enemy team

&gt;[...] Recently

&gt;[To put it simply, you are simply a placeholder [...]

&gt;[This happens every time we lose and this easily results into a snowball effect.](http://www.icallmid.com/?p=11) Somebody dies -&gt; they get a tower -&gt; more towers -&gt; map control -&gt; dragon/baron and then well

Here are the important points to glean from above:

* Pressure is at the core of snowballing advantages.
* Those who fail to apply pressure are idle placeholders.
* Lack of pressure is the main factor in most losses. 

In short, dragons, barons, and other objectives. Pressure forces enemies to areas of the map, creating openings in which to take advantages. 

However, as the end goal itself. When used defensively, pressure is created to threaten a higher priority target, forcing enemies to respond and direct focus away from their original target.

In this analysis, affected the decisions and movements of each team and caused the outcomes in all 3 examples.

**VOD:** http://www.twitch.tv/japanesports/b/405353438
___
###II. Case 1: [22:11-22:56]

The first case is a fairly straightforward application of the situation from above

###[[Images] Play Breakdown](http://imgur.com/a/jedGQ#0)

**Analysis:**

For whatever reason, by applying pressure mid, OMG was able to indirectly alleviate the pressure top. The pressure forced WE back to mid lane to defend the higher priority inner turret before they could reach OMG's top turret, cancelling the disadvantage and even allowing OMG to come out ahead in the end with some free damage onto the turret. 

___
###III. Case 2: [20:04-21:26]

A secondary benefit of pressure is that it often spurs teams into making bad decisions. This is not something that should be counted on

Case 2, but ends up gaining much more from it. 

###[[Images] Play Breakdown](http://imgur.com/a/08p6w#0)

**Analysis:**

OMG found themselves in a disadvantageous position due to Malphite's teleport and the dragon respawn timer. However

OMG also recognized the teleport engage threat, the pressure spurred WE into a poor engagement attempt, leading to a relatively straightforward teamfight for OMG, picking up a 2-1 win and the dragon off the back of it.
___
###IV. Case 3: [33:26-35:53]

In the past couple months, and is still often overlooked.

One explanation for this is that map pressure mistakes lack a direct feedback mechanism. Unlike most mistakes, obscuring the true cost of the mistake. In other words, disadvantages caused by missed pressure opportunities often arise far after the opportunity initially appeared (future costs) and are typically best expressed in terms of foregone advantages rather than direct disadvantages (opportunity costs). 

In case 3

###[[Images] Play Breakdown](http://imgur.com/a/X4ODK#0)

**Analysis:**

By far the biggest factor that led to WE's baron was OMG's failure to respond to the creep wave pressure bot during their window of opportunity, almost a full 2 minutes after the missed opportunity.

A second missed opportunity occurred as OMG retreated after taking the mid inner turret. Though it would be a risky push

As you can see, the thought process would not be ""let's clear bot to prevent baron"", but rather ""clear bot to prevent some sort of disadvantage that might come from the creep wave pressure"". This results in a much more nebulous connection between map pressure and disadvantage than, say, the instant negative feedback after getting caught. 

Nonetheless, which can very well be considered the turning point of the game.

HotshotGG (Top)

Chauster (Jungle)

Link (Mid)

Doublelift (AD)

Aphromoo (Support)

**Team Overview:** 

CLG is the name synonymous with League of Legends professional e-sports. Being the longest standing and most recognized team since Season One also comes with increased pressure. CLG placed 4th place in the Fall split of the NA LCS, which has recently shown little results in terms of tournament wins. However, the overall raw talent of the team is immense. CLG's strategies have remained standard since it's formation, with the designated ""Hotshot Split-Push"" and ""Protect the Doublelift"" comps. CLG is looking to revive and rebound this summer. Hopefully, the added pressure will allow them to shine.

**Team Strengths:** 

*The Doublelift Show*

CLG's AD Doublelift has always been in the discussion of the best AD carries in North America

*Quiet Consistency of Link and Aphromoo*

Since the pick-up of the two newest members, he has quietly gained a reputation as one of the top 5 supports in NA. When comparing him to his predecessor, Locodoco, he and Doublelift are now one of the most in-sync bot lanes in LCS, in hopes of rectifying the DL/Chauster bot lane. Throughout the LCS, Link had almost fully adopted playing only Lux and Orianna with an occasional AP Nidalee thrown in. Furthermore, he has one of the largest champion pools of all NA mid laners. In terms of consistency

**Team Weaknesses**

*Inability to adapt to the meta*

Since Season One, it's holding them back. Aside from a single Karthus top game that went horribly wrong, Hotshot always plays a straight tank, a split pusher, or both. His lack of champion pool always causes targeted bans usually this being Chogath, Malphite, Shen
The one threat

*Team Communication*

Between HotshotGG, even in scrims it was apparent that CLG was plagued by communication flaws. Everyone wanting to get their two cents in isn't a conducive environment to winning games. Miscommunication is apparent in games when Doublelift gets caught face checking a brush, or Hotshot gets ambushed by 3 people. Whether CLG needs one shot caller and leader, or perhaps a devoted team manager to get them back in line, something must be done.

**Team Expectations**

CLG's recent streak of disappointing matches could very well continue if their match against Vulcan is any indication. However, and they're finished as a team. This leaves no room for error or excuses. The added pressure of no longer being a professional gamer, will force CLG to rise to the occasion or crumble under the pressure.",,False,,t5_2wenn,,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1dx52s/na_lcs_team_overview_clg_513/

I know that a while back Elementz used to always get slammed for his tier lists but I decided to make one more along the lines of ""power rankings"". This particular [Tier List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmxKqVsJqGJ2dGVxaUxKejJIdDN4RDEyNnBqMXJLTWc&amp;usp=sharing) is based completely on statistics (wins and losses).

The beginning stages of this tier list will be rough and champions will change placement on a weekly basis. Just off of the 1st 3 weeks there has been some interesting patterns that have formed and I encourage you to take a look if you're interested in statistics of that nature.

Some of the things that I have noticed...

* NA and EU have about the same size champion pool (NA=57 EU=56) although they did use different champions (68 total).
* Graves
* Miss Fortune, Katarina, Alistar, and Twisted Fate are the best so far
* Malphite and Singed are great picks for NA.
* Miss Fortune is a great pick for EU.
* NA needs to avoid picking Graves, Jayce, and Anivia.
* EU needs to avoid picking Wukong, Jayce, and Graves.

I will be keeping record of all the matches like this

Basically everything he said is true

What he said, but until now it's been a one-way street.

This is definitely true, have been emulating Korean strategies (and Koreans have taken one or two ideas from NA/EU), and China has opened up to team comps that are designed for more than just beating WE/iG/OMG in the LPL. It's no surprise that Cloud 9's LemonNation has watched all the OGN Spring/Summer games. Even before the LCS Summer split started, they were playing team comps that are common in Korea, and MonteCristo (the analysis caster for OGN games) said that they would win this LCS split because of that... *before the Summer split even started.*

But there are other reasons that NA doesn't do well on a global stage.

First of all, by the way... that's how big eSports is in Korea.

NA has *at least* a few years before their infrastructure can reach the level that Korea has right now. Any Korean team that has a sponsor also has a coach and an analyst working for them (often more than one). Remember when Dyrus said, every pro team in Korea has that and more.

**And there's even more reasons...**

Asian teams (again, TSM and Curse can scrim together if they want, but they won't be able to practice their secret strategies. Blaze and Frost don't care about that problem nearly as much, because they have the same sponsor.

And even if you ignore the advantage of ""sister teams"", most NLB teams would probably do better in the NA/EU LCS than most NA/EU LCS teams. This is partially because Korea is a stronger region, due to their financial support, and also because there's less of a skill gap between NLB--&gt;OGN than there is between the amateur NA/EU teams and the LCS teams in NA/EU.

To put it in perspective... remember Najin Sword from S2 WCS? They're in NLB now. Granted, ~~which is now also an NLB team.~~ Apparently they haven't qualified for NLB, my mistake.

Don't get me wrong, and a better infrastructure, and the *huge* amount of money that supports Korean players... NA/EU teams would be very competitive worldwide. But I don't see that happening in time for the world finals.

**TL;DR**: LemonNation was right

1372912217.0,1hm5k4,A Look at the New CLG (Basic Overview) /xpost from Leagueoflegends,SIDLOTF01,39,6,12,"-------------------------------
**Reliance on Doublelift and the Spring LCS**

Spring Split CLG relied heavily on Doublelift to win their games, but for the most part, the team hung of the back of their star ADC. This CLG paradigm was not due to lack of skill among other players, but was rather because of individual play styles.

HotshotGG often favored tanks, Malphite, and Cho'gath in a majority of his games. Instead of playing carry toplaners to pose more of a threat in lane, he opted for tankier champions to split push for map pressure, and then to damage soak in teamfights. While this strategy was not *unsuccessful*, it did add a certain level of predictability to the team before the game had even begun. Other LCS teams never had to worry much about a ""wildcard"" factor coming from the toplane, becuase they understood the distinct way in which Hotshot played the game: pick a high-durability-low-threat champion, farm as much as possible, opponents can find the pattern and subsequently abuse it. A prime example of this was the recent OGN Finals in which CJ Entus Blaze, HotshotGG never truly posed too much of a threat simply because his opponents were able to work around his limited champion pool and play style.

At the mid lane was Link, the team's jungler, was extremely underwhelming and consistently failed to make big plays or carry. 

This left a majority of the carrying job to Doublelift, or Ezreal due to his extremely safe nature. Aphromoo's lack of longtime synergy and experience as a support, however, kept Doublelift's lane a bit suboptimal. This is not to say Aphromoo wasn't a good support, but there was a clear discrepancy in Doublelift's performance when compared to Doublelift's season 2 play, or his Allstar performance when paired with Xpecial, one of the best supports in North America.

All in all
----------
------------------
**The New CLG**

Before the summer split of LCS began, retired, along with Aphromoo. Nien was acquired to fill the top lane, but was previously an ADC player and thus lacking any competitive top lane experience. BigfatLP, the former midlaner and sub for the team, was recruited into the jungle, and Chauster was switched back to support

After three weeks in LCS, is tied for second place. 

**Link Rising**

Abandoning his old utility/poke oriented play style (Orianna, Link has come out swinging during the summer, playing champions such as Zed, Twisted Fate, Karthus, and Jayce, champions *who make kills happen*. Link thus far has played spectacularly, if not harder in some instances, get Nien a kill and help him snowball. Link's performance has drastically improved since the Spring Split

**The Surprising New Top**

Considering the fact that he was not a top lane player before this Summer Split, and continues to improve with each game. He has thus far demonstrated an extremely diverse champion pool and varying play styles, from tanking with Malphite, to carrying with Elise, to somewhere in between with Jarvan. Those who saw the CLG v TSM game saw Nien flourish and demonstrate the beginnings of what will hopefully be a fantastic season for the rookie top. With a hard work ethic and proper practice, combined with his impressive mechanical skills, Nien has the potential to become one of the best.

**Bigfat Returns**

While previously the mid laner for CLG, as the new jungler for CLG, bigfat has foregone the lane phase entirely and instead become one with the jungle. While Chauster is often hailed as the mastermind by CLG, bigfatlp possesses a certain brilliance in-game that makes him incredible to watch. Bigfatlp builds as a tank exclusively, regardless of the champion, in a way that is a bit reminiscent of Hotshot. The difference here, however, bigfatlp's unique tank style is harder to abuse than a top laner's. In addition, he possesses a rare gift among North American junglers: the ability to time his smites perfectly. Simply put, is what makes bigfat the behind-the-scenes hero of the team.

**Finding Their Roots in the Bot Lane**

During Season 2 of League of Legends, was arguably one of the best in the world. Doublelift was coached by Chauster, who had previously been the team's ADC, and the mentor and student quickly became one of the most feared duo's in the game. Chauster was eventually switched to jungle, but after an extremely disappointing performance there, he has made his way back to support. While Chauster is still obviously the weakest member of the team, he has demonstrated in the past that he can be a top-tier support. Currently his performance fluctuates as wildly as Curse's has this split: he will either **[make an amazing play](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9plbE0FscIM)**, which he most certainly has the capability of doing

**A Bright Future for CLG (the TLDR)**

CLG has essentially taken everything that made them weak previously and changed it. While there are new problems, their old problems have been widely dispersed. The predictability of their top laner is gone, and now actually have carry tops when they are needed. The team has an outstanding jungler that provides presence and extreme objective control, coupled with excellent team fighting control. Mid lane has seen a tremendous growth and is sometimes the biggest threat on the entire team. Bot lane is now only one part of a triple threat team, rather than a 1.5 or two threat team. I truly believe that if CLG can overcome their current issues such as re-prioritizing objective control and working on where they funnel their CS, CLG can be the #1 team in NA.

I made a post on r/LoL but as you all probably know

A nice redditor, wishing for a constructive discussion around this issue.

My Original post reads:

""As a Rumble main
First of all I see there's a lot of discussion whether Rumble needed a nerf. IMHO, he was really strong (I think he will still be strong). People's argument is that Rumble has had the highest win % of the game for quite a while, while a valid argument, Rumble's win % is highly affected both by people not knowing how to play against him properly (well, at least in Silver I'm pretty sure people don't) and by only being played by people who do know how to play him proper, since he ain't a popular champ.
About the ult.. it was way too strong
I think with this change
Now.. about the spreadsheet, if the opponent stays exactly 2 seconds on the ult, you will be dealing more damage than before (not truth if you stay 2.5 seconds). Same applies for 3 and 4.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvuNgCEOn0dDdFkwdEdaRFFlckZVdTFTWUEwVzkta2c#gid=0
Please let me know if there's something wrong with it
TL;DR: Ult dmg nerf balanced Rumble and is not as bad as people think. At exactly 2
EDIT: Just noticed that @lvl6 with 70 AP you will be dealing 3 more dmg than before if opponent stays 1 exact second.

EDIT 2: Can't test cause I'm at work,2s,3s,4s) or (0s,1s,2s,3s,5s) ? (would really like to have help on this one)

Edit 3: Fun fact: At 0.5 seconds

* Mid Lane: xPeke
* ADC: CandyPanda

Interesting Evil Genius doesn't claim top spot in any position

**Champion Pool**

With only 24 games we can't entirely judge a players champion pool

Method of Measurement

To measure champion pool first we look at number of champions a player had played divided by number of games they've played.  We'll call this the variety coefficient, or but there are many other factors in a loss.    

**Wide Champion Pools**

* Bjergson, Shlaya, Shushei, Spontexx, Virtu4l have played a different champion in each of their games. 
* Of those Malunoo, they have run through quite a wide selection of champions in their 4 games.
* Hyrqbot has played 6 different champions
* Alex Ich, over 6 or 7 games, with good win loss records.  

**Smaller Champion Pools**

* Supports Karalius, and haven't felt the need (or have been prevented from) to play another champion
* Next smallest are EG Wickd and Yellowpete.  ADC don't draw a lot of bans, but from what I've heard about Wickd's stream (Top Karma, Top Zed) and all the emphasis EG has put on expanding champion pools, I wouldn't be surprised if his pool is much larger than he has shown us.  
* Exter also has a relatively small champion pool.  He has played Ryze or Twisted Fate in 6 out of 7 games.  With a record of 3-3 on those champions

My conclusions from looking at champion pools are:  I feel like Hyrqbot is being underrated, champion pools, which has allowed their other players to stick to a small roster of champions for the time being.  I literally have no idea what the next team comp out of Dragonborns will be.

**Player Awards**

* The Serial Killer (most kills in a single game) Kev1n's Olaf 11
* Undying (most 0 death games) Froggen 4
* Best Friend (most assists in a single game) Nyph Sona 22
* Skumbag Award (most kills in a single game by a support player) edWard's Sona 4

**Random Facts that didn't fit anywhere**

* Fnatic has won the 2 fastest games 24 min (beating CW) and 28 min (beating AAA)
* Sk has the slowest win 49.08 min (beating CW) 
* Average game length is about 40 min.
* Blue and red have split nearly even 13-11
* Most common first ban is Vi (5/24)
* Most common last ban is Shen (6/24)",,t5_2wenn,1361929736.0,,Viktor,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/199n2d/player_statistics_going_into_super_week_at_the_eu/

1371777646.0,1grlun,Curse: The Ebb and Flow of the Meta,paulz0rs,37,7,21,"In the early days of LCS Spring Split, champions in the game. Elementz, I just go around

Taric and Jarvan received substantial nerfs to both of their main stay skills (the W and E respectively). Assassins that power-up at level 6 and 9 as well as specific champions that Voyboy pioneered have received the brunt of the nerf hammer (Elise [release], inability to take advantage of strong 1v1 early game], Diana, Olaf, Nidalee [falling out of meta due to 2v1]). Unmovable mid laners such as Morgana have fallen out of favor, only to be replaced by AD assassins that clean-up fights rather than start them (Zed, Kha are the most popular). Although much seething rage was spewed over keyboards about Curse's bot lane since Week 7 of the LCS Spring Split, the meta and Curse's current champion pool does not favor their early aggression style.

Curse excelled at having two options during the early laning phase: 2v1 or let Voyboy 1v1. Voyboy, Voyboy remained supreme as the epitome of 1v1, balls to the wall, ""kill-you-snowball the lane"" ability. He was highly touted as one of the the best top laners in the world. A great representation of this is his 1v2 Olaf against AG in the S3 qualifier (against V Bloodwater's old team, no less; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjOBv8SlVb4[1] ). However, this style soon died down due to the CJE Blaze Flame (old strategy, but effective) strategy of freezing the lane and slow-pushing after the early tower siege as well as the emergence of a more prevalent and smarter 2v1 early game. With Curse's reluctance in securing early dragons or sieging more towers (4~6 minutes), decreasing any skill disadvantage between the two laners.

NyJacky remains one of the most adorable players in the League of Legends scene. Even without a pair of boobs and a generous push-up bra, NyJacky's fun demeanor does not translate well into today's League of Legend's meta. Never known as an AP-carry, Jacky tends not to carry games because of his rather average laning phase and teamfighting. Jacky is not terrible in both aspects. He does not die much in lane, nor does he teamfight horrendously. He is never behind much in CS, but he is never ahead by much in CS. His play style may result in an inability to capitalize on Curse's early aggression. It is fine that Jacky is solid during the early laning phase; however, he never snowballs. With his play style, he cannot snowball. One of the major weaknesses he exhibits is his inability to roam or counter the roam. He loves pitching a lovely tent for his teddy bear in that mid lane without putting too much pressure when the jungler or opposing mid laner is away. This allows the other laner to roam more frequently and make more plays (and with Edward as well as Saint's [he only buys 1 ward; places it at banana bush/Jacky's wraith ramp on purple/blue at ~6 minutes] lack of warding during the 8-15 minutes of the game) which becomes a large problem to the other Curse laners. Jacky and Curse made up for this with a strong mid lane brickwall champion like Morgana or an inherently gank-heavy champion like Twisted Fate (his kit is built for vision control and ganking) to make up for Jacky's weakness. Fitting to this post's theme, thus weakening Jacky and Curse.

Cop is currently the most hated AD on the planet. He takes way too much unnecessary flack for his ""lack of skill."" Mechanically, and keeps alive. Yet, like Jacky, he is just lacking that ""something"" that would put him over the top. To put it in perspective, he is like the Chris Bosh (NBA basketball player) of the team. A team player in every sense of the word, he does specific things well, but MENTALLY, Cop tilts. ""Why am I so bad?"" he often asks himself. Doublelift makes up for his often self-deprecation with outlandish claims that, does not see that he is improving. The words of the people as well as his teammates (Saint

Edward. Love his play style. Makes aggressive plays all around the map during the mid game. However

The jungle may have changed, Saintvicious has not been keeping up with the times. Something has happened that has negatively affected our oldest LCS member. Like the Chevy Vega (a highly marketed and praised car in the early years that fell apart later because of reliability, safety, and rust problems), Saintvicious, once praised, is lauded as arrogant, and fitting to his name, the manager of Curse, his smiting prowess has increased). His safety during the mid/late game is suspect (watch All-Star LCS 2013 against China

Curse has never been a phenomenal team fight team. They channel most of their energy into dive compositions (though they tried a poke composition one time during the Summer Split, Jarvan (and perhaps Olaf, Elise, Akali [clean-up]) as the main front line, designated to dive the enemy's back line as soon as possible, quickly seeking to eliminate any semblance of enemy counterplay. Cop was allowed to wreak havoc with evasive/long range AD carries like MF, Cait, and Corki while his support protected him. However, tries to get the team comp of their choice as their top priority. Unfortunately for them

The end of Spring Split (weeks 8-10, Kha as top tier first picks, nor do they choose the champions that would fit their style like Karthus, Orianna, Kennen (a champion that is very strong when acting as a protector of the AD rather than a dive champion due to well known knock-back counters like Janna), Shen, Rumble (still strong), they have very few prioritized options that they fall back on (a nerfed TF, Tryndamere). This allows for so much counterplay due to the bans that the other team can do. With this advanced knowledge, ""THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T BAN JAYCE AGAINST CURSE (snort snort)."" Also

However, Akali, and Katarina.  All of these champions scale off of AP, don't use mana, and are often matched against other AP champions.  Through these three factors alone, most of the standard starts are outright eliminated as options.

* **Cloth Armor and 5 pots** - While some AP champions will punish these melee-range champions with auto-attack harass
* **HP pots, the mana potions are obviously useless.
* **Faerie Charm, the lack of mana makes Faerie Charm worthless.

This leaves us with, all of which are sub-optimal:

* **Fort Pot, and with the increased cost, doesn't seem worth it, for something you get minimal scaling off of.  Also, the one HP pot leaves you with a significant lack of sustain.
* **5 HP pots, leaves you lacking a lot of stats for 475 gold.
* **5 HP pots, but just leaves you 155 gold behind your enemy at the start.  It also just feels bad to leave base not having spent that much.
* **Null Magic Mantle and 2 HP pots** - What you lack for sustain you make up for in defense.  This start compensates for a week early game with increased defensive stats.  Still
* **Amplifying Tome and 1 HP pot** - The Aggressive start - lacking sustain

1367291854.0,1ddyqd,Any analysis of GGU?,kpxice,36,6,23,"Are there any articles on GGU's playstyle? Haven't really seen any

Here are my two cents (just from looking closely at PlayOffs):

**Strategy**

Their team strategy utilizes their two largest strengths (ZionSpartan &amp; DontMashMe). ZionSpartan will continually split-push the side lanes which forces the enemy team to respond. Usually the response is one of two options:

1) Send 1 member against ZionSpartan

2) Send all members and push another lane

**Accordingly:**

*Send 1 member against ZionSpartan* -
ZionSpartan will decide either to engage or retreat. If he retreats, the enemy team basically is forced to sacrifice a lane to either ZionSpartan or the other 4 members... or both.

*Send all members and push another lane* - 
This is the most common response I've seen. GGU seems to deliberately avoid pushing the mid lane while ZionSpartan pushes the side lanes. This makes very good sense. GGU wants to force a favorable teamfight under a GGU turret. At the end of the day, DontMashMe becomes a huge factor.

**Random Notes:**

1) GGU has always picked ZionSpartan's champion after other team has selected their top-laner (At least since Playoffs). Seems like they really want him to win his matchup.

2) ZionSpartan's common picks (Riven, Khazix) are all extremely hard to pin down, have great wave clear, and can deal lots of damage.

3) GGU's splitpush is a little different from CLG's splitpush because CLG tries to push both lanes at the same time.

4) Of GGU's 5 losses in playoffs, TF, Karthus) in 4 of them. The 5th loss, ZionSpartan chose Rumble.

1362607139.0,19svwq,The Viability of Sivir,SirCookieMonstyr,37,7,68,"Recently there was a thread about the viability of Ashe, or through changes to her abilities

I'm going to refrain from making this an insane wall, please point it out!**

**To start off

Her base AD is average, but is hardly efficient if the opposing lane trades with autos, and it relies on counter-play in order to function.

At 387 HP, and as you know all adc champions share 30 base MR and 0 MR/level.

Her range is one of the problems that immediately brings up issues with her base HP and armor: At 500 range, this opens her up to very unfavorable trades early against common picks such as Ezreal, Caitlyn and even Vayne early on. Kog'Maw can get around this low range through his W, and it can be argued that Sivir can hit targets outside her range with her W. However, these hits deal less damage and the ability is rarely leveled to a point where it trades favorably until the laning phase is over.

While her range is problematic in the laning phase

**Next

**Sivir's passive** is very similar to the Furor boots enchantment, getting into range without taking extra damage can be problematic. 50 movespeed is a large increase, but it doesn't scale throughout the game. It is very strong in teamfights and with positioning, but with her short range it ends up rather lackluster.

**Her Boomerang Blade (Q)** has very long range, with a percentage reduction). However, the damage potential on this ability is higher than any damaging ability of any other adc:

Doing some basic math, before armor/arpen is taken into account) hits for 748.8 physical damage (maximum damage - without maximum it hits for 915.2 physical damage). This is a huge chunk of damage - *but it has a 20% reduction per target hit on both spins to a minimum of 166.4* at the same level and AD. Hitting multiple targets diminishes the damage of this ability a truckload. It is also very gimmicky to land on targets due to it's long range and slow projectile speed. The range is definitely very strong, but can be detrimental in some cases.

**Ricochet (W)** is one of the most awesome abilities for any adc - your attacks can hit multiple targets! While the initial attack is limited by her base range, this ability also has a percentage reduction per hit with a minimum damage. The mana cost and considering the opening level 1 damage boost makes it very mana inefficient to use for quick pokes/trades during the laning phase, and can run you oom in fights!

Again, but it is sometimes (especially during the laning phase and teamfights) very difficult to predict. There seems to be no preference between champions, monsters or minions, and it simply goes for the closest available target.

**EDIT: Silly me

W resets your auto animation

**The Spell Shield (E)** is a very nifty ability that also serves as Sivir's escape/survival mechanism (her ultimate can also be counted as such, or any ability that is already on affect on your champion, nor for any AoE ability that remains on the floor.

It is incredibly strong against champions that rely on a single spell to deal a large amount of damage or hard-CC ability, and as such cannot give mana on demand.

**Finally, this ability scales incredibly well with an auto-centered team and especially with other AoE steroids such as Armor Shredding, Taric's R, and such. Do not misjudge her ultimate in a team that includes Jax, Jarvan IV, Taric and Elise - from personal experience I can tell you they hurt!

The big downside: a cast time. Using it as an escape can often get you caught in that one second of casting it, which, as mentioned before, is significant.

Unfortunately

**EDIT: Her ultimate does affect minions (no cannon confirmation but multiple reports of it - I'll check it out soon^tm ). This opens up very strong split-pushing potential outside of her already strong split-pushing

I think that, her ultimate could be potentially gamebreaking with damage output.

**What does Sivir have going for her (besides luck - engineer reference^lame ^joke)?**

She has very high damage output potential

**The downsides?**

Very short auto range

Her walk animation is terrible! Not to mention the bug that makes her attack and Q animation disappear. Her ultimate requires a cast time and her mana costs are pretty high.

**Some concluding thoughts:**

Regarding item builds: feel free to discuss them, it would take ages for me to incorporate that in here effectively. How she performs with the new items is something I haven't personally tested yet, so please give some feedback in that regard if you can! I'll try my best to try her out as well.

Regarding ruins and masteries: As with item builds, with AD marks/armor yellows/mr per level blues and flat ad/lifesteal quints on her mostly, but haven't played her a whole lot in S3. I don't want to theorize too much before I'm sure of what is silly and what is workable - this is where input would be very much appreciated!

------------------------------

I would like to know your favorite odd picks/builds.

Here are mine. Don't forget

I personally love Lissandra for her all-in initiating power. However I have to admit she is lacking a lot if your AD picked something can't capitalize well on agression. If you are losing the lane and you don't get some help  from your jungler, Boots of Speed, Zhonya. (Morgana Support Style.) Don't forget you can now build shurelya but also michael's crucible out of the philo stone. I recently learnt you gained MS and a heal when using it (for those wondering you can use it on yourself too).

I also enjoy playing AD Thresh as a support when the lane is doing well. Philo, BotRK, Phage. With tons of Magic Res /lvl for glyphs. Max E, get every soul, don't forget to ward, ???, profit. 

AD Carry Thresh + Blitz is actually quite good too. I think I have a 75% win rate out of 15-20 games. When I play AD Carry I go BotRK, 2xZephyr + last item. CDR as thresh spells cds are super long, super good AS, tons of MS and a bit of AD (u actually rely on your souls as much as you do on your AD: I'm usually dealing 2/3rd phys and 1/3 magical damage which is a pain to itemize against when I get the advantage.) It's not OP but still pretty viable as it scales well into late game thanks to the souls.
I'd like to add that Zephyrs are actually quite good to stack as you only lose on the tenacity. All the other stats stay available.

Finally I think Nautilus is really nice. He used to be my main support before his W nerf. And now that they reverted it back

I've also tried a lot of other supports such as Kennen, Elise even before pro players did but i was maxing the wrong ability (noob me), lux, fizz, jayce......... But I don't want to write too much as I want to get some ideas from you.

So, I don't think that's the only solution.

Azubu TPA just came off a win in the Garena Premier League against the ill-fated Kuala Lumpur Hunters. While it wasn't the most competitive of games, so they weren't exactly lacking on the AD front. With incredible amounts of poke from Toyz and Bebe, on top of relentless splitpushing from Stanley's Shen, they were able to grind out a win. The combination of Nidalee and Soraka fascinated me - two heals and strong poke means that it'll take a lot of effort to stop Nidalee from farming. 

It got me thinking - what other ways could we remove the AD carry from the equation, on Shen). In its current incarnation, I believe Blade of the Ruined King serves two purposes:

* Cheap lifesteal item for carries
* Anti-bruiser weapon for autoattackers

Riot probably intended it this way. Blade of the Ruined King is currently pretty effective at doing those two things. It doesn't leave you helpless against the League of Warmog's and is a versatile item capable of being picked up by a variety of champions. 

I propose this: it is no longer necessary to have an AD carry to beat bruisers and have a strong lategame. Plenty of champions are very strong in the lategame, dealt out frightening amounts of damage, and certainly more upfront damage than any AD carry could match. Karthus is a favourite of many teams around the world - Froggen used to love incorporating Karthus into a standard 'CLG.EU lategame' comp. Many more high DPS champions exist, such as Cassiopeia, Tryndamere, Jax, Jayce...the list goes on. 

So my question to you guys - what kind of comps could we see that don't incorporate AD carries? Bruiser Urgot used to be immensely popular, it was a diss against Frost, *but it worked*).

1369818286.0,1f9c0r,Olympus Champions Spring 2013 - Semifinal Preview - SK Telecom T1 #2 vs MVP Ozone,manisier,32,3,12,"Hello friends, but it is inevitable as both of these teams are very distinct and obvious in their strengths and weaknesses

**SK Telecom T1 #2 vs MVP Ozone**

*Overview*

This is the semifinal no one saw coming. SK Telecom T1 (affectionately dubbed 'Judgment Day' by OGN casters DoA and MonteCristo) come into the match in their first ever Champions berth as an immensely ferocious and crowd-pleasing team. Declaring that they will be the first ever team to royal road Champions off the back of their superstar mid laner Faker

The MVP side defied all expectations as they hounded CJ Entus Blaze, it would seem, as Ozone lost one game to KT Rolster's traditional strong laning and early Baron plays, only to take three games in a row to close out the match and secure their right to face Judgment Day.

*Minimum Impact Gaming - Top Lane*

**Impact** and **Homme** represent Judgment Day and MVP Ozone respectively in the top lane. The term is a bit of a misnomer, where top lane juggernauts such as Shy, Flame, Expession, Reapered and Maknoon claim their home). 

Impact lives up to his name, Impact has delivered fantastic performances mano-a-mano, utilising his previous experience as a jungler to predict ganks from the brush and dropping very few deaths in the laning phase. All-in-all, the Judgment Day top laner is a versatile, solid and reliable player who occasionally shows flashes of brilliance, putting the team on his back when they fall behind. 

Homme is perhaps the HotshotGG of Korea, the Korean metagame has shied away from Shen in recent weeks, and we may see similar tanky champions picked up by Homme such as Zac, Cho'gath or even Trundle, who after his rework has seen high amounts of play in the Korean solo queue ladder. The Kennen pick is also an option, as Homme elects to play Kennen in a more defensive role, using Slicing Maelstorm to stun those who would dare dive Imp.

Neither player is expected to dominate this match-up. Out of 100 games, and we can expect both players to fulfill their role for their team. 

*DanDy Unchained - Jungle*

Judgment Day's **bengi** and MVP Ozone's **DanDy** will head for the woods as their teams meet in the semifinal round. What is perhaps unusual is that both players have shown incredible mechanical and playmaking skills throughout their careers, as both teams put their hopes on their carry players to close out games - specifically Faker for Judgment Day, and Imp for MVP Ozone. In the last round, bengi dominated NoFe as he ganked wherever the Najin Shield jungler wasn't, while DanDy had his hands full trying to deal with Korean All-Star inSec in the jungle. This game, the two initiate-heavy players will square off against each other as they finally have the opportunity to test their skills against a jungler of similar playstyle. 

bengi has played his role near-perfectly this season, trying to shut down the rampaging Imp, while also ensuring that Impact has the resources necessary to play whatever role Judgment Day requires of him. Interestingly, despite Faker being the centrepoint of Judgment Day, bengi has not paid many visits to enemy mid laners, only really appearing in the lane when he detects a possible gank against his teammate.

DanDy has struggled to achieve the form he had in previous iterations of Champions. In the past, his team is certainly far from weak, which brings into question whether he is actually as good as the public considers him to be. DanDy employs a 'jungle duel' mindset, favouring counterjungling, early ward clears, and counterganks as he attempts to support his team by mitigating the impact of the enemy jungler. Against bengi, DanDy will definitely have his hands full as he finally has the match-up where his strengths shine. However, as his lategame teamfight performance is not quite up to scratch

Other things being equal, while DanDy will succeed if he matches bengi at every turn.

*Mother Faker Gentleman - Mid Lane*

The second-most anticipated match-up of the round of 4 isn't so because Judgment Day's **Faker** and MVP Ozone's **dade** are guaranteed to clash with each other in an explosion of farm and kills. The second-most anticipated match-up of the round of 4 is so because solo queue hero-cum-professional player Faker is involved. The young mid laner has dropped jaws and led many to question whether or not he is actually human. With an absolutely logic-defying performance on Leblanc and an uncanny ability to make plays on Twisted Fate no matter how lopsided the match-up

Faker employs an explosive, Faker's champion pool is also diverse, capable of picking both high poke champions like Jayce and Nidalee, and snowballing on assassins like Kha'zix and Leblanc. 

dade, as that is one of the few avenues Judgment Day will seek to take in order to topple the MVP side. Rather, he will try to outpush Faker and pressure other lanes with the use of Teleport on high CC champions like Diana. One of two star players on the old CJ Entus team, dade's playstyle is incredibly similar to Faker's, though he may pick less risky champions such as Lux or Ryze from time to time. 

In a vacuum, the performance of both mid laners will come down to how much they can push advantages around the map, rather than how far of a lead they can extend over their opponent. The games will be a learning experience for both players, as the winner must move on to face one of the CJ Entus mid laners, considered the best in Korea: either Frost cornerstone RapidStar, or Blaze All-Star Ambition.

*Mata In The Bank

Superstar bottom lane meets superstar bottom lane as Judgment Day's **Piglet** and **(Pooh)ManDu** ready themselves for the onslaught of MVP Ozone's **imp** and **Mata**. Both bottom lanes have performed very well throughout champions, this time with greater pressure.

Piglet and ManDu have displayed praiseworthy synergy, though against Mata he will seek to take Sona and Thresh away, with the threat of more unorthodox picks like Leblanc and Fiddlesticks if they are not banned. Although not the shining stars of Judgment Day, Piglet's impeccable mechanics and Pooh's ban-drawing support play will seek to quell the imp hype and show the rest of the world that the Hundred-Acre Wood is Korea's most dangerous duo lane.

imp and Mata will draw the attention of viewers, from his tendency to get caught). The young talent of MVP Ozone is the core of their wider strategy of protecting and peeling. Mata is a reliable support player, who like ManDu enjoys seeking out kills and setting up ganks for the jungler. Also like ManDu, on a bad day, Mata looks very weak, diminishing imp's ability to carry. imp will be required to carry for MVP Ozone to win, seeking out hypercarries Vayne, but it is more likely that he will contest the top support pick in Korea: Sona.

*Overall Match-up*

Paradoxically, MVP Ozone. Like the CLG of days past, MVP Ozone's ability to turtle and leave the game in the hands of their superstar AD carry will prove a formidable stumbling block to Judgment Day and their desire to close out games early.

SK Telecom T1 #2 must:

* **Win the early game**. Without all three of Impact
*  **Bring the show to MVP Ozone**. Judgment Day absolutely cannot play to MVP Ozone's tune. They must control the tempo of the game and punish the weak objective control of their opponents.
* **Get Faker farmed**. dade and imp are immense threats to Judgment Day and if they cannot win in a shut-out

MVP Ozone must:

* **Minimise early losses**. Judgment Day will force objectives
* **Protect imp with their lives**. The dive threat of Impact
* **Play their roles**. Unlike Judgment Day, DanDy must not fall behind, while dade and imp absolutely must farm to the best of their abilities, to the point where they have to take jungle camps and empty lane farm to stay even or ahead of Faker and Piglet.

*Predictions*

Any outcome could occur, I believe that SK Telecom T1 #2 will win, but the nerves of their young players may get to them if MVP Ozone clutch an early lead.

CLG failed this week. There's no other way to put it. They lost all of their games, to be hinest, neither of them have been carrying the team as hard as doublelift had been doing last season, which is perhaps to be expected). Personally, I think there are a few solutions, or outcomes, depending what they choose, to change.


First, to say he's innovative would just be foolish. Yes, he tried the karthus top lane this weekend, and it worked out okay overall (failed one game, worked surprisingly well the next). However, the karthus top is more of a gimmick than anything. I don't think it's something that can genuinely be continued to be used effectively. Anywasy, back on track. What hotshot needs yo do (imo etc), which is my preferred idea, we all know he can play certain tanks, he needs a bigger champ pool. The karthus idea was on the right track


The other idea to fix the hotshot problem, which affects both sides of the coin; Personally, I love watching him perform when he does well, and it seems that the people who aren't his biggest fans, love to hate on him even more. I believe hotshot has a place in the league of legends professional scene, I'm just no longer sure if it's playing for a team if he's not willing to change SOMETHING about his play. I don't want to see him go, but something needs to happen.


Second, as I think most people would agree that, although he is new to the roll, he has been doing a good enough job that he isn't having a huge negative effect on his team. Yes, he's gotten caught a few times, but who hasn't? So, on to doublelift. This past weekend must have been one of the most painful for him. He likes to trash talk (though to me, it seems to all be in jest), as long as teams ban out his vayne
So, most people wouldn't have denied that he was one of the best ADCs in the world. Now with even his fans with some doubt that he's as dominent as he once was, what does he need to do to regain our faith? Well, he seems to have said it best himself; he needs to, too, expand his champion pool (https://twitter.com/CLGDoublelift/status/315279720541474816). Now, you might be thinking, didn't he say that all of the ADCs he doesn't play are garbage?"" and if so, maybe a lot of pride)
Now, we can start with chauster. Before he was their jungler, he was probably the best support in the world (at the time of course, I'm sure there is a 10 page document of Asian supports that are better than him now). The transition to jungle seems to have been a weird one for him. He's come up with a decent amount of innovative strats, which are fantastic, which is exactly what CLG seems to need. However, like in season 2, in season 2, he seems to continue to want to play the support jungler role
Of the remaining 2, I think everyone was very hopeful that he would be able to fill jiji's role in skill, but also be able to fill the void that jiji left, meaning having a mid laner that would have an impact on more than just mid lane. This isn't a bash to jiji, obviously, as I love him to death. The point is, though, in CLG's past game vs V, one game does not make up for a month of not really disapointment, apart from MAYBE voyboy


Well, but there needs to be immediate changes period. SOMETHING has to change. Doubelift has started the train, and maybe this past game of CLGs will start something, since they had moderate success with the katarina and karthus picks.

As a content creator, monetizing the clips. This means that they are personally making money by taking other people's content. The streamer/tournament gets none of that ad revenue, and often these clips contain copyrighted content (i.e. music).

So why does this matter? As a fledgling industry still, new viewership, and public opinion of their games compared to other large eSports. The behavior of the community has a very quantifiable effect on public perception of the sport, and one need look no further than the CapCom livestream fiasco where even more conventional media outlets took notice not of the thriving community behind the sport but rather the practices condoned by their leadership which many would consider unacceptable.

When our community engages in practices that are unethical, and making money from stolen material is punishable in real life outside the wild west mentality that exists still on the Internet.

More importantly, are available very soon after the event and often during the event itself on YouTube. People who want that precious karma can simply link to a timestamp in the video rather than uploading it their own channels. That way, the views/ad revenue still go to the people who are really responsible for the content being created, and tournaments can see more attention and return on their events, which in turn benefit us all. Twitch vods can be similarly linked by adding t=xxmxxs at the end of the url, and the attention/revenue for the clip would again go to the streamer who made it.

Currently, see here:

###I. Teamfight Breakdown

###[[IMAGES] Full Teamfight Analysis](http://imgur.com/a/1EEoe)

The images above breakdown the entirety of the teamfight. In the sections below
___
###II. Key Concept: Choke Point Control

Zac's excellent initiation into the middle of GGU created a split, choke points are generally the easiest locations in which to create a zone, an area of control that enemies cannot move through because of CC or damage threat. More spacious areas require a proper team positioning to control, but narrow chokes typically require just a single player to create a zone. Thus, the dragon choke point was an integral point of control in this teamfight.

Yet, so it is usually difficult to control a choke point for an extended time. 

Furthermore, teams that are split can simply take a circuitous route and regroup. Though this wastes time, it is oftentimes not enough for the enemy to take advantages off it.

**The Dragon Choke**

The unique characteristics of the dragon choke, making the choke an ideal location to control and abuse enemy split positioning:

* **Dimensions** - The dragon choke has almost no length, while still being narrow enough for the player to cover it easily. 

* **The Pit** - The dragon and baron pits have just 1 exit. Therefore

**Abusing Split Positioning**

From [23:15] onward, giving DIG enough threat to control the dragon choke. At [23:16], DIG had obtained control of the choke, with Zac in position to enforce the zone. It was then time to take advantage of GGU's split. 

The first objective for DIG should have been to split GGU further, they could then turn freely onto the GGU players trapped in the pit before the GGU carries could react and regroup.

However, they lost choke point control. This allowed Riven to easily flash past them at [23:18] and establish choke control for GGU instead. With DIG now separated by the choke point, GGU focused the DIG carries with the numbers advantage, winning the teamfight.
___
###III. Key Concept: Tank Lines

Competitive LoL has progressed greatly from the days where, while such simple mistakes are no longer made, top teams still sometimes fail to position well with respect to their tank line in more complex situations.

The main goal of tanks is to protect the squishier carries, preventing enemies from moving past them and getting to the carries, and block, stopping enemy skillshots from hitting their carries.

**Maintaining Tank Lines**

Throughout this teamfight

At [23:14], DIG was focused on following up with Zac. Thus, for the second time in the teamfight, Twisted Fate was caught with poor positioning, and was caught by an Elise stun. Meanwhile, GGU spread themselves out well, giving Ezreal the opening to chunk TF through the 1 man tank line. Without a tank line for the GGU members in the pit, moving to the top of the river. However

At [23:16], and Lee Sin forming the line between the GGU carries. However, this was just a transitional moment. DIG had simply noticed how low the seemingly trapped Elise was, and were all moving down into the pit. With the tank line broken at [23:18] the GGU carries were able to flank and split the DIG carries from the tanks, focusing them down with ease. Furthermore, TF once again did not keep proper positioning with the respect to where the tank line was, and was instantly bursted down by Riven.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1draci/teamfight_breakdown_ggu_vs_dig_dragon_teamfight/

1366043918.0,1cebgq,Why ranked 5s matchmaking should be based off both individual and team MMR,ManWithYourPlan,41,16,54,"I posted this in r/leagueoflegends and didn't get much of a respons. Hoping someone here could give me some insight/clarify somethings as to whether or not this would be a good idea. Sorry if it's somewhat of a vent. Let me know what the issues are with it.


**Tl;dr** Ranked 5 Match making should incorporate **BOTH INDIVIDUAL MMR as well as TEAM MMR** in order to avoid ridiculously imbalanced team match ups. 

Hey everyone


I just wanted to take a moment to explain my thoughts about the Ranked 5's system. I have been playing LoL since the release of Kennen (April 2010), mostly because I would be trio or 4 man arranging with my friends. With the change to the league system, Myself and my friends decided to really go at it this season to see what we could get by way of ranked 5s. We already had a team from the last seasons so we just stuck with that.


We initially did pretty well in our placements coming out with a 4W2L ratio. We were placed in Silver 3, just to see what we were able to accomplish. We played a handful of games and got to our Silver 3 promotion series with no losses at the time. Things were looking up and we just shrugged off the low placement.


To give you an idea


The first team we faced in our promotion series utterly crushed us. It was a team with nothing but diamonds


We were annoyed and bummed that we had been matched with people that were so much better than us, we were all still completely blown away by these Match ups we were getting. Now we're back into the promotion series and our first match up should have quite a few Well-known names in it. [See if you recognize anyone on this team](http://i.imgur.com/ctous3l.jpg).


My point is, and we have an 11W8L ratio. WHY ARE WE GETTING MATCHED WITH PLAT AND DIAMOND LEVEL TEAMS? I understand that there is a different MMR for Teams and Solo Queue, and that is why were are getting matched, but that is the problem. There is NO REASON we should be playing against these types of teams. As much as I would love to say I am Diamond 2 and 1 material, I am not anywhere near that good.


So what should be done? How can Ranked 5s be made fun without the burden of being matched with teams that have ridiculously higher skilled players than yours? IT'S SIMPLE REALLY. All that would need to be done would be to incorporate individual MMR as well as Team MMR into the Match making process. You match people/teams of Diamond and Plat level ratings and skills against other people/teams with that kind of skill. You can make it broader to reduce the limited number of teams in higher brackets. All it would take is to make Bronze, Silver, and Gold tier players. Plat, Diamond, and Challenger can play against other plats, diamonds, and Challengers.


This method would allow teams of lower skill to actually be able to advance through even the lowest of divisions and tiers without having to play 50+ games together to have their MMR settle out with a negative Win/Loss ratio. Once you get to the top of Gold

1365846290.0,1c9gf8,NA LCS &amp; The Race for the Top in Week 10...,monkeysDice,30,2,18,"With the penultimate week of the NA LCS down the fierce battle to stay out of those bottom 2 slots

With the only 2 wins separating 1st and 3rd and every team having to play 5 matches in the last week it should make to be an interesting watch. What's even more interesting is the chances of a tie situation are more than likely especially with Dignitas &amp; TSM both sitting on the same score and both all but certain of a handful of wins.  

Here's what the LCS Rulebook has to say about tie-breaking the ladder:
&gt; **7.3.2 Regular Season Tiebreaker.**
 
&gt;In the event that two teams are tied in the standings at the conclusion of either Regular Season split (as defined as having the same winning percentage)

&gt;Tiebreaker games will be played following the final day of the Regular Season

&gt;If three or more teams are tied

&gt;Side selection for all tiebreaker games will be determined by a coin flip.  

The interesting take away there is that the 'Head-To-Head' record between Dig &amp; TSM is 2-1

IF TSM/Dignitas tie for 2nd/3rd place but Dig wins that match then they maintain their lead in the Head-to-Head record and retain 2nd place

  
  




...of course if they don't tie the season then all of this is redundant and doesn't matter

PS: It's also theoretically possible (but less likely) that Curse might tie with one of the two

Curse 2:2 TSM

Curse 2:1 DIG (With 1 last game to be played in Week 10)

1362947020.0,1a1fsw,A new way of calculating gold efficiency,sooneday,33,3,11,"One way of calculating an item's gold worth is to use basic components as a baseline value and break down advanced items stats into their basic components. The problem with this is that different champions value different stats so this doesn't tell you how efficient an item is on a specific champion.

A more accurate way of calculating item value is to use damage gained per kilogold. First you calculate the damage of a champion with runes and masteries. This is your baseline. Then calculate the damage with items. Find the difference between your item damage and your baseline damage multiply by 1000 and divide by the cost of your items. 

The reason you use kilogold instead of gold is because using damage gained per gold gives you too small of numbers. Higher values of Δdmg/kgold means more efficient items.

---

Here's an example using a lvl 13 Ashe with 21 offense and flat AD runes. (I'm ignoring armor because neither build will have a LW).

base damage = 96.35 AD * 1.00 Attacks/second = 96.35 dps

damage with BT = 196.35 AD * 1.00 = 196.35 dps


**BT Δdmg/kgold = (196.35 - 96.35) * 1000 / 3200 = 31.25 Δdmg/kgold**

damage with IE = [166 * 0.75 + 166 * 0.25 * 2.55] * 1.0 = 230 dps

**IE Δdmg/kgold = (230 - 96) * 1000 / 3800 = 37.9 Δdmg/kgold**

BT + dagger + dagger = 196 * 1.15 = 225 dps.

**BT + 2xdagger Δdmg/kgold = (225 - 96) * 1000 / 4000 = 32 Δdmg/kgold**

This shows what most people already know. A BT is slightly less gold efficient than an IE if you are focusing purely on maximizing autoattack damage.

1372207700.0,1h2r8r,An idea to remove Thresh from the ~100% pick/ban list (x-post from /r/leagueoflegends),Nostalgia37,47,19,41,"This is an expansion of a[ comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1gzguc/ezreal_meets_the_box/capitut) I made earlier. *You do not need to read that comment to understand this post as I will reiterate what I have previously stated.*

Since Thresh was announced approximately 6 months ago people have said that he would be at the top of the list of ~100% pick/ban champions. Most shrugged this off as almost every champion appears to be OP before they are released and that this new champion would be no different, these things are not what makes Thresh such a sought after pick. He has the ability to set up ganks and save teammates like nobody in the league before him thanks to his trademark lantern. On top of all this, he has an attack range of 425 that allows him to harass the enemy ad fairly safely in lane. Since his abilities themselves are strong because of their effects and not because of the insane amounts of damage  or the free stats they provide to a team it is extremely hard to balance because tweaking numbers will do nothing to stop him.

The only real ways you can nerf abilities like these are by reducing their range, it does little to stop the problems that required the ability to be nerfed, and it just annoys everybody who has played the champion prior (ask Diana players about patch 1.0.0.153). Thresh's cooldowns are long enough in lane to allow you to react to him if he misuses an ability, so a cooldown nerf will also do little to change his laning or presence in fights. Of these three options, mana cost nerfs would probably be the Riot's best bet at reducing his ability to make plays happen in lane. While this might make him less contested in lower divisions of solo queue, in higher divisions and in competitive play, where players know how to manage high mana costs and can consistently land skill shots

At this point in the post you might be thinking to yourself ""But Nostalgia37, on both a competitive and personal level, makes the game much more boring.  Furthermore, the game is getting close to the point where the team who is smarter during the picks and bans phase will win the majority of their games. If this is how the game is meant to be played at a professional level, which I believe it is, then Riot must  allow competitive teams to spend their bans on champions that their opponents play well and not force them to ban champions that are insanely OP.

Getting back to the point of this topic, Thresh’s passive lets him collect the souls of enemies that his team has slain. These souls give Thresh bonus armor and ability power, with the value of each soul diminishing as Thresh fills up his lantern. What some people may not know is that, depending on the level of Thresh’s E ability, Flay, souls give him bonus magic damage on his auto attacks. This bonus damage increases the longer Thresh does not attack with a base damage of the number of souls Thresh has collected. This would be alright if Thresh was a melee ranged character and had to work to get that auto attack in, but with his 425 range he can, hit you like a truck whenever you try to cs. Since his all-in is so strong because of his massive amounts of cc he should not be able to zone so well. This was similar to Kha’zix problem (although not to the same extent)

While it would be possible to nerf Thresh’s base stats so that he would be vulnerable when he goes in to land an auto attack, this would do little for his auto attack dps since the majority of his AA damage comes from his souls. Rather than remove the passive on flay, or lower the amount of damage he gets from it I propose that the chance of souls spawning from a slain enemy be reduced. 

If souls were less common then it would mean that he gets a lower base damage bonus on his AA and that he is much less tanky later in the game. This would also make it more important for thresh to pick up every soul in lane and would give him the option of going out of position, and relieve some pressure on the enemy, or not collect the soul at all, and miss out on stats for the late game. This would make his mid game much weaker and would allow for some more counter play to a champion that lacks any apparent weaknesses.

TL;DR Lower the chance of souls dropping.

###I. Introduction

Without gameplay mistakes, all teams make mistakes, and these mistakes are almost always the main determinants of the outcome of a certain play or game. Yet, there are exceptions:

In the 3rd game of TS vs DIG in the NA LCS Summer Promotion, but rather from the team compositions. DIG played well in their own right, but excellent strategic play allowed TS to start a snowball of their picks that DIG was helpless to stop. Unfortunately, TS was unable to keep up their level of play, creating openings that DIG expertly pounced on to turn the game around.

In this analysis, after which the key ideas and events are then summarized in section IV. We end with some short final thoughts in section V.
___
###II. Team Compositions

**Team Comps**

**DIG:** **Jayce** (KiWiKiD), **Ezreal** (imaqtpie), **Zyra** (Patoy)

**TS:** **Shen** (Grim Samurai), **Varus** (otter), **Sona** (L0CUST)

**Draft Order:** Ezreal -&gt; Shen/Sona -&gt; Jayce/Zyra -&gt; Nasus/Varus -&gt; Rammus/Ryze -&gt; Syndra

Throughout their relegation matches

* **Shen/Nasus:** This top/jungle combo has great tower holding potential against an AD/support combo; Nasus has strong wave clear and Shen creates strong threat with his taunt.

* **Varus/Sona:** This combo has great harass and solid wave clear from Varus

The above 4 picks are typical of recent TSM compositions, TSM picks a comp that is well-rounded in all aspects, but has especially strong early game pressure.

A common TSM comp in the last weeks of the LCS was something like this: 

* Top: Rumble/Renekton 
* Jungle: Nasus/Cho'gath 
* Mid: Diana/Twisted Fate
* AD: Caitlyn/Varus
* Support: Sona/Thresh. 

The key roles in this comp are the jungler and AD/support. The jungler must have strong wave clear and the AD/support must have strong tower pushing capabilities. The top and mid roles are more flexible, in which the jungler then prioritizes towers over jungle farm and alleviates pressure from the enemy AD/support lane, while the AD/support lane heavily pressures the enemy turret. The goal is to gain an early tower advantage, which they use to snowball.

As you can see, it is run in the same manner. However, it was the last picks that allowed TS to gain an overwhelming team comp advantage and create strong early game pressure:

* **Rammus:** This pick was the main determinant of the early game. TS' early strategy focused on punishing 2 key weaknesses of Rammus: (1) he is relatively blue dependent and (2) he has poor wave clear. TS knew they could cripple his jungle with early blue control and easily get a tower advantage with a 2v1 swap

* **Syndra:** This pick shows how TS adapted their focus to Rammus. Not only does Syndra have solid wave clear that allows her to pressure well, which they clearly planned from the start with this pick.

TS left mid open in order to counter pick, TS clearly has a far better ability to manipulate creep waves and create pressure. In the next section, we will see how they snowballed this advantage.
___
###III. In-Depth Analysis

The following image timeline constitutes the crux of this analysis:

###[[Images] In-Depth Analysis](http://imgur.com/a/jU8eD#0)


The main factor for TS' early game advantage was not a gameplay mistake by DIG

1. **Seamless Transitioning** - There was essentially no wasted time throughout the early game with TS' extremely smooth transitioning

2. **Map Pressure Recognition** - TS applied and responded to pressure very well

3. **Priority Awareness** - TS understood the relative importance of different objectives and made sure they were always taking full advantage of the best opportunities.

Because of the nearly flawless play

Blue Control -&gt; Tower Control -&gt; Dragon -&gt; Blue Control -&gt; Tower Control

After DIG was caught off guard by the invade, some vulnerabilities were bound to pop up as a result of the first 2 events, no matter what they did.

The next section will summarize each of the events and put the information from above into context
___
###IV. Summary

**Step 1: Blue Control**

By taking control of both buffs

The most impressive part of this play was the transition after the steal. Though they committed all 5 to the blue steal, rushing to secure the second blue with Shen, who would have otherwise just stood in lane getting denied.

**Step 2: Tower Control**

By crippling Rammus, using Nasus to hold tower instead of clearing the red buff. Thanks to Shen's earlier help, Nasus transitioned to the tower as the creep wave hit, maximizing experience and gold while minimizing tower damage. After taking top tower, TS wasted no time, pushing in and transitioning bot.

**Step 3: Dragon**

Again

**Step 4: Buff Control**

This is where TS really began to shine. With dragon gone, TS stole the second blue buff. They then transitioned back to natural lanes and secured their own blue, losing nothing and making full use of their time.

TS' excellent recognition of map pressure opportunities created a blue steal opportunity while simultaneously stopping the top lane freeze. Instead of falling victim to farm denial in the frozen lane

**Step 5: Tower Control**

TS continued their amazing play, Nasus already transitioned mid and got free damage onto the turret. The pressure caused DIG to gank, but TS was completely prepared with Sona and Shen ult. Though Shen ulted in unnecessarily, TS simply adapted and used it to start a legitimate push onto the mid turret, which they grabbed easily.

TS' choice to send Sona mid is the epitome of their incredible early game play. TS didn't just take advantage of openings in DIG's play, letting them take full advantage off a small opening.

**Step 6: Dragon**

Here, the more important mistake was the overall lack of preparation, which should have started well before the dragon spawned. 

Showing poor prioritization now, TS was in poor position to contest a dragon that they should have easily taken. Though it does not excuse Syndra's mistake, TS should have never been in that type of position to begin with.

After this point, and DIG did well to recognize these mistakes and capitalize off them.
___
###V. Final Thoughts

Throughout all of their relegation matches, rivaling the best of the NA teams. However, they are unable to maintain this level of play. Though TS shows higher upside, DIG's superior consistency makes them a much better team, and allowed them to win the relegation series comfortably. Still, TS shows great promise, and with more consistency,,False,t3_1ej4na

**For ADCs**:

* The standard page that almost everyone recommends: AD quints, mr or mr/lvl glyphs

This gives you +15 AD, I feel that this is antiquated. In Season 3, ADCs start with doran blade or long sword 2 pots. This item start makes lasthitting easy enough that you don't need the bonus ad. I only recommend the +15 AD page if you plan on being aggressive and trade a lot pre 6.

* Alternative #1: AD quints, mr or mr/lvl glyphs

Flat armor penetration is stronger in season 3 and scales much better into the mid game. I still keep the AD quints because 1. they're very cost effective 2. you can still trade early game.  I find AD quints

* Alternative #2: armor pen quints, mr or mr/lvl glyphs

This page is good for ADCs that scale well with attack speed. Certain champions don't need much early game bonus AD, and Vayne. This page is bad for champions that use AD scaling abilities however.

* Alternative #3: lifesteal quints, mr or mr/lvl glyphs

This page is for champions that just want to sustain and farm. Kogmaw


**AP carries**:

* the standard: AP quints, ap/lvl glyphs

This page is also antiquated in my opinion. It's made for long range burst mages that have fallen out of flavor. The lack of magic resist makes laning and trading very difficult in the current meta.  Only recommended if you have a super easy lane opponent.

* Alternative #1: AP quints, MR glyphs

The page is basically the same as the one above

* Alternative #2: AP quints, ap/lvl glyphs

Many people are running AD casters mid. You will want to run armor seals vs them. 

* Alternative #3: MS quints, MR glyphs

I use this page for melee mages that are easily harassed by both autos and spells. The +4.5% movespeed helps with roaming as well. This page is also great for aggressive supports.



**Support page**: gp10 quints, MR glyphs

I use this for pretty much every ranged support. gp10s on supports are great



**Jungle page #1**: AD quints, mr/lvl glyphs

This is purely optimized for clear speed for auto attacking junglers. Several junglers have abilities that scale with attackspeed as well.



**Jungle page #2**: lifesteal quints, mr or mr/lvl glyphs

This is the same lifesteal page from the ADC section. Lifesteal quints make jungling incredibly safe and can easily sustain you to 100% hp with the machete 5 pot start. This page also makes you a bigger threat in a early gank or invade before your first recall.


I hope this write up gives you some ideas for how to optimize your rune pages for Season 3. Again

Abilities are from the [wiki page](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Aatrox)

Passive:  Blood Well
Cooldown: 225
&gt;Whenever Aatrox uses an ability that costs health

&gt;Upon taking fatal damage

&gt;Also

Thoughts:

* Theme: The resurrection aspect of the passive certainly fits with the idea that Aatrox wins fights against the odds even though he dies. This synergizes well with the idea that expending his life force makes him fight harder.

* Flow:  The AS boost combines well with his kit which emphasizes dueling and combines with blood thirst to make him deceptively tanky at low amounts of health.  This also encourages him to build Ad in order to make use of the bonus AS.  The resurrect passive also helps make certain build path more appealing and emphasizes building damage and defensive stats as opposed to health

* Balance: The value of the resurrect passive can only be compared to GA.  The GA passive restores 30% of max health which means that at about 3797 hp an equal amount of health is restored assuming a full bar.  Additionally
Additionally his passive grants between 0 and 50% attack speed.  Attack speed is worth between 30 and 33 gold per point and thus
Summary:  Overall his passive is very strong and provides an enormous amount of value (up to 2650)

Q: Dark Flight Range: 650  Cooldown: 16 / 15 / 14 / 13 / 12  Cost: 10% of current health

Thoughts:

* Theme:  Works fine with the super warrior archetype that Aatrox is a part of.  In my opinion, but leaves it lacking any real reason why Aatrox has this and not some other champ.

* Flow:  This ability is clearly designed to allow Aatrox a hard engage and to prevent him from being constantly kited.  The choice to have it cost 10% current hp although counter-intuitive serves a dual purpose.  When hard engaging with this ability from full health

* Balance:  The obvious comparison to make is with Malphites ultimate, lacks a stun on top of the knockup, and has a much smaller aoe that is knocked up.  The real difference is simply the role that the two play and that malphites ability has much more potential becuase of his kit.

W: Blood Thirst/ Blood Price Cooldown: .5  Cost:N/A

&gt;Toggle off: Aatrox heals himself on every third attack. If Aatrox is below 50% health he will heal for three times as much. 

&gt;Heal: 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 (+25% bonus AD) 

&gt;Enhanced heal: 60 / 75 / 90 / 105 / 120 (+75% bonus AD)

&gt;Toggle on: Aatrox deals bonus physical damage on every third attack at the cost of health.

&gt;Bonus physical damage: 60 / 95 / 130 / 165 / 200 (+100% bonus AD)

&gt;Health cost on third attack: 15 / 23.75 / 32.5 / 41.25 / 50 (+25% bonus AD)

The core mechanic of Aatrox's kit and arguably the most interesting mechanic, while providing limited and controlled sustain in the lane or the jungle.

Thoughts:
* Theme:  A core mechanic that reflects the central idea of using his own vitality to bolster his attacks until he seems like he is about to be defeated at which point the triple healing kicks in.  A well thought out skill in terms of fitting in with the champ lore

* Flow:  This is the area where this skill shines.  The skill is designed to allow Aatrox to do high bonus damage while helping him more speedily reach 50% during fights

* Balance:  Balance wise this skill shouldn't ever be a major problem simply because it is very easy to adjust numbers in order to change how much of an impact this skill has.  As far as I know, his bons 66 damadge on hit is well above most ad bruisers and only outdone by Taric, Poppy, Yi, Gragas, Mundo, and Alistar.  Some interesting side effects of the self imposed damage is that with 25% lifesteal this ability has no cost against an enemy with no armor and that this ability damages Aatrox more against an enemy with 300 armor or more.

E: Blades of Torment Range: 1000 Cooldown: 12 / 11 / 10 / 9 / 8  Cost: 5% of current health

&gt;ACTIVE: Deals magic damage to enemies in a line and slowing them by 40% for a few seconds.


&gt;MAGIC DAMAGE: 75 / 120 / 165 / 210 / 255 (+ 60% AP) (+ 60% bonus AD)


&gt;SLOW DURATION: 1.75 / 2 / 2.25 / 2.5 / 2.75

Thoughts:

* Theme:  This ability has more or less no correlation with what Aatrox is supposed to be and appears to be an ability that was added to provided needed cc in a new targeting shape.

* Flow: Because the slow length scales as opposed to the slow percentage, as opposed to targets that are farther away and running.

* Balance:  This skill also doesn’t seem to have any major balances issues or reasons for special attention when balancing since it is a generic aoe slow with decent AP and AD scaling.  If the skill is found to be too weak or strong

R: Massacre Cooldown: 100 / 85 / 70

&gt;Active: For the next 12 seconds

&gt;MAGIC DAMAGE: 200 / 300 / 400 (+ 100% AP) ATTACK SPEED: 40 / 50 / 60%
Thoughts:

* Theme:  Although bland

* Flow:  Again this ability flows fairly well

* Balance A fairly straightforward ult like this shouldn’t be hard to balance, because it helps temporarily fill in a weakness, but it doesn’t feel nearly as fun as something as powerful should.  Additionally, the 1:1 ap ratio is ridiculous and seems like a newb trap since playing him as Ap is clearly extremely subpar.  I question why Riot chose to add this.  Other than that, magic damage is a good choice since it scales better into late game where armor is more common without getting out of control with armor pen stacking.

______________________________________________________________________________________________
**I. Introduction**

Map terrain is a crucial, a team that takes advantage of the map terrain can erase huge deficits, allowing the underdog team to completely turn the game around. One of the most impactful map terrain elements is the choke point.

Choke points occur at any point in which a relatively straight path narrows suddenly. This narrowing restricts side to side movement as teams move through the choke, there were 3 teamfights which were impacted heavily by choke points. In this analysis, we will examine each of these 3 teamfights, analyzing how the chokes dictated team positioning and led to losses for the team that failed to recognize them.

**Team Comps**

**TSM:** **Renekton** (Dyrus), **Caitlyn** (WildTurtle), **Sona** (Xpecial)

**GGU:** **Rumble** (ZionSpartan), **Twitch** (DontMashMe), **Thresh** (Daydreamin)


______________________________________________________________________________________________
**II. Teamfight 1: [14:16-14:42]**

**[[IMAGES] Teamfight Breakdown](http://imgur.com/a/ganmZ#0)**

**Analysis:**

There were 2 key positional mistakes TSM was forced into because they chose to initiate through the ledge choke. First, allowing Rumble to land an ult hitting all 3 squishies of TSM. This dealt some damage, but more importantly, it forced Sona to split upwards to get out of the ult. 

Second, the most convenient retreat path for GGU. Thus, their best move was to run through the river to arrive at the fight as soon as possible and cut off the retreat path. This also allowed them to avoid the choke, but it split them from their squishies. 

Thus, she had wasted all her cooldowns on Thresh, so Nocturne was able to ult onto Caitlyn and separate her, which was the biggest determinant of the teamfight.

However, and Diana and Caitlyn had flash and net respectively. What was necessary was for TSM to be cognizant of the choke and be prepared to escape out of it. But clearly, this was not the case; Caitlyn chose to run away from the side of the ledge instead of netting over it, which would be the right course of action if she were not separated in a choke. 

Overall, TSM could have still won the fight, even with the loss of Caitlyn. However, the biggest loss in this teamfight was Caitlyn's death, and the next 2 teamfights are almost entirely dictated by the presence of choke points.

**In Brief: Engaging through the choke forced TSM into split positioning
______________________________________________________________________________________________
**III. Teamfight 2: [20:34-20:52]**

**[[IMAGES] Teamfight Breakdown](http://imgur.com/a/ganmZ#10)**

**Analysis:**

This teamfight perfectly demonstrates the primary disadvantage of moving through choke points: the limited lateral movement leaves players susceptible to skillshot and AOE abilities. Thus, splitting the team and focusing down the initiator freely. This exact scenario happened twice in this teamfight, with each team foolishly engaging through a choke, and dying as a result.

As Thresh first engaged, bursting him and forcing his flash. As Nocturne ulted, GGU was no longer completely zoned since TSM had used some abilities, but they could still only safely focus Cho'gath from a distance. Thus, when Cho'gath was low, he was able to easily flash out of range. Meanwhile, the GGU carries could not follow up with Nocturne, leaving him with no escape even if he flashed. 

As the GGU carries moved forward in the choke, and he was forced to burn his flash before TSM could turn. In contrast, Orianna's ult was easily avoided by most of TSM, hitting only Cho'gath; the zoning limited her ball placement and made it more predictable, and TSM had multple directions to spread out to. 

However, so the initiators, Diana and Sona, were easily focused down within the choke, ending the fight at 2-1 for GGU. All the deaths were a result of the positional disadvantage created by engaging through the choke point.

**In Brief: Poor engages into the choke by both teams allowed the enemy to zone
______________________________________________________________________________________________
**IV. Teamfight 3: [24:53-25:40]**

**[[IMAGES] Teamfight Breakdown](http://imgur.com/a/ganmZ#20)**

**Analysis:**

The area between the wraith brush and lane entrance chokes is an especially hazardous area, when GGU was forced behind the wraith brush, TSM should have had an easy tower, and GGU should have been forced to run all the way around the wall to get to mid lane.

However, as the rest of TSM's AOE threat was not in position. It did not give GGU an opening to initiate, however, since GGU was still grouped up from moving through the choke point. They needed to reposition first, but Nocturne initiated anyway, allowing Renekton and Diana to burst the clumped GGU carries. Meanwhile, with ample room to run, allowing TSM to eventually clean up for an ace.

Once again, GGU got an opening to defend the turret. However, GGU's poor initiation nullified the mistake and created an even better outcome for TSM.

**In Brief: TSM failed to zone GGU at the choke point
______________________________________________________________________________________________
**V. Key Points**

In summary

* **Susceptibility to AOE and Skillshots** - The restricted movement caused teams to clump and move more predictably, Cho'gath stuns and many other abilities to land on multiple important targets. 

* **Zoning** - In teamfight 2, the rest of the team could not follow up properly. 

* **Split Positioning** - Even without zoning by the enemy team, it would take too long to follow up. Thus, they split from the team to cut off the mid lane retreat, but left Caitlyn defenseless in the process.

______________________________________________________________________________________________
**VI. Final Thoughts**

Failing to account for choke points is one of the most common teamfighting mistakes in competitive League of Legends. Most teams seem to have some innate understanding of the effects of map terrain, but are not always actively thinking about it, so huge choke point disadvantages are often overlooked for trivial reasons.

This is one of the biggest areas of improvement for any team. Those that work to be consistently and actively aware of choke points and other map terrain features will improve their teamfighting and overall play greatly.",,t5_2wenn,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1dniao/indepth_analysis_choke_point_play_analyzing_the/
1367603229.0,1dmq90,"Delving into the versatility, niches, and potential of Tryndamere. (Also, the State of Melee ADC's)",iPandaN,5


Hey guys

_________________________________________________


**The State of Melee ADC's:**


This is a discussion we've all had or read so many times, Yi is a Melee ADC/Resetting Assassin hybrid, an Fiora is a AD Caster that transitions into an ADC/AD Caster hybrid late game.


The classic statements are that Melee ADC's are susceptible to CC and Kiting, and doesn't really have any basis (Because all of the Melee ADC's function very differently.)

_________________________________________________


**Tryndamere's different niches:**


The first niche is the one aforementioned, it is not true that picking an obscene amount of CC will counter a Tryndamere pick. It just counters this one niche, and not Tryndamere.

Tryndamere's second niche, and he's phenomenal at it. I can't tell you how many games I've won where applying pressure as Tryndamere via splitpushing was a major contribution to the win. This is an optional niche you can fill if they pick champs with large amounts of CC.

The third niche Tryndamere can fill is still a melee ADC role


-**If you get focused**, and top), as you're not within range of their support and you're not diving the enemy ADC (who doesn't prioritize focus to start with). Any enemy AP that is going to dive your backline, will be a burst champion, and not a DPS champion, because the only AP DPS champion (Karthus, Ziggs, Cassiopeia) do not dive the backline (Well maybe suicide Karthus). Any DPS champion diving your backline will be AD, keep fighting as if they keep focusing you to keep you at 1 hp, then just ult when they burst you and they will have no cooldowns. Lifesteal back up and stay because they have no DPS to keep you from heal tanking. If they commit some combination of DPS/Burst then it still greatly benefits your team to have 1-2 of their burst champions' abilities on cooldown. 


**Short Version:** Whoever is diving you in the backline is going to die to the damage from your Ranged ADC and Yourself. GOOD scenario.


-**If they understand that focusing Tryndamere is like focusing Karthus, they just blew all their cooldowns.) and slow them with your W once they run past you to get to your ranged ADC, and BoRK active whichever champion it will peel the most (Not really peel the most per se, but use the BoRK active on whichever champion that using it reduces the most damage your ranged ADC would take  otherwise). If they only commit 1-2 champions to diving, you should be able to burn through their HP bars insanely fast especially if they are off-tanks. If they commit 3, well then their support and ADC will get killed or zoned out of the fight by your mid and top,  who then will return to ruin the 3 divers' day by forcing a localized 5v3 (Or a 5v2 if everything's gone well and you've already killed one of the divers).


**Short Version:** It can go either way, but it could happen with a right mixture of champions), then your combined DPS will win out very quickly. Usually a GOOD scenario.


-**If They are running a Protect the ""X"" strat and not diving, you will be able to eat through their teams HP faster than their carry will eat through yours. It's really situational here, but either focus whoever your ADC is focusing, focus their ADC (Forcing their team to blow CC on you), or focus whoever has the Aegis/FH/etc on their team. I'll admit I haven't dealt with this scenario as it's not very popular in S3, and even more rare in soloq.


**Bad Scenarios/Complications:** 

-Fed Poppy.
-Teams with multiple Attack speed debuffs (I.e. Nasus, etc.)
-Teams with strong single target suppress (I.e. A malzahar that can ulti you right before your ulti wears off etc.)
-Multiple high burst abilities that you have to keep track of (I.e. Cho'Gath's and Veigar) which makes timing your ultimate difficult


---------------------------------------------------------------

**Conclusion:** I'd really like to hear what you guys think about some of the things I've pointed out. I didn't have very long to post this but I love replies,  anything I forgot to take into account, or further analyze and discuss the idea of peeling with Tryndamere.",,False,,t5_2wenn,,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1dmq90/delving_into_the_versatility_niches_and_potential/

1369989337.0,1fe717,Olympus Champions Spring 2013 - Semifinal Preview - CJ Entus Blaze vs CJ Entus Frost,manisier,31,7,12,"Hi /r/summoners, I wasn't going to write this but I decided to at the last minute since there was some stuff about Frost I wanted to write about and couldn't find any other outlet for.

**CJ Entus Blaze vs CJ Entus Frost**

*Overview*

It just wouldn't be a Champions playoffs without Blaze and Frost clashing in a best of 5. MiG Blaze humiliated MiG Frost in a shutout in the first iteration of Champions (coincidentally, and that Frost has the best chance of beating Blaze. In some aspects, this is true - each team knows the playstyle of the other like their own. Hours upon hours of practice, each team bouncing strategies and compositions off each other culminate in some of the best games of League of Legends ever witnessed when Blaze and Frost collide.

The two teams have performed extraordinarily well in Champions Spring so far. Blaze came into the tournament with a lot of skepticism surrounding them, as his rapid improvement led many to consider him the best top laner in Korea, if not the world. Off the back of Flame and Blaze's other solo laner Ambition, the CJ Entus side has wowed fans and dispelled all doubts existing in the minds of critics. Blaze destroyed Reapered's SK Telecom T1 #1 in three games in the quarterfinal, and are coming into this game with an air of confidence.

Frost are no strangers to finals pressure. True to form, Frost will have received their worst Champions result in history, as they have made it to the grand final of every tournament thus far. The consistency of solo laners Shy and RapidStar has taken them to the round of 4, dispatching of last season's winners Najin Sword in the quarterfinal - the very team that took three games in a row against them in the grand final.

*Flame On - Top Lane*

In my previous article, Flame and Shy are in top form, made especially significant as Shy was the one who taught Flame the ins and outs of playing top lane in the Korean competitive scene. Student challenges master as the two top laner juggernauts come head-to-head tonight.

Flame, the Blaze top laner is currently leading the Sonokong MVP rankings, with 700 points, 50 points ahead of the now eliminated Faker, and MVP Ozone's support Mata who Flame will face if Blaze wins this semifinal. Flame is the core player of Blaze's split-pushing strategy, employing a unique style without the use of champions with teleports such as Shen or even champions with strong escapes like Nidalee. Rather, he favours champions such as Kennen, Kha'zix and even a new concoction in Ryze. All of these champions are able to dominate in one-on-one duels, due to Blaze's frequent employment of lane swaps.

Shy returns from Shanghai as a Korean hero, also being the core player of Frost's strategy. Despite their similarities, Shy's role in Frost's broader game plan is much different. His Jayce is a core component of Frost's poke compositions, while his Kennen and Rumble are central to their AOE compositions. Like Flame, his Ryze is also deadly, though he prefers to run the mage in the middle lane while RapidStar takes a side lane. Ultimately, a head-to-head between Shy and Flame will come down to the champions which they pick. Currently, with Kha'zix

Both Flame and Shy are extraordinary players, their teams) down. With this in mind, the outcome of their match-up will be decided by who can overcome resistance the best and perform their role.

*On Cloud Nine - Jungle*

Once upon a time, the exemplar 'herbivore' jungler, defaulted to a support role, initiating fights and protecting his carries. With the season 3 jungle, however, both players have gravitated towards a more holistic jungle style, focusing on taking early objectives rather than favouring ganks or farm. 

Helios has had to deal with mounds of criticism, Helios has picked up an old favourite of his, Lee Sin, occasionally looking to Nasus as an option. His versatile, bruiser-oriented playstyle has been a factor in Blaze's recent success, where he has functioned as an 'enabler' for Blaze's superstar solo lanes. Slightly more aggressive than his Frost counterpart, Helios will continue to select more aggressive, or possibly his old flame (pun definitely intended) Nocturne. 

CloudTemplar has surprised many this season with his move towards a more aggressive playstyle. The herbivore jungler is often seen with Hermes and MadLife, picking up Elise and Rammus as more aggressive ganking junglers alongside the old herbivore standards Nasus and Shen. However, if he does not pick a ganking jungler, CloudTemplar cannot be expected to have too much of an impact on the game early. 

The match-up between the two CJ Entus junglers is the opposite of the match-up between bengi and DanDy that we witnessed on Wednesday. Both players do not want too much trouble from the other

*Grand Final Ambitions - Mid Lane* 

Blaze's All-Star **Ambition** and Frost veteran **RapidStar** present an equally weighted match-up, due to both players being fairly passive mid laners, opting to farm and help their teams with objectives rather than try for kills. As such, both Ambition and RapidStar should enjoy a greater degree of freedom and influence on the game as they come up against a similarly passive opponent.

While Frost's Shy went to Shanghai to take home a Korean victory, he selected Kennen as a surprise pick, as well as one of his favourite champions Kha'zix. Unfortunately for Blaze fans, Ambition will not be allowed to pick Twisted Fate, as Frost will not want to give away free games. The likelihood of another surprise pick coming out of Ambition is quite low, but the possiblility should not be discounted.

RapidStar has lived in Ambition's shadow in recent days, but Blaze must be more frightened of his breathtaking Diana, showcased in his destruction of Najin Sword's SSONG in the quarterfinal. Kha'zix, Jayce and Ryze remain favourite picks for RapidStar, and the possibility of the mid Nocturne which he enjoys cannot be discounted, either. Expect RapidStar to pick for Frost's composition, rather than to beat Ambition out.

There is a lot of subtext beneath this otherwise standard mid lane match-up. Ambition is seeking to utilise his All-Star experience and to remind Korea why they deemed him the mid laner of choice. RapidStar does not want to be considered beneath Ambition in terms of skill

*God on His Throne - Bot Lane*

Perhaps the most lopsided comparison that could be made between Blaze and Frost is that of their respective bot lanes **Captain Jack** and **Lustboy** against **Hermes** and **MadLife**. The Blaze bottom lane has fell from grace, Hermes and MadLife are considered one of the best, mostly due to the influence of All-Star MadLife, who has proven himself the world's greatest support, if not the world's greatest player. 

Captain Jack and Lustboy have a lot to prove in this match. It is likely that Blaze will elect to send them against Shy, as his abilities on hypercarries Kog'Maw and Tristana should shine as he comes up against a team that seeks to engage in teamfights rather than split push. Lustboy's synergy with Captain Jack is impressive in teamfights and skirmishes, though his questionable laning decisions lead the Blaze bot lane to give up deaths early. His favourite support Lulu should make an appearance, though his Sona is not out of the question either.

Hermes makes his first semifinal appearance on the side of Frost, opting for teamfight-oriented carries like Miss Fortune and Varus. The attention is certainly not on Hermes when Frost plays, as he is expected to put out damage to allow Shy and RapidStar to clean up. MadLife is the factor that ties Frost together, with near-impossible plays on Thresh and Blitzcrank creating opportunities for his team to push advantages. Certainly, the performance of MadLife will be a huge factor in Frost's ability to pull out a win against Blaze.

It is extremely unlikely that Blaze will send their bottom lane against Frost's

*CJ Entus Blaze must*:

* **Allow Flame to carry**. Due to the disparity between  their bottom lane and Frost's
* **Play a fast-paced game**. Laning aggression and early objectives have been the key factors in their ten-game winning streak
* **Prey on Frost's predictability**. The reason Frost have always made the grand final isn't innovation

*CJ Entus Frost must:*

* **Limit Flame's opportunities**. Though Flame deserves his reputation as Korea's scariest top laner
* **Stress their teamfight dominance**. Frost look to be near-unbeatable when playing in their comfort zone
* **Take early games**. If Frost can come out of the gates with a surprise

*Predictions*

I see two alternative outcomes for this match, if Frost claim early games, they are at liberty to drop games and extract information about Blaze's game plan to claim a blind pick victory.

1362475095.0,19p65r,With the current popularity of BotRK...,t0b145,33,11,49,"...will we see the return of support Nunu?  

Support Nunu  hasn't seen much play, and I think that with the current popularity of Blade of the Ruined King, support Nunu might be able to make a comeback.  

**Why?**  
Because support Nunu still gives a massive amount (45% with maxed Blood Boil) of attack speed, Absolute Zero. I don't think Nunu will be able to reach his former dominance again, for reasons stated below, but I think that, especially when paired to either a late game hypercarry (Tristana, Kog'Maw, Vayne) or an early game attackspeed-based carry such as Caitlyn or Varus

**Why not?**  
Because support Nunu will still be not as good in some areas as a lot of other supports. Compared to Taric and Sona, hard CC and significant defensive steroids (no aura's like Taric's Shatter or Sona's Aria of Perseverance). Nunu has obviously been nerfed, and that took away some of the dominance he could show in the past, but I think he is still very strong. The main reason he might not become popular again, is because other supports (Taric and Thresh, I'm looking at you...) are simply too strong right now.  

**TL;DR:** With the new BotRK, Nunu might not become a good pick because supports such as Taric are simply too strong.

1374924685.0,1j5mkf,What does the lack of international tournaments in Season 3 mean for the competitive scene?,BirdboyDom,25,1,9,"Seasons 1 and 2 (predominantly 2) were played through a series of international tournaments every one or two months - IPLs, it has pushed out any room for international tournaments. With the teams having to practice for meaningful games every week and travelling to the venue and back

What this means for the competitive scene is that there is *one* big international tournament per year. World Finals. That's personally what I've missed most about the previous seasons. It's frustrating having absolutely no way to compare the different regions until Worlds, WE vs CLG, M5 vs TPA, etc.

I think it would be great to see these big

How I think it would work best is taking a mid-season LCS week and replacing it with one of these tournaments. The problems with this though would be organizing it alongside LPL and OGN and also the fact that it would make the split a week longer.

But my main question is what do you think this lack of international competition means for competitive League? Does it stifle progress? Does it make Worlds a better, etc.? Will teams take them seriously?",,False,,t5_2wenn,False,eg,

**LoL Arena is a league-based tournament that gives you a month to get used to the players on your team and compete against others. You register as a player and enter the pool of draftable players. Your performance in Scouting Lobbies will greatly impact your draft stock. After the draft

We are fielding 12 teams and are looking for two more owners. Each team will draft 6-7 players(TBD based on number of sign ups) so only roughly 84-96 will be drafted. The rest have the option of entering free agency. Not being drafted is not the end of the world because eFlux is a great community. We usually run community games on a daily basis and allow for other opportunities for competition within the community. Our website is brand new and we are not yet utilizing the new forums. They will be for only social purposes within the community

Anyway

**Step 1: Fill out the sign up sheet on the home page.**

**Step 2: Check the calendar for Scouting Lobbies. You must play in at least one.**

**Step 3: The draft will occur and you will be informed if you are drafted.**

**Step 4: Practice and play with your team and fight for the gold!**

*You can read more in-depth about eFlux Gaming's LoL Arena and sign up here at our main website:* http://efluxgaming.com/

What do you guys think of Quinn? Builds? Strategies?
I've played 4 or 5 games as an ADC and I just can't play her well as a normal ADC. Even if she picks up a few kills early on I feel like she can't carry as hard as most of the other ADCs because of her kit.

However building her like a tanky-DPS top laner has seemed to work a little better.

I've been starting Doran's Blade, then going for a BT. I've yet to try BotRK, but it seems like it could be a good item for her.

I feel like she has a lot of potential but I still can't really figure her out. Her ult seems like it should be used as a chasing/movement tool instead of some kind of team fight execution move. Her W seems really useful. Her Q is really good but her E is kind of strange and I can't really seem to figure out when it's a good time to use it. I usually end up maxing Q first but I don't know if her W or E is better to start maxing next: the E's increased damage seems helpful in top lane trades while the W passive seems really good too.

1361988902.0,19c90a,Just in time for Super Week! NA LCS Player Statistics,RRCountMoriarty,27,5,5,"Hey

**Gold/Min**

I'm interested in knowing what you think the best statistical gauge of individual player skill is be it KDA

* Top Lane: Voyboy
* Jungler: SaintVicious
* Mid Lane: Reginald
* ADC: Imaqtpie
* Support: Elementz

Unsurprisingly the undefeated Curse is on top of a majority of the positions.  Somewhat humorously

**Champion Pool**

Just as in the EU, so players who've played more should be given some extra consideration.  Win/Losses should be considered last as a loss might indicate a given champion is not really in a player's pool, or but there are many other factors in a loss.   

**Wide Champion Pools**

* In a completely opposite trend from the EU LCS the ADCs in NA have shown a wider champion pool than other positions.  MRN's Heartbeat has played 4 champions across 4 games. The formidable ADCs Doublelift and Cop have both played 5 different carries in 6 games
* In a statistic that will probably shock just about nobody

* GGU has a couple of members topping the variety poll.  Fat has never played the same champion twice across 5 games.  Nintendude has played 6 different junglers in 7 games and Zionspartan has played 6 champions in his 7 games across two roles.  GGU has certainly show a willingness to try many champions

**Small Champion Pools**

* Dignitas' Patoy has the smallest champion pool.  However
* 10 Summoners are just about tied for the next smallest Champion Pool. Most of them are Junglers (4) and Supports (3)

**NA Player Awards**

* Serial Killer (Highest kills in a single game) Doublelift's Ezreal 12
* Undying (most zero death games) Cop, Zuna 3
* Best Friend (most assist in a single game) M eye A's Taric 21
* Skumbag Award (most kills in a single game by a support player) Bloodwater's Leona 3

I would love to get more ideas for these player awards so let me know if you come up with a good one.  Keep in mind I'm trying to save awards that call for totals (such as Highest Total Kills) until the season ends. 

**Other Stuff**

* Dignitas has the 2 fastest wins in NA.  25:17 against TSM and 25:32 against MRN
* TSM's win over Dignitas was the 4 fastest win in the NA LCS
* Slowest win came from Curse 48:31 over GGU
* Average game length is 35:55
* NA has fewer strats for red side than EU. The current record is Blue 16 Red 8. (EU splits 13-11)
* The most obvious “victims” of repeated target banning are Scara and Reginald. Their Gragas and Leblanc get banned frequently against them

Part 2 examines the second game of the series. Read [Part 1 here](http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1e467n/dignitas_teamfighting_analysis_part_1/).
___
###I. Teamfight 4 [7:23-7:53]

**Analysis:**

###[[Images]Teamfight Breakdown &amp; Analysis](http://imgur.com/a/whKjd#0)

**Key Factors:**

* **DIG properly focused down Ryze

___
###II. Teamfight 5 [16:44-17:10]

**Analysis:**

###[[Images]Teamfight Breakdown &amp; Analysis](http://imgur.com/a/Luc4v#0)

This teamfight was decided by the team comps rather than any big mistakes. It ended with no deaths

**Key Factors:**

* **DIG used their team comp advantage well.** With low range and AOE in the GGU comp

* **DIG properly punished GGU's split positioning.** By chasing Kha'zix back to further separate GGU and then suddenly turning

* **DIG retreated at the right time.** Though DIG had blown Tristana's summoners

___
###III. Teamfight 6 [33:48-34:05]

**Analysis:**

###[[Images]Teamfight Breakdown &amp; Analysis](http://imgur.com/a/ijbfI#0)


**Key Factors:**

* **DIG's superior AOE punished GGU's engage.** The AOE damaged Ryze and his ghost simultaneously

* **Zyra landed her root onto Yorick as well as Ryze.** Though it was mostly luck

___
###IV. Conclusions From Game 2

Unfortunately, uninteresting mistakes by GGU. The second teamfight was well executed by DIG, punishing GGU once they saw the split, and also knowing when to retreat for better opportunities.
___
###V. Conclusions From Games 1 and 2

In stark contrast to the teamfights from game 1, then, is why DIG was able to execute these concepts well in teamfight 5, but not in the previous game. Though it's impossible to know for sure, there were several factors that potentially made the proper decisions much clearer to DIG in teamfight 5 over the previous fights:

1. **DIG was naturally set up to execute choke point control.** In teamfight 5, instead of having to actively enforce it like in teamfight 1.

2. **DIG only needed 1 tank line and it was much more obvious where to place it.** It was clear that GGU's main threat was in the 4 man split so DIG formed a strong tank line against the flank

3. **There was no hard engagement**. In the fights from the previous game, there was no initial target for tem to zone in on.

4. **No GGU members were overly weak.** Similar to the previous point

5. **The disengage was much more decisive.** The Zyra ult created forced GGU straight back and created a much larger gap between DIG and GGU in teamfight 5 than those in teamfights 2 and 3

In summary, it could also have been a matter of chance, with either game being a fluke, or something else. Whatever the reason, DIG showed markedly better teamfight play in this game than the previous one, and showed they are capable of executing the concepts they failed to in game 1.

There were 2 other potential flags

1. **In teamfight 5, but was this matter realized by DIG or would they have done the same even if GGU had strong AOE? From my knowledge of DIG, I would tend to give them the benefit of the doubt in this situation, but it is still something to watch for.

2. **A bigger flag, it fits in with a larger theme from game 1 in which Scarra was continually caught out of position.

*

We end part 2 with a more balanced perspective of DIG, and there were factors that naturally made it easier to realize the proper moves, which could potentially be the reason for DIG's better play in this game rather than a better active approach from DIG. We will continue to round our perspective on these matters as we examine the teamfights in the final game of the series in Part 3.",,False,,t5_2wenn,,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1e4zmb/dignitas_teamfighting_analysis_part_2/

We recently got to see a lot of threads dealing with the new Blade of the Ruined King as it looks like it will become a dominant item for AD carries to build so  as a first topic

Coming into season 3

---------------

A quick reminder:

**Recipe:** *Recurve Bow* (950 G) + 2x *Dagger* (400 G) + Recipe (1000 G) = Total cost of 2750 G

**Stats:** +70% Attack Speed

**Unique Passive:**  Your basic attacks fire minor bolts at 2 nearby targets *(300 range

See [LoL Wiki](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Runaan's_Hurricane) for a list of on hit effects/spells/items that can/cannot work with this item.

---------------

A few questions to help you get started:

What do you think of this item (building path, passive, counterparts, good champions to build it with)? 

Were you excited when it got released ? Were you disappointed or did you foresee its lack ? 

Do you use it in serious games ? Would you like to see it tweaked and how ?

1361888611.0,199cm0,My thoughts on the current meta with regards to the AD role and some small predictions - Would love to hear your thoughts,zoleirl,26,4,35,"This thread stems from the thinking I got to after reading this [excellent post about Quinn and BotRK](http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/198b2s/a_somewhat_indepth_look_on_quinn_new_botrk_and/)

I think that this next patch will start a swing which will change the adc meta. 

After a few people have gone about building BRK, for a more clear breakdown as to why it's good, check the above linked thread). 

But the [comments that Doublelift made last week](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CEAQtwIwAg&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Fleague-of-legends%2Fvideos%2Fknow-your-role-ad-carry-with-doublelift-lcs-week-3-6404372%2F&amp;ei=17ksUbLwL5HkmAXnlYGYDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNHWOMwVP9G1S4FeIobMZ2NBO4ZxrA&amp;bvm=bv.42965579

And that's fine

Current meta up until a few months ago (and definitely the CLG playstyle) had been to get the AD farmed and let them carry by doing big damage to everyone. 

And then bruisers started to become more dominant. It wasn't enabled by the black cleaver changes, right? 

And then I read the post about Quinn and BRK

I think that this ""tanky"" build is the natural evolution of ADC to combat not only the bruiser meta

**Why?**

Most people insist on building their carries glass cannon. At the most they get a warmog, if you break the norm you are feeding, trolling, etc. But in actuality, teams don't **need** ranged AD carries. They need **damage** to win team fights. A glass cannon carry who gets dived and can't escape will die quickly or will be totally zoned, and do little to influence the fight. 

But a carry like he lined out? IE, but still with damage output.

""Ah but it's not as much damage.""

Correct. Glass cannon will always do more end game damage. But thats assuming you stay alive in team fights (you won't, Vi's etc on the team). Don't forget that the point is to have damage in the fight, not to play standard. 


**What I'd like to see**

A change in people's mindset. More flexibility in the AD role. 

""Top lane, AD carry, Support"". This is how Riot defines the current roles on a team (and it's laid out as such on their lolesports site). 

I'd say that the most flexible players are the ones who play top. They play all types of characters. Tanks, assassins, split pushers... the list goes on. Sometimes they play in the bottom lane but as the role that is taken on by the top player is a special one (you are isolated from your team, this is true whether you are at top or bottom, as long as you are alone and away from the bulk of your team). 

What was AP mid is now just ""Mid"". J4 mid? Sure

The jungle is always changing. People fall in and out of favour for no real reason , i think), as has building locket of the iron solari. Before Diamondprox built that locket, I don't think I had seen one in game for months. Now it is almost a given you will see it in a pro game. nothing much changed about the item (i believe), it's just that one person did it, people saw it was good and suddenly it's the norm. Same thing for Hecarim. Now he is considered  great jungler, but with nothing really changing for him. Lee Sin, is suddenly not as popular. No big changes to him recently

But AD? Not much changing. One example is Doublelift (and let me take this opportunity to say that I think he is an amazing player

So what? It's been working very well for Cop in the LCS, but whatever works. 

Emphasis on the word **works**. The job is not to be impressive, this is a very real, very high pressure job.

I think that AD players are currently the least versatile. Top and mid play a mix of all characters, Taric, Leona and Alistar, for example, all play very differently). They have it fixed in their mind that they must play the same type of characters each game. 

**Predictions** 

*More lane switches

I'm not talking about top/bottom, all things being equal in terms of wave clear, mid tower will drop faster, as it's the shorter lane. 

The advantage in this swap is that IF you can win your lane or get a few kills early on

*Tankier AD carries

With an item build similar to the one laid out in the Quinn/BRK post (BRK, Randuins) an AD would have not only good duelling power against another AD but a huge health boost for teamfights, well as the ability to escape using Randuin active + the proc from auto attacks on randuins. Less glass cannons.

*Solo ad carries mid lane

This one is the biggest change. It might not happen, with (it seems to me) most warding and map awareness coming from their support player. But it's my thinking that an AD carry mid lane can function fine (it was common when I started playing), and a typical AP character (which often have their own CC) in combination with a support (also often having their own CC) would be an incredibly effective bot lane. 


**OK So if this is such a good idea

It didn't need to be. The meta develops to combat the previous meta. This is a constantly changing cycle. When AD's were the best for consistent damage

But currently


I love the idea of this new subreddit

TL;DR: 

No TL;DR!

        [R] - Mercury Cannon -  No longer has an armor and magic resist reducing proc.
  
Riot's explanation for changes:

 Shifting around his statistics to favor mana regeneration as Jayce should be more of an active laner focused around spells to achieve victory. The shift in regeneration should also compensate for the removal of Mana on Hit from Static Field.

To the Skies! had some early game spike power and late game spike power. Normalizing this curve such that you don't have to stack a ton of early Attack Damage or a ton of late Penetration in order to utilize this ability effectively for burst.

Static Field should encourage Jayce to stay in Hammer form and engage on his opponents for prolonged periods of time while his Cannon Transform is unavailable.

Also experimenting with a W -&gt; R -&gt; W swap combo - though the current gameplay is a little unintuitive.

Thundering Blow in top lane was often Jayce's easy-mode button. If Jayce was in a bad spot - he could simply Thundering Blow to escape. Aggressively gating the Mana Cost on this ability means that eventually

However

Changes on Shock Blast are mostly to increase the dodgability of it

The acceleration of gate also favors using E after launching Q - as this will give the opponent the smallest amount of time to react.

Hyper Charge harass becomes more dominating depending on the rank of the spell in a lot of cases. Early ranks of Hyper Charge tend to be less than mana efficient in a lot of ways. These changes are designed to reduce some of obtuse abuse cases of Hyper Charge with IE or priming the skill but to also make Hyper Charge's cost roughly equivalent to its effect.

Jayce brings Acceleration Gate as his primary team utility. The Jayce player should feel confident that his team contribution shouldn't be necessarily gated by his playstyle or what he is forced to build. The cooldown nerfs in 3.9 should control Gate''s spamminess and uptime - and thus the Mana Cost here seems to be unnecessarily restricting him to Mana intensive builds.

This proc effect (on Mercury Cannon) was mostly unnecessary - while it ensured Jayce made it to late game

My opinion on the Olaf changes are that they're a bit much. I get that Olaf hasn't been seen in awhile and that he has one of the lowest win rates in solo queue but people seem to forget how strong he used to be and the problems with him.

People like to point to the fact that the 1v2 with Voyboy was the reason he got nerfed but if you watched some of the old matches from OGN, his ult and ghost he could run at your carry and there was no way to stop him save exhaust which simply reduced the damage he was able to deal out. People like to say ""just kite him"" but he cannot get slowed or knocked back during his ult and the only champion I know who can kite him well enough is Vayne and if you need to pick exactly one champ to deal with another, I think that's pretty problematic.

Last week's Power Ranking above. 


Welcome to another week of the CN LPL power ranking. Remember this power ranking representing the current performance of each team in the league


**Rank 1 (+): Invictus Gaming / 14W3L / 1st**

IG remain at the top of the table with another perfect 3 0 week, NGF Qualifier against OMG, and a super weekend in LPL against Royal/We/OMG. 

*Highlighted Player: Xiaoxiao / Support:*

Had a good performance over the past one week

**Rank 2 (+2): Team OMG / 12W5L / 3rd**

3 0 perfect week, OMG continue to show why they had the expectation from the Chinese fans to be the 3rd Giant of China. No obvious weakness in the lineup and unbelievably stable, it will be no shocking if OMG will be one of the team qualify to the S3 world finals. 

*Highlighted Player: Gogoing / Top*

Gogoing is having a great time

**Rank 3 (+2): Royal.HZ / 10W7L / 5th**

Still at the 5th

*Highlighted Player: GoDlike / Top*

Godlike is the best Renekton in the world

**Rank 4 (-2): Team WE / 12W5L / 2nd**

Bo1 is hard for WE, and another 1 2 finish this week drew more attention on their ability to play in BO 1 format, which is potentially the World final group stage format. Despite heavy favour to be the Number 1 seed of the region and qualify to the quarter final directly in the Worlds, the current status in LPL may turn out it could be other possibilities. 

*Highlighted Player: Misaya / mid*

This is the first time highlighting a under-performing player in the power ranking. Misaya's past performance in last 6 LPL match brought alot doubts to his form and a big part affecting WE's overall performance. We will have to see if he can bounce back in the SWL final against IG and the upcoming LPL week 7. 

**Rank 5 (-2): Positive Energy / 11W6L / 4th**

PE achieved a expected weekend with 2 1 finish but still unable to win against either IG/WE. Their strength and weakness both very obvious and it is hard to expect any big turnaround soon unless another roster change. Jing is world class but even though jungle ca change games

*Highlighted Player: NameI (Devil) / ADC*

China has too many world class adc

**Rank 6 (+): Team LM / 5W12L / 6th**

LM is the only team that can put on some challenge against the top 5 team from the bottom 3

**Rank 7 (+): Wayi Spider / 2W15L / 7th**

Not much to talk about a team full of trouble since week 1. Wish them to at least remain 7th at the end of the season for the Pride. 

**Rank 8 (+): Wings of Aurora / 2W15L / 8th**

WOA can beat any team if opponent doesnt know them or unable to adapt quick before 10 minutes mark. But it is harsh to be in China because the top teams adapt quicker than any other region. But their ""first 10 minutes decide game"" strategy could be useful sometimes for other teams. 

**Highlighted Matches:**

Royal vs WE: http://lol.tga.plu.cn/vod/2013-04-20/9685.html

OMG vs Royal: http://lol.tga.plu.cn/vod/2013-04-20/9701.html

OMG vs WE: http://lol.tga.plu.cn/vod/2013-04-21/9720.html

*(All Vods in Chinese and Qualities are not guaranteed)*

**What Happen Next Week:**

This week 7 of Chinese LoL pro scene contain full of great matchs. Starts with the SWL season 2 Grand Final, the LPL weekend will have IG vs Royal/PE vs WE on Friday, IG vs WE/PE vs OMG on Saturday and IG vs OMG on Sunday. Full of great actions all week long.

Often I see this comment (and others related to it) about how you shouldn't play ranked if you can't play every role. I wanted to know how people felt about this

Now, and I will play anything in ARAM and do it well. However...When I play on Summoner's Rift the only role I actually have fun playing is Support. I can ""play"" (understand) other roles, but I don't enjoy them and I don't play them very well partly because of that.

My question to you, but, is it worse to play a role you don't like and not have fun while potentially ruining the game for your team or force yourself into the role you want to play regardless?

The tenacity and CDR makes champs like Graves/Vayne much more comfortable in team fights in my opinion, 20 AD and CDR/Tenacity. PD got nerfed into the ground in my honest opinion, you don't have the IE to back up those crits and the MS is very important in team fights in my opinion to keep some more brittle ADC's safe, meaning they have no large escape (MF/Vayne/Graves).",,False,,False,t3_19khen

**SK Gaming over Evil Geniuses**

Don't worry, since the Bottom 4 teams will have a big day tomorrow.

SK vs. EG. They know each other very well

The Malphite ban by SK was kind of odd, Jarvan ban against SK, and Shen ban against Kev1n were all good ones. Perhaps SK could've banned Lux, but I guess maybe they wanted to face Lux.

First pick Thresh tells you that the bottom lane will be aggressive. Thresh just cannot be a passive support. He has no heals, he is just a CC monster. Pull you, knock you up, get someone on top of you, and slow you down to a crawl. EG must have known that SK was going to run an aggressive comp. MF+Lulu came out from EG, which, as stated before, so the Volibear pick with the potential fling was solid. Varus provides massive CC as well. Against an aggressive CC comp, spoke volumes. Twisted Fate and Rumble... I guess Ocelote was finally tired of getting hit by gold cards and decided to throw some instead. And Equalizer is one heck of an ultimate. So, and ultimates that really hurt. EG's last pick? Lux. Sniping lasers

Akali vs. Rumble is a good lane for Akali, and pretty much, the crowd control of SK was overwhelming. Volibear would go in to fling someone, TF would come in to stun them so that they couldn't help but get flung, Thresh would hook then box everyone, and the equalizers did so much damage. That whole time, the champions were stuck in blight and corruption from Varus. The abilities went so well together, who was just trying to bullet time. Yellowpete was not able to get farmed up enough to hit the threshold that Genja gets on MF where every bullet time does so much damage. Also

SK won against EG simply because SK's composition was built around fighting together, couldn't keep up. 

It was a good win for SK, it is EG. 

Just remember. Twisted Fate's Destiny reveals invisible champions. Kha Zix, Shaco, it doesn't matter. You will be seen.

**Gambit Gaming over Fnatic**

I said in my preview of Week 8 Matches that the only way to defeat Fnatic is to shut down xPeke early. Everyone has known that for a while. Gambit was actually the first team that I've seen in a while to shut down Peke and get Fnatic so down early that they couldn't split push at all.

On paper, and with Volibear, MF, and Lulu guarding the base, Fnatic could hold the middle while sOAZ and xPeke split pushed. What they didn't see coming, however, was Fizz.

Now, along with other casters, pointed out, because of the fact that it was the last pick. And Gambit picked that pick to counter TF specifically. Alex Ich actually said in the interview at the end of the match that they farmed TF on purpose. Even if Alex or Diamond (on Nasus) died, it was worth it to stop xPeke from getting items early. In fact, Peke had to go for a Zhonya's before a Lich Bane just because he was pressured so much.

Without split pushing

Gambit finally figured out how a team can stop Fnatic early. You kill Peke at all costs. You have your AD outfarm Yellowstar. And you go for picks that have hard disengages so that you don't get caught out. Most importantly

**So Who's in the Worst Spot Among the Top 4?**

On paper

SK is faring a little better but not out of the woods. A tough match against Giants Gaming awaits

Fnatic wants to keep that top spot, they can't slip. aAa also look to upset them with their new roster.

Gambit will be in a dogfight with the Wolves, I think Gambit can handle anything that gets thrown at them.

Next post will focus on aAa, and Giants...",,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,

1362507039.0,19pwg5,"""Barely Protect the Twitch"" - A Theorycraft in the Workings",iPandaN,30,10,30,"**Intro:**
Hi, Fusion Blaze. We scrim our Frost/Mist teams daily, and last night we learned the newly formed Mist team loves hypercarries. Today, while engaged in theorycrafting, I listed champions that my teammates play and/or learning. Here's a composition that I came up with as a template for a late-game peaking playstyle which is hybrid of Single Target Surpress and Protect the Hypercarry.

**Example of Composition:**

-Poppy

-Rammus

-Karthus

-Twitch

-Zilean


So at first I struggled with this idea, but soon certain strengths became very apparent in this compoisition/playstyle:

-Great Engage

-Secondary engage from Rammus taunt
-During the initial part of teamfights, and Rammus should soak up alot of this damage.

-Very good ability to dive the enemy hypercarry. Poppy will dive right when Zilean gets his reset for another Q+E

-Twitch unstealths as soon as rammus pops his secondary initiate. If the tank/AP/Bruiser thereafter dives twitch He should be able to clean up fairly quickly as they've already taken Dmg from Karthus Pool

-**If they commit 3 people to diving twitch**, he can return very quickly from his Q reset/Zilean E. If worst comes to worse, Twitch kills one of the 3 people diving him, get's revived from zilean ulti, and then BotRK Actives/W/Q/Potential Flash to get away and stealth to re-engage and clean up the other two. Meanwhile, Rammus, Poppy and Karthus are diving their ADC/Support.

-**If they commit 1-2 people to diving twitch**, but now your Rammus/Poppy/Karthus are about to fight a localized 3v3. This means that karthus didn't have to blow his wall to peel, so he has an option of Walling the other 3 off from the rest of the teamfight. Because they have a hypercarry, this means they have no gapcloser to quickly return if heavily slowed, Now karthus, Rammus, and poppy can turn back and fight a localized 5v2 briefly until they come and rejoin the fight

-Zilean and Twitch's mobility allows bot lane to easily go up to the bottom jungle to help out if rammus finds the enemy jugler in his jungle

-Versatility in Champion select. I'll explain this in a later section.


**Counterplay:**
-All-in play (such as this) is 9 times out of 10 countered by poke/disengage play. So

**Champion Select:**

-In champion select, etc. **OR ""Barely Protect The Twitch""**

-Since these picks do not allow you to play a decent Poke Composition, sustian/disengage, or some other variant of sustain play. 

-This means they can go AOE

-They can opt for Poke/Disengage, and when they turret siege, your engage is just *too* heavy.

-They can go for split pushing play


Also mind you that the champions i mentioned aren't really definite, such as Hecarim. So if you pick Rammus + Twitch and see that you can't pull off poppy/karthus against whatever mid/top they pick, then pick some1 else.

I'd really like to hear some feedback/see some discussion of this! If you have any questions leave a comment

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TL;DR:** ""Barely Protect the Twitch"" seems to be a great counter to ""Protect the Kog'Maw"" and other hypercarry/late game oriented play, and countless sub-styles with your 1st two picks being Rammus and Twitch.

* Same type of CC immunity that Vi
* Cure to her itemization issues. New Wit's End is a perfect match for her and most likely covers this part. If not
* Flame Breath (E) with shorter/instant cast time
* Hitbox issues in Dragon's Descent (R). Reliable hit area is far too narrow compared to animation.

I disagree with few of the changes Riot is trying in PBE, makes itemization smoother (BotRK) and keeps her damage relevant into lategame (the very issue that Scharizard proclaimed they would address). Then there was the Dragon's Descent change to first target hit only and knockback full distance to where she lands... When ganking, the aim generally is to get between her target and his escape route and path block while whacking at them, current live version helps this goal when coming from front or sides and can be saved for later when coming from behind. Changed version on the other hand makes first case moot and benefit to behind gank is quite questionable if they have Flash up. That change also removes some power from clumping effect (for teams AoE), makes it harder to dive carries (brings a tank to peel her) and is much harder to use as an escape (pushes her chaser along).  

note. This started as a comment in r/lol but that post got deleted before I hit submit so if this type of discussion is appropriate

Firstly, they are **positions**. A **role** is *what you do for your team*. This means that your role could be initiator, or split-pusher, or assassin, poker, disengager, counter-engager, AoE CCer, but on a hard-engage team he might rather play the role of assassin. Or indeed he might fulfill both roles in a single game. Champions have **traits** like initiation, which can be applied to **roles**


1. **Being a ‘top laner’ or a ‘mid laner’ doesn’t account the vastly different champions that can be played in those lanes.** AD and AP forms of assassins, CC-trains and pokers are all seen in every lane and jungle, and all play in vastly different ways to each other both in lanes but particularly in teamfights. I play tanky champions like Jarvan IV, Cho’Gath and Zac well in the jungle, but am pretty bad at snowbally assassin junglers like Evelynn, Kha’Zix and Lee Sin. Likewise I play poke champions like Nidalee and Jayce well in both top mid lane, but struggle to get a hang of mid laners like Kassadin and Fizz.

2. **What lane you’re in is only relevant for the first fifteen minutes of the game.** After laning phase is over

3. **Lanes are hardly even relevant to the pros any more.** And it’s begun to trickle down. Various forms of 2v1 lanes and laneswaps mean that traditional top laners frequently go against traditional midlaners, Wickd has played in mid lane a couple of times, against mid laners like Bjergsen), do they crumble under the superior lane expertise of their opponent? No. We even see swaps like sOAZ taking Blitzcrank support and Yell0wstar going Shen top. More permanent changes like Bigfatlp going jungle and Nientonsoh taking top for CLG have also met with success, though under this culture of exclusively maining a single position you might expect them to have failed in the transition, being inferior to those who have played top lane or jungle for years like Saintvicous and Dyrus. Obviously you’re not as good as the pros, but it’s all relative. *If you are as good or better than your peers in terms of mechanics and game knowledge

4. **You get a better perspective on the laning phase as a whole.** You might not think that playing jungle would improve your top lane, and getting first-hand experience in each of them allows you to take that knowledge to every position. You might become more aware of how and when the enemy jungler will gank, or how to control your lane to be easier for your jungler to gank. You might get a better idea of when the best time to go ward as a support is, or when not to engage because there are too many minions at the turret and losing the CS is not worth it. You might learn from mid lane what makes you a nice easy target to roam to, and how you can prevent that or waste their time. Knowledge about the game as a whole often comes in much more handy than nuanced information about a specific lane, because it’s all about winning the game, not your lane. You can take what annoys you about playing a certain position

5. **You become a more adaptable player.** This is great for loads of reasons. Champion select goes a lot smoother when you are able to play any position. You stop caring about whether or not you can insta-lock mid lane before the other guy, you can play a tanky role in any lane, so that’s fine. Do you need someone with good waveclear, but the only position left is support? You could go for someone like Lulu, or maybe direct your team towards another strategy that doesn’t require you to turtle with waveclear, so maybe a Leona or something to aggressively start teamfights. If you were exclusively a mid laner, you would probably just pick whatever support you’re most comfortable with in this situation, and that could suck for your team comp. It also means you’re harder to be banned out or out-picked. Mid lane and jungle are left on the team. But their mid laner is Fizz and my only counter to him is banned

6. **You become a stronger teamfighter.** What I really mean is you become a stronger late game player, but struggle to survive in teamfights. Like myself, you might be able to play an AD carry fine in lane - trading well, avoiding ganks, 2v2 fighting well, pressuring the tower - but suck when it comes to positioning in teamfights. No matter how good you are in lane, how well you play your role in teamfights is *what decides the game*. Only being good at the laning phase just gives you some extra strength with which you can buffer your mistakes or misplays, being good at the laning phase gives you that extra advantage with which you become completely unkillable in a teamfight.

7. **You gain Elo.** This may be anecdotal, and though I put it down to luck I played him again because it was pretty fun. 16 wins in a row on Jarvan and 3 on Cho’Gath later, I’m Gold I. Now 18-8 on Jarvan IV, I consider Jarvan one of my most comfortable champions, even though I’d previously despised playing jungle. As I said, it’s anecdotal but I still believe that it’s because I’m good at playing *tanks* and have decent enough game knowledge to learn how to get by in jungle. I would feel comfortable playing Jarvan in top or mid lane as well, because I’m comfortable with the champion and what he can do, even though I’ve never played him in either.

So let's do away with this 'mid or feed' nonsense, not lanes!

TL;DR skill at role &gt; skill on champion &gt; skill in lane

personally

I am highly suspicious of a toxichell actually existing.

I would love to hear thoughts/opinions on this concept and I would really like to see /r/summoners host an AMA from RiotLyte so we can ask legitimate questions of him.

I've got some interesting rankings today
Enough of my nerd excitement.  Here ya go!


Week Three - THE GREAT EQUALIZER

| Rank| Team | Win-Loss | Elo Rating | Elo Change| 
|:---:|:-----:|:---------:|:-------------:|:-----:|
|1|aTn|8 - 2|1
|2|Gambit|6 - 4|1
|3|MYM|6 - 4|1
|4|SK|4 - 6|1
|5|NiP|4 - 6|1
|6|EG|4 - 6|1
|7|LD|4 - 6|1
|8|Fnatic|4 - 6|1

Wow!  What a great week for us stats nerds.  Some points of interest:

* The spread is now only 124 elo.  Last week it was 152.
* aTn went 1-1 but lost 11 elo.  Now we start to see 'strength' of win is becoming important.  It's not enough to win
* **FIVE** teams are 4 - 6 but check out the spread.  32 elo separates SK from Fnatic.  This translates into 5% advantage for SK if the two were to face off.

Now for next week's predictions!

**Quick Disclaimer:**  Elo is designed to provide a win probability estimate given the difference in rating between two teams.  These estimates are only accurate once teams are near their ""true elo

**Week 4 Match Win Probabilities**

|Blue Team|Est. Win%||Est. Win%|Red Team|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Fnatic|40.96%|vs|**59.04%**|MYM
|Gambit|41.70%|vs|**58.3%**|aTn
|EG|**51.79%**|vs|48.21%|LD
|NiP|49.33%|vs|**50.67%**|SK
|LD|**50.89%**|vs|49.11%|Fnatic
|Gambit|**50.30%**|vs|49.7%|MYM
|NiP|36.47%|vs|**63.53%**|aTn
|EG|48.06%|vs|**51.94%**|SK
|LD|41.52%|vs|**58.48%**|Gambit

|SK|45.49%|vs|**54.51%**|MYM
|NiP|**51.28%**|vs|48.72%|EG

Really the only thing we know now is that there is a LOT of parity amongst the bottom teams and it's hard to tell who is going to win.  Exciting!!

Leave your thoughts below!  Thanks everyone for your support! :D

1365308093.0,1bu4hl,EU LCS Week 8 Day 1 Thoughts - From an Analytic Fan's Perspective - Part 1,LOLEUROCKS,20,4,7,"Disclaimer: These thoughts are mine and mine only. All the pro players in the LCS scene deserve lots of respect and support as it's not easy being in their position. This is just what I think and what I have observed while watching the matches.

First

What a start to the week, while there were just solid performances all the way around. Let's take a look...

**Fnatic over SK Gaming**

As was expected, the combo of CandyPanda on Twitch and Nyph on Sona had way too little health in the early going, and the fact that neither of those characters have any possibility of escaping when they get caught made it even harder for the bottom lane to survive. Peke ganked the bottom lane often, and successfully got YellowStar and nRated ahead in terms of kills, assists, and levels.

I personally liked the Olaf pick for Kev1n because it fit his style - Olaf is just a rock that won't budge, who does damage based on health, so it doesn't really matter how much health her target has. That being said, most of TF's ganks were in bot lane because Fnatic knew that getting Kev1n was going to be much harder than fighting a Twitch and a Sona.

One part of TF's ultimate that gets overlooked very often is that it provides full vision of one's enemies, and got out of hand. Props to Fnatic for showing SK that they still have work to do concerning learning how to shut down the split push.

It can be said that Fnatic actually picked TF due to the fact that Twitch+Sona was revealed right before that pick. It was the perfect pick for such a lane. The MF and Lulu pick that Fnatic had in the beginning were just solid, and Olaf with Elise. It is said that some games are won in the pick/ban phase, and I must agree that this was the case here. When teams are so evenly matched, every champion pick matters...

**Gambit Gaming over Evil Geniuses**

There is a lot of talk about EG's lineup in this game

The environment of the LCS series is a harsh one. It is a great community of players and they have a lot of respect for each other (especially among Gambit, and Fnatic), but at the end, this is their lifestyle, this is what they do for a living. The concept of a twenty-eight game season in ten weeks means that there is so much time to think of new strategies and new picks. Riot also makes things not easy by having so many patches and new champions, which makes the game more fun but also makes it much harder to master. A pro team must deal with how to handle all this while traveling and being under the scrutiny of the audience. Please, people, one must prevail. Unless you are constructively criticizing, they have feelings

Anyway, Elise against Darien, and Thresh against Edward, cause that's just a must. Genja first picks MF, big surprise there (not really) - MF is a caster-based champion, which fits so well into Gambit's playstyle - team fighting. EG counters with Varus and Lulu, which has good push and poke, though, along with every other top European top laners

And they did. Malzahar and Malphite. It did seem like Malzahar could mid, and if they get ambushed, MF can use the Make it Rain to slow down the enemies while Sona can speed up both of them and heal as well. Compared to the Twitch/Sona lane that SK had against Fnatic, there was a much higher chance of escape by Gambit because there wasn't going to be that teleport that would come, with a guaranteed stun. They might trade summoner spells, but that wouldn't be too bad overall. Kha Zix was actually a very solid pick against Malzahar because he can farm from afar using void spikes and then go leaping all over the place in later levels. 

This, and Malphite solo lane... And here is where people go crazy on EG. I think that it was a risk that EG took, but it was one that they were willing to take. At their position - 10-8 at the time - they wanted to spring a new lineup against Gambit. Akali is a massive gap closer, and Malphite can just knock anyone up in the air. Malzahar does so much single target damage. The potential was there to kill someone off the map and then fight the rest. The idea was great. It was the application that suffered, and here is why.

Gambit is perhaps the most fundamentally sound team in the European scene. You can't rattle them very easily. They don't seem confused at all about anything that their opponents throw at them. They just go, but they always learn and adapt. 

Perhaps against a different team, shown when Snoopeh and Wickd took down Shen and Nasus very easily in a gank, but Froggen's Akali couldn't get farmed up, while Alex Ich just became a monster. Couple that with the hard CC of a Crescendo that Edward puts so well, and Bullet Time that hits everyone, and... Everyone knows the result. Alex Ich had a Pentakill, and Gambit rolled to a win.

However, is all about adapting and trying new things. Some teams bring new players to shuffle things. Some teams bring out new champions and new compositions. EG was trying to pull a new composition. They just ran it against one of the most fundamentally sound teams in all of League of Legends. In a game decided by microsecond reactions, the discipline that Gambit had paid off.

1361915099.0,19a8fa,In Depth Analysis Series for the NA LCS,CommhisW,17,1,1,"Hi. I think this subreddit is a great idea. It'd be amazing if this turns into a community where we can truly analyze games and discuss competitive teams on that basis

Trying to find an analytical niche community was the main reason I decided to start writing up some in depth analyses of the NA LCS games

So far I've written 2 analyses, along with my short thoughts on how the trends I discovered from the two games transferred over to the week 3 games for each team.
___________________________________________________
**[W2D1 DIG vs MRN](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/18p7nz/indepth_analysis_na_lcs_w2d1_dig_vs_mrn/)**

**DIG**

There wasn't too much I learned from DIG's play in the analysis, but no real consistent trends in a particular mistake. DIG played a single game vs CLG this week, and it was more or less the same. There were more mistakes against a tougher opponent, and Crumbz showed a propensity to initiate too hard with Vi, but overall it was solid play, and there were no big trends I'm willing to point out unless I see it them happen in more than just the one game. There's definitely a lot to improve on, as with all teams

**MRN**

MRN's biggest flaw in the game I analyzed, mostly by the jungler. MRN made strides to improve that this week, mostly by playing very passively in the early game. This isn't exactly the ideal long-term solution to their problem, but it still shows they've recognized they have a problem and are working to fix it. I'd say of the teams of week 3, MRN is in fact the most improved. They are still far from the top and have many other flaws to fix in other areas though. It'll be interesting to see if they've improved their early game further.
___________________________________________________
**[W2D2 GGU vs VUL](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/18yjs9/indepth_analysis_a_comprehensive_look_at_the/)**

**GGU**

For the analyzed game, especially in their teamfighting. One thing I had noted, their dragon control/awareness, was also very spotty. The coL game, in particular, featured extremely poor play in many aspects that blew their lead, after a good early start. Definitely a weak showing for GGU in both play and results

**VUL**

VUL's biggest mistakes in the analyzed game was a poor mid game approach and bad teamfighting, they played a better mid game. I have to think a big reason for their stagnation vs GGU was an unfamiliarity with the push comp, along with having Singed instead of Renekton to attempt their split push. The teamfight they had was very disorganized however. Vs coL, the also showed weaknesses in teamfighting, given the lead they had. There were also times they failed to transition from a fairly stagnant position in the mid game once again, though their lead was huge enough that it didn't even come close to mattering. Vs MRN, a teamfight at drag and a catch top into a baron rushed the game past the mid game. The teamfighting was a mixed bag. Overall, but not by too much. They certainly played much better than they did against GGU,,1361930259.0

Offensive masteries are intended for **Primary Damage Dealers (Marksman, and Secondary Damage Dealers (Mage Supports, Junglers)**

http://i.imgur.com/sAIQJAC.png

##Remove Summoner’s Wrath
- Shift the bonuses for each summoner spell onto the spells themselves and remove this uninspiring

##Swap Brute Force and Fury and buff both
- 4% Attack speed is underwhelming for most champions, would be better positioned as a viable alternative to Sorcery in the first tier. Fury granting a higher attack speed necessitates the removal of Frenzy, a mastery that is adopted mostly by Marksman. Its impact is rather situational, which is difficult to recognize and appreciate by many players.

##Split Havoc into auto attack and ability based versions
- Havoc suffers first of all for its limited power. 2% of 2000 Damage is only 40

##New offensive support mastery

- Currently

##New mastery for fast jungle clears

- Junglers (Fighters

_________________________________________
Defensive masteries are intended for **Primary Tanks and Fighters

http://i.imgur.com/YyOSplm.png

##Remove Summoner’s Resolve
- Shift the bonuses for each summoner spell onto the spells themselves and remove this uninspiring one point necessity. Alternatively

##New defensive support mastery
- Like the offensive option

##Rework Perseverance into a new mastery for safer jungle clears
- An alternative to the offensive jungle mastery for Junglers investing deep into defense (support tanks)

_________________________________________
Utility masteries are intended for **Primary Supports and some Mages

http://i.imgur.com/aO2BRdg.png

##Remove Summoner’s Insight
- Shift the bonuses for each summoner spell onto the spells themselves and remove this uninspiring

##New Initiator mastery
- For deep investment

##New CC based Mage mastery
- This new mastery would be in line with the other suggestions that provide novel ways for Supports to contribute to their team’s damage or their own survivability. It would be a useful way for Mages with CC to advance that particular strength when investing more points into the utility tree as an alternative to offense. Anytime you CC an enemy champion with an ability

##Rework Scout
- Extra vision range for wards has been a largely underwhelming option

##Move Vampirism to Defense
- Both Life Steal and Spell Vamp are essentially methods for sustain--active game play linked ways to regenerate health. Oddly positioned in the middle of the utility tree, and Junglers with making substantial sacrifices in primary trees. Lifesteal quints as well make the options seem even more obsolete. Shifting it to a lower tier in Defense can set it as an alternative to the flat heath and mitigation options that are otherwise mandatory choices.

Those of us who have been playing for a while will recall how both support and jungle used to buy multiple gold generation items because it was the only way to stay somewhat relevant if the game went to lategame. Thankfully

However

I see no problems with the jungle and support having access to slightly more gold, and laners are still buying that item...

**So here's my proposed solution for the support role:**

It would be a new

""You receive 5 gold every time you gain xp from an enemy you didn't kill""

This would put its optimal gold generation at twice that of Philostone

**For junglers:**

Machete and its upgrades would get an additional passive that grants a small amount of gold on monster kills. This amount would have to be small enough for machete items not to be a good investment for anyone other than the jungler.

I've recently been focusing much of my efforts on expanding my Champion pool. I've been playing the same champs for awhile


 - have more options to counterpick/complement team comp


 - Expand my knowledge of each champion even more so that my understanding of the game will increase


Please bare with me as I know that I do not have as much knowledge as many of you


Undoubtedly, masteries, and general formatting of the jungle. 


The change in influence these champions bring to the table has caused many of the previously deemed go-to champions to become less used


I would like to discuss Shyvana who has fallen from grace as it were in the professional scene. 


Please note that though she may have been picked in LCS games, Cho, Xin, J4, or Elise (or any other that you see with specific comps).


Lets get started!


- **Shyvana**: The previous Queen in all her glory and favorite of many junglers seems to have run into a rut as of late. As an avid shyvana lover, Shyvana excells in diving carries, applying immense pressure to entire zones of the fight, and detering dives not by hard CC, but by sheer damage potential. In general, you don't mess with a farmed shyvana unless you're confident you can out manuever her.


So whats the problem? Why isn't she seen very often?


The answer everyone says upfront is that her ganks are trash. She doesn't bring anything to the table with a gank other than damage output and decent chase. If the enemy has an escape


My theory however is the main reason Shyvana is less useful currently is the lack of complimentary picks


 Just as a Volibear loves ganking a Leona/Graves lane due to the ridiculous burst and CC, Shyvana ganking a Shen/Elise/J4, the kill potential skyrockets as the enemy is CC'd upfront, followed by the Shyv's Exhaust.


- **Team Fighting Issues**: When a Shyvana gets behind, but little more than a zoning champion who is easily kited with the right Carry and Peel. Any shyvana player knows the annoyance of trying to dive onto a Trist/Ez/Cait only to be stopped mid air by a thresh, get knocked back by a cannon ball, slowed by a 90 caliber net, or laughed at from over a wall.


So what do we do? What tool could be used to get her back up to snuff?


The answer lies in team comp. 


Certain junglers have so much reliable CC and base damage that it almost doesn't matter when you pick them


An excellent and somewhat classic example of this lies in Orianna. I personally have 2 v 3'd and 2 v 4'd an enemy team with my AP carry teammate playing orianna. The synergy in diving into the enemy with Ori ball, and then for these unlucky champions to be hit by Burnout, Flame Breath, and Twin Fang unloads RIDICULOUS damage in the space of a couple seconds. Couple this with a rumble ult, Leona ult, and Varus/MF ult and you'll be watching the fight go from a 5 v 5 to a 5 v 3 or 5 v 2 almost instantly, especially if you catch them in the jungle or at a dragon or baron.


Another viable option is with a Shen top lane. As you go to ult


**Problems with this**


Some of the issue with these comps is that many times, even when you do the coordination is just not there.

1) Quinn is probably the best champion design visually / thematically in the past year. Vi is too 'fan service' for my liking

2) Quinn is built around her passive. Her passive is high risk, it's best to use it before casting E, else you lose the 2nd proc. Wait for Valor to mark a  target, AA, E, AA, Q, especially hard CC like Taric

Quinn's passive *will* target the last champion hit. Try to poke their AD or squishy supports -- but this discourages ever attacking a champ like Taric or Leona in lane...you will lose a lot of DPS

3) Her blind is great against autoattackers: Draven, Ashe, to a degree MF (if the MF maxes W). 

4) Her sight aura (W) has a prohibitively long cooldown. Don't use it to check for jungle ganks

5) Her E is hard countered by Singed, pretty much anyone with targeted powerful CC that is low range. If you are trying to escape a Singed, you can't with E you'll need to pop ult and try your luck at running away. 

Her E is only an escape if you have your back to the wall and E an enemy at a perpendicular angle. This is very easy to do in the dragon pit

To use E as a gap closer

6) Her ulti is too weak for what it is (or, less range, longer cooldown, lower AoE than Graves' ult. The value is using it as a steroid in an engage that is 1v1 ""either you do, or I"" all-ins. **You lose her passive while ulting**. This is one of the most frustrating parts of the ult. If you get two passive procs off (one proc then an E AA), you lose damage since the execute is so weak.

7) Her Q has a terrible animation in ult form. Hard to notice. No added benefit. Less effective range (in terms of damage) because you take up part of the AoE. In my opinion this is one area she needs to be changed: double the Q range in ult form.

8) Her ulti is prohibitive if the execute damage doesn't kill the target. You gap close, then attack -- but after ult form is down your Q/E are still on CD. IMO this could use the Rengar treatment, in that his 5-stack abilities can be double cast.

Anyway. I'll think of more later after I get more than 15 games in with her. Thoughts?",,t5_2wenn,False,,gambit,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1aws87/my_thoughts_on_quinn_and_some_suggested_changes/
1363901727.0,1arbol,The Most Important Tournament We Know Nothing About?,WhiskeynaBiscuit,17,2,23,"I was attempting to find information related to the May Promotion Tournament for an article.  Does  this information not exist or have I just missed it?

This past weekend Could 9 and Velocity esports won a spot in the NA LCS May Promotion Tournament.  Two teams for the EU will earn a spot in the EU LCS May Promotion Tournament this weekend when the LCS travels to France.  The promotion tournaments promise to be incredibly exciting as challenger teams battle to make it in the LCS and established teams fight to keep them out.

The only issue is Riot has told us precious little about these matches.  The [F.A.Q.](http://na.lolesports.com/season3/split1/about#tabs=3) on Lolesports.com tells us how the bottom 4 LCS teams are selected
 
Questing for a riot response I eventually ended up at [this reddit ama](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/169tp6/season_3_league_of_legends_championship_series/)  RiotMagus says
&gt;The bottom 4 teams after the first half of the season will have to play their way back in. There'll be a 16-team promotion tournament during the All-Star break - 8 challenger teams

So 12 “rising stars” 8 of the Challenger Teams

Unfortunately it’s conflicting.  First the page says that top 32 Teams will compete for 4 spots in the promotion tournament.  Then further down it says the top 16 teams will play for 4 spots.  I have no idea whether it is 16 or 32 and both say that 4 Challenger Teams Qualify

And then what are the partner events?  Flipping through tournament information pages and hoping that one of them mentions it seems the only way to find them.  IPL 6 was going to be one

Am I missing something really obvious? I just find it hard to believe Riot has left us hanging related to this important event.

Edit: Alex Penn bringing in the knowledge with the LCS rulebook.  Not the most publicized place but certainly one I should have checked. ",,t5_2wenn,1363918388.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1arbol/the_most_important_tournament_we_know_nothing/

1375659918.0,1jphj8,I redid my damage calculations for Master Yi's damage output (x-post /r/leagueoflegends),golf1052,18,2,7,"In my first set of calculations I didn't account for crit change or Shiv's damage so the numbers were off. Also the targets I used were at a lower point than what a full build target would be at. So this time around crits are calculated across the board. On Yi's AA damage, and 5% more damage to targets under 50% health from Executioner. The builds however were the same from last time.

Berserker's Greaves, Bloodthirster, Phantom Dancer, Last Whisper  
Berserker's Greaves, Bloodthirster, Statikk Shiv, Last Whisper  
Berserker's Greaves, Blade of the Ruined King, Phantom Dancer, Last Whisper  
Berserker's Greaves, Blade of the Ruined King, Statikk Shiv, Last Whisper

For targets I now used 3 full build targets. A very squishy champ, armor, and magic resist at level 18 were 2125, 133, and 56 respectively.

For the tankiest ADC I used Graves who had his passive fully stacked and had either Guardian's Angel or Randuin's Omen as a defensive item. He also had [9 points in the defensive mastery tree.](http://i.imgur.com/cvpQB5J.png) His health, 170.6, and 102 for GA and 2560, 190.6, and 62 for Randuin's.

For the tank target I chose Shen with Armor boots, Spirit Visage, Trinity Force, and either Warmog's or Randuin's as his last item. He also had [22 points in the defensive mastery tree.](http://i.imgur.com/ac0uF6W.png) I did apply the 2 less damage from all sources (except for true damage), 3 less damage from all AA's, 10% less crit damage from all sources (this includes Master Yi's Q), and 3% less damage from all sources (except for true damage). Shen's health, and magic resist at level 18 were 4675.84, and 113.475 with Randuin's.

When calculating the damage from items, BotRK's active damage, and Shiv's damage all the time if applicable. However for Q and Shiv I did two separate calculations for if they did or did not crit since you Q once at the beginning before you auto attack them and since Shiv only procced once during all the fights (Yes, everybody died in under 10 auto attacks).

After all that pre-explanation here is all the data I collected: http://sdrv.ms/12QhWBB

**TL;DR:** If you want to kill a lower health/armor target go BotRK with either PD or Shiv with Armor Pen reds. If you want to kill a tanky ADC without Randuin's go BotRK with either PD or Shiv. Reds don't matter here. However if the ADC has Randuin's go BT with PD and Armor Pen reds but only if your Q crits. If your Q doesn't crit then go BotRK with PD. If you want to kill a tank with or without Randuin's go BotRK with PD and Armor Pen reds.

**TL;DR of the TL;DR: Run BotRK

Now here are the results:

**KEY:**  
BRK = Blade of the Ruined King  
BT = Bloodthirster  
PD = Phantom Dancer  
Shiv = Statikk Shiv  
AD = Attack Damage Reds  
AR = Armor Pen Reds

Remember Q and any actives are applied first before auto attacks.

Ok


I've been playing Kha'Zix since he came out
When the changes to Kha'Zix kicked in the PBE, and the red posts, I was pretty damn excited. But I feel like they just changed the viable route to Q&gt;E&gt;R/W instead of W&gt;E&gt;R/Q.


**Thoughts:** I think that Kha feels more like an assasin now, but evolving his W you would have to sacrifice evolving other ability which would harm his full potential, for example his R now helps him getting in and out of fights more effectively and making Kha more durable while doing more damage thanks to being able to toggle his ult and getting his passive one more time, or his Q which is his main source of damage, and in my opinion not evolving his E is unforgivable because it greatly increases his mobility. What are your thoughts?

**Rank 1(-): *Team WE* / result 10 1 / 1st place**

Team WE continue to show they are just too stable and too hard to beat in the league. Not only able to get the results they want

**Highlighted player: *WE.Fzzf* / support**

We all know everyone in WE can be the key factor in any game. This surely included their support player in Fzzf. He played only Elise this week



**Rank 2 (-): *Invictus Gaming* / result 9 2 / 2nd place**

IG lost another game, IG again shows their over-risky plays can sometime backfire really hard. Even though IG still is the only team that could test WE's domination in China, but it seems time still needed for the team to find the balance between win the game and kill the game. Xiaoxiao need to be more accurate with his famous ultis and illusion should never be a real shadow in his games. 

**Highlighted player: *IG.Zz1tai* / mid**

As the no.1 ranking on the MVP chart



**Rank 3 (+2): *Royal.HZ* / result 6 5 / 5th place**

Even though Royal still is only 5th place, Royal must maintain their current form into next 2 weeks in order to fight for the top 4 finish. 

**Highlighted player: *Royal.Uzi* / adc**

When more and more people try to convince you that Uzi is actually better individually compare to Weixiao, and with this young age, you can only fear that another monster adc is in making to haunt the world of LOL, again from China. 



**Rank 4 (-1): *OMG* / result 7 4 / 3rd place** 

OMG has a less impressed weekend with a 1 2 finish. Not only lost to WE which people does not expect the opposite result

**Highlighted Player: *OMGlovelin* / support**

Continue to stay at 2nd overall ranking on the MVP chart of LPL



**Rank 5 (-1): *Positive Energy* / result 6 5 / 4th place**

PE has drop 1 place on the power ranking only because Royal's impressive weekend performance. Despite unable to give any challenge to WE

**Highlighted player: *PE.JingGG* / jungle**

Even though Jing was unable to test clearlove in the WE vs PE game, and improve the general performance in every lane. Expect more target ban on Jing in next few weeks. 



**Rank 6 (-): *Team LM* / result 3 8 / 6th place**

Failed to win any game this week, both side has made numbers of mistakes that could hardly see in the highest level of Asian games and only to lose by making more mistakes is nothing too good to think about. If LM unable to get any result from the other 2 struggling teams, they may seriously in trouble and could face a tough fight in the relegation battle. 

Highlighted player: none



**Rank 7 (+1): *Wayi Spider* / result 1 10 / 8th place**

Finally achieve their 1st win of the season, they may just continue to struggle and never look like a team to expect any results. 

Highlighted player: None



**Rank 8 (-1): *Wings of Aurora* / result 2 9 / 7th place**

WOA got destroyed by WE and IG in last 2 weeks

1362622464.0,19tgm0,Let's talk Malzahar,drothdarr,17,1,19,"Greetings everyone

I am Drothdarr, I love his capabilities of both farming and dueling, and hist 1-hit-combo playstyle. Now, as we all know, he is not in a very good shape in the competitive scene, maybe because he is forgotten, has an outdated kit
Back in Season 1, because of his excellent pushing abilities, only matched by Karthus and Anivia. However, as game changed, it evolved into a more mobile playstyle, where most 'viable' champions had some sort of gap closer or manouverability skill. This, paired with the lack of escape and an ultimate that stuns Malzahar in place





&gt;Let's take a look at his information



**Base Health:** 380 -&gt; *89th highest*

**Health per level:**  80 -&gt; *81st highest*

**Health Regeneration:** 4.5 -&gt; *86th highest*

**Health Regeneration per level:** 0.55 -&gt; *66th highest*

**Mana:** 250 -&gt; *20th highest*

**Mana per level:** 45 -&gt; *31st highest*

**Mana Regeneration:** 7 -&gt; *11st highest*

**Mana Regeneration per level:** 0.6 -&gt; *29th highest*

**Range:** 550 -&gt; *9th highest*

**Attack Damage:** 51.7 -&gt; *59th highest*

**Attack Damage per level:** 3 -&gt; *97th highest*

**Armor:** 15 -&gt; *45th highest*

**Armor per Level:** 3.5 -&gt; *37th highest*

**Magic Resist:** 30 -&gt; *Same as everybody

**Movement Speed:** 340 -&gt; *41st highest*




&gt;**Abilities:**

***Q: Call of the Void***

- AoE line nuke with 400 width
- Magic Damage
- Base damage: 80 / 135 / 190 / 245 / 300
- Ratio: 0.8 AP
- Silence everyone it hits for 1.4 / 1.8 / 2.2 / 2.6 / 3 seconds


*Great poking tool




***W: Null Zone***

- AoE circle DoT with 500 diameter
- Duration: 5 seconds
- Base damage per second: 4% / 5% / 6% / 7% / 8% of maximum health
- Damage per second ratio: +1% for each 100 Ability Power
- Maximum base damage:  20% / 25% / 30% / 35% / 40% of maximum health
- Maximum damage ratio: +5% per each 100 Abiliy power


*Low early game damage




***E: Malefic Visions***

- Targeted DoT spell
- Duration: 4 seconds
- Base damage: 80 / 140 / 200 / 260 / 320
- Ratio: +0.8 of Ability Power
- When a unit dies while affected by this spell
Mana Restored: 10 / 14 / 18 / 22 / 26

*Amazing farming and pushing ability



***R: Nether Grasp***

- Targeted channeled ability
- Suppresses the target
- Duration: 2.5 seconds
- Base damage per second: 100 / 160 / 220 
- Damage per second ratio: +0.52 of Ability Power
- Maximum base damage:  250 / 400 / 550 
- Maximum damage ratio: 1.3 of Ability Power


*Great dueling ability. High damage



&gt;**Win ratio and popularity:**

Popularity: 3.02%

Win ratio: 49.72%

Ban ratio: 0.08%


&gt;**Recent competitive apparitions:**

Very rare. 

MoMa used him while he was in aAa in a game vs SK.

Former CJ-Entus Dade used him in a cheese Soraka+Malzahar mid uber aggressive pushing strat.


&gt;**Pros:**

- Great pushing power
- Lane dominant
- Great duelist
- Reasonable sustain
- Good ganker
- High damage output

&gt;**Cons:**

- Very vulnerable to early ganks
- Falls of late game
- Requires very careful positioning
- Can't peel for himself
- No escape mechanism
- Roots himself during his ultimate
- Quicksilver Sash counters his combo

After this introduction to who is Malzahar

- In the current meta-game of HP stacking
- Is QSS really a problem? In my opinion
- Are Malzahar's base stats up-to-date with current FotM AP casters?
- Are the new items such as Liandry's really boosting Malzahar's performance?
- What changes to Malzahar's numbers and kit would make him viable
- Scarra once said that Malzahar's cast animations were  too long and really holding him back. How come?


Feel free to discuss this thread about one of my favourite champions. Cheers!

Since then, I have interviewed and translated for ggChronicle at the S2 League of Legends World Championships, and casted and translated for Major League Gaming. I began my career here at OGN January of 2013, coming over to work as a Creative Director for global content and Assistant Global Business Manager. Of course I still translate whenever possible and sub as a caster for MonteCristo and/or DoA, the official casters for OGN.

OGN is proud to announce the Club Masters tournament

*********
**What makes Club Masters different?**

OGN created Club Masters to showcase the depth and versatility of Korean teams.

**Note that OGN changed the format after the picks/bans took too long in day one:** Picks and bans in Club Masters will be conducted by each team's coach after they select players from their benches to play the game. Each game the coach must rotate in at least one new player to keep things fresh.

This tournament should offer some wild strategies and never-before-seen dream team rosters. Be sure to tune in when it starts tomorrow!

1373506389.0,1i1tr1,Exploring Asian Episode 2: Chinese LPL Summer Season Returns on 12th July,Zavrodis,14,0,1,"Been a really long long break from posting on reddit due to personal reason

The Summer Season of LPL remain as 8 teams playing ONLY 3 Circle of BO1s

During the Spring season and playoff

One Team that has been dominating the whole China lol scene, and they really take on the chance to shine in playing LPL. Not only had dominating result against IG ( 7 2 since lpl start, in all official competitions), but been winning every competition lately. They have Clowned as champion in 3 straight tournaments in China in less than a month, started from the great showing in LPL playoff, beat WE and PE in progress; also champion of WVW cup and starswar 8. They are now the team to beat in China as none of the top teams able to adapt well to their style of play which is as fast as the korean but even more teamfight-centralized. 

OMG would look to continue its domination and since they already got the ticket to the qualifier ( top 2 in Spring regular season)

Another team should be look at is Positive Energy

China.PE is sponsor by a famous chinese gaming organization: 'china' which is equally influential as another powerhouse 'royal' (sponsor of Royal.HZ). This new sponsorship enable PE to improve their financial power and Independence

PE has been doing really well in past 1 month. Not only step up their games to be on bar of WE/IG but also reach some results that has never expected by fans before, former known as PE.Devil, also reach his peak performance as able to dominate every single bot lane opponent in China. Lately, the often pointed as the weak link of PE, top laner Aluka, also step up his game by alot as Kennen being one of his best champion. Add together mid laner Jojo and support + Captain Sicca which both been good players, PE looks highly possible to bring out some real challenge to the 2 tickets for China at the S3 World final. 



The Old Boys, are all looking to return to their best as soon as possible. **World Elite** in particular, has really disappointed millions of their local fans in China in performance recently. Their passive style often criticized by viewers as not matching the meta well. And only 1 title in every competition since lost to IG in SWL2 can not match the former image of the unbeatable team of the world. WE's problem could be internal + external but one of the most seriously problem now is the moral factor of the team is in all-time lowest level since Clearlove and Fzzf join the team before S2 final Last year. 

WE has problem in adapting to the new meta and get hit on moral by all the unsatisfied results. **Invictus Gaming** on another hand, after all-stars. The lost to Korea in AS brought a lot of analyses and different views to the Chinese LoL scene, many teams try to adapt to the Korean style of playing with faster pace and picking up broken champions fitting the pace. But all of these changes did not go too well for IG as they struggled a lot between changing and remaining.  But IG do have enough individual talents in the team which is a really good part of their problem, as long as they are able to pick up what they really want to play, the old fearful IG team will be back to the scene in no time. (But again, moral factor is a big part to the IG team here). 

Another team that could make some challenge to the S3 ticket is **Royal.HZ**. The recent return of Tabe at the support role already show some small improvement of the team as they are able to bring more to the table rather than the old everything-about-UZI. With Uzi continue to be strong

Another team that remain from the Spring season was the 6th place team LM, now switch to the Mid Lane. 2 Players from Royal.TC (ex-royal b team) has mix up with the team under the sponsorship and team-reform. Dreams, playing as jungle and PandaB at support, would have to wait and see if they can bring the LMQ.TC to another level or remain as the team fight for avoiding relegation. 

2 new teams in the Summer Season are EP.HK, drop out from the S3 qualifier of Taiwan/Hongkong/Macau region to participant in the LPL. They believe playing in LPL would improve their team far more than remain in the qualifier and get destroy by the taiwanese teams. Their No.1 mission of the season is to avoid seating at the last spot of LPL. 

Another team in the LPL summer is YG, This team is expect to bring out many New thing to the table and try to win some game and avoid relegation.

After seeing [this](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=3551106) thread on the front page of the main subreddit, the core meta (what roles are selected) has not changed since S1 Worlds. Is ADC truly the menace responsible for stagnating LoL? Were bruisers truly too strong for ADCs to handle?

---

Personally, but the item is incredibly inefficient compared to in S2 when it was significantly cheaper. This nerf really hurt heroes like Darius, Irelia, Olaf, etc. In fact, throughout S3, bruiser items have been repeatedly nerfed

Additionally, Urgot (46.0%) [does he even count anymore?], and Corki (44.7%). Draven has the second highest winrate of all heroes (54.5%). Twitch is the only other ADC with a winrate above 51%, and he's not too far above it (52.7%). Every other ADC, on average, wins 49% or more games they are in. **Generally, ADC winrates fall into an average between 49 and 51 percent.** This is likely due to the fact that there are usually 2 ADCs in every game.

The fact that the values are averaging out could also be an indicator that **ADCs bring the same chance of victory to the team**. These heroes have incredibly consistent win-rates in solo queue. In an arranged game, the team whose ADC does more DPS is more likely win the team-fight. High-level players can focus their abilities on protecting their ADC or blitzing the enemy's ADC/APC, depending on which would be more beneficial. This tends to happen towards the end-stages of the game. **The end-game of almost every game revolves around the ADC.** There's obviously going to be exceptions - there are APCs and Bruisers who have amazing late-games - but in a relatively typical scenario, teams are relying mainly on their ADCs for the bulk of their damage after 30 minutes. 

I feel like the biggest issue at the moment is that anti-ADC items are not strong enough anymore. If a team wanted to opt for a meta-change and run dual bruiser versus support/ADC

I used to run Pantheon/Taric cheese botlane, as a bruiser, completely nullify the enemy ADC (either through denying farm or through assassinating them quickly in a fight)? If not, can I output a comparable amount of damage over the same amount of time without putting myself in harm's way? A lot of the time, I was winning my games by forcing all-ins at level 3/4 and killing either of my lane opponents. I would snowball so hard that the enemy ADC would lose farm and the enemy jungler would waste time coming bottom. However, if I did not succeed in shutting down the enemy before they base  (with anywhere between 1k and 2k gold), the enemy ADC would have a huge advantage simply because their auto attacks come off cooldown faster than Pantheon's Q does. Their damage starts to outscale bruiser damage because of their range. Outplaying and coming out ahead in exchanges becomes incredibly difficult once item scaling kicks in.

**tl;dr** my opinions on bruisers and ADCs

I think these are the 2 biggest stories out of NA:

Complexity has been on the rise with Pr0lly

CLG, they'll first have to fight through Doublebuff. Doublebuff has been largely ignored but they are the higher seed in this matchup.

The app is designed to help you organise the roles for a team

To do this

*Example result:*  http://i.imgur.com/dYpcXVo.png

The app is designed to take information directly via a copypaste from pregame / champselect chat

At the moment, it should allow for a few more forms of data. 

**Future Plans**

*     More accepted names for roles
*     Better error checking / failure to parse messages
*     Optimistic or Pessimistic options for unspecified roles. This makes a surprising amount of difference.
*     Dealing with ties more effectively (surprisingly rare if most information is completed)
*     Sorting of team variations by score
*    Ability to input information via a form (dropdown boxes

The first pro that comes to mind is that it's hard to counter lanes, you're sort of forced to pick a ""safe"" champion, because in the process of countering KZ, you can easily be countered by the team swapping which lane he plays.

I can think of two cons. The first is that a ban can be doubly effective. Targeted bans could

Well, they'd be more difficult to ban out, but I think they'd end up losing a lot of lanes to more focused players.

Blaze went with the pair of Cpt Jack and Muse for the series which arguably was a decision that went in their favor. Jack Sparrow, but still managed to get himself caught out a few times. Muse was solid throughout the games including some solid Crescendos and seemed to be overall, more effective than Lustboy has been.  

Blaze made some questionable decisions in picks and bans in almost every game

6/9 games played yesterday had him

Bitfatlp (Mid) and Grim Samurai (Top) have a 100% pick and win rate with him so far.

1368130834.0,1e0ula,China LPL Power Ranking Pre-Week 9,Zavrodis,13,0,2,"Long since the last ranking and it has been very colorful and eventful 2 weeks. Ok lets jump into the ranking right away. 

**Rank 1: Team OMG / 1st / 18W5L**

If you are wondering which team could be the most on Form team atm around the world

**Rank. 2: Invitus Gaming / 2nd / 18W5L**

IG is still tied on win/lose record with omg in lpl but the result between these 2 teams is 0 5 in favor of omg in both lpl and ges qualifier. IG has been very stable in lpl

**Rank. 3: Team WE / 3rd / 16W7L**

The long lasted leader of the Chinese lol scene is having some spiky period in their games past few weeks. They could do really well against IG and PE

**Rank. 4: Positive Energy and Royal.HZ / 4th and 5th / 14W9L and 11W12L**

PE and Royal has done quite similarly in recent weeks. PE continue to be able to secure wins against weaker teams in lpl and also beat IG in GES qualifier and Royal had done quite good against OMG and WE. Royal maybe less impressed in lpl but they beat PE in GES qualifier a day before yesterday to reach the LAN final equal up the performance from both team in past 15 days. 

**Rank. 6: Team LM / 6th / 8W15L**

Team LM could be most impressed team lately from the lpl. Although there is no Chance for them to reach the playoff as top 4

**Rank.7: Wings of Aurora / 7th / 5W18L**

WOA is another team from the bottom 3 finally step up their games lately. Their latest role switch

**Rank.8: Wayi.Spider / 8th / 2W21L**

Spider from a highly regarded team to the 1st team to relegate to the tga promotion series only took 2 month. The unstable medical condition of their key member and lack of experience in some of the other players could be a key reason behind their fall. They will have a very very hard time in the tga promotion series with at least 6 to 8 teams are expected to be better than them.

*Top 5 Players in last 2 weeks*

1. OMGogoing

2. OMGcool

3. LiveMoreWayoff

4. PE.NameI (devil)

5. WOA.Haokai


**Regarding GES competition LAN final**

Will be play in Shanghai on the 18th and 19th of May. The 4 participants are Team WE

**Regarding LPL playoff**

Which is also this year's TGA summer tournament. Top 4 ranking in the spring season will enter. First place vs forth

The positions looks pretty set already in the EU allstars team. The top contenders for the mid lane are pretty close to eachother and may shuffle around

So what do you all think of the current team consisting of Diamondprox, Yellowpete and maybe xPeke. Is it the best that EU has to offer? The rumoured language barriers looks to not be of too much trouble with Diamondprox knowing both english and russian and being able to translate for EDward, but the bot lane synergy will be worse.",,False,,t5_2wenn,,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1bnc9i/eu_allstars_m5egfnatic/

1373188678.0,1hsniy,What are the top tier 2v1 / 1v2 champions?,kaszanix,15,4,26,"With the rise of the 2v1 lane matchups in all lanes I would like to start a discussion on the champions best suited for this role. Since in the current DoTA meta laners going solo vs usually multiple opponents in the long lane are called *suicide laners*

* What are the most desirable qualities these champions should have?
* Which champions are currently picked in the competitive scene and why? Provide VoDs if possible.
* Are there any champions that in your opinion fit the bill of being good 1v2 perfectly but aren't used? Why do you think so?

As for my opinion to start off the discussion... I believe the most important qualities of a 1v2 laner are:

* **ability to farm from range/quickly waveclear** - probably the most important thing
* **ability to deter tower dives** - whether it is by being tanky
* **ability to stay relevant even with inferior farm** - regardless of his waveclear abilities

As for the list of champions that fit that role

* **Elise** - Often used by MYM Kubon ([example game 1](http://www.twitch.tv/dreamhacklol/b/417659901?t=3h48m13s), which are very cheap. Combination of her mobility/CC/high damage makes it a good lane for Elise's jungler to gank for despite no numbers advantage - [Example 1](http://www.twitch.tv/dreamhacklol/b/417659901?t=3h54m30s), [Example 2](http://www.twitch.tv/dreamhacklol/b/417659901?t=10h35m00s). Very flexible in both her build / teamfight role, can fulfill the roles of tank/splitpusher/assassin/initiator - she is decent at all of these roles, but excels at none.

This is it from me for now, Kennen, Nasus, Olaf, Renekton, Shen, Udyr, Zac.

Hello again boys and girls


| Rank| Team | Elo Rating | Change| Win-Loss |
|:---:|:-----:|:---------:|:-------------:|:-----:|
|1|C9|1283|+8|8-2|
|2|CLG|1241|+17|6-4|
|3|VUL|1236|+23|6-4|
|4|DIG|1198|+16|5-5|
|5|CST|1195|-21|5-5|
|6|CRS|1180|+22|4-6|
|7|TSM|1156|-56|4-6|
|8|VES|1110|-10|2-8|  

C9 briefly broke the 1300 barrier after their win over CLG but their loss to Vulcun sent them back down to where they've been for the past two weeks.  This weeks big mover is TSM


____________________________________________
_______________________________

**Quick Disclaimer:**  Elo is designed to provide a win probability estimate given the difference in rating between two teams.  These estimates are only accurate once teams are near their ""true elo, season 2 solo queue anyway).

**Week 4 Match Win Probabilities**

|Blue Team|Est. Win%||Est. Win%|Red Team|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|CRS|42%|vs|**58%**|VUL|
|VES|46%|vs|**54%**|TSM|
|C9|**62%**|vs|38%|DIG|
|CLG|**57%**|vs|43%|CST|
|CRS|36%|vs|**64%**|C9|
|TSM|44%|vs|**56%**|CST|
|VES|32%|vs|**68%**|CLG|
|DIG|45%|vs|**55%**|VUL|

So CLG vs Velocity is the biggest mismatch we've had so far

**NA and EU ratings for last season!**

This project has been a lot of fun for me

/u/hehewaffles has generously posted his results on his website [here](http://lcs.damondoucet.net/).  There you can see how each team was rated after each of the spring split's 10 weeks for both NA and EU

**Spring Split Final Ratings**

**Some Quick Math Notes**

* I did indeed start everyone at 1200 elo.
* I am using a k of 36
* I am willing to consider decreasing k mid way through the season once scores have had a chance to settle a bit
* Win probability estimates are calculated using the following formula: 1/(1+10^((rating of B - rating of A)^)/400 )",,t5_2wenn,False,,dignitas,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1hfzri/na_lcs_week_3_unofficial_elo_ratings_xpost/

1364723018.0,1bcoes,"[Discussion] Another Karma post. Thoughts about matchups in bot lane. (Warning, wall of text. But don't worry, you can still pick out my main ideas easily.)",higherKey,19,24, so we definitely didn't tap fully into what potential we found. However

####Karma.
Lets start with a little explanation of Karma. Her role as a burst champion has stayed, in which case fuck you. Phreak mentioned this combo in the spotlight and I think it could become her bread-and-butter. Another good combo is with melee champions if you get a slow off and they run in, you can use your shield to AOE burst effectively. When running, place your w on melee champions like Yi. If you root a ranged champ or mage they can still get damage off. We didn't get a chance to much else, so if you've found anything good leave a comment!

####AP Ezreal.
I have to explain AP Ez before continuing. I've been playing him a fair amount recently, as she could give me easy skillshots with her slow and a guaranteed ult with her root. (On a related note, I always play AP ez when I lane with a Sona. Extra mana, high burst/poke, and a perfect ult wombo combo.)

###Karma's matchups.
I'm looking at Karma with the specific recent experience of AP Ezreal, and AD Ezreal. I'll also mention Draven, Caitlyn, Varus, and Vayne, as well as Quinn for later. Karma can provide the moment those characters need in order to get off their damage and amplifies the moment with her own burst. These are the champions I think that could synergize well with Karma. Now, for the ""burst"" matchups. Karma is a burst champion. That's what they made her into. I think the best champions to compare Karma to would be a Lux/Morgana support. You can loosely think about Karma in a similar way as I talk about some specific champions and their potential. I'll number each combo at the from [1] (bad combination) to [5] (perfect match). No 1's for this section.

- Corki: *no personal experience* [2-3] - Corki's missiles would be a breeze with Karma's cc. Also good double q burst. No sustain for Corki's mana hunger. Potentially good combo.
- Graves: *little personal experience* [4] - Good burst combo. Shield damage fits well with Grave's up close and personal damage style. Consider more E levels. Good combo.
- Ezreal: *some personal expereince* [3] - Similar to AP Ezreal play
- Draven: *little personal experience* [3-4] - Good setups for Draven's high damage with her slow, **requires more thought.**
- Caitlyn: *little personal experience* [2-3] - With Caitlyn's long range, don't quote me on this, but if Karma's q gives vision, you could catch an enemy with Cait's ult as they run. I haven't tested this, though. Limited combo potential. Fair combo.
- Varus: *little personal experience* [3-4] - Burst potential with Varus' E (and Q). Good kiting with speed buff for blight stacks. Karma's root would make Varus' ultimate highly reliable and effective. Fairly good combo.
- Vayne: *some personal experience* - [4] Both share an aggressive playstyle. Similar pros as Graves. I can't find the range of her Mantra'd E effect. If it's at least 525, potentially very good combo.
- **Quinn**: *little personal experience* ~~[5]~~[3] - Mechanically, but Quinn probably needs some buffs or QOL changes to be effective. Nonetheless, I think it would be a fun lane to try out. Potentially good combo, restricted by Quinn's numbers.
~~Lots of theorycrafting here, I have a specific mechanic in mind that would be utterly unexpected and highly effective. I'm actually really excited about this. I had some really annoying run ins as Quinn with an AI Alistar. When I'd try to Vault onto or next to him, the broken instant computer reflexes would knock me up before I got to him. The reason I mention that is Karma's E. If you can use the shield while Quinn is jumping, I cannot think of any better ranged champion or ability to combine with Karma's shield than Quinn's Vault. Quinn jumps in while Karma send out AOE burst, WHILE protecting any retaliation WHILE helping Quinn escape from the engage speed. It's too perfect. Seriously, I need to try this out. Overall I think Quinn and Karma would have really good trading potential and Quinn benefits from Karma's aggressive playstyle. Karma can set up Quinn's blind skillshot, can(?) pull off abnormal burst with a Vault shield, nope. That's it. Perfect combo. No competition. Karma's shield wants a melee champion to best synergize

EDIT: More thoughts on Quinn. It seems like Quinn is considered to be a little underpowered right now. I agree that the concept of Quinn + Karma's quick engage and disengage could be a good combo

Quinn EDIT#2: Rewriting of Quinn's section to better reflect how she realistically performs.

EDIT: New lane partner.

- Urgot: *no personal experience* [2-3?] - /u/YUSoTanky mentioned Urgot as a possible lane partner. Karma might be good considering how much Urgot wants to lock down his opponent in a fight

I wish I could to be able to add thoughts about countering and add the rest of the ADC's to my list, I would love to add your thoughts to my main post.

**tl;dr Thoughts about Karma and information about what she can do. Potential good candidates for duo support. **

I'm really looking forward to feedback from you guys to see how I line up with your thoughts about Karma

EDIT2: My general criticism comes from the perception that all of my information is based on bot games. It was a bot game that got me thinking, I feel like I need to change the tone of my post to a little less optimistic stance, as I put too much emphasis on Karma's CC. It's not very reliable and not extremely effective. That being said, I think it still has potential and can make plays. Also, my love for the Quinn/Karma matchup is diminished. After some discussion, Quinn's numbers don't really seem to add up to the potential of other ADC's. I knew she wasn't a ""normal"" pick, but hadn't realized that she was considered to be a little UP.

I've been thinking a lot about the community in LoL, what with the Tribunal and everything doing its job.  

That being said however

* It allowed positive members of the community to be recognized both by the company and by the rest of the community as being great people to be around.
* PMods were given the ability (and responsibility) to temporarily mute or temporarily ban other players for particularly egregious behavior.
* PMods could also immediately escalate particularly severe cases directly to JaGeX's Player Support/Community Management team.

The PMods were **volunteers** hand-picked by JaGeX for responsibility and kindness

The reason I bring all this up is that I feel a system like this could work extremely well for League of Legends.  A lot of the concepts in FunOrb are relatively similar to LoL

* I do NOT think this should be based on Honor.  The Honor system is decently accurate
* I am suggesting this under the assumption that Riot picks PMods well and makes sure they do not abuse their power.  Please don't fill the comments with ""ehrmagerd but mr t pmods will just mute everyone they dont like"" because SHH!
* This is also under the assumption this system already exists and all of the infrastructure is in place.  I realize this would be difficult to implement
* Last but not least

Right

* PMods are required to send a warning to the player in question before taking any action.  This warning would entail either a message in their chat window or some sort of other UI interaction.
* If the player accepts the warning and stops the toxic behavior
* If the player does NOT accept the warning
* In addition

Now then

* Should these PMods have some sort of an identifying marker similar to how the Honor Crests are displayed?
* Would a system like this get in the way of gameplay in any way?  If so how?
* Should the warning be labeled as from the PMod's player name or a global ""Server: Warning"" sort of dealio?

**TL;DR - I am suggesting a Player Moderator system where Riot picks extremely positive players from the community to both be recognized as such and have the ability to keep some of the more egregious cases out of your games.  The goal would roughly be to make PMods a near-instant front line arm of the Tribunal.  THIS IS ALL THEORETICAL!**

Now then

Thanks for reading
Eagle

**EDIT:** OK so I'm going to make an edit here I feel is **REALLY** important.  If PMods are not identified as such it'd be extremely easy for average players or trolls to impersonate a PMod and scare the other players into submission.  This would be a HUGE problem in my opinion,False,,t5_2wenn,1374727278.0,,,t3_1ixq7y

Now

Now, during this discussion, the relevance of LoLKing stats came into question.

I think everybody here knows that win, a middling champion can have a high winrate because the champion is infrequently picked, and when it is picked it is picked by players that play it relatively well. 

Now, I see a few people who, I assume, are trying to be heroes of reason, saying that solo queue win rates are irrelevant when discussing balance. The most recent reason cited to me is that the ""vast majority of players ... are not playing the game to even 60% of its potential."" 

Disregarding the arbitrary 60% in there, most players will never make it past silver. 

However, you can't just buff it because it might have negative repercussions regarding the LCS competitive field.

[Part2](http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1bu5ph/eu_lcs_week_8_day_1_thoughts_from_an_analytic/)

My previous two posts have analyzed the performances of SK Gaming, and Gambit. Now, to talk about Giants, Wolves, DragonBorns, and aAa - their games today, and how important their games tomorrow are.

**Wolves beat Giants**

This was a huge win for the Wolves, it was a surrender. Exter was the only player on the Giants with kills at the end of the game. 

On paper it looked fine, and Danish. Couple that with Thresh's hard CC and Graves's pure damage, and you have one scary team! Not to mention Shen... Whose global threat of just coming out of the blue is so crucial...

Svenskeren became a monster early game, Cataclysm, The Box... Wolves pulled out all the stops, and Giants looked lost. They looked shell shocked, as if they didn't know what to do. Babeta had Zyra but it didn't matter. Wolves dominated early, kept it going, and defeated the Giants.

Looking to tomorrow

Giants face aAa and then SK. aAa looked very strong over DB today, they might get themselves together to play SK. SK, though, seem to be motivated, so I don't think that they'll win that game.

Expect Wolves over DB but losing to Gambit. Expect Giants to drop both games against aAa and SK. Why? Let me tell you...

**This Dioud is the Real Deal**

Yes

It is true that Against All Authority played a very struggling DragonBorns team. However, but it wasn't a great performance. Hosan seems to be the only aggressive one on the team while the rest of the team was caught out over and over again. It did not help that Shlaya's Lux was on key. 

Against All Authority still has a little hope left. If they can defeat Giants, which will be a very stout test. If aAa, with their new Dioud, can defeat Giants and Fnatic? Then they might actually be able to matter a bit more in the last few weeks of this very turbulent season.

DragonBorns, their season seems lost. It will be up to them to keep motivated and keep hoping. They need to remember that they can still qualify for the Summer Season by winning through the Promotion/Relegation tournament, so it's imperative to try to keep getting better despite the negative results. Facing adversity and persevering is one of the hardest things to do, but it is what they must do.

aAa faces Giants while DB faces Wolves. Then, it's the Wolves and the Evil Geniuses. Wolves are looking for a big win to cement their fifth place standing, while EG wants to forget the taste of defeat they experienced today.

More drama will come. Who will prevail?

**Miscellaneous Notes**

I actually took the time to watch most of the NA LCS matches this week, while Stvicious and TheOddOne, along with Lautemortis, are very capable junglers. Wildturtle is America's Hosan in a sense, and Voyboy and Dyrus can deal with the best of them.

I still like the EU scene a bit better

It's nicer, charming, and well-informed as Sjokz. Coupled with her and the analysts having a guest from a team or the Riot community? Nothing beats that. (In my opinion).

I'll write sometime next week about the matches tomorrow and the matches that await us next week. Thanks for reading

the ongoing Chinese LPL has insert a new individual ranking system called MVP rating ranking. Each match

And all the points will add together from these 5 groups (means a single player can get up to 150 points in a single game if hes from the winning team and also get picked by all 5 groups of experts as 1nd choise MVP). After that

then it come to the most important last paragraph:

目前直播中的MVP值评分并没有加入玩家们的参与环节，不过每周之星的投票应该会对选手们入选MVP阵容有很大的加分，所以，千万不要忘记前往LPL专题为你心中的MVP投上一票哦！

the current MVP rating has not included any factor from viewers and fans


Hence that based on the current MVP rating (which i m still searching for any source that has the correct mvp rating ranking

1362730323.0,19wi1i,Recommended items for Lissandra and Zac released on PBE,hatten,13,3,19,"http://www.surrenderat20.net/2013/03/lissandra-mentioned-in-36-pbe-game-files.html

In my opinion:
Lissandra looks to be your average damage caster
Zac looks to be a tanky ap jungler, being recommended Spirit Of the Spectral wraith. Likely to use mana due to spirit stone, and might have some form of innate lifesteal/heal/spell vamp seeing as he's recommended spirit visage.


Does anybody else have speculations what they are gonna be? I rarely play any of these types of characters so don't keep track of their recommended items,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,mrn,t3_19wi1i
1362677630.0,19usob,"A Theory Craft of an Interesting Sort- ""Tanking without tank"" by iPandaN",iPandaN,16,6,23,"**Intro:**

Hey guys, like my last post, this composition is extemely niche in countering comps with scary damage/AoE.


**The Composition:**

-AP Galio
-AP Maokai Jungle
-Katarina
-Soraka
-Urgot

**The Theorycraft:**

So this composition may seem silly at first with it's gimmicky bot lane

-Soraka and Urgot will be spamming their Q's in teamfights. Every 5 spellcasts near Maokai will heal him for 7% of his maximum health. The regeneration potential for Maokai is insane without even accounting any other spell 
casts.

-His ulti will make his team take 20% reduced damage in teamfights

-Soraka can silence an enemy that would otherwise disrupt galio's ultimate.

-Urgot will be building Runaan's Hurricane, as i don't see why it wouldn't otherwise). This is rediculous.

So at it's core, and emphasizing debuffs and auras, that are not effected by penetration (Urgot/Maokai). The new emphasis on penetration has made stacking Armor/MR not so effective, but penetration doesn't apply to these artificial means of damage mitigation. It seems to me that this has some potential. So if they're grouped up, in total you have: 

-AS reduction (FH on Urgot)
-MR Reduction (Soraka Q
-Armor Reduction (Urgot E
-Damage Output Reduction (Urgot)
-AoE, Root, Silence, Surpess
-That Soraka Ultimate

You have so much damage and effective tankiness on all of your champions that it's hard to decide who to focus, a defensive steroid, OP heals, and damage reduction on the scary targets that are trying to pick off whichever champion.

**Urgot's Build:**

-Tier 2 Boots (There are lots of viable options)

-Trinity Force (Sheen Procs/AoE slow combined with W AA's between Q's for AoE dmg)

-BotRK

-Runaan's

-Black Cleaver

-Frozen Heart


With this you debuff 3 people to full BC stacks in 2 Auto Attacks.

1362560377.0,19rmhj,Double Lizard Action,Haekos,13,4,25,"A friend of mine just thought of builing Spirit of the Elder Lizard on Renekton. I didn't know the item that much and thought it would be useless unless you were a jungler but in my opinion it turns out to be quite an interesting idea. Not necessarily op but at least a bit creative.

------------------------

**Total Cost: 2300g**

 Spirit Stone (700g) *(Hunter's Machete (300g) + Faerie Charm (180g) + Rejuvenation Bead (180g) + 40g)*

 Pickaxe (875g)
  
  725g

**Stats:**
 
+50 attack damage

+14 health regen

+7 mana regen

+10% cooldown reduction
	
**Unique Passive:** 

*Butcher:* Damage dealt to neutral monsters increased by 25%.

**Unique Passive :**

*Incinerate:* Basic attacks and spells that do not inflict damage-over time deal 14-50 (based on level) bonus true damage over 3 seconds on hit.

-----------------

Actually this item synergizes quite well with Renekton ult + a sunfire cape

In fact the biggest problem here would be the building path. Machete will be useless since you're gonna be laning. Not even talking about fairy charm. So in the end, is it really worth building it ?

It may not be OP and I'm not that good of a top laner but on paper it doesn't seem that terrible to me

I understand Varus's key weakness is not have any type of escape

IMO, that is 30% max health just from blight stacks in ~4 seconds not counting the auto attacks and ability damage. Not the mention the blight stacks do magic damage which most tops and junglers don't prioritize MR over armor. 

He also has a great CC ulti that if used correctly can lock up at least 2 people for 2 seconds each. Plus

Finally adding in the changes to BotRK which does another 15% max health damage

Just wondering if I am missing something or just being naive. Anyone else have any opinions on why Varus isn't played more?",,t5_2wenn,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/19haqz/varus_viability/

1375060970.0,1j8xpe,"After 7 weeks a total of 86 champions have been picked in EU and NA LCS, will there be more?",trphyhntr,10,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1j8xpe/after_7_weeks_a_total_of_86_champions_have_been/, Talon and Vi played in Europe.


The Gragas pick is perhaps not a huge surprise considering it's not an entirely uncommon pick in Chinese and Korean pro leagues the other champions though haven't seen almost any play time this summer  (Corki was played once in NA and once in Korea i believe).


The 7th week in the North American LCS was less eventful in terms of new champions being played - the only one previously unseen was Aatrox who Kiwikid from Dignitas played twice during the week.



The fact that just two weeks before the start of play-offs it appears teams are not afraid to bring out new picks raises the question what other unconventional champions we could see before the standings for play-offs are locked. The subject seemed interesting so i decided to take a closer look.


So far the European Season has seen 77 different champions and the 37 that are yet to see any play-time are:



Akali|Alistar|Amumu|Brand|Cassiopeia|Cho'Gath
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:

Poppy|Rammus |Riven|Shaco|Shyvana|Sion
Soraka|Swain|Taric|Teemo|Trundle|Tryndamere
Urgot|Veigar|Viktor|Warwick|Wukong|Yoirck
Ziggs



The NA LCS has seen a total of 70 different champions in the 80 games played so far and the 44 that are still yet to be played are:
*edit : There are 4 champions that were counted towards the 70 that were banned in games

Skarner|Soraka|Swain|Syndra|Talon|Taric
Teemo|Udyr|Veigar|Vi|Viktor|Volibear
Warwick|Wukong




There are some differences



There are just two weeks left in the regular season
32 games are just a little less than a third of a season though so there are plenty of opportunities for teams to bring out new picks to surprise their opponents and through that try secure their spots in the play-offs.



Which previously unplayed champions do you think will get picked in the last two weeks of the regular season? Or has the viable champion pool been completely exhausted with the new picks in week 7? The Spring Split regular season saw 86 different champions in NA and 81 in Europe,False,,t5_2wenn,1375103053.0,,,t3_1j8xpe

**What do I mean by Champion Synergy?**: I've been counting the number of games played and wins of each individual champion *WITH* every other champion they've played with (not against) in those matches. (You can look that in Sheet #2, simply look for your champion on any row/column and then look for another champion in the opposite side).


**Why does it say patch 3.8 in the title?**: Well, and I really didn't feel like mixing them up, so... yeah that's pretty much it!

**Week 8 Matches Day 1 Preview**

Did EU LCS do this on purpose? We have games that pit #1 vs. #2, and #7 vs. #8 this week. That is just... CREEPY! Anyway, on to the matches, which are going to be EPIC!

*Match 1: SK Gaming (11-8) vs. Fnatic (15-3) Saturday 2:00 PM CEST 5:00 AM PDT*

Season Series: Fnatic 2:0 SK Gaming

The Showdown: 

Fnatic vs. SK. I'm sure by now casters and players could write a book on the history between these two rivals. From IEM Katowice (xPeke's epic backdoor) to the two wins in the LCS for Fnatic, with one more win than EG; A loss here coupled with another loss against EG would drop them to fourth place for certain. Fnatic, on the other hand, wishes to keep the pressure on SK and win another game to cement their lead on top of the standings over Gambit Gaming. 

The Strategies:

Fnatic is known as the split-pushing team. According to EG's Krepo and SK's Ocelote, they have their opponents scurrying for cover. In contrast, SK is all about winning the side lanes and then winning big engagements. Ocelote will actually miss out on farm to go help his teammates by ganking either top or bot, giving SK another presence along with hyrqbot. Another thing to note is that neither of these teams do crazy lane swaps; if they do lane swaps at all, they will just flip top and bot, instead of putting the AD and Support in mid like Dignitas in NA.

Key Matchup:

xPeke vs. Ocelote. What Ocelote must do to help SK win this game is shut xPeke down. xPeke's play is such that once he gets a Lich Bane on TF, he split-pushes. Then, Cyanide, Yellowstar and nRated hold the middle while xPeke and sOAZ apply so much pressure that the opposing team has to deal with them. Then, they back off and go get big objectives like turrets or dragon. 

Although Ocelote's playstyle usually has to do with roaming lanes to help his teammates

For Fnatic, and nRated can hold the middle while xPeke and sOAZ are ideally split-pushing. I believe that those three don't get enough credit. Split-pushing doesn't work if you lose objectives in the middle that comes from the opposing team. Cyanide, Yellowstar, and nRated have held the ground while the split push goes on. This is why Cyanide always goes for a hard CC/Clearing Champion like Nasus or Kayle, and why Yellowstar likes Varus so much due to the Arrows. 

My Prediction: Fnatic

It should be another great game between these two rivals. It's the start of a crucial couple games for SK

*Match 2: Gambit Gaming (13-4) vs. Evil Geniuses (10-8) Saturday 3:00 PM CEST 6:00 AM PDT*

Season Series: Tied

The Showdown: 

Another team that is looking to make a move this week is the Evil Geniuses, EG needs to seize the moment, and the moment is now. Gambit, on the other hand, want to keep a grip on their Top 2 spot and perhaps regain the top place by the end of the weekend, with a game against Fnatic coming up. 

The Strategies:

Nobody quite knows what kind of team EG is at the moment. At times, and Wickd's edge in the top lane always gives them an edge; Snoopeh is a solid jungler and Yellowpete/Krepo are a very competent duo. However, recently, they have learned the teams can use early aggression on them to shut down their game before the late game happens. We saw a glimpse of what the new EG could be in EG's win against GIANTS in Week 6. Sure, GIANTS were penalized two bans, and EG was allowed to have Froggen on Anivia and Krepo on Thresh, but EG played a smart

Gambit, team fighting team. They have the longest continuous lineup, and the fact that they are all Russian means that language is not an issue. They seem to communicate flawlessly, and know exactly where to push to get what they want when they want it. There simply isn't a team that plays better in team fights 5v5 or even 4v5 than Gambit. They might lose the early game, but one team fight win in mid or late game can cause such a devastating snowball effect, and when that one battle comes through, Gambit's stranglehold is so strong that they rarely drop games at the end.

Key Matchup:

Krepo vs. Edward. These two are the top two Supports in the EU All Star voting for a reason. They are pretty much incredible. I promise you, they are both either ""skumbag"" or ""kill-securers"". The thing that most people don't know, however, is that the way that these supports play actually works in their overall plan. Both Gambit and EG are mid to late game oriented teams with a heavy emphasis on winning that one team fight to turn the entire game. That means that supports getting kills is not bad at all, as the more gold a support has, the more team fight oriented items they can purchase to help their team in the long run. So, although some might say that Edward and Krepo take too much

Who knows how many kills Genja and Yellowpete will ""assist"" these two in. But one thing is for certain - with Krepo and Edward, and although Snoopeh and Diamondprox will buy their share as well, what Krepo and Edward are wearing when the big fight comes will have a huge impact on this game.

A sidenote on Froggen vs. Alex Ich: I'm not sure if they'll be allowed to face each other, in my opinion, solely responsible for bringing the AD Bruiser mid-lane into the EU LCS scene with his Zed play; Froggen's Lux, Anivia, and even Cassiopeia are amazing. EG has historically excelled when Froggen plays well, and the same goes for Gambit and Alex Ich. Although, I want to say that Froggen matters a little more because I have seen Diamond take over games before

My Prediction: Gambit

Sorry for EG fans, the only team that can beat Gambit at the moment in the EU scene is indeed Fnatic. EG will give Gambit a good fight, but the cohesion that Gambit has will prevail in the end over Evil Geniuses. One thing I am certain of? The probability of this game hanging on one team fight is extremely high.

*Match 3: GIANTS! (6-11) vs. Copenhagen Wolves (7-13) Saturday 4:00 PM CEST 7:00 AM PDT*

Season Series: Tied

The Showdown: #5 vs. #6. Raise your hand if you thought at the beginning of the season, me neither. These two teams have been spectacular the last few weeks. Bjergsen and Exter have been the life of their respective teams, leading them to upset victories time and time again. As these two teams fight for the right to face either SK or EG and stay ahead of aAa and DB, it is good to note that they can still mathematically catch EG and SK if they win enough games. On the flip side, they could still end up in the bottom two if they lose enough games. Hence, this clash is actually very important, and the play of Exter and Bjergsen as well as the improved play of these teams as a whole presents an intriguing matchup.

The Strategies:

GIANTS and the Wolves are two very similar teams

These teams tend to play lanes, get big items, then roam to kill. They both have had issues in the past with closing out games and letting teams get back into a game that was firmly in their control. Vision has also been an issue for both teams as it seems that at times they don't have enough wards on the map.

Of course, although not as widely recognized by the community as Ocelote, xPeke, Froggen, or Alex Ich, are definitely very important to the performance of their teams.

Key Matchup:

Svenskeren vs. Morden. What? You might say. Didn't I just spend so much time rambling on about how Exter and Bjergsen are so key? Yes, who has the biggest impact on how a team's mid laner does? The opposing team's jungler. Svenskeren's play, especially on Jarvan, has picked up immensely. Morden hasn't been spectacular, but solid nonetheless. It will be on these two to gank the other mid-laner successfully, and whomever gets their mid laner rolling first will contribute the most to their team. Of course, the mid laners could kill each other, but the jungler matchup stands out here due to how fast Exter and Bjergsen can pick up the slightest lead and change it to domination.

Honorable Mention: Samux vs. Godbro

Both Samux's Rumble play and Godbro's Shen/Singed play have been impressive lately. With their mid laners getting all the attention

My Prediction: Toss Up.

I can't pick. Sorry. Right now, but that's only if Babeta can get his hands on Zyra, which is highly unlikely as well. They are definitely teams on the rise, teams that have figured out what they were doing wrong and fixed them. A win here would catapult either team to be a legitimate threat to whomever loses the SK vs. EG game... Expect drama.

First looking at the mastery points

The 5 in offense gives

-2% increased damage

-3 flat ad


The 5 in utility gives

-3% lifesteal / spellvamp

-3% movespeed

-Either 3 gold for auto attacking champs or explorer ward or 1.25% exp



Between quints


-4.5% movespeed

-6% lifesteal 

-7.7 arp

-6.75 flat ad


Now most of the time the choice is between movespeed and flat ad for adcs. I say that with the utility spec choice, with the dorans blae attack damage, last hitting is still easy, and your trading power is intense. Any thoughts?

So to recap

14/0/16 blade and ad quints vs 9/0/21 with blade and lifesteal quints

14/0/16 has a 9.75 ad, 3% movespeed, 3 gold per champ auto advantage


14/0/16 blade and ms quints vs 9/0/21 blade and lifesteal quints

With the new Bork being overpowered, this is even more going into the full bruiser comp.

But of course

But isn't it the same for a Nunu+Vayne type of botlane? Whenever vayne is last hitting a caster minion, and if she trades back, cait can count on soraka's help. Hence, pros came up with the switch lane solution. Switch your weak botlane to top and shut down their toplane.

Now that seems a good solution for a double bruiser lane. Get two bruisers to toplane, because of the same switch-lanes-kill-turrets Korean meta).

Another advantage of this kind of comp is the permutability of the three bruisers. Whenever the botlane solo feels like backing, or the one that can buy a decisive small item to counter the botlane (first to reach tabi-dorans, first to reach cloth+philo, etc.). If the opponent decides to switch back lanes, no worries, you do the same. But you only send one bruiser to botlane, while they had to switch three people. This is more xp and gold for two ppl.

Part 3 examines the third and final game of the series.

**[Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1e467n/dignitas_teamfighting_analysis_part_1/)**

**[Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1e4zmb/dignitas_teamfighting_analysis_part_2/)**

___
###I. Teamfight 7 [21:50-22:22]

**Analysis:**

###[[Images]Teamfight Breakdown &amp; Analysis](http://imgur.com/a/00la9#0)

**Key Factors:**

* **DIG caught GGU at the choke.** Capitalizing on GGU's unforced mistake

* **DIG knew when to retreat and punished Twitch's flank attempt.** Instead of focusing all their attention forward, while the carries mobbed Twitch while he was out of position.

___
###II. Teamfight 8 [24:13-24:29]

**Analysis:**

###[[Images]Teamfight Breakdown &amp; Analysis](http://imgur.com/a/XJQ8j#0)

**Key Factors:**

* **DIG did not realize the terrain situation with respect each team's team compositions.** What would have been an excellent initiation in many situations turned out to be a critical mistake

___
###III. Teamfight 9 [30:36-31:01]

**Analysis:**

###[[Images]Teamfight Breakdown &amp; Analysis](http://imgur.com/a/v5fRd#0)

**Key Factors:**

* **Jarvan initiated onto low priority targets.** Despite the numbers advantage

* **Jarvan initiated too early.** Too focused on using their numbers advantage, forcing them to group up, which likely made them more inclined to all-in focus the closest target, Nasus.

* **DIG zoned in too hard onto Nasus.** This further clumped them up

___
###IV. Teamfight 10 [38:37-39:16]

**Analysis:**

###[[Images]Teamfight Breakdown &amp; Analysis](http://imgur.com/a/hoKpP#0)

**Key Factors:**

* **Renekton prioritized the wrong target.** Though Nasus was closer, with proper caution.

* **Renekton committed too deep.** Feeling overly powerful as he was just coming into the fight, and GGU had a strong advantage at this point.

* **DIG miscommunicated.** The rest of DIG was retreating as Renekton dashed forward

___
###V. Teamfight 11 [46:20-46:44]

**Analysis:**

###[[Images]Teamfight Breakdown &amp; Analysis](http://imgur.com/a/RXVAa#0)

**Key Factors:**

* **Jarvan initiated too far in front of his team.** Though there was little chance of coming back

___
###VI. Conclusions From Game 3

Outside of teamfight 7, ignoring the disadvantageous factors. It was also clear in DIG's overcommitment onto Nasus in teamfight 9 and Renekton's in teamfight 10.

A positive trend DIG displayed was an ability to recognize choke point vulnerabilities

___
###VII. Final Summary

**Scouting Report**

Team Dignitas' main flaw in teamfighting lies in their one-dimensional

*Initiation*

Dignitas is often too focused on taking advantage of a single favorable factor

*Positioning*

In direct teamfights, but as they move forward, their positioning often falters, showing little ability to transition. Dignitas often clumps up as they all press toward a target, making them highly susceptible to AOE. The tank lines are typically well maintained toward a single front, but paths to the back line are available from the flanks.

*Targeting*

Dignitas picks the correct initial target for the most part, the best option is to drop focus all together and retreat, which they fail to realize immediately in more complex situations. Dignitas is typically on the same page with regards to their focus, though they are not immune to miscommunication.

*Terrain*

Dignitas seems to recognize the vulnerabilities created when moving through choke points, clumping up for little or no reason.

**Playing Against Dignitas**

Opposing teams should focus heavily on their positioning in order to take advantage of Dignitas' teamfighting flaws. Teams should concentrate on maintaining a spread formation that can be transitioned into and out of easily, this will allow other teammates to take advantage as holes in Dignitas' positioning open up.

I don't think so. I don't have the vods on hand right now (this is a rushed post, Fnatic, and Team Solomid can't even attempt to claim. Not only that, but they've also been doing some pretty radical things--in the final match of the season against the Saigon Fantastic Five, every single member on that team save the support built one of the items from spirit stone--notably Spirit of the Lizard Elder on 3/4 (Jayce, Kha'Zix, and the Adc who I am woefully forgetting), and other ones not yet witnessed on the other scene

Likewise, have also done fantastic this season with their adc Archie performing spectacularly. And this doesn't even cover the amazing play by the Singapore Sentinels who finished second at 22-6, or any of the other fantastic teams in the GPL.

ADC - Bebe

Jungle - Lilballz

APC - Chawy

These three are clearly the best in these roles in SEA

* Maybe Chawy is a little controversial, **and** the Allstars have about a month to figure everthing out. Particularly as Chawy's work ethic is prolly the most sexy thing about him h4h4. I have no idea why he was entered as an ADC instead of his much better APC, and am quite disappointed that he was picked due to the rule about regions over the very gifted Bebe.
* Harleluyar is definitely a great jungler

Top - Stanley (dark horse Tofuboi

* I actually prefer Tofuboi in this lane because he usually just rapes the lane. Hard. Even when ganked all day. But Stanley is more consistent and less of a lone wolf than Tofu. 
* SAJ are generally underrated

Support - d4rkness (also Mistake)

* Taking d4rkness in this role because of Stanley at top and region limitations

1364494872.0,1b6wai,Damage multiplier vs effective health. Which number matters?,osqer,10,2,9,"For each additional point of resistance

DM= 100/(100+ resistance)

From 0 armor to 1 armor you will see that I attain a 0.99 DM. Compared to 0 armor which gives me a 1.00 DM, at lower armor levels each armor point gives you a greater marginal % reduction in damage than at higher armor levels.

Lets set up damage to kill you like a distance forumula: D=RT, and T= effective damage. You will see that the effective damage to kill you = health/DM. From this perspective you will see that each armor point will marginally increase the effective damage to kill you by less and less, indicating diminishing returns.

***

Now let's look at effective health.

For each resistance point you gain a CONSTANT 1% increase of health effective health against physical or magic damage depending on which resistance you get

The damage to kill you would then be Health*(1+ (Resistance/100)

So two ways calculating Effective health:

1. Health/DM or Health/(1-%damage reduction) or substitute in for DM to get a third convoluted equation.

2. Health*(1+ (Resistance/100)

One indicates diminishing returns and the other indicates constant returns. I've slept on this for many weeks

Here are links to [NA Player](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/19c6pn/just_in_time_for_super_week_na_lcs_player/)

**Champion Statistics** 58 Champions have been picked (Zed and Leblanc have been banned but not picked)

**Top Champion Performances**

* Malphite and Singed have a 100% win rate and have been played in 5 games.  This is the longest 100% win rate in NA LCS.  Malphite has the 5th Highest KDA while Singed is only 23rd.
* Miss Fortune
* Alistar has the highest KDA of champions with a a decent amount of picks.  In 9 picks he has maintained a 78% win rate and the 3rd highest KDA overall (9.5) 
* Far more impressive than her EU performance
* Top KDA in NA goes to Draven

**Worst Champion Performances**

* Graves has yet to win a game despite being played 4 times.  He has managed to earn a KDA that is right in the middle of the pack (3.6)
* In Shen's 7 trips to summoners rift he has only won a single match. He has been played by 5 of the 8 Lcs teams.  Furthermore
*  Overall there are 17 Champions in the NA LCS with a 0% win rate.  This is nearly double the amount of champions with a 0% win rate in the EU LCS.

**Most Desired Champions** (Popularity=(Picks+Bans)/#of Games Available)

* Unsurprisingly Xin Zhao
* Noone else comes close to their popularity but Nidalee
* Shen appears on the worst Champion performances and the most desired champions list

**Least Desired Champions**

There are about a dozen champions with very very small popularity with 1 or 2 picks or bans.  In NA most of these low picks have a 0% win rate..

* Tristana may be an undervauled pick.  She is 2-0 with the 4th Highest KDA. Her wins have also come on 2 different teams.  It will be interesting to see if any other teams give this Yordle a try.
* In 24 games Karthus has only made 1 appearance

**Odds and Ends**

* Vi has the 21st Highest Win Rate (57%) and 9th Lowest KDA
* Thresh has 100% Popularity in EU but only 37% in NA
* Bans have not seen any major shifts besides Olaf who was banned in 6 out of the first 8 games and has not been banned since being nerfed.  Xin Zhao who was not banned in the first 6 games seems to have taken his place as a must ban.
* In all 3 of the longest victories the winners ADC was an Ezreal

1374937289.0,1j5uip,Support trends in terms of runes with a little math,frdrk,8,3,22,"Greetings summoners.

The last time you saw me post on r/summoners

*Circumstances surrounding this trend:*

* Passive gold got increased in season 3
* People kill more towers
* The gold influx pressure to drop wards decreased with Sightstone
* Bottom lane got more aggressive

I've mostly been looking at Korean supports, AD quints, AP quints or, a new twist (for me): MPen.

The magic pen choice is a likely consequence of a trend in the last couple of months where bottom lane has been running increasing amounts of non-MR glyphs. Feel around with lolnexus during your soloqueue games to get an idea about the general rune choices of your opponents.

Random general facts to support your choices:

* **Sightstone first**
* Running no gp10 quints compared to 3 will delay your Sightstone by slightly more than 1 minute.
* Running 1 gp10 quint compared to 3 still gets Sightstone in the same game minute interval (between ~08:30 and 09:30)

* **Philostone first**
* Running no gp10 quints compared to 3 will delay your Philostone by pretty much exactly 1 minute.
* Running 1 gp10 quint compared to 3 still gets Sightstone in the same game minute interval (between ~06:30 and 07:30)

Let research strengthen your decisions and may we be better players for it!

Did anyone actually thought the game was well played?

Read that carefully, but anyone actually believes the teams played well? Hell, even decently?

I'm really curious here

TSM (or at least Dyrus and Reginald, Dyrus going for the most idiotic 1v1s against Elise despite being severely behind, not defending the top inib tower and wasting time mid despite his team having far superior wave clear and, in the end, taking part in the most ridiculous ""base-race"" call I remember to date; on the other hand, Reginal too kept going for the most senseless 1v1s against Link, often wasting his Requim (a teamfight changing ultimate) just to get Link or pop a GA.

TSM played truly bad for their standards and there must be some internal issues with that team.

Meanwhile, like not stopping Nien from getting 3 freaking inibs.

Some might argue that this was the match of the year for the NA LCS, or pretty much any other decent Asian League, while, unfortunately, they're far from being a rarity in the Western Leagues.

eFlux is an organization that runs competitive arenas for League of Legends and DOTA 2. The arenas function somewhat like a sports league. Team owners are selected by the staff and they are in charge of their teams for the season. It is their duty to scout players  in preparation for the draft. When the draft occurs

After the draft, we will be doing an on-stream interview/AMA for James and Dan, the leaders of eFlux at 9 PM EST.

**What are Scouting Lobbies?**
Scouting lobbies are custom games played on Summoner's Rift using Draft Mode. It is in these games that players aspiring to be drafted play to show off their talent to team owners. The game name and password will be given on stream and in our in-game ""eFlux"" Chat Room. The first 10 players in will participate. These lobbies will be casted and recorded for owners to review and for you and your friends to watch live. You do not have to be currently signed up to participate!

**How do I participate in Scouting Lobbies?**
In order to participate you can follow these easy steps!

My personal opinion is no change of teams in NA and MYM will go up in Europe.


I also think if the above result holds true it will be the last time we see a change of teams in either region for a very long time.  The teams in LCS will replace a weak member here and there with the best of the rest and there won't be enough talent in the non-LCS teams to compete with the salary teams and the huge experience/practice advantage they have.  Unless burnout among players becomes more common I don't see any amateur team being able to break through after this unless somebody gathers up the very best non-LCS players and they all go to Asia for a month or two and train up which would be very unlikely.

Will it be a healthy situation to basically have the same 8 teams locked into LCS in NA and EU if it turns out that way?  Is 8 teams enough,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,we,t3_1csagx

I've made a post recently about a specific way I began to approach bot lane. The path was deigned for specific advantage gained at level 1, the trade offs and the challenges.

But in the back of my mind I kept thinking the same thing

The basic idea is if you are not making your enemies life miserable, and expect that to be a large enough factor to lead to victory, it's a contribution, but hardly justification for the actual outcome.

I find it interesting that this is not a widely accepted view yet. Doing well in one game is not reason to climb elo, because you will end up merely ""winning lane"" by a few cs and maybe 1 or 2 kills.

A perfect example of this ""I must crush"" mentality is Best Riven NA. He picked a champion that has an early advantage, but even if he ensures that he wins 50% of the game for sure, the other 50% may be an even split, and he ends up at 75% win ratio overall :)

So don't be afraid of all-in strategies, you are likely getting carried by someone** and that's no way to win.",,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,

1362890079.0,1a0c2p,Why are good champions underplayed?,freeogy,19,14,48,"I was sifting through Xypherous's recent posts when I wandered into a seemingly innocuous thread complaining that Varus was underplayed because he's underpowered. Obviously, a fun playstyle

As I'm sitting here thinking about how silly this guy is to think that Varus is UP, and play it nearly every game (as you can imagine, I don't have to fight for that role often), I feel like I have a pretty firm grasp in my head of how often I see certain carries and supports. I double checked, and sure enough, Varus is among one of the least played ADCs in the game, clocking in just above Ashe, but despite the fact that he's played in duo lanes, too.

But, Sivir, and Ashe, their lack of appearances have reasons I can understand. Even if I might disagree about *how* weak they are (For instance, I don't think that Corki is a disaster like some people think; the TF nerfs just hit him harder than others, and old nerfs finally caught up. It's still very easy to outplay people with Corki, though.), in fact, say

But Varus is competitive with the most picked ADCs in the game. Why don't people pick him? He's no more difficult than Graves, he does have a much more useful ult. Yet Graves is picked in nearly twice as many games.

The only thing I can think of is that he has a pretty bad winrate in the professional scene. But he still gets picked. I dunno. And there are other champions out there like him. What's the deal?

I go to a twitch stream and starts to watch a game that has been going on a while. I then I notice that the spectator mode interface cant tell me how the game ended up the way it did. For that I would like this changes:

* I would like to see dragons and barons killed. Maybe even blue
* % difference on gold would be nice (hover over for exact amount)

Other suggestions for the spectator mode:

* I would also like to se gold spent on consumables in the gold tab. 
* Time left till objective re-spawn (including inhibitor)
* One bigger thing is to make the bottom infobar bar wider. That would make room to see all player info in the bottom screen. (Remove the portraits on the side) That includes healthbars
* Replace the portraits on the left and right side with some menu for more statistics that the commentators can bring up. Like total difference in experience between teams.

What would you like to see?

- Weigh Markman deaths higher
- Gold and cs marksman weights higher
- Weigh top and jungle deaths lower (initiators)
- Remove support CSPM hit? (situational items need cs
- Lower support death weight

Some notes:

**Role Rating is supposed to be a measure of how much that player contributed to the team's overall performance, that doesn't mean he is a bad player - it just means he contributed less to the team's overall performance, which makes sense.

That being said, so it is our duty to make sure we make it as accurate as possible. 

There was also some discussion yesterday about weighing in wins and losses to the Role Rating. I want to be clear here: I totally disagree in ever linking those factors into a player's rating.

Season Series: 2-0 Against All Authority

The Showdown: The two bottom teams... Where they do not wish to be. Roster changes ensue. Karalius left aAa, and if they are to provide any kind of late season magic at all, they must start against each other, at the bottom.

The scary thing, two of the teams that will be in the Summer Promotion Playoffs, have shown this season. Neither DragonBorns or aAa want to be in that position to have to play for their spots in the League. It would be a shock to their ego as a player and to the organization as a whole.

The Strategies:

This game will present fireworks from start to finish. These teams are the most aggressive early game teams in the EU scene. ShLaYa has twice teleported and used a ward to set up first blood for his team. DragonBorns does insane switchups that leave lasting impact on the whole game, ten minute dragons, AP in bot, who knows what they'll show next? When teams are desperate, they'll try anything to win, and these two teams are VERY desperate.

Key Matchup: 

HosaN vs. Nono. Freddy122 gets a shoutout as one of my favorite players in the game for being able to mid sometimes in the place of ShLaYa when aAa sees fit, HosaN might be in a battle. What the aggressive styles of play does for both teams, though, is make the importance of Malunoo and Virtu4l even more crucial. One successful gank on an aggressive carry can win the lane, and winning lanes win games. 

My Prediction: aAa

Bring Malunoo back will provide better jungling for DB, and the possibility of Dioud being a better fit with Nono gives aAa a slight edge. With these two teams, though? Anything can happen, and that is what makes this game worth watching. 

*Match 5: SK Gaming (11-8) vs. Evil Geniuses (10-8) Saturday 6:00 PM CEST 9:00 AM PDT*

Season Series: Tied

The Showdown: Ah. After a game amongst the current 7-8 and the current 5-6 we have the current 3-4. Are you sure you didn't fix this, and now in this crucial moment of time they play each other. The Matchups are endless. Wickd vs. Kev1n. Froggen vs. Ocelote. Yellowpete vs. Candypanda. Krepo vs. Nyph. Snoopeh vs. hyrqbot. Want to call this one? Good luck! 

The Strategies: 

Two teams oriented around team fighting, looks to roam around to make plays while Froggen would rather farm up and get powerful. Nyph and Candypanda tend to be a little more passive than Krepo and Yellowpete, while hyrqbot would be a shoo-in for the All Star spot if it wasn't for Diamondprox. Unless Froggen does something like being Malphite again, or Ocelote does something like being Jarvan again, it should be one skill shot AP mid vs. another. Of course, they could follow the new Zed meta, which would be interesting

Key Matchup: 

Wickd vs. Kev1n. I doubt that they'll be allowed to go 1 vs 1 against each other, Renekton, Shen, Jayce... You name it. They always play solid, they always know when to back off and when to press, and they can be relied upon to perform. Snoopeh and hyrqbot will play a huge part on whichever gets pushed around, but don't be surprised if it takes another lane going down for one of these players to lose their lane.

My Prediction: Evil Geniuses

Another hard one to call, Ocelote's emotional nature can be good for the team at times, but sometimes what a team needs is stability of emotion to help performance. Froggen and EG tend to be more focused. As two teams that are looking for the next step to challenge the top 2 as well as avoid the surging Giants and Wolves, I would not count either of them out, but give the slight edge to Evil Geniuses.

*Match 6: Fnatic (15-3) vs. Gambit (13-4) Saturday 7:00 PM CEST 10:00 AM PDT*

Season Series: Gambit 2-1

The Showdown: And we conclude an epic day of matches with the big one: Fnatic vs. Gambit. Provided that Fnatic has handled SK and Gambit has handled EG, a Gambit win would almost close the gap while putting more distance between them and the winner of EG vs. SK. This game will be undoubtedly huge, and a great match indeed.

The Strategies: 

It is well known that this is the classic split-push vs. teamfight battle. Fnatic relies on speed and guerrilla warfare stretched across the map applying pressure everywhere while Gambit goes for objectives and teamfights. In their first game back in Week 1, saw Gambit build with team fighting in mind and win due to the strong front line of Shen and Nasus. Fnatic finally solved the riddle of Gambit by winning in Week 6 due to the split pushing of xPeke's Twisted Fate.

Genja, looking to land the perfect ult to help his team. Darien and Diamond play tanky champions, while Alex usually plays an assassin. With Edward and Diamond getting lots of team aura items, Gambit is a force to be reckoned with. In comparison, Fnatic values speed. xPeke always goes for champions with gap-closing or global presence ultimates while Cyanide goes for champions that have a targeted slow like Nasus or Kayle, to name a few. nRated likes Leona, Blitzcrank, while sOAZ plays the assassin champion that dives in and starts the chaos.

Basically, or the pushers get picked off, or Cyanide + nRated + Yellowstar cannot hold off the middle while the push is occurring, Gambit will prevail. The longer this game goes, the higher the risks will be for Fnatic to split push, but the higher the rewards will be as well if the pushing is effective. 

As an analyst, they will pick up their rivalry in the Summer Season.

Key Matchup:

sOAZ vs. Darien. Fnatic's split pushing, sOAZ has shown that he can indeed push the lanes as well, which has worked for Fnatic time and time again. More noteworthy is the fact that not only can he push, he knows precisely when to return to help Cyanide, Yellowstar, and nRated defend while xPeke is doing what Peke does. Having a team that split pushes requires a lot of communication and players being on the same page, and sOAZ is a testament to the Fnatic code.

Along the same lines is Darien, and Edward gobbling up all the attention. Darien might not be flashy, but he is reliable as Wickd or Kev1n, two top laners that are considered to be among the best in Europe. 

It will be up to Darien to either stop sOAZ from becoming powerful enough to split push or to deny Yellowstar from destroying his turret too quickly in the case of a lane swap. If there is one guy that can do that

These two teams are so evenly balanced

My Prediction: Fnatic

Fnatic is on a roll lately. The Russians are the only team to beat them twice this season, and it will give them victory once again.

&gt;Riot eSports Manager Matthew Marcou tweeting @SotLTravis during MLG Dallas

And how should the last spot be decided? A new tournament with the bottom 4 teams is the only fair way that occurs to me. ",,t5_2wenn,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1blm6a/ipl_summer_promotion_qualifier_discussion/

I'm currently creating a small javascript-based application to help assign the best roles for a LoL team. The idea is that you feed the preferences of each player into the application

The core use cases for this are both for when you're in solo queue and you only have a short period of time to figure out who should be in what role

Currently I'm still making the prototype work exactly how I want, and being written in javascript, it will also not require any time-consuming page loads.

Once you do this

The current set of values I'm using values a player avoiding a role they don't want to play

These scores will be adjusted over time

At the moment, rather than making sure people avoid getting worse roles (5th best).

What I'd like to have is any feedback from people - **does this sound useful**? Is it **something that you would use?** Would it **help to resolve issues in champ select?**

The key idea behind the app is to make it as easy as possible to use

**Screenshots!:**

**Features I'm planning to to add:**

*   Easy to Copy URL reference for other teammates
*   Up to 5 specified roles in order
*   Easier to understand syntax
*   Clearer tie-breaking when multiple matchups are ""best"" in score.
*     More sanity checking (e.g. wanting and not wanting the same role at the same time etc.)",,t5_2wenn,False,,Lulu,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1bq2tg/role_planner_picker_prototype_js_app/

So at the moment the most standard build I see is Doran's Blade on ADC, while taking the opportunities that the support provides.

If support is the laner that is closest to the action

My suggestion:

Support begins with Doran's Shield (with Ninja Tabi as a second item.) This item makes harassing a lot easier, health and a UNIQUE Passive allow the support to initiate fights, without giving up the lane too much should the ADC not follow through (standard for solo queue).

ADC begins with a red pot, and a ward lets support focus on early game harass, while not giving up vision in lane.

One of the issues he points out, not that said subreddit is necessarily a bad thing but it can help giving the wrong impression to people. Everytime a thread about behavior shows up there are tons of comments similar to ""omg this community sucks"" and ""yeah, i have a troll in every match i play"" which clearly shows how the community sees itself, and that's what I think is the biggest problem.

I play on the brazilian server and I'm sure everyone here knows the fame brazilian players have and the worst part is: The brazilian playerbase sees itself as a toxic community. The thing is that it's not nearly as bad as forum posts would make you believe but it ended up turning into some sort of identity issue. Some players think ""Hey, it happens on any server I'm guessing.

I believe it's a perception and, toxic if you will, and then decide to pay it back in the same way before they are even attacked, so anything slightly wrong that someone makes is suddenly seen as trolling, raging and similars. Sure, there are legitimately toxic people in this game, I've played with my fair share of them

I guess the question I ask you goes back to the title: Is the community as bad as people make it seems? Is it only a matter of perception? If it's only perception what can we,,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,True

I posted a while back about launching a month long Pickup game competition. It was supposed to start on March 1st but due to LeagueReplays not getting their stat tracking together I was forced to find new software to accomplish this. Luckily I have found something that does just what we need to make this happen. 

LolMatches is written by one developer who I have been in contact with so if there are more software demands on him I know who to bug :D Over the weekend I recoded almost everything to work with this software and we are almost ready to go. 

But before I officially launch I would like to run the necessary live tests to be comfortable with making an official announcement. 

I will be online all day touching up documentation and running tests. 

If anyone is interested in helping you can add me on league (I Six Pool) or just reply or comment. ",,t5_2wenn,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/19qpql/lolpickupcom_pug_competition_delayed/

Basically I had an idea
I would like to find some amazing LoL players (Plat +) whether they are with a team or not, and I would like to ask them a few simple questions for an interview and it is basically a way of getting your name out there for free. Maybe even finding a couple of team mates or sponsors, who knows?
This series I would like to call: Unknown Legends.

They will be uploaded to my YouTube channel

1363227595.0,1a9ce6,Let's theorize on champ select...here is an idea,irondraconis,7,3,14,"Let's talk about hard barriers

Something that I have yet to see specified (several folks have mentioned it) is the side-system of honor for playing a particular champ/position. Is it helpful for me to see that someone on my team has the green ribbon or red ribbon? sure! But what about having some sort of select-able achievement ribbons (honor

*Champion Specialty-(these numbers could be adjusted for ranked stats or for normals. he ranked stats are already there
Option 1:This summoner has played X number of games as So-and-So. Or Option 2: This summoner has won X number of games as So-and-So
*Position Specialty-
Option 1:This summoner has played X number of games as Support/ADC/AP/BRUSIER/ETC.
Or Option 2: This summoner has won X number of games as Support/ADC/AP/BRUSIER/ETC. These categories should be seperated by the store/ownership pages of champs that says ""pusher/assassin/mage/etc"" that would actually give meaning to those champion specifications. 

Examples: 
Now when you go into champ select and your 1st pick you can see that summoner 5 on your team has 100+wins as a top laner

You just que'd up, you notice that this duo Q has over 50 games played as Support and ADC. They may suck, but they are at the same elo as you, so instead of raging and complaing because you really wanted to play graves/caitlyn/trist, you let them do their thing!

The real backbone of this is that it's customization and changeable for each summoner. Maybe you have more than 2 slots open for achievements-you now have to select

I don't think this creates a HARD barrier to the current situation and thus there are potential problems such as 3 people coming in with 1 or more of the same achievements coming into champ select. But that being said even if you don't get what you want (specifically in ranked) you can still be confident that the player next to you playing your champion or position is competent and is in the same elo using similar champs/positions. 

Possible thoughts? Feedback? Suggestions?",,t5_2wenn,False,,Thresh,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1a9ce6/lets_theorize_on_champ_selecthere_is_an_idea/
1362180737.0,19hr91,Coaches and some ideas on how Lol's matches might benefit if they could do more then worry during a math.  ,Tolio,5,1,8,"So after that sit down with the managers during the LCS a couple weeks ago it made me think on their comment that during the match all the can do is worry.  

That made me think and wonder about things that coaches do during a match in other sports.  And that made me realize most coaches are actively involved during the entire game of pretty much every other sport in existence with the exception being a solo player sport

So why then are coaches forced in a team sport like LoL to take a step back?  Obviously it makes more sense in a solo sport like SC2 where the coach only gets to talk between rounds.  But their team leagues get the coaches very much involved.

So here are things from other sports i see coaches do during a game and how i think they could work for the betterment of lol if Riot would think on them.

1) Most coaches are in charge of subbing under performing players during a match or giving key players a break during low action moments.  I started with this because it's probably the one that has the least impact for LoL. You can't sub mid game it just doesn't work.  However

2) Shot calling

This would probably be the most controverisal of all my ideas as it would fundamentally change how LoL is played

3) Being in on Champion Select picking.  Sometimes i feel a lot of these teams are loosing on champ select.  Their team comp has an over sight of no hard engage against an enemy poke comp etc

4)  Timeouts - One thing most competative esports games lack is the ability for people to take a break players are sometimes forced to sit through a tough neck and neck battle for 40-80 minuets where the fate of one miss play can result in you loosing everything.   Yet if the coaches could put a 2-5 min break once or twice in a match to let the team calm and rethink their strategies it could result in much more interesting matches i feel.  

Obviously something like this would need rules like in sports.  You can't call a timeout mid teamfight for instance.   After a team fight happens you cannot call a timeout until the entire team has respawned giving the winning team time to ride the momentum and make a play etc.   

Another perk/downside of this is timeouts can force a quick commerical break and that's another spot where these struggling tournaments could earn some income rather then the 3-20 min between matches.   

Sorry it's long but i thought that's what this subreddit is for.  I'd love to see if anyone had any other ideas or what people thought of my ideas.  

Sorry for the bad grammar. :(

I am not blind though, but I dismissed that as crazy. I later re-watch [an old episode](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=KbtAn3dic-g) of Extra Credits and the experience of ranked comes to mind while watching. This is when I got the idea to come to Reddit and discuss it with the community.I don't think Riot knew completely what they made, with the new ranking system. 

The way it ranked now is kind of under handed, who keeps playing in their bad moods...and so on. This now conditions a negative connotation of the game, and every time one of these players play they are in a constant bad mood. This cannot stay like it is or it may destroy the games scaffolding, and cause it to tumble into itself. A game without a solid community will fall.

1361992003.0,19cd2d,Another testing of the waters - LCS Liveblogging,Sharokk,5,2,0,"As a followup to my previous post where I got some good feedback about my project ideas, but I still feel like it might be different enough to justify its own existence. Either way,False
1361975127.0,19bsyg,Changed BotRk and S3 changes on forgotten Sivir,Chrammer,2,0,4,"Hi fellow Summoners
at first, i'm neither a high elo player (on my way to plat and higher) nor a LoL-Theorycraft-Monster. I used to be one at my old WoW-time, but i never read and got into the LoL-Calculations. Hopefully someone will be nice and can backup my thoughts with some math.  
And i'm not a master at reddit-formatting

******

Now i jump straight into my thoughts.

We all got the new posts and calculations about the incoming changed BotRk and which ADC would fit with it and why
*I won't discuss the strength and weaknesses of Sivir here

#####I start with the item-changes with the S3 patch:

&gt;Values on Attackspeed and Movementspeed got lowered and the costs increased.  

Isn't that a indirect buff for Sivir in form of her ""Ricochet"" (W) as a auto-attack resetter and her Ultimate ""On the Hunt"" (R)?

My thoughts behind ""Ricochet"":  
With the overall lowered AS-amount of all champs due the item-nerfs and the scalings with extra steroids, but in the early stages of the game, the AA-reset gets used almost always.

Now ""On the Hunt"" (Ultimate):  
We all saw the nerfs to Nunus Bloodboil
*Hope somebody can back me up here

####BotRk-Train####

With a jump on the BotRk-train now
Pro:  
At first, she could just rush away/after an enemy.  
Next up is her ""Ricochet"". With a spike at mid-game when AS-values aren't that high yet and other AS-steroids can't show their potential
Con:  
Her damage as a poke machine gets lowered in mid-game
Her ""Ricochet""-Bounce damage is lower

On top of that: other Champions which want to build BotRk on their own

*****

Sivir got indirectly buffed with the S3-Itemchanges and gets some more potential from Item which came into the game.  
In my opinion, but she should be in a better spot now.

I know, but we all should get great conclusions together.

1374821512.0,1j30wk,Here Is What It Would Take For VUL or TSM To Overcome C9 In LCS,ryry013,3,2,0,"Out of curiosity

* ** 

## How TSM can come in 1st

Lets say

Now C9 has two guaranteed losses in this situation, I'm gonna pretend something happens to C9 and they start losing.  They lose all their games against CLG, CRS, DIG, and VUL, along with TSM having won every game magically.  That leaves two games for C9, one against CST, that will TIE them with TSM

* **

## How VUL can come in 1st

I also have data for VUL replacing TSM in this magical winning spree (this is a completely new scenario, being 17-2 right now, would have to win four games to tie it back up.  Let's assume C9 beat CST and VES, they now have to also win two against CRS, CLG, DIG, DIG, or TSM.

* Aatrox's W: HEAL: 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 (+25% bonus AD)/ENHANCED HEAL: 60 / 75 / 90 / 105 / 120 (+75% bonus AD)

Also

* Xin: TOTAL PHYSICAL DAMAGE: 75 / 175 / 275 (+ 100% bonus AD) (+ 15% of enemies' current health)
* Aathrox: 15% (+ 1% per 100 AP) of their current health. (and no cc)


And he has less HP regen. 

* Xin: 7.0 (+0.7) 
* Aathrox: 5.75 (+0.5)	

I know there is an enhanced heal, in my opinion he is weaker version of Xin.

What is your opinion on Aatrox right know?

If you are interested in him there is few vids from PBE.

Here is a summary of what's done and what's next. Plus presentation of what is supposed to do the tool for you.

Full blog : http://fawardev.wordpress.com

**Completed :**

* Champion Model
* Tested for normality on some values (  Health and Mana)
* UML diagrams are good to go for a while as the next part is going to be Maths

**Next :**

* Extracting data to create the Sourcefile (in process)
* Reader Class to read and use the Sourcefile which contains every champion's availaible informations
* Create the output file
* Automated Normality Test inside the tool
* Internal Database of Champion Models
* Internal Database of modified Champion
* Develop the Rating Model based on the normal distribution (Think  it might be from 0 to 50) (Maths)

**Goal to achieve :**

* Generate the ratings for every stats for each champions
* Create rating for specific Roles/Tactic, *Pushing, Ganking, Sustained Fighting ... (cross ratings)
* Evaluate Match-ups
* Evaluate duo
* Evaluate Team Composition
* Calculate a Win probability for a 5 vs 5 or 3 vs 3
* Take into account runes
* Role Profiles to analyze matchup more accuratly and allies
* Item Rating depending on game time (Early, not role specific
* Champions' Pros and Con (summary)
* No votes or game results used

**What it should do for you :**

* Better bans
* Better picks
* Beta testing builds
* Better Team
* Better understanding of what your champion is able to do.
* Beta testing  new meta
* Help you design custom champions for fun? @LoL's forum
* Know has much as pro learned by themselves

It won't be a simulator

It is developed to help you make better choices. It's still up to Summoners to pull the game out and play it' their very best. Plus

Keep sharing and discussing

1373305794.0,1hvkua,The problem with Thresh is that his souls are too easy to collect.,Nejustinas,4,4,5,"I have an idea about Thresh. 

* Make Thresh's lantern unable to pick up souls. 

* Reduce the drop of souls but maybe increase the armor worth of it by something like 0

This means Thresh has to walk near the souls to pick them up
Why? Even if you zone Thresh

Making the souls worth more but reducing their drop rate with the lantern not being able to pick up souls
Phreak on the champion spotlight said that *Thresh should consider if taking souls is really worth it or not*. *""Oh ok it is not worth it, he will not have a problem about it being on cooldown, because he has plenty of other tricks besides the lantern to make your initiation (if you decide to) be blocked by his CC abilities.

The lantern does not even give that much of a shield, but usually you are ready for it by backing up and placing yourself in a position where the AD carry will be safe when they use the lantern.

So... Yes i agree the lantern is very good for running away

**Meaning

**Also** most Thresh players get boots of mobility
___________________________________

**Conclusion**: Make Thresh lantern unable to pick up souls with the addition of increasing the souls armor
This makes Thresh much more easily harass-able

**TL;DR:** The lantern is literally is just used to collect souls. Remove the ability to collect souls with it and it might fix Thresh into balance
_________

The lantern gets a lot more useful lategame, you probably won't be ready to use the lantern mobility...the only thing you will be using is the shield.

I get what they do. That's not what I mean what I don't get is why they exists.
Because of the fact all champions get boots you have to get them other wise you would never get away form anything.
But what if boots where removed entirely.
I know some items and ability give you movement speed and that's what that champion would have as an advantage over others BUT in place they might be lacking in other areas (Less AP or AD) evening it out making slower champs (with only their base movement speed) to rely on stronger in other areas. I know if boots where removed movement speed on rune pages (much like armor) and Masteries would soon become a norm but then they sacrifice those rune slots away form AD or AP ect. this would make you think more bout what you really want and if you really need that movement speed.
I'm not saying that we should leave all champions with their base movement speed as it is now but why not buff all champions movement speed like they have level 1 or so boots and then remove boots so each champion is already as fast as if they had boots but open up that item slot letting you to build defensive or aggressive with out having to save space for boots. I know you can get boots that fit in to your build with attack speed and MR and armor but items that aren't boots give you better stats on those things.

TL:DR Having an extra item slot over having boots with higher build in base movement speed.

1364867544.0,1bhhoj,A Look into CLG's Champion Select and why Less isn't exactly More,TorCoolguy,2,2,0,"So a lot of people are looking at CLG and thinking ""this protect the Doublelift strategy doesn't really work anymore""

They seem to have this bad problem of losing at champion select. As we all know, allow them to farm up (not that this is a major problem with CLG because we've seen how good Doublelift can be), and just let him carry them to victory. But with the same champions, this strategy is becoming so predictable that I don't think it will work any longer, and here's why.

CLG has played 20 games this season (note that these stats include the 2 games without Chauster where Jiji filled in)

HotShot: Despite being solid in the top lane at times

Chauster: In 12 of his 18 games in the LCS, but has since gone back to old staples. 

Link - Consistently plays new champions, and when he played in Top Lane during MLG Dallas he picked up Rumble and Elise.

Doublelift - He didn't touch Vayne until week 3, one of which is Urgot, who he hasn't touched since week 2.

Aphromoo - Loves his Lulu

So note that while all of this has gone on, but at the same time, tanks are slowly falling out of favor due to items like Blade of the Ruined King, and brusiers who do more damage (Elise, Singed, Jayce, Rumble

Chauster sticks to the staples of the Jungle (Xin Zhao, and has yet to really show an innovative side like NintendudeX or Crumbz. For a player who really tries to show his knowledge, he hasn't done much to really innovate at his position. His low champion pool also doesn't seem to be helping the team.

Doublelift seems to finally be realizing his issues of not being able to carry CLG with Vayne constantly, and one is Urgot. Why hasn't he touched Varus, Tristana, Miss Fortune or Graves? When is Draven going to stop being ""trash"" and he's going to realize that he has to expand his champion pool even more than what he thinks it should be?

Aphro doesn't have much to pick from

Link seems to have the mindset for Season 3, CLG is on fire. If he loses, CLG tends to just fall back to having Doublelift carry. However, this seems to be the way other teams are working and a lot of their innovations are working against CLG.

In Conclusion, they are never going to be the top team again if they don't begin to expand. There are a myriad of champions HotShot could play in the Top Lane to give them a new threat, new junglers Chauster could play, and new AD Carries that would give Doublelift just as strong a chance to carry with less risk. Most people understand that he enjoys the pressure but putting everything on himself will not allow CLG to succeed overall. So less is NOT more in the terms of CLG, because their less is not what will continue to work in the future. This isn't meant to be anything groundbreaking, but a slightly more in-depth analysis on how CLG is picking and winning or losing.",,,Tristana,

1364717853.0,1bcmbm,Why I think Karma was a more interesting champion pre-remake.,charlesviper,19,19,12,"(x-post from [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1bc3wn/karma_q_inconsistency/c95mll4) comment)

Discuss with me how Karma's kit became more interesting post-rework.

**1) Passive / Inner Flame**. Does the new Karma even have a passive? Is it the ""ult CD on ability use"" part of her kit

If it's not, then pop pots at the end of the clear to gank at an overall higher HP. He can also feel more confident in 1v1s as he gets stronger the lower he gets. 

Karma on the other hand has more uses -- save your burst damage until you get hit with abilities

They took a passive that game people a choice and play style, Shen, etc) and completely passive. 

You always want to land abilities

You don't always want to take damage, then heal / shield from the backline? How close to 1 HP can I get?"" (old Karma passive)

**2) R / Mantra**. I'm not going to go QWE first because Mantra is the only important ability on Karma. This is the ability that makes Karma

What are you going to do with those two mantra stacks? You can only use two of your abilities with a Mantra'd bonus. One will have to sit out. 

If you use a RQRE combo (use fans to heal, you lose the ability to mantra the E when it is off cooldown. This sacrifices overall DPS since base Q does damage, whereas base E doesn't. Why not save a Mantra stack for the RERE, while using Q for damage (as AP Karma)? Do you really need to heal at the start of a fight, or do you want max damage?

Furthermore, then 7.9 seconds later hit an empowered Q, with that 'third' Mantra stack building up. A good Karma player could base her engagements around a pre-loaded Mantra stack, sort of like ""overcharging"" her abilities. You could hit a Mantra'd WQ then shortly thereafter hit a Mantra'd E, for 3 bonus abilities at once. This was useful when you were on the team that was engaging, and had high level value: ""Ashe arrow in 4 seconds, I'll have 3 Mantra stacks"" versus

**3) Q / Heavenly Wave**. This is an important note because it was the only % heal in the game. Weak on AD carries early game, and that the base Q was only used for damage. 

**4) E / Soul Shield**. This is her bread and butter. Self shield, empowered shield dealt healthy AoE and was her main damage ability. 

**5) W / Spirit Bond.** 

Ahh

This single ability was the only bad element of her kit. So far it sounds like Karma is an incredibly deep, she had potential. Spirit Bond broke that potential by being wholly underwhelming and incredibly hard to use (as well as, according to Riot, an ability that people couldn't ""read"", they thought Karma's W would damage them as teammates? WTF?). It's almost sad to think how much better Karma could have been, both as a competitive pick, and as a 'fun' hero to play

First things first: it deals damage. Crazy, he wouldn't do anything. If you walked between Varus and Karma, all of the sudden you got hit by a massive nuke. I don't remember the exact numbers but it was like, 300+ base with a ~0.7, *in an AoE*. 

But...that never happened. The range was short

Furthermore, anyone can buy Shureliyas (even Lee, as I laughed at on Scarra's stream recently), Orianna hits a big circle on the floor that is an AoE speed buff / debuff, Jayce has a massive wall teammates can pass through. Karma had this weird position that teammates had to be in to work...it never did. If anyone finds that hilarious video from a year ago of the two guys speeding each other up and 'rubber banding' back and forth to stay in Karma's W, that shit happened *every single game*. 

In other words

Worst of all

------------------------------------------------------

A wise man once said to me, any champion is ""viable"" if you give them big enough numbers of their abilites), *but actually fun to play*. Because Karma was, at her core, a *fun champion*. Running around with 50 HP blocking every source of incoming damage with a well timed shield or heal was *fun*.

**The only change she needed was to her W**. How you would do that

a. First and foremost, ""do I empower Q and W (peeling), E and W (CC and damage an enemy), Q and E (maximum HP gain)"". You have to *chose* how to use your Mantra, and your abilities. But that choice is impactful. If Karma got that one change a year and a half ago, there'd be no 'who is Karma' jokes. Karma would be feared. And Riot surely wouldn't have needed a year long dev time on a total remake that put Karma in no better spot than she used to be. A month from now, why would anyone pick Karma over Orianna?

b. Damage. AP Karma was weak as she only had two abilites that could focus a target. W could not be used offensively if it hit a target. In my opinion, for example, W a cannon creep then walk 'around' the minion path, cutting down the HP of the melee/caster minions. 

c. Frankly, I don't know. But it needed to happen. Would it work like a friendly Morgana ult? Would Karma look like an Octopus with 4 Spirit Bonds floating around her as her team rushed to Baron? How would a Mantra'd W be used in a purely 'friendly' situation (ie, if you didn't want to root an enemy)? I don't have the answers to this question.

----------------------------------------------------------

I haven't played enough Karma to understand the intricacies of her kit, we had a disagreement, clearly there is stuff that's still being worked out about her.

But what does she have that makes her truly unique? What does she have that makes her more situational

I'm genuinely interested to hear. I've explained why I think old Karma was great. It's your turn to explain why new Karma was worth the work.",,t5_2wenn,1364722890.0,,gambit,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1bcmbm/why_i_think_karma_was_a_more_interesting_champion/

1363390021.0,1adp6s,Speed of progression in S3 League System,Grafeno,2,2,14,"When the system was implemented

&gt;""We're still doing the final tweaking of the numbers

[Every division in Season 3 represents 50 Elo](http://competitive.na.leagueoflegends.com/season-two-rating-tiers). It will usually take between 5 and 15 wins, being Google, friends, myself), and then 3 more wins to progress to the next division, making for 8-18 wins in a row. 

I could argue that it takes at least 7-18 games to gain 50 elo (a higher division), making for, 4-5 games (again, assuming no losses).  

Since you might argue that you can't say ""1 division = 50 elo"" anymore, Silver 1150-1499, Gold 1500-1849, Platinum 1850-2199, Diamond 2200+. As you can see in the above link, this was exactly what was used in the transition to the division system; the people in the corresponding Elo ranges got placed in the corresponding leagues/tiers. 

Assuming you just attained Silver in S2, take approximately 32 games (using ~11 Elo per win, which pretty much everyone got after having played enough games). 

In the new system, unlike the ~11 elo per game) 5*8=40 games (winning every game). This is still a significant increase (25%).

This makes me conclude that the speed of progression is not that similar to the previous system. What I want to stress is that I feel I really used a ""best case scenario"" for LP (20 LP per win)

What do you think about the speed of progression in the new Elo system?

Roll on now to eSports. The LCS. Major series of tournaments and gaming. Huge prizes. Teams getting salaries. Players getting athlete visas.

But how is this different to other sports beyond the obvious?

Riot.

No other sport has a...developer. Someone who can control and change something so fundamental about a sport. And I worry.

I worry that Riot's pursuit of something that can appeal to the masses as an eSport. 

The constant balance of the game is admirable. And does help generally. 

But will there come a point where balance has made the game ultimately lack depth? Accessibility traded for depth. It is no longer exciting.

Where balancing turns it into an homogenized mess

1368382861.0,1e70ht,Recent reworks and a variable meta; Have riot gone wrong?,Twibs,1,2,0,"This is just a little post based on my observations on the game. The most recent 5 champions to receive a full rework - Sivir, Sejauni and Trundle - have seen variable levels of play and criticism since their release. However, and Trundle have all benefitted greatly from these reworks due to kits which were just down-right unsuitable for their role
___________

**Sivir**

For those who are unaware, and her W was a toggle which allowed the boomerang to ricochet to 5 enemies and consume mana per attack, akin to Ashe's frost shot in that respect. Sivir was reworked because, in Season 1 and early season 2 she had no niche.

However, the combination of Muramana + Spirit of the Lizard Elder is ideal for her old kit. I would almost assume old Sivir to be a perma-pick/ban in tournament play because of her synergy with Season 3 strategies and items.

______

**Karma**

Karma was a support based around an old Season 1 meta

However come season 3 we see much more variability in tournament play and a slight revival in Melee carries due to greater itemisation, Tristana and Varus in particular). 

New Karma no longer provides the same early game dominance as a support

I have talked to some Old Karma players and they find her new kit ultimately underwhelming; She is a support who is sub-optimal in respect to others such as Janna or Thresh who provide more utility, and her itemised kit falls off very quickly.

______

While Sivir did not have the advantage of foresight to allow her to be exposed to this new environment, Renekton, Cho'Gath and other such melee champions in bot lane perform exceptionally due to the synergy of her kit with champions able to get in close and stick to an enemy.

1367576739.0,1dm186,An alternative All-Star tournament format.,bobvader505,6,8,4,"Hi everyone

The current format received a lot of criticism because the fans got to vote, while e-sports is about the game, if a team wants to survive they have to be able to present themselves as entertainers, hence the success of organizations such as TSM and EG.

Many people proposed that the fan vote only count for a percentage and there should be a coach/player vote that counts for a larger majority.  This better mimics traditional sports but you still run into the issue that the best player might not bring in the best crowd.

Also I would like to mention the stakes of this tournament.  The winning region gets an extra spot in the S3 world playoffs

This brings me to my solution.  Instead of voting for players, with no more than 3 players from any team.

All 15 players then attend the all-star match.  At the start of each game, the coaches choose 5 players from their team to play.  After every game in a match, the coaches must replace at least 2 players, to help ensure that the full arsenal of players are used.

This format introduces a whole new level of mind games and strategy that we currently see in SC2 team leagues

I am not saying that this is the better format

TL:DR - Fans elect 2 coaches who choose 15 players to represent their region.",,t5_2wenn,False,,cloud9,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1dm186/an_alternative_allstar_tournament_format/

1365865120.0,1c9r3x,Passive Gold and Exp Gain for DC,Suq_Madiq_Beech,4,5,9,"We have all experience the DC problem. Top lane DCs and jungle is forced to lane. Enemy jungler proceed to gank lots leading to a 5v4 snowball. Or perhaps a sudden spike forces you to DC and you spend forever downloading the new patch. You come back into the game

&gt;**Current Issue**

I believe the main problem people have with DC’ers is how useless they are. While they are gone, less pushing power, etc. When they come back, they are only a liability. They become easy targets for enemies to kill. Not only are they still worth good money, it is very easy to kill underleveled champions with little to no items. If they stick with the team, they act as an experience sink. If they manage to start farming, it will still take a long time to get back into the action. The 30 cs they manage to get would be better off given to the ADC when the enemy team members are fighting with about 140 cs each. 

&gt;**Proposal**

Give DC player increased passive gold and exp gain. The increase will be like Beginner Bot level. 

&gt;**Explanation**

You may or may not have noticed that Bots don’t operate on the CS-&gt; Gold model. Rather

Disclaimer: This is how I understand how bots work. If I am wrong

&gt;**Why**

With the increased passive gold and exp gain

&gt;**Common Problems**

Abuse is always a major factor to consider. However, you would give up the map pressure of being in the game.  For example, the enemy top laner can push down top tower much faster if you were not there to push back and CS under tower. 

Implementation is the other major consideration. Here it would be pretty easy

Overpowered is a popular argument. I would say the enemy team had time to use their advantage to push lanes, etc so giving the DC player some gold and exp wouldn’t be too much.

&gt;**Further Comments**

This is not meant to be a final solution to the DC issue. This is just something small than can help the quality of gameplay

Like I mentioned at the beginning, there are too many ways for abuse and other problems. Besides, what if the DC comes back? Does the filler person simply just get kicked off? How would a retransition work? Not letting the DC come back has moral issues. What if it was an accidental power cord pulling? It isn’t right to deny somebody their own game.

&gt;**TL;DR**

* Increased passive gold and exp gain for DC player once they hit summoning platform

* Much less than normal gain from farming to prevent abuse

* Just meant as small help so when people reconnect

There is currently a thread on the front page discussing the potential issues that might arise with the language barriers within the EU All Stars line up.

It would be interesting

For example, after watching EDward's stream a little bit, it's clear he can speak English at a competent level. Would it perhap function well with him translating Snoopeh's (or whoever makes the calls on EG) to Genja and instructing him to play according to those calls?

It seems so easy to suggest that we choose players concerning which language they speak. Perhaps some thought can be given for working around this.

Note

Also, nash etc). I don't think this is a solution to the problem, however.

Pro's even use the term ""try harding"" in a negative sense. Like it's a bad thing to do your best. This is generally in regards to solo queue

But what happens when it comes to LCS? These best of one's are no joke. Anyone can take a game from anyone. 

You have to care.

EG have had been on a bit of a tilt recently

GG/former M5 seem to have some unusual team dynamics, and work well together. 

On the other hand

One team was recently seen to be viciously arguing with eachother (the captain and the carry). While some of it might have been exaggerated

Another team famously had a huge bust up which was recorded by a webcam of their gaming house with team mates really abusing eachother. This was quite a while ago.

But I think the people with the most potential are the ones who act professionally.

I'm the head of a small organization, I tell them that what I think, why I think it, and then with all of that in mind, why I think their decision was the wrong one.

1362651425.0,19u78f,Eleisa's Miracle - The forgotten support Item,Hauerli,11,12,18,"Hi 

So today i would like to talk with you about Eleisa's Miracle.
I recently saw that the Eleisa's Miracle got buffed in the v3.02 patch (i think about 3 Weeks old).

    Undocumented change : 
    Cooldown reduction of Heal



**The Item is build out of Philosopher's Stone.**

We all know that this is an essential item for all supports.

**it gives 10 HP/5 and 15 mp/5** 

These are +3 hp/5 and +6 mp/5 from Philosopher's Stone 


**Unique Passive – Aid: Your Summoner Heal

Clarity and Clairvoyance are in my optinion not relevant but the Heal reduction is interesting ! 


**Unique Passive – Eleisa's Blessing: If you gain 3 levels with this item

This passiv is nice cause u get a free slot for mid/late game the point is u need to buy it at lvl 15 to get this passiv but to be honest if u get it that late u wont get the cd reduction and i peronally think thats the point why u should get this item. 


**Total Costs are 1100g upgrade from Philo is 400g**

i think the 400g upgrade for this passiv + regenerations are really nice its even 75g less than u need for a Ruby Crystal


**Eleisa's Miracle is gold efficient even without its passive.**


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Idea:**

If i play Leona i tend to get my Philosopher's Stone as 1st or 2nd Item. 
so if i get it as second item the game is about 10 minutes old and i am at lvl 7.


if i get the upgrade to Eleisa's Miracle next i get it at min 12 and i am lvl 8-9 at that moment.


I am still in laning phase cause of this the hp and mp regeneration is really good to raise the pressure at the enemy with constant pokes. 



**Now to the crucial point:**
I play Leona all time with exhaust + heal. 
The 30% cd reduction would bring my Heal CD down from 300s to 210s.
Furthermore the passive stacks multiplicative with Mastermind.
So i can get a total CD reduction of 37% which would result in a cd of 189s (3min9s). 


In my theory i am lvl 12 got my Sighstone and my Eleisa's Miracle these items give me vision and sustain.
Furthermore cause of the passive of Eleisa's Miracle i get a 3min aoe-heal that gives me and my teammates 355 HP (+20 per lvl) for example soraka heal gives all 320hp for a 180s cd.



**Conclusion:**
I think this item is really nice if u combine it with heal especially at times where Locket of the Iron Solari is a must have item on Junglers u negate  at lvl 12 170(+10 per lvl) + 320(+ 20 per lvl) = 490 dmg  points on all teammates u hit.
Cause of the low cooldowns it is nearly on most of all team fights present. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**tldr**

This item is cost efficient without its passive.

it gives me 2 min cd on my Summoner heal.

In combination with a Locket of Iron Solari (Jungler) u can negate 490 dmg at lvl 12 on all Teammates u hit.

It releases the item slot after 3 lvl.

1363797949.0,1ao6u1,Stalling In A 4 Minute Tower Laneswap Meta: An Analysis of Scenarios - By iPandaN,iPandaN,1,3,10,"**Introduction:**

Hey guys, and here's my next one :)

If you were interested in my previous posts they were:

[Tanking Without a Tank](http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/19usob/a_theory_craft_of_an_interesting_sort_tanking/)

and

[Barely Protect the Twitch](http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/19pwg5/barely_protect_the_twitch_a_theorycraft_in_the/)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**The Strategy:**

Let's assume we're purple side and we lane swap so our adc and support 2v1 top and our ""top"" (Which will be Galio for this example) 1v2 in bottom. So what's been happening is the junglers will do their routes and then 3v1 in top and bot which means they can take the towers uncontested really early, red, wraiths. He can go bot when the enemy jungle is bottom. This means we have a 2v3 in bottom, and still a 2v1 in top lane.

Blue team is cutting EXP 3 ways in bottom lane as long as they are trying to siege 3v2. But Purple team is taking Olaf/Vi/Maokai in the jungle with a Galio solo bottom (who can TP and get Chalice, but meanwhile the 2v1 top lane is pushing up.

**With this scenario kind of layed out 4 things can happen:**

- **#1** Blue side takes bottom

This could still happen

- **#2** Purple takes top and holds bottom

This is the best case for Purple. Puts them at a great advantage. 

*In my head the team comp here is Twitch Zyra Galio Kha'Zix and Vi. This means Kha'Zix Can ward enemy blue --&gt; head top, which the jungler theoretically Holds until they arrive.*

- **#3** They both Hold

This is again better for purple, purple side has gotten more EXP in total than Blue side, assuming neither mid lane has not gone B.)

*Also in my head this is better for purple
Farming Up and Stalling (I prefer Prolonging as you're still being aggressive using your lead to take objectives and further it) is always going to benefit the team with the Hypercarry more than the team without it (mind you both teams could have hypercarries

- **#4** Blue take bottom tower and holds top tower

I think this is rather unlikely, Kha'Zix has the option to safely ward enemy blue on his way to towerdive 3v1 or take tower and force their top away from it. Meanwhile Galio is coming mid to hold. and Jungler goes back to farm jungle.

This most likely means that blue side is now going to dragon

This is probably the worst outcome for purple


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Conclusion:**

3 Out of the 4 Possible outcomes of this scenario will benefit purple side more than they will blue side. Seems legit, as I will respond to most, if not all of them! :)

The reasons why I think why it is less entertaining:

Most of the games aren't even close - This is also a big problem I have with other sports (football, I'm watching to see both teams use absolutely everything they have to win. I want to see competition, not a top 3 team roll over GGU or Vulcun.

I want to see the best - I think a large reason sports and e-sports are entertaining is because people like to watch the people who are the best at what they do. Frankly, but after seeing both of them lose to international teams just reminded me that this stale stereotype is still true. I understand that they were just two bo3s but they were both 2-0s and the Crs v KT games weren't very close. This is also evident seeing other regions innovating and changing the meta, while NA just copies it. There isn't anything really original coming from NA.

It needs to change.,HotSauceJohnson,22,24,99,"It's an extremely ham-fisted way of compelling players to spend money on indirect power. It's not so much about the stats that you get from runes as it is about the delivery mechanism.

It also punishes players who want to try new things, you're screwed.  There isn't any other choice you have.  You might even own the runes that would help you out against that opponent, but you can't use them because you didn't want to spend $20 **to use the runes you already own.**

It's not fun

Personally, but that being forced to spend either time or money to use them is extremely unfair to everyone.  Considering how the pages are priced it's ridiculous to expect people to invest that much time or money into something that isn't in any way fun.  

It's far more satisfying as a player to acquire new characters or runes that buff my existing characters because there is a tangible affect.  That isn't the case with the pages

1361897509.0,199lvw,Season 3 is Basically Killing the Game [Item Diversity: FoN/Bulwark/S2/S3 and more],Oceee,24,26,31,"Hello Summoners

I've been meaning to make one of these posts for quite some time now




But before we start I want to make a few things clear :

*1. I am not a native english speaker so do not expect me to have perfect grammar.

*2. I am not a professional player. I am just a random high elo nobody. I didn't write this to quote someone else

*3. This is my first ever post (blog?) of this kind and I am pretty bad at formatting with reddit.






Lets begin then. Season 3 patch was huge and mind-blowing. Riot changed so much in one patch

*Top = Carry

*APC = Carry

*ADC = Carry

*Jungler = Gold Support

*Support = Goldless Support

This might not make sense to you now but I will get to it later.





**The AD Carry**


During Season 2 AD carries were on top of the food chain. They reigned supreme over everyone and decided the outcomes of most games. They were literally Gods.

The reason for this was their item build. There was only 1. The the Pentagon Of Power, the sooner they would beat the crap out of everyone else. There was nothing really interesting or fun about ADs. It was the same thing over and over again on each one. It didn't matter who you would play, since you would do the exact same thing. So what made them fun? Well the Pentagon Of Power sure did. How could it not be? You were able to kill anything and everything that stood infront of you. Why should you try to kite the enemy renekton when you can survive his burst and then sustain the rest of his dmg with your lifesteal. 


But the Season 3 patch came and changed everything. Most importantly it hit the Pentagon Of Power ( PoP?) and it hit it hard. Every single item in it was nerfed. So that solved one of the problems with ADs. They were no longer the Gods they were in S2, Statik Shiv, Black Cleaver (face it old one was never worth anything), Hurricane, Zephyr and so on. While some of the weren't really successful (e.g. Hurricane) others became viable items with clear advantages and disadvantages (e.g. Statik Shiv). With this many new items in the game ADs now have a contender on their pentagon for every item except IE, and their second problem is also somewhat solved.




**AP Carries**


APs also received a bag of changes

But with the latest patches it looks like Riot are trying to revert this. They buffed Athene's

Well not everything is bad in the new patch. The introduction of Seeker's Armguard was a really good move. Everyone has acknowledged the fact that we needed an ap/armor item that could be easily obtainable

So why would you buff the already best items? It's bad enough that we have to buy Voidstaff every single game




**Bruisers - Top Lane Carry


The reason why I am putting these 3 together is because there is not much to say about the supports. Generally the bottom lane support (or Goldless Support) builds cheap and cost effective items(e.g. Locket, Frozen Heart). Both of them aim to aid their carries with whatever they can - CC, shields, heals etc.

So yeah there isn't much to say about supports so lets move on to the Top Carry. This is where it becomes tricky. The majority of champions played top lane are bruisers who can play both as dmg dealers and tanks. Thus they have a huge item pool to choose from... or so we think atleast.




**Force of Nature**


When Season 3 came an item called Force of Nature (a.k.a. FoN) was removed from the game. There were numerous of reasons for this

*+40 health regeneration per 5
*+76 magic resistance
*+8% movement speed

UNIQUE PASSIVE: You gain health regeneration equal to 1.75% of your maximum health. 


For those of you who don't know how and why it was broken on some top laners I will explain.

1. If you add up the flat and % health regen you average top laner would end up with 70-100 hp/5. How are you supposed to win a lane against someone who regens anywhere from 840 to 1200 hp per minute? It was just not possible. Buying FoN in lane basically made you AP Tryndamere.

2. It gave MS. This is probably the most underrated stat for top lane

3. Magic Resist and Movement Speed crushed the jungler and the mid laner. Since ad mids were unheard of and outside of lee and noc every jungler was mostly magic dmg


But here is the catch. The champions who could abuse FoN had high base dmg and didn't really need to build more. You couldn't buy FoN on Riven or Irelia and except to be as useful as Olaf with a FoN. Your champion just did not have the kit for it. So you lost the game before it had even started. Seems fair?




**Bulwark**


Imagine this scenario: You are playing top lane and your jungler has a Bulwark

So what do you do ? Ughm.... you buy.... a spi.... ANOTHER BULWARK. Why? Why not? You are the Top Laner. You don't care about cost efficiency since you have hundreds of minions killed. You only care about slot efficiency and if you were to compare it to every other end-tier MR item




**AURA ITEMS SHOULD NOT BE SLOT EFFECTIVE FOR THE BUYER**


The whole reason to have aura items is to have something that helps th team. You give up on stats so everyone on your team can have them. You give up on 30 MR so everyone else on the team can have it. See where I am going? Aura items should never be cost/slot effective for the bearer. You buy aura items so that the overral strenght of the team grows more

The worst part is that those auras have different buffs for the one who is carrying it. This way you get to have the same aura TWICE.

Bottom line is while Bulwark can't be abused the same way you could abuse FoN




Well this is most of what I have to say about the game right now. You can decide for yourself what my word is worth.

OP's list to promote discussion/ideas:  

Corki - Impossible to balance across all stages of the game with a % true damage passive. Suffers from high mana costs in order to keep his siege damage in check

Dr Mundo - A relatively boring concept with a poor tie in to his back story. Volibear and Singed are much more engaging regen tanks.  

Fiora - Any itemisation she'd benefit from would be better used by champions like Xin Zhao. Permanently unviable

Gangplank - Suffers from the same overloaded kit problems as Irelia

Heimerdinger - Role has been taken over by Zyra

Irelia  - Well documented.

Karthus - Presents little counterplay in lane

Kha'Zix - Leaves no reason to play any other AD assassin. Rework would not do his theme justice.  

Master Yi - See Fiora.  

Miss Fortune - Little counterplay

Quinn - Useless ultimate

Rengar - Kit overload. Offensive steroids, invisibility, movement speed buff, CC.   

Sona - Almost no downside to picking her.

Soraka - Removes the incentive for active play in bot lane. Will miss the archetpye

Thresh - Either new champions get lots of displacement abilities like the lantern

Tryndamere - See Fiora. Also no fun for low skill players to play against.  

Urgot - Not fun to support for or lane against. Lots of hidden power (ie the damage reduction) but only one big flashy ability

Zac - What a stupid champion. Free guardian angel, a ludicrously large gap closer. Should never have made it out the door. Balance will always rest on a knife edge.

----

Honourable Mentions

Ezreal - Needs the blink taken away or given a more appropriate cooldown. Compare to abilities like Satchel Charge.  

Graves - Smokescreen has to go.  

Katarina - Needs mana. [Not 100% sure on this one

Poppy - Comprehensive rework necessary. Could stay true enough to character to remain in the game afterwards.  

Shen - Bored of seeing this guy competitively. Leads to incredibly passive drawn out games.  

Sion - Comprehensive rework necessary.  

Teemo - Verges on unbeatable in lane, no idea how.  

Twisted Fate - Seems unable to be balanced for both low levels of play and OGN. Perhaps needs to be converted to AD.  

Vi - Defensive steroid, auto-attack reset, un cc-able gap closing CC. Really obnoxious but balanceable.  

Yorick - Not sure on this one. Seems very tricky to balance
