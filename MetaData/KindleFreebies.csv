It's got 5 star/29 ratings on Amazon and 4 stars/40 ratings on Goodreads.

I wrote the book as a result of Reddit's encouragement.

Some of my posts that led to the writing of the book:

Both books have hit the boards in the UK (thank you, UK redditors) and Paradox has found a place in Germany (thank you, German redditor!). So far no action in the other parts of the world.

Uh oh. I've been found out. I'll be back.

**Edit 2** The turkey's been eaten (well, fly). The race is *on!*

Aunty Ida has a commanding lead, and #36 in humor (!) while Paradox trails at #1,619 overall and #45 in humor. In the UK, Aunty Ida leads as well. Germany, holds steady, while newcomer Italy joins the race.

Aunty Ida is smug. She gets inventy when she's smug

**Edit 3** Well,263 overall, and #41 in humor, while Paradox is at #1,671 overall and #48 in humor. Aunty Ida pulled out her soldering iron. Please hold on to your metals, precious or otherwise.

**Edit 4** Aunty Ida's not even checking over her shoulder, while Paradox has fallen back to #1,768 overall and #49 in humor. Could it be that time is not on Paradox's side?!

**Edit 5** Well, even this early, for Aunty Ida. I don't think that Paradox can bridge the gap. Maybe it'll get her next time? Aunty Ida would like you to remember to mind your thoughts!

It's been a month since I released this particular apocalyptic short-story-turned-serial-turned-novel on Amazon; to celebrate, starting at around midnight tonight (from what I understand) and ending on 12:00 AM Tuesday. Here's a little excerpt, Scene 20 ...

**20.**

In a tiny border town named Tranquilidad, and the refugees fled to the basement. The basement door was even heavier, reinforced with ornate bands of steel and securely fastened with a deadbolt, but the infected were not easily discouraged and had been battering away at it ceaselessly for almost forty-five minutes. The terrified townsfolk could hear their friends and relatives going berserk above them, kicking down the pews, ripping down the hanging chandeliers, and randomly attacking one another.

Among their number was Father Alvera, a couple of ranchers, the town's sheriff, and a dark-haired girl of about ten who none of the group knew. She was catatonic from shock, and had both a black eye and a bad bite wound on her upper right arm. The flesh was torn and hanging raggedly, the tear seeping blood and yellowish curds of fatty tissue. Father Alvera had cleaned and wrapped it up as well as he could with the church's dusty First Aid kit. Everyone else in the beseiged group had managed to avoid sustaining any major injury thus far.

Very little was being said. Everyone was either pacing restlessly or sitting on the floor against the wall, something hard and resolved. Father Alvera noticed this, and it troubled the priest. He stayed beside the girl, sitting on the floor with her and holding her limp hand. The girl's light brown eyes were glassy and unfocused. Occasionally, as a reflex against the sting of dust, her eyelids would slowly close, then ponderously open again. The priest wondered if she could see or feel anything, in her mind's eye?

""They don't give up, after all. That door can't hold up-"" 

""Stand up and step away from her, suddenly. He pushed himself up the grey concrete wall with his feet and stepped forward, the hard heels of his snakeskin boots creating flat, clomping echoes against the floor. His face was bleak under the round brim of his dusty hat. 

Heart pounding, said, ""This isn't the movies, Lance. Okay? This is real life. They aren't *zombies,* up there. They're living, breathing *people,* not the undead. This affliction is natural in its cause, and when the *proper* authorities are able to get here - not *you*, angrily

""Yeah,"" one of the ranchers chimed in, ""you know, with the virus that's like rabies, or something. Could be like that. She could have it, turn any minute and start in on us."" Even in the weak light emitted by the bare forty-watt bulbs that hung from ceiling, the rancher's hired help blanched at this idea visibly.

""Screw that! Someone shoot her!"" the teenage kid burst out

""Oh, that's bullsh-""

""Is it, with a face like cracked leather. His gaze was flat and cold. ""What made all them folks upstairs there decide to start beatin' and eatin' on us, then? Didn't like their ole lady's eggs 'n grits this morning?"" The cowboy's hand drifted to the .45 holstered inside his denimn jacket. ""Step away now, Padre. We got to do this, before she turns on us.""

The man's wife barked a sarcastic laugh, now, huh? It all happened so fast. No one was sick beforehand.  That's not how a virus works. There's always a period of time when you start coming down with symptoms. You tell us how that's even possible, huh?"" the wife demanded of the men. Her eyes were wide and wet.

""I'll tell you what, the way I see it,"" the sheriff expounded, pulling his sidearm out of its black leather holster, ""or maybe the fucking terrorists did it. The guys that are always hollering and firing their rifles into the air on TV whenever they blow something to Hell and back. Does it *matter* how it started, or *why?* It's *happening,* and I don't want to die, either. Now, and we've got a spiraling problem on our hands

He straightened and steadied arm

""*Wow, I'm not usually the one to say shit like this, but chill the fuck *out*, man,"" said the Native ranch hand, looking dismayed by this turn of events. He circled away from the drawn guns. 

The other rancher, shouted, ""Hey! You guys gone *loco,* man? Put your guns away, eh? What you doin' that for, I thought the crazy people were upstairs!""

""Shut up, who was now completely covering the girl with his robes, and looking back at the firing squad from over his shoulder. With a tone of finality, the sheriff told Alvera, ""Do as I say right *now,* boy.""

Sweating, I would *never* do that, and your soul will burn in *Hell* if any of you pull that trigger, do you understand? You will suffer torment and agony greater than anything those crazy people upstairs could possibly inflict on you, because it will be *forever.* Do you understand? Stop this, don't do-""

""I don't believe in any of that crap

""Don't try and go all *what-would-Jesus-do* on *me, dammit - are you listening? This here is your absolute *last* chance, man, I'm not shittin' you. Get out of the goddamned *way*."" The lawman's lip curled with impatient disdain. His round, florid face was set and determined. The girl was already dead, in his eyes. The priest could join her or not, but the girl was already dead.  

""As for me, I dunno about there being a God or no God, or maybe a *different* God ... but I'll take my chances,"" the cowboy drawled. His face tightened. His eyes narrowed. Talking was done. The shooting was about to start.

*BLAM! BLAMBLAM!* Three concussive explosions snapped out, and everyone's ears were ringing. All heads turned to Lopez, who had a .357 Colt at his right hip, his opposite hand resting on the hammer.  

Lopez holstered his weapon. His face was struggling with a mixture of anger and sorrow.

""I had to, uh, I think He's gonna understand.""

Book Summary:

Quinn Robbins never planned on sacrificing anything. Her life was perfect - everything she thought a teenager's should be. But all of that is about to change. What starts out as curiosity over the strange behavior of the reclusive William Rose quickly leads her to an adventure she never could have imagined - to the discovery of an alternate universe where time works differently than it does in Quinn's world - a world where even simple electricity is advanced technology, a new Young Adult series that has been described by readers as ""The Chronicles of Narnia meets Cinderella.""

PREEMPTIVE TL;DR: Links to download my free novella in [kindle](http://db.tt/Qi2wZpOn) and [epub](http://db.tt/yNISuXty) formats.

I'm Christopher Ruz, with a bit of erotica stirred in. I've gotten great reader reactions so far on both Amazon and Goodreads, but I'm atrocious at publicity. So, with the release of the fifth Olesia Anderson story just last week, I thought it might be time to give away book 1 to interested readers.

&gt; Dirty Deals follows Olesia Anderson - sharpshooter, the Blackrock Association. A Lockheed engineer has stolen the schematics for a new missile defence system, and Lockheed wants that data back... along with whoever he was planning to sell to.

&gt; It's supposed to be an easy job - get in, Olesia will have a hard time keeping her head on her shoulders...

Dirty Deals is 24, action-packed read. The book is available free in [kindle](http://db.tt/Qi2wZpOn) and [epub](http://db.tt/yNISuXty) formats as a direct download (giving anything away through Amazon is one hell of a hassle, and a time limited giveaway doesn't seem fair to me).

[And check out a recent review by a fellow redditor!](http://aliceleiper.com/2013/02/17/review-exiles-of-arcadialegionnaire-by-james-gawley/)

Synopsis and Info:

'Exiles of Arcadia' blends history and fantasy to create a world that is as real as the past and as personal as childhood.

Primus Seneca has lived most of his life in exile. Ten years ago his father led an army against the ruthless dictator Tiberius–and was crushed. Now the general plans his revenge from the snowy heart of the Boreal forest, his father, and the very nature of the gods.

'Legionnaire' is the literary debut of author James Gawley

""Pray all you like. You cannot command the gods.""
