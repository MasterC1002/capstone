Fast forward to 5 years past his death. I happen to move into his home. I'm ecstatic yet sad. Good memories clouded by the sadness of missing my uncle. Everything seemed normal. I wasnt a believer of ghosts or spirits so I never expected anything to happen. Second night after I moved in his bedroom door opened. I immediately thought it wasn't latched properly. Next day the tv swiveled on its own. I thought that was a bit weird. 

My uncle was always a jokester. Loved bugging people. I noticed that items would be out of place a lot. Or I'd lose something then after frantically looking it would be in its original spot after some time had passed. 

My daughter will often stare into a random area and start to smile and babble happily (she's 10 months). When she was a new born I could SWEAR I heard a male voice coming from her room as she would suddenly stop crying but

What has inspired me to share my experiences tonight is that I now know for sure it is my uncle haunting my house.

Allow me to layout the room for you with this crude drawing.
http://imgur.com/n38B7 
red = beds

We moved into the room

Our alarms went off and we all got up got dressed and went to work. Me and Tucker went to the chow hall that afternoon and while sitting there talking he looked at me and asked why I was going through Millburns ""secretary"" last night. I laughed and told him it wasn't me ... then reality set in, if someone else got in that room they would have to crawl across Tucker or unlock the heavy metal door without us noticing. We both shrugged it off as something odd and creepy... and of course that alone would be a decent story.

Over the next few weeks we had the wall lockers (3 doors) all be locked @ night and open in the morning

I had been having nightmares where I would wake up, couldn't sit up, couldn't speak, nothing. Then I would close my eyes, take a deep breath like I was trying to reset my limbs (same as restarting a computer I suppose) and when I opened my eyes there would be a shadow pinning me down. I would freak out and try to struggle and eventually sit up after the shadow faded away. 

I had had this dream with increasing frequency

1 Year later. Tucker and I were roommates again, neither of us were big drinkers.

Our conversation was going in the direction of who else we may get as a roommate, I said to him ""I Used to have these freaky dreams in that room, and I haven't had a single one since."" His reply sent cold chills down my back. It was something along the lines of ""You wake up, try to get up, and can't move, that's when you notice the witch pinning you down, you struggle a few minutes and are finally free. I had the same dreams, was better to pretend they didn't exist."" A long moment of silence ensued. All I could say was ""I suppose you're right

Tucker wasn't some strange stringy kid, things he knew about ""the paranormal,"" passed down through his family. I was 6' 190 lbs. muscle at the time, both raised in a christian household. I even then spent most of my time reading articles, on anything that would make me more knowledgeable, everything psychology, quantum physics, computer sciences. I have found something that would explain the paralysis its apparently something males experience

It was a nice house and had a huge attic playroom with a bedroom in it (it was huge to 4 yr old me). My uncle who was 15 at the time lived in the attic bedroom

I never felt very comfortable in that house

I always slept with my door open at that age for some reason. I would hear all sorts of sounds in the kitchen at night, etc, but I was convinced that it was someone just up getting a snack, or doing dishes and I just couldn't see the kitchen light based on the angles of the walls, or something equally stupid.  That all changed one night.

I woke up about 1AM one night to the sounds of footsteps coming down the attic stairs, and then it said my name. I can still hear the gravelly whisper ""Hey robbie...we can see you.  hey, robbie, come upstairs and play...""  That was it for me.  I screamed like you see in the movies. My parents came in the room like they were on fire. I told them what happened and they just got mad at me, told me to go back to sleep and that it was just a dream.

They shut off the lights and went back to bed, I was done.  I screamed as loud as I could and ended up sleeping in my parents room that night.

The next night something really weird happened.  I went to bed as normal, shadowy...thing.  Not a normal shadow, just really dark, darker than it should have been. It was just sitting there. It made me feel calm and safe. I would have conversations with it, though I never recall it responding.  After that night, I slowly became more confident and secure at night. Most nights the dark mass was there in the corner, I guess protecting me from whatever the hell it was that wanted ""to play with me"".  

I remember every detail so vividly...just writing this sent chills up my spine. It's for this reason that I believe in ghosts. ",self,t5_2r1q4,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/xlbt7/i_was_4it_knew_my_name/

I have trouble sleeping and always have mostly due to restless legs as well as suffering from anxiety. Most nights I would get up and walk around the house, do some leg exercises, and stuff like that to help me sleep better.

On one particular night I had more trouble sleeping than usual. Legs weren't much of the issue this time but my anxiety was flaring up, work, etc. As well as the anxiety, I also had this strange feeling of being alone but being watched even though my brother shared a room with me and he was fast asleep, and a little too quiet. He is always shifting or mumbling something. I shake it off to be just a weird random feeling.

I start to walk out into the hallway towards the bathroom and I notice it's very quiet. Like the ringing in your ears kind of quiet but even without the ringing. Now we lived out in the country with very thin walls, it was very still.

I head to the bathroom, so I turn around, no one is there. I turn back and from the corner of my eye see a small figure dash from the living room towards the kitchen. It was a full moon that night so the room was well lit. No guessing on shadows here.

Starting on my way through the living room after gathering myself from fear and rising anxiety, I'm the only one to have ever heard the running. So I decided to tuck my tail and jump back into bed under the covers hoping I was dreaming or imagining things. But then I started to get really thirsty and needed that glass of water.

I head back to the kitchen and notice something unusual again

I finish my glass of water and head through the dining room but before I get to the living room

I hear whispers from the laundry room then the clock stopped ticking. Dead silence. Only the sound of my breathing. I spent what felt like an hour slowly moving to the front room

I spend a few moments deciding if I should wake my parents or not and decide to try, I thought maybe it got to them before I did. I head for the front door. Step out to the porch and even outside everything is perfectly still and soundless. It was freezing and no friends lived close enough. I spent maybe ten minutes outside before the cold wasn't bearable anymore and I had to face what might be living in the house.

I freak out and remember my brothers(the youngest had his own room, a small shadowed figure, but seemingly solid. It dashes around the side of the fireplace and vanishes. A short and distant sound but very close atmospheric laughter like a child's.

That's it. My body can't take anymore

I woke up about an hour or two later

Thoroughly the years of living there small variations of this event happened and I still put it off as ghosts. I always had such horrible anxiety living there but it has gotten much better since I moved out. But every time I step foot in that house I feel my anxiety flare up again and the weird feeling of being watched.

""This is cool, i can do without a dog.  I still have this huge awesome house to play in.

So, drop the box and just yell ""MOM....DAD...YOU NEED TO COME HERE....NOW!""  This room is maybe 10x10 feet, nothing in it except for every single inch of wall and CEILING was covered in satanic drawings, pictograms and depictions.  Within 15 minutes that room was painted over, the light bulb taken, the door shut and locked from the outside never to be open again.  That was the start of it.

So, my sister was almost too young to remember anything except one big incident and my dad is like ""FUCK THAT SHIT.""

So a little history, before prepping the I-500.  Numerous times me and my sister would be sitting watching prime time TV and we'd hear the screen outside door open and the oak door deadbolt unlock, the doors open, then both the doors slam shut.  We would both go running to the back door thinking dad was home early to get something.  We'd round the corner and there would be no one there.  Multiple times this would happen.

When we moved in and i got to throw stuff in my room I remember finding a small front-loader childs toy in my closet.  My parents and I thought this was weird since they don't remember that being there when there were shown the house (being completely empty and already moved out of) and there was also a strange symbol drawn on the wall of my closet.  Needless to say I NEVER slept with that closet door open.

Often i would be playing with legos or video game in my room and if you've ever grown up with legos you get to know and recognize the sound they make when you throw a single lego on to a pile of others.  It makes a very distinctive platic hollow 'plink', always just out of site.  Eventually I just ignored the sounds.

It was my sister's 6th or 7th b-day (sorry no cake day picks to submit for karma) and i had helped her clean her room earlier that day since i'm a awesome older bro (and my mom told me to :P).  So most of the way through her party my mom yells for her and me upstairs, clothes out of draws.  My mom thought she had done this and we both told her no we had cleaned the room and been downstairs the whole time for her party.  We still had to clean it all up.

More stories later as i have to go to work...


EDIT:

Lets see, closings, sisters room gettin thrashed after we cleaned it up, legos getting thrown in my room and a room of Satanic Evil in the basement.
So upon asking my dad

OK, there was a pipe that ran the entire length of the room so she hung her clothes on it as well we some cabinets and drawers built into one side it. There was also a door that led to the outside to a tiny ass balcony, like big enough for the door top open on to and that's it. I HATED this room and I didn't know why. As soon as we moved in this room just gave me the creeps. So, if you were standing in this room and looking out into my sisters room you can see the door that leads to the hallway fully. One day, i'm the only one home during the summer and i'm finishing my chores. Laundry is last and I always put my moms stuff away last since i hated being in the room. So I walk in, put clothes in the drawers, hang up her couple blouses and turn to leave and BAM I freeze.

Sitting on the other side of the door frame(leading into the attic room) is this basketball sized, drank a beer, done ANYTHING that could possibly change my body chemistry. This was real, it was staring me in the face, and I could feel the fear in the air. Being 13 years old though all I could do was stand there utterly frozen.

Then it moved.

It shot across the door frame(from right to left) and dissapeared on the other side. As soon as it was out of site my brain turned back on and had one thought going through it. RUN...run now...run now fast...fast fast fast. My body soon listened. All this time i kept my eyes glued open on both the doors and I didn't want this thing to be running out in the hall and then me lose where it went. As far as i could tell it was waiting just on the left side of the door outta site. I lept over the door's threshold both hands in the tightest little fists i could make ready to fight for my life. As I scanned the length of the wall between the two doors there was nothing...just nothing. I spent the rest of the day over at my friends.

It was with that incident that it clicked. Why the previous owners had 2 small dogs(found this out after we moved) but we couldn't have any. The room down in the basement
I may not be religious

EDIT2:  here's google's street view.  It's a house that's red on the top half

I watched as he left in the ambulance back to the hospital 4 hours away. I was sad but had a great day. My dad had told me to get ready for bed around 9 and I hopped right into bed exhausted. I fell asleep almost immediately.

1371434551.0,1ghkwc,My family's camping trip,J4rrod_,36,8,22,"This happened about 7-8 years ago. I was about 15.

I used to live in very rural West Virginia. I mean very, you get the picture. Anyway, my family and I decide we wanted to take a camping trip up in this hollow (""holler"" as we call it) we took our 4wheelers (see: ATV) to often. We end up rounding up 8-9 family members and 10-11 friends, so around 20 people in all. 

On the evening of our camping trip, scaring, etc. his nieces and nephews. On the ride over there, he tells me this story about where we're going. He says that there's a field about 6 miles from our camping spot that had an elementary school on it in the 1800's, and that one day it burned completely to the ground (I actually did know that part was true). He goes on to say that while everyone knows about that, not everyone knows that none of the kids in the school made it out of the fire alive. Then he says ""on full moon nights, at 3am, I tell him he's stupid and I never give it a second thought. 

We get to our camping spot, just because it's a nice ride out there, and it's by a river; very peaceful. We spend some time there and then head back to camp. At this point it's probably 10pm. We get back, roast and eat some hot dogs and marshmallows, talk, laugh, etc. I end up telling everyone else there what my uncle had said and they all laughed it off too. Then, my uncle suggests us going on another ride. Half of our party went,"" figuring I was calling his bluff. But no. He goes off the trail, unmarked headstones. I'm kind of at a loss for words

We head back to camp. Once we were back and settled in, and we had a good view because the sky was crystal clear and there was that full moon. After fifteen minutes or so of sitting there, I ask my uncle what time it was. He lights up his backlit watch to show me 2:59am. I sit there for another 30 seconds and think ""see, 3am and nothing."" Then, I hear faint screams coming from down the valley, where the school house field and headstones were. They get louder and louder as the screams get closer and closer. I say ""screams"" because they sounded JUST like a group of little girls and boys screams. When the full force of the screams get to us, I swear it seemed like they just stayed there, for at least 10-15 seconds. During this time I am completely frozen, every single one of us got up, food

It was a good 30 minute ride from home, and had nightmares all night.

During the third night in the hotel I suddenly woke up. Don't know exactly why, beautiful, blond lady sitting in a chair next to the bed. I immediately got up to a sitting position, rubbed my eyes and looked again. She wore black, lace nightgown or negligee. She had long hair cut in a fringe - almost exactly like [this](http://cdn.blogs.sheknows.com/celebsalon.sheknows.com/2008/08/anna-faris-the-house-bunny-new-york-premiere.jpg).


I was able to observe her for about twenty seconds. Unlike when awoken from a sleep and seeing night terrors, head tilted slightly upwards, like she was looking in the eternity. But her eyes were closed, and she has a gentle smile.


After some moments, I just said I had to go the the toilet. In the morning I asked about the night to make sure I wasn't sleeping and my wife confirmed that I had sat on the bed and then went to the toilet.

Ok...as promised

 

A couple little things happened at first. Objects would be out of place. The TV controller was moved from it’s usual spot. We’d hear what sounds like someone walking around the house at night or coughing coming from downstairs. The TV turned itself on a couple time. Then other things started happening….

Luke and I both left for work at the exact same time on this particular morning. The only one left in the house was our Loki. Luke had to come back to the house a couple hours later to grab something. Upon entering the house

A few days later, the laundry detergent is always sitting on top of the washing machine in the laundry room. This is about 10 feet from where the detergent was in the hallway. The washing machine was not on and even if it had been, the vibration would not be enough to send the detergent flying that far! About a month later we had gone out for the night. When we came home I noticed the laundry detergent was beside the kitchen sink. I asked Luke why he brought it upstairs and he said he hadn’t touched it.

On another night, he shook me awake, jumped out of bed and opened the door to see what was making the noise. No one was there. Our dog was beside our bed sleeping so he didn’t bump into the door to make the noise. We checked the entire house thinking maybe someone broke in. But there was no one.

Luke was in the shower the other day. He heard a noise while he was in the shower, he saw that the bathroom window had been opened. He was alone in the house.

 Another day, it EXPLODED!

I had gone out with some friends to do some last minute Halloween shopping. Luke called me in a panic… he said he was sitting outside our house because the door to the spare room just slammed shut on it’s own. Now

We recently got a new roommate... VICKERS! He was hanging out in the lower level of the house and got up to do something. He walked by his bedroom door and it slammed shut! I was upstairs and I thought he had tripped and fallen because it was such a loud bang.

This next ghostly tale was most likely a dream

Luke didn't tell me any of this until the next day.

Luke and I were sleeping... I had my arm under his pillow. Luke went to grab my hand and started rubbing it. Then he went to follow my arm back up under the pillow

So Luke went to sleep on the couch... just as he was drifting off

A couple weeks have gone by with no strange happenings...

And that leads us to yesterday's interesting occurence. I was the last to leave

We'll keep everyone updated with more ghost stories as they happen! Feel free to comment with a ghost story of your own :)

Jan 10

So we have a couple ghost updates. 

Back when Vickers was still our room mate, but even more confused about how they got there.  We had all gone to bed at the same time that night so unless one of us sleep walks it's a mystery!

October 2011 - My friend Ryan Collinson came down from Alberta to stay with us for our wedding.  Luke and I were busy running around one day doing wedding stuff so Ryan was at the house alone.  He decided to have a shower and while he was in the washroom he heard whistling coming from downstairs.  He thought maybe Luke had come home, but when the tv went from the show to a commercial the whistling still continued.  Weird...or what?

November 2011 - Luke an I were watching tv in the living room one night and we were talking about toy pianos and how they sound really cool and creepy.  Then the topic changed to a show I was watching about the real exorcism the movie 'the exorcist' was based on.  While we were talking about it we both heard a really weird creepy tune that seemingly came from nowhere.  It was only a few notes and it sounded like it was being played on a toy piano.  No joke!!  We both looked at each other like wtf...did you just hear that?

March 2012 - Luke was cleaning the house one day...I was at work

April 2012 - We now have a new roommate (Mat) and we didn't have a key made for him yet.  He was going to be at work until 130am the one night so he asked us to leave the door open for him since we'd already be in bed.  When Luke and I went up to bed I made sure to check the door.  It was unlocked.  About half an hour later I went down to grab a glass of water and again I made sure the door was unlocked.  At 130am I was woken up to a call from Mat who was locked out of our house!  Luke had to go down and unlock the door to let him in.

April 9

May 2013 - Shane was sleeping in our basement.  He woke up at 330am and had a weird feeling that he should look over at the lower level door.  As soon as he did it creaked all the way open.

When I first moved to New York City my then-boyfriend and I both moved into a very small ground floor studio apartment in a building that had been converted into living quarters from an old hospital.
One night, but after a little while I rolled over facing the rest of the room. Julie had gotten up, put on her coat and pulled up the hood. She was standing in the middle of the room, not moving. I thought this was odd since there was really no reason to get up, let alone put on her coat with the hood up.
""Julie
""I'm in bed.""
I looked down on the mattress and saw her lying there, was strangely calm and decided to just go to sleep. In retrospect I wonder why I didn't go screaming out of the room.
The next morning I told her about the strange dream
A few weeks later when I was walking out of my apartment an older woman from the neighborhood approached me. I live in a mostly Caribbean neighborhood and by and large people are mostly friendly, chat or what have you.
The woman asked me how long I'd been living in the apartment
Yes
""How long has it been an apartment instead of a hospital?""
I wasn't sure. I'd only been there less than a year.
""My husband died a few years ago in that hospital.""
I told her that I was very sorry for her loss and offered to say a prayer for her husband.
""Ok honey
I got a cold chill. There had been a few other incidents between the hooded spectre and meeting this woman

I'm not so sure anymore...

1354082617.0,13x6o5,"Apartment I lived in that everyone agreed was haunted. Of course, my room was the most active...",Numei,38,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/13x6o5/apartment_i_lived_in_that_everyone_agreed_was/

The apartment in question was in Ottawa, on a street called Bruyere. In respect of the rules I won't mention the exact address but wanted to mention the street in case someone has had some experiences there and would like to pm me. In fact, I met someone in a bar who started telling me about this apartment they lived in that was haunted and it ended up being the one I had lived in. Since I'd tried to rationalize what I saw, I even went as far as theorizing that it might be the effects of infrasound, it didn't bring me comfort to hear similar accounts from other tenants.  

So where to begin. There were the random weekly incidents that my roommates and I all shared such as, people thinking the place was covered in cobwebs then turning the lights on and seeing there were none, similarly there was one particular corner of the living room that people swore they saw some kind of cocoon thing clinging to but was gone when the lights went on, and overall just general bad vibes. Then there were my two out-and-out sightings. 

The first one happened as I just laid down for bed and looked up to see a solid green cloud hovering above me. As it got closer my face became increasingly cold and clammy. Then a loud yet distant whisper-shout ""DON'T!"" as the cloud lowered right onto me in a sudden final icy, woke thoroughly, saw how pale I was, and took me out for a drink. He took me quite seriously, and it took awhile before we screwed up the courage to head back.   

The second time, and thought someone had hung a shirt on my wall and grabbed for it. My hand went right though it, and as it floated into the ceiling, I could see in more detail that it was a dress with lace frills lightly glowing green like the cloud I'd seen before. Another freak out and outing for drinks. 

The person I'd met later on who said they'd lived there and seen things, the end of the great-room they'd seen things was where my room had been. The person didn't want to get into any details about what they'd seen.

* While waiting for our turn to enter the infamous room 502, but it wasn't any louder or quieter. It wasn't constant, either. I wanted to ask what that room used to be, but by the size of it, I'm guessing it wasn't much more than a storage room. If you watched the live Ghost Hunters Halloween show from Waverly, Jason had the same experience (which was after I had been there). I nearly pissed myself watching him experience the same thing.

* As we were about to enter room 502, since I had it running. Well... I'll be damned if it didn't. Right before she freaks out, you can hear the word ""yes"" being whispered. 

* While the group took a smoke break on one of the outside areas of the room... maybe the 5th floor. It's been a long time. Anyway, probably ambient light, and I remember a ladder (6' folding ladder). After my eyes adjusted I started to see shadows move in front of the light. It was only about 50 ft from me, possibly a little more. No noise (that I could tell), no noticeable shape. Just blocking out the light. The whole time I stood there it may have happened a 10-12 times. Other people caught on to what I was doing, so they began to look and saw it too.

* Ok... here's the biggie. Being a bit of a skeptic at heart, down a hallway lined with patient rooms, we had a chance to walk down the hallway alone. We remained in view of the group, but it was abotu 20-30 feet down the hallway. Everyone had to turn off their cameras and lights, so the only light was the ambient light from the moon. Of course I offered myself as sacrifice to the TB ghosts. I make my journey down with nothing to note. I turn and head back. About 2/3 of the way back I can see something. I didn't turn my head (I didn't want to give anything away), but I CLEARLY saw a shadow lean out from one of the patient rooms. Only chest and head, like someone peaking out from a doorway. That shape was there, I never turned my head) They confirmed what I saw. They saw it too. Told me where it was, it darted back into the room. I quickly sped up so I was in line with the doorway to see if anything (anyone) was inside the room

This started on April 3

Activity picked up when I visited his house over the summer for a week. We where at his mother's boyfriend's house when this happened. He slept in his bed and I slept on the air mattress. As soon as we lay down, magazines, rocks, something for clothes, my laptop, and the alarmclock. It took the fragrant spray for the hamster and was spraying us with that spray. We heard scratching on his bed but couldn't see any claw marks. It sounded like it was flicking my air mattress. All I saw was a black hand go and grab my face. It touched me in the head and poked me with paintbrushes. We thought that just the room was haunted after sleeping in it for 3 nights and the same things were happening. So we went into the living room to sleep and the ghost not only threw things but it moved the covers off me and it tugged on my pants and held them a ways away from me. And it punched me in my back twice.

After that my friend's mom and boyfriend slept in the living room with my friend and objects where hurled at them and the ghost touched the mother on her back. The boyfriend also got hit with objects. They also had a camera set up and it threw it. It also moved the couch.

My friend came over my house last weekend and DVD's, and my PS2 where all thrown at me. My friend bought a giant jaw breaker a while back and he brought it to my house. It was in a plastic bag and all we hear is 3 loud banging noises. Turns out that it was banging the jawbreaker against my bed post. So we put it in a plastic tote. Next thing we hear is the tote open and the bag of the jawbreaker. I ask my friend if it was in the tote and....it wasn't. This was the scariest moment of my whole life because this jaw breaker is big and heavy, and it will knock you out if it's thrown at you. We hid under our covers (which we do most of the time when this happens so we don't get really hurt) and it was lightly thrown at me. I shoved it into a drawer and it stayed there the whole night.  It also ripped one of my comic books, and used up my whole can of compressed air.

So far this ghost, it stops at 4 a.m every time (except last weekend when it was tearing up my room it stopped at midnight for some reason).

This is the most I could remember off the top of my head by myself.

My first REAL experience (in this house) was during the renovations, scaring me so much I fell backwards trying to stop. I gathered my things and didn't re-enter the house for a couple hours.

The next major experience was when my brother and I were sitting downstairs (after reno was complete) watching tv, but then, I looked over and saw my breadbox open, and a loaf of bread laying in the middle of the floor.

My next experiences were some of the scariest I had ever experienced. I was in my room trying to fall asleep as I had school in the morning but my sleep schedule was still set to weekend mode. My room in my house has only one window, who was also trying to sleep. So I am laying in my bed wide awake for at least 30 min, I roll over and face the doorway to my room and I see a shadow that was darker than my dark room. It was shaped like a person just standing watching me in the doorway. I automatically think its my brother and I say, ""Evan, what are you doing?"" I get no response. So I say it again, ""Evan! What are you doing, why are you in my room?!"". Then I hear him from the next room ""I'm not! I'm sleeping, there is definitely a person standing there

My next experience was similar to the last. I was sleeping in my bed when I'm woken up by movement on my bed. I open my eyes and turn over to see the exact same black figure sitting on the side of my bed

These are just some of the more major experiences I have had in my house. I don't really know a lot of people I can tell about my experiences as they are either no believers or I don't want to scare when they stay at my house.

So last night I go down in the basement to do laundry.  In the basement there are two ceiling lights.  They're both the kind where it's just a lightbulb with a pull cord.  I turn on the one that's next to the washing machine only.  As I'm loading the machine I notice that the room suddenly gets brighter and I look up and see that now the other light is on and it's pull cord is swinging back and forth wildly.  Although I wanted to run out of there badly

Now

I can't help but think that the ghost turned on the light because it wanted to send me some sort of message.  But why after a year long truce would this happen?  Is the message ""the truce is over""?  Another thing is that me and my husband have been talking about moving so maybe it's upset about that.  Or it could have just been trying to be helpful by turning on the other light for me.

A few years after my grandparents sold the house my brothers and I became friends with the kids that moved in to the same house, not his body. He would only linger at the doorstep with a depressed somber look on his face, they never saw him inside the house. They even told us he had spoken to them and said they were not welcome there.

Now to speak of the house I grew up in, and it would drive our dogs crazy. 

Also our ceiling fan light which was a dimmer would randomly turn on and off regardless of whether it was turned on. That could have been easily explained by an electrical problem, screamed, cursed and hollered at whatever the hell it was that was doing it. It stopped dead, never to this day has happened again(which is strange because the house has more electrical problems now than ever before).

 We did have some visuals in the house, it took him a while to go back down there and he mover his things back up stairs.

 This all felt normal to me for some reason, but I swear I would feel something cold either grab my ankle, grab my shoulders or grab my throat. When this happened I would cry uncontrollably for a couple seconds while I ran as fast as I could up the stairs. When I would go to bed I would watch the walls bleed to black from one corner to the other, so black it looked like a void. It filled me with terrible fear, something wanted me to know it was there.

When I was about eight or nine, and then all of a sudden she stopped, her eyes looked behind me with a glaze over them and all of a sudden something grabbed the back of my head and slammed my face into the exposed wooden chair arm. It chipped a good portion of my tooth off and my dog started whining and licking me. my mom was convinced I fell or that the dog had jumped on my back. But it was very real, in fact about a year ago, what felt like the same force slammed my head in to the corner of a doorway, it gave me a concussion and rattled my brain for about a week.

When I was around eleven or twelve I was very lonesome. my father and oldest brother had moved away, a graze on my cheek, a kiss on my forehead. This went on for a few years and when I was about thirteen I felt a kiss on my lips. I could have easily imagined it all, it was a concentrated tingle, almost like static electricity, but it kept me feeling safe, loved and happy

Other insignificant things have happened

Within days of purchasing the home, I noticed my husband do a quick glance up the landing. I asked him if he thought he saw something and he said yes.  So we both shared our stories about the movement - turns out we both had the exact same feeling.  It was a ghost of some sort, a young girl, and she was completely harmless.  Neither of us are spiritual whatsoever, but neither of us seemed to think it was odd that the other thought the same thing about the ghost, who I'll call The Girl from now on.

Over the years we have noticed company looking suddenly up the landing. Some we've asked if they thought they saw something and when they said yes

There is no other explanation for the movement. It's not light from anywhere

NOW. This is where things get crazy.  A couple of years ago at my daughter's birthday party (she was turning 10) I overheard a conversation between her and one of her friends.  Her friend said 'did you know you have a sister?'. I have one daughter and two sons...so no, you did have a sister. She died before you were born'.  She was saying this like it was just a boring old fact. My daughter got a weird look on her face and just changed the subject.  I was stunned. Absolutely stunned.  Because when my husband was in his early 20's, his girlfriend got pregnant and aborted the pregnancy.  

What do you think?

1350404629.0,11kr6m,My experience at my theatre in college. ,for_once,30,6,8,"I just found this sub and thought I should share my experience from my past few years at my college. 

I worked at the theatre on campus. Every single person who has spent time there has some sort of story of a haunting. 

I was working in the theatre past midnight one night. A few of my friends were with me. I walked past the room that holds the electronics for the building and see a man at the end of the hall. I go back a few steps and no one is there. The room does lead to the maintenance man's office but it is too late at night for him to be in. 

Another time I was alone working in the costume shop reupholstering some chairs. I was kneeling on the floor cutting some fabric when I hear footsteps behind me and someone touch my back. I turn to see if it was someone I knew who came in late to work but no one was there. I immediately left and didn't come back until the next day when I knew people would be in. 

Another night I was working late with one of my friends. We were sitting on the stage painting. We started hearing footsteps in the skywalks above us. The roof settles a lot but this was much different. We hear running around on the walks but no one was up there. We would have had to see someone walk up there from where we were. 

The creepiest by far I did not witness but many of my co workers did. They were working over spring break to finish up the set and suddenly they hear drums coming from the orchestra pit. The drumming has been heard before but never this much or this loudly. The pit is always kept empty of all instruments unless we are doing a musical (which we were not). And the only way to get to the pit is to crawl through a small tunnel in the costume shop. Much too hard to get a drum in there. The drumming continues on and off for the next few days. Finally

Other than these experiences many others have been working and all the lights went off or blink on and off. Many others have been touched. I have since graduated but I'm sure the experiences have continued since I have left.

My Grandma Helen practically raised me, so there was no violent trauma involved or anything.

About a month after she had gone, him plunging one side of the sink and me bailing on the other. After 15 minutes or so of this frustrating activity, I heard my Grandma's voice call ""Sarah?"" from the direction of the house that her room was in (the tone of her voice was questioning, like ""Sarah? Are you there?""). 

Well, but even over the fixing of the sink the sound was plain as day. I just froze, and turned to look at Richard. Even as weird as the situation was, I kept silent and remember thinking to myself ""let HIM be the one to mention it - 1. So I know I'm not crazy, and 2. So I won't be implanting suggestions into his head"". So I look over at Richard, and he says, ""did you hear that?"". LOL what an overwhelming relief that was! 

Of course, she'd have to come visit me. I honestly believe now that she did. Richard was a lot more traumatized by it than I was, as his world view doesn't make allowances for anything illogical... I'm so thankful that this experience was shared, because what they say is true: nobody will ever really believe stuff like this, until it happens to them.

A lot of the TV shows that are on, because there is just too simple an explanation for things like that ( dust floaters in the air for example, or someone walking past a light in the other room throws an odd shadow) and I don't really believe when I see that someone got 'scratched' that a ghost did it--however, there are certain stories and pictures that I have seen and heard that I do not believe can be explained by anything other than the paranormal.

I have had two strange experiences in my life that I feel there is no rational explanation for:


I was house sitting with my then GF, but nothing was there...my eyes popped open...I could feel the presence in the room coming from near the foot of the bed. Before I could say anything, she asked me, 'hey do you feel like we should leave?"" Before she could finish asking the question, I had already answered with an emphatic ""YES"" and was up out of bed, getting dressed.

We followed the light for 30 minutes and eventually pulled over on the side of the road as it flew right over our heads. We both snapped pictures of the strange thing in the sky and flipped shit when we looked at them... We both captured the bright light and what looks like a face that is eerily similar to my dad's.

I work for a DPW on Cape Cod

It was to be a 15 ft wide path for the Fire Department to have access to in case of emergency to the river. 
We cut all the trees down and layed them to each side of the path to be chipped
Just as we started chipping I turned to get a branch to throw into the chipper and I saw
Just as I turned to tell my foreman to check out these people in the woods
As we continued I felt this intense heavy feeling of depression come over me. I wanted to cry
I start to tell everyone what I saw. Just as I finish telling them about the woman and child, it was a bright white-yellow in the middle with a blue ring on the outside. It was midway up the trees on the opposite side of the river and it moved left to right up the river and disappeared into the woods. 
Just as soon as the light disappeared we all heard drums beating in the same direction that the light was coming from. These drums were deep and they went off in beats of three for 10 minutes or so. We all sat and listened
This area of the woods there is no houses at all. It's all conservation land and has been untouched for a long time. The Native who was working with us told us it was tradition to bury people along the river. 
We continued chipping and I still had this depressed feeling, this intense rush of heat came over my back. This was hot, like I was standing with my back to a fire. I could feel the heat through my jacket and sweatshirt and it went away. I felt nothing after that. 
Clearly something was not happy with us working near that river.

When i was about 4 or 5 i began to see things in the middle of the night. Shadow like figures flying across my bed. Loud noises. I would hear voices talking in the middle of the night whispering. I once saw a shadow like figure pull out a white sword and aim it at me. Needless to say i kept pretty quiet about it and i was scared shitless if i was ever alone. Showers were pretty scary up until i was about 13. This minor activity keep going on until about the age of 7 or 8 when i would feel something invisible poke my forehead in the middle of the night. i would wake up not see anything and i ignored it for a very long time. This got worse and lights began to flicker on and off in the middle of the night and my mom came in one time and saw the lights having issues. We unplugged my lights and i didnt have an issue that night. I was so scared at this point by everything i was seeing i was sleeping in my moms bed until the age of 12. But ill continue.

Around the age of 9 or 10 when i was sleeping with my mom i saw something down the hallway. There was a giant fire in the middle of the hallway!! i woke my mom up immediately and told her the house was burning!! SHE DID NOT SEE A DAMN THING! as i stared at this fire for long amounts of time the fire would start to shift into a man like figure. I kept waking my mom up and she kept saying she didn't see anything. I eventually got to sleep.

I told my grandmother my stories the next day only to find out my grandmother was the local exorcist for our church and she would teach me how to take care of things in the house. She taught me how to bless the house and how to tell the things in the house to leave. She told me stories of things that would grab her in the middle of the night and how she never had anyone to help her because her parents were Lutheran. Me and her did the blessings and everything was gone! i swear by it i have not had many issues since then. The shadows stopped the things stopped poking me the lights havent had any issues.

But every now and then something will get knocked over in them middle of the night or a door will open by itself and i have to stay strong and confident that god will take care of it. (sorry to get religious its how i feel and it works)

My grandmother told me that in the bible they describe spiritual gifts that effect us all. She said they are passed down from generation to generation

I just wanted to finally share my story and i hope people have some info to give and i would love to talk about this with other people.

I've recently started working at a store in my hometown rumored to be haunted.
Many people have offered money to stay the night in the store
actually made a movie about the store. I'm just going to share a few of my own personal experiences
and a few stories and background of the store.


One of the first things I did when I started working was get the grand tour from one of the other employees. Upstairs there is a room where the previous owner used to live, but it's what I was told).


My first experience with the ghosts was later one night at around 8:30 pm


The next thing I experienced was upstairs, but both pairs of skis all of a sudden came crashing down on the ground and were spread out on the floor. They didn't slide against the wall because they were leaned against a shelf, they had appeared to been thrown off the wall.


The next and last of my personal stories was again later at night this time at around 8 pm. This happened just a week or so ago. Again we had just 3 people in the store. The scheduled manager couldn't close for whatever reason so we were left in charge for the last hour, and it was definitely footsteps. The creaks were timed out, you could tell it wasn't a person because you couldn't hear the sound of shoes, just the wood creak. My coworker looked at me and I back at him, and asked if I had heard them and I said yes. We knew no one was here because we had checked the entire store, and so we locked up and left.


This story actually comes from my mom, an employee checking to see if she needed help and then he went back downstairs. A few minutes later she heard more footsteps coming up the stairs but no one had come up, and no one went down. She blew it off, not quite sure if she had heard something or if it was someone coming up and back down, but then she saw it. She saw a figure, a woman, in a white dress, go right through the doorway and then the door swung shut. She just stared at it as it crossed the room

My parents house was/is a happy home. It really was. Lived there was my dad, but just a little odd. I don't know how it got brought into conversation but one day it did. My brothers said they all experienced the same thing, at the same time.
I also used to see a middle aged man. i would never see his face

One time me and my mum had stayed up watching a movie. Realising it was quite late we decided to get ready to go to bed. I went to get a glass of water from the kitchen and heard my mum going up the stairs. I followed shortly after and whilst i was climbing the stairs i saw my mum go into the conservatory which i thought was rather odd. I started shouting ""mum"" to get her attention but nothing, no one. That scares me every time i think about it because i've never seen a ghost...or whatever it was open a door or touch anything. By the way, this happened at 4am.

Another time me and my mum were up late whist she was cutting and colouring my hair for me, it would go away. All of a sudden my mum starts giggling to herself. I asked her what was up and she just says without batting an eyelid ""he's here"" My eyes started watering and i felt like running away haha. But we ended up making light of it. Because even though you can sense it, he's never actually done anything to harm any of us. I think whoever it is, hes just stuck. OH and it was at 4am this all happened.

The last experience i will speak of is i went to visit my parents not long ago and i was talking to my mum on her bed, i have never felt fear like i have that night. i instantly went from being half asleep on my mums bed to running out of her room screaming for my life and i locked myself in the bathroom. All of while this was happening my three brothers ran to my aid to see what was one. One of my brothers however was shouting ""GET THEE HENCE"" When i had calmed down i sat down with my brother and asked him why he said that. I am telling you guys the truth when i say this. His reply said as soon as he heard my screams he got this feeling of utter and complete dread all over him. Not scared for me, but dread. I asked why he felt dread and he said he knew i had seen something bad. I told him i was half asleep and seen something coming at me from the ceiling and he said he saw the same thing...finding this hard to believe i asked him to draw what he saw and i would draw what i saw and then show them to each other. WE DREW THE SAME FREAKING THING. By the way, this happened at 4am.

And now for some of my experiences. A few months after i moved in, i looked at one of the windows and i swear i was staring at a figure. There were no features, but an outline of a body and what seemed to be a cane. Now here's the weird part. A few days later i asked my fiance if his dad ever used a cane. He told me later in life he did after his first stroke and asked me why i wanted to know. Like i said, i never met this man in life.

Around the same time, i laid there trying to figure it out since we had no animals living with us at the time and there was no vent near the papers. I was exhausted so I shrugged it off and tried to fall asleep. It was extremely hot so i threw the comforter off and had the sheet on me, pulled up to my shoulder. I finally got comfortable and was about to pass out when the sheet was yanked down! We were both not moving so it was not us. Of course, i woke up my fiance and told him and he said yeah it was probably dad. I sleep topless so he made jokes that he was trying to see my breasts.

On Valentines Day last year, and were talking when all of a sudden the end of the dress(which was barely covering my bottom) was flipped up onto my back. Of course I jumped up and my fiance asked what was wrong so i told him. He laughed and said it was definitely his dad.

I was studying abroad in Germany with a group of other college students. Five of us were on a train from Amsterdam back to Bielefeld after a weekend trip. The train was packed, I heard a whisper in my ear saying my name, ""Dave."" I didn't know anyone sitting around me and I am sure none of them knew my name. I immediately had a feeling of terror come over me. All I could think at that moment was that I had to get home and fast. After the train stopped, I rushed to grab the closest street car back to my bus route. I didn't even stop to meet back up with my friends before jumping on the car. After I finally got off of the last bus on what seemed to be the longest trip back to my host-parents, I walked into the house. My host family was sitting in the living room looking very sad. My host mother stood up and muttered in German, ""Call your family."" When I got a hold of my dad, he told me that my brother, had been killed by a suicide bomber. The news was absolutely crushing. My brother and I had been best friends our entire life. He had died the night before I heard the news. None of us had a cell phone

I never really got to know my grandfather. Sure, a big one at that. I remember everytime we'd visit he'd have a pipe or cigar in his mouth. I didn't think much of it to be honest (Both my parents smoked, although my mother was pregnant at the time with twins) but it wasn't until my grandpa died of cancer that things started happening. From what I can remember it started with the phone calls. Sometimes there would be 3-5 a day. My mom or step-dad would answer them and no one would be on the other line. I remember my parents discussing it and how eerie it was. This continued on for awhile until we decided to get our home phone removed. Then it got even weirder, see the grandfather clock would go off when it wasn't supposed to and lights would start magically turning on and off in the hallway. It was then that it started affecting me. I remember one night I was laying in bed and suddenly heard footsteps in my room. I was petrified, I couldn't move! Then the freaking handle to my dresser would start to jingle. Being nine years old, I was already afraid of the dark so this just made everything worse. Haha, I'd sleep in my parents room for weeks I was so afraid of my room. Now from what I remember. All this didn't happen all at once. It was random and would stretch on for several months (this was during late 2004, some weeks nothing happened. But it wasn't until the beginning of july  that my mother gave birth to my twin sisters prematurely. After that everything stopped and nothing has happened since then. The creepiest part about it?

I have experienced ghosts all my life but nothing compared to what happened there...
There were three events in particular that I'll never forget. I'll preface these by telling you I lived in the basement, somehow I knew someone was watching me from the top of the steps. As I turned around it was like the ghost, or entity, or whatever it was knew I was aware of it and tried to move into the living room to avoid being seen. However, before it did I saw a grey hand quickly disappear through the doorway (minus the door). I got the vibe it didn't want to be seen...shaken, I went to bed and tried to get some sleep.
  Not long after this first occurrence my good friend and roommate, which was separated from the living room by a hallway that ran from the doorway, went right, then to the steps the went to the basement. I felt that sensation again that I was being watched and looked up. This time I saw what I think was a full body apparition. Her hair was floating out away from her head, she wore what I guess would be a night gown and her toes were dangling almost touching the floor and again, she was entirely grey and I couldn't make out any facial features...I remembering my mouth dropping open in shock trying to point...I was trying to focus, taking in more details, where your eyes cant quite make out what your seeing no matter how hard you concentrate. As I moved my hand to point
  The final thing that I experienced is something that, and had just finished watching a movie, it was probably around 1:30 in the morning...As I got up off my couch to turn off the the tv when I, once again, got incredibly cold and the hair stood up on my arms and neck. As I clicked the remote and the tv shut off, a ball of light zoomed down and to the right behind my head/shoulders, then cut back to the left across my lower back into the wall. I saw this because it reflected off the black tv screen. Then I got the feeling that something was watching me from the corner of the room farthest from me. I remember slowing sitting back down on my couch
  All of these experiences had two things in common. First, after we moved out one of the six people that moved in after us approached one of my roommates and asked if it was haunted- describing how her cat, upon moving in, would get inches away from the wall in her room(her room was on the 3rd floor near the creepy bathroom with attic access) and start meowing for hours on end in a very weird tone/pitch, just staring at the wall.

When I was 17 years old, just days after he died. I tell a lot of people this story, and no one seems to really believe me until I show them the picture.

A few days after Kramer died, him looking around since he could see the kitchen, living room, front door, etc. all from this spot. Anyways, I was standing in the kitchen and for whatever reason, I felt inclined to snap a photo using my Sony Ericsson s710a which was my cell phone at the time. I just looked up, and went on my way. Didn't think anything of it.

A few weeks later, and I understand it's all about interpretation,  I can see him sitting in the corner of the basket, his nose making a darker spot facing forward. Using his nose as your guide point, you can make out his head and body. I've debated what position he is actually laying in but either way, to me, the head is clearly there.

Again, I've showed this picture to people without the red box and said, what do you see, and I've had 100% success rate of people saying there is a ghost or a shadow in the dog bed.

I was 16

We parked across the street of this sprawling, long field, with a water tower at the corner, and across the far right street is the parking lot of a grocery store. We walked across the street and ducked into the darkness of the field. It was cold, and a tad blustery, but not bad for November around here. We 4 walked arm in arm, across this field, but as we got up to the building

Once we were in, and took turns sitting in chairs long abandoned. At the end of the hall, we took the stairs up. They were wooden, and covered in what looked to be like drywall dust. It was mounding up on the corners with pieces of wall and glass. On the second floor, it was easier to hear the wind. The glass in the window at the end of the hall would shake when the wind blew. At this point we are finding abandoned beds and what looks like drawings on the walls. We reach another staircase and go up again. The third floor, seeming rather identical to the second, was skipped, and top

The staircase was in the middleish of the main hallway, swinging doors that were at the end of an enclave about 4 feet deep. Each doorway had one door, about 2 feet wide, on hinges to the right, and a small square window at head level. I pushed the door to go in, but it was locked. I peered through the doors window and saw nothing but a large, empty black room with a window directly across from the door on the wall. I could see the field outside. We all stood in the hallway discussing where we wanted to go next. 

It was me, investigating something, while the two guys talked. Then, and I'll never forget this, something walked past the window in the room with the locked door. Dude1 stops talking. Dude2 in the doorway notices our faces and backs away from the door. My friend is getting further down the hall to the left, and dude2 says, ""did you guys see something?"". Just as he stops talking, to the end of the hall. dude2 takes off down the hall for my friend to the left. I remember thinking, puffing rhythmically like someone walking down the steps. Classic old-movie style, when we hear my friend and dude2 SHRIEKING. Not ""aaahhh I'm scared hold me bro"" but ""AH! AH! AH! AH! HOLY SHIT"" as if they are seeing something freaky.

Around when I was about 12, I did a little researching of the house and to see if anybody died in that house..well lo and behold there was a massive house fire back in the 1800's a family died a mom, dad (he was a farmer), and a little boy. What is really creepy..they all have the same last name as my family and I! We are not related to them at all.  
  My mom constantly was haunted by the same farmer numerous times. One night I was at a friend's house and my dad was at work like always.. and it was just my mom and my baby brother which was about 4 at the time. She was giving my brother a bath.. he suddenly moved his head and said ""dad?"" and my mom said that she yelled ""steve is that you?"" and she left the bathroom to check..and nobody was there. Another instance of the farmer ghost his name was Eli Riley, bony, and really skinny as a rail. He had on overalls with no shirt. He just looked away from my mom and walked through a doorway and he turned to go upstairs..by the way that was my room
  Another creepy thing happened upstairs, so it wasn't a big deal for me to be home by myself for a while. My dad was working since 6 am and hasn't been home yet. My mom was gone since 7ish. I was the only child at the time too. Anyways..I went to get a snack and brought it upstairs to play in my room. I had this old recliner chair in the corner of the room. I always sit in it when i eat my snack and watch or listen to music. I leaned over to the side to flip the foot rest and i felt an empty box of graham bear crackers. There wasn't any plastic inside it to hold the crackers...I was like ""hmm where did the hell did this come from?"" NOBODY in my family including myself doesn't like graham bear crackers in the first place lol. By the way I didn't see it in the morning before I left for school. The house was locked up tight as a safe too! So I asked my mom and dad about it and they said we never even buy that stuff. 
I've seen shadows lurking around in my newly remodeled room on the first floor. An interesting finding
Here is the most creepiest thing about the house ever: my parents told me this like a year after we finally moved out of the haunted house. They told that my room on the first floor was a funeral showing room! The house used to be a funeral home..ugh. I know they were telling the truth because my dad reminded me that when we were remodeling the room

1336104388.0,t6c57,Lived in haunted house in NZ for a few years,waikakaboy,19,4,9,"What follows is a true story

I was born in 1986 and lived in Waikaka, and my Dad was a sheep-farmer. The house we lived in was situated on a sheep farm in the tiny rural town of Waikaka in southern New Zealand. The house was actually built by my Dad's father.

The hauntings started when I was approx. 6-7 years old. I am actually unsure exactly how old I was when the haunting started. I know for a fact that we moved off of the farm a week or two after I turned 9 years old.

The first night it happened: My Dad was at the local pub. My Mum, my mother got into an argument with my siblings. I can’t remember the exact impetus for this argument, but nevertheless, my Mum sent my siblings off to bed. Eventually we went to bed too. I shared a room with my brother, our parents room was adjacent to it, and my sister had her own room at the end of the hallway from our rooms. I’m not sure how much time passed from the time my Mum and I went to bed, but at same point, ran into our Mum’s room, had heard this breathing in her room as well.  I haven’t the foggiest idea of how long it lasted. 

Our Mum rung up the pub that my Dad was still at and told him to get his butt home. He came home and upon hearing out story, the breathing had stopped. At some point, he rung up the neighbors (who live approx. 1-2 km away from us), and asked them if they had spotted any prowlers on their property that night (he thought it was an actual person, not something spooky). After that, for some reason, my parents thought it would be a good idea to bring the dog inside. I remember they called the dog (JR was his name), but would not come into the house. JR was visibly shaking and had his tail down between his legs. Eventually

Every month or two, and it would scare the jeepers out of us all. For some reason, it took quite a while (as in months) until our Dad actually experienced it for himself. He was invariably either (a) working on the farm if it was during the day, or (b) at the local pub if it was night.

Most of my memories of these experiences have faded dramatically over the years. One which I remember quite well is as follows. My Mum was out that night at some sort of church thing (she may have actually been seeking advice that particular night on how to deal with whatever it was in our house). I was alone in my bedroom reading a large book, and the All Blacks are out national team). I was in my bed, derping around reading my book, when I hear the deep heavy breathing we had become accustomed to emanating from a corner of my bedroom. It happened once. I froze up terrified. I thought to myself that if I just ignore it, it will go away. No such luck. It breathed again. At this point, I jumped out of bed, ran down the hallway , to the lounge and told my Dad and siblings. My Dad had been drinking and just yelled at me to get my butt back to bed (I am pretty sure at this point he still hadn’t experienced it for himself and so didn’t really believe us that there was something spooky in the house). I could tell from the looks on my siblings faces that they believed me, she ripped my Dad a new a-hole for telling me to go back to bed.

While living on the farm, but during the day, on multiple occasions, my Mum felt cold breezes swirl around her while she would be in the house. These naturally freaked her out and she would just go wait outside until Dad would come in from farming or we would come home from school.

On at least one occasion she heard a distinct voice. My Mum, she came back through to the lounge, yelling at us, demanding to know who it was who snuck up behind her in the hallway and started whispering “mummy” to her. None of us had left the room for the entire duration of the call. And she was adamant she heard a child whispering behind her while on the phone. 

Anyway, were just the deep heavy breathing kind, so I won’t bother to go into detail on each occurrence that I remember. Though, I will say, that I detected a pattern as to when these manifestations would occur. It seemed to always be after an explosive argument, typically involving my Mum. One humorous incident I remember is that one night my sister came and slept with me in my bed as she was too scared to sleep in her own room. I woke up in the middle of the night sometime and really really had to pee, but was too scared to even think about going to the toilet (which was halfway down the hallway). So I did what anyone would do in such a situation… I pee’d my bed with my sister in it. She understood in the morning when she woke up and I told her what happened.

Eventually, who gives a crap). We sold the farm and moved to the neighboring town of Gore in June 1995. Thankfully, whatever that thing was, it did not follow us (I think).

Once we moved off of the farm, she said she awoke in the middle of the night and saw an angelic figure at the side of her bed. It touched her and said something like, “Don’t worry, everything will be alright.” At the time she had no idea what it meant, but she now believes (as I do) that it was there to reassure her that no harm would come to us in what was about to occur with the evil entity.

Earlier this year I went to NZ with my wife. I went out with my mum one afternoon and we talked for a long time about all of this stuff. She told me a couple of other things that happened to her that I had never heard before. One night she heard the breathing creep up alongside her bed. Her arm was dangling out on the side of the bed, ever, sleeps with her arms or legs dangling off the bed. On another occasion, she said she had an ominous feeling about my sister. So that night, she had my sister sleep in her room, while she slept in my Sister’s room. During the night, my Mum woke up to something strangling her. She prayed in her head and eventually the choking stopped.  She thinks that if my sister had of been sleeping in her own bed that night

It is hard to do justice to how terrifying these experiences were

Feel free to ask any questions but I won’t be able to answer them for a while as I’m going to bed now. Also

TL;DR – Lived in a haunted house during the age of 6-9. Whole family experienced an evil entity on many occasions. I only remember experiencing regular occurrences of deep heavy breathing. Mum experienced the worst of it. Deeply affected my entire life and still think about it almost every day (I am now 25).

1325112895.0,nu5fi,My friends and I no longer talk about this subject since my sighting.,Shamyrock,17,1,5," Two years ago I had my first and only ghost sighting while camping with my friends. We got freaked out and now never talk about

 I think it was during summer, it was quite a cold night so most of the lads were sitting in the tent. Me and my friend however were sitting on top of the hay stack over looking the tent chatting quietly. Suddenly one of the lads in the tent started yelling at us ""Stop sneaking around outside! I can hear you!"". We yelled down a few times saying that we were nowhere near. My friend eventually got down to show him exactly where we were before returning to the top. A few minutes later the same guy started yelling saying that he could hear us again sneaking around and see our shadow on the tent. We were really confused at this stage and just ignored it really, occasionally replying with usual "" we are nowhere near"". Later we went down to join them in the tent. It was already quite full at this stage but it was a big one. We sat in a kind of entrance hall thing were normally I just put my shoes. The outside door was broken so was open. After a bit of chatting I saw something in the corner of my eye, what I saw was a kind of blue aura surrounding a figure wearing what looked like tanned trousers, they reminded me of the old potato sacks. I was taken aback but figured I just imagined it. We continued talking but then I sensed movement beside me and heard a whisper that sounded like my surname with some other stuff I couldn't really hear properly and jumped up out of the tent immediately to see who was trying to freak me out but saw nothing. I then told people what I saw but they looked at me as if I was trying to play a bad joke. Since my friends didn't believe it I figured I must have imagined it but was still kinda iffy. I saw the same thing again a few minutes later, hearing my name again and dived in for the back of the tent yelling that something was there between a crap load of swearing. Not trying to tute my own horn but I don't scare easily but my friends saw that I was scared, they said I looked pale. They also knew I didn't believe in ghosts,,True,t3_nu5fi

1350140737.0,11ez7p,A few of my most convincing experiences!,PunkinGuts,19,5,6,"I stayed in my boyfriends parent's house about a year ago for two months after coming home from a job in alaska (I was 22).  Their house is somewhat old (built in 50's or 60's) and has an odd history.   The man that lived in it before them built the house and lived there with his wife until my boyfriends family moved in in 1997.  Apparently this man's wife died of a heart attack but he didn't call the police or ambulance until three days after she died

It was night time and I was having trouble getting to sleep though my boyfriend was passed out next to me.  I am laying staring at the ceiling when I hear footsteps outside my door (they have creaky wood floors).  At first I thought it was his older brother who lived across the hall from us, the light shines in under my door as I am adjacent to the bathroom.  I strain my ears to see if I can hear anything in the bathroom, no movement in there, no sound of running water or someone using the toilet.  The light turns off (it is a switch on the wall that is rather hard to click on and off) and so I wait to hear the footsteps leave the bathroom...I hear nothing. At this point I am petrified and in a cold sweat...nothing more happened that night.

A week or so later my boyfriend and I get in some sort of argument and I can't sleep again.  So I leave our bedroom in the middle of the night and go to the living room on the other side of the house to watch some TV.  I lay on the ground in front of the TV and watch a couple episodes of a show on netflix and now it is just after 3:00am. I feel a strange sensation and then I hear someone sit down in the big reclining chair about 5 feet behind me

This last experience in the house was actually by my boyfriends dad from when they first moved in.  All of the bedrooms are located down a hallway which ends into the master bedroom. At the front of this hallway used to be a door (that has since been removed).  In the early mornings when he would get up he would be doing things in the kitchen like making breakfast and whatnot and would hear someone walking very fast in heels down that hallway towards the door and then abruptly stop. The first few times it happened he thought it was his wife

NOTE: I am about 4 weeks away from moving back into that house for a few months...I wonder if I should try and make any contact or just leave the spirits be?

I have had a few experiences

I stayed home from work two Friday's ago to clean up our house for an insurance inspection

I've drawn you a map in paint so you can get an idea of the layout of the upstairs -&gt; http://imgur.com/EqR1B (i'm sorry about my abysmal drawing skills, and yes, my bathroom is bigger than the bedrooms) 

Our house was built sometime between 1886 and 1903. We've been living there for almost ten years, I've seen ""mist"" a few times... normal ""ghostly"" things like that, but never a full out apparition.

So I'm tidying away, and go to rinse my cloth out in my bucket which was sitting in the doorway of the front bedroom so I can wipe down the windowsill. I look down the hall for whatever reason and see my reflection (just a silhouette) in the frosted glass in the bathroom window. I think ""man I look like shit, I should fix my hair"" when I notice something kinda moving ""around"" my reflection. When all of a sudden BOOM a silhouette kinda bends around me at hip level (this is all in the window reflection) sticks it's arm and hand out, gives me a jazz hand wave (you could see all the fingers! It was pretty much a perfect silhouette from the waist up), and disappears.  

I just sort of stood there slack jawed

The blackness is what gets me. I have never seen something so black in my entire life. I didn't feel threatened

I was the only one home. Our house is 2 stories tall

I've been trying, and trying to debunk this. I've been trying different combinations of lighting at different times of day to see if i can even get a reflection of ""me"", which I have, but you can see my face, nothing that's all black like what I saw

It must have been about three years ago.  My ex-girlfriend and I were riding in my car back to my place at around 2am.  The house is in a rural area in the panhandle of Florida.  The road we were on comes to a Y at which we can continue straight or veer to the left to go towards my house.  Immediately after taking the left, I think I must be seeing a panther.  After all, there are panthers in this area of Florida, and although rare, sightings do occur.  However, as my eyes adjust to this object I notice that it is not a panther at all.  The length, height and color of this object made me think of a panther.  It is about 5 feet long, and black.  I then think that it must be a cloud of smoke from an unseen fire in the woods to the left of the road.  I soon dismiss that idea when I realize it is moving across the road from left to right, black, did not break up until completely disappearing at the end of its movement

We did this every day. On Wednesday however I had overdone it. I had a headache and went to bed early [about 21:00h]. Once in bed, where the Moon shone its light and illuminated most of the room. I was in the bed on the right side. In front of me were the door and on the left was a basin.
As I was lying there
However
This was strange enough
I was interested. Even as a young person, the apparition would be gone [evidence of headache induced imagery] or the ghost would still be there [proof of actual ghost?- hey, I was only 14].
So I switched the light  on and obviously everything was gone
So after a few minutes with my eyes closed and light switched off

I wasn't scared at all at this point. She seemed ""nice"".
However, the grey bun.
After a while staring at each other
I still wasn't scared.
However when she reached the bed and literally stood next to my head

What did I do?
I screamed and turned round

Fast forward next morning. We were having breakfast and obviously we were sitting within our peer group. When most of us were gone
I took the opportunity and took a seat next to her to ask her more questions. 
Now she was in the 5 bedroom right next to ours
I did not tell her anything but asked what she had seen
I did ask her if she was ""working""?
But the girl said that the woman was just standing there. Looking at her.
Now remember that I had not told anyone about this. 

Basically
We were gobsmacked
Together we went to the landlady and asked her if there was anything in the history of this old cottage that could pinpoint to an old lady.
But we were fobbed off

This is all we could find out...I.e nothing.
The landlady and her husband had only ran tho

I did several searches on Google about the place

Anyway
Alexis was always getting up in the night and getting into trouble. She'd raid the fridge or knock something over while climbing up on something. She like to get up in the night and raid the kitchen because she knew everyone was asleep and she could get away with it.  This particular night I happened to be up at 2 am on the computer.  I see Alexis sneak into the kitchen with my peripheral vision and she froze when she saw me. And just stood there.  I didn't look at her or pay her attention. I figured she had seen me...she knows she's caught....hopefully she will go back to bed and go to sleep without me having to make a big deal of it.  So she stands there for about 3 minutes

From the time I was born until I was 16, especially alone and especially at night. The development of this feeling I had about the house coincided with my family life having completely crumbled when I was about 12 - my parents were going through a very bitter divorce and my older brother moved out, leaving me alone in the house with my mom, who at the time was struggling with extremely destructive alcoholism, manic depression, and (IMO) more extreme psychological issues. As you can imagine, since I was an adolescent at the time, anger

In any which case, severely unwelcoming. My friends didn't like to visit anymore and preferred their own homes instead for our sleepovers, etc.; they told me my house was creepy and ""felt weird"" even though my house had previously been our main headquarters. Large enough, lots of games to play, acreage, etc. etc. I know my mom being in the state that she was didn't help my preteen social life, but I felt the house's descent of creepiness too.

Quick sidenote: if you'd like to envision the layout of our house, and dining room. My bedroom branched off the middle of the hallway. The basement isn't especially relevant to this story, apart from the fact that it made me the most uneasy of all and I avoided it at all costs once my brother moved out of it.

Anyway, so there was no explanation for them - but they happened. I can recall several different times that I just heard footsteps going up and down the hallway. Very soft footsteps. It was terrifying, and being a 22-year-old now, I still feel the need to sometimes sleep with lights or the television on.

The footsteps went on without change and I dealt with it without telling anyone. However, considering my mom was a teacher in a district a ways away and wouldn't get home until an hour after me. It was a fall day and no windows were open, no air conditioner running, nothing - just myself and silence. All of a sudden, our kitchen pantry door slammed shut with so much force that a rack of items hanging on the back of it (including a pair of scissors, which I have no clue why we thought was a good idea) fell to the ground. It made such an awful crash that I screamed and bolted out of my seat.

After the briefest of investigations, but nothing real came of it.

Needless to say, though I heard it was purchased and renovated.

To this day, but there's no rationality I can come up with to reason with the footsteps or the door slamming with that much force. Sometimes I do wonder if it's a possibility the awful dissolution of my family life and all the severe negativity that came with it for several years attracted a bad sort of energy - maybe not a poltergeist, but an otherworldly type of sufferer who fed off our sad household.

Oh well - it makes for a decent story

Here is the story that stood out to me...

-Post from SC_Lawman-
Myself and a buddy on my squad responded to an alarm. The incident location was an old office type building that had been converted to doctor's offices. There was a pharmacy attached to it. Our dispatch received a motion signal from an upstairs office. Key holder arrives on scene and we go in to secure the building. The stairs were locked behind a door that, so we took the elevator up to the second floor (not the most tactically sourd option, I know).

Elevator opens to a pitch black hallway... except for one overhead light at the end of the hall. We start checking doors, the door is unlocked. We make entry and observe it to be an unused office. The door opend to a sizable waiting room and reception area. There were about 10 or 12 exam rooms, all cleared with no hiccups.

We exit the office and immediately, ""Weren't all those doors we just checked closed and locked."" I tell him yay, so. Buddy says, ""Well now they're all standing open."" Sure enough, all the offices down the hallway we had just checked were now standing open. Pucker factor sinks in at this point. 

So we start clearing offices and securing offices. We finish the last office, the main door just slams shut. Then, our radios start going nuts with some kind of static feedback. Now I just want to get the hell out of there. 

We get back in the elevator and head down to the first floor to make contact with the key holder again. However

I call dispatch and she tells me that there is no way we were out with a key holder. She states that the alarm company had only just made contact with one. Eventually

I still won't go back there.",self,t5_2r1q4,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/fk41k/ghost_story_from_the_police_forum_thread_thank/

Fast forward about a year. At this point I am having sleeping problems, I go back to watching tv, but my guard is up. a few minutes later: BAM! The door swings open about ninety degrees, blocking the hall to it. At this point, I grab a shoe (though, I don't know why I didnt grab the iron fire poker) and sneak around to the other entrance to the kitchen and hallway to find nothing in the garage. The car entrance is closed, the entrance to the dog fence is blocked off and the door to the back yard is locked and shut tight.

Another few months later, hulking figure with blood red eyes starts moving towards me at an alarming rate. And I wake up with sleep paralysis. I cant move, I can barely breath. and I cant scream when I see the man with the red eyes by my desk moving towards my brother. When I do sit up and yell, he vanishes.

Later on, especially in the lower floor. After my aunt remarried, her new husband found all the lights on in the lower floor when no one had gone down. A cousin, alerted his mom that there was a customer for berries in the house, when he saw the figure of an old, bald man, come down the stairs to the lower floor.

Anyway
My job there was to check up on the state of the bedrooms when our guests left, which usually were left with their door opened. Some people locked up the rooms, but as I had a master key this was no problem. 

However, as if there was another key in the lock from the other side. I noted that, went on with my walkthrough and later came back down to my coworker. I asked him to show me the key to the specific room and it wasn't there; which was odd as the guest had signed our key receipt list. 

I showed him the situation and we couldn't manage to open the door. We tried to open it with the old credit card trick. It didn't work, there was the key on the inside of the door. We immediately searched the room for a left behind guest but there was noone there. Absolutely nothing out of the ordinary, except a key that magically disappeared from our office and went to lock up a door on its own from the inside.

So we tried to come up with a reasonable explanation for this. We could be pretty sure that you can not lock a door from the outside with the key in the lock on the inside. We can also rule out someone jumping through the windows to accomplish this as the room was on 3rd floor; no balconies in front of the windows. It's a good 15 metres straight down there

Having finished this

tl;dr: Door locked from the inside with noone inside the room

1345687563.0,yo8n9,My Investigation in the Pensacola Light House and Museum.,JamesLindholm,16,4,4,"Through out my life, And you shall receive) the one that sticks out the most

I had joined The United States Navy late last year. (12DEC11 is the day I left for Basic Training)  After graduation from Basic Training, We'll call him Chuck.)  He over heard me talking with a few other sailors in the barracks' smoke pit about our past paranormal experiences.  At that moment I had already pulled up information about the Pensacola Lighthouse and Museum, and was reading the contents of the article out loud.  Chuck was jealous because he has never had a paranormal experience before.  So I agreed to take him to the lighthouse that following Saturday.

Fast Forward to Saturday night.  Chuck and I were sitting outside of the Museum, like a child would watch his/her parents bring out the hidden Christmas gifts on Christmas Eve.  I found out from the Team's Equipment Technicians, that they toured with TAPS (The Atlantic Paranormal Society) on their private gigs in Florida.  So I knew we were in for an interesting night.

Upon the start of the Tour

The Basement has two spirits:  Raymond, and doesn't want to hurt anyone anymore.
     Thomas was a runaway slave.  The lighthouse was used as a stop along the Underground Train Route.  Unfortunately, and killed.  He is also a kind spirit.  He is also shy, and loves Blonde women.

The Master Bedroom on the Second Floor:  Three spirits haunt this room.  Miss Ellie, Joey.  I do not remember who passed first, but the three entities passed at two different moments in history.  Let me start with the Lady of the House.  [Victorian Era] Miss Ellie.  She fell in love with a sailor who was lost out at sea.  She was pregnant with his child, and had hemorrhaged during birth, and died shortly after.  Her daughter grew up to live a long and happy life.
    Lizzy and Joey along with their father, and the Lighthouse Keeper's Quarters in the Tower. 

About 20 high in the Tower, The Lighthouse Keeper.

At 8PM, to Yellow, to Red.)  The room had the Bed, a fireplace, a doorway leading to the Children's room, a door to the hallway (I was standing in front of the door leading the hallway, Chuck was to my right), the Lead Investigator was on the other side of the fireplace from her.  there were five other tourists to my left
     The Medium closed her eyes and said Joey was beside me, and slowly moved it around the area where she claimed the boy was.  
""There's nothing here, and I smell Lavender, a sign of Miss Ellie's presence.  All the Men in the room, including Chuck and I, were wearing hats.  I said:  ""Gentlemen, take off your hats, we are in the presence of a Lady.""  as soon as I took my cover off the EMF lit up to the red.
""She appreciates that.  Usually people come in a demand answers.""
""That is no way to treat a lady.""  As soon as I said that, and the EMF went silent. ""Miss Ellie, Will you be so kind as to take me on a small tour of your beautiful home?""  Up to the Red.  She then began to lead around the Master Bedroom and into the Children's Room.  To make it simple, Every time I asked a Yes or No question, she would light up the EMF Detector for Yes.  And if it was No, the Detector remained silent.  When she led me back into the Master Bedroom, I said: ""Thank you ma'am.  It has been a pleasure spending time with you in your beautiful home.  Thank you for having us.""  I gently ""squeezed"" her hand,( as was custom for a gentleman to do.)  and she seemed to vanish.  After that

I left the EMF Detector in the master bedroom

For the last portion of the Investigation, until someone squawked on the Walkie Talkie.  I had noticed that the Swap-Cooler that was above one of the windows, had a current flow that went straight to the bottle.  When word got out to the rest of the tourists, the room was packed, and the bottle had stopped moving. Again, I was being filmed by total strangers, arguing with the Medium/Psychic about my theory of the Bottle's movement.  I was able to prove that with the placement of the audience in the room, preventing the bottle from rocking.

But enough about my arguing with the fraudulent Psychic.  After that tour
""Given the events in the Master Bedroom with Miss Ellie
""How do you think overall of the light house?""
""I think there is some activity here but not enough for me to be satisfied enough to believe there are other entities here besides Miss Ellie.""
He looked me over for a minute and said, feel free to stop by.  We could use someone like you on our team.""

Chuck had started tugging on my sleeve as the Taxi Cab pulled up

None of this was exaggerated.  Everything I have stated here actually happened.  I'm pretty sure you might find a video of me or two with an EMF Detector arguing with the Medium.  If you do, I greatly appreciate it.  Happy Hunting!

When I was three years old, he couldn’t bare life anymore.
I know how he did it – he hung himself. Even though my mother doesn’t like talking about it, due to his weight.
Anyhow
I barely know what happened after he died

After a few years  (I was about five years old)
I woke up in the middle of the night, half sleepdrunk. Halfway the stairs I stop. Cry. And jump. Right before I fall down, I start to float. I feel my body getting lighter, and I rise up from my body. I see my body half floating, half hanging. And in a split second I wake up. Not knowing whether I dreamed It, or it just happened.

I never told anyone about this dream though, and having that dream almost daily, I started to have other dreams. 
One in a pharmacy. I could see my father carrying me through the pharmacy, but he’s sticking with me.
About two years after he died
I stood by his grave. I said hi, so you have something that reminds you of me.’ And as I lay down the drawing, his face slowly comes through the glass gravestone. (It’s hard to explain what it looks like, but the front is made of glass.. Use some imagination.) Anyhow, his face gets more visible, and I see his hands, pressing against the glass. Since it’s his spirit, and he stays low

At that point I woke up, with dreams like these. I always calmed her down by saying; ‘no worries mommy, dad isn’t angry, he is scared. Why can’t I help him? ‘
Apart from these dreams, like he was telling me stories to. I saw these stories in picture’s. If I made it up, I don’t know. For somehow, I knew things that I wasn’t supposed to know. I asked my mother for the pictures of their wedding. I asked for a particular photo, that I’d never seen before. She pulled out the scrapbook, but the photo  wasn’t there. I knew where it was. ‘mommy, you have to look in the nightstand on dad’s side of the bed, but somehow I knew where it was.
For several years, and the candle. The candle went out. I tried again. The candle burned. And the fire died. And again, and again. I knew it couldn’t be the wind, since my window was closed, and my house is isolated. It went on, and off. I could hear something, it felt like a warning. And I knew that I had to stop trying. And therefore, since it felt like my hand was getting hold by my side.

1348771749.0,10kr21,A Couple of stories,apolloRocketoflove69,14,5,0,"Hello

CHICAGO

I always believed in ghost, etc. I come from a hispanic background so its quite common in my family to hear ghost stories, share experiences. I was about 13 years old i would hear the occasional footsteps when no one was around creeking of the floor. One day i did the most idiotic i could had possibly done i invited the ghost into my house. I was alone in the living room i heard a noise and i remember saying "" Its okay you can come out I'm not afraid of you. Show yourself! (Boy was i wrong) soon after unexplainable events started to happen.

    Following that i had a sleepover with 2 of my friends i was laying down on the floor staring at the doorway of my room while my 2 friends were on the bed. We we're watching Saturday morning cartoons when i look into the doorway during a commercial and i see a black figure
  Another night i would be asleep in my room and i had a fan on my window. Late at night the fan kept making noises as if someone kept hitting it with a object. i thought it was a mechanical problem so i had gotten up to turn it off a little ball of fire circled around in the middle of the fan quickly circling around the blade and the hitting the floor i quickly turned it off. I never told my parents about it for fear of being told i was crazy
As a child i would sleep with my toys surrounding me around my bed i would always have my favorite Digimon toy on top of my television next to my bed as a sort of protection in my mind. i would always wake up it on the floor every morning. One night i fell asleep in the living room waking up to the sounds of foot steps. I then start to hear a toy of mine go off in my room. It was a 12 inch Buzz Lightyear the one in which if you touch the 3 buttons on his chest he would say 1 of his 3 catch phrases and also his laser button on his arm. As i was in the living room i can hear the toy go off in my room which was far along across the house. The laser button would keep sounding off and it would repeat his saying of ""Buzz Lightyear to the rescue."" I was in the living room close to crying because i felt helpless. i didn't go to sleep that night i stood up til 4 am hearing that laser and that phrase ""Buzz Lightyear to the rescue"" until my dad woke up to get ready for work. He then turned on the light in the kitchen and i got up and went to my room and grabbed the Buzz LightYear and it stopped going off. Ever since then it had never done that ever again. 
  The last strange event i remember was on the 4th of July. I was watching Thursday Night Smackdown with two of my friends. I remember watching a wrestling match and jumping on the couch. (The rest of my family went to my aunts house for a bbq. ) I remember jumping on the couch and then my computer screen turns on by itself and opens windows media player playing Marlyn Manson's ""Tainted Love"". I had a Compaq Presario at the time. To this day i don't know of any program on a computer that would set a timer to turn on my computer screen and start playing a song from my media player. Me and my friends freaked out and quickly ran out the house. My parents came back to the sight of their youngest soon sitting outside on the porch with his two friends scared to death.
  During these events i was told by my friend that lived in the basement of my house that they found something very strange in the laundry room. They found a picture of the former resident that lived in my basement. My cousin and her baby son also with her  underwear and paper filled with strange writings on it. I then put two and two together couple months prior to my friends moving in my cousin threw a Xmas party in the basement with a whole bunch of family and friends that would of had been the perfect window to plant such a thing. My cousins son had lost some of his skin due to burning he suffered as a baby. My cousin lost her job and nearly got deported. As a kid i remember some of my older cousins believing in witchcraft  and performing strange things with the other kids so i believe it was one of my family members that had planted the picture of my cousin

Rio Rancho New Mexico
 At the age of 15 i then moved to New Mexico with my family. I didn'oot experience anything til after a few months i started living at the new house. 
i woke up at 5:45am to take a shower so i can catch the bus at 6:30am. When i was walking towards the bathroom the bathroom light switched on and the door didn't close. I thought it was my dad perhaps using the bathroom and was too lazy to close the door so i waited next to door for him to finish. But i didn't hear anything coming from the bathroom i look in to see the bathroom being empty
I also would be awaken around in the morning to see in the corner of my eye a old man wearing a baby blue polo walking inside my yard walk past my window. I would only catch a glimpse of him and it would always be the back of his upper body and his blue polo. i always thought it was some old man that dropped something in my front yard. Our front gate would open and close at times we wouldn't think nothing of it though. Til one day i was in my sister's room using her computer with my two pet dogs when in the corner of my eye i clear as day see the old man walk past my sisters window into the yard. My dogs also seen him for they quickly began to bark and run to the front door. i also ran to the front door to see who he was for there is only one way in and one way out of my front yard. I open the front door run outside to my surprise i see no one in my yard. My dogs were more confused than me for they didn't even know what just happened.I moved out of New Mexico and back to Chicago  my sister and mom soon discovered a head stone next to our driveway after i left.
    I'm 23 years old now. I tell people these experiences I've had and i tell them all the same thing. These are things that actually happened to me i remember them so vivid.

1348000379.0,103j1q,Repost of mine from r/paranormal.  Seems more appropriate here.,patchy911,16,5,6,"We had moved into this house about 3 months before the incident. Our family consisted of myself, 2 on 1 side

It was 3:09 one night and everyone was sound asleep when I'm woken up but a little girls voice faintly saying ""Mooooom"". It wasn't a quick 'Mom' like people usually say but the way someone would say it when calling for someone in the distance or one they can't find. I roll over and look at my clock and sit up my bed wondering if I had heard what I thought I heard. Maybe it was just a dream that I was having and surely If I waited I would hear either my sister calling for my Mom or nothing and I would go back to sleep knowing it was a dream. I sat there listening for a few minutes and after hearing nothing I laid back down. Within 30 seconds of me closing my eyes I hear ""MOOOOM are you there?, made up name, just call for me. My jaw dropped! ""You heard it too?"" I asked her. Yea she called for me twice I was getting dressed to go check on her she said. I told my mom that I had just come from her room I had heard the same thing but Lucy is sound asleep! Without saying a word we both knew what we had just heard, we looked at each other and I watched her cautiously, best word I can think of, make her way back to her room looking around. I slowly made my way back to bed and didn't hear anything else.

Two months later we were driving down a back road that we had never drove on because our neighborhood had just connected to it giving it 2 entrances so we thought we see what was back that way. We turned out of our neighborhood and about a mile down the road we see a plaque, 'In 1702 a massacre of the Apalachee Indians happened on this site. Men, Women and Children were slain without remorse. We hope that they find peace in the after life that was unreachable on this planet.

My dear friend Liz, that’s when she proceeded to question me about “playing” on the Ouiga board. I told her how I’ve been raised in the roman catholic church my entire life, and playing on a ouiga board was looked down on. I had no intent on even trying it until she told me various experiences she has had on the ouiga board. I was intrigued enough to question the thought of testing the waters..

I asked her how I would go about obtaining a ouiga board, lol? What? How does a piece of paper with letters, numbers, yes, no, good &amp; evil connect me to the spiritual world? Well..it did. And I called my old friend who died of cancer, he came

Nothing strange or coincidental happened for the next few weeks. But eventually

I went out one night with some friends and the next day I woke up to a text from my roommated telling me she had taken an entire bottle of ibuprofein and said bye. I rushed home as soon as I read it

I decided to stay at my friend Nicks house, had a super wicked “glow in the dark ouiga board” that they would play with. He told me that there were points that they got a little disrespectful towards the ouiga board, such as talking about calling the devil and whatnot.

Nick and his friend Eric decided to play on the ouiga board while on 2CP (a psychadelic drug mixed with the psychoactive chemicals found in MDMA) and a weird chain of events followed..Nothing to important

Nick noted of “talking to the universe” and asking it questions.  He asked what the devils name was, but anyways back to the story..

The night I came over after the hospital, Nick told me he was getting super bad vibes. My friend Katie questioned him if it was coming from upstairs. Nick looked at her surprised and said yes.. they were both having feelings of angst coming from the same place. We put the board away and Nick had our friend Karen walk upstairs…he instructed her to turn the light on and as soon as she did so, the lights blew out.

I came over to Nicks house a few days later, the kitchen lights blew out. I didnt really think too much of it till I woke up the next  morning in complete shock.

I couldn’t open my eyes, I wouldn’t let him leave. I was so scared all day..

Nick, and she told us the best thing to do is burn sage through out the house, starting at the place where the ouiga board first introduced. She told us the proper way to burn sage to condemn unwanted spirits out. We went home, and brought out the ouigi board yet again, just to get some answers. We called any one in the room or house that we couldn’t see and proceeded to ask it questions. It seemed angry at first, so we called other people through the board. The board seemed to keep spelling “sage” and “gahan, or gaha” it was entirely strange.

Ever since then, late at night especially, like theres nothing to live for. And sometimes I feel even stronger feelings of apathy. And I feel like my will to do bad maybe increased since then. I was in the shower yesterday, when everyone in my house was asleep. Randomly the light turned off, and I figured it just blew out, but when I went to turn it back on, the switch was down, but it is making me super uncomfortable and I just want to get rid of any negative energy following me

Feedback is very much appreciated.

My second experience (and creepiest). I was in my room laying in my bed. My room shares a wall with my bathroom, its about fall time, so we had neither AC or heat on. There were no storms either. I remember i heard a tapping on my window. There is a tree that doesnt reach the window outside, but i thought an animal loosened a branch, and it hit my window. But then i hear a tap on the wall connected to the bathroom. I got a little scared, but i didnt worry too much. Until... i heard three loud poundings on my door. Its also 2:30 in the morning. So i got scared and hid under my blanket.

The next morning i ask both my mom and brother if they were up last night at that time. Neither of them were

My last and most recent story. I was with a couple friends in my basement. Me and my two friends loved ghost hunting and paranormal stuff. So my friend did a saying that he said ""opens a demonic portal"". I didnt really believe him. He closed it shortly after. And after he did. We did a recording on a cell phone (dont judge, and i only had a third friend over, but he didnt make any noise and none of us heard it before we listened to the recording.

Before I go any further, Student Transition And Readiness. As part of the STAR program you go and live on campus for the month of June before your freshman year begins. You along with 100 other freshmen live in the two traditional dorm halls, Morton and Taylor, while taking two classes. I myself stayed in Morton Hall. Traditionally Morton hall is strictly female while Taylor is strictly male. During STAR they become coed.
I had never heard of these halls before so I hadn't known of any haunting rumors. The program started off fine. We had a hall meeting on the topmost floor of the hall the first night to get acquainted with our RA and the rules of the hall. I didn't pay much attention to the RA speaking because what caught my attention was a door nearby covered with letters written to someone named Kathy. This struck me as odd because the door in question was a janitor closet. At the time I just assumed that Kathy was a janitor for the hall.
Nothing happened that first weekend. But once classes started and we formed our groups of friends things started to change. A bit of ironic humor I feel I must add for any of my friends from there
Three members of our group resided on the third floor. One of whom
Some of the rumors of her haunting include noises in the basement
My first experience happened about four nights into my stay. I had just finished writing up a speech for one of my classes and was now laying down to sleep. I drifted off to sleep with no problem but woke two hours later freezing. My blanket was under my bed and the window was open. At this point I still did not know about the Kathy haunting so I thought nothing of it. That was the only time this happened to me. As I mentioned before, signs of depression. I truly believe it was her room causing this. When we came back to NAU that August and living in a different dorm she was back to her usual bubbly self, and still is four years later. My most eye opening experiences didn't happen till my last week there. As I mentioned before Kathy likes to take blankets apparently. I didn't really believe that till I saw it happen with my own eyes. I was laying down reading the Silmarillion. Across the room my roommate was already asleep. As I am reading my book I notice a strange noise coming from his side of the room. I look over and I could clearly see his blanket being pulled off of him and under his bed. I quickly turned on the light but could see nothing there. For the rest of my stay I spent as little time as possible in that room. My only other experience came when I was sitting on the couch in the basement doing laundry. The Morton hall laundry room is probably the scariest room in the building. You walk down a thin set of concrete steps into a low ceilinged basement the size of a basketball court. There are six sets of washers and dryers in the left half of the room. And on the other side of the room a steel door is set in the wall. This leads to the set of tunnels that lead under all the buildings and walkways of NAU. Access to these tunnels is forbidden to students and non NAU personnel. The entire room is lit by only the two fluorescent bulbs over the machines. The rest of the room is in varying states of perpetual night time. I'm in here at about two in the morning doing laundry. I am in the process of emptying a washer of its contents when I hear a noise from the far side of the room. A baby rattle, followed closely by a baby laugh. The noises are coming from this metal door. Curiosity gets the better of me and I start walking over to investigate. When I am within ten feet of the door the baby laugh comes again, this time accompanied by the clear voice of a woman. ""hello"" I hear from just inside the door. My whole body freezes. For the first time in my life I felt as if my ears were betraying me. Then I heard the rattle again. I ran back to the washer, finished switching out my laundry then ran up the steps to safety. I refused to get my laundry until a friend agreed to accompany me. Later that summer in the comfort of my own home in Phoenix, I did some research on Kathy. One of the popular stories is that she was the betrothed of a WWII soldier, thus killing herself and her unborn child. This I believe,,False

A couple of weeks back I moved into a room in this old house that my aunt lives in, but a lot of the children that have been here and grew up here has always talked about people that the adults can't see. 

One example is this little girl about 2 years old

It got to one point where my aunt ( who believes in paranormal things ) got this guy that get rids of ghosts

I have no reason to think that my aunt or cousin is lying to me

Tonight I went to bed kind of early. My aunt lives over me so I can hear her when she walks around or move something upstairs. I know she went to bed early because I had dinner with her. After about an hour I started hearing footsteps. This went on and on and at first i thought it was my aunt just going to the toilet or something. But the footsteps werent like hers

I get up and I go outside and look up at the windows where she lives

I know some of you might say I shoulda called to see if my aunt was really sleeping, and she has told me that this is gonna happen from time to time :P ...

I will know for sure tomorrow when I talk to her, and I can't sleep. This is life changing for me, and so far I feel it is in a good way :)

The house was pretty unremarkable. From the street it looked like a single story but had a basement. The backyard was a decent size

The basement was unfinished other than a bathroom. My grandpa had his own sort of man cave area down there with an old TV, and various bric-a-brac on what looked like old kitchen cabinets.

The whole family and friends are all together at the reception eating

I open the door and step through while turning to close it behind me. I believe the light switch was actually located at the bottom of the stairs and naturally all the lights are off.

I take a few steps down, four feet tall, 2 feet wide, and 2 dimensional.

I stand there frozen for several seconds, find my sister, and proceed to hide under a table with a tablecloth. After calming down after a few minutes we go back to check.

Not a thing. Everything is as it should be in the basement.

Now, in Oak Harbor, Washington.

I'm stationed here in Oak Harbor, and can't wait to follow my dreams, yadda yadda yadda. So right now I'm working on the lights for a show that's off season. Spent 2 weeks getting all the timing down for the lights, and the music cues. Everything was going great.

But now I'm being haunted from start of the play to finish. The playhouse, but since my debut roll as Pete Bogg in Murder in the Magnolias, then improv work, and now lighting, I hadn't had a single encounter, and dismissed it all as rumors and people being a little too afraid of the dark.

It all started for me Yesterday when we were ready to kick off the new show that only lasted 3 days called Talking With, and then the next one goes out. Think: sooo artsy your head might explode. Trust me when I say as a 20-year-old guy, I would not go and see this play unless I was doing the lighting for it. As it turns out I was the only one who was capable, so here I am.

Anyways, or maybe the screen saver I didn't know about had kicked in. Around 3 minutes later, is when I hear a tremendous boom from upstairs. The door next to the lightbooth, where we keep all the lighting supplies, rips open with force. Then the the lightbooth door's handle turns (it has a unique old sound to it) and also gets forced open. As soon as they were opened, they both immediately slammed shut.

The photographer and myself were the only ones inside the theater at the time. Suzanne, and saying, ""There he is again! Looks like he has the opening day jitters too!"" I'm almost pissing myself at this point, but I laugh it off, and think nothing of it, only that I have to be up there for the next 3 days for 3 hours at a time (SHIT).

I got off work today (7/23/2011) at around 3pm, but it lasts for 53 hours of recording. Before the show, I took the steps that led up to the steeple and left the DVR recording in the storage room where all the ""activity"" was.

From the start of the show tonight, and the door had been opening up behind me, and quitely closing. When I got up to leave the room for intermission, I had found the dead bolt on the door had been turned to the locked position, thus locking me inside the room. Thankfully the lock was on the inside, so I flipped it and quickly got downstairs.

After the intermission was over

2 shows ago, otherwise you'll not be heard!"" They both made there exits immediately. I hate to say that I have to go back there tomorrow, but I do :(. I'll take pictures, and after the show. I will faithfully listen to the entire recording, and hopefully if I pick something up, I'll put it on here for you guys. Thanks for listening, and hopefully I survive ;)

I thought it was a little odd but changed the channel back to Cartoon Network and chalked it up to Comcast being, well, Comcast; maybe the cable box reset in the 5 minutes I was out of the room, totally possible

When I was about 15-16

The most regular/disturbing thing that happened would be this banging against the wall. My best friend had her bed against the wall and on the other side of the wall was the living room with a very large wooden bookcase against the wall. All night, there was no one there. What's more is that big bookcase was full of figurines and porcelain pieces. None of the pieces had been moved despite the fact that the amount of force we felt in the vibrations should have knocked many of the pieces onto the floor or even broken them.

On one night

Another creepy thing happened late at night when I was walking down her hallway. I saw movement out of the corner of my eye and turned to look into the kitchen. I watched as a plate (apparently by itself) slid off the counter and onto the floor without breaking. It looked like someone had picked the plate up and put it on the floor.

Another story from when I was home alone. I had a broken bong in the back of my closet for about 3 months. Forgot it was there. I went to the kitchen from my room for not even a minuite. When I return the bong which I completly forgot about was in the middle of the room. I was like wtf??? Since I was a bit more used to things happening like this now.

And I will never forget the time we were having a party at the apartment. Me and 3 of my friends we smoking a blunt in my room in a circle.

1324877490.0,nqvyb,I told my boyfriend about my some of my ghosts experiences but he didn't say anything. Advice about my experiences?,PearlnPip,5,2,9,"First off

Here’s the story:

When I was 13 or so, a black shadowy figure sprayed me with the hose. At that instant, what felt extremely cold in the dream was sending deep shivers down my spine and I remember shaking in bed. Within a week or so, I had two more dreams featuring this person and the same sensation as before. 

When I was 21, I looked around and my room looked all the same, except a dark shadowy figure was on top of me pining me to the bed. When I looked up at it, I looked for a face but I didn’t anything but darkness. I felt things radiate from it. It truly hated me and took pleasure in my panic. It radiated feelings I can’t even conjure up. A mix of what I imagine is the worst of malice, evil, spite, hatred, something in which I never want to feel again. It sickens me that I could picture it smiling at me and laughing without even as a word from its face.

Probably the most embarrassing part of the story that will turn into this being a throwaway account

It tried to rape me. By try

What may or may not be related but I often don’t tell this part. Hence

I woke up the next morning with an extreme pain in my tailbone. It felt similar to when I sprained my tailbone and I thought that somehow I injured it while I was sleeping. After a week or so
 
After that

I am 23 now. I have not seen this figure since. However a few weeks ago

tl/dr; I have had several dream like experiences that include an evil dark shadowy figure trying to frighten me with various tactics.  
 
So Reddit; any advice or comments?

I only just discovered this subreddit and I hope you can help me find some answers. 

Coming from a Greek family I was always raised with the idea of energies and spirits. But I never felt very much connected to those energies or spirits. I am a very emotional and empathetic being and so I do believe I connect to other people on a level that not everybody can

Anyway, his gift was to see the spiritual abilities in other people. He said it was very scary and it's very scary for people like him to meet someone like me. This threw me off even further as I'm a young woman in her early 20s and that guy was this experienced, hardboiled bad-ass in his 60s. Why would a guy like him be afraid of me? Unfortunately, I tend to freeze up when I'm startled, so I didn't get a chance to investigate what he meant further. And I didn't have the ovaries to approach him about it for the rest of the film shoot. 

So now I'm wondering, and I saw my brother once, when he was two years old, point up and say 'grandmother' in Greek, even though there was nothing there. She had died two months before his birth. Granted, 'grandmother' in Greek is very easy to say for a toddler and who knows what he really meant. But that image of him pointing up still lingers in the back of my mind and I keep wondering if there's more to it.

I hope someone can give me more insight on this

**TL;DR: A colleague told me he can see spiritual powers in other people and saw that I have the gift of connecting with spirits. I'm now wondering if this might be true and how I could learn more about this gift.**",self,t5_2r1q4,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/v0iww/someone_told_me_i_have_the_gift_of_communicating/

Ghost Orbs-
I took my cellphone (yes, so i know what an orb looks like. I took these three pictures that made me feel unwelcome in his house. The first picture, there was an orb, with a tail of mist falling behind it, almost looks like a zoomed in version of an artists rendition of shooting star. The second picture i took, it was headed at me, and the third picture, i got a chill on my back. A really cold chill.

EVPs-
There were two EVP recordings we got. I'll tell the less freakier one first. My friend had just gotten a real evp recorder. Knowing his house is haunted, with his door open. After recording, we listened to it and hurt a deep, low, growl that by the sound of it, sounded like it came from the other side of his basememt (the side we believe to be the most haunted part of his house). He has dogs, but small yipping dogs

The second evp scared me. I was recording a video on my cellphone in the haunted part of his house, almost like white noise, but after that i heard a ""No"". And this was a firm deep low. And it actually sounded like it might have replied from something i said earlier, which all i asked was if there were any ghosts, and if there were, they should show themselves. I also feel like ever since i was little i was being followed by a ghost, or a few of them.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/1gt7gy/i_just_posted_about_my_house_last_night_but_heres/

Not doing anything myself right now but I did have questions for other ghost searchers/hunters. 

Some people have reported ghosts effecting the electromagnetic field and have influence on electronics. Also often time people mistake electric fields for ghosts. If there is a possibility of electrical interference and correlation with equipment and ghosts, anything used, is it possible that these can cause interference and possibly prevent a ghost from being observed or cause measurements to be distorted? I imagine to prevent this would possibly having a case around said equipment to reduce the amount of electrical energy being emitted.  

Please note I have little knowledge of physics and could be sprouting complete nonsense

This is where it got wierd.

We were all 3 in plain sight of my friends parents room. We could see inside and everything. Also we could see the door to the garage. (You can pretty much see the whole house from the living room). Anyway we were just sitting talking about what we were gonna do next when we starting hearing a weird vibrating noise. It sounded like somthing rattling on somthing its hard to describe

So after sitting there trying to figure out what the hell it was we go in the room to see. It was coming from his moms side of the bed in her dresser. We open the drawer and its her vibrator, and laughing we ran out basically agreeing no one was touching that thing. So we just sit back in the living room and talk about how awkward its honna be when she hears it.

Meanwhile the thing is just rattling away. Finaly we hear his moms voice get closer to the garage door. So were all excited because its going to be funny when she hears it. The EXACT second she opens that door it stops. She gors in the fridge mixes another drink then goes back out. At that point were all like wtf. So we go in her room look in her drawer and the vibrator is SEALED back in the box and no one had been in that room.

1350078467.0,11dxn6,looking for some advice?,bearface93,2,2,7,"I'm pretty sure my house is haunted

Some background... I'm 19 now, while I was looking at it it took the form of my great grandma. It was only a silhouette but I'm positive it was her. I haven't seen it since. 

I didn't experience anything else paranormal until my freshman year of high school I believe. I have always been interested in the paranormal but hadn't experienced anything (in my house at least) since I saw my great grandma. Anyways, and one of the last times we were in that room alone she said she felt threatened, like whatever was in there didn't want her there. Even my friends who don't believe in ghosts don't like that room. Anyways, I've heard the aforementioned noises in there, I've been touched multiple times in that room and in the family room. One night I was watching tv and my grandma's (I live with my mom and grandparents) sweater was on the arm of the chair I was sitting in. I went into the kitchen to make some food and when I went back in the family room the sweater was behind the chair. One night a couple years ago I went out with some friends and got home before 2am and went right to bed. My mom told me the next day that my grandma had woken up around 4 and heard banging downstairs, like I was throwing stuff around or I had people over and we were being obnoxious. She went downstairs and all the lights were off and nothing had been moved. The stairs are next to the living room, and one night I was going to bed and after I turned off the light at the bottom of the stairs something pushed me up them. That really freaked me out.

I haven't even gotten to the upstairs yet. Recently (in the past year or so) I've been getting activity in my room. It started when I had just laid down to go to sleep and I heard a voice that kind of sounded like my dad's yell my name in my ear. I've been in the bathroom (which is next to my room) on multiple occasions and heard voices and once singing coming from my room

Another thing I've noticed is my dog. Starting my senior year of high school, I'll either hear his tags or feel him brush up against my leg. He was a little dog (a yorki-poo) and he used to curl up at my feet. I've felt that a couple times recently too. My friend from before has also seen him a couple times, once in my kitchen while we were cooking and later that night when I walked her home (she lives down the street from me) she said she saw him sitting under the tree in my front yard watching us. All of the things I've mentioned, except with my dog, have started happening during the day as well as at night within the last year or so. 
I have captured a couple EVPs too but they're really bad quality. One sounds like a stomach gurgling but if you listen really closely you can faintly hear ""help me."" Another from the same night sounds like footsteps on wood (the dining room and living room have hardwood floors). I caught those in the family room.

**TL;DR** weird shit has been happening at my house and I'm convinced it's haunted.

I want more proof that my house is haunted besides the pictures and EVPs. My friend from before and I have seen shadow people in our neighborhood so maybe they're related? She has had quite a few experiences in her own house, and my grandparents are the 2nd owners of my house. The first ones were only there for a few years. Does anybody have any ideas as to how I can get more evidence of a haunting in my house? I would really appreciate it. Sorry about the length of this by the way.

There are two different stories as to how the The Woman of the Nipomo Mesa came to be.  Here's the first:

Many years ago, a young woman was walking along the mesa to a meeting place to elope with a young man.  They place they decided to meet up at was by an old rope bridge.  When she got there, she was greeted by a group of men who tried to rape her.  She broke free from their grasp, and tried to run across the bridge, by fell over when a board had snapped and She fell into the slew (Parts of the Mesa were bogs).  She broke her neck and drowned. 

The Bridge had actually existed until a few years before I was born (1988).  The county tore it down to build  homes and roads in the area.  My dad use to walk that bridge everyday when he was a child living on the Mesa

The other story of how she came to be, there was indeed a train that had tipped over at the slew, and a few had died.  (I don't know where I could get copies of the county records from my current location in Norfolk, VA to use as verification).

Now on to the Experiences.  I'll start with my Grandfather (My Mom's Dad).

There is a road called Umbrella Road, and costed lifeless until it got to the bottom of the dip.  Knowing the stories, and being a skeptic, he hopped out of the truck and started to inspect the engine, when he heard a woman's voice.  I don't remember what he had heard the voice say, but it scared him enough to get back into his truck.  ""The damned thing wouldn't start!""  I remember him telling me when I was a child. ""I heard a tapping sound coming from my window, so I turned and looked, ""The engine started itself up.  And without hesitation

Here's one from my Grandmother (My Dad's Mom)

At one point in time my grandmother had lived on Umbrella Road, as the fog lifted.

That's all I have for now.  I know I'm forgetting a story.  When I remember it

First my bedroom's fan turned on by itself. I wasn't there for it but my mom swears she turned both my light and my fan off and when she went back in my room

After that I experienced a light in the living room turning on in the middle of the night. I figured my dad just left it on so I turned it off; however my dad told me the light was back on when he got up in the morning for work (this was about a week ago). The light turned on again last night. I couldn't sleep and when I got up at 3 to go to the bathroom it wasn't on but at 5 o'clock it was. The light isn't a dimmer but we have it on a remote control with two other lights--none of the others turn on. We do have a cat but I find it hard to believe he jumps up on the table

So besides all that my mom also said she heard footsteps coming from our dining room but that it may be ""the floor settling.""

They were drunk and forced me to let them use my Ouija board. I always thought they were interesting. I had only used it twice with my Aunt, back to the story.
I tried to stop them but they insisted and wouldn't let down until I gave it to them. Which was stupid of me. I didn't go into the house with them the second time they went in, they were too drunk and stupid to listen to my advice. After that I went outside and waited. They were in there for half an hour before I heard a scream. I ran inside. What I saw next horrified me. I have nightmares about it still. Sarah had deep gashes up her legs, arms and her hands and feet were covered in blood. Her body was pale and still and when I looked at her face, she was expressionless. Her eyes a different colour, her lips so very, very light pink. I soon figured out that they had used a cup instead of the eye. I saw the cup between Sarah's legs. It was broken up into four large slivers. Three between her legs, and one still in one of the gashes on her legs. The glass was covered in thick, I'm guessing that it was a poltergeist, Chloe and I dragged Sarah to my aunts house where she stitched her up whilst I told her what happened. Jack told us what happened while I wasn't in the house and my aunt went paler than Sarah had done. Sarah doesn't remember any of it, but she didn't believe it. My aunt told me to let it go
She used to go to parties every Friday night, and I got the same feeling as I did when I walked into the abandoned house. The cobwebs, the freezing cold wind only this time, I felt something brush past me and stop right in front of my face. I heard breathing, and I felt sick. Sarah didn't notice me walk in, only It did. I backed out slowly and closed the door. I told her mother she was asleep and that I didn't want to disturb her. I went home and burst out in tears. Had I lost one of my best friends? Was I able to ever see her again without It near her? Would It hurt her mother? Her sister or brother? I haven't seen her since.

Now it was the summer i turned six years old. I moved to my grandma's house. I now live there again due to money problems. (it's getting better for us). I have always felt something there with me while staying there. I was walking down the through the game room. We had a Fooseball table and the bar spun out of control. My uncle lived with us. He always messed with us and i thought he was being a jerk or something. I checked around he was not there. I nearly shit my pants. I backed away slowly and them took off. I told my parents but they didn't believe me. I don't think they believe me now because of all the other experiences i have now. A few months of living there. My dad went to las vegas. We lived in the upstairs room. My brother and i shared a bed and mom was alone in the other. We then woke up to screaming. We turned on the lamp and my mom was crying. She told us to fall asleep. She didn't tell me what had happened that night til now. I asked her and she said she was dreaming of a women walking through the hall of our house. She walked in the room and and sat down on her side of the bed. She woke up for a brief moment and saw a spot on the bed with an indention. It was as if someone was sitting there. She believes that. But doesn't think i am telling the truth. The rest of the time we lived there was just some voices, rainy, day. My brother and parents were gone. I was home alone. I keep my gun on me at all times when home alone. It's an airsoft gun with the orange tip broken off. It looks real. It's really shiny so it looks real. I almost forgot about the events of the other two experiences before. This spawned the memory. I was about 13 at the time. I was sitting on the couch watching a movie. I suddenly hear rustling and footsteps upstairs. I know it wasn't my dogs because both were next to me wimpering. I got up with as much courage as i had. Grabbed the biggest kitchen knife. Put it in my belt line. I slowly walked up stairs. I started yelling random insults. I saw that there were foot prints in the carpet. Those were the only experiences. 
We were in financial trouble going into my freshmen year of highschool. So we move back to my grandmas house. We slept in my uncle's old room. We would wake up with the lights on, crack heads, and shootings all the time. But he said that that really scared him. When i sleep at night. I see shadows that crawl on the ceiling. Black figures stand next to me while i sleep. I can't move when they are there. I came home one day to find no one home. A note on the table said my parents were at fiesta. ( I live in san antonio. It's a celebration downtown). So the night slowly falls and my fight begins. My brother is at his friends house. I hear voices in the dining room. I am in the kitchen and grab a knife. I run in there ready to kill. But nothing. Nothing but a chair pulled to the middle of the room. I pushed it in and left. I am not scared. I am angry about these things. So i provoke this thing. I run through the house and start yelling at it. I don't think in yelled ""fuck you"" more in my life. I run upstairs to see my room light is turned on and the tv, xbox, lamp, bass amp, and playstation 2 is on. I yelled leave at the top of my lungs. And the suddenly. The feeling of eyes left my spine. The sensation was gone.... For a while. It was about 3 weeks later. I am asleep in the morning and feel tugging on my blankets. I feel it but don't acknowledge it. I plan on waking up swinging my fist at it. But i can't. I am frozen. My eyes won't open. I see myself in my head. There is a big hideous monster next to me. It had my face but it was completely deformed and bloody. Big teeth and drool. That was the only time i felt an evil presence. This was about 3 in the morning. I didn't sleep the rest of the night. I just left my lamp on and played pokemon. I haven't felt anything major lately. My fence opens by itself. The hinges are rusted so it's hard to open. Wind is not able open it. My brother and i just got done playing baseball and the fence swung open fast.

I get use to this stuff and have to pretend it's not real. I don't wanna make my little brother worry. I just try and comfort him. Choose to believe this or not. It's very real. ",self,t5_2r1q4,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/tjxx8/ghosts_are_everywhere_i_move_too_sucks/

Anyways, I feel quite uneasy. At first I thought it was just the fact that this was the room of my now dead grandmother, but lately that has nothing to do with it at all. After about 5/6 months I started to feel as if someone/something was in the room with me when I was trying to sleep, just watching me. Of course this terrified me so I began to sleep facing the wall, away from the area that I felt this presence. I also began sleeping with my headphones in my ear, to block out any noises this thing/person might make. Anyways, this obviously made me uneasy and very scared. I told my boyfriend who understands but isn't to much help.

So anyways, I couldn't hear a thing. (The song I was listening to was very soft, and my ipod was on repeat.) After about 10/15 minutes, I heard a male voice yell, and I literally mean yell, at me to ""STOP IT"". Nobody else was awake at this hour, and it sounded as if it was right into my ear. Right after this, I was terrified.

When she came back she flicked on her light to see that all of her stuffed animals that were on top of her headboard, were now sitting neatly and in order on the ground. And I do not necessarily believe that this is relevant, but when I was younger (~8) I had a dream that terrified me even to this day. In the dream my grandmother asked me to run downstairs to grab a carton of milk from the fridge, so I did. I came back upstairs with it but I had accidentally grabbed the wrong one, so she sent me back. For some reason when I got to the bottom of the stairs, which back then was used for weights).

1329193901.0,pomo4,The Maxwell House,janepaul,1,1,0,"I have always experienced “supernatural” things and have encountered many different spirits throughout my life. I wanted to share a somewhat recent story from a house I lived in that was built in 1901. 

My parents bought the “Maxwell” house several years ago and it has since been remodeled and restored. I helped with most of the construction and found news papers from the early 20th century, but it has always given me an uncomfortable feeling - like something bad happened there. After moving back to Spokane, WA from London, England, I rented the house from my parents for the last year 2011. My husband lived with me (obviously) and  he also experienced a handful of things, including an unnatural fear of my walk-in closet. This specific story happened around August 2011 when my husband and I had a friend living with us for a couple months.

And now for the classic visual house layout. My husband and I lived in the upstairs of our 2 story 4 bedroom house (including a basement). The upstairs consisted of my office directly to the left of the top of the stairs, and our bedroom on the right side of the hallway directly across the library. Our friend’s room was downstairs directly under the library which is the reason the library is the library due to being able to hear EVERYTHING happening upstairs when in our friend’s bedroom. Now let me begin....

It was a long day and I said goodnight to my friend and headed upstairs to sleep. When I was transitioning into dream mode, but I just ignored it and checked my text message since I was now wide awake. 

“What are you doing up there? Are you moving boxes?” was what I read from my friend downstairs. I was instantly spooked and called her to clarify. Unfortunately she told me that she heard distinct walking and what sounded like boxes moving

There was nothing that could have made the noises my friend heard. I don’t have any animals and we were the only ones in the house at the time. My friend and I went over what happened and tried to come up with an explanation - but all efforts were futile. Before my dad and I added the walk-in closet into the library - the closet was just empty open attic-like space. We found some spice tins and toys in there - but nothing especially odd.

I was 20. We were in Venice in the winter (not recommended). If you've been to Venice you'll have seen how labyrinthine it is. Now imagine that out of season with NO people around, it wasn't clear how long it was going to take to get out of there.

Suddenly we rounded a corner

Beneath the streetlamp was a young teenage girl, and was able to understand enough Italian to get directions out of the maze and back to the train station area. She was a really sweet, helpful young girl. We thanked her and soon found our way out.

It wasn't until a little later on that it hit us how odd the meeting was. How out of place she was. To us it looked like she could have been the only person in a 500m radius or more. Waiting for something under a streetlamp. There was nothing to wait for. It just didn't really add up and still doesn't. At the very least she seemed very vulnerable

I believe that I have been targeted by at least one sex demon. Over the past year I have felt as if I have been watched outside my house while on my late night smoke breaks and the feeling is the worse after midnight. I have been hearing shit walk near me, which I know is a sign of psychic vampirism. Over the past few months I have started to hear several voices calling my name over and over again. Last night I was physically contacted. I was smoking a cigarette around 1am when I started hearing the voices again and could hear and feel things walking around me. This time they were far more distinct and then I actually heard something tell me  ""[They] were sex demons and would give me a wild ride"".  I convinced myself I was just hearing shit, as it was quite windy, but within a minute I felt as if a presence had entered my body and something was pleasuring me from the inside. All my motor functions seem to cease and this continued. Suddenly I snapped out of my ""revery"" and felt completely normal but then realized that at least 30 minutes had passed, and I could no longer feel any presence near me.
I have never felt their presence inside my house before
The entities don't seem to wish me any harm
