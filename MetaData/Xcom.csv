1351078036.0,12015s,Dear Firaxis: WTF Were you thinking when you planned the first DLC?,Ganrao,561,135,384,"I'll keep my list of complaints short and hope one of you sees this.

* A) What people are asking for: randomly raiding alien bases on Earth again, in short more map variety. Nobody who plays X-Com asked for more story missions, but those are the only type you're adding in the first DLC. Weee. For those who don't get why Story Missions are bad: a lot of people are already complaining about seeing the same maps over and over again. This DLC adds 3 maps that you always play in the same order and are rewarded final tier research and a ""hero"" character for playing. There you go, the carrot is in place, now go play the same 3 maps every time you play XCOM from now on. This is the exact opposite of providing more map variety.

* B) Adding a ""Hero"" NPC is another feature nobody has ever asked for, therefore you would be silly not to use him.

* C) How is giving early access to the most powerful weapon in the game good for maintaining your ""carefully balanced research system"" ? This goes against your own logic of why you couldn't alter the tech tree by adding new things to it. How about making building labs worthwhile instead?

**This DLC seems like it was designed by someone who has never played XCOM: EU for people who have never played XCOM: EU. Sleeping Dogs: Turn Based Edition Alien Rampage.**

1349859621.0,118soq,10 Tips and Tricks (Minimal Spoilers) ,RustedCorpse,251,26,293,"   I'm on my seventh play through on Classic Ironman and I THINK this one is going to be a win.  The game is epic and I don't feel disappointed at all with the learning curve present

1) Live Aliens are your friend.  They can snowball EVERYTHING  else in the game (See money spoiler).  They give you weapons intact

2) Engineers beat Scientists in this game. Engineers run your satellites and make them cheaper

3) Money Cuts the Rope. There isn't a Laser Cannon racket you can run here. You will be pressed for money at least till mid game.  At that point

4)The game will tell you what sell on the grey market.  The game will clearly state what is harmless to sell.  That said [Don't sell Alloys

5) When selecting missions: 5th Red Bar &gt; Engineers &gt; Scientists &gt; Recruit (Capt. or Higher imo) &gt; Money &gt; Recruit

6) I'm actually not using a foundry this game.  The refunding and Shiv's are nice, but I see some serious potential with the pistol line of research though. 

7) As far as tactics, but I haven't seen it.  At higher levels supports are also a force.  I really don't find my heavies doing that much, and my sniper is mostly just overwatch. I tend to recruit Zerg the UFO and Terror Missions. Abuduction missions I use to level up my better troops as they're fairly linear. Any escort or VIP mission will be a gear check.  Seriously they are beast.  The easiest might be the bomb ones and that's only because you eventually hard counter poison. 

8) Just to note, usually your highest ranking or most mission dude.

9) F1 while your soldier is selected will tell you your current bonuses or penalties in combat.  You can quick view this with a small ^ next to your soldier on screen.  Green=Good

10) Last, you don't lose the research if you rebuild it, but if it's gone you're back to squad size 4 and other problems.

I will add any pointers that people think are valid

1350150307.0,11f77q,XCOM Rookie Advice,parkfyre,224,22,242,"It's obvious that many people in this thread are veterans of XCOM.  I figured I'd start a small thread with advice for newer rookies to XCOM to help you survive the invasion.  I'd appreciate if other veterans would lend their experience as well!

1.) Understand the roles of your soldiers and their abilities -
Smoke grenades are absolutely amazing for providing cover when the environment doesn't.  Run and Gun is great for taking out aliens in bad positions or to get to something that absolutely has to die.  A well placed rocket or two can take out grouped up aliens with ease.  The point is you need to think beyond the soldier themselves and utilize their strenghts.

2.) Cover.  Few things are as important to your soldiers well being as cover.  As you approach an area you'll see a shield.  If the shield is filled in fully it provides good cover.  If it is half full then it is partial cover.  You can still maintain a line of site to your enemies.  There are VERY few situations where you want your soldiers to not be behind cover of some sort.  Understand too that your cover can be destroyed and the enemy WILL exploit this.  Always have your next move planned.

3.) Positioning.  This ties in with the first two things.  You will want your sniper in areas with great vision over the field.  They have a long range and you can trait away the overwatch penalty.  I like to keep my support at mid range to access any soldier quickly with a med kit

4.) Flanking is a matter of when

5.) Overwatch.  Everyone should know this but you can end your turn in the blue radius and still activate overwatch.  This enables you to take a shot at enemies who move in to your line of site when its the aliens turn to move.  This is ESSENTIAL.  I find much more success by moving slow and allowing all soldiers to be on overwatch than by sprinting ahead and being caught with your pants down in close proximity to newly discovered aliens.

6.) PATIENCE.  Nothing kills you faster in this game than by rushing without a plan.  From the first steps off of the sky ranger your priorities should be to get cover, etc), then advance orderly covering each others movements.  The guy who sprints blindly into yellow will be the first to get killed.

7.) When possible, taking a few extra turns to set up a capture might be better than the quick kill.

8.) Keep a little cash and supply on hand unless you are in dire straights.  Being able to take advantage of an opportunity to craft 3 weapons for a huge profit are great ways to get a boost.  If you run yourself dry

9.) YOU WILL NOT KEEP UP WITH DEMAND - This is important.  Squaddies are going to die from time to time.  Panic will spread.  Your enemy has better technology

The first thing to know about playing through the game on Ironman Impossible difficulty is to forget everything you think you know about X-COM. I've gone on record in the past as having said that X-COM has always been a game about ""mitigating damage"" and ""loss prevention"".  The fact of the matter is that when you play the game on this setting that a lot of people are going to die no matter what you do

While it IS possible to lose the game in a tactical setting

So let's talk about the strategic aspect of the game first.

For starters

During the early portions of the game

When you launch a satellite it will lower the panic of the country you launch it in. This works to your benefit. You need to intentionally ignore the countries that you WANT to launch satellites in right off the bat.  I intentionally ignore all of Africa during the first 1-2 months of gameplay so that those countries go into panic and I can launch enough satellites in Africa to get the “All In” bonus and increase my monthly income by 30%. 

ALWAYS

Reserve your Alien Base Assault until you absolutely NEED to do it in order to either progress the storyline or

Research is an interesting thing when it comes to Impossible difficulty. Remember that I said that time is your most valuable asset... but you have neither enough time nor enough resources to research all the things that you want to have.  This is a nice time to start transitioning this discussion toward the tactical setting.

Snipers are fantastic in XCOM Enemy Unknown. Guess what? You don't need them on Impossible difficulty.  The aliens will always outnumber you

I only use snipers during the beginning portions of the game kind of like throw-away red shirt away team peons. By the time you can start researching Precision Lasers you can safely dismiss all of your Snipers. 

Why? Because Impossible difficulty's tactical setting needs to be ATTACKED AGGRESSIVELY, and 1 Support. You need to be able to put enough shots into the aliens before they put enough shots into you. Assume that every Muton you see wants to land a grenade right on your entire squad. DON'T LET THEM. Assault and Heavy classes get the ability to attack twice per turn at a very low rank versus Snipers who get Double Tap at the Colonel rank. They won't live long enough to make it to Colonel rank, bottom line.

The added benefit to ignoring the Sniper class means that you can leave out Precision Laser research, and even Archangel Armor research. Not only does this free up a lot of resources used in the research process, but you don't have to construct any of these weapons which leaves you more resources to build things like Firestorms and Plasma cannons.

On every mission with the exception of the final mission I took two officers (Lieutenant, two enlisted (Sergeant, Corporal), and two newbies (Squadie, Rookie). People are gonna die, and you can't afford to put all your eggs in one basket. Eventually certain soldiers will distinguish themselves and your Captains may become Majors and those Majors may be fortunate enough to become Colonels. 

Save your Colonels to take ALL of them on the final mission. As soon as the Gollup Chamber becomes available you want to have one of those Colonels fitted with a Psi Armor and ready to go – Whichever 'gifted' Colonel you send to use the Gollup Chamber is automatically granted all available ranks of Psionic skill

The most important thing is to stick to the 2 officer

Every Assault soldier needs to have their double shot ability and every Heavy should take Heat Ammo. I know you'll miss out on some nice perks by taking these but once you start running in to Cyberdiscs, and Ethereals you'll understand why you need an overwhelming show of force. 

Heavy plasma with heat ammo reigns supreme during the final missions of XCOM on Impossible difficulty. 

Final mission spoiler: [And having three Assault soldiers Run &amp; Gun into the room with the final Ethereal Commander and blow him to pieces with their double shot abilities before anyone even has a chance to react to it is absolutely priceless.](/spoiler)

I'm going to cover a bunch of stuff in this post

**What is Overwatch?**

Just so we're on the same page, and the Overwatcher must have line-of-sight on the victim. Overwatch shots do not trigger on any action except for movement. Choosing to Overwatch ends your soldier's turn entirely, regardless of how many actions they had left. I'll interchangeably refer to Overwatch shots as reaction fire.

**I know that and I use it all the time

The using it all the time is the problem. Its a common refrain in this thread that should always end your turn on Overwatch and that's a false statement that will result in the death of a lot of soldiers. This is because of something incredibly

*An alien that knows it is being Overwatched will not move for any reason* (Short of panic). This is for the same reason that you try to avoid moving when you're being Overwatched: the AI doesn't want to give you the free shot and potential kill. However, if the AI knows a unit is being Overwatched, it will not move that unit under any circumstance. Instead, it will fire at one of your units. On unmodded Classic, this is super-bad because the aliens receive bonuses to their Aim and Crit chance, meaning their chances of hitting and killing one of your soldiers is significantly higher.

This is why you are fucking up using Overwatch. By always choosing to Overwatch if you can't think of anything else

**So Overwatch is useless then.**

No

1)The AI in XCOM is not omnipotent. If it doesn't have line-of-sight on you, when you are in the initial scouting phase, you should be ending every turn on Overwatch in case an alien pack runs into view. This is also useful for Overwatch traps, where you pull your soldiers back, Overwatch them, then let Muton Berserkers charge in and get fucked up by a criss-crossing plasma disco.

2) The refusal of the AI to move while it is Overwatched is as much as a risk to them as it is a risk to you. This means they won't shift out of half-cover, so make sure that the potential gain of pinning it is higher than the potential risk of injury or death. Its honestly better to use Suppression for this particular use.

**I'm a goon

- Overwatch when you are scouting and not certain what you'll run into.
- Overwatch when you want to keep an alien pinned down to flank it/shoot it/whatever.
- Overwatch when you know the AI doesn't have LOS on you and thus doesn't know what you're doing.
- DO NOT Overwatch if you will gain nothing from this alien's current position. Either take the shot if its &gt;40% or Hunker Down.
- AVOID Overwatching while in half-cover. Half-cover is not hugely useful on Classic and it is almost always better to Hunker Down than doing anything else.

People who say you should always end by Overwatching are straight-up wrong. I followed that particular advice and was losing 1+ soldiers every mission. When I learned how the AI responded to Overwatch and began thinking about my use of it in that context,,False,self,t5_2si6x,False,,True

Just to add to the now-growing list of tips and tricks for those playing the game now, and a couple of stuff I discovered about the endgame that I really wished I knew.

* The obvious part about focusing on satelites and workshops in the early game? Its vital in Classic, and be as fast as possible. Time is very much a short resouce in an Impossible game.

* Get a Foundry up (Experimental Warfare research) as soon as you can. You want this up as soon as you start seeing Thin Men. Research autopsies on these and quickly Foundry up Improved Medkits. Your men will thank you

* Only one Laboratory. Seriously. Focus on Workshops instead. Get two if you simply cant wait on research

* If you can skip Beam Weapons and go straight to Plasma

* Skeleton Suit is a nice upgrade to Carapace, since they shoot just as well as the snipers.

* Dont bring a whole team of Colonels to a small scout UFO crash. If ever, right? *RIGHT*?) dont panic and shoot themselves in the foot. Colonels are for big missions, like the alien base, or a crashed battleship...

* Titan Armor is great and all, can grapple, and can stealth 4x. Can you imagine the level of butthurt you can pull with a fully-steathed team not triggering an alien spawn, then have someone drop stealth with the rest of the team in overwatch, have multiple reaction shots (with the stealth drop +crit), and if you set it up right, use the Assault's Close Combat Specialist perk.

* **Assault:** Ghost armor these guys, and sneak these guys into an alien spawn that hasnt ""activated"". Drop steath. Watch the minor action cutscene of them noticing your guy, and watch them start to move. Oh, wait, they're dead now, cause your Assault just reaction-shot all of them in the FACE with a shotgun. This is called the Assault Bomb for a reason ;)

* **Heavy:** Extra grenades may prove more useful than you think, go for the extra grenades.

* **Heavy/SHIV:** You do know you can offload Suppression duties to a SHIV

* **Heavy:** You know that Shredder Missile ability? It doesnt use your normal rocket shot. Its essentially an extra rocket that does less damage, which leads to...

* **Sniper:** In The Zone makes it so kills on targets *not in cover* or *are flanked* are FREE moves. Heavy Shreds a group of 3-4, right? *RIGHT*?) nails them all in a single turn. Awesome synergy. (Sidenote: you only get 1 shot on a pistol but In The Zone works as intended if you can shoot your sniper rifle).

* **Sniper:** Disabling Shot may prove to be VITAL not only in capture scenarios, nullifying its sight.

* **Heavy:** Extra rockets is always awesome (Rocketeer)

* **Support:** Even if you are not intending for a specific Support to be the assigned Medic

* **Support:** Revive is awesome and all, you already screwed up somewhere massively.

* **Support:** You know Combat Drugs in the wonderful magic smoke they can eventually pop down? Thats a + to Crit and Will. + to Will. That means less likely to be mind-controlled right there. Let your guys get high on success (or just get high on magic smoke

* You know that bit after finishing off the Alien Base? Dont research it until you get some better interceptors out on the field. Trust me on this.

* Psionics. This is another reason why you save your Colonels. They already have high Will from leveling up (Will being the basis of Psionics). Send 3 of them into the lab (WITHOUT THEIR GEAR, thats just counterproductive. Granted Psi-capable troops are rare to begin with, but activating psi on a Colonel means that its a tough soldier to start off with, capable of handling itself as it levels up its psi capabilities.

I hope someone is writing all of these down so that we can have a repository of tips/tricks for newcomers to X-Com to read :D

~~~

EDIT: Additionals follow here

* /u/creepy_doll and /u/MisuVir note that you can still grab the Psi tested soldier's gear via the Barracks.
* /u/creepy_doll notes that its better to cap not for captives
* /u/MouthSouth notes that you can have a Squad-Sight-based sniper overwatch with the sniper rifle after a move. Simply overwatch with the pistol, Sniper will be overwatching with the rifle.

1. Camera. Oh my god how I hate camera in this game. The person responsible for camera should be tortured the same way he tortures us with this piece of sh... On a multilevel UFO I want to swear loudly



2. I think the main drawback in terms of gameplay in this game is the lack of friendly fire (except for AoE damage). No more accidentally killed soldiers and aliens (my favourite). Also it's a pain to capture a controlled alien now. You have to move him somewhere safe



3. The process of assigning soldier's equipment gets second prize in ""the most horrible usability"". Why would the soldiers keep their items on themselves when they are in barracks? Are they really walking the base in that Titan Armour with a heavy plasma on their shoulders? At least they remove the items from wounded soldiers



4. Why can't I shoot in a random direction? That is ridiculous! I don't want to go over the corner of a building because there is an alien standing there. I want to shoot the wall and walk inside from completely unexpected direction. Such a limitation in terms of tactics.

I just want to share a story. Tonight

I'm playing Normal Ironman

Oh no. All of my good squad was injured from the last mission except for a new Heavy. I had her and a team of four rookies. As I geared up the squad

Two squad members had med packs, so I was moving inches at a time until I found a single sectoid. I quickly dispatched him with the Heavy. ""This isn't so bad"", I thought to myself foolishly.

 And then all hell broke loose the next turn. All. Fucking. Hell.

Four more sectoid come into range. Then three floaters. Then two thin men on the roof of a building. It seemed like a never ending flow of assholes was pouring from the sky. At this point

I lost two rookies in one turn. They were fairly close to each other and were flanked by four sectoids. It was at this point that I realized I might have to abort. But I didn't.

My Heavy took out a floater. Two rookies dispatched the other two floaters and a thin man. Then the sectoids began to fall under LMG fire. And then, tried to shoot at an alien, and was slaughtered. It was just my Heavy with her SCOPE, and Andrea the Rookie with a single medkit. They were spread out on either side of the entrance. I told myself I'd be fine. And then, just as I moved my Heavy to avoid being flanked by a sectoid, I remembered the thin men on the roof.

My Heavy fell. She fell hard. And then the fire focused on Andrea

I didn't have visuals anymore

A sectoid came up on her from around the other side of the building

That sectoid ate lead like a bitch. The second he moved

Three turns she was fired at by the thin man. Three turns his shots missed. And then he was dead. The RNG gods must have felt bad

I wasn't sure how many were left

And what did Andrea the Panicked Rookie with 1 HP do? She stepped out of her cover and blew that fucking sectoid straight to hell.

And then the mission ended.

There are some completely ridiculous complaints about the new X-Com as opposed to the old that I've seen a few times

&gt; 1) Weapon choices are too linear and limited

This could be true (compared to other games that aren't the original X-Com), and there were not even Shotgun / Sniper / LMG / Rifle variants at each tech level. Not only that, the Heavy Laser in old X-Com was widely panned as being completely terrible, so early-mid game you would literally use nothing but Laser Rifles. For Plasma, Heavy was slightly less accurate, but you could snipe with 100% accuracy from across the map with it anyway if your agent had developed his aim well enough. Basically the only reason you would keep P. Rifles around were for your guys with shitty aim stat, it was a sub-optimal weapon. As well, they were all basically terrible and made obsolete by Laser Rifles. The new class-based weapon system is far superior

&gt; 2) The TU system was better

This is utter bullshit. The current system SEEMS very limiting at first, Medics get to run extra far compared to other classes, etc...

The new time system is elegant, it allows for all 4 of the classes to feel very different. You can't consider the time system in a vacuum, calling it worse than TUs without considering how it ties in with your agent's classes and how their interaction forces you to use all your agents differently. This is a HUGE improvement over the old X-Com where everyone was essentially the same once you had flying armor + heavy plasma on your entire team.

&gt; 3) I can't free aim with all my weapons

Yes, and frankly once your accuracy was high enough you could go Automatic and destroy the cover + get the kill with 1 guy anyway just by shooting directly at the alien. It just wouldn't work in this game, the skills and abilities are not tuned for that possibility, and if the aliens could do it on purpose too (and why wouldn't they, if you could?) you would be completely fucked since they all have Plasma all game long. As well, the designers DID allow you to do this, almost certainly intentionally

&gt; 4) Interceptor combat sucks now

Ship combat was never very interesting, but it was never really better than it is now. As well, in the old X-com you were able to completely obliterate ships in the air accidentally (not just down them), and you would hardly ever WANT to do that because you would then forfeit all the materials you could have nabbed by going to the crash site. Again it was a micro-intensive detail that was more annoying to deal with than anything. Same with being able to down ships over water and not being able to recover them, more annoying than a ""feature"".

**Now then

* Unlimited Ammo + Pistols

Not having to micro-manage ammo clips is so freaking awesome. Everyone carrying a side-arm that never needs reloaded is also awesome. Snipers being able to pull one out, also awesome. In case you don't remember, in the original X-Com you not only had to buy / find / make / research clips, you had to manually put them on your Skyranger, then manually equip them to all 12 of your agents before every mission. It was a chore, and added nothing to the fun of the game. I'm glad modern XCOM agents are finally smart enough to realize they need to bring enough ammo along with their guns without the Commander personally making sure they didn't forget it along with their lunchbox and homework.

* Agents / Classes

Yeah I mentioned this already, at least their stats aren't random. That is a huge Agent improvement over the original, where you could spend money and time hiring new rookies only to find out they were utterly shit and would serve as nothing better than plasma-fodder when you needed a UFO door opened. Now that you only get 6 agents, you can't afford to bring along red shirts, so that means there is literally no use for agents with sub-optimal stats. Speaking of only 6 agents, great decision! Sometimes I find even with just 6 that having to cycle all of them into Overwatch multiple turns in a row gets tedious, but at least it isn't 12. A more focused tactical experience where your agents ALL matter, is much more intense. Agent skills while ranking up are GREAT and really make them feel MUCH more powerful as they gain experience.

* The new Time System

I've already explained why I like the new time system if you read the above stuff. I'll summarize here: It is elegant

* The new Weapons / Armor / Tech Progression

Huge fan of the new class specific weapons, Shotguns suck at long range, but they do incredible damage with perfect accuracy up close. They complement your Close Combat Specialist and Run &amp; Gun skills perfectly. Same with other classes and their skills, like say a Sniper who took Squadsite and Gunslinger. They can compensate for their lowered damage on the move and close range inaccuracy somewhat by having a powerful Pistol equipped, especially if you do the Foundry pistol upgrades and use a SCOPE.

**Things I Do Not Like:**

* I do not like that you can only send out 1 team at a time and there is only ever 1 event going on at a time. 

I don't care for the Abduction missions, in the original X-Com the aliens had their own agenda and you were reacting to it as much as you were trying to contain it. That feeling of fighting an implacable foe that begins to strike more and more frequently with stronger forces, all over the world, is gone. I don't like that enemy base raids are gone, they were a staple of the late game and particularly harrowing due to their 2-stage nature. Having mentioned double-stages, I miss them. I don't mind how small some of these maps are, it focuses the action and forces you to use different tactics than you would on a larger map

* I do not like that the X-Box controller does not allow you to issue weapon swap / open door / de-activate bomb commands after dashing / shooting / Overwatching.

The Mouse + Keyboard does, they should patch it out of Mouse + Keyboard so that there is no in-game advantage to using one control scheme over the other. It would hurt, sure, but as it is there is an obvious advantage PC players have over console players imo.

* I do not like having to watch the ""We see you!"" animation every time an alien group spots you.

Seriously

* I do think Classic mode has one major balance issue

Panic increases far too quickly. You can win every mission and still lose countries by the end of the 2nd month

* I do not like how easily your soldiers can panic

They should have been given (temporary) bonus Will for each alien killed instead of just losing Will when they get spit on by a Thin Man and losing their shit. If the mission begins with your team leader getting his head blown off before you kill any aliens,False,self,t5_2si6x,1350380981.0,,,t3_11j97h

1370740516.0,1fygwp,Just Completed Ironman Impossible. Here's a few things I learned that I haven't read elsewhere.,Sauronski,115,16,59,"I just completed Ironman Impossible after a LOT of trial

An [imgur album of two particular missions of note and my game winning stats](http://imgur.com/a/KlrUa#0) can be viewed at the above link.

Second Wave Options used:

* New Economy (Random council funding per country)  
* Not Created Equally (Random rookies starting stats)  
* Hidden Potential (Random stat gains on rank up)  
* Absolutely Critical (+60% chance to crit against flanked targets - No
* High Stakes (Mission rewards randomised)

There were a LOT of things that just ""went right"" in this playthrough

**Preface**: I generally start Africa for +30% income. This is fundamental to my playstyle of Satellite and Uplink rushing.

**First**: Do not build your first satellite before your first panic mission. Everyone I've seen will build an immediate $100 satellite at the start of the game and not use it. If you wait until after your first terror mission and take Engineer rewards

**Second**: You do not need alien containment to capture Outsiders and they are the single easiest thing to capture in the game - Their first turn is spent rushing to your team to attempt a flank making them easy

**Third**: Abuse panic to capture and specially train your troops. An enemy that is under overwatch by any troop and flanked by any troop will USUALLY panic. This allows you to dominate the battlefield. In some missions I'd have 3 or 4 active groups of sectoids. Eventually I'd flank EVERYONE

**Fourth**: Learn scenarios in which enemies will break panic and act. Thin Men tend to spit poison if there's anyone not immune in LoS and Mutons + co. will throw grenades if anyone in range is behind destructible cover or they can hit two people with one grenade. I even had a sectoid take a shot at near point-blank against a full health soldier while two sectoids next to him paniced

**Fifth**: There are only three captures you need to make

* The Slingshot DLC guarantees a VERY EARLY capture that broke the entire game for me - Muton. As part of the Slingshot DLC, this is one of the safest Mutons you'll be able to capture. Interrogation gives a VERY EARLY Plasma research credit. Don't even bother to research laser weapons past standard laser rifles.  
* Early UFO missions will eventually net you a Berserker. These a VERY easy captures as they are straightforward to manipulate and they come charging at you. Armor research credit.  
* The hardest will be a Heavy Floater for flight credit. This is optional
As such - ""We Have Ways"" is one of the worse continent bonuses to get. You're not aiming to research EVERYTHING

**Sixth**: Medikits are God on council missions. Put one on EVERYBODY. Not many people seem to realise that Medikits infer immunity to poison. This allows you to pull Operation Bullshit Panic Flank on enemy Thin Men as if they were bigger

**Seventh**: Equipment is on-site procurement for weapons. Early on

**Eighth**: Research path: Rush all plasma weapons. Rush Titan Armor. Rush Firestorms. Rush Archangel Armor. Win game.

**Ninth**: Once you have ammo conservation, skip it and use the Alien Base Assault to restore order to a panicing country with a satellite before the end of the month. I had a bad mission which forced a lot of my main squad out of action. I skipped two landed UFO missions the next month and then used the Alien Base Assault to restore order to the world so nobody left.

**Tenth**: Take the Arc Thrower on the Alien Base Assault. The Sectoid Commander is at the back of the base and if you kill the usual pack of Chrisalids and Mutons he'll be the only creature left. Flank up to him using the highest level with your Arc Thrower character

**Eleventh**: You don't need a Firestorm in EVERY continent, Firestorms are nice as they can 1v1 any enemy ship with a dodge matrix so if you've got the spare flight computers just build three at once and then spread them around. Early plasma research also unlocks the powerful plasma cannon for air units, so air superiority is usually fine even with interceptors.

**Twelfth**: END THE GAME AS SOON AS YOU CAN. With rushed plasma, aim to win. After month 5 missions are HORRIBLE. Landed UFOs are HUGE and full of Sectopods. The fewer missions you do at this point the better. In my game I actually messed around, stalled out to complete all the research and turtled a bit to positively over-prepare (Did a ton of foundry research I didn't need, for example). I could have reasonably finished a month earlier than I did. I nearly lost the game because of it - One of the screenshots in the IMGUR album is of a Supply Barge after the 6th month. These corpses are all from one, long, endless skirmish and that's only as many as I could fit on the screen. There's no cover because I blew everything with flanking-panic tactics. Missions are NOT easy. End the game as soon as you have the capacity to.

**Thirteenth**: The final mission is EASY. Why? Scripted. You know where every enemy is, using a sight beacon to activate the cutscene and then shredding, rocketing and double tapping the etheral with backup from run and gun assaults or supports as required to deal any last dregs of damage (The 20+ shredded headshot crit from my sniper sealed the deal though.)

**Summary**:  

* Do not rush the first satellite. Wait until your first panic mission
* Abuse enemy panic to force 100% safe engagements where the enemy will NEVER return fire.  
* TRAIN UP YOUR SNIPER. Day 92 Colonel is OP. Day 92 Colonel Squad Sight Double Tap Sniper? GG.  
* Rush plasma weaponry. Capture an early outsider
* Rush titan armor after. This will usually be complete around the time your plasma stops 1-shotting things with crits.  
* Rush firestorms. They're flat out needed to shoot the cloaked Ethereal UFO down
* Rush Archangels. Firestorm research should pretty much have already unlocked this
* Win the game.",self,t5_2si6x,1370740926.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/1fygwp/just_completed_ironman_impossible_heres_a_few/

There are many complaining about certain difficulties being too hard. Shouldn't these people just lower their difficulty setting or do they deserve to beat the game on whatever difficulty they would like?

XCOM is punishing. It is unforgiving. It does not care if you win

I personally enjoy games that aren't meant to be beaten on a hard difficulty the first play through. XCOM WILL teach you how to play it if you play it long enough.

[*Vigilo*](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vigilo#Latin) is the first person present active indicative of the Latin verb *vigilare*, keep vigil*, so it could be translated, a little more figuratively, as *I am watchful* or *I am vigilant*. 

[*Confido*](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/confido#Latin) is the first person present active indicative of the verb *confidere*, believe, trust, place or put confidence in; rely upon*. It can be translated in two ways, effectively: The first interpretation is *I rely upon* or *I trust in*. What does *I trust* refer to? Well, it could refer to the first component of the motto, so in effect it would mean

*I trust that I am vigilant* 

or

*I trust in [my] vigilance* 

or 

*I rely upon [my] vigilance*. 

The second interpretation of the *confido* component just means *I am confident*

*I am vigilant - I am confident*. 

If we wanted to give this interpretation a poetic spin as well

*I am vigilant - I am steadfast*. 

Latin is a complicated language. Latin phrases can be translated and understood differently according to context, so for example instead of *I trust in vigilance* you could say something like *I place my trust in watchfulness*, or anything that suits your fancy. 

Now that you know

**TL;DR** The XCOM motto can mean: 

1. *I trust in vigilance*

2. *I am vigilant - I am steadfast* 

*Disclaimer* It's been a while since my Latin courses so any corrections/additions/whatnot more than welcome!

The reason I want to make this

I will start by adding a few ideas from other threads

I would be very happy if people would post more suggestions here. If you see something

**== Features ==**

 - **^1) Mappack** A very common request, jungle...) [wild9]

 - **^2) (Even) More Soldier Customization**  Another favorite. More helmets

 - **^3) Terror from the Deep** For those who didn't play it, they could bring a special atmosphere into the game. Definitely too big for a mod, but might be possible as downloadable content. Worst case scenario: Sequel.

 - **^4) Base defense** One of the coolest parts of the original was, the antfarm design and the fact that you only have one. ~~But it would be possible to add additional bases of operation, giving you more control across the globe in addition to just putting up satellites.~~ Interceptor bases could be fleshed out with a few customization options. This would provide nice stakes in the mission itself. [Topdawg540] It could also refine the panic management options the game gives you, especially mid to lategame. (France is in panic? We gotcha' we just put a military base into your country, so we get another chance to react to terror and abductions.)

 - **^5) Rival organizations** 'So France just gave you the boot? What are they doing now? Just giving up? Oh there is another organization that gets their funding. Oh so they want to use the alien technology to seize power after the invasion is dealt with? Oh and now they are sabotaging XCOM equipment to get even more members of the council on their side? Strike-1 -  show them that a plasma rifle is just as effective against terrorists.' This is vaguely inspired by Apocalypse's Organizations. I think the other organizations role should not be to complex, like in my story.

 - **^6) Better UFO interceptions** Tbh, by having to intercept a bombing run on a city or entering an airborne UFO, by blowing a hole in it's hull.

 - **^7) Cyber enhanced Soldiers** Very cool mod/dlc idea by [AreYouReadyToReddit]. Recover your mortally injured

 - **^8) Second Wave** These mods are basically in the game and are already partially unlocked. This is also just a general placeholder for any sorts of modifications, I will add them here.

 - **^9) Melee Weapons** Knives, bonus damage against unarmored opponents, zero damage against mechanical opponents? Could be a mixture of killing/arc-ing an enemy. (No corpse but you get the weapon) [gndn]

 - **^10) More Weapon types** Flamethrowers are always nice in the battle against aliens. [DeedTheInky] The classic XCOM also had napalm, Dart Guns, Toxic and Electric weapons have been seen in XCOMs of the past. Some of those are probably best kept for a potential sequel, but a few more weapon options, especially situational weapon options should be possible in the current tactical system. [ActionFlank] More upgrade options, that you have to choose from (read cannot afford all). Stun grenade and rockets to get a little breathing room. [PressureCereal]

 - **^11) Squads** The option to save premade squads or squad setups. It would give them a little flavour, anti robo ammo, if the scanners pick up sectopods). [peon47]

-------------

**== Patch/Small changes ==**

 - **^1) Official Modding Support** Bethesda/CD Project style. Firaxis/2K/T2 get clearance from legal. It helps the game. No really. There is still plenty of stuff that mods can never add. [at8mistakes]

 - **^2) Mind Controlling the only alien left ends the mission and the alien is taken as a live captive.** To balance, having your whole squad have a chance of panicking if your MC'ed alien dies is stupid, and should be removed. [PressureCereal]

 - **^3) Close doors!** If you are able to open them

 - **^4) Fixed Camera Level** I know this isn't a gameplay effect, because the camera chooses to reset and completely hide the entire squad under the ceiling - so extremely annoying. [PressureCereal]

 - **^5) Instant Battle/Skirmish mode** Once you've finished the campaign the game allows you to select Instant Battle. This will load a random map, pistols only, etc. [D0natell0]

 - **^6) Replay function** Possibility to re watch and record your battle after it's over. [D0natell0]

 - **^7) Better information on mission overview.**  I want to see terror level on all countries in affected continent when picking alien abduction mission. [fraggelsmurf] I personally would love to see my injured soldiers without having to 'Esc' out.

-------------

**== Mod only (things that are not in the game by design choice) ==**

 - **^1) Inventory system** The designers removed the more complex logistic elements in favor of just forcing the player to make more choices. In some of those cases I think a middle ground would have been more efficient.

 - **^2) More soldier stats** Like 1 I think a middle ground between RPG style stats and basically just 2-3 stats that are not really soldier specific are bit bland. I personally would even be satisfied if there was more variation in HP, forces a broader variety of different tactics. Right now, e.g. if all my soldiers wear the same armor, they usually have very similar HP and movement, which kinda monotonizes a few things. And in consequence giving me the choice to choose my soldiers class after he gets promoted at hand of his stats.

 - **^3) Take more than 6 soldiers per mission.** That has been a staple of all previous XCOM games. Even in the original game

 - **^4) Destroy environment by emptying the entire clip of a weapon in a single free aim attack.** There has been a lot of talk about having free aim, I don't see why free aim couldn't be a thing - I already use nades and rockets to remove cover. I thought emptying the entire clip and therefore making your soldier waste 2 turns - one to destroy the environment and one to reload - would be a sufficient time investment that maybe it would be balanced out.

 - **^5) Additional Elerium source** in some way. Potientially as a nother facility 

 - **^6) Creating your soldier from scratch.** Possibility to change gender



That's it for now. I will keep on adding anything that I notice, would be really happy if other people would like to participate! Also if my ideas are stupid/unrealistic, shoot them down/discuss.

I want to touch on the subject of how to approach decision making in xcom. This is not a rule but rather something that I have found to be very effective way of thinking:

**Work to minimize potential damage you will take at the end of each turn**

This essentially means two things:

1. Prioritize avoiding damage over dealing damage.
2. When comparing option A with B

Here is an example scenario:

You have two supports with one move remaining and one enemy in sight. One of your supports is in half cover

**Option A**

Take a shot with both supports.

You have 30.25% to miss both shots. If you do

**Option B**

Fire with full cover support
You have 55% chance to miss

**Option C**

Run away with half cover support
You have 100% chance to take fire on hunkered down full cover support.


Which is better? Well it depends on who you are fighting

After completion i headed back in and found that while I'd learned a lot

**Use Suppression fire early and often:** On my normal playthrough i found suppression a waste of a turn as most often my heavy could just shoot whatever he was targeting. I learned in classic that the best function of supression isn't the aim penalty (which becomes very nice in classic) but the fact that once you gain energy based weapons *suppression destroys cover*. First action is have the heavy or support suppress away cover

**Holo Targeting is actually amazing** As with suppression, thus holo-targeting becomes worthwhile when even a base muton might take 3 shots from a light plasma rifle if you're unlucky.

**Support are king** Support go from meh to critical when your troops actually start taking damage. Classic made me long for the days when i'd end late game terror missions with spare medkits. Currently i'm often making triage decisions by halfway through most combat larger than a small scout UFO. Don't neglect to have spares.

**All cover is not created equal** Low cover is acceptable when there is nothing else, but by the second mission of classic I learned that the difference is often the difference between a dead soldier and a live one.

Hey guys

Damage Roulette: Weapons have a wider range of damage. *(Disabled)
I actually started a game with this one on. It was kinda cool when the aliens shot me and only did 1 point of damage. It was NOT COOL when they did 5 damage (1 shotting a rookie behind full cover) and I did only 1. So after a few missions I did a quick restart without this option enabled. It might seem cool but when you are playing Ironman

New Economy: Randomized council member funding. (Enabled)
This one does not add a lot. Some country's may give 10-50 bucks more or less. On my play through I never saw anything go past 150 dollars (USA without this enabled). Overall its pretty cool and should be enabled even if you are playing on Ironman.

Not Created Equally: Rookies will have random starting stats.(Enabled)
I have to say it ""I LOVE THIS ONE"". Its probably the most awesome thing you can add to any play through. This gives you're soldiers a unique feel. I had rookies starting with up to 80 Aim. I also had rookies start with less then 55. Same goes with Will

Hidden Potential: As a soldier is promoted
I have to say it again ""I LOVE THIS ONE"". Hidden Potential is really amazing especially paired with Not Created Equally. I had soldiers gain as much as 7 points per level. I also them gain none
I found the meanest rookie I had, that is 19 more Aim then a standard colonel sniper who has 105 at the end of the game. But this also swings the other way, I had a rookie with 80 Aim, given a LMG. When she hit Colonel her aim was still only 84. But her Will was in the high 70s. Even at the end of the game when I had multiple Colonel just in case something went wrong I had to ask the questions, do I value higher Will over higher Aim. Or even when I receive a new recruit from a mission. Do I think they will have better stats late game or not?

Red Fog: Combat wounds will degrade the soldier's mission stats. (Disabled)
I really wanted to run this one. But in the end chose not to. I am not sure how harshly this impacts a soldiers Aim (as getting shot already lowers Will). But its something I might revisit in a later play through.

Absolutely Critical: A flanking shot guarantees a critical hit. (Enabled)
I really liked this one. How ever, and in this way makes the game less about luck.

The Greater Good: Psionics can only be learned from interrogating a psionic alien.
A fine addition. Just snag the first guy from the base mission. Pretty cool

Marathon: The game takes considerably longer to complete. (Enabled)
This makes the game really easy. I had a Colonel on the second terror mission. With a few Majors following in his foot steps. Over all, you might have a Major if you're lucky.

Results Driven: A country offers less funding as its panic level increases.(Disabled)
This is the last one I had disabled. I was not sure how this would impact the game with Diminishing Returns

High Stakes: Random rewards for stopping alien abductions.
Pretty cool feature, like 1 country offering 2 engineers, while the other one is offering 5. Instead they just change how much you get.

Diminishing Returns: Increased cost of satellite construction.
Man this one is a bitch. I almost failed the game because I did not have any satellites. The first one cost me 500. The next one cost me 900. At the end of the game I had only 6 satellites with the next one needing almost 2800 and 68 engineers. Overall good if you want to try and rush the game. 

More Than Human: The psionic gift is extremely rare.
I got my psionic on my second batch. So it seems like the chance is reduced by 50% from first look. Also note

I have not beaten the game yet on Impossible

2. If you overwatch with a squadsight sniper

3. Battle scanners don't reveal an area, meaning they can't see through walls, floors, or around corners.

4. The soldiers you start the game with have 2 less hp than soldiers you recruit after the game starts via the barracks menu.

5. Aliens stunned by arc throwers stay stunned forever. Edit: Stunned enemies WILL die if an explosion occurs nearby them.

6. Enemies that know where your squad is

7. The star by a soldier's name means they are squad leader. If they die

8. When you research a SHIV in the foundry

9. Scientists aren't acutally needed

10. On the other hand

11. The defense stat affects aim. Every 1 defense is a -1% penalty to anything trying to hit that unit.

12. Low cover is 20 defense

13. Capturing aliens allows you to recover their weapons

14. The bonus for having a base in NA only applies to aircraft

15. Sectopods are assholes.

EDIT: 16. The PC version allows you to select units that have already moved by clicking them. They can then perform ""free"" actions, or switching weapons, (this allows you to move a sniper, switch to pistol, overwatch, then switch back.) The PS3 and Xbox360 versions cannot do this.

#17. Gravely wounded soldiers lose Will permanently.

#18. If you put a facility so it borders two other facilities of the same type (like an L formation) then you recieve two adajaceny bonuses.

Now, *why*? As a little icebreaker, here's what I went with first game...

**Old Squad**

2 Snipers

That basically just happened because they were the first squaddies I ever got, and I grabbed two soldiers, a sniper and a support from mission rewards (I didn't know back then, forgive me!) and that worked pretty well. 

Now, at least not for my play style. My double-tap sniper wasn't nearly as practical and guaranteed-smashing as an assault, and a medic-support was the weakest part of the team. I really enjoyed having two heavies on board, simply for the amount of improvisation they give with heat ammo, suppression and bulletstorm on each, so they're staying, which means ditching a sniper

~

    New Squad

1 Sniper, 1 Support

**Sniper:**

* Squadsight (Best ability they have)

* Damn Good Ground (Compliments Squadsight perfectly)

* Disabling Shot (Which I prefer to Battle Scanner because it counters Mind Control

* Opportunist (So many great kills on guys sneaking up on the squad)

* In The Zone (Beautiful ability for crowd control

My only sniper. Due to the lack of their mobility

**Heavy**

* Bullet Swarm (Just dominates the alternative)

* Suppression (Superior to the Shredder Rocket so much. You can control the alien movements with 2-3 suppressors easily.)

* Heat Ammo (Because machines are the only *big* enemies that scare me

* Danger Zone (I save my rockets until emergency situations. When those situations arise

* Mayhem (Goes really well with Danger Zone!)

All in all, and it's a fairly nicely rounded build, all things complimenting eachother, making suppression the best move in the game (especially with Ammo Conservation from the foundry). There's a reason I have 2 of these guys, and it's cause they kick ass!

**Assault**

Now here's where I'd like some assistance and input. Honestly, a long range and a short? [Here's the wiki so you can look](http://xcom.wikia.com/wiki/Assault_Class), would love the feedback!

**Support**

* Covering Fire (Extra movement really isn't needed on my support... if it was assault, so great for controlling their brains!)

* Smoke and Mirrors (Prefer to keep my guys alive than mop up the pieces... there are always 2-3 times a smoke grenade would really help

* Revive (Two heavies frees up another suppression slot

* Dense Smoke (Because smoke bombs become SWEET with this.)

* Sentinel (Makes him an overwatch machine with this in addition to Covering Fire)

~

Discussion of the options:

- Damage roulette.  Seems to unequivocally make the game harder.  Hitting for 1 sucks a lot.  I'm curious how I will feel about it once I am beyond the basic weapons and/or fighting guys where randomly rolling high could be a win.

- New economy.  Interesting

- Not created equally: Definitely makes the game easier (random +15 aim guys)

- Hidden potential: makes the game slightly easier, and hasn't gained any aim after levelling after that.  Meanwhile my 'pretty good' sniper has graduated to ridiculousness status with an extra hp and more aim than colonels in regular games.  It's kind of interesting having a reliable shot but *without* the double tap/ITZ perk that makes it completely broken.

Without having played with them at all, but I think I tend to take more flanking shots than the aliens), and Red Fog if it applies to aliens (which I doubt it does).

I'm still getting teleporting aliens; my classic game had the graveyard map and two different groups of inactive sectoids teleported and had a full turn after activating.

For example, 2 support, 1 sniper, I usually like to move my assaults first, the heavy/support next, and sniper last. To circle through the team in this order,  I would order my squad:

    .Slot1....Slot2....Slot3...Slot4...Slot5...Slot6..    

    ..5th......2nd......1st.....3rd.....4th.....6th..

Then....a very large UFO came. I was nervous, luckily. No worries. Saw some mutons including 2 Beserkers - dead. Awesome.

Then, I should kill that alien quick before I take the cockpit and end the mission."" And so I left 2 people to cover the cockpit door, and sent 4 outside to the left to start the quick search/kill. 

10 TURNS LATER (not fucking joking) 

I'm still outside. I had found some Mutons - killed 3 but I saw 5 - could NOT FIND the other 2 for the longest time. Finally deciding I was imagining things

They. Wouldn't. Leave. Cover. 

I threw grenades. Damage, but I couldn't get close enough to kill them. It was basically a fucking draw - but Xcom doesn't allow draws so I had to do something. 

Long story short  - everything I tried failed and I ended up doing some crazy shit that worked out as you'd expect - all 4 squad members dead. In the end I **finally** got the last 2 mutons using my 2 soliders who were guarding the cockpit. 

So then I go back to the cockpit (3 turns later) and BOOM! 2 energy guys. They pull a random low-percentage shot and kill 1 of my squad right off. Great. Now I have 1 vs 2 - and it's not looking good. I play an actual game of cat and mouse - running all over the ship, going outside and trying to flank - it was epic. We're talking a good 8 turns of this shit. 

In the end - I killed 1 of the energy guys but the other one - sigh - was hiding in a corner on overwatch and killed me. MY ENTIRE SQUAD WIPED OUT...AGAIN. I was at the fucking cockpit with all 6 soldiers and then suddenly - they're all dead. Fuck you

So...there I was. A failed mission. 6 squad dead. I have 4 FUCKING ROOKIES left in my barracks - that's it. I was about to quit but then thought - fuck it. I'll keep going. Why not. So I trudged on

I purchased 10 new soldiers and then did the smartest thing I've done yet - I purchased the Officer Training School perk that makes all rookies into squaddies. That means they each are assigned a class the moment they show up. Because of this, assault, and 2 support. 

I gave all of them yellow armor - because --- I don't know. They are the last hope. Why not yellow. Anyway

Fast forward all weekend - as of now

Anywayyy, was a breakthrough. I've always read that you should prioritize abduction missions in some form of this mantra: Panic level 4+ &gt; Engineers &gt; Money &gt; Soldiers &gt; Scientists

While the above is pretty straight forward, and if 8 withdraw, you lose the game. But is it always wise to pick the country with panic level 4+ if the other two are 1-2? No! Because when you finish the mission, the country in which you did it loses panic level, but the entire continents of the countries you ignored will gain panic.

So go back to your world map and look at the continents. If, Germany (Panic 1), and let's say Japan (Panic 3), you would normally pick Canada, right? But if USA and Mexico are relatively calm, and Asia is all 2-3 panic level, but Europe is all panic level 3-4 (except Germany)

I don't know if this was common knowledge

Some other helpful tips for Classic Ironman (or any difficulty/mode):

1. Start in Africa

2. At the very start of each month, 3 x Satellites; Month 3 - Satellite Uplink - 3 x Satellites; Month 4 - Satellite Nexus - 5 x Satellites (MAKE SURE THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED)

3. 5 days before each month

4. Although it's not the best strat for building up a good amount of weapon fragments, they give you some peace of mind to scout with your first soldier or two, because even if you reveal enemies in positions that may not offer cover, one of your remaining heavies are likely able to hit them with a rocket (and early on, 6 damage is usually enough to kill).

5. With correct play, instead of Alien Materials and carapace armor.

6. If you have the slingshot DLC, 4 engineers, 2 scientists, $200, and ~$2,000 worth of material)

7. Don't ignore ships. Make sure to have one aim, and keep track of which continents have satellites and how many interceptors they have. For one satellite, you only need one interceptor. But have at least two in continents with full coverage. By Month 4+, consider having a satellite or two in storage in case one gets taken down (you can replace it instantly) and for requests.

8. I personally like to wait on researching Xeno Biology (for Alien Containment) until I have my finances etc in order. This means (for me) that I want full satellite coverage before I even begin with the storyline missions. May take longer

Ever move to a safe flanking position

Ever started sweating... because you *think* that you're just outside of that Chryssalid's movement range... and it starts moving towards you...

Well, Xcom Wikia, UFOpaedia, and /r/Xcom have all disappointed. Both Xcom Wikia and UFOpaedia just straight up datamine range entries from game files, which doesn't help because the in game range units are different to tiles. There's bits here and there, so I've decided to collect it all together here. I owe it to the dead soldier that made me look it up.


I had looked up the movement of a Chryssalid before my first encounter, so I thought it meant that their movement allowance was 20 tiles. So I put one of my brave men 12 tiles away, since, if you have to  double move, you can't attack. He died. This then made me look up what all the ranges meant. To my surprise, the majority of range values in most resources are useless to the player because they haven't been converted to tiles.

1. Range in game files =/= tiles
To convert range units into tiles

2. Diagonals are calculated using a pythagorian triangle
If you forgot
Moving 5 tiles straight
An alien 12 tiles along 1 axis, which mean out of sight range.

3. Stuff useful to know

*Sight range - 17 tiles

*Half/Single move - 7 tiles

*Dash/Double move - 15 tiles

*Weapon penalty/bonus threshold(see below) - 10 tiles

*Chryssalid single move - 12 tiles

*Frag Grenade - 9 tiles

*Rocket Launcher - 17 tiles

Basically, name it after yourself, customize it to your hearts content, and then play that rookie through the entire rest of the game. Each turn consists of you moving your soldier (and ONLY your soldier) and then handing the controller off to the next player.

I will admit it has some downsides. We've been playing with only 3 people, losing one of your 3 soldiers to sickbay means you're now running a mission with a severely understrength squad. We play that if one of the people isn't available to play, their soldier cannot join missions.

The upside, and none of my buddies were in range to help me. I've crafted my lone soldier all the way from recruit to colonel, and I've never felt more protective of any soldier in XCOM before.

[Spoilers],SleepDeprivedPegasus,56,9,8,"Let me start off by saying that I avoided all spoilers and had no idea what the story of this game was going to be so it was all an amazing new experience that just happened to turn out in the most movie-like manner possible.

I've had two soldiers with me through the entire campaign that survived through it all; Ross 'Mad Dog' Meyers, being the sniper, had the highest will so she was chosen instead. 

On the last mission, an assault and my heavy. All that were left standing were my SHIV, Garza and Mad Dog. They were all wounded quite severely and I knew this would be my final turn. It was all or nothing. I sent Mad Dog straight at the leader in a final rush; used run and gun to get him a step away; he got one good shot in but the other was reflected. The leader was still at half health. My SHIV was engaged on the other side of the room but I moved it as close I could to make the shot. It missed. It was all up to Garza now; she had to make the shot or it was over. She lined up her shot and bang. She had done it. 

The final cut scene was straight out of a movie. Garza and Meyers

Gentlemen

Mod Idea:  A Cyborg Creation Mod.

General Concept:

You bring a soldier back from the dead in a weakened state

Requirements:

1. The Soldier must be a Major or higher. The council wouldn't want their funds wasted on a rookie.

2. You must have a Foundry. This is

3. You must have the S.H.I.V. researched.

4. You must have autopsied all Floaters.

5. You must have Cyborg Resurrection Researched. (New research provided by the mod.)

6. You must have the corpse. (Not sure if this would be possible to mod

End Result:

You are given a reskinned Soldier of the same class with the same name.  They have the following attributes:

1. They revert to Rank 3--it's tough to remember the skills they were taught.

2. They gain experience at half the rate of human squad members.

3. They

4. If wounded

5. If they die again


End Result: You have a trooper that is stronger than a normal one

We can use those red shield ""you will be flanked!"" warnings to estimate.  Red shield means the alien can see and shot your unit if he moves to that tile, while tile C, D and E are certainly out of range.  

This method can also be used to check if a tall structure or stopping at the ramp may obscure the line of sight.  You cannot use this method if the aliens are only Berserker or Chryssalid since they cannot shot.  The info you get is an estimate but can be quite reliable.

Their big design problem is that the location-time-pressure is basically impossible to balance.  Mid game

Recently I've been trying to get into impossible, where it could go either way.  I spent several turns 1-turn-away-from-exploding, just barely making it to the next power node while beating off the sectoids and single thinman spawn.  I lost one squadmember and another was hanging on at 1hp, but I managed to eke out a half turn on one of my heavies to heal her.

Then I defused the bomb.  And the game spawns 24 hp of aliens on overwatch on top of me.  WTF?

I take out two from my position, by the way; they seem to get cover even when the cover isn't facing the right direction), one of the other two flanks my medkit guy and kills him, and the last manages to hit my remaining two troops with poison.  From there it's basically game over.

Now I see why people say to immediately abort bomb missions on impossible.  I don't think it's at all possible to win there

1353319726.0,13g130,Early game build order for classic\impossible,MadrushnRU,48,7,15,"Hi

I’ve used this tactic to a great success – finished classic ironman and now making my way through impossible (about to assault alien base, most needed foundry\officer school upgrades and light plasma for all squads on month 4)

So here goes:

**Starting place:**

Choose either Africa or South America as starting point, as it is easier to cap South America (only two countries).  

**Research timing:**

Our goal here is to rush to laser weapon tech

1)	Choose weapon fragments as the first research. As well as being necessary for laser

2)	You can only research laser after your first UFO mission. Before that get started on alien materials

3)	When you get laser start on the alien capture tree. Get Alien Biology and arc thrower and start raking in the captives

4)	Do not research any bodies\make interrogations until you get the South Africa bonus. If everything goes well you should get it by the end of the second month.  When you do go through all the autopsies and interrogations (they will be instant). 

5)	After the interrogations are done you should have earned good credit on many research fields. Start working on alien materials and get carapace armor.

6)	Next is tricky. If you were good with your captures you should have bunch of light plasma rifles by now. However

7)	Meanwhile start working on the advanced fighter craft tech (alien computer, once you get your hands on a Muton, get back to those light plasma. 

8)	By now every one of your guys should have carapace, so now your task is to get air superiority ASAP. I suggest researching plasma cannons (you can get it after light plasma) and new fighter craft. 

9)	After that you can pretty much relax. Get plasma

**Production**
	**General base layout\production\mission tips:**

1)	For maximum efficiency you want to plan your sat uplinks  to form a square (yep

X  S  S  L  X  X  X

X  S  S  L  X  X  X

2)	Satellite uplinks take 15 days to build. The number of satellites only counts during council review at the end of the month

3)	Satellites take 20 days to build. Never start a satellite earlier than 20 days before the end of the month

4)	When choosing abduction missions try to always go for engineers as they are vital to keep your uplink production up. Other matters to consider are countries – try not to go to countries that you plan to cover with satellites this month

**Month 1**

1)	After the initial mission check out you base layout. If there is a stream vent in close proximity (no more than 1 level down and 2 drills away) go for it. Otherwise get a normal generator

2)	 Do not start any satellites\uplinks yet. Wait for the first abduction

3)	After the first UFO raid sell all computers\power sources. They won’t be necessary for a while and rake up quite a bit of cash

4)	At the end of the first month use the satellite to either save one of the South America\Asia countries or

**Month 2**

1)	Again

2)	Sell all UFO loot from month 2 as well to fund the activity.

3)	By now you should get your laser rifles research finished. Kit out your squad (usually alloys would be the restricting point

4)	Make sure you get enough gens to power the upcoming uplink

5)	When 15 days are left you should definitely get the second abduction. Get Engineers and order the second uplink

6)	Do not start an officer school yet. You won’t be able to afford anything.

7)	You can get an alien containment though. Sell some corpses if you have to (on impossible selling corpses is actually really good

8)	At the end of the month you will have 3 satellites ready to launch. This should be enough to get South America and to placate another country. Start working towards Asia

9)	As soon as you get South America get ready for a huge knowledge boost – research all bodies and interrogate all the aliens you have got.

**Month 3**

1)	Well

2)	Keep satellite\uplink production in check (you should send out 3 more at the end of this month)

3)	Get a bunch of interceptors (at least 2) in all areas under control

4)	By now you should have researched carapace

**Month 4**

1)	If all went well you should have 8 countries under control which means a lot of funding.  Get the foundry (reload and first aid are a must; arc upgrade is good for raking in Mutons for heavy &amp; normal plasma). 

2)	Get max squad size

3)	By now you should really be struggling with UFOs. Get a lot of interceptors and do no be afraid to pop a couple of power-ups for each battle. 

4)	Work towards the final uplink. You shouldn’t need more than 4 on impossible. On classic consider getting a nexus.

5)	You should be able to kit your guys with looted light plasma. After that concentrate your research on ships

**Month 5**

1)	If you made it this far you should be ok. By now you should have a 1200+ income, titan armor and lot’s of new ships.

1350884567.0,11vt9e,Impossible tactical discussion,stillnotking,52,8,28,"I have yet to beat Ironman Impossible

When I first moved up to Impossible, it's no more true than it is on any other difficulty. You *can* dramatically influence the odds with smart play, and I've gotten much better at the game over the course of many failed II attempts. Here are a few of the things I've figured out.

**Full cover isn't worth much.** The combination of the aliens' superior numbers, even if all your soldiers are in full cover. Rather than digging in and shooting it out, what you want to do is minimize the number of shots enemies get to take, either by killing them quickly or by staying completely out of their line of sight. Putting a soldier in the line of fire is a big risk that must be justified by the possibility of a big reward. For example, it may seem tempting to park your soldier behind a truck in full cover to take 45-50% potshots at an alien in partial cover, but that is not an adequate management of risk, unless you can do it with several soldiers on a lone enemy in the same turn. The computer can lose that sectoid or muton and still have plenty of firepower left, 20%, meaning you watch patiently for opportunities and then capitalize on them to the max. Coordinated assaults are key (e.g. destroy enemy cover

**Be aware of potential spawns.** Familiarity with the maps helps a lot here, but that isn't really true. You *can* maneuver, and in fact you have to maneuver to win, but you have to be careful about it. For example, don't send your Assault guy on a flanking Run &amp; Gun charge into an unexplored corner. One thing that helps is to try to fight on the edges of maps when you can -- when conducting your initial exploration, head down the side rather than up the middle, and enter buildings by the back doors. The sides of the map are safe from spawning enemies, of course, but explore the rest of the map first. Sometimes it can be tedious

**Use Overwatch intelligently.** Don't Overwatch just because you have nothing better to do. If you are in an alien's LOS and can't/don't want to take the shot, Overwatching the corner of a building or other likely cover spot isn't helpful if you expect an unseen enemy to move *into* that cover. Overwatch triggers when you see something move out of, not into, a tile. OTOH, Overwatch is extremely useful when exploring and is the main reason you should have your entire squad together while doing so. Getting 3 or 4 reaction shots on a patrol that moves into view can make all the difference.

**Abuse explosives.** One might think that grenades and rockets would be less valuable in Impossible given the enemies' increased health, for damaging groups of enemies, and for dealing damage without putting yourself in LOS (the long range of rockets is indispensable for this). Tell Dr. Vahlen to shut her pie hole about ""using restraint"" -- all you lose by killing enemies with explosives is a few weapon fragments, which are, believe me, *not* in short supply on Impossible.

**Have a backup plan.** Move order for your soldiers is crucial on Impossible. In general, so you can adjust your plan if it fails. Maybe you Run &amp; Gun that alien instead of the one you were hoping to. Try never to put yourself in situations where you *must* make a shot or else someone dies, although this is sometimes unavoidable.

**All soldiers are not created equal.** I get the most use out of the Heavy and Assault classes on Impossible. Heavies excel at taking out huge swaths of enemies/enemy cover, and I have a hell of a time getting Support in particular to gain rank. I will go far out of my way to protect Assault/Heavy soldiers of Corporal rank or higher, even throwing the aliens a free rookie to kill instead if I have to.

**Failure IS an option.** On the topic of protecting soldiers, but the loss is probably not unrecoverable; losing your best soldiers can be. High-ranked soldiers are always the resource in shortest supply on Impossible.

**Don't get frustrated.** You will have really bad turns occasionally. Your captain will miss a 96% shot and get smoked, you will lose battles you might have won. It's never over 'til it's over, and the nice thing about turn-based games is you can easily step away from the computer for a while and come back when you know you're thinking clearly.

**Miscellaneous tips.**  

* Switch to pistol to kill enemies with 1 health left. Also
* Always reload and wait for cooldowns before looking for more enemies.
* Keep track of who has killed what and who has earned a promotion already. Soldiers never promote more than one rank in a mission
* It's very, and one mistake can cost the game. Thin Men are *extremely* dangerous on Impossible due to their +10 aim from light plasma and their natural crit buff.  
* Have a complete understanding of cover/flanking mechanics. This almost goes without saying
* Get the Officer School the second it becomes available. IMO this is an even higher priority than satellite coverage.

The long ranged assaults have better average dmg performance while still having the ability to run&amp;gun + double shot to the face

Here's the jist of it

* Light plasma rifle + scope + rapid fire (double shot): you get 20% per shot which offset the -15% penalty. This is really strong when combined with any buff to shooting.

* Agression (+10% crit per enemy in sight) instead of tactical sense (+5 def per enemy in sight): This is kinda up to your preference

* lightning reflex (duh)

* Bring 'em on (+1 ~~dmg~~ **crit dmg** per enemy in squad sight) instead of close combat specialist: Even with the shotgun close ranged assaults

Note that when you rapid fire someone to the face you'll most likely crit twice (just like the shotties assault) and because of Bring 'em on you'll do similar dmg. Also, also heavies are just as bad.

1350165975.0,11flac,Issues with XCOM,Internet_Gentleman,42,5,115,"Wrote up a review of the game

It’s a brilliant game, which is supposed to be the same difficulty as the original X-COM. The problem is that it is difficult, but it’s not difficult in the right areas. The AI does get smarter, yes, but the game also messes with the percent chances for you to hit and be hit. As a result you get the feeling that you’re not really fighting a smarter enemy, Firaxis just skewed the dice against you and called it “hard”. And it is hard, believe me. But winning in it doesn’t feel like an accomplishment as much as pure luck. Your highly-trained and competent soldiers from Normal turn into bumbling idiots that can’t hit an alien three feet away. These are supposed to be the best of the best of the best that Earth has to offer, circling around a squad of aliens can be more dangerous than just taking your chances with 30% chance to hit shots, with the aliens frequently making really stupid tactical mistakes

Another issue I have is the concept of “Overwatch”. Basically, it’s very annoying.

Also, but not the ones standing ones square away above them on the ramp. I’ve had heavy mobile soldiers pop into existence in the middle of my squad with no warning or reason. I’ve had extraction zones just disappear, which is not good when your squad is barely holding it together and need to NOPE their way to safety. Instead my remaining officers just got to do a heroic last stand that accomplished nothing. The majority of the game is polished, but again. In a game with permadeath like this, this shit can’t happen.

Things looked grim

The team? Two heavies

They moved slowly to a side entrance and then breached it, it killed a single civilian... and things went bad. Two floaters on the second floor floated into sight.

At this point, I used excessive force and sent a rocket flying right into their ugly alien faces. I thought losing 3-4 civilians was worth not failing this mission completely. And guess what, when the rocket exploded, it showed 5 damage indicators. The floater threat was eliminated for now, at the cost of some ""collateral"" damage. The chryssalid was then easily dispatched by the rest of the team.

First off:  Don't attempt to do this one on Classic/Impossible. Definitely try this one on Normal/Easy.


This achievement requires you to have a soldier ""survive"" every mission during an entire play through.  Unfortunately the wording of the achievement is a little vague - this soldier also needs to ATTEND every mission on an entire play through. Which means that they can't be wounded and spend time in the infirmary.


What worked for me


Following the first mission of the game you'll probably have one of your soldiers earn the Sniper class. Take this soldier on every mission in the game but never move them from the position that the squad starts in. 


Make sure to give this soldier the Squad Sight perk. 


With just this perk alone this Sniper will be one of your first Colonels and won't run the risk of being wounded by aliens since they'll stay at the starting area for the remainder of the game leaving you to complete all of your missions using 3-5 soldiers.

1376023189.0,1k0a7t,I almost felt bad retreating after this happened.,FayeGrimm,41,6,11,"So I've been working through my second(ish) IC attempt and just went through my first battleship. This was pretty late in the game and I was just working on picking up some extra tech and training up my psi squad for the final mission. I've never taken on a battleship before so I really had no idea what to expect inside. It didn't help that my relay told me there wouldn't even be any sectopods.

----------------

So the team lands on the ship and takes up positions. They're a solid group of veteran psi soldiers with a couple of newer medics along for the ride. Our team cleared the first several rooms easily, but they weren't complaining. Erin, our CQC specialist moves towards the other door hoping to take the enemy offguard as James gives the all clear from his crow's nest position behind the team.

Shane breaches the door to reveal another 2 squads of mutons

Erin, I need backup NOW!"" She whispered into her radio as a heavy floater jetted through the door, presumably trying to spot her for the big guns.

James covered the team with his sniper as they rushed over to support their comrade. The moment they were out in the open however

Erin clutched her shotgun to her chest and took a deep breath. ""Klaus, faded away she turned the corner and charged. It was quick work conquering one of those flying beast's mind, and he was all too happy to divebomb the mechanical monster. His rifle barely scratched its armor by the time the red beam was charged. The floater didn't stand a chance, but in such close quarters, the explosion caught his brethren's fuel line and he too went spiraling out of the skies. That was all the time Erin needed. Her cloak faded away as she leaped onto the sectopod, shotgun in hand. She didn't expect to make it out of that hallway, but several explosions later

----------------

Seeing a soldier single-handedly take down a squad of heavy floaters and a sectopod without taking a scratch simply amazed me. I wanted to keep going after that, and who knows what else left to face I couldn't take the risk. I just hope seeing her team home safe was enough of a reward for Col. Erin.

I start off in America
When you start off, the price of satellites will be $77 instead of 100.  Build 2 satellites and a workshop.  Research Arc-Throwers (after that, research weapon fragments).  Scan forward to the first alien UFO.  This usually occurs before day 16.  On this mission, do your best to not destroy too much of the UFO.  After the mission, sell everything you need to buy a Satellite Uplink.  You don't need any computer/ufo equipment for a LONG time.  There will be other UFOs and more Insectoid bodies - sell as needed.  Try not to sell elerium, alloys, or weapon fragments.  If you have spare money start excavating your base in preparation for your alien containment and power plant x 2.  You may even be able to buy your first power plant immediately.  If so, use your money infusion to build the alien containment facility
You will have 3 satellites in orbit and the containment center finished.  On your 2nd UFO mission capture both the crystal man and an insectoid.  Since you've been neglecting research
The first thing I normally build in month 2 is: Access Shaft and Officer School.  
I'm usually ready to assault the base before month 2 ends.  At this point, I can't see how you could reasonably lose any countries from this point.

Rookie A steps forward behind a car.  Sectoids spotted! Well that was quick...  2 run off into the building and 1 hides behind a different car.  I run Rookies B and C to the truck close to the building and Rookie D up with A.  Only A and D fire. They score a miss and 3 dmg respectively.  

Deadeye McSectoid snipes Rookie A.  Rookie D loses his shit and panics.  He then proceeds to fire upon Rookie B.  He criticals Rookie B, it killed him. 

Technical Triple kill for Deadeye McSectoid.

Rookie C stands alone on turn 2, runs in to make sure he doesn't get the 4th.  Leroy Sectoid runs in for the final kill on a cowering Rookie C.

1373493151.0,1i1cut,How I learned to stop worrying and love SHIVs,zyxophoj,48,12,11,"After the SHIVCOM video was posted here

**Early game - Basic SHIV:**  This would be good if we could afford the cost.  But we can't

**Mid game - Alloy/Laser SHIV:**  Now this is more like it.  18 hitpoints is a lot at this stage of the game, so all they can do is get (non-critical) shots on it with their pistols.  It's also handy on council missions for a similar reason - it forces thin men to use an attack which is capable of missing, and it can take at least 2 light plasma hits without dying.

**Late game - Hover/Plasma SHIV:**  This is still useful, or a big fat range bonus by getting right in an alien's face.  I used them to keep my human soldiers alive.  There are many ways it can help with this.  

When attacking a UFO control room, but I'd rather lose the tank than lose a human.

Against anything else, it can always suppress.  Any defensive buff makes it very hard to hit.  Aliens really hate the flying SHIV and will spend many actions trying to kill it.  

**General notes** 

SHIVS can rescue civilians and disarm bombs.   Unfortunately

SHIVs can be repaired by hacked drones.  In my last playthrough, but it's something.

SHIVs are fast, have very good accuracy, and are ultimately expendable.  This makes them ideal flankers.  I try to let humans get the kills, but if they all miss, a hover SHIV can reliably finish the job.

Wouldn't it be interesting if we could develop new equipment based on unexplored items from the game?

Researching **Alien Food** could give us hints of what the aliens can and cannot ingest,  we could have our version of the Thin Men's Poison Cloud or something, using it with our Heavy Class soldiers. Maybe the Stun Bomb would work only on specific aliens, with the poison-resistan Thin Men and the superdrugged Beserker being immune to it.

**Alien Entertainment** could help us understand their culture or how they react to some imagens and sounds

**Alien Surgery** could help us understand more about alien fisiology and, giving them all **bonus Critical chances**.

It could enable yet another Foundry project to upgrade our medical facilities with some of their technology, or maybe it could be one of those projects with 2 levels – one for each of these research.

I get really attached to my characters, and had the highest kill count.  Yeti(another one of my friends), a German heavy was a hero.  On the graveyard mission, two of my soldiers were on the lowground hunkered down when 2 floaters, 3 thinmen and 3 sectoids teleported on their location.  I like to envision that the enemies were actually underground and rose from the graves.  With one rocket, Yeti took out a majority of the enemies and saved the squad from a sticky situation.  Yeti would continue to save the squad in future missions with his trusty rockets.

However, and while Yeti did not die from the explosion, he died from enemy fire.  Colonel Ice, witnessed one of his best friends die, but the death didn't end there.  He would witness another best friend Captain Samurai(me), being ripped to shreds by a cyrsalid.  He would witness his friend turn into a zombie and attack his fellow squadmates.  Having the best shot he would end his best friends suffering by shooting him in the head.  Our cocky sniper would quickly turn into a hardened and cynical veteran.  

After telling my friends these stories they were quickly interested and decided to check it out.  The plan was to head to my place for an hour and I would show them Xcom

By the time I got to the final room, the other with the +will +crit. I still had all my rockets, one heavy had 1 shredder 2 rockets w/increased dmg, the other 1 shredder 1 rocket. 

So I had my medic that had no packs left run out (more like inch out till saw the aliens.) Still had movement left so that I could retreat, managed to land two crits. Then I had my medic run as much as she could back to the door. 

Alien movement. 

I have my medic run back to the spotting point, she can still be revived. My turn I pop the smoke, (+will +crit) to cover sniper, heavy and it reached up to just the doorway (friendly side.) Put my guys on overwatch. 

Alien movement.

My turn have my medic revive the other medic which then spots the two aliens in the screenshot. Sniper has no shot. Have the heavy without the dmg increase to rockets shoot a shredder rocket at the round thing in the middle, i had killed the aliens in that one go. 

I can say that one thing that did help out early game was that in my previous attempts of trying to beat impossible ironman

Today

Satellite Deployment seems to be the way of steadily increasing your council funding from countries in both $Credits and Staff (Scientists and Engineers) but also looks to allow you to capture the bonuses from other countries - making that starting base location decision a little easier to swallow.

**Satellite Deployment**

One satellite can be deployed per country listed on the continent.

* Africa: 3
* Asia: 4
* Europe: 4
* North America: 3
* South America: 2

Total Satellites Needed for full coverage: 16

Each Sattelite Requires 5 Engineers and $77 to build (unsure if NA bonus was applied). For 16 Satellites

Each Satellite Uplink Requires 5 Power

That puts each Satellite at a cost of (calculating in the Satellite Uplink costs):
* 2.5 Power
* 7.5 Engineers
* $152
* 13 Days

The total cost to have complete Satellite coverage, $2432

Countries

* USA: +$180/month
* Russia: +$150/month
* Canada: +$100/month
* China: +$100/month
* Germany: +$100/month
* Japan: +$100/month
* Nigeria: +$100/month
* United Kingdom: +$100/month
* Brazil: +$80/month
* France: +$80/month
* South Africa: +$80/month
* Argentina: +$70/month
* Egypt: +$70/month
* Australia: +$60/month
* India: +$60/month
* Mexico: +$50/month

If a player focused on the critical path for building Satellites only, the deployment would look like this:

* Janury - $330
* February - $530
* March - $730
* April - $1010
* May - $1170, Bonus: Expert Knowledge
* June - $1310, Bonuses: We Have Ways, All In
* July - $1480, Bonus: Future Combat


It would be interesting to see analysis based on the benefits allowed from taking an income

Another interesting analysis would be the critical paths for getting continent bonuses and their value in time versus their cost savings.

Each continent breaks down by the following:

**Africa**

* 1: +1 Engineer Per Month
* 2: +1 Scientist
* 3: +1 Scientist
* Bonus: All in

* Egypt: +$70/month
* Nigeria: +$100/month
* South Africa: +$80/month

Total Africa: +250/month **||** Average Country: $83.33

**Asia**

* 1: +1 Engineer Per Month
* 2: +2 Engineers Per Month
* 3: +3 Engineers Per Month
* 4: +4 Engineers Per Month
* Bonus: Future Combat

* Australia: +$60/month
* China: +$100/month
* India: +$60/month
* Japan: +$100/month

Total Asia: $320/month || Average Country: $80

**Europe**

* 1+1 Scientist Per Month
* 2+2 Scientists Per Month
* 3+3 Scientists Per Month
* 4+4 Scientists Per Month
* Bonus: Expert Knowledge

* France: +$80/month
* Germany: +$100/month
* Russia: +$150/month
* United Kingdom: +$100/month

Total Europe: $430/month **||** Average Country: $107.5

**North America**

* 1+1 Scientist Per Month
* 2: +1 Scientist
* 3: +2 Scientists
* Bonus: Air and Space

* Canada: +$100/month
* Mexico: +$50/month
* USA: +$180/month

Total North America: $330/month **||** Average Country: $110/month

**South America**

* 1+1 Scientist Per Month
* 2: +1 Scientist
* Bonus: We Have Ways

* Argentina: +$70/month
* Brazil: +$80/month

Total South America: $150/month **||** Average Country: $75/month

I was doing the Alien Base mission and it started badly: triggered two sets of Mutons + Berserker, right? As I moved my Assault LT up to start the fightback, another Berserker popped out of nowhere and critted him for another instakill. 

Things are going... badly. 

What followed was a cagy back and forward with a heavy Sgt

I'm thinking that's got to have broken the back of it, I do the tester move with the support just inside the doorway and my heart sinks. 6 Heavy Floaters and 3 drones ping out of nowhere. I pull everyone back, get the Col nicely set up, I'm looking at the neat little killzone I've created... then the bastards start coming over the top. I didn't even realise it was possible... assumed that if this was a base, this should be a closed room. Well, guess what. 

I'm gritting my teeth as they all move in. I've got 3 HFs in the killzone room, let's see how this pans out (I'm not on Ironman, so at the very least I can go back to the start of the level). 

Well, trying to swamp us.

1) Choose Europe to start so building a workshop will be easier for future satellites.  
2) Research ""Weapon Fragments"".  
3) First mission choose the engineers reward.  
4) After completing mission build a satellite.  
5) Build two scopes when weapon fragments research finishes.  
6) Research ""Beam Weapons"".  
7) Launch satellite over the US to get largest income boost.  
8) Transfer interceptor to North America.

By the time I get to mid April I seem to be fighting in missions I don't have the firepower to escape unscathed. In my last play-through I didn't even get a solider to Corporal because one or two would die every mission.

Anyone have any tips? I'm debating on dropping down to normal but from what I've heard it seems like it would be too easy. I like the challenge but I'd like to actually may it through May and utilize some of the badass research items.

I'm working on a few things to change up in /r/xcom and I would like to open a few for discussion and feedback. I'd also like to get any suggestions from you while we're at it.

Ideas in the works:

* **Overhaul of /r/xcom**
We've been working on a /r/xcom a facelift. We're going to get some art

* **Changes to rules/FAQs**
Currently the only rule being enforced by the Moderators is to have the discussion in /r/xcom focused on XCOM and not be used as an advertising forum for other games. We're going to get a statement up in the sidebar about this.

All content otherwise is accepted but we expect to see a slight rise in traffic and posts with the release of XCOM:UE. If you'd like to ensure that /r/xcom stays away from certain posts

* **Sidebar Changes**
The side bar over there ---&gt;

* **/r/xcom Player Profiles**
One of the initiatives for /r/xcom subscribers is going to be to setup your own ""Rookie"" profile. In your profile, class and set it up for other player's to use in their games.
 
This keeps your partners/wives/husbands/fiances, friends and pets safe from harm and also provides some fun posts for /r/xcom to share with each other. I can't wait to see a Classic Ironman Let's Play made with only members of /r/xcom. Hopefully Limiate goes out in a blaze of glory in your game.

This could very well expand into our own ""Memorial Wall"" based on the memorial wall in the bar in the barracks. We'll see where it goes.

I'm currently trying to find a way to implement this. Currently we're thinking an additional subreddit or a single thread. If you know of another subreddit that does something like this or have an idea

**

In a German forest last night a Ukrainian soldier paid the ultimate toll for the successful X-COM mission code-named Silent Gaze in which an enemy commander was captured from a downed UFO. 

Rk. Tatyana Solovyova was on her first mission with X-COM after several high ranking elite personnel were ruled unavailable due to Psionic Testing and doctor's orders. She had been elevated ahead of more senior personnel on the recommendation by her fellow Ukranian; Col. Tatyana ""Shotsy"" Novikova (Au). 

After approaching the downed stricken enemy craft the squad led by Col. ""Snake Eyes"" Guo (Sn) and consisting of Col. ""Mr Clean"" Klein (Su)

The 2 Ukrainians took point supported by Haddad and Klein with Guo and Liang the sniper team acting as fire support. Intel had indicated strong enemy resistance as they enemy craft seemed largely intact despite the heavy impact it took from the crash. 

Initial enemy resistance consisted of a trio of Heavy Floaters. Combat was initiated by sniper support and with consummate ease and a path cleared to the vessel. Upon gaining eyes on the vessel it was deathly quiet, and a pair of Muton Elites were encountered. 

As the firefight ensued in the interior of the vessel against an entrenched and unfamiliar opponent Col. Guo ordered the forward teams to withdraw to the exterior so that sniper support could provide fire Col. Klein remained undetected inside to provide intel on enemy movements which proved invaluable.

The Elites pressed forward into the waiting sights of Guo and Liang

Reacting to this call was another new threat, however as he had HEAT ammunition this was not too much of an impedance. It still took the combined efforts of the entire squad to take down what X-COM scientists have now dubbed the ""Sectopod"". The drones were then easily dispatched. 

After checking of the interior with battlescanners before proceeding, Haddad were to provide covering for the entry team of Klein, Novikova and Solovyova. 

Expecting to see a single unprepared enemy in disarray they breached to find a well prepared elevated defensive position of 2 Muton Elites guarding the Alien Commander. The Elites had turned the tables on X-COM, an alternative was needed and fast. 

Haddad fired his one remaining missile at the well ensconced position but due to the blast radius and the enclosed interior of the ship

Liang and Guo did not need a second invitation and opened fire at the Elites

Now it was the Aliens turn to exact revenge. The last remaining Elite ignored the nearer danger posed to it and attacked a distant Liang who had counted for many of his kinsmen. The heavy plasma round struck him squarely in the chest

The Alien commander (now code-named Ethereal) then unleashed it's shocking powers on it's assailant Col. Novikova who despite being clad in the resilient titan armour layered with chitin plating

Haddad finished off the gravely wounded Elite and fired upon the Ethereal but somehow he missed

By now Guo had joined Solovyova and closed in on the Ethereal forgoing cover, she was alive but something was not right with her. Rather than fire upon the slender robed figure she fired upon her own squad mates hitting Guo in the flank. 

Realising that the only way of halting the mind controlled Novikova was killing or capturing the Ethereal

Haddad and Guo fired upon it

In Klein's hand the arc thrower shot out an irridescant blue ball at the Ethereal

Novikova collapsed to her knees released from the mind control and wept above Solovyova's body,False,self,t5_2si6x,False,,,t3_171a6z

The centerpiece, a piece covering Firaxis's remake of XCOM. As I read the article, there were some gameplay elements that were either changed or didn't make the cut. I'll list some of the changes below:

* More than one UFO on radar at once. - Correct me if I'm wrong
* Africa consisted of ""cash-poor nations that contribute a smaller amount to XCOM's overall funding - but the continental bonus is a motherload of raw resources that can provide XCOM's engineers with everything they need to keep the organization's armories stocked"" -That's literally exact opposite of Africa in the game today. It also suggests that there were more resources than just spacebucks
* Jake Solomon says, see the same map [twice]"" - Maybe, maybe not. I've certainly seen some of them more than once in a single playthrough, although the variety is supposedly there
* Regarding SHIVs: ""Several different chassis types become available throughout the course of the game"" - There's the base SHIV, so that checks out
* Grenades were REALLY different: ""At the end of the alien turn the XCOM grenade explodes"" - That would have been IMO
* Another big change: ""since he bought it courtesy of a particularly destructive weapon
* Not a change
* On PC and console ports: ""And fear not
* Difficulty levels: ""Finally
* Experience was different: ""Losing a squadmate
* Potential end game: ""It seems likely that the endgame will involve some kind of invasion of XCOM's secret base...but Firaxis stopped short of confirming that despite dropping strong hints"" - Having never played the original XCOM (don't judge me)
* Other miscellany: The combat UI is much different and more noticeable

In February of 2012, but overall, XCOM has been a great game.

Please try it and give some feedback so we can make it work perfectly.",NeverLooksLeft,34,6,15,"I've seen some of you have had the same ""problems"" with XCOM as I have. So I got the Second Wave mod and started playing with the ini files. So far I've modded them into three different mods. One for Marathon and everything but Diminishing Returns and possibly Results Driven on classic+ (Marathon)

For Second Wave to be active you have to have completed the game or at least find someone's savegame for that.

I've made classic+ a lot harder. It's a merge between classic and impossible marked with (classic+) under tactical, or impossible (they should still be playable but I haven't tested it yet). These are the changes:

Tactical gameplay:

• Aliens have as much hp as on impossible (classic+).

• Aliens have classic aim (thin men down 5 aim)

• Slightly more will on ranking up.

• ~150 % xp needed to level up.

• Chryssalid kills have 75 % chance of zombies outside of vision

Strategical gameplay:

• Continentel bonuses tweaked so they're equal (research times on autopsys and interrogations are lowered making South America not completly needed to have a chance).

• Panic levels are tweaked to be more in tone with Marathon.

• Cost of items, officer training, and foundry upgrades tweaked to be in tone with marathon.

I would be very happy to get any and all kinds of feedback so we can tone this to be as perfect as possible.

[And here's the link to the nexusmods](http://xcom.nexusmods.com/mods/40).

Credit to PressureCereal for making me take my time to write this down.

Edit: Added installation guide.

To install the mod all you need to do is extract the .rar anywhere you want and run the modpatcher.exe of the mod you want to install ([each folder is a different mod] you can't have more than one installed since they edit the XComGame.exe), simply delete the XComGame.exe and rename xcom-original.exe to XComGame.exe.

Installing a mod will change any saved games. But if you go back to the original .exe it will be as before. So all that's needed is to swap the two .exe if you want a game with the mod and a game without.

Edit2: v1.01 is out. Found a ""bug"" in the ini files - the continent bonuses are registered inversed. And balanced a few items worth.

The continent bonuses are as following:

• Asia: 40 % discount on OTS and Foundry - it will say 60 % when you choose base location.

• Europe: 60 % discount on Labs and Workshops - it will say 40 % when you choose base location.

• Africa: 20 % higher total income (already worked).

• North America: 70 % discount on interceptors and their equipment - it will say 30 % when you choose base location.

In the rarest of cases, one in which the Council eventually develops a collective conscience, and the events that have taken place over the past year are allowed into the public view, I feel that it is necessary to provide my perspective on, and justifications for

If a Council censor is reading this, for the sake of us all.

###You may not know who I am.
I am ResistTheUrge, a hellfire testament to XCOM's effectiveness, forged in blood and grit. Now, as the Earth rebuilds, you have our actions to thank for your continued survival.

I say this not to inspire awe or terror

###A trusted aide is worth a thousand servants.
If the Aliens had had such a resilient and determined director of operations as [Central Officer Bradford](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=102773486), ready to make the tough decisions when it came to unidentified contacts. Ready to sound the alarms at any time, Bradford was able to push through defeats as easily as victories. I would not have anyone else by my side in this crisis. He was not only a brilliant ally, but a trusted friend. If the Council has any sense, they'll appoint him commander following my absence, and if he has any, he'll decline.

###The darkness of war breeds progress and ingenuity.
This has never been clearer to me than after witnessing the combined strengths of our research and engineering teams. Even though it's been a year since they began their work

[Dr. Vahlen](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=102773435), the Elerium power source, cybernetic implants, hyperwave technology; the list goes on and on. Each and every single member of the research team deserves a Nobel Prize, but today, they go home in obscurity, gold watches and government pensions in hand. They are forbidden, to reveal the secrets they've uncovered in their time at XCOM. What a terrible fate that must be

Down in the workshops, though, and every soldier under my command has him to thank for their lives. Brilliant developments in weapons and armor technology have launched the human war machine hundreds, if not thousands, of years beyond what it was previously capable of. New aerospace platforms, communications systems, and life support matrices promise a new frontier as we colonize other planets.  Advances in artificial intelligence, and energy management have rendered obsolete the problems plaguing industry and economy the world over. We, we have the tireless engineers of XCOM to thank.

###The actions of a few have resonated among many.
Faced with this crisis, and ferocity of only [six men and women](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=102750172), the very best this world has to offer. In addition to engaging the enemy all over the world in a bid for the safety of its citizens, these powerful warriors stood tall against the might of the Alien Temple Ship, prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice for all of mankind. 

###[Colonel Amelie 'Dice' Leroy
Col. Leroy made a name for herself in the very first official XCOM mission, she had little regard for her own safety, often drawing fire away from the other members of her team. She fell to a cunning trap laid by the Ethereals aboard the Alien Temple Ship, but, knowing her, she's smiling down at us for making the bastards pay.
###[Colonel Ernesto 'Arcade' Delgado.](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=102750038) Missions: 39. Confirmed Kills: 53.
Col. Delgado is no man to trifle with. He earned his nickname the first time we came into contact with those damn cyberdisks. After eating a grenade and watching one of his rookie squadmates fall into critical condition, I have no doubt the world would have ended, right then and there. I hear that he's doing security work in Portugal, now. I hope they know how safe they really are.
###[Colonel Maria 'Missionary' Petrova
Col. Petrova was a Lieutenant in the Russian Special Forces before she was transferred under my command. Despite her chosen role of support gunner, all fire and fury. I was hard on her, tried to make her work together with the squad. Hell, I even benched her, sent her to the psi labs for some time off, so she could cool her heels. Boy, did that ever backfire in the most spectacular of ways. She was the first Psionic member of the human race, and she gave her life to save the planet by maneuvering the Alien Temple ship out of the atmosphere
###[Colonel Aya 'Baroness' Rahman.](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=102749986) Missions: 42. Confirmed Kills: 85.
Col. Rahman was our foremost designated marksman at XCOM, she often dispatched twice or three times as many threats as an average soldier might be able to do in the same amount of time, and rarely did her aim fail. I may have commanded Col. Rahman, but the Baroness held dominion over the battlefield.
###[Lieutenant Mamadou 'Fast Lane' Digkale.](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=102749915) Missions: 4. Confirmed Kills: 7.
Lt. Digkale did not see much combat during his tenure at XCOM, he quickly established himself as a foundation for the assault team. He was an invaluable asset as a final line of defense against the Ethereal's psionic attacks. I'm proud to send him home a hero to his native Nigeria, where I hear he has started a school for psionically gifted youngsters. 
###[Colonel Christine 'Shotsy' Fischer.](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=102750103) Missions: 34.^[12] Confirmed Kills: 75.
Col. Fischer joined my team after being discharged from the German military for psychological reasons. Personally, and that little incident was one of CO Bradford's justifications for putting her in an assault position in our squad. 

###A new dawn approaches.
I grow tired remembering the countless operations our organisation has taken part in. Dear citizen of Earth

2. Want to research Blaster Bombs but haven't found an alien Battleship yet?

This even works on Impossible and you will *not* gain too much panic, provided this is late game.

The effects of a few extra points of Will and Aim should not be underestimated, which leads to less firepower during your next turn, which may lead to a death, and so on. But if you didn't miss that shot, or the soldier didn't panic, a team wipe could be a victorious mission instead.

My first encounter with Chrysalids: Mission is on an interior map, four ranked up to Lt, two snipers, a heavy and an assault, and a Squaddie Support. Everyone is still using regular guns except the Support has a laser rifle and the snipers have laser pistols. Heavy is down to 1 hp after taking a hit to the face by one of the first group of Chrysalids at the start of the mission. Squaddie Support is down to 4 hp but has used his medpack. Everyone else is doing alright but I'm having trouble using the snipers effectively indoors.

Anyway, both go down. My snipers and heavy then proceed to finish off the chrysalids but when the zombies rise and get within range of my men it seems to signal 2 other packs of Chrysalids (is this a real thing?). Know at this moment I'm doomed. Finished off the zombie, kill 2 chrysalid but then one of my snipers go down and my heavy gets cornered, literally with 3 chrysalid adjacent to him but not able to attack that turn. I think about it for a second and know its time to suicide rocket the pack. The rocket kills the heavy, kills a chrysalid and blows up a nearby object bringing the 2 remaining chrysalid down to 1 hp. Remaining sniper tries to distance himself and then takes a shot with his pistol and kills the second last chrysalid. Unfortunately he didnt get far enough away from the other one and it trots up and impales his ass.

Lessons learned from my first wipe:
 
* You don't have to do every mission right away (could tell it was going to be a hard one from the start)
* Bullets vs Chrysalids = fail
* Bring more grenades (all my guys had scopes except the support with his medkit). 
* [When it starts to fall apart

Instantly decided it was time to get serious and restarted on Classic Ironman mode

My first 20 or so attempts, didn't use overwatch enough, didn't plan properly etc.). The next 10 tries I usually got to month 3 then flamed out due to a combination of game-breaking bugs (especially teleporting aliens), mistakes, and just plain back luck. The last 10 tries failed almost entirely because of game-breaking bugs and bad luck.




I finally beat the game tonight on my 40th try! Here's what I learned:




**modern_quill's advice in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/11j7az/as_promised_ironman_impossible_strategy_discussion/) is just as helpful on Classic as Impossible.** 
Starting in South America and focusing on research credits made all the difference for me the last 5 tries. I did modify his plan slightly to include a sniper on my team




**Hover shivs (almost) balance out the game-breaking bugs.** Can't stress this enough. In the latter half of the game, but I had stupidly dismissed them because I hadn't found the regular ground (alloy) shivs very useful.




**Ghost Armor is your friend.** Your best friend. At least if you're impatient and prone to making stupid errors occasionally that can only be salvaged with a well-timed ""See ya!""




**It's better not to assault the alien base until you've stockpiled resources, but I wasn't taking any chances this time. Plus it gave me more opportunities to experiment with different combat techniques. Others prefer to assault the base early, but with my luck, I was afraid to. :)

Would be interested to know what memorable triumphs other people made when they were faced with a sudden 'Oh shit!' moment on a mission. When did you turn a crisis into a fistpumping victory? 


Background info: Third attempt at classic ironman. I always focus too much on satelites and not enough on other important things in base so I have carapace armor, just into the 3rd month.

Decided to get an acheivement I noticed, Captain Pavlova (my only high ranked heavy who's been the linchpin of my main squad) and Lt Kojima (my only sniper in the whole game... got 5 supports though). Then I added my only female support, squaddie rank, and a female rookie and set off for a Large UFO crash site.


As I'm reaching the ship I've come across no enemies yet and I started to get the usual sound projections letting me know where things are and occasionally even a noise distinct enough to know what the enemy type is. Uh oh.. I know that particular noise...this map has crysallids


After taking out the energy guy in the first major room, using short moves, overwatching and battle scanners, setting everyone up in good positions before ever opening a screen door. I reach a large door and fully expect the crysallids to be inside what I know is a large long room with a ramp on the other side of the door. I set my heavy up on one side of the door, my rookie on the other side, my support way off down at the other end of the wall because a few steps around the corner is a balcony for a good vantage point next turn, and my sniper stood dead centre but away from the door for as much vision as possible to snipe next turn.


I'm expecting (or hoping) that when I open this door, headshot and a little damage from the other two. Hopefully they will still be far enough away in this long room that if I fail to finish them in one turn, they wont be able to reach my guys in their first move for a kill and have to dash to catch up. I open the door and holy shit there's 3 of them right inside the doorway. They all rush out on their free move and all stand adjacent to my Capt Heavy, ready to kill and implant her next turn. I had no idea what to do... with this squad and gear I don't think I have the damage to take them all out in 1 turn unless I manage to get solid crits from my sniper and heavy. I can't even move my sniper or heavy if I want to do as much damage as possible because I wouldn't be able to use the sniper rifle, and I wouldn't get to use bullet swarm. Maybe I can take two of them out but I'll still lose my best soldier on the enemy turn to the remaining one. I considered trying to run with my 2 high ranked soldiers and leave the others behind as fodder but those 2 left behind wouldn't be able to kill one of them without crits and I'd still be left with 3 crysallids anyways who will run down my fleeing troops with their superior moves per turn. What to do... what to do...? The answer came to me eventually, quite a simple answer infact that hadn't occured to me because I've never done anything like it before in Xcom.


Captain Ludmilla Pavlova, hero of the hour.... took out her rocket launcher and shot it at her own feet, decimating the crysallids health down to 2 points each and punishing their stupidity in gathering so close around a single target. Our fresh faced rookie, inspired by the Captain, took out her single frag grenade and, with a thousand apologies, tossed it at the Captain's feet as well. Three dead crysallids, and the mission victory screen appears. Felt so good. Just to top it all off

Overall:  A good remake of the original.  The little cutscenes were very nice and the game maintained a level of action throughout.  I did like the limitation to the squad at 6.  In the old game

Also

Downsides:  That really annoying problem with different elevations and how they are viewed.  The lack of flexibility in what a given troop could do was also annoying.  Also

I will say that I did enjoy the final scrap.  It came down to 1 guy getting in behind the boss alien with a shotgun.  KABOOM!  Welcome to Earth.

I've just finished the game on classic (not IM though) and have a question regarding the sniper class.

I've equipped my sniper wih grappel armor and had the DGG perk

On most maps I found that grappling onto rooftops either limits my vision (as most enemies will be inside the buildings) or leaves my guy with no cover - essentially a sitting duck. 

On forest missions, save for roofs of some of the UFOs (which again feels useless as most aliens are inside).

I tried archaengel armor

So.. What's up with that?",self,t5_2si6x,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/124cky/damn_good_ground_is_it_worth_it/
