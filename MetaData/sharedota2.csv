EDIT: The purpose of this giveaway is so that I can have more people to play dota2 with.

EDIT2: Since I am not liking what I am seeing so far, then you wont be a candidate for receiving the key and this giveaway basically will reach conclusion. I have yet to decide how I will sort out the 5 people. I am quite busy for the next 3-4 days so I will probably decide around 4-5 days from now which of those 5 will get the key. I also apologize for this long process, but I have given beta keys to a few people now and they dont play anymore (i know right?) SO with fury, I will make this a long process.


**EDIT3**: I have begun to send out PM's to people that I am interested in to get more information. I am checking on this thread whenever I can, you will notice that I gave you a throwaway email to contact me with. I highly suggest that you also create a throwaway email to contact me with, as this will be the preferred mode of communication.

 I also request that you tailor your responses so you can sell your self as the best person to play dota2 with.


*about myself; I have played the moba/ARTS genre for about 6-7 years. Before Dota-Allstars released Ancient Apparition I have already moved on to HoN and played that on and off until I received multiple beta keys (I was very lucky) on November. I am inspired by Na'Vi's play style  and also how composed FIRE is. I played casually almost the entire time

**UPDATE 2:** Got one more extra guest invite donated from another friend.  So **five** winners will be chosen.  I'm reviewing the responses now.

**UPDATE 3:** Here are the results so far.  48 total requests.  23 eliminated with zero prior attempts or did not post permalinks as requested.  12 more were eliminated with only one prior request.  Sorry but I'd really like the keys to go to those who've been trying for a while to get one.  I am reviewing the final 13 submissions.  Prior attempts is the key factor

So yesterday I checked my email and behold!  [Picture](http://imgur.com/QbKue)

Now as to why I don't deserve it? I did the survey less then 4 days ago and lied on all my answers. I figure if I put the highest answer for each category I'll be in the smaller pro section rather then the super large average section and be more likely to be picked. Whether that was the case or not I do not know

But you don't care, you can't enter the giveaway. If you post up your full steam ID not linked through either word, I'll consider your submission forfeit.

The answers were as such!

1.) Phantom Lancer- With his ability to replicate

2.) Maverick the Gambler- A mostly conceptual hero that shared the model of Rubick

3.) Tauren Chieftain's "" Axe of the Chieftain""- Adds 300 Strength and has an active skill called Chieftain Strike (Massive pushback!) The trick was the fact that ""4 items"" were required to summon him (The four totems) and that ""Creatures of the creator"" (The icefrogs needed to get rid of chieftains invulnerability) needed to be used!

4.)Storm Spirit- Though razor was also re-worked

5.) Aghnahims Scepter- Originally only made for a few select intelligence heroes

Hello ladies and gents, one has been accounted for. However, please indulge me in this little riddle game I have set up for the chance to win! Note that this isn't some absurd riddle like the playdota ones, I have neither the time nor patience to contribute something THAT elaborate.

The first person to PM me with ALL of the answers shall win the prize

*Dons riddler cane and hat*

1.) A long a dreary fight it has been, the shop has burned down, so we have no items.
We have all attained maximum power, this nefarious villain attacks more often than all the other. Who is it I wonder, do you know?

2.) Rubick has a twin brother don't you know

3.)There was once a creature of immeasurable power, our heroes were quick to learn his power was too great to be conquered alone. But in a twist of fate, the creatures of the creator were brought forth, weaking the great warrior, allowing for his defeat. The question remains however, that a great item was dropped by the warrior, told to give immense power to its wielder. No one knows what this item is called

4.) The chaotic storm used to be greatly different than the one we know today. Though two of his abilities retained the same name

5.) Eons ago, only certain very specific heroes ever needed it to flourish. Nowadays its price is a shadow of its former self, what was this great weapons name? And what were the insanely expensive components to make it?

&gt;silencer

Okay so here is the game to win the key:
1) Guess a number and a dota2 hero (below) closest number wins
2) Only upvote people
3) Do not make multiple posts they will not be considered

Hints:
Choose a [Dota 2 Hero](http://www.dota-two.com/dota2-heroes) take the letters in the name (excluding spaces if necessary) and take the factorial of it. The number you get and multiply by my favorite number (1 through 100) and type the name of the hero you used.
&gt; Example:
&gt; Chen (four letters) so 4! or 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 (you can use a google) =24
&gt; Then multiply by a number (1-100) e.g. 64 so 24*64=1

Answer format would be (i'd like it if you used commas)
&gt; 1

Conditions of Winning:
1) You do not spam
2) Your account is active-ish (my discretion not yours)
3) Follows the rules of reddit and this subreddit

External Information:
1) The only reason I ask that you provide a hero in addition is because I actually have 2 steam accounts with dota 2 and if you guess the hero right i will give you the 2nd dota2 only account (cheers) and if you just get the number portion right you will just be able to use the account until I no longer see fit (could be 5 seconds or 7 eternities).

- **TASK &amp; RULES** - For each hero of Dota 2, you are allowed to use ANY SINGLE hero (for example an infinite strength Pudge).

*NOTE: BLADE MAIL IS NOT ALLOWED IN YOUR SOLUTIONS* (as it would allow any hero to do infinite damage by reflecting for example the attack of an infinite strength Pudge)

*PATCH: Dota 2 running the content from patch 6.75b (http://www.playdota.com/changelogs/6.75b) -- patch 6.76 is not implemented in Dota 2 yet!*

*In case any hero has multiple ways of doing infinite damage in theory

- **HOW TO ANSWER THE QUIZ** - In ONE post in this thread

e. g. *Ursa*: Stacking up an indefinite amount of Fury Swipes attacks on an infinite strength Pudge.

*Shadow Demon*: A single attack from the Disruption illusion of an infinite strength Pudge.

Congratulations and thanks for the awesome idea.

The final DotA 2 invite contest will be as follows:

&gt;People will post ""I want a Dota Key"" somewhere in the real world. This will be on like a little piece of paper and people will take pictures of where they decided to place the paper. The one with the best or most creative picture with ""I want a Dota Key"" wins. For example

Judging will be held approximately a week from tomorrow so you have plenty of time to brush up on those photography skills. I don't care if you are in the picture or not, extreme, clever, or otherwise outrageous spot. Be sure to capture as much in the surroundings in the photograph so I can get a good estimate of where you are (eg. a brick wall 1,000 feet in the air looks the same as a brick wall 5 feet in the air at point blank range.)

EDIT: Meant to add **NO PHOTOSHOP**. If I can tell you've photo shopped your picture inj any way I will disqualify you from the contest.

1342215867.0,wir9x,Someone asked for a cryptography challenge for a Dota 2 key. So here we go.,T3ppic,7,0,109,"The challenge is for one key. 

Instructions:

1. this is the file holding the data:
http://imgur.com/hsa2l

2. There is a *.txt file hidden in the image (google should tell you how to decrypt that). The password to decrypt the image file is the 8th word of the first paragraph of a wikipedia page (hint hint).

3. Inside the text file there is an encryption hash (very common

4. Time limit is 48 hours. If nobody gets it then both this key and the other one I have will be regifted. 

5. Have fun. 

It really isn't hard. I was toying with something actually brute forceable and not just follow the breadcrumbs. 

1st warning: Attempting to reset my reddit password

2nd Warning: Y halo thar 10.215.206.177. Managed to reset before I got my BackTrack VM up and running. Last warning. Its not fair that you are spoiling it for other people. All the information you need is in this thread. Whilst social engineering is novel and at least shows you are thinking its not cool. Also think when was the last time you saw a password reset form that actually told you the email address of the place it was sending the request?

Edit: This... this is getting complex. Keys are still available. Everything you need up to and including decoding the email address is available in the thread below. One person has at least got to the final decryption stage but has not submitted an entry. You are making this far more difficult than it needs to be (considering I spelt out the process). Thank you for stopping the password reset attempts. 

Double Edit: If I was going to try an crack, I would use John the Ripper. And I would supply it with some characters, for example athotmaildotcom. Some kind of dictionary attack based on T3ppic would be cool. Like Teppic or T3pp1c or some mixture of Teppic and my country of origin like someone managed to social engineer (British or lowercase abbreviated synonym there of). 

Honestly now guys that last edit practically gave you the answer. ********athotmaildotcom 8031810176 possible hashes which for even the slowest computer is about 10 seconds of work. And you know how to narrow the list down. 

Triple Edit: To make it fair Krayons gets the 2nd key because he managed to get from start to finish and got stuck due to a slow computer. So Krayons if you still want a key PM me your email.  For everyone else one more key is still available.

I don't know if you can tell where I'm from but I'm from the poor part of town. You see
Since that happened
I'm not too keen on how the internet works but this ""internet cafe"" lets me plug in my computer and log into reddit. I've learned about this Dota 2 game from being here and I told the guy who runs the place how much I really want a key. He said that he doesn't have any

Anyone found too illiterate to read the rules before hitting enter will be flogged.

Here is some advice from ElusiveByte:
&gt;This thread was created as a place for people who want to offer services, ~~TF2 items~~, etc. in exchange for a key. You may not offer money for a key, or anything that can easily be purchased by anyone, like Steam games. You may not offer anything illegal. Offering invites to private torrent sites will likely be prohibited.
While giving money for a key is not allowed
Basically
Try to think before you make an offer: Does anyone really want what you are offering? Don't post silly things unless you really think someone might trade a key for it. If you do post something dumb

Edit: YOU DO NOT POST SIMPLE REQUESTS FOR KEYS HERE!

As per my last thread

Long story short, as well as the two guest passes. So first I will find a winner for the steam account, create their desired account, activate the dota 2 key, give away the two guest invites, and then give the winner their new steam account with dota 2 (meaning it might be 2 days or so before you get the account).

As with the previous thread, and willingness to improve your mad skillz (I don't really mind if you are terrible so long as you will let me teach you!)

Also anyone who applied in the previous thread is welcome to post again in this one! I have looked over the old thread and there are a few people I had in mind but I don't know if they have gotten keys in the meantime.
So if you would like to apply

*  Your current steam account :

*  Your desired steam account name :

*  Why I should want to play with you

Thanks:D


EDIT: 2/3 keys have been given away now (with the third probably going very soon).  Thanks to everyone for writing in - I really am sorry I don't have a key for everyone.  As before

There will be some changes made to the milestone brackets. This is to allow for quicker beta key giveaways so that people can enjoy the game sooner =) The new brackets and corresponding number of beta keys given away are:

88 Followers (Winner: @LIkonen
138 Followers (Winner: @RobertLif
188 Followers (Winners: @rowanstruwig, 23 April 2012)
225 Followers (2 Winners)
250 Followers (2 Winners)

For 188, we will now have two winners which means to say that two random numbers will be generated for each of these rounds. This doubles everyone’s chances of winning a key in each round. As usual, the upper limits on the numbers generated will correspond to the milestone for that bracket and all other rules apply.

DOTA 2 Beta Key Giveaway:
Step 1: Make sure you have a Twitter account. If you don’t

Hey

A couple months ago I went crazy to get my hands on a beta key

Last night I got 4 keys out of 7.
The one I'm giving to my friend.

So I have 2 keys

So... No competition
(1 each)

And that will be it.

1326382836.0,odzm6,I have a key to give away - just guess a number! Closest wins.,farful,7,4,207,"I have a key to give away; thus

**Find x

Example 1: If I got my invite 3 years ago and played  ~100 games of dota2beta. Then the answer is around 1000. (1095-100 = 995)

Example 2: If I got my invite a month ago and played 34 games a day since

I'll put a comment under whoever is closest to x on Friday night.

Edit: per tgftw's suggestion, and the idea of giving it to someone who has only made comments on r/sharedota2 does not appeal to me. Sorry I keep changing the rules. Yes, I'm a meanie and a dictator. Also it has to be for yourself, not a friend.

Another edit: changed it to ""day i got my invite"" as opposed to ""first day i played"" or ""day i installed it"" to be more specific since all three days are actually different and I know the invite date from my e-mail history.

**tl;dr Guess an integer. I'll pseudo-randomly assign a winner.**

***********

**Final Edit:** Time to announce results and explain my choice in the pseudo-arbitrary winner. I received my beta invite on 3/3/11. Today is 1/13/12. So

Closest guesser is [Animasitas](http://www.reddit.com/user/Animasitas) with 300.

Next closest is [derkunde](http://www.reddit.com/user/derkunde) with 279.

I did not consider either of them very active Redditors.

Next up is [mitsuhiko](http://www.reddit.com/user/mitsuhiko) with 275.

According to his comment history

&gt;You have twelve silver orbs. You know that one is fake. The only thing that distinguishes the fake orb from the real orbs is that its weight is imperceptibly different. You have a perfectly balanced scale. The scale only tells you which side weighs more than the other side.

&gt;What is the smallest number of times you must use the scale in order to always find the fake orb?

&gt;Use only the twelve orbs themselves and no others, no pencil marks on the scale. etc.

&gt;For clarification

&gt;Presume the worst case scenario

Good luck!

Basically, if you've already won a key, let someone else get one. xP

The people who guess the number (+2/-2 , if you guessed 34 or 38, you'd win.) first, wins the key. You can post for all three keys, but if you post on one key, wait thirty minutes to post again for another.
