[Today's Update](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xvsvy/update_2_did_i_just_shittest_my_boyfriend/)

----------------------

**Summary of the Original Post**

The OP, accusing him of lying about his feelings, and then getting angry because he wasn't really enthused about her fake proposal. 

The response was [overwhelmingly against the OP](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xpz2j/did_i_just_shittest_my_boyfriend/c5okjzl)

Instead of accepting blame for her poor decision, /u/possiblyhysterical tears OP a new one by telling her that her first divorce [""is not surprising at all considering your responses here."" ](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xpz2j/did_i_just_shittest_my_boyfriend/c5oo7f4)

OP also asserts that [her boyfriend won't have the spine to break up with her over this mistake](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xpz2j/did_i_just_shittest_my_boyfriend/c5oqjg1).

**Which brings us to the first update...**

Now the real drama juice starts flowing!

OP says that she apologized to her boyfriend for the shit test, and he responded by slapping and punching himself in the face until his eyes were swollen. Wat?

OP goes on to write about her boyfriend's relationship history in detail and includes an anecdote about finding an incest play that he had written about himself getting molested. 

The commentors again rip on OP

/u/mingau123 joins in the dog pile by sympathizing with OP's self-harming boyfriend[and telling OP that she sucks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xsrgg/udate_did_i_just_shittest_my_boyfriend/c5pbz49)

Meanwhile

&gt;Oops

Finally

A minor argument breaks out in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xsrgg/udate_did_i_just_shittest_my_boyfriend/c5pedv3) when /u/Lady_Tentacles suggests that OP's boyfriend might be crazy

**Now for the latest post**

OP lets everyone know that the boyfriend is due to collect his things today and that her female friend has attempted to let him know that nothing really did happen between the three of them while he was away. OP also expresses a desire to try and win her boyfriend back because ""he's been the best thing that's happened to me in a long
&gt;I hate that I ruined our relationship

/r/relationships is a bit gentler this time around

Elsewhere in the thread, too](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xvsvy/update_2_did_i_just_shittest_my_boyfriend/c5q16jh).

    “Gentlemen! You can't fight in here. This is the Dramaroom!”
    ~ Anon.

#### Dramatis personæ:

* */u/karmanaut* — Antagonist. Prominent redditor. Current top-mod of r/IAmA.
* */u/Shitty_Watercolour* — Foil. A novelty account who paints watercolours frequently.
* *The Tremendous Horde Of Redditors* — Protagonist. Unfettered champions of free-speech and democracy. Driven by baffling credulity

#### Act 1. Wherein karmanaut profits from the death and rebirth of IAmA

*Aug, announces that his creation has been ruined at the hands of The Tremendous Horde, and that he will be [closing the subreddit immediately](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ju5cf/goodbye_iama_it_was_fun_while_it_lasted/). He cites a lack of focus; r/IAmA has become a domain of triviality and fakery. 

The Horde is enraged, who [agrees to hand control of the subreddit over to karmanaut](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/just3/i_am_that_asshole_all_of_you_hate_so_much_32bites/). Karmanaut swears a blood-oath to uphold strict submission guidelines for the good of mankind. Anonymous leaves an [astute premonition](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/just3/i_am_that_asshole_all_of_you_hate_so_much_32bites/c2fan1v?context=1).

&gt; *sockpuppet-sideplot*: A ""[turfwar](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/uifof/recap_karmanaut_and_riama/c4vtqt3)"" breaks out involving [/u/bechus and /u/Azured](http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/cl81x/a_violation_of_trust_and_community_values/c0td6ln), as it was previously thought that karmanaut was [one account controlled by several people](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/d5on3), rather than several accounts controlled by one person.

#### Act 2. “Karmagate” and The Karmanaut Administration.

*Feb, but jimmies are nonetheless rustled. 

In what became known as “Karmagate”, is [removed by karmanaut](http://www.reddit.com/r/violentacrez/comments/pvadf/well_well_well_look_what_we_have_here/). In the fall-out, karmanaut is revealed to be /u/probablyhittingonyou (*see sockpuppet-sideplot*). Sushileaks transcripts [reveal tensions among the IAmA moderators](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/px6rz/sushisushisushi_found_a_second_chat_log_in_this/). Andrewsmith1986 is removed as mod of IAmA, and [makes public his wish that karmanaut step down](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/pxtn8/andrewsmith1986_here_ive_been_getting_some_front/). ToR discuss the [implications of leaks, and of having great power in the hands of few](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/pwle1/no_information_leaves_this_room_is_reddit_in/) ([2](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/og1l1/moderator_statistics_round_2_this_time_down_to/)). 

*Edit: [andrewsmith1986 provides his account of the Karmanaut Administration](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/uifof/recap_karmanaut_and_riama/c4vwkko) up to this point.*

Meanwhile

*Apr, of image-macro fame. His [removal comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s5guk/iam_bad_luck_brian_ama/c4b8m3u) receives record-breaking downvotes. The Horde [regroups in r/AdviceAnimals](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/t0xwa/to_karmanaut_the_moderator_that_killed_the_bad/), having aquired the [taste for blood](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/t0xwa/to_karmanaut_the_moderator_that_killed_the_bad/c4iodvx). It is [quietly revealed](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/tdl1a/iam_bad_luck_brian_ama/c4lpt8l?context=2) that the IAmA was a hoax.

#### Act 3. Wherein drama occurs which has been elaborated upon elsewhere to great extent.

*June

The feckless novelty cum People's Champion [responds to his fans](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ugzsl/is_there_anything_an_ordinary_reddit_user_can_do/c4vbvpc). The Horde explodes everywhere, and [three](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/uhbx7/shitty_watercolour_vs_karmanaut_round_3_s_w/).

Drunken_Economist [reverses the ban](http://www.reddit.com/r/Shitty_Watercolour/comments/uh9n3/you_have_been_unbanned_from_iama/c4vczzo) after bearing many [capricious accusations of being karmanaut](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/uhdbg/bi0ware_cites_proof_that_karmanaut_is_drunken/) (he isn't: [1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Shitty_Watercolour/comments/uh9n3/you_have_been_unbanned_from_iama/c4vdmg4?context=3), and then un-removed shortly after.

Karmanaut lies low...
 
&gt; *sockpuppet-sideplot*: Any deviation from moderator-blood-lust is now recognised by The Horde as an admission of guilt and collusion. Karmanaut's confirmed sockpuppets now include [Drunken_Economist](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/uh68e/shitty_watercolour_vs_karmanaut_round_2_drama/c4vchb3), ThePieOfSauron](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/uh68e/shitty_watercolour_vs_karmanaut_round_2_drama/c4vk98u), [ANNOYING_ALLCAPS_ASS](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/sjt0e/video_of_a_6_yr_old_boy_performing_cunnilingus/c4esyc0), [redditnoir](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ugzsl/is_there_anything_an_ordinary_reddit_user_can_do/c4vbvpc), [BritishHobo](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/uh68e/shitty_watercolour_vs_karmanaut_round_2_drama/c4vd15u), [bekeleven](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/uh9qa/butthurt_karmanaut/c4vecdo), [Trapped_In_Reddit, [iaminlovewithjesus](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/uifof/recap_karmanaut_and_riama/c4vwkko)

1334192726.0,s5cwt,MensRights suicide post was real; Reddit subpoenaed in wrongful death suit,,3213,1712,2267,"~~One month ago

~~User /u/sisterofblackvisions has [updated us](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/s59ju/from_the_sister_of_black_visions_who_committed/) with the gruesome tale of his death. She has also informed us that her attorney has brought a wrongful death lawsuit against nine individuals who egged him on

~~Lesson: Drama has consequences.~~

~~**UPDATE** Proof that suicide occurred: [news story](http://tukwila.komonews.com/news/911/728610-man-falls-eighth-story-doubletree-apparent-suicide)

**UPDATE 2** Alright, it's my responsibility to clear some things up. This story is starting to look fishy. Most of the details given by sisterofblackvisions seem to match up with the news story and police ""report"", except for some glaring errors such as the date of the event and the name of the victim. SRS appears to be at most tenuously linked to the specific trolls involved. AlyoshaV's deleted comment was not really encouragement for the event, and for calling him/her out, I apologize.

I want to go on the record and state that, and whoever thought it would be a good idea to troll a guy who posted about his suicidal intentions are the lowest of the low. That doesn't excuse my lack of skepticism and fact-checking.

I've had to deal with suicide in my family before, and while I've partially succeeded, it appears that I stirred up an SRS witchhunt of epic proportions. I don't really have strong feelings for or against SRS, but they don't deserve to be associated with this story.

I'm not going to be reporting drama here anymore. Thanks for those who are showing support and denouncing Internet bullying.

**UPDATE 3** The piece of shit known as /u/sisterofblackvisions has [claimed responsibility](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/s7yjj/i_have_outdone_the_spermjacker_troll_i_am_the/) for trolling the Reddit community.

Meanwhile OP of the original post is gloating like a child and demanding the adoration of his fellow conclusion-jumpers and the apology of his critics:

[http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1cn7ax/recently_missing_brown_university_student_sunil/c9idcb7](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1cn7ax/recently_missing_brown_university_student_sunil/c9idcb7)

All this comes after Reddit had already falsely identified another suspect on the basis that he was brown whilst attending a marathon:

**tl;dr: VA was doxxed in real life and Adrian Chen was going to run an article on him**

The long version is this. A few days ago

I asked him how could anyone have his real picture

[Screenshot 1 of PM Conversation](http://i.imgur.com/0UoxR.png)

He was obviously quite worried about it and

[Screenshot 2](http://i.imgur.com/q1gvo.png)

I then asked if demodding him from /r/Creepshots would stop the article being published:

[Screenshot 3](http://i.imgur.com/L7n0s.png)

At that point, so I am not sure what has changed. I hope they will leave him alone though.

So that is the real story behind Violentacrez deleting his account.

Edit: Here is further proof that Adrian Chen was contacting other Redditors for information about VA:

[Screenshot 4 with /u/Saydrah](http://i.imgur.com/UqRA8.png) 

**Some additional information about Adrian Chen:**

As some people are pointing out, Adrian Chen, seemingly, pretended he was going to end his life.

Over a year ago, who said he was ending his life because of illness, and which gained Reddit a lot of attention on other mainstream news sites:

[51 Hours to Live](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fy6yz/51_hours_left_to_live/)

The truth of the story, shortly afterwards, Adrian Chen claimed to be lucidending himself [Screenshot of his Tweet](http://i.imgur.com/SZqRD.png). All to prove some kind of point about Reddit and gullibility and blah, blah, blah...

When Reddit, [he rapidly backtracked and denied it was him](http://gawker.com/5780681/why-the-internet-thinks-i-faked-having-cancer-on-a-message-board) and also posted this picture of himself that was intended to mock Reddit: http://i.imgur.com/bQlgI.jpg",,False,self,t5_2ss5b,1349861052.0,,

**Chapter 4: ""Noah is a bastard""**

Evidently a week after the other posts, did they eventually expect their men to leave their wives. He explains that he can't leave his wife, and asks that women who have a problem with his affair to ""please just avoid responding.""

**The Comments**

/u/Zara02 has the top comment

&gt;Asshole. Just my 2c.

to which NAR quotes the part of the OP requesting that dissenters keep quiet. /u/sunnydaisy responds with a link to the First Amendment and Zara02  explains that she has a ""moral problem with it.""

/u/DaisyLayz tells OP that of course she would expect him to leave his wife eventually

&gt;This is a really dumb idea though. And I mean that in the most respectful way possible. It's so so dumb and it'll probably be something you regret for a long time. Good luck and I hope it all works out.

/u/HillTopTerrace also responds to the OP

&gt;its quite complicated and not as simple as

&gt;I don't want this to go on for years. I realize its not sustainable. How long do you think we can make it work for before someone gets hurt or she expects more? I've been really good to her so far and I think she is really into me. 

HillTopTerrace continues to humor NAR, but he fatefully counters: 

&gt;I think I will talk to her about my wife... in time. Its literally only been a week. We've had sex once and hooked up one other time. Not soon enough to start talk about my wife. I'm thinking if at the end of the month we are still at it I'll bring up my wife and how this can't last. No need to screw up the new relationship energy now. 

-----------------------------------------

**Chapter 5: ""Its been a lot of fun.""**

Just 2 days later, he reveals that he and Emma have now had sex twice, and that ""it's been a lot of fun."" He boasts that /r/adultery has given him good advice on how not to get caught, and then reiterates that he doesn't want to leave or divorce his wife. As expected, he is heavily downvoted at 0 pts (2+:10-). 

**The Comments**

This time, who recounts her time as a mistress to a man who went through a ""fake marriage"" with her. As for OP's advice, she writes:

&gt;My advice to you should probably be to go fuck yourself

&gt;""its an extremely complex situation. Please don't lecture me.""

&gt;Morality is only complex to immoral people

&gt;(Oh and I do have some practical advice that could save you a lot of money, but you don't deserve it.)

/u/dratthecookies also gives OP advice

&gt;The most problems I've seen (outside of the obvious) came from the guy trying to treat the woman like a piece of crap so she wouldn't like him too much. Or trying so hard not to ""hurt her feelings"" that he ended up over thinking it and sabotaged the relationship. If you both know what you're about and handle it maturely (20 y/o? ehhh) it can be fun.

---------------------------------------------

**Chapter 6: ""She loves me after 3 weeks. How do I end this?""**

A little over 2 weeks later

In his post, which he has previously written off as hopeless,  stating

&gt;I think the marriage is fixable and once I end the affair I will focus on making it up to her. 

He worriedly notes that Emma could ""really... screw me over by going to my wife"" and saying the he doesn't want to hurt her feelings because she's ""a wonderful person who I do have feelings for.""

**The Comments**

The top comment is by /u/stephiej17

&gt;Introduce her to your wife.

OP humorlessly responds that he know she's joking but that he can't tell his wife and that he needs ""to make this go away without my wife learning anything.""

/u/BaconBuddy, this time to laugh

&gt;Ha! When you mess around with a chick who would mess around with a married man

NAR gets upset again

&gt;thought this was on advice forum. Not just a place for people to laugh at others misfortune. I fucked up. Okay. I know that now. 

BaconBuddy has no sympathy for him, and BaconBuddy encourages him to at least get an STD test, which NAR agrees to, but then tells him to stop being a ""prick"" and to tell his wife.

It is here where NAR says that he plans on blaming his wife finding out for ending their affair, so we shall never know what BB thought, but that plan will be relevant in the next chapter.

Back in the thread where NAR was complaining about advice

&gt;Yes

As NAR's house of cards collapses around him and he begs for ""better"" advice

&gt;I do feel bad. Its why I'm ending it. Do you honestly think I don't feel guilty? I love my wife. I love my kids. I love my family. I fucked up. I was selfish and greedy and weak. I'm going to make it up to my wife. Anything she wants she is going to get. I'm going to be the best husband I possibly could be.

stephiej17 tells him to expect Emma to tell his wife and asks if he did it to get the divorce that he wife threatened him with

&gt;disappointed in our marriage

As he blubbers like a child caught with his hand in the cookie jar, and NAR simply replies

&gt;It didn't go well. I don't know what I've got myself into. 

Elsewhere in the thread

**Chapter 7: ""I feel like the unluckiest cheater in the world""**

NAR posted his final and latest update just last night

Here

&gt;I debated posting an update or not since the reception I've had on this sub has been icy

&gt;I feel like the unluckiest cheater in the world. Everything that can go wrong

&gt;Asked for advice about a week or so ago. I tried to break up with Emma. I told her my wife was getting suspicious and we both deserved better. I told her she was an awesome girl and deserved to have someone all for herself. Her response. I'll wait for you. I love you more than I know possible.... Its not even been a month of us being ""together"".

&gt;I ended things with her and she kept texting me and asking me to talk to her. I met up with her on Friday to have a closure type deal. I'm a horny idiot. I banged her the back of my Jeep. Which sent the wrong, Sun, Mon, or Tues. Yesterday she begs me to talk to her so I go to her place. We end up talking way longer than we should and some things go down.

&gt;I just wish she would leave me alone. She is clingy and needy and honestly pretty fucking crazy. Not what I signed up for. I'm like dying under the stress and drama. I have a hormonal

**The Comments**

/u/justicefails holds the top spot

&gt;I'm asking for sympathy for getting too far into this. I obviously own the decision to cheat. It was my choice.

&gt;My wife may or may not deserve better. I don't automatically the worst husband ever because I cheated one time. She doesn't become a martyr because of my actions. You know? She still has her faults. I should not have cheated on her though.

/u/TacoCatastrophe rhetorically asks OP what is wrong with him, claiming that he is leaving her alone but that she keeps bothering him, but /u/lemonadegame simply quotes the line in NAR's OP  about fucking Emma in his Jeep and asks ""WTF dude"".

Elsewhere in the thread

&gt;Perhaps through some miracle this blows over?

He also admits to doing the exact opposite of the given advice in the last thread

&gt;Its difficult in the moment because Emma is fucking attractive as hell and I'm an indecisive

I've been getting a flood of PMs asking me to update, and so here's part 3 to ""A Cheater's Tale."" 

----------------------------------------------------------------

**Chapter 8: “I'm a piece of shit.”**

We last heard from Noah/NAR (33, his 20 year-old mistress, wouldn’t stop contacting him after he tried to break up with her and he yet again “banged her in [his] jeep.”

For several more weeks Noah went about as he always had: [complaining about his wife](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11g4vc/married_women_of_reddit_how_is_your_sex_life/c6m6yw0?context=3) and claiming that [he didn’t want to leave his wife](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11gikc/i_see_a_lot_of_stuff_on_reddit_that_talks_about/c6mbbqk)

&gt;I do not want to have sex with random women

He also went on to call Emma “fucking crazy” for [giving him head on their first “date”](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/11h9ns/what_do_you_think_when_a_girl_you_just_met_gives/c6mgfaz?context=3).

Interspersed with his newfound sage anti-cheating advice, he placed all of the blame for his affair on his wife, his horniness, and Emma’s craziness. He even admits:

&gt;I do get some sort of high off knowing she wants me and maybe I'm afraid to just abandon that. This has honestly been one of the most challenging ordeals of my life. 

He goes on to express hope that he can be friends with Emma, interspersed with his replies are a [bunch](http://www.reddit.com/r/gonewild/comments/11in0m/this_is_just_who_i_am_f/c6mu56e) of [random](http://www.reddit.com/r/gonewild/comments/11htp8/fuck/c6mlqc1?context=3) come-ons to Gonewild girls. 

On October 15, he again blames his pregnant wife’s lacking sex drive on his affair, saying: 

&gt;If my wife and I were suddenly rocking in the bedroom then what I get from Emma isn't needed. If the sexual aspects were fixed and my wife was more emotionally affectionate


The next day, confessing:

&gt;I fucked up. I talked to Emma again...

&gt;Not for a long time but still too long. I just asked her how she was feeling and we caught up. I asked her if she really fucked someone else and she admitted she didn't 

&gt;I'm not strong enough to end this. I think I need it. I need her. It doesn't mean I don't love my wife or I don't care about my wife or my family. Its just on the side. It doesn't take anything away from them...

Predictably

He then makes his last comment in his relationships post

&gt;Right now I don't want to think about my marriage or what could potentially go wrong with Emma. I just want to live. I want to have fun and fuck the very willing partner I have. We'll just take it day by day. This isn't fair or perfect but its far from the worst thing in the world. 

Noah goes on to flip flop in other subreddits between being [afraid of being caught](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/11jkeh/being_a_sex_positive_person_im_disgusted_by/c6ngy99) and [hating the idea of being just Emma’s fetish](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/11n969/i_think_i_have_a_fetish_for_having_sex_with/c6o2v6q).  He also (*brace for it*) [**confesses to fucking Emma in his daughter’s bedroom**](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/11mtr7/where_have_you_had_slightly_to_insanely/c6o3cor).

A week later

Finally,"" proving himself to be the same old flip flopping, spineless bastard that he’s appeared to be throughout this whole saga.

By October 29

On November 3rd, though). Here, Noah [admits that he’s planning on deleting](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/12l22m/is_it_okay_for_one_person_to_be_dominant_33m_20f/c6w38uc) this account since no one wants to help him knowing his history, and thinks that his GW comments are harmless. He also says he’s going to cut off the affair before his child is born.
By November 13

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Chapter 9: BigRed79**

On November 3rd, along with his ongoing affair. He, like NAR, [blames his wife’s “trust issues”](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/12ztdq/can_a_marriage_be_better_after_an_affair_33m/c6zlg33) for his affair, complains that [he doesn’t want a divorce](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/12powl/if_your_husbandboyfriendfiance_had_an_affair/c6x56a4), and explains that he’s [fucked his mistress in his car and house](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/12powl/if_your_husbandboyfriendfiance_had_an_affair/c6xbjsb). He also calls Nebraska [his state](http://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/12p2l3/sil_saturday_i_learned_ty_burrell_phil_on_modern/c6xw9j2?context=3), as NAR did, which is identical to NAR’s. Eventually

Under this new account,” to which Noah replies 

&gt; My history is 1 affair. I've not cheated on my wife frequently or regularly. 

&gt;I'm going to confess and end the affair and beg my wife. Hopefully she'll consider taking me back. 

&gt;And I'll *continue* to be a good father. 

Noah also goes on to admit that [if his wife didn’t know about the affair
He makes his last comment in his thread on November 14th

-------------------------------------

**Chapter 10: The Confession**

On November 20th in the “Surviving Infidelity “ forums

This causes Noah to call Emma himself the next day

His wife then stops talking to him for four days

After being berated by other forum members for not making a cleaner cut from Emma

&gt;I didn't ignore everything that was posted about no contact. What ended up happening is I wasn't getting anythign from my wife. She wasn't talking to me

&gt;Maybe it was selfish but I didn't want to be cruel to OW. Especially if it turns out in a month my wife kicks me out and files for divorce. Then where am I? I don't have any clarity over where we are now

&gt;I need help ending the affair. I CAN'T do it myself. I know that. I'm not strong enough. If I could end the affair on my own without my wife's help or encouragement I would have done so. So I do wish she was more involved and active in this. Saying what she needs clearly and asking me to do things for her. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And so ends Noah's dirty dalliance with a 20 year-old bombshell... for now at least.

I jumped the gun.

I don’t know how this account amasses so much karma

Bottom line: by its own admission

Karma is an odd thing. It’s an imaginary or arbitrary reward given to users of the site by users of the site. It is not redeemable for anything and more often than not is the product of chance, it should be obvious even before this took place that it is just here to observe the community and its reaction to various comments – what works, what doesn’t. I’d have to imagine that the person behind the account takes great pleasure in participating and joining in the fun – the absolute last thing on Earth I’d ever want to do is be the catalyst to taking that pleasure away. Least of all instigate a witch hunt.

I humbly ask that we let this one go. Begrudge, expand our minds, and participate in the Reddit community. What that might entail is something completely different to absolutely everyone here.

I feel that I owe an apology to the Reddit moderators and administrators. In the heat of the excitement over the last 24 hours, especially anything targeting the TiR account in a negative way. Please do not target moderators or administrators either. They are looking out for everyone’s best interest and just want to keep peace.

Can we please get back to our normal Reddit viewing positions?

----------------------------------------------------------------
**Chapter One: ""I would never cheat on my wife. Ever.""**
 
It all started with [NoahsArcRises's first post, just a seemingly generic question with the OP asking for the subreddit's sympathy. It was entitled ""*Was I wrong to accept another woman's number? I am married...?*"", and it is here that NoahsArcRises introduces our drama's players:

* NoahsArcRises - 33
* His wife - 32
* Emma - 20

NoahsArcRises, he chats up the beautiful Emma, whom he soon finds out went to his Alma mater and who is ""his type."" His wife returns and jokes about how attractive Emma is, and it is here where NAR swears that

&gt; It was just a nice conversation. I didn't think much of it. I was just being friendly. I had zero plans of anything more. I would never cheat on my wife. Ever. 

As he and his wife are leaving the restaurant, he gets a text from the vivacious Emma, who asks to have coffee with him sometime.

His wife sees the message and starts crying

**The Comments**

The top reply was by /u/slowdrowned

NAR replies and admits that the attention makes him feel great

/u/stephiej17 tries to defend OP

Again, but /u/retrovm retorts that he should've just told her off because he's married. NAR admits that he's ""been kind of unsatisfied about a lot of things and it seemed like, not a big deal at that point."" BaconBuddy skewers him for it, calling him pathetic for ""framing it that way"" and telling him 

&gt;God, you're genuinely confused as to where you went wrong... and it's enough to make me sad.

Elsewhere

&gt;I'm trying to do the right thing here. I think the standard you have (and I guess my wife has) is a bit too strict. At the end of the day I won't fuck anyone else. That should be good enough. I feel like what you are talking about means I can't talk to any other women ever. That is too much. 

/u/boredwillow then tells him that he is either a troll or very selfish

NAR also later reveals that this date night was his attempt at ""try[ing] to improve things"" and in that in regards to this scenario being flipped (wife getting a college guy's number):

&gt;I'd be very surprised if a hot college guy was interested in a heavily pregnant woman. 

The rest of the comments are filled with people calling OP a selfish idiot and telling him to [""punch [him]self in the face""](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/yuxsd/was_i_wrong_to_accept_another_womans_number_i_am/c5z2ru5)

**Chapter 2: ""So I had a first date yesterday with a younger girl. It went well.""**

NAR makes his [second post, with 0 points (20+: 23-).

**The Comments**

/u/SheGivesGreatHelmet has the top comment, noting that NAR's married and that his comment history is ""weird.""

/u/thelostapostle also notices this inconguity

&gt;On the larger scale

_________________________________________________

**Chapter 3: ""First Time Adulterer. Advice/Recommendations?""**

NAR appears again

In his post, kids, and Emma. He admits that 

&gt;I've always had kind of soft boundaries with women. I've flirted with women other than my wife for the last couple years. Gone as far as exchanging numbers and texting a lot but I haven't actually met up with anyone yet. Something finally snapped with me and I just got a point where I don't care anymore. 

He explains that he went out with Emma the day before and again admits to fooling around with her

**The Comments**

/u/throwaway_quinn has the top post

/u/thewingbed tells OP that it's ""a little weird"" that Emma would still be willing to fuck OP after getting his number in front of his wife

&gt;I do have some hesitation over what it says about her judgement. I think its a tradeoff. She doesn't have perfect judgement but she has a great body and a fun personality. I've done the respond to craigslist posts since I'm bored thing before and she is in a different league physically. I don't know. I think it should be okay. I'm just nervous.

**Brief Summary of Background Drama**

For a few months now, has been a source of great controversy on Reddit, and more recently in the mainstream media. A few weeks ago, a high school teacher who posted pictures of “hot” girls in his classes was [caught by a user who recognized the posted girl](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/09/27/georgia-teacher-under-investigation-over-sexualized-creepshot-photos-of-students/). His subsequent arrest gave CreepShots/Reddit mass media publicity. 

[Here’s the SRS post](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/103do2/effort_reddits_voyeur_subreddits_creeping_through/) that documents the teacher’s CreepShots post (/u/weagleweagleweagle) and in the comment section

After the teacher’s arrest, and r/CreepShots submissions started getting inundated with downvotes and new members.

Cries for the sub to be shut down were met by the defense that the sub’s activities were perfectly legal

**violentacrez’s account deletion and doxxing**

Yesterday (10/10/2012)

Since the link to his “goodbye” is a [deletion wasteland]( http://www.reddit.com/r/violentacrez/comments/118a3d/well_guys_my_work_here_has_come_to_an_end/), including VA’s last post at 2:33 GMT:

&gt; 'Well
&gt;3 hours ago by violentacrez from self.violentacrez 

&gt; 'It's been real

For the curious: according to the CodeRedd code, and whether all of the VA users (his account is allegedly shared) agreed on this deletion.

[Here’s](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/118bxy/violentacrez_reddit_pimp_and_source_of_much_drama/) the SRD post about it and linking to the now deleted thread. It is here where /u/ThaddyG almost prophetically wonders whether something happened to VA

&gt;Seems obvious to say but something must have happened to him IRL. Legal trouble?

Just a few hours later, a Gawker writer infamous for being “anti-Reddit”, had doxxed VA after obtaining his personal information from an unknown source, though apparently even VA deleting his account wouldn’t prevent Gawker from running the story on him. PIMA posted pictures of conversations he’s had with VA in his post, including [one of a conversation where Saydrah](http://i.imgur.com/UqRA8.png) discusses Adrien Chen’s approaching her for a comment on a story about VA. 

On a note that may or may not undermine to PIMA’s offered explanation

**PIMA Mourns VA in /r/NSFW**

In a virtually identical post to the his SRD submission, and acknowledging that r/CreepShots has been shut down along with a screenshot of a threatening PM that one of the r/CreepShots mods received (more on this later).  He blames SRS for the blackmail, and muses that it’s “interesting the amount of stuff SRS is allowed to get away with on this site.”
In the comment thread, and call for bans on Gawker.

/u/I_hate_bigotry catches wind of PIMA’s post and makes [this circlebroke post about it]( http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/11a2fp/pimas_revenge_or_how_to_play_the_hivemind/). In it


**SRS Celebrates VA’s Deletion**

[SRS Mod ArchangelleNoodelle makes a self-post bidding VA adieu](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/118i72/meta_im_sure_youll_all_join_me_in_saying_a/), but acknowledges that this is just unfounded speculation.

1355637226.0,14xivv,[Announcement] A new rule to discourage invasion,stopscopiesme,970,329,898,"Note: Skip down to **Here's How it Works** for instructions

Hi everyone. SubredditDrama has grown a lot in the past year
It's gotten to a point where being linked by SRD is damaging the discourse in other subreddits. We moderators hate to see this happen

Voting and commenting in linked threads is completely unacceptable. We're here to watch drama, voting and commenting can and does cause harm to those linked. ""Whatever,"" some users have said. ""They're just meaningless internet points."" Sure, karma is worthless outside of Reddit. However, it still means something. The downvote has been called a ""distributed democratic ban."" When someone is downvoted past the threshold, it buries their discussion. Each subreddit has its own unique culture, and voting is a huge part of that. By voting on linked comments, you don’t need to give them your two cents. And when a linked user gets a half-dozen rude replies from SRDers

Here are a few recent examples of invasion

[A month old thread receives new comments]( http://www.reddit.com/r/MetaLog/comments/14jjml/subredditdrama_pics_is_the_phrase_op_is_a_faggot/)

[Vote flipping in /r/ainbow]( http://www.reddit.com/r/MetaLog/comments/14vz7u/subredditdrama_ainbow_a_man_makes_a_stark/)

If you are reading this, there is still a portion of this userbase that votes and comments in linked threads. To discourage this, we will be implementing a CSS trick called “No Participation.”

**Here’s how it works:**

A subreddit can display a certain stylesheet based on what kind of domain is used. In this case, and voting and commenting will still be possible. This way we can still watch drama as it develops, but if the subreddit wishes to preserve its own culture by discouraging popcorn pissers, they have that option. 

From this point forward, put the “np” in the domain. For example

http://www.reddit.com/r/NoParticipation/comments/10mqi3/how_to_install_noparticipation/

becomes

http://np.reddit.com/r/NoParticipation/comments/10mqi3/how_to_install_noparticipation/

Again, despite the rules, have been voting and commenting.

If your submission links to reddit.com instead of np.reddit.com it will be removed by AutoModerator.

Special thanks to /u/KortoloB for making No Participation

**TL;DR: It’s against the rules to vote and comment in threads linked by SRD. However, your submission will be removed.**

------------------------------------

**Chapter 13: ""She's... so fucking mean""**

The day after Noah compares Emma to Laura, and just being ""fucking mean."" He gushes about how great marriage counseling went, then again complains that he has to ""appease"" Laura because she claimed the marriage counselor was flirting with Noah. 

He even says: 

&gt;I am trying to make it right with her and she just doesn't recognize me trying. I was going to go to Indianapolis for a football game last week

Falling back into his original negative mentality about their reconciliation

As others question what Noah expects from his wife

&gt;I am not exaggerating when I say she either does not talk to me or makes snide remarks. That is it. I thought it was bad before
but **its soul crushing to live with someone who hates you.**  ...

&gt;I've taken all the initiative. I was selfish with my affair

He even references the incident where he compared Laura to Emma

&gt;She takes even simple things I says and twists them. I told her I wanted her to talk ot me more and that is an insult. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Chapter 14: Fallout**

Last Thursday (December 13)

In it

&gt;**can't get myself to a point of being ""over"" the other woman.** I obviously haven't told my wife this, I miss fucking her.** I just miss her so much. I thought she didn't matter to me and I was wrong. I haven't broke our no contact but its been such a test for me. 

&gt;And I'm wavering now. I looked up her twitter and **she has been posting tweets about me and how much she misses me too.** Fuck

He again blames his wife for his wandering mind

Many users chime in with the same advice as the SI forum members

&gt;My wife doesn't know I check up on Emma... oh god that would not go over well.

Then the thread blows up.

First

However, with over 1108 net upvotes (2050:942) and the thread gets flooded with 486 new comments (according to my RES). Soon after, Noah's post gets removed and his posts on both accounts get downvoted *heavily*.  I also got a noticeable increase in upvotes on my last SRD post about Noah, as well as several new comments.

The rest of his comments are re-hashings of the same old excuses as to why he cheated, but it wasn't Noah.]

On December 14th, confusing several members and causing the mod to delete his/her post. 

However, an experience that was ""humiliating"" for her because not only did so many people now know about her marriage, but that Noah had been told repeatedly to stop having the affair but instead ""bragged"" about fucking Emma.

She comments that to her, Laura realizes that ""he thought about it from the start and selfishly chose to cheat anyways.""  Laura goes on to say that his attitude in his posts was ""sickening"" and that she now ""felt like dying."" 

**She writes that she tried to kick him out on Saturday morning, but that he was also still following Emma's Twitter.

Other SI posters do their best to comfort Laura, Laura updates that ""he is gone"" from their home and that she has steeled her resolve to rid herself of this cheater**, calling Noah a ""pathetic loser"" and Emma a ""special type of bitch."" She then sheepishly apologizes for her ""salty language.""

---------------------------------------------------------

**Epilogue**

SI user ProbableIceCream, which detailed a PM that Noah sent had sent him on the SI forums in response to his post. 

Noah writes:

&gt;I don't know you, under an old account was during my affair when my mind wasn't right. It was a mistake.** I'm not proud of my decision to cheat at all, and I've been trying really hard to move beyond that.

&gt;**But thanks to you

&gt;So

---------------------------------------

**And so ends this cheater's tale.**

 Thank you, and a special thank you to those of you who tipped me periodically about Noah's newest posts.

**The r/CreepShots Take Down**

At 3:10 on the same day, the blog was made by a “25 year-old female Redditor”  that they call “Samantha.” I've seen its contents and  it is *very* thorough, including marital statuses, places of work, pictures of the Redditors, and names of family members. 

Shortly after
(I’m fuzzy on the time here since Reddit posts over 24 hours just say “1 day ago”). [Here’s the SRD post on it](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1198zm/rcreepshots_has_been_removed_due_to_doxxing_of/) and [here’s the post’s linked screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/AL52y.png) of a message to /u/CreeperComforts from /u/HelloJK. In it, mods HelloJK, and finally deletes his own account. In the SRD thread, PIMA says that he’s talked to CC and that CC is planning on going to the police to see if “anything can be done” about his blackmailer.

/r/CreepyShots goes up to takes its place, but doesn’t have enough evidence to back his claim up.

/u/iMacHunt also appears in PIMA’s thread

In /r/RedditRequest



**/r/MensRights Fears It’s Being Taken Next**

In a post in SRD, who makes a [SRDBroke post complaing about “fucking moonflower…taking [the sidebar] seriously”](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRDBroke/comments/119cs7/fucking_moonflower_rviolentacrez_implies_that/). 

/r/mensrights mod /u/ignatiusloyola makes a [post about the take-down of /r/CreepShots and /r/violentacrez’s takeover by SRS]( http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/119k8j/rcreepshots_and_rviolentacrez_taken_over_by_srs/),” but is clearly motivated by “power/control.” He accuses SRS of sheltering doxxers, blackmailers, and “the violent” and opposing the “legal right of individuals” before saying that SRS clearly wants to see *1984* come to fruition. 

In his edits
MRAs come out in support for IL, whilst approving of the takedown of CreepShots and VA’s deletion, and saying that “SRS’s little ‘Pandagate’” is a better solution than doxxing.

The MRA community also [begins posting about the doxxing]( http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/119yck/a_small_step_against_doxxing_blackmail_and/)

**Other Mods Get Uncomfortable**

/u/doing_donuts writes in /r/modclub that [he “find[s] this whole situation disconcerting”](http://www.reddit.com/r/modclub/comments/11a2lw/i_find_this_whole_situation_disconcerting/) due to the fact that users of Reddit can break the site’s rules and laws so easily. He wonders if any other mods are going to be the next targets, and notes that
&gt;If Reddit admins do not respond by shutting down [SRS]

/u/Aradon questions where the proof is that SRS is responsible for the CreepShots black mail and PG responds with the HelloJK screenshot

**Who *Is* Behind The Blackmail?**

Despite seemingly almost universal blame to SRS for the CreepShots doxxings and mod blackmail

In /r/ShitRedditSays

Later in /ShitRedditSays

&gt;[Uhh


While it is still unclear who or what groups (if any) are responsible for the CreepShots doxxes


**CreepShots Doxx-ee Allegedly Assaulted**

In his newly created /r/CreepSquad, and asking members of CreepSquad to stay safe.

The top comment by /u/cardance asks PIMA simply

&gt;uh

**An Update Allegedly from violentacrez Himself** 

In /r/mensrights

&gt; 1) Chen did not in any way blackmail me into deleting my account. In fact

&gt;2) ytknows has been a mod on /r/violentacrez for years; when I left, I think it's funny.

&gt;3) I have no idea who gave my PI to Chen. What I said to PIMA about the admins was idle speculation

IL goes on to say that it’s “not clear” whether SRS is involved with CreepShots’ doxxings or blackmail

**Mass Bannings of Gawker Media**

Since the dawn of two months ago,000 comment upvotes) from the Reddit community as a whole. 

His existence has spawned a lot of discussion, but all in all he posted unmolested, and to much upvoted fanfare - even while dodging rumors that [he is andrewsmith1986, Karmanaut, and/or multiple people](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/us8hp/im_fairly_certain_that_as1986_karmanaut_and_tir/) (He posts, *alot*).

Not to say Trapped_in_Reddit was not involved in many dramas, posting constantly, and reaping the karma hassle free (it should be noted that TiR has accumulated many Best Comment awards in his short time with us).

**The Witch Hunt Extravaganza!!**

With his name well known, namely user /u/fumyl. 

18 Jun 2012: User fumyl posted [this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/v6wz7/worst_hunting_dog_ever/c51ycgu?context=1) It was discovered that Trapped_in_Reddit was using [Karmadecay](http://karmadecay.com/) to search for old content as it was reposted to Reddit. TiR would then copy the top comment of the old thread

The gotchya moment was met with an [admittance of guilt](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/v7cmc/til_trapped_in_reddit_games_reddit/c520tpu?context=1)

Needless to say,](http://i.imgur.com/nJcfL.png) and was upvoted to +2700 - while TiR's comment was put out of it's reposted misery at -1900. 

As users became more virulant, furthering the conspiracy that TiR was either friends with a mod, [a mod himself](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/v7cmc/til_trapped_in_reddit_games_reddit/c51zuu8), or [an admin alt](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/v93dl/fumyls_original_post_in_rfunny_exposing_trapped/c52e321). 

While the comment was brought back in /r/funny, and Karmaconspiracy posts remained removed.

In spite of (or due to) the thread removals, Karmanaut, and Andrewsmith1986 began. All of Trapped_in_Reddit's comments were vigorously downvoted, and users [sent him death threats](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/vdhpy/trapped_in_reddit_posts_a_strange_story_of_him/c53o8j3). 

&gt;Reddit is making a joke out of me
 - Trapped_in_Reddit.

**LOL**

To add fuel to the fire

In an attempt to quell the uprising, that ended in the thread being nuked, and the subreddit [changing its rules regarding meta subs as a whole](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/vcu9x/lets_talk_about_drama/). This claim also added *more* fuel to the fire, and increased the hatred of the frenzied mass.


Amidst this pitchforked mass, made a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/v98ju/re_trapped_in_reddit_and_the_past_24_hours/) stating he had completely *jumped the gun*, and TiR had not been *as much of* a karmawhore as we all thought. Even stating:

&gt;Bottom line: by its own admission

Fumyl even went as far as to post his [apology thread in every post he saw about TiR](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/v7f1c/fumyl_figures_out_how_trapped_in_reddit_games/c52famq)

**Oops.**


After discovering the entire witch hunt was a *tad* blown out of proportion, writing a [bizarre story](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vd9ng/what_is_the_one_childhood_secret_you_never_told/c53h4tc) in /r/askreddit featuring rape and incest. This was obviously met with:

&gt;Holy shit you are actually having a mental breakdown.  - thehumantowel

The post also nabbed him the honor of [being on r/worstof](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vd9ng/what_is_the_one_childhood_secret_you_never_told/c53h4tc).

Bathed in infamy, [saying he is no longer going to use the account](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/vdhpy/trapped_in_reddit_posts_a_strange_story_of_him/c53p2jh), and have it go the way of the other numerous, now defunct, novelty accounts.


Even that was met with numerous downvotes.  [**See also**](http://i.imgur.com/ss1EL.png)

In a turn for the hilarious, ""job,"" and that gringos want to kill him.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/vexde/trapped_in_reddit_flees_to_rmexico_and_talks_down/) All of his posts received downvotes below Reddit's default threshold.

* **Update: Modern Era**

After a rather lengthy vacation in Mexico, and Reddit as a whole has forgotten the entire ordeal, [his posts are pretty hit and miss to say the least](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/we4t5/a_scottish_man_gives_nikki_minaj_a_piece_of_his/c5ck0x3).

While Reddit's attention span may have waned, TiR still enjoys regular 500+ comment karma on many of his posts.

Here's the short version of the story:

Girl meets boy. Girl wants boy. Girl can't get boy


[
Here's the post](http://i.imgur.com/dDEx3fh.png) she first posted to /r/ProRevenge

&gt;I was in love with a gay guy, actor, really talented and everything I want in a person), so I couldn't settle to have him as a friend. So I persisted, and it came to the point where I didn't even need him to love me or even have sex with me. I just wanted him to go out with me for a month or two and just pretend he loved me (he's a really good actor). 

&gt;After that, polite, and funny, but then I realized that he didn't care what I wanted, and he would keep rejecting me, so I had to stop caring about what he wanted and was driven insane by his constant resistance. I just want him to give in to my ultimatum, but for some reason he thinks that his resistance will somehow make me stop pursing him even though I haven't for these three years.

&gt;His wants will not override my need, but I know for a fact that he wouldn't appreciate his fans and would be scared of them. He's a waste of space. He doesn't deserve what he has, but I do. I'd kill him, but its illegal. So, I don't know how to get my revenge or at least reinforce my ultimatum. To be clear, I have nothing against gay people; it's just this one guy because he's so talented, and those aren't traits that are easy to find in straight guys.

&gt;I wouldn't be killing him because of sexual preference. I'd be killing him because he resisted my ultimatum and made me keep chasing.

At some point yesterday, citizenthrowaway explains that his motivation is beyond mere concern for taxpayer dollars:

honestbleeps&gt; it was added to allow ""add captions"" functioanlity back to quickmeme
&lt;honestbleeps&gt; that's all I know about it.
&lt;honestbleeps&gt; it worked when he submitted the PR
&lt;honestbleeps&gt; I accepted the PR because it did what he said.

&lt;honestbleeps&gt; quickmeme accuses them of changing the behavior of resme.me (presumably after the fact) and doing some funky shit.

**The Outing**

However, and in sidebar, you can see that the logged in user is /u/26DeadHands, [a very right-wing poster](http://np.reddit.com/r/new_right/comments/17cr8a/william_kristol_the_audacity_of_nope/), [lazy troll](http://np.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/17d503/the_game_is_up_canucks_now_hand_over_hans_island/c84ebf9) and [apparent](http://np.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/17ab5o/muslim_immigration_not_a_threat_columnist_says/c83rgzu) [xenophobe](http://np.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/17ab5o/muslim_immigration_not_a_threat_columnist_says/c83s551). 

This in and of itself isn't a *huge* deal


**Defense #1: It's just a throwaway!**

SD tries to defend himself
[/u/26DeadHands](http://np.reddit.com/user/26DeadHands) so that he could see if his main's comments were deleted. 

However

/u/guy231 also tries to clarify kcanuck's observation to SD

**Defense #2: It's my brother's account!**

SD [attempts to defend himself again](http://np.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/17dv6v/this_is_unacceptable_behaviour_for_a_moderator_of/c84nkos)

&gt;Nice investigative journalism though. If I were 26DeadHands


desirecampbell again calls him on his bullshit

SD also [tries to convince guy231](http://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/17dv6v/this_is_unacceptable_behaviour_for_a_moderator_of/c84n92a) that he accidentally logged into his brother's account

&gt;This is a different story than you used two posts up.

He then copies/pastes his response to desirecampbell to guy231 as well.


**Defense #3: *You're* the crazy one!**

[SD tries to turn it around on desirecampbell](http://np.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/17dv6v/this_is_unacceptable_behaviour_for_a_moderator_of/c84nx5w)

&gt;You're out to lunch. I said that because I didn't realize at the time that I had taken the screen cap with the wrong account. If you think its impossible for two people to use the same computer for redditing

He then claims that his ""brother's"" accounts

/u/barosa debunks his claims though

&gt;This makes sense

&gt;Say again: Fuck off.

In the end though

&gt;Yes

&gt;We are running out of things to make fun of. We believe if we give everyone an equal shot at posting we wont run out of material.

### Prologue

/u/skeen is the founder of /r/atheism

[One year ago

[Nine months ago

[Less than 12 hours ago

&amp;nbsp;

-----

&amp;nbsp;

### The Removal of /u/skeen as a Moderator of /r/atheism

Knowing that /u/skeen had been inactive for many months, and /r/circlebroke who heavily favor the idea of /u/skeen's removal with a couple dissenting comments. If /u/skeen came back right then and there, this whole dramafest could have been about /u/jij being removed as a moderator instead [like some others were](http://np.reddit.com/r/AntiAtheismWatch/comments/1f8h66/say_goodbye_to_skeen/ca7zxpg).

The SRD thread about it can be found [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1fb093/top_mod_of_ratheism_is_removed_for_inactivity/).

&amp;nbsp;

-----

&amp;nbsp;

### /u/skeen Comes Back

/u/skeen's second discovery after learning he was demodded was the [new moderation policies](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fldpw/mod_post_new_moderation_policy/cad9tap) of /r/atheism where he is told off by other users.

But then /u/skeen opens a can of shitstorm with [a post](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fs930/lets_make_ratheism_free_and_open_again/) rallying people to give him control of /r/atheism again. He gets a lot of positive feedback in his post. The relevant SRD thread can be found [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1fsa28/breaking_uskeen_is_back_and_wants_control_of/)

/u/skeen has been commenting for the last nine hours (as I type). This is probably more activity than he has had in the last year or two. He even showed up in SRD.

#### UPDATE!

/u/skeen is hosting an AMA, is the [top comment!](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1ftifq/ill_do_my_ama_now/cadmr4g)

&amp;nbsp;

-----

&amp;nbsp;

### OH MY ~~GOD~~ SAGAN

It's possible that /u/skeen is [giving up](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1ftifq/ill_do_my_ama_now/cadnr0s).

His last post was an hour ago after non-stop posting all day. I think this is it folks. I think.... we have lost a legend. For six years /u/skeen has logged onto that account

He probably won't delete it

Goodbye skeen.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

### /u/tuber and /u/jij Respond

In an official announcement post

#### UPDATE! (June 8th

Although I posted his account eulogy already

http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fv01d/mod_post_official_retroactivefeedback_thread/caeazg7

http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fv01d/mod_post_official_retroactivefeedback_thread/cae9jdi

Those are his posts in /u/jij's feedback thread, in the feedback thread, it appears there is a majority of people voting to reject /u/jij's new rules.

Nobody will ever tell me I made a mistake with him without getting bitched out about it. Let alone physically assaulted if I'm close enough to them. I adore my child and I've made no mistake in keeping him.

&gt;I didn't say that people shouldn't not want to have children. Don't twist my words you arrogant **fuck**. I said if you DON'T want to have children then use a condom and birth control or don't have sex. But don't have unprotected or semi-unprotected sex

&gt;If having a child means coming off as a huge cunt over the internet then consider me childless for life.

This story starts with applefritter2 posting to the canterlotgardens forums with concern over venue size being that there have been over 2000 tickets sold and the venue is said to only hold about a 1000.

Applefritter2 gets banned from the canterlotgardens forums. Posts to /r/mylittlepony/ instead. 

Klisk (head of PR) shows up and confirms that there isn't any drama here and that the convention can hold 3000 without issue. 

Then Klisk starts throwing around accusations that this drama has been created Purpletinker and choice words of

Expect that Applefritter2 is not Purpletinker. Then the real Purpletinker shows up. And now it gets interesting.

To understand the drama with Purpletinker and Klisk you have to progress back to what started this whole situation. This drama dates all the way back to an earlier con this year.

It's fairly involved and ongoing but the break down to the long ongoing drama is: 

* Money is stolen
&gt;“ The head of their convention, is [Redacted] ) is a literal thief who stole $800 from my personal checking account via [unauthorized] use of my debit card.”
[Redacted]

* Friends of [Redacted] start a smear campaign towards Purple Tinker.

* PurpleTinker attempts to move on in her own way and suggests to canterlotgardens that their venue size is too small.

* Image of said venue size. Numbers far less 2000.

&gt;Quite right too. When a source you (presumably) previously respected reaches a different conclusion from you on some issue, or see whether they've started from a different set of assumptions to you and (if so) ask which set is more reasonable. Instead, you should block out any dissenting voices from your life.

_____________________________

**Background**

There had always been some concern about the effect that being linked in SubredditDrama has on a thread

&gt; There is no reason this subreddit should be raiding other subreddits and downvoting comments made by users to -25 karma while upvoting the other side to +50 karma. That

&gt; We are better than that.

syncretic was not yet a moderator then, [agreed](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/pddrd/meta_seriously_rsubredditdrama_have_we_become_no/c3ogsqv):

&gt; We were never meant to be a downvote brigade. Ever.
However

---

**syncretic's troubled rise to power**

Some time later (June-July), became proactive about possible doxxing and was added as a moderator by /u/creepig, along with others [because ZeroShift was overburdened](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/w06b0/meta_so_srd_hating_syncretic_is_a_mod_here_now/c598ghy). This was not well received by the community, which saw him as a zealous censor and drama magnet: [""So, SRD hating syncretic is a mod here now?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/w06b0/meta_so_srd_hating_syncretic_is_a_mod_here_now/). As [creepig explained](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/w06b0/meta_so_srd_hating_syncretic_is_a_mod_here_now/c595qth):

&gt; If we're going to change the perception that SRD is a downvote brigade

Even then

In response, or as the SubredditDrama moderators called it, ""unmoderated drama"" (but ThePopcornStand's moderators reject that phrase).

[See LetsBeNicer's excellent recap for more.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/w1bb5/recap_syncretic_becoming_mod_of_srd/)

---

**Gearing up for more aggressive moderation**

Just a few days later

Next day at ThePopcornStand

&gt; There's no reasoning with him. He simply declared me a troll and shut me down. 

syncretic proceeded to defend his actions in that ThePopcornStand thread

---

**A new policy appears**

In an extremely controversial SubredditDrama post (Aug. 22)

&gt; Do not post in these linked threads!

&gt; I will be watching

&gt; I have messaged the mods of the involved parties and if any unusual activity is reported by them of a user

Ironically

&gt; Are you going to start banning people for posting in drama threads?

&gt; Short answer: Maybe.

&gt; ...

&gt; Henceforth

&gt; ...

&gt; (Also no

**syncretic takes decisive action as promised**

So here's what I've reconstructed about how things went down this weekend. A moderator of drama-hotspot /r/lgbt [sent a modmail to SubredditDrama](http://i.imgur.com/FQz6D.png) with a list of ""SRD users"" who ""invaded"" /r/LGBTOpenModmail. (This information courtesy of then-SRD moderator /u/TwasIWhoShotJR, not a crazy one""](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/z8j2d/meta_why_is_syncretic_banning_people_for/c62f5cy?context=1), i.e. [not SilentAgony or rmuser](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/z8j2d/meta_why_is_syncretic_banning_people_for/c62l5pk?context=3), [nor RobotAnna](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDramaDrama/comments/z8co4/hold_onto_your_seats_srdders_syncretic_bans_users/c62ifqk?context=3), in case you're keeping score at home.)

So: syncretic posted [an announcement in SubredditDrama](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/z7tzn/announcement_the_following_users_have_been_banned/) that ""The following users have been banned for pissing on the popcorn""

&gt; out of a total of 14 users banned

---

**Dirty laundry**

SubredditDrama's subscribers were outraged, [expressed criticism](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/z8j2d/meta_why_is_syncretic_banning_people_for/c62hb3u): ""Ugh. This is a hot mess."" He proceeded to share what he knew about how the decision was made and implemented among the moderators (which was surprisingly little, perhaps), and even [disagreed with the premise of the new policy](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/z8j2d/meta_why_is_syncretic_banning_people_for/c62hyb9?context=1):

&gt; I will only ban people for using slurs

&gt; What happens in someone else's sub is not my problem.

syncretic posted a lengthy announcement defending his actions, negative reaction from the community, and [even from fellow mod TwasIWhoShotJR](http://i.imgur.com/e6BqG.png). The entire exchange is deleted, allegedly by BritishEnglishPolice.

**A great purge**

As per our sidebar, please hit the report button and send a modmail letting us know. 

Note: ""Encouraging"" includes making it clear that you approve of a dox release. This is a step down the road towards changing the culture of Reddit, they’re more likely to think that it's acceptable. To think “Oh, I don’t like what this person has to say. I’ll just bully them into deleting their account by finding their personal info and revealing it, opening them up to IRL harassment. After all, they deserve it.” At the very least it makes it more likely that they’ll upvote or ignore a post/comment with personal info and move along rather than reporting it to mods/admins. Comments that appear to be applauding the release of dox or expressing sentiments that more such incidences should occur will be removed.

Getting on my soapbox for a second: doxxing is wrong. It was wrong for Adrien Chen to do it to VA, feel free to campaign against them or just ignore them, but don’t shred the cloak of anonymity we all hold dear.

The other thing I wanted to talk about is the aftermath of removing the rule against personal attacks

We've been seeing a lot of bitterness and hate in comments lately. Since removing the rule against personal attacks, the mod team has decided to reinstate the rule against personal attacks. Removing personal attacks isn’t done to protect people’s feelings, but to maintain quality of discussion. Comments consisting purely of a personal attack do not add to the discussion. Criticism is still perfectly acceptable of course, as long as you back it up. For example: “You’re a stupid bitch” does not make for good discussion. Any comment chain that is allowed to devolve to that level is probably not going to rise back up to a reasonable level of discourse. “I think it was stupid of you to do this, this, and this, because ___” does add to the conversation and can lead to an interesting dialogue.

Within a couple hours, and Mittens admits that he is willing to bring down every meta sub including SubredditDrama in his campaign against vote brigades.

Mittens then posted a formal petition to [AntiSRS](http://www.reddit.com/r/antisrs/comments/10t0e4/now_that_the_admins_have_banned/) and [SRSSucks](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/10t0fu/now_that_the_admins_have_banned/) calling on the admins to ban ShitRedditSays for vote brigading.

[This thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/RedditRescueForce/comments/y86sn/warning_after_rescuing_a_dude_he_shooted_me/) is started, a medic, rescued him. 

Members of the reddit [find the players Teamspeak ID](http://www.reddit.com/r/RedditRescueForce/comments/y86sn/warning_after_rescuing_a_dude_he_shooted_me/c5t747i)  and [ban him from the rescue force Teamspeak.](http://www.reddit.com/r/RedditRescueForce/comments/y86sn/warning_after_rescuing_a_dude_he_shooted_me/c5t7o5i)


However, as the camp the OP took him back to was packed with obviously duplicated items (duplication is when players abuse a glitch within the game to unfairly gain large quantities of rare items). The OP responds, claiming that it is not his camp (though in [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/RedditRescueForce/comments/y86sn/warning_after_rescuing_a_dude_he_shooted_me/c5t8i23) op suggests otherwise), but that the people who ran the Dayz server he was using had created it, and that when first found the OP and his friends had destroyed it. He then says that the server admins reset the server in order to get their camp back, so he claims to have decided the best thing to do is slowly give away their items to people he helps. The OP claims several of the items at the camp, including vehicles (which are hard to find), and becomes more angry than he already was upon being told by the shooter that everything has been destroyed. The subreddit users become divided

Delicious drama is had.



**Brief explanation of Dayz &amp; /r/RedditRescueForce:**

Dayz (/r/dayz) is a game set in a zombie apocalypse, players can only become 'better' by finding better equipment, which is randomly generated in certain areas. The game is a fairly realistic mod, based on the military simulator Arma 2. Dayz is multiplayer, and players are much more likely to kill than help each other, due to problems with trusting other players. When players die they randomly spawn in one of a number of certain areas, and their items remain on their old body

/r/RedditRescueForce is a subreddit of players who behave as medics going out and rescuing other players who are dying. This is done by having the player log out of the game till the medic is nearby. This is quite a big thing because some medical help can only be applied by other players

**TL;DR EXTRA-SHORT RECAP**: a medic saved another players life, and upon coming to believe the medic was a cheater the player shot him in the back and blew his camp up. The medic then posted about this to get him banned so no medics will help him in future, but the situation becomes morally confusing when the player who shot the medic posts his side of the story, defending his actions.

edit2: making stuff pretty

1336756232.0,tif0f,My new hobby: Watching WorstAnswerPossible being constantly tournament by hecklers who think he sucks.,novelTaccountability,434,159,298,"One of the highlights of my day is reading WorstAnswerPossible's comments in-context and seeing people constantly heckle him to the point where he breaks character and tries to garner pity for himself. This phenomenon will occur at least 2-3 times a day

For those unfamiliar with him WorstAnswerPossible is a negative response troll who just writes the most negative opinion he can in any comment thread (mostly r/askreddit). That's pretty much it. They usually involve rape, pedophilia, incest, gay bashing, etc. In the past all the other negative response trolls would be buried in downvotes in a matter of minutes after posting their schtick and there are several well know trolls with high negative karma points. The thing about WorstAnswerPossible though, is that he gave himself a Novelty Account name, and now the Narwhals-Bacon-Retards

Another thing about WorstAnswerPossible is that he's a comment spammer. Often leaving 40-50+ comments per day. So with that being said there are a lot more opportunities to be heckled because he comments so much. He actually comments so much that it's hard to keep up with all the people heckling him, or ""You're slipping a but, but upvote for effort"". Then they get progressively worse, til we get to the point where people are just telling him to ""die"" and are getting upvoted for it. There are even imposter accounts and accounts created specifically to ""troll"" him.

The funny part is that WorstAnswerPossible is so fragile that he's actually easily affected by all the teasing. And he constantly breaks ""character"" to defend himself from what he believes to be a mobilized conspiracy against him and is account. Which might exists

Here is a selection of hits just from the just the last 3 days or so:

It's only been 21 days since the last update and in that short amount of time, but there is *already* too much drama for me to fit in one post.

And it is with that that I present to you what will likely be the last 2 chapters in this saga. Here is part 4 to ""A Cheater's Tale"".
-------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------

**Chapter  11: ""I don't know what is wrong with me""**

We last left off on November 20th

Posters berated him for ""thinking only about [him]self"", blames his wife for his affair, and confesses that he ""[doesn't] know what is wrong with [him]"".  

He writes to a fellow cheater who berated his apparent selfishness:

&gt;I honest to God wish I could feel the shame you feel about your actions. I want to be there. I wish I had the drive to do whatever it takes to fix this but I don't. I don't know why. I did make a decision. I want to be with my BW [SI term for ""Betrayed Wife""] but.... if she doesn't want me - which I agree is her choice than **I want to be with someone who wants me.** 

On November 29th, won't talk to [him, and acts like [he doesn't] exist.""  He goes on to say that his wife had been ignoring him for 5 days and that he ""was beginning to doubt [he had]  the strength to take this."" He then waxes fondly about his affair:

&gt;**I was unhappy before but at least I had OW. Now I have no one** and I have a wife that is acting like I am dead to her. I am not all trying to get sympathy but it is very trying. 

As posters again tell him to be patient with his shocked wife and to hold strong on not contacting Emma

&gt;No. Not yet. BW hasn't been in it since D-Day and if we start to move towards reconciling than I'll get rid of it. Just right now no one knows where we are

He then asserts that he wasn't actually missing Emma

&gt;If she posts and the advice is negative I'm going to be kicking myself. So I don't know. Its going to sound incredibly selfish but I have to do protect myself too. My wife is eating and seems to be doing okay but I will check up on her and make sure she is taking care of herself. She is usually very responsible and I imagine everything is fine. 

[The next day in the same thread](http://www.survivinginfidelity.com/forums.asp?tid=479007&amp;AP=41&amp;HL=37452)

&gt;She started in on me in the car and it wasn't quite anger but it was more of just her being stunned at me. She asked me why again and we talked about things a little more on the way home and I let her say what she wanted to say. 

&gt;She opened up to me a lot and told me how she never ever wanted this to happen and how hurt she was that I would do this to her. That she felt betrayed and broken and that seeing me made her feel awful. 

&gt;BW wasn't saying anything because she didn't want to create a scene in front of our kids and because she wasn't ready yet. So it was wrong of me to be impatient with her. 

She eventually tells Noah that she doesn't want to divorce and that she'd like to work on the marriage

&gt;**OW

&gt;**Our affair was a mistake and never should have happened. It was cruel and hurtful to my wife and children. I regret every second of our affair. I am committed to doing whatever it takes to fix my marriage and be the man my wife and children deserve. Move on with your life and leave me alone. Do not ever contact me again.**

Noah also gushes that he has created a timeline of recovery for them, to the point where his wife let him kiss her. He then apologizes for the self-pitying tone of his past posts.
Posters go on to grill him on what his game plan is to prevent another affair

By December 1st in that same thread

&gt;And to think I came so close to reaching out to OW again. Its pathetic really. How fucking screwed up is that? 

-------------------------------------------

**Chapter 12: "" [M]y man-child of a husband couldn't keep it in his pants""**

On December 2nd, I will simply call her Laura (not her real name).  

[Author's note: *I don't want to share her username because she's still an active user on SI and she has expressed a desire for privacy

Laura's first few posts are quite short

However

On December 3rd

She vents that she hates Noah for ""ruining this pregnancy"" for her and for ""turning it into a nightmare."" However

In a later thread asking if betrayed spouses would like to know the details of their SO's affair

That same day, and Laura agrees with their assessment that Emma is a ""bunny boiler"". She professes a desire to ""destroy this girl"", and cries that not only is Emma very attractive, but she apparently had ""great sex"" with Noah.

Laura also starts giving advice to other betrayed spouses

On December 4, number of times they fucked, etc.), and says that **Noah claims he was ""temporarily addicted"" to sex after their years of infrequent sex.**  

Laura tells another poster that she wishes she could just leave

&gt;**I just don't want to believe this is my life.**

On December 7th, that he had always been flirtatious which was why she had been accusing him of cheating, and sadly noting that all cheaters' stories on SI seem to have the same misleading twists to them.

Later that night, saying that she used to respond to all of his messages.**  This sets Laura off, and she tells him to fuck off, angrily argues that Emma should've never been involved in their marriage, and again notes that Noah's neediness is comparable to a child's. 

She writes to SI about the incident later that day

She sagely observes:

&gt;**He wants someone like OW who will tell him he is perfect when he is fucking up.**

The claim that I made alt accounts to upvote posts (that are not even mine) was no more than a sarcastic spoof in response to /r/MLPlounge[1] 's constant raiding for the past week. Well that's tough because reddit.com has censored my freedom of speech.

1.  So it all started out with this thread where it was announced that MLG one of the biggest lan events in the world was dropping Starcraft 2 - http://www.redditlog.com/snapshot/15732/20523

  The entire thread became a pitchfork war like r/Starcraft has not seen in sometime with many proclaiming (again) that this is the end of Starcraft. 

2.  As the pitchforks were still red hot TotalBiscuit a personality and team owner in the scene announced his retirement from casting Starcraft for as he said it what is the point. -http://www.redditlog.com/snapshot/15729/20524

  This just led to more pitchforks and doomsday calling. Tb got his fair few forks thrown at him even getting [called out by one of his friends and another prominent figure in the scene


3.  As the forks glowed red a new thread emerges reminding everyone to unsub from MLG demand their money back and quote the reason why to them. It seems in alot of instances this quote went something like [""fuck you for not supportting starcraft""](http://img43.imageshack.us/img43/7727/p8sp.jpg)

6.  Which lead beautifully into the lastest thread from a half hour ago which posted a tweet from another key figure in the community and former Team Evil Genius's owner Sir Scoots who got leaked information that infact the reason the MLG will not be using Starcraft 2 for the last lan of the season is because the date was already pre-ordered by Redbull for their own event. - [**obligatory**](http://www.dramabutton.com/)

This whole drama started when a popular streamer got kicked out of a game and couldn't log back in. The hacker then came into the stream, he took over the most popular player's account. He then posted Moonmeander's password in the stream for everyone to see. [He then makes a post and proves that he took over Moonmeander's account](http://i.imgur.com/DJLol.png) Here is the [video of it all happening in stream](http://www.twitch.tv//moonmeander/b/348625189?utm_campaign=archive_embed_click&amp;utm_source=bashtech.net) (It happens at end of video, 1:59:30)

The announcer of all the tournament games (BreakyCPK) [also got his Twitter account hacked](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/HeroesofNewerth/comments/14ypen/breakycpk_confirms_password_leaks/) because his in-game password was the same as his twitter password.

S2 (the company) then comes into /r/HeroesofNewerth and says [""We are looking into what is going on. We will let you know when we have more information

For a while now the modteam has noticed an excessive amount of SRS-related drama in SRD. Yesterday [a thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/19xnx1/meta_ban_srsantisrs_drama/) has made us mods aware the community is also growing tired of the glut.

SRD has become a battleground for two warring factions. The flamewars come like clockwork

Personally I'd say the real harm of the deluge of SRS-related posts is that they push good drama off the front page. I check the new queue fairly often

Starting Monday

Now

EXPERIMENT

**EXPERIMENT**

Also, not because of some sort of coordinated effort to game the comments section. 

The Megathread will be posted and stickied Monday

[Negro_Napoleon](http://www.reddit.com/user/Negro_Napoleon) was banned from [/r/Christianity](/r/Christianity) for posting one of their threads on [/r/atheism](/r/atheism) (under 'linkjacking' policy in place since 2010

User complains that he had no idea about the rule, and that the mods are being irrational (meanwhile, the mods reason with him for ~24 hours). User then asks if the ban will ever be lifted; in light of the above ~~butthurt~~ indignant thread on /r/atheism, mods say 'probably not'. User continues to pitch a fit.

As for his attempt to rally fellow /r/atheists

1370316112.0,1fmnbw,[Meta] Announcing the removal of the SRS Megathread and the introduction of a filtering system!,MillenniumFalc0n,313,103,336,"First off

**The SRS Megathread**

In other meta news, we will continue removing posts that consist merely of ""SRS brigaded this thing and is yelling at people"" and we will be directing them to /r/srssucks.  Other kinds of SRS drama are fair game to post, but may be tagged as low-hanging fruit (more about the new filtering system below). Under this new policy, dramatic happenings within SRS will still be allowed while hopefully discouraging stale brigading drama. To be clear, this will not just apply to SRS, posts just pointing out brigades do not belong in SRD, there needs to be some bona-fide drama attached!

**Filtering**

SRD has implemented a new filtering system! This is mostly in response to the weariness many subscribers have expressed with certain topics. These will be tagged as ""low-hanging fruit."" Drama from /r/cringe, /r/theredpill, /r/mensrights, /r/shitredditsays, etc. will usually fall in this category, as will topics such as SJ arguments and warphalange drama (though it has been a while since we've seen that).

You may have noticed that some posts that broke the ""full comments"" rule were flaired and allowed to stay up. We are removing that flair template in favor of a new rule: **ANY** post that links to the full comments must be a self post

[**Screencapped OP**](http://i.imgur.com/doFmO.jpg)

**Post summary:**

/u/enla1 tells /r/relationships about his and his girlfriend's unsuccessful attempt at having a threesome with his girlfriend's close friend. He describes feeding the friend wine in an attempt to get her drunk enough to have the threesome

Eventually the 3 end up on a couch, the friend flees and the girlfriend retreats to her room, where OP follows her and they lay down together. All seems well, but when it comes time for OP to leave for the night, she flips out in fear that he's leaving *her*. OP recalls the conversation:

&gt;Her: YOU WANT TO FUCK HER AND NOT ME.

&gt;Me: (ohh god)

&gt;Her TELL ME YOU LOVE ME MORE THAN HER.

&gt;Me: Shut up

&gt;Her: WHY WONT YOU SAY IT. BECAUSE YOU LIKE HER BETTER.

&gt;Me: This is just ridiculous if you are going to be this way I am going to leave.

&gt;Her: YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO LEAVE.

&gt;Me: Watch me.

When OP goes for the door, and he tries to reason(?) with her by saying:

&gt;You are trying to force me to stay here that's equivalent to rape. You are raping me right now. Stop it.

She starts biting the fuck out of him, and he goes home. He then asks /r/relationships how he should explain his facial wounds to his parents.

**The Comments**

Support for OP was mixed, saying that [OP was also in the wrong for punching her in the face](http://i.imgur.com/zq5wa.jpg) and got an almost even downvote/upvote ratio for it (20+:26-). 

In response to chocolatehearts' response,](http://i.imgur.com/9g0co.jpg) snidely adding:

&gt; Or his mommy and daddy if that's what he's so worried about

**This is where the real drama begins

/u/SamRavister gets pissed at mademoiselle_B's comment

&gt;Well well well

mademoiselle_B defends herself by calling OP a ""woman hating asshole"" and gladly claims the title of ""twisted bitch"" for her comment.

OP then replies to mademoiselle_B's blaming of him

&gt;nice shaming language you fucking cunt. im going to assume, clawed your face off, and bitten you to the point of drawing blood multiple times. after a while, especially after a hard day drinking, you just kind of collapse from tiredness 

mademoiselle_B then asks OP if this is the first time a girl's gone crazy on him, actually... ????????????????"" it was his first time being assaulting by a woman. Ignoring this, mademoiselle_B says that:

&gt;it doesnt seem like you need that big of a reason to punch a girl in the face if you're saying i deserve it because i said you shouldve called your parents

The rest of that thread may or may not be [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/10cc6c/my_25m_gf_23f_lost_her_shit_after_urging_me_to/c6cacwo). At the time of this writing, saying ""im ready for the stoning. i know it'll hurt but i deserve it""  More users try to explain to moiselle that OP's girlfriend was endangering his life, but she continues to argue with them.

Don't worry
 
**Crying Rape**

In a different reply to OP's post

&gt;What's the difference. She used violence to force me to be with her. No penetration therefore it's not rape? Consent was blurry? Gee you sound like a rapist!

&gt;Edit-- As to the MRA troll

He goes on to later elaborate that 

&gt;the analogy is used to make a point

to which mademoiselle_B (sarcastically?) says that she ""think[s] he's a rapist too"".

**OP v. the MRAs &amp; mademoiselle_B**

A self-proclaimed MRA, telling OP that deserves to be ""fucked"" in the legal sense and calling bullshit on OP's self defense claim because ""you close fist punched your girlfriend in the face"". He goes on to tell OP that there's no chance that law enforcement with side with him. OP simply responds to the last point, cheekily writing ""Rite?""

As if on cue, and he tells moiselle to ""just fucking die already jesus christ"". 

OP also [both insults and praises MRAs later](http://i.imgur.com/nH9A9.jpg) by saying ""the MRAs are pussies who are off their rocker but that doesn't make them wrong about their general beliefs."" /u/MorbidMarshmallow tells OP that he has lost all credibility because he's ""proven [him]self an asshole

**""Christ

&gt;You made a bunch of shitty decisions and got a predictably shitty result. And you are trying to turn this into some sort of men's rights, go tell your parents the whole story, just like you've posted it here. Maybe it's not too late for them to turn you into a decent, functional human being.

OP gets defensive, and Smitty simply points out that OP is proving his point about OP's immaturity. 

/u/urbanexotic also [jumps onto](http://i.imgur.com/5MXbR.jpg) the ""let's call OP an asshole"" bandwagon

This seems to strike a nerve in OP

&gt;**Wow. Another man-hating sexist cunt.** Again

You can read istilllkeme's account of what went down [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1j48g9/6_of_american_adults_use_reddit_number_is/cbb3kml)

&gt;First I got shadowbanned for asking about investors behind reddit in [this thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1if813/introducing_manualreddit_upvote_your_world_with/cb3vl8q). [These](http://minus.com/mu7HzwZpC3cRi?context=3) were the comments that got my oldest and dearest accounts (some as old as six years) banned. Erik Martin tries to claim [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1ii527/here_is_the_place_to_discuss_rpolitics_removal/cb4s2mk?context=3) that he shadowbanned me for vote cheating in the /r/blog thread
&gt;
Then
&gt;
After agreeing to not shadowban me anymore for my opinion he did it again for [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1ivwmw/uyudi332_shadowbannedmysteriously_disappeared/cb8t3p6?context=3) comment
&gt;
This has all happened in the past 8 days and it all started because I started pressing on who the investors were behind reddit inc and I have proof that an admin has used certain groups of people on this site to spam for a holding profile of a certain group of resturants. That evidence is peppered throughout my examples and Erik has refused to comment on that evidence
  
He's basically provided ready access to the meat of the drama by the links within his story. So there's not too much else I need to say. There's probably more to this drama if you poke around. In the interest of promoting neutrality I'd like point out the obvious: it's a conspiracy theory so take it with a pinch of salt and enjoy the drama.

**UPDATE: And then shit got real.**

/u/david-me found some crazy additional content which I have posted below. Before you read it, and especially the mods and most everyone else here when I say this young woman does not deserve to be witch hunted.  She is young and dumb, like we all have been, and she does not respond to criticism well, just like the rest of us. 

So put yourself in her shoes and realize she's not going to respond perfectly to withering criticism

**Please do not form a bravery jerk and try to ""put her in her place"" either on reddit or on YouTube. Just watch in amusement and eat popcorn

Edit 1: 

* An hour ago she just posted a new video in which a 2 year old is muzzle swept by a shotgun that is laying half off a table for a full 7 seconds.  At one point the child stares down the barrel of the gun.   [/r/firearms does not find this amusing.](http://np.reddit.com/r/Firearms/comments/1f29o8/great_grandaddys_shotgun/) 

It is now several hours later

After being asked whether she realized she muzzle swept the kid

&gt;Hey Liberal anti gun nut! Guns do NOT shoot people! People shoot people! So do you think an unloaded gun is somehow going to magically jump up load itself and then shoot someone??? Is that something that you heard on MSNBC could happen??? You Obama voters kill me!! Just saying :)

After being corrected on the four rules of gun safety

&gt;Those rules are AWESOME however they only apply to guns in YOUR Possession! Basic general rules of safe gun handling imply's that you are HANDLING the gun!! As in the GUN is in YOUR HANDS!!! NOT laying on a freaking table!!!! MY GOD!!! How much of this retardation do I need to deal with in this life???????? **I'm an 18 year old girl and I seem to me smarter than 95% of the people on reddit!!! FUUUUK!**

/u/Cdwollan bends over backward to try to put her in the right direction.  She responds by calling him a retard. Repeatedly. 

&gt;Retard!! Watch the freaking video I showed the gun to be unloaded and it was laying on a flipping table two feet from me and it's trigger! At no time was that child in danger you flipping Jack Ass!!! BTW that table is it's home so suck it!

Finally, unlike her superficial channel. 

One excellent example is ""Ryan's Range Report"" by /u/dieselgeek. [You can find it here, he has really stepped up his game over the last year. ](http://www.youtube.com/user/DallasfuckingTT?feature=watch)

 &gt;I only get trolled on reddit in fact if you go to my YouTube channel you will see that this video like all my videos is being well received! I have 4500 Subscribers and 241

She thinks gay people are freaks.

&gt;Get your ass back to Brokeback Mountain Freak!!

Again

Edit 2:

* She has another alt sock account where she has been trying to post her videos on reddit. She even posted them to a satirical gun sub which I shall not name thinking it was the proper place for them (I actually had removed one over a month ago). That is pretty embarrassing

Like when a user tried to give her genuinely constructive criticism and she posted this on her alt (now she's on both accounts in the same thread):

&gt;""Bad nunchuck video"" WOW you are a real peace of work! Krysta my advice is to disregard anything from this troll! Much like in life **he does not rate talking to a girl like you!

[Skeen](/user/skeen)

Soon after,~~ added a rule to reduce the number of image posts on the front page and improve the content mix: direct link image posts are not allowed, but links to images in self-posts are.  The rule denies karma to users posting images, and makes the opening of image posts a little more clunky (2-clicks vs. 1-click).  

To put it lightly, when every single post was a complaint (if anyone has an image I can link to, I would appreciate it!).  In the face of this onslaught, Jij made a post suggesting he was ready to concede.  

But then today

* Moderator [tuber](/user/tuber) added more mods to /r/atheism
* Complaints about the new rule are temporarily banned in r/atheism.  Users wanting to vent are being directed to [/r/atheismpolicy](/r/atheismpolicy).
* The mods said flat out that the r/atheism rules will not change so long as people are trying to sabotage the sub.

Some of you may be familiar with the virtual pet website, intended to be a more specialized discussion space where people can go to get help or advice regarding Neopets. 

**The Drama**

When Nowits makes a thread in r/neopets advertising r/neopia

**The Drama in the Drama** (*yo dawg*)

To justify his actions, both Fuzio and Lupevs accuse the other of [taking things too seriously](http://np.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/y029q/lets_have_another_bragging_thread_reddit/c5riplo) while writing up [long responses](http://np.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/y029q/lets_have_another_bragging_thread_reddit/c5rj4hs) to argue with each other over the internet on a forum about an internet game whose primary userbase is tweenage girls. 

The whole thing is worth a skim


This aged thread is literally full of people calling Fuzio a [dick](http://np.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/y029q/lets_have_another_bragging_thread_reddit/c5rdw9c)

**Back Up One Level**

If we return to the original thread after that tasty detour

Fuzio then writes [a long rambling comment containing lots of information of questionable relevancy](http://www.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/1a3kbh/hey_i_just_created_rneopia_last_week_its_designed/c8udiaf) that doesn't really prove much of anything

It was mentioned in another meta thread that the Saydrah drama was larger than the Laurelai drama. Now, is that we scrap the current measurement of La and replace it with a system similar to metric.

Under this system

You're probably wondering ""Molly, RobotAnna, Laurelai, MaterialDesigner) thus far. The hypothesis here is that if we were to ever have drama that has 10 separate Laurelai-worthy dramallamas, then it would hit critical mass and be as large as the Saydrah incident.
Here's an example scale

1 Sa - Reddit-wide drama equivalent to Saydrah. This could also include front page incidents such as the banning of /r/jailbait or the Woody Harrelson AMA

9 La - /r/Marijuana vs /r/trees.

8 La - The SRS Fempire in general.

7 La - Witchhunts involving multiple major subreddits.

6 La - Major subreddit witchhunts.

5 La - The /r/LGBT drama as of May 2012

4 La - Multi-sub witchhunts (Non-major subs)

3 La - /r/MensRights on an average day.

2 La - Small subreddit contained witchhunts.

1 La - A single mod losing their shit.

.5 La - Someone has mildly rustled jimmies. Perhaps due to a troll.

0 La - Buisness as usual. No drama.

As you can see

**Edit: The Jimmy Rustle Index

On suggestion of ArchangelleXerxes

Jimmy Rustle Index (JRI)

Category 1 - Intentionally humorous drama. Only the very stupid would mistake it for serious drama. Entertaining nonetheless. (/r/pickle vs. /r/banana)

Category 2 - Someone is clearly trolling

Category 3 - Slap-fight has broken out. This can be the result of a troll

Category 4 - Bans are now involved. SRS has probably posted about it. Shit has come in contact with fans.

Category 5 - Theoretical perfect storm. The equivalent of the elusive (actual) [10] in /r/trees.

1356035158.0,156oe3,[recap] The War Z,ToughAsGrapes,232,47,55,"Please note

--------------------------------------------------------

Once upon a time there was a game called Arma 2:combined operations and for that game there was a mod that went by the name of Day Z. The Day Z mod was phenomenally successful and made Bohemia Interactive

And then Hammerpoint Interactive decided that they wanted to create a similar game by the name of the War Z  and as soon as everyone heard the news people started saying  that it was an enormous rip off. That they where simply trying to cash in on the success of Day Z and that they even had a similar name as Day Z. This is backed up by [images comparing War Z with War Inc](http://imgur.com/a/ZSf5V) (which was the previous game Hammerpoint Interactive had released.) [Reddit post](http://redd.it/ygwyw)


The controversy started when one of the [WarZ producers call players faggots for camping](http://uk.gamespot.com/news/the-war-z-producer-calls-campers-fgots-6398729)
&gt;""I'm trying to play at least couple hours a day every single day. Getting killed a lot

Next came the revelation that the [War Z copy pastes terms of service from League of Legends](http://i.imgur.com/EBOr7.jpg). [Reddit post.](http://redd.it/11jk83)


Followed by an update where the developers forced people to [pay 750 gold coin to create a clan.](http://redd.it/13wuol) [Twitter link.](https://twitter.com/The_War_Z/status/273604251639500800)


Then there were claims by a former moderator that his account had been hacked and that the [company are going to abandon the game](http://i.imgur.com/62kg1.jpg) in 6 months if they don't get enough revenue from it. He also said that the company was banning random accounts to get people to rebuy the game

[Turns out most of this was lies

The drama was further escalated when one player experienced problems with the game


Its also worth noting at this point that the Executive Producer

After that there was a heavily [upvoted post](http://redd.it/151f1d) on /r/gaming say that the [developers lied about many of the games features.](http://i.imgur.com/j9Q3f.jpg)

Meanwhile there is much argueing on the [steam forum.](http://i.imgur.com/Pi3my.png) [Reddit post.](http://redd.it/150iso)

Popular youtuber Total Biscuits then makes a [video about the WarZ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtKAm3nzg6I)

* It looked ugly and had low texture quality
* That the ability to buy in game items for real world cash was ethically questionable and went against the idea of a zombie survival game.
* The game itself was as boring as hell.

/u/Bromazepam points out in the comments that there is something horribly wrong with the reflections when he spots the reflection of [a flash light in the water.](http://i.imgur.com/TEdi2.jpg)
Later comfirmed by [this](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=114076844) post on the steam forums.

Total Biscuit later uploaded an [update about the WarZ affair](http://youtu.be/3IQrhrooSOY?t=1m25s) the next day.


/u/IAmFluffey [makes a reddit post](http://redd.it/152tbh) stating that the WarZ has updated its game so that it's even more of a money grab. You now have to wait four hours instead of one for one of your characters to respawn and there is an option for you to pay real money to buy back into the game. They also forced you to sign a TOS which disallows refunds.


Someone starts a [petition to remove on steam](http://steamcommunity.com/app/226700/discussions/0/828925849084337399/) with over a thousand comments in it.


Developers do an [interview with game spy](http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/the-war-z/1226980p1.html?utm_campaign=twposts&amp;utm_source=twitter) in which he tries to defend the game and it's lack of features. (Spoiler

&gt;Let's be frank: when you read ""up to 100 players"" -- what does it mean to you personally? I mean

&gt;There's no such thing as ""Release"" for an online game.

He then makes a [forum post](http://forums.thewarz.com/showthread.php?79251-Steam-purchase-page-issues) in which he blames customers for misreading the steam page.


Now what do you do when people start criticizer you


Rhino crunch posts a [video stating the game is a scam](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXKu5lV69V8) and that the developers lied.

* He says that the game was only in development recently when it had been previously stated that it had been in development for years.
* He also claims that the game is nothing more than a mod and that they pulled people from War inc to make WarZ
* He was then blocked from there twitter after trying to confront them.

Rhinocrunch later made another review in which he bacisally says [I told you so.](http://youtu.be/BUrKdAjN4DM)

The game is finally [removed from steam.](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/12/19/the-war-z-no-longer-available-on-steam/)

Valve then offers people that have brought the game a refund and issued a statement say:

&gt;From time to time a mistake can be made and one was made by prematurely issuing a copy of War Z for sale via Steam. We apologize for this and have temporary removed the sale offering of the title until we have time to work with the developer and have confidence in a new build. Those who purchase the game and wish to continue playing it via Steam may do so. Those who purchased the title via Steam and are unhappy with what they received may seek a refund by creating a ticket at our support site [here.](https://support.steampowered.com/newticket.php)

All this drama surrounding the game currently has resulted in it being given a [meta critic rating of 1.1](http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/the-war-z) dispite the developers asking people [to vote for them](http://forums.thewarz.com/showthread.php?79039-War-Z-on-metacritic-tell-us-what-do-you-think-!).


Sergey Titov does an [interview](http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/12/20/the-war-z-interview-sergey-titov-backlash/) with PC gamer in which he talks about the problems the game has had and what has caused them. He all say the game has almost 700

[Someone was able to take pic of the thread right before it was all deleted](http://i.imgur.com/FHecc.png)

Its been almost 4 hours after the thread deletion and /r/canada mods are currently stalking the new tab and deleting any post that mentions the banning's or asks about them. 

So far no one that's been banned has received an answer [except for one](http://i.imgur.com/49T7S.jpg).


/r/metacanada decided to counter this by spamming /r/canadas comments with a link to the thread and the pic to try and create some awareness.

I got a few complaints through PM by SRD users I recognised as being here a while (yes, they should do it in the best interest of the subreddit and then stick to that; in the face of opposition they should perhaps review the decision and pull it out [no-one's perfect]. 

But arguing in public gives the impression we are so fractured that not even our janitors can keep it together. We all know we have a problem of downmodding stuff linked here. I had an idea brought to me by /u/eternalkerri that I'd like your thoughts on:

&gt; All drama linked here must be at least 24 hours old in age from the start of the drama

This way we can ensure that most of the drama has already *happened*. What're your thoughts? 

Oh, why I came on mostly in the first place. Also, *dem spamqueues*)?

**Background**

For those who don't know

A little over a week later, he [made a ShibeGen](http://np.reddit.com/r/SRSFunny/comments/13yzsw/shibegen_its_happening/) and then went ahead and made /r/shibe the next day. [This was his first post there](http://np.reddit.com/r/shibe/comments/141gvv/marx_shibe/). 

During its short life,848 readers as of its shutdown today.

**""FEMINISM IS AWESOME AND BY POSTING HERE YOU AGREE TO BE MISANDERED""**

On March 15

&gt;yes the change to text posts on r shibe is intended to kill the sub lol

or at least to ""stop drive by redditors from posting"" because he hated their post history and thought they weren't funny. 

A week later [devtesla updates his personal sub's subscribers on his experiment](http://np.reddit.com/r/devtesla/comments/1at8os/well_text_post_didnt_scare_away_the_shitlords_lol/)

&gt;FEMINISM IS AWESOME AND BY POSTING HERE YOU AGREE TO BE MISANDERED

He also lets /r/shibe know that [he's started banning people](http://np.reddit.com/r/shibe/comments/1avorc/banned_someone_here_is_their_responce/) for making ""rape jokes"". 

In April

&gt;I looked some of the comment herstories for the users and they definitely had shitlord comments

However

&gt;This is idiotic. It isn't automatically racist to make fun of North Korea unless you actually say something racially insensitive. Nobody's on there going ""wow

He gets banned for ""being a racist"".

On April 7

In the message

**""I think a better idea would be to just remove r shibe lol""**

A few days later

&gt;I think a better idea would be to just remove r shibe lol

devtesla's shibe-related activity then remains fairly low-key for the next few weeks


**""hahahahahaha oh wow shutting down r shibe forever""**

The thread also contains [a sidebar on the merits of ""gamer girls""](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/12m90e/nanibrows/c6wb9cl)

&gt;When I introduce myself

&gt;Proper eye contact? SHIIIIIIIT! She's so beautiful I might end up staring for too long.

&gt;If I update you while we're talking

&gt;IMPORTANT! Please do not upvote this post. It might get into the frontpage and she might check Reddit on her phone later. Thanks DrWallyHayes for making me realize it.

&gt;Edit1- So, that's like England, circa 1970.

&gt;Edit2- She took her phone out and the tension is worse than when I was being circumcised! Good thing she just looked at the screen for a while and returned it to its case.

&gt;Edit3- Shit. Almost 30 minutes now and the only thing I've said to her is ""My pleasure."" Fucking fuck.

&gt;Edit4- It's almost over an hour and I'm like a PC with no soundcard. shit. shit. shit.

&gt;Edit5- Did you guys just put this in the frontpage? FUCK!

&gt;Edit6- Guys

&gt;Edit7- Well, 3 hours more!

&gt;Edit8- She seems to be asleep so I got the chance to stare at her for an extended period of time. Almighty God Lord Jesus Christ she is so beautiful. must.resist.taking.a.pic. To those asking me to take a pic

&gt;Edit11- I apologize in advance if this does not end the way you are expecting. this is the longest time I have sat beside a girl with our shoulders rubbing once in a while. It's not that easy.

&gt;Edit12- I really don't want to comment on her ample breasts or long

Here it gets interesting: ssyncretic (not the real syncretic) suggests that syncretic helped with the possible doxxer to [improve his chance of getting modded.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/w06b0/meta_so_srd_hating_syncretic_is_a_mod_here_now/c597w8h) creepig denies this of course

&gt; Because syncretic had no idea that his actions would lead to getting modded. We don't tell people that they're in the running until their modding is essentially a forgone conclusion. It is not possible for him to have come up with such a dastardly plan to infiltrate our subreddit if he didn't know that he could end up modded for it.

http://pastebin.com/ezbsuamy

[21:10] &lt;@syncretic&gt; I think some sort of ""neutrality"" rule would be in the same vein as the ""don't submit drama you're involved with"" rule.  
[21:10] == Addyct_  has joined #subredditdrama  
[21:10] &lt;@syncretic&gt; It would prevent people from submitting drama when they have a ""horse in the race"" so to speak.  
[21:11] &lt;@ZeroShift&gt; Agreed  
[21:11] &lt;@syncretic&gt; If enforced properly it would force SRD to become more of a catalog of drama instead of someone's personal army.

So I tried a few more times. Each time I got ¯(ツ)/¯ back. Now...I didn't really care much about being banned from r/ShitRedditSays. It doesn't look like it would interest me but I was curious as to why a mod had banned me. 

So

 So...I messaged therealbarackobama back with this....

&gt;I did post to that thread but it certainly wasn't anything creepy. I replied to a post by 'supergood' who said ""But such large teeth.."".

I'm guessing fxexular is the girl in the photo. However I certainly didn't intend to be creepy - in fact it was directed at 'supergood'. So

therealbarackobama replied: ""we banned a lot of people for being creepy thread

Now

&gt;Hey thanks for that. It would really help if mods could respond the way you have. I asked fxexular repeatedly for a reason and each time they replied with ""¯(ツ)/¯"". I don't think this helps anyone and gives the impression that mods are children on a power-trip.

His response surprised me.

Now after all that for some inexplicable reason they decided to nuke their own official forums and migrate to social media as their official community outlet

The announcement blew up in multiple subreddits

[First of all we have an /r/games thread sitting at over 700 upvotes. Things are pretty civil but people generally aren't exactly happy about Hi-Rez. Lots of bad PR.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1jraz0/hirez_is_closing_down_their_official_forum_and/)

[In the Smite subreddit things are pretty civil at well

The real drama however is happening in the Tribes Ascend subreddit

[The initial thread that announced the forum closing. The community is pretty pissed.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/1jr1oj/official_forums_will_close_within_24_hours_from/)

Now for the real drama storm.

[A Hi-Rez employee posts in the Tribes subreddit for the first time in months in a thread about the bad state of the game. He only responds with a sarcastic post correcting someone on the price of a microtransaction.
