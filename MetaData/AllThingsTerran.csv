The fall of GosuBuilds.,NoseKnowsAll,196,14,50,"I am no longer working on GosuBuilds for reasons that I have fully outlined in an [post in the starcraft subreddit here](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/1ehep0/the_rise_of_imbabuilds_the_fall_of_gosubuilds/).

The TL;DR copied from the above link is:

I wrote almost all of the builds on GosuBuilds. Fed up with the owner of the site only wanting money and not contributing at all, a build order site I will constantly update made exclusively for the community.

Thanks /r/AllThingsTerran for all the support and feedback you've given me throughout the year.  I've taken a lot of it into consideration and I've truly tried to make this site the best I can based on you guys' comments.  Sorry for those who have checked GosuBuilds recently and not seen any updates.  And sorry for not getting this up and running faster - I was moving home from college in the past week and things have been rather hectic.  

I'll answer any questions you might have either here

Thanks again for all your support

I have seen players play THOUSANDS of games and yet they dont really improve at a reasonable rate. With that said, this can take me some time as i will have to beta test it with candidates willing to put effort to follow the thing to see the rate of improvement and things to change. I will annouce candidates later to test it while they can give me their feedbacks and suggestion what to improve on. This is a work that is compiled by coaches

I hope this will come in great success so everyone can feel better and stronger and more confident about their play ;)

This problem, frustrated, as our attempts to damage Zergs are met with no luck. TvP is not a much better story; our brave infantry melt before the terrible, terrible damage of the protoss deathball. But such is life! I am not hear to offer an answer, or condolences. No. I can not offer you that, brothers. All I can offer is advice.

AllThingsTerran has become a breeding ground for complaints, and fight onwards. Fight the good fight. We are terrans! When we win, we know it is not because of an easy mechanic, or because we got lucky; we win when we outplay. We win when our hands leap across our keyboard, making broad, powerful strokes with our mouse, and we micro and macro our way to victory. And, you cannot deny that when that zerg or protoss type their gg's

I'll summarize what he says in the video:

It's 1-rax expand into 4-port banshee's. It's not very refined yet, but it's a great response against Zerg greed. The build is very supply intensive, it's a supply depot and a half per production cycle. Once you get 8 banshees, you 2 shot spores and it's GG. You also need to cut SCV's, so if your push fails (unlikely) you lose. 


The Build Order goes:

9 Supply
12 Rax
15 OC
16 Expand
17 Supply
18 Double Gas 
22 Bunker and 3rd Gas
@ 150/100 Factory

Even if it didn't, there's no reason that they shouldn't be allowed on either side, other than it being graphically difficult at the moment. It makes macroing in the mid to late game insanely more difficult than it is for Protoss or Zerg, who can add buildings with little to no regard for where they go, lest they be required to rearrange and lift them later

MKP's TvT build from Game 1 and Game 2.
__________________________________________

This build didn't win him the games but I thought it was a really good example of aggressive TvT utilizing a fast hellion drop into a marine/tank/banshee all in. It's intended to be aggressive but can also be used in a reactionary way imo

10 Depot

12 Rax

13 Gas

Orbital Command

Factory @ 100 gas

Take 2nd gas

2 marines and then a reactor on the barracks @ 50 gas

Swap barracks and factory and start producing 2x hellions. Also start your starport

Tech lab on barracks

After you get 4 hellions load them up in the medivac and boost them to your opponents base for a drop. Go for workers and try not to lose the hellions or medivac. 

Put the factory onto the tech lab you just built on the barracks and put the barracks onto the reactor. Also start a tech lab on the Starport for banshees or a raven.

Make marines from reactored barracks

Push out with 3 tanks

___________________________________________________________
Flash/Innovation's Reaper opening in TvZ

I've seen this build and slight variations of it a ton this weekend from Terran players. The new reaper is very fast and has a lot of potential when Zergs opt to go for a later pool.

10 Depot

12 Rax

12 Gas

16 Reaper @50 gas/OC/Depot... Also send the scv who finishes the barracks to scout and start a bunker at the natural of zerg. Don't let him die.

Harass with your first reaper

Back at home during this you should start a Command Center

Now that you have 4-6 hellions and 3 reapers you can harass a TON. Deny creep, deny expos, and just basically have complete map control. Just be sure to keep an eye on this little force and not let it get surrounded by lings or something. Innovation actually outright beat Leenock with this hellion/reaper aggression killing 3 queens and bbq'ing drones. Its very very powerful and seems incredibly fun to do! The biggest weakness to this is the zerg going fast muta, so just be mindful and use a reaper to scout! Reapers are basically Terran observers that can kill drones, so use them as such

During the reaper/hellion harass if I remember correctly we saw both players adding on a 3 CC, from this point its really what ever you want to do and is pretty much completely situational, but this is the opening which is the part to learn.

Also something to keep in mind about this opening is that Polt also did it where he went 11 rax/11 gas and proxied the Rax, its really risky because if they find the proxy or get an early drone scout in and see the 8 gas (lol) then it will be pretty hard to get the 2nd rax up like you are supposed to. So the 12/12 or 11/11 is a little safer and still has the potential to do damage. Go make Zerg's cry!
______________________________________________________

TvP Widow Mine opening

I saw this build a ton this weekend from players like Innovation, as the old standard (1rax fe into 3 rax) seems to be weak to a lot of new protoss timings. I'm sure this build is posted somewhere else, it seems to be very popular, but I'll go ahead and repost it just so I have a TvP game in here!

10 Depot

12 Barracks

15 Gas

16 Marine/Orbital Command

2 marines then reactor on the barracks

Command Center

Factory

So youll want to pump marines from the reactored barracks

You can do a drop with widow mines and marines, just make sure to plant mines in good spots if you fear these things and to throw down bunkers if you are scared. 

After your pressure the Protoss you want to start adding on additional rax, so you need to get those going asap. The plus to it is that it allows you to pressure and possibly kill a ton of workers with the mines as well is take a defensive posture if needed. :D


I didn't put supply depot timings and stuff like that, and that HOTS has a lot of awesome new options for Terran to use for harassment. I'm sure you guys have been noticing speed medivac drops are pretty goddamn good, use them! Anyway, thats just a few of the main ones I've noticed. I have more, but I'm watching VODS to make sure I have them right, I'll post more tomorrow. Hopefully these help you on ladder :D

1363592763.0,1aiiee,Compilation of MLG Dallas builds Part 2 :D,porcupinetree3,66,6,16,"Hi again

First of all I want to talk about TvP and the widow mine opening. In pretty much every TvP this weekend everyone opened up with the widow mine opening that goes like

12 Barracks

15 Gas

17 OC

Reactor on Barracks after 2 marines and then a Factory and Starport etc.
etc.etc... A popular variant of this opening is in the other thread

Well one thing I also noticed was the potential for this build to be excellent for offense and defense. Especially against builds like Blink Stalkers. A great thing about this build is that first of all you have that early reactored barracks to pump out marines to hold off MS Core pokes and stuff which were pretty common
 
This widow mine opening has some really cool aggressive options with players both trying to drop mines in mineral lines or just straight up pushing the front with marines and mines. One cool thing I thought about was dropping 1 mine in the mineral line and then boosting the medivac to quickly drop the other mine on the ramp where the probes will probably retreat
_______________________________________________

Innovation vs Flash Game 3

Hellion/Marine Elevator Opening

This series between Flash and Innovation was probably the best TvT I have ever seen. The multitasking, decision making and everything was just awesome. I highly recommend watching it if you haven't already. So in Game 3 Innovation does a really cool Marine/Hellion Elevator opening that was very powerful and at the same time not too bad on the economy. The swapping of add ons several times is also something I really liked, quite ""Innovative"" I think.

10 Depot

12 Barracks (Scout on 13)

15 Gas

16 OC/Depot/Marine

After 2 marines start a reactor on the barracks

Command Center

Factory

2x marine production from Barracks until Factory finishes

Starport after Factory finishes

(Remember to make your natural into an Orbital Command)

Once you get 4 hellions and a Medivac, sack a marine to set it off if you are worried. If your opponent isn't prepared you will do massive damage to his economy, just try not to lose all the units, make good trades if you have to trade

Back at home Innovation swapped his Barracks back onto the Reactor and started a Tech lab on the Factory for tanks. From here you could decide to all in with tanks marines and even some banshees if you want. Another thing you can do that we saw another players do in similar situations is start a Tech Lab on the Barracks as soon as you move out looking to start stim/cs soon. Let's assume we do it that way instead of the all in from here on..

So tech lab on Barracks/Widow Mines from Reactored Factory and probably add all your gas

3rd CC and 2x Engineering Bays because you will be behind on upgrades.

And add on more barracks while seeing if you can harass more with drops while also placing widow mines in good spots such as watchtowers, its up to you. Remember these are just openings, you have to play the game, not the build order. 

____________________________________________

Flash's CC First TvZ

Flash had a ton of games where he went CC first against Zerg. Here's kind of the average game of that.


10 Depot

15 Command Center(Flash opted to build it on the low ground

16 Rax

17 Gas

Factory

Orbital Commands when natural finishes on both CC's

After 2 marines start a reactor on the Barracks

Flash goes for a 3rd CC here :o

Swap factory onto reactor----&gt;Reactored Hellions

Tech Lab on Barracks

2nd Gas

Start Stim and 2 engineering bays. Use the hellions for map control and denying creep

Add on more Barracks

That's pretty much the opening
kill lings/banes that rush down a ramp at you while also having the other part of your army speeding around the map in medivacs dropping everywhere.

___________________________________________________

Polt's Reaper Expand

In Polt's games vs Creator we saw him opening up with a reaper

10 Depot

12 Barracks

13 Gas

Reaper

Orbital Command @ Main

Command Center

Depot

Tech Lab on Rax as soon as the Reaper is done

Start Stim right away and add on 2 additional Barracks

2nd gas around this time

Factory/ E-bay

Get add ons when the 2 Barracks finish

3rd Gas

Starport @100% Factory

And I mean at this point its starting to look like good old WoL TvP. You can go for the 10 minute timing attack w/ drops or pressure at the front or both. The strength of this build is allowing you to get a good read on your opponent early on at a low cost, maybe thinking there will be more coming.

Update: cast of me beating SlayerSArthur with the build: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8288cQF71w

**Concept**

The idea is simple.  You keep the Protoss economy under control and the army contained through constant Banshee harass, Banshees out of 2 Starports (very good DPS, can target fire down key units), and Marines out of 3 Barracks (mineral sink, help clean up Zealots and other Gateway units/Immortals, as well as any Stargate play).

Tired of having to double the APM of your opponent?  Well this is as close to an a-move attack as you're going to get with Terran

Disclaimer time.  The build noted below has been modified from the one I originally copied from Jjakjji.  I get gas at 15 instead of 13 so that I can get a faster expansion, but you’ll have a bigger army for the final push).  You can reverse my changes if you're so inclined.

**The Build**

This is the rough build order, and as a result I can afford to get my CC much faster at no extra risk).

10 Depot

12 Barracks (@completion 3 Marines)

14 Depot (complete wall-off to prevent scouting)

15 Refinery

17 Orbital Command

@100 gas

Second Refinery

@100 minerals

Command Centre at natural.

@Factory complete

Depot

@Starport complete, Banshee.

@100 gas

Tech Lab on Factory.

Third and Fourth Refinery.

Second Banshee.

Depot (Depots after this as necessary).

Thor.

+1 Vehicle Armour Plating (@100%

After Second Banshee

@200 spare gas

@300 spare minerals

@400 spare minerals

@~14 minutes

@~15 minutes, Banshees, Marines and 16 SCVs on auto-repair.  Secure third with PF, continue rallying units.

**The Wait**

While you wait to build up your army you should be constantly harassing with Banshees.  Send them out and kill every Probe you can, Sentries, Pylons, tech, or hell, even a Nexus.  Basically anything you can get your hands on to keep him damaged and paranoid.  When they get injured bring them back to repair, then send your every growing fleet out once more.  Do your very best not to lose any.

**Dealing with Aggression**

There's a chance that a Protoss will try to hit you with a 1 or 2 base all-in before you do your push.  In the case of 1 base all-ins, something fishy).  If it looks like a 3 or 4 gate, stay up your ramp and bunker.  You win.  If it looks like a Blink, Void or Warp Prism play, you may want to also go for a Thor before the Starport since otherwise you risk a build order loss (with Thor first you can either expand as normal, or try a 1 base Thor all-in, depending on how you feel).

For 2 base all-ins, keep your units from wandering too far from the wall, and snipe down anything that you can (including obs).  You may want to get Strike Cannon earlier to snag Immortals or Colossus, but dealing with this sort of thing will come with experience.  If you hold it off without nearly dying (even if they don't lose all that much), you should be able to walk over them easily with your push.

The 15 gas build as I do it only really has 1 weakness - a fast 1gate FE into 3 or 4 gate.  If executed correctly this should hit before Cloak is done or a Thor is out, and repair until your Banshee is out.  5, 6, 7 or 8 gates, on the other hand, should be a build order win since they have no detection.

**The Engagement**

For the most part the engagement is an a-move affair

First, but if he has a lot of ranged units, Immortals or Storm, you’ll want to meet somewhere you can get a concave or your Thors will just be dancing about and not firing.  If he doesn’t come out to meet you it will depend somewhat on the map.  The key is that you don’t want to take too long getting into his production, because you don’t want to marginally win the battle and then lose to reinforcements.  So on a map like Cloud Kingdom I’ll go through the third (assuming he has one) because it’s basically on the way to the natural anyway, but on maps like Daybreak or Entombed I’ll go straight to the natural so that I can go for the kill rather than cripple.

Second

Third

Fourth

Fifth, etc.  This can be tricky, but most Protosses don’t get Storm.

**The Aftermath**

When it comes down to it, as you moved out you did get that third base up and mining (hopefully with both Refineries), so if you attack and do some good damage (maybe take out the army and third or something) but don't manage to get the killing blow, then you should be able to reload and take another swing soon after – and with the additional income you can invest in some more tech, upgrades, production, or whatever you want.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/10k3n5/2_base_tvp_guide_marinethorbanshee/

To start off I'd like to address how the average ladder player (maybe you!) will confront playing on the ladder. ""I really want to improve, what do I do? I guess I'll just keep playing and things will get better"" This is true, no matter what if you just play the game you will get better, even if by the slightest amount. However this is not the correct way to approach improving in SC2, if you want faster macro, faster APM, you have to know what you're doing. It's all about the game plan

Essentially

This is the most important part in SC2 macro/mechanics. If you throw down 4 more raxes is that enough for a 3 base economy? What about upgrades when do I put those down, and there's over thousands of these in SC2. 

This brings me to the next point of, when he's at the enemy base I can guarantee you that his +1/stim/combat shield will all finish at the same time, and that his 3rd base will align to get him enough gas for his +3/+3 upgrades 10 minutes later into the game. This of course really isn't that complicated, it just requires /focused/ practice. 

All it takes is a look at your replay, Up to the highest level of play (and even then) the strategy isn't complicated, 95% of games end with a ""o I'll drop here and.. maybe send my army at a seperate base... and well there's a win I guess"" 

As long as you find a build you can improve with (a standard macro focused build

Conclusion: Too many people make Starcraft out to be much harder than it really is, look at the replay and never lose to it again, don't just rage-reque you'll never learn. Finally; if you really want to improve stop doing all-ins, you will seriously never improve in the long term if you just 8/8/8 every game, it will give you short-term happiness but long-term depression! 

Don't fall for the prostitute reaper cheeses! Macro will be harder in the short term

P.S: People like Polt have ""relatively"" low APM but extremely high EPM which is why I wanted to make sure it came across that game plan = EPM not just spam click APM

This ended up being a lot longer than I was planning

This is my first ever post on /r/starcraft, added to the fact that Terran is now so easy to roll over with the two other races.

Personally, I worked my way out of bronze (I started at the beginning of season 2) and since the end of season 5, I have been in mid/high masters. I am a Zerg, and I remember the majority of the matches first few matches I played against Terran, I would usually think ""Terran is just imba and broken"". This was at the time that Terran was dominating the professional scene, and I was myself terribly frustrated by Terran strats and build orders that would just tear me apart. I would watch the GSL, MLG's and many other tournaments and in the initial months of the year 2011, this trend has been severely reversed ever since the Terran race has constantly been nerfed

As far as I can recall, Thorzain’s two base mech against Protoss), there would be a wave of balance whine within the community, and instead of players searching how to counter these strategies, they would simply wait for blizzard’s nerf. The Terran ghost nerf was the icing on the Terran nerf cake, seeing as the ghost was the only Terran unit that could deal with T v Z late game tech switches (Ultralisks and Broodlords), which now leaves the Terran race stuck with the same army composition throughout the late game

Regarding engaging battles, and where the zerg can easily a-move his zerg lings/ultralisks/banelings and fungal the Terran army to stop him for microing, the Terran has to be patient and spread his siege tanks, spread his unit to avoid spells such as fungal growth, storm and force field that rip the Terran army to shreds. Even with all this micro, the Terran is not always assured to win the battle, and countless times have I seen games where a Terran wins all the fights in the mid game/late game with good micro and has a solid macro behind, because if due to one micromanagement mistake they lose all their army

Many Images and Professional interviews merely echo my thoughts:
The recent “Terran Holocaust Image” - 

http://img837.imageshack.us/img837/2509/tgth.jpg

DongRaeGu’s MLG winner Interview – But Z v T became…as long as I don’t make a mistke – regardless of whether my opponent plays well or not – as long I don’t make a mistake

MarineKingPrime’s Idea of Balance - 

https://twitter.com/MKPS2/status/210345589035114499

Even if these sources are select, and that this high skill race does not always offer high reward.

I am sure some of you already know what i am talking about. For those who have no idea what this is

http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/1b6f8z/hi_i_will_be_attempting_to_create_the_p90x/

Just for summary, they get more out of it), it will also help lower level players improve instead of wasting countless hundreds to thousands of game with no direction or aim, and it will help those who need good coaching but cant afford it. Just remember this program isnt a ""Automatic i will get better"" guide... Just like a normal workout program, you only benefit it if you actually attempt it and try. And obviously the more time you invest, the more you get in return. 

I have not tested this with anyone yet (Meaning this isnt a complete thing yet). The beta test of the program generally covers the first 7 days. I have so far been working on the 5th day, you wont get the full benefits as if its a complete product. If anything, it will ""spoil"" you and give improper direction of improvement as a possibility. So please be aware what you are getting yourself into. If you are seriously into this to get the most out of it, you should wait till after its complete.

The test subjects i will require are gold, suggestions, improvements, and any form of feedback needed to change the program. There possibly will be gramatical and spelling errors, etc. If anyone is interested in ""spicing up"" the quality such as better picture, format of how the folder are organized, grammer check

Please post below your league, best and worst matchup, and style of play if you are interested in taking part of the program. I will need alot of feedback to make MAJOR MAJOR adjustments to make sure everything perfectly works. Those who are taking part in this test should be serious about this and not take it as if its about fun or sense of self improvement. You guys are part of a group that will help many players improve to great lengths to make sure we kick protoss and zerg ass. Their tears will empower us. I hope everyone read this carefully and good luck.

And i need to figure out where i can upload this beta version in the meantime. The official version (When its ready) will be on my team's website.

* You do NOT have to all-in protoss in order to win the late game.  Instead
* Delay ghosts in favor of more medivacs/vikings/bio.  With more pure ARMY
* With a larger army
* **YOUR GOAL SHOULD BE TO DENY YOUR OPPONENT'S THIRD FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.** Polt every single game he played was capable of denying protoss their third until at least 3 minutes after he got his third.  This is because he was heavily committing to army and multi-pronged attacks.  At some point
* Don't overcommit to any one attack.  The easiest way to lose is ball up everything and just go for it.  However
* Remember that medivacs are fast.  You can 99% of the time just get everything out of there by loading up into the medivacs and just boosting away.

a. When loading units into bunkers

b. When loading units into Medivacs

**2) Select Current Worker (I have this bound to Q):**

I find this helps eliminate the step of specificaly selecting workers from your constructing buildings and rallying them to a new position (typically the mineral line). For example, I'll just add the Barracks to my Production Control Group (I keep Rax, Factories, and Ports all on 4), press ""4"" then ""Q"" and it will select all the units that are constructing buildings in that current selection. This is also great for Supply Depot SCVs as well, as they are often strewn around your base. I Ctrl + Click the Depots, press ""Q"" and then I have all those SCVS selected.

**3) The ""Choose Ability or A.I. Target"" has much more depth than people give it credit.** You can use this for ANY ability,"" your sniper round and heat seaker missiles are now selected AND casted with the same key: ""R"". This means you can just hover your cursor over a unit or group of units and hold down ""R"" to cast it repeatedly. But what you can also do is press ""E"" for mules, then hold Shift + R and they will drop wherever your mouse cursor is until you let go.

**4) Lowering and Raising Depots can be bound to 2 different hotkeys.** I use ""R"" for Raise and ""Z"" for lower.

**5) Medivacs follow the Last In -&gt; First Out priority system.** So if you load up 6 Marines followed by a Widow Mine

**6) When adding your additional SCV's to gas**, but press ""C"" before they get there and they will return the minerals, and then head to the refinery.

&gt;Some Zerg tells that a 2 base all-in or 2 base tech aren't often what you initially think - I don't have a list of VODs, you can check for a lot of things.

&gt;I'll start with the SCV scout, which isn't the initial thought as the pool is slightly later.

&gt;Our 2 base plays, MAYBE one if the zerg doesn't inject as well or has a slightly different build order.

&gt;Hyun has a early Roach pressure build that is the next earliest thing to worry about. We can open standard, its a play designed to kill SCVs (most pressure builds are). There will also be a flood of 3 overlords at once, so if you see a group of overlords leaving our base at once instead of one at a time, this can also be a tell for a roach pressure (they require a lot of supply!). The initial batch should hatch around 6:00, and it should be 12~ in number. This is why I like making a marauder first (and sometimes second) out of my tech lab rax when I play terran.

&gt;Pressures or all-ins after this time can include a roach baneling attack, you can think about sac-ing some SCVs in order to stay alive, otherwise try to avoid it! More marauders and bunkers, and ideally siege tanks will stop these dead in their tracks.

&gt;Scouting the 2 base all-ins without seeing them can be awkward, as I have all the drones I need"". Dropping a scan at 7:20ish can help you if you're super unsure.

&gt;6 minutes is when a standard macroing Zerg will place their 3rd base (assuming no reaper) and additional geysers

&gt;As for 2 base tech, mutalisks finish at 9:13 and they're in your base at 10:00. Infestors will also be out at a similar time to the Mutalisks, but if you scout a 2 base infestation pit you should also be aware of 2 base Swarm Host Nydus (I don't think this is very good vs Terran personally).

&gt;In summary, 3+ is still possible but it could go either way), no evo chambers at the front to deny hellions (I don't need upgrades for what I want to do), continued mining gas even in front of your SCV/reaper (I really need gas for what I want to do), spawning pool NOT wiggling after 100 gas is mined (I don't need this gas for speed), spurt of aggressive units around 7:25 (I'm saturated, now time to do SOMETHING!)

&gt;I think that mostly covers it... if you want to practice on EU with me

The Trainning program is now open beta using the next version of the guide v0.30. Note: that this is beta and a incomplete product, i had lazy people who had no devotion who just wanted to see the guide hoping its some auto win stuff to get them better but its not. Its literally an instruction manuel like a unspoken coach telling you wat to do to improve. Its up to your own efforts and hard work to get there. This is merely a blue print or a map to your sucess to reach your destination.. i can only show you the way.

The next version will have details on the news section of the group. As of now there are only 6 days of the program and it mainly touches TvT. v0.30 will have up to day 10 planned.

**F&amp;Q**

* I can take part in the test?

A: Yes you may take part in the test regardless of league. I will need input from all leagues and skill level

* How should i help?

A: You the thing seriously as if your entire days worth of play is this. You follow it and not half-ass it. The guide is only is as good as the reader who tries it (Same logic as the weapon to the user). After completing each version, needs to be changed, and what you feel comfortable/uncomfortable about.

* I just want to be in the group to see the guide's progress rather than test it

A: Then you came to the wrong place

* Will this cost money?

A: No its free. I will only accept donations at the most. If possible

* I already did the initial beta test

A: You can choose either. But look at the changelog carefully since previous days WILL BE MODIFIED thus changing your entire experience.

* Should i wait till its a complete product to do this or should i have a head start doing it?

A: Wait till its a complete product. If you attempt this when its complete, helping depressed/frustrated noobs, and the whole terran race.

* What skill level should i be before taking part of this test?

A: I highly recommend MINIMUM GOLD LEAGUE. Do not bother if you are bronze or silver unless you are completely desperate. Its not an easy program but it will def show the way how to play.

* I got promoted due to this incomplete guide

1339646266.0,v13iw,Three Very Powerful TvZ Builds,Aristherius,43,3,17,"I've noticed a lot of Terrans having trouble lately with their vs Zerg

WARNING: These builds are pretty APM/ Multitasking intensive, all I did was just go into Marine Split Challenge (map by Griffith) and just do it for a couple days non stop until I could finally do it right.

Enough dragging- onto the builds!

**FIRST BUILD: 1 Rax FE into Hellion Banshee into Standard Marine Tank Medivac.**

This is a very useful build (my go to standard) that essentially lets you hold every single early allin and get a monster economy with monster upgrades with monster map control (get it? MONSTER.)

BO:

I'll just list the standard 1rax FE here (well

9 supply (you can scout here

12 Barracks

16 Orbital, you can make the second depot before the CC but I find it makes no difference so I just go CC first)

And that's it for 1Rax FE!

This is where the build changes a bit.

Get double gasses either before or after the second depot

Make the factory when you have the gas by the Barracks

when the CC finishes, or have it by the CC to stop early runbys but risk it not reaching the ramp)

From now on

When the factory is done, and make a techlab with the rax for the incoming starport. When the techlab is done on the rax, lift it and make a reactor with it. Pump marines from it afterwards.


Start an engineering bay around 7

Make hellions up until you have six

Send your hellions to clear the watchtowers, make sure you micro like hell and kill as many lings as possible. If you lose them to roaches, that's stupid because you can outrun them.

You should also start two additional barracks' around half way the banshee (you should have the money). Put a techlab on one (stim immediately) and reactor on the other. Pump marines constantly.

Now then, start double medivacs and tanks with siege. Grab your natural gasses at this time.

The banshee is the true beauty of this build. This baby will BLOCK EVERY ALLIN THEY SEND AT YOU. Seriously, and does everything. THIS IS WHY YOU MUST NEVER EVER LOSE IT. I like to do a light poke with it at their main to scout any funky things, but never ever commit to an attack with it other than a couple of free drones. With this banshee, you completely deny their map vision. Simply keep it (or patrol between if more than one tower) at the tower, and you single handedly deny everything they see (other than overlord in your base.)

If you sense or see an impending allin coming from your zerg opponent (for some reason zergs try to allin 1 rax fe to punish it, rebuild, laugh at them, and send your banshee back to the towers or stay at home if you feel another wave is coming.

Now then, if your hellions are still alive they're now with your army, and your army should consist of a lot of combat shield marines with +1, tanks with siege, and around 4-5 medivacs. Build a 4th and 5th barracks, second engi bay, armory

Unless he doesn't have one

This is where things either get complicated or laughably easy. If they have mutas, especially banelings (this requires lots of practice, and this build also relies a lot on marine splitting).

If they went Infestors however, I always just split on the spot. Whenever I get close or sense an engagement, I just split. This is also why this build relies a lot on splitting. When the engagement eventually comes, you should be split and use your tanks to focus down the infestors (this is really really good for you.) 

At this point, or they steamrolled your army and you didn't kill the third (gg)(I also don't know how this happens if they didn't see your attack coming.) 

Generally if I kill their third, and then kill him, simply because 2 base zerg just can't hold a marine tank push like yours.

Anyways, upgrades for tanks, and make more barracks' and factories, and whatever you need to do.

Pros: Banshee for map control

Cons: Pretty weak without a decent ability to split

**SECOND BUILD: Polt's Marine Marauder Hellion Timing Attack**

In my opinion

BO: Standard 1 Rax Fe with double gasses

Instead of making a starport this time, double produce hellions ( you don't have to constantly because you won't have enough income, I tend to have around 5-6 by the 10 minute mark) and make a techlab on the rax, with stim started and marauder production. With the other two raxxes, make a techlab and reactor. Start Combat Shields, and double pump marauders and marines. 

This force will also hold most early allins (except for 1 base bane bust)

By the 9-10 minute mark, so he shouldn't have a clue this is coming. Once again, hit the third.

While you move out, Engi bay (2), and armory. 

The things is, but this works for me anyways because they still don't have mutas or fungal to properly deal with an on the spot splitting MMH force with stim and shields. You also need to stim very conservatively, because you don't have medivacs. Only stim when you ABSOLUTELY NEED TO, such as an engagement. Otherwise, try your best to stay away from stimming.

If you killed their third

From here, medivacs, and lift your 3rd orbital and grab it. It plays out like a standard TvZ after this, but you should have a big advantage. This doesn't mean you should turtle either if you killed their third base, get a couple of more units and just kill them.

Pros: Strong timing

Cons: Requires hellions to stay alive so constantly pay attention to them

## Disclaimer

I completely acknowledge that 2rax pressure may not work for upper diamond and above. This is just something for fellow low level Terrans to ponder. 

## The build

12/14 rax into expand, or you're forfeiting any advantage you may have gained. I get double gases ASAP after I throw down the expansion. 

## Why it seems to work

### Zergs are lazy with overlords

It amazes me how many Zergs are no longer keeping an Overlord in a good position to spot bunkers. 

### Zergs forgot how to micro

In the last 10 games I've done this, didn't know when to pull away. Overall, their early game micro is very sloppy. Mediocre stutter step micro goes very far. 


### Their first instinct is predictable. 

The Zerg will generally assume you've over-commited (make sure you don't!). Their natural response is to baneling bust you. This is why we grab double gas after the expand: We can have tanks out and ready before they bust us. 


### Zergs in general tend to go full retard once they see the first marine and SCV

1. A single seeker missle takes out all larva at a hatchery

2. A-moving zerg units don't target auto-turrets when there is any other attacking unit nearby. IE
     This can also be used during battle to either create a wall to run around or mess with Banelings that do not have building attack enabled either.

3. The auto-turret does more dps than an unstimmed +2 Marine

4. This doesn't matter as much in a normal game but building armor reduces queen DPS vs turrets to less than 2 (150 health

5. Seeker missles accellerate once they are within 1~2 range of the target

6. The only units that ravens really suck vs TvZ are Ultralisks and Roaches. Thankfully as we covered before auto-turrets are good for harass if they don't go broodlord infestor.

7. Contrary to popular belief

8. After 4 in-game minutes a 15 hatch will have just finished 99% of games you play. This is the lifespan of a durable material auto-turret(use upgrades wisely!).

So I spent all of my Saturday watching and re watching VODS and copying build orders from Sting, and YoDa the four Terran players that made it out of their groups.

Here are the notes that I took.

Sorry if you can't read my handwriting

I wasn't planning on sharing these notes but there were some really cool and *new* builds being put on display. Also these are just a few builds I picked to copy there are different variations of a lot of these builds that the same players used. 

Hope some people find these useful.

This is Bomber's TvZ build

1.	10 Depot
2.	12 Rax
3.	(Simultaneous) – 16 Orbital Command
4.	Command Center # 2 Started ASAP
5.	@ 50 Gas
6.	@ 100 Gas
7.	After Factory
8.	@ 100 % Factory
9.	Build 2 Hellions. At Hellions 80 – 90 %
10.	 At around the 7:00 min mark
11.	 After sufficient hellion number has been reached (2 – 6)
12.	 At around the 8:30 mark
13.	 At +1/+1 50%
14.	 Start Rax # 4 and Rax # 5 at roughly 9:00 (2 and 3 not even done yet).
15.	 At around this time, a bunker, and a tank.
16.	 Throughout this whole time, scvs, and depot wall offs. If spire is scanned, a few turrets are not a wasted investment.
17.	 Begin Stim research a little past 10:00.

18.	As soon as 2-2 begins researching, 7, 8, start Factory (Tech Lab) # 2, Start Starport (Reactor) # 1, get combat shield, and research level one vehicle weapons at armory.

19.	 Once the two gasses at the third are done

20.	 Round out build with Rax #s 9 and 10. Final projected addons for Rax should be 7 reactors

21.	 At this point, and medivacs two at a time.

22.	 Attack at 14 min. Protect tanks with marines, but drops should take out tech buildings if possible, esp greater spire, baneling nest, and infestation pit.


I would like to point a few things out: although Day9 markets this as a 3 base all in

The weaknesses to this build are quite obvious: a good zerg player will make establishing your third a nightmare, although your early tanks should stop any baneling busts. But if you get roach dropped before your production kicks in, just gracefully GG out.

She started playing WoL about a year ago when I first met her, playing for hours and hours each day. She grinds out ladders not to get better, but BECAUSE IT'S FUN. Does she know any builds? Nope. Does she care? not at all. Expo at optimal times? micro? macro? benchmarks? 50 scvs? nope nope nope nope nope. She simply plays because it's fun. Win or lose. She's had 0 RTS experience, and yet it's so fun to her. She grabs rich minerals because ""oooh it's so pretty"" and she constantly builds supply depots, way past 200 supply, because she ""likes building them."" Xel'Naga towers? ""pretty towers."" She doesn't watch streams, she doesn't look up strategies and discussions, SHE JUST PLAYS.

What I'm trying to say is this. A lot of times we stress over a lot of things, you can tell that some of us are just really anxious and nervous about the multiplayer aspect, particularly losing, and we want to learn the game inside and out before we even hit that 'Find Match' button. You don't have to! Just go out and play, and you'll learn all that on your own! I know how frustrating it gets to lose, but when you start playing a lot, you'll start having fun, and you'll improve a shit ton. So just go out there and play. You absolutely have to play in order to improve... and you also absolutely have to play to begin with

With HotS out, then trust me you will climb that ladder eventually. You can always reach out to the community for help or questions.

*Plat-Diamond:* Open up a custom game and practice maxing by 14 minutes on a decent unit composition. Learn to use positional hotkeys on at least your first 3 bases. It takes some getting used to


**TvP:**
Below diamond

Diamond+: Get the 10 minute push down perfectly. Practice ghost control in darglein's micro trainer. Learn to be spot on with upgrades or you might end up having 1/1 or worse when toss comes with his 3/3 push. Drop liberally


**TvZ:**
Below diamond:
Practice the [bomber build](http://day9.tv/d/Day9/day9-daily-530/) taught in a day9 daily. It's a solid way to max by the 14/15 minute mark. Your mechanics and macro needs to develop more before you try builds like hellion banshee. If you can do the build decently without macro slip ups

Diamond+:Bomber build is still great. If you choose to do builds like hellion banshee make sure that you control units effectively and continue expanding/producing in the background. Too much focus on micro will cause you to lose the game. Not enough focus on micro will cause you to lose the game. Be careful using higher level builds that are multi tasking intensive.


**TvT:**
Below diamond:
Play a safe defensive style. Scout for gas and expansions. Use scans liberally. The TvP 10 minute push will win you most games if executed properly. Learn good missile turret placements.

Diamond+:
Don't be over eager to end the game. Scout well (gas/expos) and be one step ahead of your opponent. Make sure to leave marines at his third and along attack paths he can take. Liberally use missile turrets and sensor towers. A safe defensive style with good information gathering is the best way to win TvT. The actual build you open with is stylistic

Tanks in TvZ are gotten to deal with infestors and banelings so that your marines can be protected. However

Before I further expand on why I feel that tanks are bad (generally) in TvZ

But the reality of TvZ is that tanks are often overrun by zerglings in the mid game and fair *horribly* against ultralisks and brood lords in the late game. Tanks in the midgame can easily be replaced by marauders and an increased medivac count, and a fleet of medivacs, pure bio becomes way more cost efficient than marine/tank. 

The advantages are obvious. You don't have to upgrade your tanks (since you aren't making any, the late game broodlord or ultralisk transition is no longer scary. Broodlords can be easily countered by a switch to vikings, exactly as you would with tanks. Tanks are very bad against ultralisks because of the inability of your tanks to splash them. The fact that marauders are already out makes that transition very simple to deal with.

As time has gone on Zerg has gotten pretty good at defending Reapers

Zergs still expect Reapers, and you have a solid build behind it, the Zerg is left miles behind just a couple of minutes into the game.

To do this you will need 2 Marines after your Barracks finishes.

Below is a rough guide of some ladder maps where I frequently kill off their first Overlord -- and sometimes their second too.

[Disclaimer: in my limited experience

**Akilon Wastes**

Success rate on first Overlord: 90%+

Success rate on second Overlord: ~25%

Normal Overlord paths: http://i.imgur.com/rmQNHB0.jpg

As the figures suggest this is the best map to go hunting on.  There are two paths that nearly every single Zerg uses

The first task is to find out which route he's going.  I do this by sending my scouting SCV (after the Barracks completes) on a slight detour to check for the non-natural-bound Overlord.  If it's there, the Marines will head to kill the one heading for the natural.

In the case of the natural you'll need to position one Marine to cover whatever high ground it's heading towards and one to cover the low ground.  In the case of the other path you might need to rally the second Marine to the natural

Most Zergs will go for the natural first.  If they do

**Derelict Watcher**

Success rate on first Overlord: 90%+

Success rate on second Overlord: 5-10%

Normal Overlord paths: http://i.imgur.com/2l4ZirN.jpg

The first Overlord will almost always be sent to the natural here.  Again

I will usually send my first Marine to scout the third

If you kill it quickly as it heads to your natural you can head over to the void that the other Overlord should pass over.  By putting one Marine on each side (or finding it nearby) you can sometimes get a bonus kill.

**Newkirk Redevelopment Precinct**

Success rate on first Overlord: ~10%

Success rate on second Overlord: ~1%

Normal Overlord paths: http://i.imgur.com/CDJj9xo.jpg

This is a tricky one

I'll send my scouting SCV (after Barracks) to check the path towards the natural

If it's heading to your main you'll want to send your first Marine to the expansion with the rocks, you can pin it and kill it before it gets into dead space.

**Star Station**

Success rate on first Overlord: ~5%

Success rate on second Overlord: ~0%

Normal Overlord paths: http://i.imgur.com/e3v3fwz.jpg

There's really only one direction the first Overlord goes here, which allows me to kill it easier later on when it's trying to scout.

You can get this kill every time if you're willing to make some small sacrafices yourself (which I will likely start doing in the future).  For example, and he got the kill from that.

**Other Maps**

The other maps are difficult because they're either 4 player or small enough to get somewhere safe before the Marines can do their work.  But there's no doubt some damage you can do if you experiment a bit.  For example

 I don't agree, if that was the _only_ thing they focused on. Well, rather than babble back and forth, let's just put this to the test and that's where I need your help ATT. The question is, how close to ideal (Bomber) can players from different leages get, if _all_ they focus on is Macro? Well to test this out we need players from every league.

I need 3 Volunteers

* 1 from Gold ([CannedBeef](http://www.reddit.com/user/CannedBeef) is our first volunteer
* 1 from Platinum ([Shalashaka1022](http://www.reddit.com/user/Shalashaka1022) is our first volunteer)
* 1 from Master league ([NoseKnowsAll](http://www.reddit.com/user/NoseKnowsAll) is our first volunteer) 

I will be doing this at Diamond league level. Obviously if more people want to try it out

**THE EXPERIMENT**

So I have been provided with a Bomber replay from [yomcool](http://www.reddit.com/u/yomcool) where he takes almost no economical damage. 

[REPLAY HERE](http://drop.sc/187497)

The goal of the test subjects is then to as best as possible match the build

The final game should be played on Daybreak LE against a very easy AI. The AI should not bother you

We will compare the performance of the test subjects at the 5

I'll update this thread with any data that you add. 

So

**THE BUILD**

Rather than post a really long

A short description for someone familiar with Terran builds is that it's a 1 depot 1 rax expand, add second engi bay and armory when +1 attack is finished and then just keep building units/scvs until about 12-13 minutes, then you add Ghost academy and 3 more rax.

After he counters, things stop looking so standard; I respond with many drops.  The game goes crazy from here and there is a very tense build up where I am always on the brink of defeat.

1rax FE, 2 more rax, double gas, techlab, stim, double reactor, factory

Basically the same as all other TvPs.  So how is he getting 100+ supply by 9 minutes?  

* His depot walloff =&gt; he has constant marine production =&gt; he doesn't need a bunker to deal with the first zealot/stalker =&gt; he can get his 2rax and double gas earlier.  Skipping this bunker means he kick starts all upgrades and the rest of his play around 10ish seconds earlier than if he hadn't skipped the bunker ([Citation Needed] but you get the point).  
* He starts 2 reactors on his barracks and he does it BEFORE his factory.  This means that he can start serious marine production VERY quickly

Ok that makes sense.  So why is this actually not as good as everyone here thinks it is?

* Starting the CC after 2nd depot =&gt; 2 less SCVs than you would otherwise have had.  You have a slightly smaller economy than normal 1rax FE.  He kickstarts his upgrades and rest of his play sooner
* If an early 1 base allin comes (read: 4gate) like what Sase and Grubby have shown capable of doing
* His reactors early means HE CAN'T MAKE ANY MARINES UNTIL THOSE THINGS FINISH.  Again
* His reactors early means his factory is 100 gas later.  This means his push is around 30seconds later.  Thus, it hits with more punch than earlier factory builds, but notice how every single game he did it vs normal collo timings, his opponent already had their first collo done and their second half-way done.

Just had to say this now before you guys get all out-of-hand.  He's doing things in a different order than what other people have been doing recently

1351297351.0,125hl5,Thoughts After a year break from a former Masters T,DrNgo,34,3,21,"Hello

I was a former Terran Masters player. I stopped playing around July of last year. Basically I got burned out from too much SC2. Laddering, etc. 

Anyways I picked up the game again and thought I'd share my experience after 3 days back. 

I had a LOT of rust the first day. What was surprising is my muscle memory remembered all of my hotkeys. I forgot my builds and my macro's pretty horrible now. I did my placement matches and landed in Silver. 

About 50 matches later I'm now in high platinum. 

The game plays very differently vs zerg now. Before it was zerg

I'm opening with the popular gasless fast expand into hellions / banshees. Amazing opener. The hardest part is when the zerg gets really aggressive before my banshee comes out. 

TvP feels pretty much the same as before. Quite a boring an predictable match up. I saw some videos Byun goes for a dual prong attack with hellions and marines that I'm looking forward to trying out.  

TvT. Is going mech still viable? When I stopped playing I remember blue flame hellions were all the rage. This was always my weakest matchup and I was able to succeed by playing MKP bio style. Now I'm in platinum I'm going to take the time to learn more standard styles with tanks and banshees.

I started watching some pros play

I kinda like how Terran's ""underpowered."" I love TvZ's and look forward to more of them as I move up. 

I definitely like the map pool selection now. Looks like they finally got rid of metalopolis and xel naga. Also I like how a lot of the maps are designed for 1v1 with set spawn locations. 

Downloading a lot of Taeja replays!

Anyways that's all. I did think about a race switch before I came back

- Drop play
- Micro intensive. I love shutter stepping with rines and banshees
- Highest skill cap level to get ""good"" with
- I hate watching ZvZ and PvP

Ok, just like Carriers and thus not very viable before 30 minute mark. 

Especially in TvZ, Blinding Cloud + Fungal combo, or even speed Hydras? And since they get Swarm Host it's going to be even harder to brake them mid game.

TvP? It was hard enough to win while unharrased, Oracles will reduce your mineral income to 0 and unless you kill Protoss, you die to a counterattack. You'd have to put Turrets around every mineral line, but it's ~800-1000 Minerals to get fully protected on 2 bases, depending on the map. 1000 Minerals is 20 Marines/10 Marauders. If you lose that much army, you can't go with a timing either. 

After watching some streams, what is even more stupid, the only top tier Terrans who got invite are ForGG, DeMu and Illusion.

The screen shot is from one of my games where I went mech yesterday before I realized the changes had been implemented.  You can see that I have 24 damage with an extra + 3 vs. light from my +3 vehicle attack upgrades.

Each upgrade gives +2 damage with a bonus +1 vs. light

I made a post about this in /r/starcraft yesterday asking if people thought this was a bug or intended with the new change....  for some reason people felt the need to downvote it.

I'd like to bring it up and ask the same kind of question to ATT.

Do you think this is a bug or intended?  

It doesn't make a huge difference one way or the other... but I find it very strange.   You have a unit that has no bonus damage to light (without blue flame)

It's clearly a carry over of how the upgrades worked before this change

[Flash vs effOrt - Proleague Round 5](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8Sys-NFzOQ)

**My thoughts**

This build is much less forgiving than 3 cc builds vs standard zerg play. If you micro badly - you will lose your army cost inefficiently and not have the better economy from 3cc builds to make up for it. Also

However

So if you're losing a lot with 3cc - try this build out and enjoy learning a new style :).

This build seems to be designed to apply an early pressure on a zerg who go for 6 queens and 3 hatchs without gas. I tried to use it and it worked pretty well in some situations.

But first you need to scout your oppponent and to be sure that he doesn't go for a fast speedgling or a roach/ling all-in! So you can scout him after he started his first hatch to see  if he takes one gas

If he doesn't go for a fast gas

CC first or fast CC after your first barrack.

Add 2 barracks (to be on 3 racks).

Take 2 gas

At 25 gas go for a tech lab on one of your racks

At 100 gas go for combat shield on this tech lab.

Keep producing scv and marines/marauders, and if he doesn't take a 3rd you can force as many units as possible until go back to your base.

The goal of this build is to force the zerg to build units or even kill his 3rd if he isn't ready.

After that build you can transition into 1 EB, siege tank, add 2 racks and go for a more normal game.

Those are skypes.

Hello everyone

I have been playing starcraft for around 1 year now

I had a few jams, with little wins. I was on massive tilt.

I would never have gotten out of that tilt and into masters if it werent for two amazing people. They coached me for hours and taught me everything I needed to know. I owe them my masters promotion.

I want to pay back the community

A few things beforehand

* My coaching is FREE 

* You should listen to me. I think I know what I'm talking about. I do not know alot, and micro/macro. 

I'm not good with wording
You go on skype, and help with macro/terran in general. You ignore my advice, and continue to do whatever you wish, and say I am wrong, etc. 

* I do not know everything. I am not good

* My styles are NOT all ins. I do not like all in/cheese and feel you should never do them if you want to improve. For improving you should do the 1 build I give you for each match up

* I play extremely macro-heavy with smart aggression. 

Anyways

I am EST time zone


**Slur.918** is my Game/Code

**Slur.660** is my EU game/code 

**MGInfinite.933** is my KR game/code

I will almost always be on NA. I do not like EU for practice because they do alot of cheese on ladder.

The main way to contact me for coaching

**SKYPE - ColonelSlur**
This is how we will talk, you can send replays over skype or upload them to drop.sc and I will watch them with you. You can msg me on skype anytime and I will respond asap (on DnD most of the time)

**REDDIT - ColonelSlur**

You can PM me here anytime and I can answer questions.

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE have practice partners beforehand

**Diamond+ Practice** - This is an SC2 IN GAME CHANNEL that Diamond+ can join

**http://www.reddit.com/r/sc2partners/** - This is a VERY good subreddit. You just make a post

Please please PLEASE keep in mind that I am in no way good. I am only mid masters, so please listen. 

I WILL ONLY COACH PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE GENUINE DESIRE TO IMPROVE. Please do not give up. You can do it , you just need to set those aside and improve. People will help you. I will help you. We all know terran is a bit funky atm, but you can NOT give up or cry. Remember, there are people that improve very much as terran. All match ups are more or less balanced (in mid masters).

The match ups are all depended on the Terran. If you can micro/macro

Terran is the most powerful race. Toss/zerg have very little of a skill cap. Toss can just a move/storm, win, or destroy. If you are good, you will win. 

In my observations

AKA toss learns colossi/storm but terran does not have ghost control at that moment.

zergs know how to fungal effectively but terrans do not know focus fire/dropping.

Lastly, but here are some VERY good streams to watch, to improve:

http://www.twitch.tv/xenocidersc2 : amazing analysis and commentary

http://www.twitch.tv/pepsi29 : High masters terran

http://www.twitch.tv/nathanias : very fun player while teaching you how to play

http://www.twitch.tv/quanticillusion : very good terran who commentates occasionally and has interesting styles

http://www.twitch.tv/ispyre : commentates and is a really good macro player

http://www.twitch.tv/mindfeast123 : very high masters terran player who commentats. 

http://www.twitch.tv/isxl : me streaming my lessons

**TL;DR : Mid masters terran will help/coach/become a mentor to anyone

&gt;to avoid fungal

A battle between roaches and marines is going to end either way. You should be building.

 I know this is pretty common knowledge; but I told myself I wasnt watching my units die. I was. Ive made an effort to not do that and it caused me to beat builds that were otherwise dominating me. It has helped me stop all ins.

If Bomber can beat MC with this flat out

http://www.redbullusa.com/cs/Satellite/en_US/001243035003218

Download the replay there

So here it goes:

10 Depot

12 Rax - Orbital immediately after rax

16 CC on lowground. This is at around 3 minutes

16 Depot

19 Bunker

21 2nd rax

23 - 3rd rax

24 - take a single gas

38 or when tech lab finishes - take second gas

Stim @ 100 gas - this is at around 40 supply

Factory @ 100 gas this is around 50 supply

Your E-bay comes out right after the factory.

You should have 32 scvs at 7 minutes with good macro.

Get +1 as soon as ebay is done and starport as soon as factory is done. Also get a reactor on the factory.

When you get the gas

Start marauders now

Double gas at natural after second tech lab.

Get a reactor on the plain rax

Get 2 more rax and produce double marauders.

Get 2 medivacs then when you can combat shield then Conc. Shell.

Push when two medivacs pop

Rally to base if necessary

I use the three rax timing push


Edit: Something else to note, Bomber, being the confidant guy he is doesn't scout at all. This is because his build would not change regardless of what MC was doing but still, what if MC dt rushed?

1360642758.0,18cwha,A very easy way to win TvPs,MetagameTitan,32,3,30,"Hi everyone

The overall idea is:
- Hit with a stim 2rax at 7:20
- Kill
- Fast tech to two medivacs on 2 barracks and hit the 10 minute timing as strong as you would with a normal 1rax FE. (Your upgrades might be stunted.)

The detailed build:
http://www.sc2planner.com/#TaaaaoEaaoFaoDaacoCjoFoQafoEaaiZoPaoEiZakiKafiZoEkaiZakoEaiZakoEiZafaiZkaoAaoIoDaoEiRcafoEkiZaoKoSaiZjaoCiZjaiBaafoEiZkfaaiZkaaaa

Be sure that you are constantly producing from your 2rax. If you sent an scv scout you might have a short break in production but otherwise your CC and 2rax must all be constantly producing. 

Try to fake a conc 2rax by applying a little pressure

I've tried this build a lot on NA with great success. It is not common in the TvP metagame, there is hardly any way for an expanding protoss to defend. Those who try to forcefield you away will find that they only have energy for a couple of forcefields (Although I would recommend this on maps like antiga, cloud kingdom or daybreak where there are wide entrances to the natural). After the stim push, your relatively early medivacs should come as a surprise to them.

The beauty of this build is it's VERY EASY. You don't have to worry about 2 base macro or defending all-ins (if they all-in you they die)

Comments+Criticism welcome!

What this has resulted in? It has greatly

Now

- try to box accurately.
The way i do is is that i say okay, then the whole. You get my point

- I remember watching a video on you tube to further enhance my selection to increase the effectiveness of my splitting. It's some sort of line splitting. What you basically do is you form a vertical or horizontal line. If you do this often enough you can select a whole row of marines and just move them in rows in any direction you like. I began by just trying to split in rows in the marine split challenge and over time i managed to incorporate it into my overall splits. Thus the results were even better.

IMO this is the most important of all:
 
- box in different directions
When i started boxing, i was really impressed with the results.

http://drop.sc/350526

Here's my replay. It's a bit off

1. Open up standard - 12rax/12gas reaper into expansion

2. Add quick 2nd gas (right after reactor on rax) and transition into 2 Medivac

3. If he goes Colossus tech

4. Don't go for quick 3rd, add 2 gas on natural, and 2 additional Factories

5. Push out with 1/1 Upgrades

6. Add a third

7. Add 2 additonal Factories and go for a kill with 2/2 if you feel like you've done enough damage

8. Otherwise add 2 Starports and go Banshee/Raven/Viking/Hellion composition

9. Terran Air &gt; Protoss Air as you can see if the final battle. PDDs buttrape mass Tempest and against Void Rays


A bit off topic: I know my control wasn't perfect, normally you should:

a) Do this Hellion harras I mentioned earlier

b) Send 3-4 Banshees to get rid of those Immortals before they rape your economy

c) In the final fight split Banshees, kill the Templars with banshees and then go in with the rest of your army

It's not as though I think it is weak; it certainly does a lot of damage. However it is simply not an *efficient* spell.

Here's how Seeker Missile compares to the AoE spells of the other races:

**Cost:** This is my biggest issue with this spell. **It costs 125 energy!** Compare that to the energy cost of Storm or Fungal

**Range:** Seeker Missile has a range of **6**. What is the range of Fungal and Storm? **9.** This does not bug me as much as the cost issue

How can this be improved? Well, and we need to get them well before they are actually needed. A good fix would be to reduce the energy cost to 100, but give the spell a cool down of something like 20 seconds. This would ensure Terrans are not just sending volley after volley of missiles, but the spell would actually become useful. 

I'm not looking for a spell caster to win the game for Terrans, but I felt I needed to say something.

**TL;DR** Reduce the energy cost of Seeker Missile and give it a cool down. Maybe even increase its' range.",self,t5_2tfht,False,,icon-rank-platinum,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/v8jt0/probably_preaching_to_the_choir_but_i_feel_seeker/

Some pointers about this build and when should you do it:

- You WILL need to scout if he's going for earl roach push

- You need to be able to know when to pull out on fights and not commit

- The follow up for this is exclusively mech and you should be getting double gas on your natural in the process of making hellions

- This build originally was blue flame hellions and the starport built a medivac(to drop) which made is susceptible to spire play

- You will float minerals and you need to know when to add more factories and armory and another CC.

- This is a pretty multi-tasking intensive build but as you can see

- Counter-attacks are painful and if you see a lot of roaches

Ive been playing SC2 for about 1-2 months and have gotten to the top of silver league doing a rough 1rax FE and occasional 2-4rax if I see the opponent use an irresponsible FE. Then I learned about timing(medvacs+upgrades at 10) and I havnt lost since. 

My worry is that I am aweful mid-late game and soon will play players that can stop this. I dont know what my problem is

But I can win games without trying doing this timing attack. 

Should I get to a higher league and worry about it then? Should I practice on these lower leagues? I am doing extremely low league things like taking expos extremely far away from my base because I dont get scouted. So what is suggested?

This is not going to be a specific step by step guide because I won't claim to have optimized this build at all but I've been able to hurt Diamond Zergs quite hard with it because of how rapidly and powerfully it changes its intentions.

Now I am sure you've all considered Marine/Marauder/Hellion harassment as a good move against the new Zerg. Well it's nice

So, followed by 2 gas, your walloff of choice, and once you feel you can at least survive some light harassment and are confident you are not about to get baneling busted (a few marines and a bunker) throw down 2 reactors, and as soon as you can, 2 factories. Once your factories finish, put them on the 2 reactors, and use the 2 tech labs to get stim and combat shields.

Attack his third as soon as it finishes. You can either kill it, I prevented him from even dropping his third, and then in the very next game I destroyed his third and 2 queens. While doing so, you'll find that stim and combat shield finishes, AND you can afford a third command center once you lay off the quad-hellion production. Immediatly switch the factories and barracks positions and drop a starport and 2 engi bays as soon as you can. You are now producing 4 marines with stim and combat shields, and 2 seige tanks at a time. Add gas as is your preference and 1-2 more barracks.

So now, perhaps having denied the Zergs third, a lot of creep, some queens, and maybe even having your group of marauder hellion survive and sitting at home.

There are a lot of edges to be rounded in this build (which is why I share theory and not hard numbers). I find I have a surplus of money and yet am still beating Diamond players. Starport can go down sooner, and Marines with Stim/Combat Shields before Mutas become a problem for you.

Good luck slaying bugs folks!

EDIT: As requested

**Few observations about this game:**

* Notice at the end that my macro sucks? If yours is better
* He had the larva, he saw 1 marine with a bunch of mauraders and hellions and thought that if he waited on muta he could crush me, but he had no idea I was producing marines, with combat shields, and stim with double engi as if I was going marine tank from the start, plus lings don't do so well against hellions
* It looks really strong against mutas, but I DID have an engi bay and could have dropped turrets to defend that easily.
* He uses crawlers, but they take reduced damage from them as well. (As they are not light nor armoured)

EDIT3: Here is another [replay](http://drop.sc/213847) of the same build but I think handled a little better.

Redditors who repeatedly break this rule will be banned (everyone has been warned every time this rule has been broken so far, so don't worry about accidental bans or anything of that nature).  Feel free to advertise your stream (we WANT you, streamers), but just keep it to the weekly posts so that everything is more organized and people know where to look to find their favorite streamers.  Thanks for your cooperation on this rule!

Also, so be sure to idle in the chat channel with your fellow Terran brethren to shoot the shit or set up some custom games when you're not pwning up the ladder!  This applies to both Wings of Liberty AND Heart of the Swarm.  We have a chat channel in both of these--but the fun you have is directly proportional to the amount of you guys that chill there,--so let's get everyone in on this party!

**GosuBuilds Stuff**

Lastly, because it's still in beta and balance changes are no doubt going to occur between now and March 12th, the official switch over to Heart of the Swarm will only happen ON March 12th and not before.  If you're looking for a build between now and then, a couple little birdies told me that opening hellbat drop was a pretty good idea ;D

Recently while I have been looking for solid macro terran strategies versus zerg I have noticed a trend of circular logic.

So from a general overview of tvz strategy the game plan for most terrans is to fast expand and proceed to do damage to the zerg economy (either by killing workers or forcing them to produce combat units) so that their drone count stays low. From what I have seen
From a lower level point of view where apm and consequently multitasking ability are lacking

So when me and other lower league players (ie. bronze-gold) ask for macro builds to use vs zerg (and other matchups as well) we seem to recieve a lot of answers that give two or three paragraphs of ""this build is good because..."" and end with ""...but it requires good multitasking.""

The logic problem I notice is that there is a fundamental diffrence between the advice given to lower league players for improvement and ""how to play.""
So when an unskilled player goes searching for a standard build (in tvz for example)
Then later
And even further on after that, because that style can be beaten simply from the diffrence in the fundamental ways the three races work.
The player might then go back to the internet searching for an answer to why they keep losing. And the answer might very well be: ""a macro style like that doesn't work for terran because zerg can just get 70-80 drones and get lair tech freely, you can even play greedy and get a third OC. Its awesome...but requires good multitasking.""

And that is where I have come full circle. I have also searched for answers to this paradox, and it just seems like they are too specialized for beginers to realy start improving with (Especialy the aggresive variants).

This is a train of logic I have been frustrated by personaly

So, each player couldn't afford 400 min investment because they'll simply get run over). What Illusion does instead of losing all of his SCVs or sending back his army, he instead pulls his SCVs and finds the SCV that the Zealot was target to (the Toss probably did shift-A-click to harass), and had that one run to Illu's army and sent the rest of the SCVs back to mine. Thusly, the Zealot follows that one SCV (the P's multitasking is being spent trying to hold off Illusion's force at the front) and he doesn't end up winning now, but he kills some probes and after a few more battles he pushes threw to get victory. If he had not done that move and allowed the Zealot to kill the workers he would have no eco to fall back on, and if he pulled his workers then he would've lost so much mining time he would've probably lost to the P's counter attack due to his stunted production. Pretty cool.

* 25 orbital at nat

* 36 2 more rax (eventually you want 3 rax
* 36 make reactor on 1st barracks (will be used for reactor hellions)
* 37 bunker
* 44 start making reactor hellions until you have 6
* 46 double ebay
* 60 stim
* 60 starport
* 60 double gas at nat
* 73 1/1 upgrades
* 85 armory  

This is nothing new

Once your first 2 medivacs are out, load them with marines and drop again. Aim to have at least 2 battles (3 is beter) going on at once so the zerg has to split his army and run around with his slow infestors.

 If he is going muta then you should stop dropping. The great thing about this build is you always have an amazing 3 base economy and double upgrades going back home. You can just keep trading with the zerg and never let him get a 4th.

Open up with the normal reactor expand

while getting the hellions

After the 6th hellion is out

While getting the 2 barracks

Once the 2 rax and the factory is done with the reactor

When the engi finishes

When the starport finishes, and +1 attack. 

this move-out should be around 10minutes-10:30, it should catch him as his third base is finishing up and he's going to want to have been droning up as he'll have probably recently cleared out your hellions to have taken that third base.

While pushing out

When you get your third base, and if they go infestors, add a starport with a tech lab(otherwise, stay without that 2nd starport)

Basically, and a good number of tanks. I have found that with this style I can attack over and over again with mass amounts of marines and resupply quickly. the early attack almost always does damage, and if it doesn't, I can simply pick up all but a very few of my marines, and go back to base. 

The style I'm employing in the mid game, and a ton of medivacs. if you can split well, and keep your upgrades constant(double upgrading all the time.. you have the one engi up until you're 65-75% done your +1 armor, then add another engi and an armory to double upgrade as soon as you can +2)

The style I employ in the late game, and constant pushes towards his far bases while dropping his main and taking out tech.

You may or may not like this post, have the time, and before I quit for a while(I'm back now) I was able to consistently beat top masters and low GM zergs without problem, while I think my overall skill was much lower(My TvT and TvP were only mid-masters)

I forgot to add, 1 fact, and when I see them get hive, I add 3 starports(total 4). if they go ultra, I always get a total of 5 starports, 2 having techlabs, and I make banshees, or just sniping infestors) if they don't have mutas.

As you all may or may not know

The wins, not just among the Zerg players (don't go onto ATZ now, it's not pretty), but also spectators who don't even play the game (in r/starcraft and friends who don't even play SC2). The concept that biomine can start a chain reaction parade after a few good connections, and the fact that biomine can trade very well regardless of upgrade disadvantage, meant that Polt's constant aggression and impeccable micro gave him some very close wins.

Because biomine is mostly mineral based and forces gas reactions from Zerg to hold

Honestly
Once you have 5-6 reapers out (especially with the 10HP Buff) all it takes is a little micro to fight Stalkers head on. 

It is VERY EASY to kill a stalker with 3 reapers

I basically open Reapers and start pumping out siege tanks one at a time... then I get 2 more factories ASAP and start pumping out widow mines. I've been able to defend immortal pushes and blink-stalker all-ins with ease because of the threat of reapers delaying these pushes.

The only weakness is a very fast oracle before I get my E.Bay and turrets up

Here is the build

-1Rax FE is a stronger build than CC first in TvP.  This is largely due to the fact that CC first gives you few reactionary options against a greedy Protoss.

-Against a Nexus first build

-A Protoss player normally won't have their first stalker out (much less a sentry) until around 5 minutes into the game if they go Nexus first.  This leaves them extremely vulnerable to a hellion runby in the natural.

-In addition

-Behind this

I am going to try this next time I see a Nexus first.  I find this preferable to going for the greed race.

Because stim used to have such a short research time, and then eventually in low platinum by the end of season 1 with a variety of relatively cheesy plays.

At this point however I needed to actually learn how to play the game

There are always aggressive builds that can get you some wins on ladder but I felt as though I really wanted to improve my overall game. I committed myself to only going for big macro plays and let my opponent do the early attacking.

How do I regain my interest and find fun in Terran again?

I am fairly new to the game with about 250 games played in platinum. I have always been a fan of Terran. When i watched Brood War i always rooted for the Terran, and MKP do so many things at once so damn good. 

Lately i have been having issues though. The constant losing to zergs, so i will. Then i will run into that zerg. And i will get steam rolled.

I recently decided to try Zerg. I went on a pretty nice win streak knowing only the basics (15 hatch ZvT, and i was winning. So i decided to play Terran again thinking because i was doing so well with Zerg that maybe i got better overall and would finally start winning again as Terran.

I didn't. I lost

I know many Terrans have switched to Protoss or Zerg because they were getting into rough patches where the grass seems greener on the other side. But i am trying to stick with Terran.

So my question is

Does it seem like i am more suited for the swarm? Or is it merely something most Terrans go through once you hit high platinum?

1340926586.0,vrnp9,[D] Supply drop gasless FE build,Drabzalver,34,16,71,"Okay, and MULE. A lot of people will tell you that a MULE is always better unless you get supply blocked because a MULE gives you 270 minerals, it means you had 100 minerals more to work with 30 seconds earlier

Point is, the 50 minerals you start with are invaluable, later on, 50 minerals don't mean anything to you. The 100 minerals supply drop gives you in the past may in fact be worth more than the 270 minerals a mule gives you over time in some cases. That is why I sort of started to experiment with this build order:

- 10 depot
- 13 rax (you can go 12 if you want
- 16 OC (whenever rax finishes, your OC will always finish in time for the supply drop to not get blocked and you're not rushing the OC to get an earlier mule).
- 2 marines
- as soon as OC finishes
- at 400 minerals

Essentially the build is a T extractor trick if you will, I get it at 3:25.

The further beauty of this build is how well it fits, I however have 8 less supply available so I have to make another extra depot later but I can get my infrastructure up much earlier.

The downside of this build is that you cannot wall off with it. Walling off early game as T has numerous benefits, an early wall is often indicative of a gasless FE but for all he knows you're making 2 extra rax behind that or you've taken gas and you're trying to trick him, with this build there's no real way to keep the scouting worker outside of your base. Another thing of course is that you have a depot with a big 'kill me' target on it that will cost you 16 supply when killed.

Another thing is that you may get into your opponent's head

Discuss.

Edit: A note is that this build is basically optimized to be benificial for my take on gasless FE

- Like to start the second OC before a second depot (I would not recommend cutting scvs for this as this basically refutes the purpose
- Like to wall off
- Like to scout late rather than early

that the benefits of this little trick really reduce.

My question is: How do you deal with storms?

I had a game recently (no replay, I moved back out of it but it always seemed to do massive amounts of damage, bringing my units to very low health even though I reacted immediately. As soon as I stop to fight again, they would drop another one, and I would have to move again. I basically never got an opportunity to fight their army because I was constantly moving out of storms. I would have stutter stepped it, but I was already nearly dying just from moving out of storms so wanted to minimise the damage. All I could do was gg and think to all the times I have watched pro streams (like demuslim, which I watch very often) and all the times I have seem him just stand in storms and still kill the enemy

Also, or sniping HTs. Every time I go for EMPs, they seem to do nothing to help me/take energy off HTs. Every time I decide to snipe, I can never see the HTs in the protoss death ball to hit, or they are so far to the back that I can't get ghosts close enough.

I know I should be watching my replays of lost games where I don't know why I lost, but in this case I don't feel I have the game knowledge to instruct others fully so I decided to combined these two or three problems I'm having into one comprehensive solution. 

Basically here's my idea: I make a series (or at least make a pilot to gauge interest) Where I look at a replay of a game where I lost

**So here's the important questions:**

**Q.** How does this help me?

**A.** When reviewing my games vocally and in front of an audience I'll have less of a tendency to speed through the replay or not watch it at all. I'll have to actually review my mistakes and I can learn from them better. 

**Q.** How does this help you?

**A.** Lower league players can learn from the builds

**Q.** What about people better than me who watch it?

**A.** I want players better than me to watch it simply so they can rip me a new asshole for lack of a better term. While lower league players can learn from my mistakes or builds higher league players can comment on what's going on and thusly everyone will learn from the conversation...in theory.

**Q.** Why?

**A.** Because I think StarCraft is fucking fantastic and I love talking about it and getting demoted sucks



**TL;DR Considering making a series where I review my replays and use insight from the community to improve so I can suck less and get back into masters.**


Also on an additional note I haven't made videos in a long time

My [best ever](http://drop.sc/340621) is 2:26. 

The key points: 

1) Only the refinery needs to be rushed as soon as possible. The depot and the barracks don't need to be started for a while - if they are built as soon as possible the rax will wait ~10-15 seconds until there is enough gas

2) Consequently

3) Don't send the first scv we build to proxy. Send an scv a little before the second one completes, the more minerals are mined and the sooner there's enough for the refinery to be started. 

4) Preemptively send a worker to the geiser so as to begin construction as soon as possible. If 50 minerals are banked

5) Preemptively send workers into gas a little before the gas completes. Demuslim does this and the previous very important two points perfectly

6) Stacking workers on the near mineral fields helps, losing mining time).

Also a complete misunderstanding of what mech play is by some, it just so happens terran uses this style and happens to use it with mechanical units. This is an easy mistake to make,however, and is understandable. What it does mean, however, is slow methodical and mechanical play with a lot of psychological exchanges between players going on (see Yomi). Also something I thought people knew about mech play (from broodwar) was the fact that you should only seige about 30% of your tanks in positions that if say a zerg chose to attack and then the majority are unseiged at a midway point so that if he attacks a positon you move the bulk of your army there while the ones there are used to delay so you can get a good POSITION against the attack since terran units power comes from POSITION. This is part of why mech play is so interesting and should be made viable in all matchups. 


For more information, I'm tired of having arguments with people about this kind of stuff when they clearly do not know what they are talking about.

I understand my advantage -- I have 1 or 2 extra workers and if I can hold him off with even a single worker left I should have an economic advantage.  But it seems like Drones beat SCVs

With Protoss I pull all probes to deal with it, which requires not lifting off the CC, which gives the drones a handy way to force me to attack into them by attacking my CC.  Eventually I just run out of minerals this way.  If I try to keep a couple of SCVs mining I'm at a numerical disadvantage and lose that way.

The fact that it comes before my 9-scout makes it even worse, but that's contingent on knowing it's coming.  Pulling all SCVs, lining them up and hold-positioning them at the top of the ramp seems like giving the zerg exactly what he needs to kill me.  Do I save 50 minerals, block the ramp and just land the CC somewhere else?

1360824170.0,18i2dg,TvZ 7:30 Minute Marine/Marauder/Widow Mine pressure build [HotS],tjloff,17,1,8,"Hello, but I've had much more practice with it now and believe I have a semi-optimal build order for it and many more replays. The idea of this build is to open up with a fast reaper  (**DO NOT LET THIS REAPER DIE**) in order to get scouting information while you take a second command center
(All these games were played around a low masters/high diamond level)



Replay 1: TheMetal vs [NASL]MrBitter (He said it was real

http://drop.sc/304578  
I start this game with my standard reaper fe opening. I use the reaper to cause some minor economic damage, and I place a widow mine under it for annoyance and so I know when he decides to retake the third. After denying the third I sit at the watchtower to keep an eye out for any pressure - the zerg sends out a reasonably large ling force, but my mines, marines and marauder easily clean it up. The game then transitions to a 3 base marine tank push which ends the game thanks to tanks and marine splits vs ling/baneling(I fucked up on the ling run-bys and responded very poorly, which put me father behind than I should have been. On a more positive note, because of how Antiga is designed, it's very easy to take the gold base early using marine/tank which helps increase any economic lead exponentially)



Replay 2: TheMetal vs Lampan

http://drop.sc/304579  
Again I use the reaper fe opening into the marine/marauder/mine push. I made a very very bad mistake in letting my reaper die at the start, but the zreg was making mutalisks at this time and I forgot to scan his bases and it caught me completely off gaurd. The mass mutalisks did an insane amount of damage due to my lack of scouting, and set me too far behind economically to come back. However had I scouted the mutas, I could have easily dropped multiple missile turrets to defend each base and macro up enough to simply overpower the zerg.



Replay 3: TheMetal vs Faust

http://drop.sc/304580  
Standard reaper fe into the 7:30 push. The zerg took a greedy early third and I was able to kill it



Replay 4: TheMetal vs Fatyeti

http://drop.sc/304581  
Reaper fe into 7:30 push. Because I lost my reaper, I pushed up to the watchtower in order to gain map control. Around this time I took a few small engagements that ended pretty favorable for me thanks to stim and combat shields. Once I started getting some tanks out, I took a third base and dropped a fourth cc. I actually scouted the mutas this game and was able to drop missile turrets at each base greatly limiting the amount of damage they did. I also made a few thors because fuck mutas ^_^. Then I took the gold base and again took the xel'naga and gained map control. The zerg ninjad the 8 o'clock base, which took me longer to notice than It should have. The zerg than engaged onto my army with muta/ling/bling, but my marine/tank/thor destroyed the zerg army. After a few small engagements, I noticed the ninja base and went to kill it. The zerg tried to catch my unites at his hidden expo, but my thor tanked almost all the banelings allowing the marines and marauders to kill the lings and mutas. At this point I just doom-pushed and won the game.



Replay 5: TheMetal vs [904]iPTunK

http://drop.sc/304582  
Reaper fe opening. However this zerg has some sort of mental disorder and was trying to do some sort of 1 base roach-ling play. I scout this and drop a bunker on the highground, the zerg had no third so I burrowed a widow and pushed into the natural to get some scouting information. I saw a shitton of lings and roaches and decided to backoff and quickly finish my depot wall at my nat to fend off any incoming pressure. At around 11 minutes I begin to get scared and scan his base, I see a finishing bling nest and roach warred, so I was assured there would be no mutas and simply pushed out and took my third with the use of siege tanks. I tried to push out but got caught in a terrible position by the zerg army. The one tank, however, sieged up in the little crevice next to the destructible rocks prevented the zerg from walking into my nat and killing me off completely. The zerg then pushed out witha  sizable roach/ling/bling force and killed my third command center because I accidentally started a scv instead of lifting it off. This was a major mistake and turned what was an easy win into an extremely close game. I was able to kcik the zerg out and retake my third base. I pushed out with a small army to check for a zerg fourth, which was non-existant. My army got caught here but I was able to make my unites pretty cost effective thanks to splits and siege tanks. Once I had 8 tanks, so i dropped 5 more tech labs to increase marauder production. I ended up doing a doompush with mostly marauders and tanks and winning the game.


The basic build order is:

10 depot

12 rax

13 gas

15 oc

15 reaper (skip marine) 

~18 cc(2)

~20 fact

~23 barracks(2) &amp; tech lab on barracks(1) (Start stim once finished)

~24 bunker at nat

~7:30 push out with 2 mines

1357018660.0,15reml,Some general TvP advice,peachy126,21,5,9,"So there's been a couple of threads about how to deal with various all-ins

First

Standard play for Protoss against Terran right now is a 1-gate expand. What can change a little bit is the combination of early gateway units produced and where the gas, maybe start using DT's for harass and begin to get the more expensive upgrades (2/2, charge, blink). By the lategame, you'll be facing a mixture of all the high tech units and a backbone of high-health zealots. 

As Terran, add more infrastructure and try to deny the protoss third. This can vary  You win by killing his splash damage -- sniping HTs with ghosts or colossi with vikings, or both -- then dancing your marines over the super-weak gateway ball beneath all the shiny stuff. The ultimate army you want to get to is about 15 ghosts, 12 vikings, and the remainder about 1:1 marines marauders and a decent number of medivacs.

So the actual game:

You want to scout to find any deviation from standard play and determine a response. For example, you can rule out early pressure and transition into a 3 OC build or an all in if you want.

If you scout 2 gasses, blink stalkers, DT's or immortals. You'll want to adjust your build to be more defensive. Do this by adding more techlabs to your initial rax and building bunkers. Marauders do well against the majority of all ins (obviously, if it's a VR all in build enough marines to shoot up)  If your opponent hasn't expanded, you can cut some SCV's to build more unit within reason and still be ahead).

If there's no all-in, if you don't see a zealot come out, you can delay your bunker and get your rax up faster.

If you don't think an all-ins coming, build either infrasturcture, upgrades and a faster 3rd CC. 

You should factor the map into this some as well. On maps with more width to approach the third or drop area you can be more aggressive in the midgame

Either way

You want to pick a spot to fight where you can concave so more units are firing and your units wont clump up for easy splash damage. You also want to run back with your bio to keep them out of FF and storm range, try to use your troops to stall until you do. 

For god's sake

Practically, you can get away with a hotkey for bio, medivacs and vikings and another for ghosts. if you stim, then a move in a concave, then emp shower and cloak, you should trade evenly if you don't get stormed to death. 

You want to adjust the amount of vikings to the number of Colossi you see. Around 12 lets you 1 shot them

The engagement is still tough, and be prepared to kill off lots of warp-ins after the fight. If you can make the toss burn his bank with a huge round of zealots, then you can win after the next engagement.

Hope this helps someone at least. I also hope someone elaborates on some of the things I was saying and makes them more specific. If I'm wrong about something please correct me too. 

**TLDR: Adjust your 1 Rax FE into 1+ 10:00 push with how aggressive or greedy the Protoss' build looks. Then don't get stormed and EMP your way to victory.**

1348190098.0,1083yd,Idea to make Mech Style viable in TvP and not effect the balance in TvT and TvZ. ,Womec,16,1,26,"A pretty simple idea actually
Perhaps an EMP shell upgrade that you can get from say the Fusion Core for example so you couldn't get it immediately. This way it would only affect TvP and make tanks more effective vs Toss units and making the immobile but interesting mech style viable again in TvP and not have to add an op unit like the warhound.

If a little more balance is needed the tanks could charge up and glow blue for a fraction of a second and maybe make a sound if it is too imba so the toss could pull back really fast much like the widow mines which you can react to also. 

Also the tank charging up with a blue green emp glow would be cool. :D

Cherenkov radiation color perhaps.

Another idea thats probably not necessary for TvZ in order to buff the tanks a bit if need vs swarm host etc could be to add a concussive shell upgrade that slows units that get splashed or maybe just hit directly by seige fire. It could come from a higher tier building like the fusion core also or maybe just make the marauder concussive shell upgrade work on tanks

* Calldown: Extra Supplies now heals the building it is called down on by 400 HP instantly in addition to calling down supply. Calldown: Extra Supplies can now be used on any non-Bunker building
* Terran gets a new add-on requiring a Engineering Bay and an Armory that is called a ""Drop Facility"" usable by production facilities. This addon allows units to be produced into a queue (that consumes supply) that can later be called down onto anywhere on the map in range of a Sensor Tower.

1. Zealots run bys will take longer to reach the bunker as they will charge in to attack the CC then the AI will tell them to attack the bunker 

2. You can repair the bunker faster (Arguably)

3. If the protoss is going for Dts a missle turret with bunkers behind the mineral line will never do any real damage.

Should there be ""hard counters"" to units in starcraft? It seems to me that gameplay that is focused around soft counters (but not all out shutting a unit down) is much more exciting. Some examples are:

* Hellbat &gt; Zerglings
* High Templar &gt; Vipers
* Viper

There are more but these are just a few examples. I'm not complaing about one race/unit being OP because I am obviously not playing at the highest level. I am just asking from a viewers standpoint if it would be more exciting if there weren't ""hard"" counters to units. I believe a great example of this is hellions vs speedlings. Life can shut down hellion harass with a handful of speedlings just with his superior control. That's exciting! I think that if there were counters but still skill required it would make for a more exciting game!

Sc2 is the first RTS I've ever tried to get in to and I'm really enjoying it! I saw a lot of people around here suggesting filterSC's tutorials so I started with those and battled my way up from the bottom of bronze to top 8 Gold over the last few months.

My knowledge of individual units and their strengths and weaknesses is extremely lacking especially when it comes to the other races



Are there any good resources or videos that just walk through some of these more basic elements? Or is just a case of having to trawl through the blizzard game guide?

I recently made a blog post about the widow mine in TvP and how I don't think it's the panacea of Terran. But I am not one that doesn't least give things a try before writing them off as bad.

Over the past few days I have worked on this build and I haven't lost a single TvP as of yet.

Basic idea:

You open up 13 gas

You get 3 marines just so you have no problem defending a chrono-boosted zealot poke (happens quite often in HotS). Then you start making 2 widow mines at a time once your factory is complete. You get up to 6 or 8 widow mines and are pretty much safe vs. any kind of all-in

Take your natural if you feel safe or once you have your first tank

You can make lots of command centers even before you are maxed (and remember you don't attack until you are maxed). Make lots of tanks and hellbats, they aren't very useful in direct engagements, but you can use them to defend expos, ramps or your main base (vs drops or air). Widow mines are excellent units in that regard, they really help you defensively, but I don't think they are very good in direct high supply-engagements (maybe I'm wrong though, I'm not quite sure yet).

At some point you want to add starports if you feel like your economy is good enough

There are different pushes you can do

It is important to constantly scan your opponent


Pros:

- safe vs. most all-ins (from what I can tell)

- very strong economy in the midgame

- good flexibility (lots of factories and starports to hard-counter transitions)

- double upgrades

Cons:

- No aggressive potential (pure defense)

- need to scan alot or you might get killed by hidden tech switches

- ???

Anyway

1357124192.0,15tkb0,A discourse on lategame TvP engagements and strategy,PassionOfTHeMoletrap,17,5,16,"It's important to realize there are different flavours of TvP

__General style of engagement__

- Stop kiting beyond a certain point in the game. You often see Terrans kiting and kiting and kiting to the point that it hurts them, the range of a marine is the diametre of a command centre. If you have this huge bio ball and you kite that means that you reduce your own dps just as much if not more because the marines at the end of your ball just aren't firing any more. You don't notice it when you press hold position with your kiting but like half of your ball isn't firing because there's nothing in range to fire at. You can see this by kiting like I kite which is move command backwards, attack command forward. I've just always kited with this method and you can see if you do it like this that the marines in the back start to crabwalk because they have no target in range.

- Arc out your army instead of keeping it into a ball, in a circle around your opponent's army. The theoretically ideal formation would be a complete circle around the protoss army at the right distance where every single one of your units is firing. This ensures that forcefields are less useful, your entire army is firing and when zealots kill one target they take time switching to the next, it also gives you far more freedom to box whatever part of your army is being stormed and move that, and only that away, and because it's so thin, he has to storm his own zealots as well if he wants to storm your army.

- After getting the arc, viking control, medivac moving is all second to landing the emps you need. Do not get caught up in the idea that you have to per se save emps for templar or suicide like 10 ghosts just to get the templar, emp actually does damage, carpet the entire army. If emps are at a premium because you don't have many ghosts. Do not focus them on archons. Archons are actually the counter to emp if you don't have _a lot_. Yes, they are almost fully shield but they are also fat and emp is still an AoE. It's like storming thors. Focus emp on zealots in that case. You can easily hit 8 zealots in a giid emp for 400 damage total. You will often hit 1 or 2 archons for 100-200 damage total. a 10 hp archon also deals just as much damage as a 10hp/350sp archon so unless you can actually focus down that last bit of emp, better just make the zealots die quicker which  your army auto targets.

- Do not if at all possible keep your vikings over your army but let them engage from the side

- Storm is in general scarier than colossi especially in small engagements. Storm is also more fickle. If P is behind, do not reward micro as much, and aren't as capable of being outmicroed but in general pretty bad in small armies, they need a huge gateway army to support them. If you can step forward and reach colossi they become worthless and fragile. In general do not attempt to do this unless you know you're going to get it as you often see people losing their entire army over that one prized colossus which survices with 30 hp. In general it's worth it if you think you can finish the colossus in two stutters.

__Before the engagement__

- put marauders in front, stim them and move them towards the opponent before the engagement, this will hopefully bait zealots wasting there charge to which you can pull the marauders back, it puts marauders in front tanking for the more fragile marines and it creates a 'buffer layer' of vacuum, this is important because it makes storming the marines exceedingly diffcult for protoss, approaching templar can easily be focussed down with the marauders

- If at all possible

- Take any fight where he's misformed. Formation is a lot more important for protoss than it is for Terran. The importance of Zealots in front eclipses the importance of marauders in front. Often if you pulled his army away with some drop and he comes scrambling back to defend a base he is completely out of the proper formation

- Don't lead with this clump of ghosts you sometimes see

__Unit compositions__

- __Vikings__: Be considerate of the amount of vikings you're making, it doesn't work like that. There are _three_ important variables to consider: Colossus count, stalker/zealot ratio, amount of forcefields. Pure marauder/medivac in a good arc against pure stalker/colossus is better than making any vikings. Protoss likes to have zealots, not stalkers in their army against you. In this sense, vikings serve to force stalkers. If he's already overmaking stalkers against your very few vikings then drop viking production. His ground army with all those stalkers instead of zealots is significantly weaker. Though be wary of forcefields as they can completely obliterate this idea if they forcefield you in and laser over you with you having no way to kill the colossi. Punish him by not making enough stalkers and too many zealots by making plenty vikings and flying them in _before_ the engagement and just killing all his colossi and only after that stimming in with your bio and dropping mules over his army. The primay reason he gets stalkers is to avoid this scenario. Zealot/colossus actually rapes you during the engagement even if you have vikings if you are only killing the colossi during the engagement rather than before it.

- __Ghosts__: The single most important lategame unit at your disposal. Colossi are not a counter to ghost, they cost the same supply as a marauder, do more dps to zealots than stimmed marauders, cloak, emp, snipe, even nuke. They are simply very good against Protoss. Just get as many ghosts as possible in the lategame when supply becomes the limiting factor and not reapers.

- __Marines or marauders__: There are many schoots of thought on this issue

- __Vikings or medivacs__: Same story

__Metagame__:

- I tend to classify the start of the lategame when P obtains storm + colossi and 3-3 upgrades for P finish. This is the scariest part for Terran who should be on 2-2 upgrades with 3-3 around 30-50% done.^When you are in this window before you have 3-3. Defend by god defend, remax with warpgates or no remax.

- You will never be able to be cost efficient against Protoss with bio, there is no 200/200 costing range upgrade for vikingsm, emp does not cost 200/200 to research) as well as that Terran has more potential to do damage to Protoss in the midgame than in reverse. If the game is even at any point, in general Terran simply will have a more expensive army.

- Don't drop if you can walk. I'm seeing a lot of people load up in medivacs just because they can

- There are certain styles where they forgo AoE and tech and stay on pure gateway for a long time even without storm. Pure gateway with adept forcefielding is cost efficient against even stim and medivacs provided that they are constantly aggressive (or you are) and constantly trade to keep army sizes low

- Don't timing push a protoss who has a lot of sentires to defend that, scare him a lot, expand and go home.

__Experimental strats__

- Lategame reapers, they just build slowly.

- Lategame banshees, also, they cloak.

- Lategame ravens, it seriously fucks up zealot AI.

I know most of you are probably tired of the various links where us low leagues ask for help

I haven't played Starcraft 2 much maybe a total of 100 Multiplayer games but have played WC3 competitively and managed to get Diamond with Zerg. However I disliked the Zerg lategame comps with Ultra or BL. Ultras felt to clumsy and BL have no mobility. 

So I switched to T and I am loving it. However I am having a hard time macroing due to bad habits from WC3. I tend to micro heavily in battles and get tunnel vision and my macro/multitasking suffers.

I don't care about strategies at the moment I am just playing Marine/Tank in every matchup and trying to crush everyone with my macro.

Does anyone have any tips to avoid getting tunnelvision and macroing during battles. Whole game I mumble ""macro up

Considering how much this subreddit has grown recently

1) My first question is in regards to rally points, tanks, thors,
battle cruisers, unless said unit dies. If that is the case they will than revert back to the original rally point just outside my main, instead or remaining next to their structures or rallied to their death somewhere on the map where I have potentially just lost an engagement.     

That being said, rather than trying to use a universal rally system that tends to work in most situations, without the need to alter it often (except in the case of new structures being added to your control group.

So reddit, and how would you recommend I change my rally style?




2) Viking production most commonly starts for terran players when colossus, TvZ, and TvT respectively. When watching pro matches, I've often seen terran players start, and continue to invest in air weapons upgrades despite their air force not necessarily being more than a small minority within their force. 

My question is




3) Ravens. Pros rarely invest in them from what I can tell (with exceptions) despite their having what I see to be a plethora of excellent uses in many matchups. Examples include:

--Early-ish raven in TvZ to more efficiently slow creep spread

--Pdd against Protoss. From what I hear 2-3 ravens with a Pdd each can make a major difference against just about any army composition

-- Raven/s + Vikings in TvT between siege lines lets you counter enemy vikings with Pdd even if you have inferior viking count, underutilized) method of throwing down autoturrets next to front-running enemy sieged tanks to either absorb the initial tank shots as the rest of your army charges, or cause enemy tanks to inflict splash damage on each other

--Mobile Detection (DUH, Surely a raven with your army is more efficient than scanning whenever you need to see burrowed/cloaked units around your force

--Seeker missile. I'll include this here despite recognizing that Pdd is typically the more efficient use of 125 energy. Clumped marines get smashed by it. Using TvT as an example, there is no warning (given in the form of an alert by the game) until the sucker lands, so wouldn't it be efficient to use one in that manner against clumped marines behind/around siege lines, assuming you have air control?

So, in almost every game. Is this something that actually IS used more often than I am led to believe, and I am merely naive? And are there other use for them I have missed? (excluding the outrageously fun but volatile mass raven strategy many a monobattle comes down to)



#4 MMM v Protoss. This may seem obvious, this changes depending on your build/ the opponents build, and how long the game was been going on for, but I feel like there is such a thing as too many marauders when compared to your marine count. 

Simple question: What is a good marauder:Marine Ratio in the highest efficiency MMM composition army I could get in TvP



Anyway, perhaps some good discussion will come of this, as respectable debate and organized information exchange is something I don't think we see enough of on starcraft subreddits :)

Thanks ahead of time for the help

TLDR #1: What rally style do you use

TLDR #2: When should I get Terran Air weapon upgrades for vikings specifically

1370926737.0,1g3nya,On the merits of 11 gas Reactor Hellion TvT,NoseKnowsAll,18,4,45,"**Introduction**

So like many of you guys here

Let me first state that I have NOT seen any pro do this at all (and there are a variety of reasons why)

-----------------

**Build Order**

* 10 Depot
* 11 Refinery
* 13 Barracks
* @100% Barracks
* @100% Reactor
* WIN.

-----------------

**Execution**

I'm not even kidding - it's that simple.  I attack with 2 Hellions, and by that point in time I've won the game.  Unless they have a full walloff and position their marines defending the top of their ramp behind depots (which admittedly is not THAT rare), you can literally just win against anything they are doing.

Vs Reapers

Vs Marines, I have done it anyway, and it still somewhat works.  Marine positioning AND depots are needed to hold.

Vs anything else

I'll illustrate with some drop paths: http://i.imgur.com/6pMpHJg.jpg

It seems possible to spot drops by putting a depot/marine/turret/whatever in the 3 o'clock expansion

So we're safe I guess? But then how do we apply counter-pressure? Our drop path is like 3 times as long and really awkward.

Also in TvT, the guy on the top right is pretty safe no matter which expansion he chooses.

I'll post replays but I'll explain for you guys and what i think when I do things. 
1. First of all you go 1 rax expo

2. You get 1 marine than supplydepot and after that double gas. 

3. The SCV that was building the depo builds the first bunker 

4. With the first 100 gas get a factory. 

5. After that get cloacked banchees. 

(6. You need to scout after the bunker or before that when they go for an all in you have to built at least 3 bunkers and have SCV's prepaired to repair)  

7. After the first banchee and when you can afford it built another factory and an amory. 

8. Start Thor production and harras. (Make sure NOT to lose a banchee

9. Add 2 more rax

10. With about 4 thors you move out. Make sure to take at least 10 SCV's

11. Focus important units with your banchee's

- Control groups. This seems like the trickiest to me. As Protoss, and my templars in one, meaning I can efficently blink forward, aswell as backing up my templars, but still move my whole army with a single click. As Terran, vikings have to be in a seperate group alltogether. Would you suggest I do the same with ghosts, or could I have them in my bio army aswell? Also, since they don't heal if I stutter step. 
- How do I know when to take additional bases? When do I go planetary and when can I go for the orbital?
- Streamers. Which ones give good commentary about what they're doing? I'm looking for Terran who stream similarly to how Axslav does it. Lot's of commentary.
- Other things I should focus on?

I would like to add also that I'm pretty decent mechanically

1. It's obvious that the Warhound needs to be nerfed from 2 to 3 supply. Right now it absolutely destroys everything except spell casters on a per-supply basis (if not per-cost basis).

2. Reapers are not going to make a comeback except for TvT cheese. The +10 HP, but that's pretty much it.

3. Tanks are no longer going to be a massable unit. Something like 80% of the new HOTS units are going to hard-counter them. Hellions and Warhounds will be able to waltz into siege lines and trade cost-efficiently. Vipers and Swarm Hosts will pluck siege lines apart

4. Mech is going to be viable in TvP again. Hellion/Mine/Warhound/Ghost/Viking will be able to take on any Protoss unit combination just like MMMGV does now. The sad thing is that mech TvP is not going to feel much different from playing bio TvP because its going to be Tankless. 

5. Lategame TvZ is going to be impossible. The Ultra buff is huge, are far more mobile, and are just as good at breaking positions. Hydras becoming much more viable will make drops much more difficult to pull off. All four of those units will hard-counter Tanks, so goodbye tanks in TvZ. I see TvZ devolving into a very cheesy matchup where either the Terran all-ins before Hive or simply loses.

6. I was not impressed with battle hellions. The only thing they are better than normal hellions against are Tanks and Roaches (and they're still pretty bad against Roaches). They are not much better versus Zealots than normal hellions (assuming that the normal hellions are microed).

What do I mean? Protoss, this progression, back-door if u will. Both races, at early-mid stage play as terran do and simply producing units and teching. Some faster then others but the principle stays the same. However, past tier 2, somewhat after 15 minutes, terran pretty much looses ability of improving and becomes ""reactionary"" race. All would be good, same as marauders do nothing if ultras are dead. Probably the most ""disgusting"" thing is when protoss mixes HT with Colossis

I strongly believe, give them slow speed-high power, relatively like it was in brood war and add a little bit of speed and get rid of energy (HT's demolish them). Also would be nice to make 250mm cannons on Thors at least somewhat useful.

**My First Attempt

TvZ: So I was experimenting with a fast expand walloff with a bit of deception. I thought I was so clever. The Zerg scouts

In truth, even if it IS scouted I am golden because he will counter Banshees. What I actually do is, build 2 ravens, and within the first 10 seconds of those ravens, get Corvid Reactor, and as soon as those 2 ravens are done I produce 2 more. Ravens take 60 seconds to produce, thus when corvid is done, only 10 energy lower than the first 2 (which are at almost 100 energy). Now at this point I will point out that my engineering bay is not getting +1 armour or weapons, and if at all possible, but that is only because Auto Turrets have a resource value. (Part of the SC2 engine requires anything that can be repaired have a resource value otherwise it is free) but typically I do more damage than I take. If he is well defended against air

After this I preserve the 4 ravens all game. You can go around dropping turrets and killing tumors to prevent creep spread, and as long as I keep those ravens alive, I have it as an option.

Once the harass starts, and sometimes with a few banshees for good measure.

Sounds interesting? It's not. The Ravens arrive at 9 minutes, you will often lose them all. A bane bust has never successfully countered this build, but I am fairly sure it easily could. (Either the turrets or my expansion)

So, I have research that makes them stronger and gives them their third ability, I am meching which is strong against Zerg right now. I even expand confidently. But I still feel I gain no edge in the lategame, and rarely do enough damage to justify putting off regular mech.

Here are a few screen shots to show you my level and abilities.

My ladder: http://i.imgur.com/pvKgHLb.jpg

Pts of the last Protoss I played: http://i.imgur.com/bCsuWjq.jpg

I chose to show these pictures so that you can all have a solid idea of my skill level and ability.  I am not the greatest player in the world nor am I the worst.  I am not extremely active as you can see from my low numbers of games and my high bonus pool.  I also try to enjoy SC2 more by doing fun and unique strategies and trying to learn.  I am not trying very hard to get my points or mmr very high.  With all of this in mind

Or if you so chose opener to be followed by macro.

I was taught this strategy by a German Terran player who's name shall not be disclosed.  It is an economical proxy factory widow mine opener into a two base bio all in.  

The build order is as follows:
10 Depot
12 Rax
13 Gas
@100% Rax send SCV that build Rax to proxy Factory on the other side of the map. 
15 Orbital
16 Supply Depot
after you start the factory build a bunker next to your wall off.
You should now be streaming widow mines into your opponents base.  

Notes on WM:  Your goal is to get a widow mine near the main mineral line of your opponent.  This is optimal but not necessary to win.  A single stalker does not have enough DPS to stop a widow mine from getting into the main and burrowing.  Neither does a zealot if you dodge it a bit.  A mothership core has more than enough dps to stop a widow mine

I usually send three widow mines into at the Protoss base and then make 3 more and send them to my own base.

While making the widow mines and constant marines you will save up enough minerals to get a command center.  Build it on the high ground.  

The follow up I do to this opener is:  I get 2 additional barracks

Some of you may call this gimmicky or whatever but I assure you that is not the case.  This is much less risky than a Protoss proxying a tech for a few reasons.  It is less of an investment to make widow mines than protoss units.  They will always serve at least a small purpose of scouting and containing.  You can lift off your factory and use the tech to get your starport.  On top of all of this you do not have to follow up this build with a two base all in.  You can always do your own variation and macro out of it.  I chose to all in with this build because I don't like playing macro vs toss without very fast upgrades.  

Here are some replays:

http://drop.sc/352366   - this one is fairly sloppy because I was teaching it on my stream.

http://drop.sc/352368   - this one is fairly good!

For most of my Starcraft career I've been in Silver league and have been playing on and off

I got Heart of the Swarm a couple days ago and quickly knocked out my placement matches and was really surprised to see that I placed in Gold after not playing for quite a while and never really getting past 8th ranked Silver. So

I have a lot of trouble with expanding past 2 bases and even then, I don't really know how to tech properly with Terran. I would like to play with marines, tanks, medivacs, and widow mines, but I can never get there quickly and efficiently like I would like to. Thirdly,  one of my big problems is attacking at the right time or moving out to get a foothold that will give me map control. A lot of the time I just find myself trapped at two bases and hoping that my enemy just crashes their army into mine and loses so I win

So far i have made it into diamond and things are going well http://imgur.com/a/eFxqB

I have a few more questions now that I'm am more familiar with what i am doing.

1. When i am going bio vs a Protoss how many reactors should i have vs how many tech labs should i have on my barracks?

2. The same question but against Zerg. When i play vs Zerg i like to make hellbats in my bio ball to help tank and destroy lings but i was wondering how may rax should have reactors and how many should have tech labs if i have say 5 barracks?

3. Also as a general rule what times should i be taking my 3rd 4th and 5th bases in a standard macro style game?

1356384393.0,15e3jb,HOTS Tips - lets look at Swarm facts,Cigarroa14,14,1,1,"&gt; 6.Blinding Cloud does not reduces radius of Widow Mines

&gt; 7.PDD blocks Tempest shots

&gt; 13.Widow Mine splash can damage your and enemy buildings. Probably thats the reason, or it will be able to kill enemy zerg tumors

&gt; 14.Widow Mine attack ignores armor and Hardened Shields (it can 3 shot Immortal), Broodlings and Infested terrans. It also will kill Changeling if not morphed to Marine skin

&gt; 22.Don't forget about new dances for Oracle

&gt; 30.Four banelings can do a lot of damage to group of Hellbats. Just use minimum 4 banelings against hellbats

&gt; 38.Widow Mine will not trigger to Larvas

&gt; 44.Siege Tanks against Swarm Hosts (both in big numbers) always results with zero damage to Siege Tanks. But Blinding Cloud can change that scenario completely

&gt; 45.Mutalisks can quickly reach at 4 speed enemy Medivacs (their speed is 2.5). But for 8 seconds Medivacs can fly at 4.25 speed

&gt; 46.For now units will always auto-leave Blinding Cloud (excluding deployed Siege Tanks). Try to block enemy movement with fungals or mass-zerglings to make Blinding Cloud more effective

&gt; 51.Because of better splash

&gt; 53.PDD does not blocks Thor's High Impact Payload

&gt; 54.Blinding Cloud affects Planetary Fortress, Photons) and Overcharged Nexus. But not affects bunker

&gt; 56.Cloak when the widow mine missle is launched let's unit to take only splash damage (40)

&gt; 60.Only 6 Marines can kill Oracle. 5 Mainres will die to one oracle. But the more marines you have

&gt; 61.Try to drop Widow Mines

&gt; 63.Force Filed does not blocks Widow Mine attack. It can fire missile when it's placed under Force Field

&gt; 64.Try to experiment with Widow Mine and Siege Tank placing.

&gt; 1. If Widow Mine range is not near Siege Tank

&gt; 2. If Widow Mine range is closer to Siege Tank (it placed at 5-6 range from Siege Tank)

&gt; 3. One zergling can't drain Widow Mine charge

&gt; 4. Widow Mine have small delay before attack. As I said

&gt; 67.You can abduct enemy SCV that building something. Of course building process will be stoped

&gt; 71.Abducting Ghost cancels Nuclear Missile spotting

&gt; 72.Splitting or spreading Swarm Hosts and adding creep spread from Overlords or Creep Tumors will significally buff Locusts against Siege Tanks. Locusts can reach enemy tanks quicker and when splitted

About a year ago I lived and breathed for SC2. I'll admit Terran was strong, but the game is so obviously broken. I've just completely lost all faith in Blizzard's ability to make lategame work for Terran.

The game used to be so exciting to watch

What bothers me so much is not only how easy Blizzard has made Zerg and Protoss to play strategically

And let's be realistic. Zergs and Protoss is super easy to play, not to mention it requires a lot less APM to control their armies.

Obviously Zerg is the biggest problem. Not only has Terran lategame been nerfed, because there's no space behind mains on newer maps. It also means the only unit we ever see Zergs use lair for is Infestor, because mutalisks have become a joke compared to their former days of glory with high multitasking from both Zerg and Terran fighting with marines, thors and turrets against giant clouds of 30+ mutalisks.

Most of the action that the game sees now, Z is making infestors!"". We wait till lategame, where Zerg obviously wins. 

Should the Terran get ahead early on, he should've attacked before the Zerg made infestors"".

It is just such a joke. We used to be such a mighty race. I really think Zerg needed some buffs, also Blizzard up until recently. It's great that Blizzard promoted a unit, but they really turned it into Infestorcraft. I'm sick and tired of always tuning into streams, and 95% of the time it's PvZ, because Terrans have been evaporated from the scene. And Terran isn't even entertaining to watch anymore. Sure it's fun watching lategame Metropolis games, where T can turtle back and hope the Zerg is stupid enough to not just take all the bases, and sit back with all the money

It's no fucking wonder LoL is becoming so popular. Blizzard has been so eager to test small fucking nonsense details thoroughly such as goddamn overlord speed. Give them the fucking speed I don't give a shit. Double it, Ravens, Battlecruisers, Carriers, Mutalisks, Vikings whatever more usable. Their way of balancing the game has been unentertaining, and I don't feel like playing it anymore, and see them getting fungaled to death time and time again.

I'm not gonna bother with this game until WoL is out

When you read about TvZ/TvP the common complaints are about MMM being too strong and Terran being able to stay on T1/2 units the whole game, obviously in certain situations you add Ghosts/Vikings/Thors/Tanks to your army but we don't really have anything to tech into like Protoss and Zerg do. When you're the Terran it's completely up to you to be the aggressor and if you fail to do the necessary damage before Collosus/Templar or Infestors/Ultralisks/Brood are out you're left completely behind and fighting the rest of the game from the back foot. 

Nowadays Zerg have extra queens to defend early game pressure

Protoss have also become adept at defending the classic 9-10minute timing push

For Protoss and Zerg while they're fighting and trading armies they are also teching to their late-game units (Archons, often the only time we see Battlecruisers are in late game TvT were it's a Tank vs Tank seige war, and even then it's very rare. A player I can think of that does this is Demuslim. 


So what do you guys think? Should the Battlecruiser been changed? If so what would you do to change it? I know it's getting a small speed increasing ability in HotS but I don't think that fixes any of the issues.

The build is as follows:

10 depot (not at wall)

12 Rax (edge of wall)

13 refinery

depot when needed

@100 gas Factory at other edge of wall

Next refinery

Starport
Push at two hellions and the marines you have with constant production out of the fact and rax

Recently I have been giving hellion/marauder compositions a try in the early game. I have been met with mixed success, and see what other players think. The style feels very fluid and safe, and I haven't lost in such a way where I wished I'd had a different mix. 

I expect one of the first retorts to come up would be: ""why not just use hellbats?"" To which I answer: Mobility

Hellions are great for simply getting out on the map

Build wise, can build something other than medivacs or delay the starport altogether. 

Don't get me wrong

The style functions fairly differently depending on matchup

TvT: 

This is the matchup where I feel the most safe with this style. The reaper scout is always nice, drops). And further on you have enough of them to thwart hellbats, plus marauders to defend against thors. I don't neglect marines though, but if I do, I make sure to have a Viking or two.

I also tend to extend my hellion usage the longest in this matchup

TvZ: 

There's not a whole lot to say here. It plays out like how Polt used to use it. If Zerg is greedy you can punish them

TvP: 

Easily the weirdest matchup. Before making hellions

The first hellions I make immediately scour the map (while that reaper pokes into their base as much as possible) to eliminate the treat of proxies.

I play this matchup extremely aggressive and unsubtle. Usually I just get 2 extra rax (reactored) and +1 bio attack, and honestly, I don't think the nexus cannon is nearly as good as people think (but I'm not arguing that point).

Otherwise I just do some hellion drops

As always

So what do you guys think? I definitely enjoy this style because it feels very meta independent

If there are any blind counters to this style

**TL;DR: 2 port cloaked banshee rush every game.**

Just before we get into the question I'll give some background about myself and my play. 

Currently I'm high diamond on NA and low masters on EU

Something that I've tried is going for hellbats instead of ghosts to tank which works if they go really zealot based without high colossi count but doesn't seem like something that I can rely on.

What I'm looking for are some suggestions on what I could do other than practice late game against protoss but I don't seem to find many when laddering.

The traditional approach with ghosts: got me Ghosts all hot-keyed up... cloak... move forward... scan for Observers... finger on the trigger ready to snipe... bollocks all my Ghosts are dead.

I've tried keeping my Ghosts inside the bio-ball but then I find that by the time I've figured out where his Templars are multiple storms have already hit and I'm never even sure if my EMPs have landed. Is it just me or is the EMP animation/sound effect really subtle? Either way I get stomped.

The HotS beta deserves some space here too.

Right now, and I am sure other people will pitch in with this.

**Let's get on to the juicy bits!**

Here are my current builds and tactics:

* **TvZ** - I go for marine/medivac/widow mine from a pretty early reactor expand. I push out with stim and CS when my first two or four medivacs pop, you can exit your safe zone and attack and then run back. My last game was against a GM and I won using this tactic!

* **TvT** - Reaper expand into Widow mines; safe against just about everything I have encountered. It's TvT so you have to adapt to what he does to win. I still tend toward marine/tank with some widow mines in there

* **TvP** - Good old TvP 2rax from WoL beta. If you push with your first marauder and 5 marines, but more often than not I just win the game outright because Protoss rely too much on MS Core Purify to hold off stuff.

Most of the Terrans I know in the beta tend toward mech strategies. I don't think these are the future because mech will get figured out eventually. But I see the potential of it

EDIT: I just want you to know how much your small little observations and thoughts about the matchups and tactics you've employed matter. There is SO much knowledge to be learned and collected, and would love if you did the same!

Anyway

Also many pro-players were/are complaining about Protoss and how difficult it can be to crush them.

I personally do not hear it too often the other way around.. Just no one complains about Terran being OP.
Only NightEnd said in a recent interview
In fact

I still remember JD, that Zerg, if played perfectly, is the best race. 
Is he right? - Could be: Zergs seem to dominate.. and so does Protoss, we had a Terran in GSL Final, but he is considered to be the best player ever in SCII until now. But what i want to say with that in general: The amount of Terran participants has reduced, as well as the amount of Terran winners (and even 2nd, 3rd, 4th place.)

How about the missing Terran amount in ladder? I do experience that every day. There are a lot less Terrans than a couple of month ago.

To sum it up: Are we as Terran are underpowered? If yes

On that same note, and mutas are a bad time for a lower league player like myself. 

Least enjoyable for myself is the TvT siege tank crawl. 3 bases just loaded in siege tanks and AA. Only way to win is to stop their economy. Winning after 40 min of draining their minerals is a drag.

It's extremely weak against 1-base builds other than cloaked banshee. Due to the early reactors it has fewer marines than a standard 3rax tech build

This was OK when people weren't used to the build and you could just stim up the ramp and win

So essentially you should always be behind in some way when doing the Thorzain build.  Seeing as it was only decent against a 1rax fe
