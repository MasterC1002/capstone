Dear [insert senator's name]
The Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA) has once again been introduced in the House. Like last year's CISPA

CISPA's passage would be a major blow to our online privacy, if we know that Big Brother could get a feed of everything we say and do.

Jacob Limberios died by gunshot wound to the head on March 2, all took a turn test firing a gun in the backyard of the house prior to Jacob’s death.  Alcohol was consumed prior to the test firing.  After test firing the gun, Jacob and the three witnesses went inside the house.  At that time, Jacob completely unloaded the gun onto the floor.  One of the witnesses at the house picked both the casings and the live round up from the floor.  Apparently, Jacob then reloaded the live round into the gun.  Jacob then handed the gun to another witness whom requested to see the gun again.  The gun was supposedly passed around among the three witnesses.  One of the witnesses admitted that Jacob warned the others to be careful because there was a live round was in the chamber.
 
Around that time
 
Within minutes of the shooting, the Sandusky County Sheriff also arrived.  At one point, the Officers were heard laughing over Jacob’s dead body, with one of them questioning who was going to pick up the bill for clean up.  This occurred while Michael Limberios, Jacob’s father, stood outside the house in the freezing cold, grieving the loss of his son.
 
In violation of its own standard procedure, or otherwise determine their blood/alcohol content; did not collect the evidence that would assist in determining the amount of alcohol that had been consumed; allowed one of the witnesses to change her clothes at the death scene without taking them into evidence; allowed another witness to throw away his blood-splattered shoes in the Deputy’s presence; did not retrieve the bullet from the attic of the residence; did not collect DNA or fingerprints from the witnesses; did not submit the gun for testing, or otherwise having appropriate tests conducted; did not take measurements of the room, did not document the location of physical evidence in the room, did not document the location of the bullet hole in the ceiling, and/or did not document the location of where the bullet lodged in the attic; did not collect and preserving Jacob’s clothing; did not require Jacob’s body to be properly examined to gather valuable forensic evidence; and allowed Jacob’s body to be removed, embalmed and buried within a matter of days.
 
Further there were several inconsistencies with the statements given by the three witnesses in the house that night.  In particular, the Sandusky County Coroner specifically stated: “deceased shot self in the head, may not have realized the gun was loaded.”
 
Further, and the bullet would have travelled towards the north or west side of the residence. However, in reality the bullet travelled toward the south side, went into the ceiling, and lodged in a beam in the attic.
 
Also
 
The Sandusky County Coroner’s ruling of “suicide”, did not properly collect evidence, and freely permitted the destruction of valuable evidence.  Further, the Sandusky County Coroner made the determination of essentially accidental suicide, which to this day he sticks by, without examining the death scene, without examining Jacob’s body, and without talking to a single witness.
 
Renowned forensic pathologist Dr. Cyril Wecht has declared that the Sandusky County’s Coroner’s ruling on Jacob’s death certificate was wrong.  Dr. Cyril Wecht determined that, based on a reasonable degree of medical and scientific certainty, there is no way that Limberios could have shot himself, either by accident or with suicidal intent.  The shot had to be fired by someone else, and that Jacob’s death was a result of a homicide.”
 
After the investigation was closed initially the night of Jacob’s death, the Sheriff’s Department refused to conduct any further investigation, declaring the investigation “over” on April 9, 2012.  Jacob’s parents were forced to hire Counsel.  Over the course of the next few months, Counsel repeatedly tried to contact the Sandusky County Coroner, who refused to talk or communicate with Counsel.  In addition, Counsel repeatedly asked the Sandusky County Prosecutor to conduct an autopsy of Jacob.  Those requests were refused. 
 
After several months of requesting Sandusky County officials to conduct a proper investigation into the death of their son, Michael and Shannon Limberios, were forced to file a case on October 19, 2012 (over seven months after Jacob’s death).  Finally, on November 2, 2012, it seemed that Sandusky County was going to reopen the investigation into Jacob’s death.  However, and over a year after Jacob’s death
 
The Sandusky County Prosecutor and his successor have sought delays in Jacob’s family’s search for the truth, have publicly suggested that they have evidence to support their untenable position that Jacob shot himself but have not shared what that evidence is.  Even more so, Sandusky County has refused Michael and Shannon Limberios’ requests to have the as the Ohio Attorney General come in and take over the investigation. 
 
All of the above actions have taken a tremendous emotional and economic toll on Michael and Shannon Limberios. They have repeatedly stated that all they want is to know what happened to their son on the night that he died.  With each passing day Michael and Shannon Limberios suffer more grief, they have not even begun to heal from their horrible loss. 
 
Please help the Limberios family, to find out the truth about what happened to Jacob.  You can do so by going to the petition that is pinned to the top of this post and requesting that the Ohio Attorney General’s Office finally take over the investigation of Jacob’s death.  Also, please ask others to join in on our efforts and sign and share the petition.  We can’t thank you enough for your continued support.",,False,self,t5_2qn7b,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ohio/comments/1bcwvz/rohio_my_best_friend_died_from_a_gunshot_wound_to/

1320508891.0,m1gwg,Basic information about Issues 1-3 without telling you how to vote,yerpamphleteer,50,8,18,"Issue 1: The state constitution currently says that judges cannot run for reelection after their 70th birthdays. This issue is simple: it changes that age to 75. Proponents say that people are living longer and with age comes wisdom. Opponents say that sometimes judges are not as sharp as they used to be

Issue 2: This is clearly an extremely controversial issue. ""No"" repeals SB 5,"" and in the case of firefighters and police, ""safety issues."" They specifically are not allowed to bargain to pay less than 15% of their health care and less than 10% of their salary for their pensions. It also prohibits all public employees from striking (police and fire already cannot strike). It also forbids automatic pay increases every year, but rather requires that all raises be based on performance evaluations. All of these provisions would go into effect whenever the current contracts expire. Proponents of the bill say that this brings the public sector in line with the private sector, and that Ohio's local governments are going broke from these costs. Opponents say this is an attack on middle class workers, and that public sector jobs are oftentimes more difficult (police/fire/teachers) and the health care and pension benefits are appropriate and also necessary to keep good people on the job. They also say that Republicans are trying to bust up the unions, because the unions only donate money to Democrats.

Issue 3: This issue adds a line to the state constitution that says that Ohioans cannot be compelled to purchase health care against their will. Proponents say that the federal health care law's requirement that everyone pay for insurance is unconstitutional and that the state should stand up for people's personal freedoms in this area and line up Ohioans for potential legal challenges if they so choose. Opponents say that the individual mandate is constitutional,False,self,t5_2qn7b,False,,,t3_m1gwg

Thank you for contacting me.  I appreciate hearing from you.
 
  In June 2013
 
 On June 9, 2013, U.S. prosecutors filed a criminal complaint against Mr. Snowden for the unauthorized release of classified information regarding National Security Agency (NSA) surveillance programs citing offenses concerning the theft of government property, unauthorized communication of national defense information, and willful communication of classified intelligence information with unauthorized persons.  Mr. Snowden permitted the Guardian (UK) and the Washington Post to publish his name, but fled to Hong Kong before he could be taken into custody. 
Following the media reports, and it is a great violation of the law.
 
  Furthermore, U.S. intelligence agencies (including the NSA) cannot target U.S. persons or persons located inside the United States to obtain the content of their phone calls, emails, or Internet communications.  Under the Business Records section of the PATRIOT Act, so-called ""metadata"" is collected, which consists mostly of the type of information that would appear on a customer's phone bill, such as the numbers dialed, time, unlike a telephone bill
 
 In Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, and no individual may be targeted who is located inside the United States.  The government is also expressly prohibited from targeting a foreign national with the sole intent of learning what a U.S. person is saying to that individual.  This is known as the prohibition on ""reverse targeting."" 
 
 Both programs are regularly audited by the NSA Inspector General and the Department of Justice, with full awareness of these programs, to reauthorize both provisions of law.
 
Thank you again for contacting me with your thoughts.  Please don't hesitate to inform me of your concerns in the future.  To sign up for email updates
 


Sincerely

John A. Boehner
Member of Congress

**TL;DR Invocation of Awesome LLC is a video game development company located in Columbus

Hey guys! My name is R.J. and I represent Invocation of Awesome LLC, as well as why we decided to do what we are doing.

First of all
Second, but that is one of the first things on our to-do list.

***Why Ohio?***
Simply put, due to circumstance, are unable/unwilling to go to a place like California in order to follow their dream of getting into the gaming industry, more so than almost any other city or state in the U.S. We have a team of extremely talented people already, but as we grow and expand, we believe where we are will provide us with access to an enormous pool of super talented individuals who can help us transform Columbus into a hub of gaming and game development.

**About IoA:**
Invocation of Awesome has been in the works for about eight years now. However, making our own games in our heads, and impressing our teachers with our knowledge and creativity. Finally, after we finished our schooling and expanded our talents in the coding field, we decided to make that dream a reality and created Invocation of Awesome.

We strive to live up to our name in everything we do. Simply put, and we want to make a name for ourselves in not only the gaming community, but in the artistic community as well. I think I speak for everyone I work with when I say that our life-goal is to win the nobel peace prize for uniting the world in glorious virtual combat. Reasonable, no?

So, and I couldn't imagine anyone else holding the reigns on this operation than him. We truly have a sense on what the industry is lacking, and desire nothing more than to bring it to the table and create games that are fun for us, and games that will help the industry flourish and grow even more than it already has.

Our First Title: **FantastiQuest**

FantastiQuest is the start of our dreams being realized. Its the first stepping stone to accomplishing over 8 years worth of dreams and hard work. FantastiQuest fills a role virtually untapped by the gaming industry, a sickening amount of fun.

FantastiQuest will be a 2.5D PC (and hopefully Mac) specific fighting game with an emphasis on finesse and strategy, I will say that every character currently in its later stages of development feels insanely unique and yet still incredibly well balanced.

While the main focus of FantastiQuest (and all of our games) will always be gameplay, muffin-bomb making, wrist-mounted oven gadget tickle anyone's fancy?)

*So if you are a gamer, it also helps out the industry, and the community, so thank you for your support, and we look forward to providing you with the highest grade entertainment any team of gentlemen can offer!*

* Any other recommended stops we should take along the way?
* **RIDERS** - know any great roads?
* Perhaps any places to eat in Sandusky where the park won't r*pe our wallets? 
* Is lodging at Cedar Point worth it? (I'm seeing a $34/N promo)
* How is the weather around this time? (May11) 
* Is it usually packed on opening day? I'm thinking the weather and school plays a part in a not so busy day

Thanks for your input! Looking forward to the trip!

**UPDATE** : 
Thank you to all you wicked cool Ohioans for responding to my thread! We're really excited about this trip and your advice will help 100% in making our trip go a lot smoother.

**If you cannot show up Monday

We were contacted at the 11th hour by a woman whose home has been foreclosed upon and sold at sheriff's auction to Fannie Mae. She has been working hard to secure charity and welfare funds to keep her two children (5 and 7 yr) off the street. Working with every government agency and doing the right thing.

Unfortunately her husband -who is separated from her- is the name on the mortgage

This woman and her two children are set to be kicked out of their house at 11:30 am on Tuesday 11/15 because Fannie Mae is more concerned about bureaucracy than humanity.

The woman simply asked to be allowed to PAY RENT to stay in what will otherwise become an abandoned property. Is that so much to ask? Fannie Mae has no plans of putting this property on the market any time soon. So they essentially want to kick two innocent children out in to the street for no discernable reason.

This is an urgent call to action for all regional #Occupy movements and all those who care about building a future with more justice to show up

This is a guy that doesn't know shit about courage

I live in a town with less than 20

So I'll keep this simple and cut to the chase: 

* Karl Rove is coming to my town of Niles
* I am holding an anti-war protest to answer Rove's presence here
*  Bigger crowd = more noise - get in on this and show Rove that his contributions to the wars America is now trapped in have not been forgotten

So that's it. I've made a [website](rovesucks.wordpress.com) to organize the event so get more info there if you're curious. 

If **any** political figure came to my town championing their approval of America's most recent wars I'd be doing this. So this has nothing to do with the Dem/Repub binary and everything to do with asking proponents of war one question: Why aren't you over there?

tl;dr - Karl Rove is coming to my town and he's getting a non-violent protest done on him. And this **definitely** will be a night to remember. It's been a long time coming and the anti-war cause needs to be reawakened. Join us!

I dunno how many people actually read this and are in the area, basically just a stone's throw from the Oregon District, so that's always an option if anyone is interested.

But also does anyone have any suggestions for places to just go and hang out? The bar scene seems like it'd be hard to meet many people
If anyone is interested in a small gathering
