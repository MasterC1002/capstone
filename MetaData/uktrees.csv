I'm 25 and have been a regular (more or less everyday) smoker for about 10 years. I've also had quite a bit of fun every so often with harder drugs whilst at uni. Basically I'm saying I'm not n00b.

In that time I've come across all kinds of good and bad weed

This stuff is seriously screwed and I suspect it has been laced with some kind of ~~class A

Also suggestion from the below thread which was very interesting is [AM-694](https://www.buyresearchchemicals.co.uk/cannabinoids/buy-am-694.html) or a similar AM compound. Interestingly I believe the descriptions of its sensation [here](http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=132850) are similar to what I felt but really rather horrible rather than nice. There's a particular line about there being 'something missing' in the high which I totally agree with. Also a highly speculative hypothesis as a neuroscience graduate is that an AM compund of this type responsive to a particular type of CB neuroreceptors, potentially more intense, high that focuses its effects in unfamilar ways (disassociation, numbeness etc) which are more normally associated with doing a full whitey and being really, really not nicely mashed. Also its high affinity would account for its prolonged effects (I still feel a little strange now) as this would make it harder to be removed from the synaptic cleft. Last little, weird note is I was told this strain of bud is called AMnesia, I capitalised the AM for effect

~~*People in r/trees suggested that it could have been a household chemical like Windex

These particular people sell quite small bits because the bud is always meant to be ‘high grade’ and the price usually works out at £10 a gram (which is crap compared to what it used to be back in my day). I mention this so people can understand why this may actually be cost effective to these shitheads as most people say it isn’t worth dealers spiking weed. This is true in most cases. 

So what makes me think the bud was screwed with?

- When I first smelt the weed quickly I thought it was OK and rolled up a J. It tasted of shit and nothing like it smelt.

- Also after smoking a J

- On smelling the weed again and more intensely I noticed a really chemical edge to it that actually burnt/irritated my nose.

- Licking

- The high it gives you is strong, and started looking up stuff about sprayed bud in general, thinking it was some kind of new subtle technique to add weight. About half way through I felt buzzing but not in a nice way at all. I also started feeling slightly numb at my extremities, a little bit like K can make you feel but not as strong as K.

- I then woke up this morning and did more research and went over everything again (smelling the weed

Anyway I’m going to talk to the person about this and try and trade back this shit for some proper bud. I just think this is all kinds of uncool and want other people to know so they don’t get fucked over.

**Tl;dr – It seems like laced weed does exist and is being passed round South-West London. Please upvote so people know.**

I am not an idiot and am not saying this for fun. You want it

For everyone else who would like actual weed

**Update 1:- The guy has agreed to trade it without being tricky (which makes me more suspicious)

**Update 2:- I added a whole load of crap up top about what could possible be going on, mentioned how he had sixty bags to move of this gear and it was longing him out. All of this thread is highly speculative, I get that, but I cannot stress enough that I'm not bullshitting and no matter anyone says I know that this bud tasted wrong and made me feel fucked up in no good way. We pay for bud, we all want bud, not some imitation headache-inducing horrible tasting shit. Anyways thanks so much for the upvotes, I hope no one else gets caught out,,True,t3_on8rd

Don't get me wrong, it's good to come back here and see a higher self-to-image post ratio filled with questions, answers, thought-provoking articles &amp; important news.

We've picked up a fair bit of momentum now

With any luck, we may struggle with some stereotypical posts threatening our reputation as a legitimate community, and so we may have to introduce some guidelines, but as long as we play it cool we could potentially help to shed some light on the frivolous nature of prohibition. And despite the mishaps recently with peter reynolds, we still have CLEAR fighting the cause. Hopefully within our lifetime we will see an end to this senseless war on our beloved plant.

So this one's for you guys, stories &amp; news, even created your own uktrees subreddits! And let's not forget about dhc23, who made an incredibly altruistic gesture towards the community not too long ago. Thanks to you wonderful people, our lore is writing itself, and in years to come we elders shall tell our young saplings of the great dhc donation to our family, and of the great fight to end the prohibition.


Peace &amp; Love

You see, slang and holidays. Everything a textbook subculture has. It has been around for decades and has spread across borders. The 420 notion is supported in this country, sure, but only by those who smoke cannabis and are looking for a group of people to attach themselves to based on that fact. Quiet smokers in this country (who make up the majority of the market) smoke weed, but do not typically celebrate that fact.

When someone submits a petition on epetitions and posts links asking people to sign it

In the UK we buy and smoke cannabis products in our thousands on a daily basis. There is little risk involved when one has a solid supplier

The Americans, which is absolutely crucial in political efforts. Smokers in the US identify as a unit, with common gripes and goals that seep into popular mainstream culture and into the minds of voters.

My thinking is that as the US fight intensifies

I propose that the only way we will legitimately see similar changes in the UK is through ensuring the freedoms of cannabis users in the US. British politics looks to the west for guidance on this subject and their triumphs will eventually be shared by us.

Of course

Can anyone really envision the UK legalising and controlling cannabis before we can point to an established and successfully reformed American system? What about a European effort? Can anyone see the UK taking into account the success of reform as found in Portugal

1321404775.0,mdrqn,OFFICAL UKTREES London Christmas meet up!!! 19.12.11 (Read inside),smokesallot,54,8,71,"**Important news: meet time changed to 12:00**

After several people messaging me saying they would be late I have decided to change the time. Although I'm sure some of you will want to meet at the earlier time anyway and that's fine.

**Get ready to take part the biggest UK trees meet up to ever happen.**

Following on from my original post about a London meet up at the natural history museum I have set the date for Monday the 19th of December. This will be a great opportunity to meet fellow ents

Im proposing the day should look something like this but would really like your imput on where to roam about in London:

* 10:40 - 11:00 Meet in Hyde Park at the Princess Diana memorial fountain. You can take a bus or tube so if unfamiliar with the area check what time you have to leave to get here on time. The Group should be easily recognized but I shall also give out my number over PM to people who would like it.

* 11:00 - 11:30 Get to know each whilst lighting up. Bring your finest bud to smoke and any extra you want to share. (My idea in inviting you all to this so early is so that you can save up and buy a good amount of high quality weed each.)

* 11:30-11:45 Walk the short distance to the Natural History Museum

* 11:45 - 15:55 Explore the Natural history museums many mesmerising exhibits. The museum is completely free to enter and an absolutely amazing place

*  15:55 - 16:10 Regroup and walk back to Hyde Park in time for **4:20** 

After that we could go to the south bank IMAX to watch a 3D film and then have a meal or go skating on the rink outside the museum or just hang out its completely up to you what we do.

**This is not something that you are going to want to miss so put it in your calendar and be there

[MY ADDRESS

[HIS ADDRESS

Dear [MP'S FULL NAME WITH ANY HONORIFICS

**BLOOD DRIVING LEVELS FOR CANNABIS USE**

I am writing to you to voice my concern about the pending decision to set the blood driving level of 2 ug/L for cannabis.

Regardless of whether driving in an altered state of mind is dangerous

http://www.aacc.org/publications/clin_chem/podcast/Documents/ClinChem201108_Huestis-OralFluid.pdf

My reference for this 2ug/L measurement creating a 24-day detection window is at the bottom of page 4, we've the same program with detection for a very long in the terms of 24 or more days”.

This decision effectively means that a cannabis user who has been sober for more than a fortnight could be treated the same as someone driving heavily under the influence of alcohol. As the effects of cannabis typically last at most 6 hours

My reference for the length of the effects of typical cannabis highs: 

http://norml.org/library/health-reports/item/norml-s-marijuana-health-mythology#10

Cannabis use detection in drivers is important, would be much more appropriate.

http://www.testcountry.com/drug-testing-cutoff-levels.asp

My reference for a 12-hour detection window is found under ‘Saliva Drug Testing’.

Yours Sincerely

From talking to people who've been caught for possession and reading the laws I've found out about the 3 strikes policy. The policy seems to have been introduced when cannabis was reclassified as Class C (it is now class B again) but still seems to remain in place now. 

First time - confiscation and a a telling off for being so naughty. (verbal warning only)

Second time - confiscation and a written warning (a cannabis warning that is not a criminal record and is separate from a police caution)

Third Time - Taken 'down the station' (arrest) for a police caution and possible prosecution. 

A police caution will stay on your record
I have also read that the 3 strikes have to occur within the same year to get a police caution but I am not certain on that. Does anyone know?

Would this make a good sidebar addition?

Thanks!


EDIT: Just a note saying to be polite and courteous when talking to the police as I'm sure most of them see prohibiting cannabis is a waste of time too! Plus no-one likes a dick.

EDIT 2 - No source I'm afraid

From what I've read and from what you guys have been saying cannabis policy seems to be set by the local police force to some extent. You're not going to be in much trouble the first time you're caught it seems but after that it might depend on where you live!

So I've been a weed smoker for *nearly* a year now.  Before I started smoking I was very against weed. I believed all the propaganda and lies that are spread about this wonderful plant. I've had depression nearly all my life and this is the reason I started smoking. I was sick of the anti-depressants so i took to the internet to find a more natural cure.  I tried St. Johns Wort which helped none

Anyway, I found a lot of information from American Ents. So I began smoking weed based on their advice. I didn't know anyone who smoked so all I had for information was the net.

Since I've started smoking I've met a fair few UK Ents and you've all had one thing in common. You all roll with tobacco. When I enquire as to why I've had various answers ranging from ""it burns better"" to ""it's how I was taught"". 

Curious

Now, why do you guys smoke with baccy? Do any of you plan to change or are you happy doing what you're doing?

Dear Gareth Johnson

I would like to extend my gratitude for your service to our constituency. 

I am a 26 year old professional with a passion for the betterment of mankind

Something has been troubling me recently which I wanted to highlight to you. People in your constituency are being imprisoned (that is to say locked in a cage with murderers) for owning plants. The cannabis plant has been subject to unsuccessful prohibition since 1928, as was the year before that. No substance is truly safe, (there were 6,584 deaths directly related to alcohol in 2009) however, the threat posed by cannabis is not a case for it's continued prohibition, rather they are a case for its regulation. 

The case for the regulation of cannabis is long and persuasive, job creation, removing the need for users to interact with criminals.

Prohibition has alienated communities from the police

 I hope you will give serious consideration to supporting the growing movement among the people of Britain

Yours sincerely

I feel many people in the uk dont know just how much evidence there is for medical cannabis and doubt it works or that its only for hiv/cancer patents.

Also the public know little to non on the [Endocannabinoid system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoid_system) in your body. Which is why cannabis works and has wide medical uses

1357679950.0,167ely,"A guide to using Silk Road, specifically for /r/UKtrees",Rosetti,49,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/uktrees/comments/167ely/a_guide_to_using_silk_road_specifically_for/, so I figured I’d write a guide to help anyone out.



**1. Getting on Silk Road.**

Silk Road exists on what is commonly referred to as the ‘Hidden internet’


To access Silk Road and the rest of the Hidden Internet, unzip and click Start Tor.


To head to Silk Road
silkroadvb5piz3r.onion


You’ll need to make an account
(Make sure you remember your pin. You don’t need it when logging in, mine is just another regular password)


Note: Due to the nature of the Onion network/service, hit refresh a couple of times, and then just try again later. I usually have better luck in the morning 9pm-12pm and late evening 10pm-4am


**2. Bitcoin.**

Bitcoin is a decentralised peer 2 peer based currency. Essentially

There are exchanges such as MTgox and Intersango, and as such getting money into them can be tricky. They tend not to accept debit credit cards, and often require bank transfers via IBAN. However, banks will often charge you a fee for using IBAN (I know Natwest charges £10). 

These websites will allow you to deposit money into your account


Other easier websites are [Virwox](https://www.virwox.com/)


With [Virwox](https://www.virwox.com/), which means you can easily end up being just shy of a full bitcoin and having ‘worthless’ SLL.   
One nice thing about Virwox is that they accept UKash vouchers. So if you want no trace of your purchases


[Block Chain](http://blockchain.info/) used to only be depositable via Barclay’s Pingit, so I’d recommend it.


You can also buy bitcoins in person by searching on Local bitcoin.
In addition, so I wouldn’t recommend that.


There are a tonne of places to buy bitcoin


**3. The purchasing process.**

 You need to send your purchased Bitcoins to your SR account

Once in your account, click add to cart, and then head to the checkout. Select a postage method for your items and click go to confirm the postage.

Now

Now

For this


&gt;1. Get gpg4win
2. Now you need to make your own key. Go to Keys&gt;New Key, the better, and you have to enter it every time you encrypt something). Once that's done, you have your own key.
3. Import the seller key from the seller page. To do this, and save the file. Then click 'Import' in GPA and load that file. You now have that seller's public key.
4. To encrypt your address, and in the lower box, check ""sign"" and select your own key. Then you will be prompted to enter your passcode. Once complete, copy the block from the clipboard and paste it into the address box on the shopping cart page.

I’d like to add, as it will also require you to post your public key somewhere. 


Click to confirm the transaction

It will now show up under your ‘orders’ section. You’ll notice an option to ‘finalize’. 

Silk Road uses escrow, by clicking the finalise button and sending them their payment. It’s common courtesy to do this once your item has arrived. If an issue arises, you can click resolve, and attempt to claim a refund/resolve the issue. I don’t have any experience with this so I’d recommend you search /r/silkroad for advice if you need assistance on resolving a matter.

Some vendors might ask you to finalise early before they will send your order. Now, I would say just don’t do it. You never know what’s going to happen. But generally speaking, a vendor's reputation is probably worth more than your particular order, so the risk of being 'ripped off' is low.

Still



**4. Additional Comments**

*Do I recommend it for weed?*

I started using SR Last year after I moved back home from Uni, I would choose to buy from a dealer every time. SR is a lot of hassle, so I wouldn’t recommend it for your general Eighth or quarter, unless you have no other connection (as is unfortunately the situation for me). 

However, so some of you might like to have those options.

In terms of price


*Is it risky?*

In terms of general legal risk
In terms of 'Will I get scammed risk' - it's just like ebay

Anyway, leave a comment, and I’ll do my best to help you out. 

Also, and I’ll make the necessary amendments.

And here are some other great subreddits which you may also find useful.

*Set includes:*   
Small glass bong  (21 cm tall i think)  
Stem  
4 gauze filter things + 1 used   
Plastic Grinder  
Lighter
  
All in a Luxuriously cheap carry case.

So heres the deal. I would rather it had a good home. 
Pay for shipping (i dunno it was about £5 when i ordered it)  
Post a happy picture of you enjoying the bong afterwards

This is updated because I didn't realise that people needed to make accounts to add markers when I made the last topic and I messed up. Instead of just editing my last one I'm making a new topic so people who already read the last topic and won't go back can see this.

So

Username: UkEnts

Password: uktreeslogin

[Here's the link to the actual map where you can login and add points.](http://www.communitywalk.com/smoke_spots_uk/map/1497259)

Last new point, do that.

[Copied details from my last topic:

Basically I thought it would be good to have a list of good smoke spots in the UK on a map so we could enjoy them. The map is only available if you have the link so you won't get random people going to your spots, and even if they do it's really just a list of nice spots to chill out, regardless of if people smoke or not so they aren't going to send police to patrol parks or whatever.

The map would be good as people new to an area can find some good spots and even people who have lived in a city their entire life can too.

To add a marker: just hit add marker and click where you want, places to eat nearby, little hidden gems near it or whatever.

The USA has always been a huge influence on drug policy across the world. As more and more states move towards legalisation

I think that the effort you make towards decriminalisation in the uk at the moment will carry more momentum than ever before

I just wrote an email to my MP

You can copy it if you want. (i actually copied it from some web link i found on here earlier and changed it a bit).



Dear [name]

I am writing to you as my MP because I want you to help me.

I am dismayed that David Cameron dismissed the recent HASC drugs inquiry report out of hand and then the next day admitted he hadn’t even read it. What is the point of expensive inquiries like this and Leveson if the government is just going to disregard their findings and recommendations?

All over the world, decriminalisation of drugs has decreased addiction rates, decreased drug related violent crime, decreased the costs of policing, and decreased the spread of harmful viruses like HIV that cost the NHS millions every year, to name but a few benefits.

I don't advocate the adoption of these exact policies in the UK, David Cameron and the UK government have outright refused to even consider the recommendations given to them by a scientific enquiry.

Please will you tell me exactly what you will do to make sure this issue is properly addressed? Or in the case that you think it shouldn't be addressed

Yours sincerely [name]

I am writing somewhat informally in order to calculate your stand point on the prohibition of Marijuana as well as your view to the future of what is rapidly becoming quite a hot topic. I am a member of a group you have probably heard of, for all intent and purposes an argument difficult to disagree with. Yet the government still turns a blind eye to the obvious ludicrousness of this dated law. The question i want to put to you is, to what end ? Why is this illegal ? Why is something that can help the sick and the people that are in pain illegal ? Is it because the government can happily sit there and watch members of their society suffer in order to save face ?
 Why is a plant, if it was regulated and taxed at £1.00 a gram. £1.00 a gram ! and the government would reap the reward and be able to aid the country in any number of ways. Why is that illegal ? Is it because the government currently has to much money ? Is it because we are economically comfortable and really don't need the money that bad ? I suspect not. 
I know there is one excuse that the government has managed to hide behind for quite some time, You would need to STOP 2800 heavy users of Marijuana or 30,000 light users EVER using Marijuana in order stop ONE case of schizophrenia. 
It also suggested that annual hospital admissions for mental and behavioral disorders relating to Cannabis average at 750 cases per year. 750 is still quite alot though right ? Well lets compare it to the stats against Alcohol, used and abused by, lets face it, at some point or another 99% of our country, Alcohol causes an annual hospital admission rate of 47,000 suffering from mental and behavioral disorders. 47,000 cases of mental and behavioral disorders at the hands of a drug the government deems ok. 

As i sit here
It's not simply all about stats and facts Mr Hoban, governments and people in power (similar to yourself) have tarred the issue, surrounded it with lies and propaganda and force fed the population this concoction of deceit, a population who have mindlessly swallowed it with nothing more than a smile. 
Unfortunately opinions are beginning to change. People are starting to realize the ludicrousy of it. And things will change. Its an issue of time. 

I look forward to reading your re-post and potentially meeting with yourself.

Thank you for your e-mail about drugs policy. Drugs policy is an emotive and complex issue with many contradictory views
 
Having seen the damage that illegal drugs does first hand in the constituency
 
I am particularly concerned by the significant amount of scientific evidence of cannabis harm and the rising numbers of cannabis users seeking medical treatment
 
Professor Peter Jones of Cambridge University, 'Cannabis is a huge issue for psychiatric services at this moment. I work in a first-contact schizophrenia service and it might as well be a Cannabis Dependency Unit'.
 
He warned that children of 10 or 11 who start smoking the drug could be trebling their risk of schizophrenia. He said that 80% of first episode psychiatric disorders
 
Cannabis is a proven independent risk factor for psychosis. Patients can continue to need anti psychotic medication for life as I am sure many clinical psychiatrists would confirm.
 
I am also concerned by people advocating the decriminalisation of a drug 20 times more cancerous than tobacco at the very time the law is being tightened on cigarette sales through display bans
 
I believe that reducing demand for drugs through controls and prevention will do most to help the problem here at home and most to reduce the scale of the international market and problem. The simple fact is that drug use is stable and has declined significantly since the 1990s. Even cocaine use after doubling over the last decade is losing its allure and has begun to drop.
 
The fact is that drug use is a risky minority activity that most people do not have a taste for. Compared with the 20 per cent plus of all adults who smoke (just about still legal) only 7 per cent of adults used cannabis (ever) last year and even fewer
 
There is only one responsible discussion to be had on drugs. That is the urgent need to bring down drug use and the demand for drugs
 
Yours sincerely
 
 
Michael McCann MP
Member of Parliament for East Kilbride

1352989640.0,138nhe,10 Reasons to smoke without tobacco and some words from Prof David Nutt,toffilata,54,19,61,"So this is obviously a matter of personal choice

Let's not forget tobacco killed 100

1. ""It saves me money"". No it doesn't. Firstly you have to shell out a fiver on baccy every week/month which you would not otherwise have to spend.

2. ""It burns better."" If your weed is properly dried (which most I see is nowadays) it will burn perfectly well in a pure joint. If damp

3. ""It saves weed"" - again not true for a few reasons. It tars up your lungs making them less efficient at gas transfer - hence it's harder to absorb the THC to get high.

4. The fact you are mixing it with an addictive drug means you often re-dose (roll another!) when you're still perfectly stoned. Your brain will come to associate weed and tobacco

5. Recurrent chest infection. Anyone who smokes tobacco will get more chest infections. Ever find these stick around or become a chronic cough? That's the baccy

6. Baccy stinks the house out more.

7. ""It tastes better."" Trust me it doesn't it just stops your ability to taste. Why not actually taste the strain of weed your smoking. A nice lemon haze? Then what's the point of ruining it with a generic tobacco ash flavour which also ruins the taste of your munchies.

8. You're smoking more plant matter than you have to. Cannabis can damage the lungs

9. ""Tobacco smokes smoother."" OK so pure weed might give you more of a tickly cough. That's because the tobacco us killing off the nerve endings that would normally make you cough. It also shut's down your airways

10. ""It makes it easier to share."" I disagree. It does make it easier to hide that fact you're using a tiny amont of weed. It does make a joint look more impressive in a big group. But really what's the point in packing out a joint with nonpsychoactive

I finally managed to give up the tabacco habit this summer. It does take a degree of willpower

As some one who has done both

Sometimes when we make excuses to continue using tobacco

Go on

""The best evidence-based advice to help cannabis smokers look after their lungs would be to abandon the peculiar British habit of mixing cannabis with tobacco.”

Professor David Nutt

The front door was unlocked and the police walked straight in. Someone shouted 'You can't just walk in' and the officer who was playing the 'bad cop' role replied 'we can do whatever we want - we know the law, and space-case grinder for themselves because they said that they wouldn't be pressing charges (as that would require them to document what they had seized)

I'm pretty sure they were allowed in (since the door was unlocked) but the sheer arrogance was enough to make me want to start this project anyway. 

I'm a graphic designer by day

The below is from my experience over the years

*Home*
&gt; The police need a warrant to enter your house, then they can just walk straight in. If the door is unlocked during a party they can walk in and say that they chapped but you never heard.

*Automobile*
&gt; The police must have reasonable cause to search your car

*Person*
&gt; The police must have reasonable cause to search you. But this reasonable cause can include things like you looking nervous

The challenge: To roll a smokable spliff without using your thumbs. 

Rules: No thumbs until the joint has been stubbed. You can use items (cards

Tips: Be prepared to make a mess.


We started off small to get a feel for it, some of which worked, some of which failed hilariously. Im not gonna give any away cus I want to imagine you working shit out like I did. It took me just under 45 mins to roll and spark up mine but was worth it.

1356888446.0,15ogaz,UK Cannabis Social Clubs - Are you a part of your local Cannabis community?,StealthProctologist,31,4,16,"Hey r/uktrees

I'm sure there are many of you out there that know all about the UKCSC movement but right now I don't think it's getting the full attention it deserves *(maybe a [link](http://cannabiscure.co.uk/uk-cannabis-social-clubs-list-ukcsc-2/) in the sidebar could give it a helping hand, get involved in any way they can and help shape the future of Cannabis activism. For those of you that haven't heard of the UKCSC movement, you can find out more about it and find your local UKCSC facebook page [right here](http://cannabiscure.co.uk/uk-cannabis-social-clubs-list-ukcsc-2/) but I've put together a little FAQ, mostly paraphrased from that page anyway but it should cover the basics:

*What is a UKCSC?*

United Kingdom Cannabis Social Club - A place for Cannabis consumers from all walks of life to discuss any and every Cannabis related issue

*When did the UKCSC movement begin?*

The UKCSC movement established itself in 2011 by a small number of activists spread out across England

*What does a Cannabis Social Club do?*

That depends on the club - right now there are a handful of UKCSC's out there organizing regular local meetings

*How can I join my local CSC?*

Select the closest CSC page from [this list](http://cannabiscure.co.uk/uk-cannabis-social-clubs-list-ukcsc-2/) and join their facebook page. I know some CSC's are on the look out for admins at the moment so if you're interesting in getting involved directly then please enquire with your local CSC about it.

Unfortunately the UKCSC pages are only on facebook for now so it's understandable if you don't want to associate your profile with something that, they wouldn't have been able to get the ball rolling as quickly as they have.

I probably haven't covered all bases (might be something to do with this wonderful Grape Ape I've been smoking all afternoon) but if you have any questions about the UKCSC movement I'd be more than happy to help.

Thank you for reading and happy toking!

There is to much to list but I'll choose some favourites:

Me and my buddies went to tesco and got a whole chicken

Beans on toast with cheese never fails to please! Cheap and easy.

A classics English fry up after a wake and bake is a fantastic experience.

I like to make huge omelettes and cut it into slices. I use up to ten eggs

As an Englishman i always love a curry and a curry when your baked is even better :)

the pcso's then radio'd the proper police for them to come and finish the job off, then one asked what aspirations i had, i told him i wanted to be a paramedic, he kicked off with the ""noone who smokes weed is successful"" bullshit. I had to stop him there.

I told him lots of people are successful who smoke weed such as Richard Branson

eventually the cops rolled up, they then asked who my friend was rolling the joint for, i told them for me only. I'm in the shit no matter what anyway, and my friend is 17, so his parents would find out so i thought there was no point dragging my friend down with me, so they just let him off.

in the end, but not my grinder and let on my way. As we were off, the pcso that was talking shite before shouted as he was getting in the car ""Richard Branson eh? Pick a better role-model!""

As im walking along the main road i see a car doing some bizarre things up ahead so coming up to it im a little bit cautious. The car turned down a side street, where im going, what i have been doing and have a been ""snooping around anyone's houses"" as they've apparently been having burglary's in the area....which i doubt.
I answered all his questions fine, to which i said yes. 
Then he obviously wanted to search me. I told him sure but i have some weed on me, my socks for crying out loud ! All at like 1:30am now, stood on the side of the road.

While all this was going on i was being talked at by his partner who was telling me that she's seen ""people hiding under tables because they are scared of someone coming to get them.....because of weed !!"" as well gems such as ""people will burgle house's to feed they;re addiction.......to weed!!"" ""I've seen people your age forget who their parents are.....because of weed!!!"" 
Absolute fucking rubbish. I told her so in no uncertain terms. I literally went on a 10 minute rant explain how shes wasting my time as well as their time considering im hurting no one. Compared to the amount of problems they get with alcohol me walking home quietly with a bit of weed in my bag and because of that simple fact im the criminal.
So they issued me with a fucking street warning. Took my weed (5-6 grams in a 420 science airtight jar) took my grinder
Now im either going to have to stop smoking all together or simply only smoke at home and never carry shit with me. I'm trying to get a visa to Australia and really could have done without this pointless situation that could be avoided if anyone in this country had one modicum of sense.

London-based Ent here, so I have a few uktrees based questions that I'm hoping you folks can sort me out on! For reasons explained below this is unfortunately a throwaway, though I am an active reader of this subreddit on my main acct... ;) 


I realize that some of the answers to these Q's are pretty subjective and that some of my questions are fairly ""vancouver-centric""


---

1). You guys seem to call your trees different things than we do back home. Here's what I have summarized for myself - tell me what I've got wrong: 

""Haze"": Typically comes from amsterdam. Least potent?

""Cheese"": still haven't figured out what this is. Medium potent? A generic term for bud? 

""Skunk"": This is genetically modified
Back home we used to just refer to trees as ""skunky"" in either a good way (""That shit smells skunky as hell. It's going to be potent"")


---

2). From browsing these forums, they give it to you exactly, and the price is what is negotiable, based on quality"".

---


3). What if I only want high quality? What am I looking for? ""Skunk""? ""Haze""? Let's say that I don't really care about price (or rather


---

4). I've read stories of people spraying all kinds of shit on their trees in order to increase weight... Sand... Sugar... Glass shards (wtf!). Is this common or is it sensationalist BS? 


---

5). Hash! We don't really have much of this back home... We mostly roll our joints from pure bud, other than to say ""That seems really hardcore!""... ;)

If we can lock them in a room for whatever time it takes and force them to discuss it we can get results. In the past, nothing might come out of it but we need optimism for this. I see truly British pessimism in [/r/uktrees](/r/uktrees) which is pretty much stereotypical of us but come on.
