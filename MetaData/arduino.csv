1357577822.0,164kp2,As promised I have opened the source to my quad copter project,,163,22,31,"https://github.com/mikeshub/openCopter

The long awaited opening of my project’s source is finally here. Sorry no video this time. My copilot is taking his sweet time getting me the video. But I promise there is a crash (got to give my fans what they want to see). I was taking it upside down then switching it to self-level mode. On one of the attempts my finger missed the switch and it hit the ground really hard. No major damage though

There are two versions of this software. One is the full system that with a lot of patience and effort it can be made to loiter on GPS. The light version will run in rate mode or self-leveling mode. I have been having a giant amount of trouble getting loiter to work really well. The flight test before last I thought that I was just about there. I had it staying in an about 2 square meter box.  This last time I couldn’t get close to that. As best I can determine it is because I need to take the time and do the full soft and hard iron calibration of the compass. Heading hold will work without that calibration. The full version will only work on a MEGA. With some minor changes it could be made to run on a Due. One would have to change the timer syntax as well as the macros I use for the SS lines. The GPS I am using is the UBLOX running in binary mode.

The light version could be used on an UNO or similar, the ports for the RC serial lines would need to switched, etc.

The PID loops are different than the standard PID loop. A friend of mine was nice enough to model a quad for me in MATLAB so it could be tuned more easily (and I already asked

http://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/slref/pidcontroller.html

That is where the filter coefficient comes in. As best I can tell a lower coefficient is more like a raw derivative term and a higher coefficient term will have more filtering. Hopefully we have a controls guy who lurks around here and can either confirm or deny my assumption.
The tunings well with my DJI 450 frame that uses 30A ESCs

Any RC transmitter can be used. SBUS

My main goal of this project was to make this code easy to read and easy to understand. I think very highly of the work done by the multiWii  guys and the arduPilot guys

If you decided to try this code I will be happy to help you with drivers for other sensors or clarification about bits and pieces. This code has no failsafe in it right now (shame on me). I cannot stress how dangerous these things can be. If you try this code

Next I am going to do some PCB design (after incorporating some robust failsafe routines of course). I am going to make a breakout board for the openIMU running all the sensors on the SPI bus. I am going to make a shield for the MEGA that will work with the full version of this software. And if I get really adventurous I am going to make an all in one FC unit. And I might try to monetize that part of the project if my results are good enough. I am also going to port the code to some of the more popular AVR based flight controllers like multiWii and possibly the KK boards. I am also thinking about starting a website for this project. I’ll be happy to answer any questions and I hope this helps someone out.

He actively believed in open source, potentially for generations to come, and lead them to improve on his work and his design, thus keeping his legacy alive and sparking.

- 7805, 9V, 12V)(maybe even pickup a 3.3V)

- lm317 adjustable voltage regulator

- Battery Connectors/packs

- 555 timer

- lm324(or lm338) op-amps(possibly others for higher speeds or other requirements)

- comparators (op amps can be used as comparators as well)

- assortment of switches(momentary, etc...)

- 5V dpdt relays

- assortment of linear(NOT audio) potentiometers(1k or 10k are typically fine)

- 7 segment displays(common anode are usually better choice)

- assortment of logic gate ics (AND, NOR, XOR, NOT(inverters)) 

- schmitt triggers

- light dependent resistors(change resistance with light intensity)

- photo diodes

- opto couplers

- Other transistors like tip120(darlington), some PNP variants

- FETs(enhancement mode and depletion mode)

- shift registers(less common but have uses

- (Possibly) dc to dc step up/down converters

So, which I believe is quite a deal.

While I'm at it, a prototype shield with a mini breadboard, a large breadboard, jumper cables, 9V battery with adapter, remote control, 7 segment displays and a LOT of components, [a prototype shield with a mini breadboard for $6.75](http://www.buyincoins.com/details/prototype-prototyping-shield-protoshield-mini-breadboard-for-arduino-duemilanove-product-11855.html)

They also have great deals on some general stuff that might be useful

By the way

I believe that's about it about BuyInCoins. They aren't the only place for cheap Arduino stuff though. DealExtreme also has some, but not nearly as cheap as BuyInCoins. DX might have some accessories that BIC doesn't have though, be sure to do a search.

One thing that DX has that BIC doesn't (if you don't buy it in a kit) are jumper cables. DX has a nice set of [65 jumper cables for $3.20](http://www.dealextreme.com/p/breadboard-jumper-wires-for-electronic-diy-65-cable-pack-118826?r=66422016). Maker Shed has similar cables they call ""deluxe jumper cables"" and charge $9.

So, but sell the same LED's for $1.09 on eBay (320627696437), still with free shipping.

There are two things you have to keep in mind when ordering from China:

* Shipping might take a while. 2 weeks is to be expected.
* Customs might add charges.

OK so I know I could take off the shelf code and run it to fly my quad copter. But where is the fun in that? Also

That's the full setup sans gumstix. The arduino communicates with the cypress via a SPI link. Here is the quad copter:

It flies badly right now. I need to tweak the gains on my PID loops. Since I don't have a plant model for the quad I'm just guessing based on what my pilot tells me (I suck at flying). Not plant model means the typical stability analysis methods don't work. To make that be not just an enormous pain I decided to use an XBEE link to transmit the gains:

It is a pretty simple space invader type of game played on a 16X2 LCD using a Wii Nunchuk as a controller (joystick left/right to control the gun and Z button to shoot).  I've managed to add a difficulty selection and multiple types of enemies that change as your score increases, I just can't come up with a melody that I like (probably related to my incredible lack of musical ability).

The game is played to 10 points (score displayed upper right) at which point it displays your time to win.  You start off with 9 shots (count displayed bottom right)

Anyone should feel free to download the code if you want to try and play it on your own.  If you don't have a WiiChuk Adapter I think it would be a pretty simple rewrite to make it work with either 3 push buttons

1325831074.0,o5443,So you want an easy way to save power?,Zomgondo,55,4,27,"Since someone asked about ways to save power, this is it:

    #include &lt;io.h&gt;
    ...
    /*
      lpDelay(quarterSeconds) - Low Power Delay.  Drops the system clock
                                to its lowest setting and sleeps for 256*quarterSeconds milliseconds.
    */
    int lpDelay(int quarterSeconds) {
      int oldClkPr = CLKPR;  // save old system clock prescale
      CLKPR = 0x80;    // Tell the AtMega we want to change the system clock
      CLKPR = 0x08;    // 1/256 prescaler = 60KHz for a 16MHz crystal
      delay(quarterSeconds);  // since the clock is slowed way down
      CLKPR = 0x80;    // Tell the AtMega we want to change the system clock
      CLKPR = oldClkPr;    // Restore old system clock prescale
    }

Just to repeat the comments, use **lpDelay(4)**, not lpDelay(1000).

The other caveat is that this probably won't work if you're reading from the serial port.  Writing to the serial port should work fine.

Anyway, so with this you get pretty close to the minimum without resorting to any hocus pocus at all.

It can:  
- set off alarm via buzzer
- support analog sound sensors (sound level over certain threshold if system is active will cause alarm)  
- support IR distance sensors (if distance sensor goes low
- support window sensors (built into some windows already to change a connection inside internal wires when window goes open)  
- be switched on/off by RFID (with certain time for the system to be deactivated via RFID before alarm goes off)  
- light LEDs appropriately

The *proper* solution: Hire competent security guards. Out of the question.


**TL;WR:** *My* solution: A [Parallax RFID Card Reader](http://www.parallax.com/tabid/768/ProductID/114/Default.aspx) sitting [in a key cabinet](http://imgur.com/X28FA.jpg) which is constantly [polling the presence of an RFID-Tag](http://imgur.com/rWeg6.jpg) which the master key is permanently affixed to [connected to](http://imgur.com/Hrpdf.jpg) an Arduino Duemilanove in a conduit [hidden](http://imgur.com/6qryQ.jpg) underneath the desk.

[Here is my schematic](http://imgur.com/yC5RN.jpg). (I think Pins 3/4 in the schematic are switched in terms of which one is grounded and code. Check your optoisolator for polarity.) I built my own [makeshift shield](http://imgur.com/CVNoM.jpg) (one [with flash](http://imgur.com/gazJh.jpg)) The green wire goes to a door-buzzing system which needs to be hooked up to an optoisolator since the door system also deals with the fire panel... I did not want to create a ground loop since I'm not a fire panel tech. When the anode receives signal that the door is being buzzed

This triggers the arduino to serial.println the number ""4"" to the desk computer

Likewise, which prompts my security guards to justify a reason for. Once this is done, if the key is returned, serial.println ""2"" to trigger processing to run my keyIn.vbs file, which silently (but appropriately) appends ""key returned"" to the Event Log in Outlook.

If the key is not returned, but the beep ain't botherin him!) When minsawol reaches 120 (roughly 2 hours) it triggers serial.println ""3"" which signals Processing to execute keyAWOL.vbs...

keyAWOL.vbs silently sends an e-mail to my cell-phone-carriers' email-to-text-message address (##########@txt.att.net) where I have notification that the keys have been missing for 2 hours. At the point,,False,,t5_2qknj,True,,True
1294798883.0,f0md2,How does /r/Arduino feel about a subreddit wide contest with awesome prizes?,sptrks,59,13,32,"I got this idea to start a contest for all /r/Arduino members. I really think a fun and involved contest would be really good for this subreddit. First of all it would be fun to see what everyone makes. Secondly I have some awesome prizes that I can put up for grabs. Third(ly?) something like this will help this subreddit in a number of ways:


* It will get lurkers actively involved in creating and learning
* Promote user contributed projects and documentation
* Possibly expand the member base of our little community
* And most importantly show that anyone is capable of making interesting projects


My hidden agenda also includes using this contest to catapult my earlier idea of a community run repository of knowledge that would include fully documented projects


So what does everyone think? If only a few people are interested I am not going to waste the energy. However

So **if** you are in fact interested this is what I had planned. Register a blog with Blogger or some other blogging service. Keep it and this subreddit updated with projects and competition deadline statuses. We can treat the website as our temporary repository of projects and we can go from there. 

Contest wise this is what I had envisioned: 

* The contest will consist of making something awesome/crazy/original with the Arduino. 

* Submissions **MUST** include full documentation. 

* Opening up different ways of winning. This would allow other users besides the EE graduate to win something fun. 

* Have all the projects in by a deadline. Projects will full documentation will be posed in this subreddit and the top  voted projects in the different categories will win.

* Profit??



So in conclusion

**EDIT 1** What kind of categories do you want to win prizes? For the grand prize I am willing to give away an unopened [TI eZ430 Chronos Watch Development Kit](http://focus.ti.com/docs/toolsw/folders/print/ez430-chronos.html?DCMP=Chronos&amp;HQS=Other+OT+chronos). The other prize that I had in mind was an unopened TI LaunchPad. If others want to put forth other rewards we can have more categories / more prizes.

* Highest vote project
* Best documentation
* Most original

**EDIT 2** Alright I have class shortly. After school and work I will get the website set up and work on some technical details of the contest. Still looking for other members who would like to donate prizes. ",,t5_2qknj,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/f0md2/how_does_rarduino_feel_about_a_subreddit_wide/

Explanations are mostly in the source code, using two continuous rotation servos, an accelerometer, and a gyro. A PID control algorithm is utilized, and each of the three controlling constants (proportional, derivative, integral) can be tuned with the side mounted potentiometers.

This is really limited by the wimpy servo motors

The robot works better on carpet than hardwood floor, but I haven't been able to achieve this.

I added a DS1307 real time clock and a daylight savings mode as well as tidying up the code and making it display a more proper ""a quarter to/past"" instead of just ""quarter to/past"".

Ive always hated having to reset the time every time the clocks go forward or backward an hour so I added a daylight savings mode which when activated adds one hour. 

I first made this clock without the DS1307 but it was off by a minute or two each hour and well thats not great for a clock. the DS1307 only drifts a few minutes a month so I dont mind that so much

a parts list is below

 * ds1307 rtc + crystal + 3v battery
 * atmga328 plus related hardware
 * 3 HCF4094 shift registers
 * 3 ULN2003A transistor arrays 
 * 3 buttons
 * A 5v regulator circuit E.G. 5v reg + diode 1n4001 + 10uf cap + 100uf
 * 98 LEDs and 98 1K resistors
 * some 9 way ribbon cable

For my Bachelor's thesis I worked on a project which would allow the use of an Arduino board as a data acquisition device along with integration with MATLAB's Data Acquisition Toolbox. What this means is that

As an example

    ai = analoginput('etfarduino'
    addchannel(ai
    start(ai);
    wait(ai
    [data
    plot(t

I have achieved a single-channel sample rate of 12.5 kHz which is also a pretty good result for a ~$30 device. Analog output and digital output are also supported in this version. For now

For now

I believe this project could be useful to a lot of people

I have published it under the MIT licence on [github](https://github.com/mlalic/etfarduino). For any feedback regarding anything at all -- bugs, as it is licensed under MIT, feel free to contribute to the project or use it anyway you wish, providing the appropriate copyright text.

Obviously these locks are low to no security (just keep the honest people honest)

The prototype is extremely crude since I am in the beginning stages of testing.

So far is works pretty well.

This consists of the following:
Arduino clone Mega2560
L298 based dual channel motor controller
Stepper motor (9 degree steps)
20x2 LCD
3 momentary push-buttons (reset
4049 bounceless switch circuit
Linear actuator (designed for automotive locks)
Cherry switch with hisker 

Upon startup

It runs through a methodically reduced set of possible combinations (based on the test performed earlier). After each combo is tested, the  open shackle is detected by the whisker cherry switch and the combo is displayed on the LCD and the process remains at idle.

It will take this thing up to 45 minutes to try all possible combinations before it gives up.

I have a lot more work ahead of me

For this lock, 26 and the autodialer gave the combo 22.5, 2.5, 26.5 after about 25 minutes of running (which also works). The divergence is due to the sloppiness of the lock design (again, these locks provide little to no real security anyway).

Something that is a bit mysterious is the presence of the higher harmonics in the output data when I'm only delivering a pure sine wave. I imagine they are the result of the janky setup or the subwoofer itself and not an actual issue with the accelerometer.

1332783810.0,reh4h,Arduino-Powered Foosball Scoreboard,skootles,41,7,14,"So at our office

Like any other foosball table, but we were always just talking out of our asses. They all seemed like cool ideas but they never really evolved beyond that - ideas. Last christmas however, I received an Arduino Uno and starter kit as a gift. I knew right away what my first project was going to be. 

-------

Fast-forward to today, which you can see here:
 
http://imgur.com/a/i3PgX#0

Now

Inside that unit are 8 two-digit seven-segment displays for the score (2 players

Powering those displays is an Arduino Uno with four 595 shift registers. This allows me to run all of the displays off of only 3 pins. Also attached to this unit is an RF receiver.

One of the things we wanted to do was completely automate the scoring. To do this, and the Arduino sends an RF signal to the unit hanging above the table, which adds to the score.

I also decided to add manual score buttons. I don't want to undermine my own abilities, the trip sensors stopped working. So there are some score buttons, a reset score button, and a switch to turn the lasers on/off to save batteries.

I made a video showing how the unit works. It's not that long

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ4HjjtZoX8

So... yeah

Things I plan to change / add in the next version:

- Get the TIME digits hooked up and working.
- Add an auto-shutoff for the displays after
- Add an auto-shutoff for the unit under the table.

**TL;DR: My first Arduino project: an Arduino-powered scoreboard.**

Then we drilled holes to the lasers and the lasers were in place. On the wall on the other side we put [these](http://www.futurlec.com/Photocells.shtml) up where the lasers made a red spot. We added a couple of piezos
The deal is that you had to reach the button of the room without breaking the laser beam. Then you had to push the button and the led matrix would show a number. Breaking the laserbeam would result in the piezos going crazy and only a push on the button at the start of the room would make the piezos stop.

- atm. pressure sensor 
- SD card module to log all data to SD card
- GPS module to record flight path and clock info (date/time)
- Motorola C168 interfaced to send SMS with GPS location
- Atmospheric balloons
- Camera with auto shutter to take pictures

What I don't have:

- Another way of finding the balloon if GSM/GPS fails
- Parachute
- The box itselt
- Emergency release mechanism 
- Power

For the parachute I want to use a model rocket parachute which will be pre-opened during ascent so it will not fail while falling. 

For the box I want to use a modified styrofoam food box. All sensors/antennas will be placed outside. One temp sensor will stay inside the box to measure conditions for electronics. 

I don't really know what mechanism to use to cut the line if the balloon won't pop. Any ideas here?

The same goes for other means of locating the cargo once it hits ground. I thought about radio location but I don't really know a lot about radio communication. Would a transmitter/reciever with directional antenna be difficult to build ?

So I decided to learn a bit about electronics

So I ordered a 'quick start' pack from the Makers Shed

So today the package arrived and I got started. The first 'blink' program went off without a hitch

The code is no problem (I work with javascript quite a bit; it's not that much different)

I remembered reading somewhere that LEDs need a resistor to work, wire the LEDs up and download the code.

And it works! Well, ""too much resistance!"" So I try another one (red-red-black-black-brown) and it works much better. But the other LED is still brighter. So I add a resistor (with the same markings) to that circuit, too.

Now I'm sitting with a pile of wires and electronic bits on my desk

That someone with so little knowledge was able to do this in just a matter of minutes is absolutely amazing. I can't wait to keep learning and get lost in everything this little gizmo can do.

I'd already had a play with photoresistors so I just made 4 of those circuits layed out on a cross made from coffee stirrer sticks. They are driven from the 5v out on the arduino board and share a common ground. I plugged the sensor returns into A0-A4.

My idea is to start with an existing RC quadcopter (like [this one](http://www.amazon.com/Syma-Channel-2-4G-Quad-Copter/dp/B0096SJU3U)) and hack an Arduino into it along with a [wireless charging system](http://www.amazon.com/Palm-Pre-Touchstone-Charging-Kit/dp/B002CMEIWU/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357771919&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=palm+touchstone).

My first goal would be to have the arduino board tap into the directional controls on the quadcopter as if the commands were coming from the RC remote

My second goal would be to figure out how to get the quadcopter to follow things. It would need to lock on to a signal beacon and then move towards it. Roombas are able to do this when docking with their charging station. What kind of beacon system do they use?

My third goal would be to figure out a way to add proximity sensors so the quadcopter will try to avoid obstacles while moving on a set path. The best solution would be to use a camera so the quadcopter could be proactive in choosing flight paths instead of reactive to sensors

Just a little discussion that I think might help some people wanting to do IMU based controls. First off I am using the very popular MinIMU – 9 from the good people at pololu robotic. I cannot say enough good stuff about these guys. They have great support and are very helpful.

http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/1268

They even wrote a library to interface with the device! Which is all well and good but it uses wire.h and wire.h doesn’t have timeouts. I modified their libraries to use the better i2c.h library which has timeouts. I have verified that it works with the MinIMU-9 v1 but not with the v2. If you aren’t doing something like flying a helicopter with these sensors just use the libraries they wrote that use wire.h.  Here is my IDE with all the libraries I like to use:

https://dl.dropbox.com/u/21439374/arduino-1.0.1.zip

This current robot uses two megas and 4 xbees. One xbee link is used for communication between the arduino and the other link provides the data stream. I use real term to send the commands to the controlling arduino.
IMUs can be complicated messes which are really hard to understand. You have Kalman filters (IE black magic) direction cosine matrices (easier to understand but processor intensive and still a little bit of black magic) and then the complimentary filter (easy to understand, roll, and yaw with regard to the earth frame of reference. First, obviously, you get the data off the device:

    void GetIMUData(){
      compass.read();
      gyro.read();
    
      magYaw = compass.heading((LSM3032::vector){1
    
      accX = compass.a.x ;
      accY = -1*compass.a.y;
      accZ = -1*compass.a.z ;
    
      gyroX = 0.07*(gyro.g.x);
      gyroY = 0.07*(gyro.g.y);
      gyroZ = 0.07*(gyro.g.z);

      accPitch = ToDeg(atan2(accX
      accRoll = ToDeg(atan2(accY
    
    }

Luckily the libraries I modified which were provided by pololu do the hard stuff for you. And the magnetometer &amp; accelerometer library includes a function to give you a tilt compensated heading. To get the accelerometer raw heading you just take the inverse tangent as shown there. Notice the signs on accY and accX. It is good practice to use the aircraft conventions anytime you are working with Euler angles. Also notice that the gyro has been scaled in accordance with the data sheet so that 1dps will correspond with one digit. OK now we have the data next we need to fuse the sensors. 

    void Complementary(){
    
      a = tau1/(tau1+dt);
      b = tau2/(tau2+dt);
      //port1&lt;&lt;millis()&lt;&lt;"",""&lt;&lt;tau1&lt;&lt;"",""&lt;&lt;tau2&lt;&lt;""\r\n"";
      pitch = a*(pitch + gyroY * dt) + (1-a) * accPitch;
      roll = a*(roll + gyroX*dt) + (1-a) * accRoll;
    
      yawPredict = yaw + gyroZ*dt;
    
      if (abs(yawPredict-magYaw)&lt;90){
        yaw = b*(yawPredict) + (1-b) * magYaw;
      }
      else{
        yaw = yawPredict;
      }
    
      //yaw = b*(yaw + gyroZ*dt) + (1-b) * magYaw;
      if (yaw &gt; 360){
        yaw -= 360;
      }
      if (yaw &lt; 0){
        yaw += 360;
      }
    }


OK now it would work to just do

      pitch = 0.95*(pitch + gyroY * dt) + 0.05 * accPitch;

But including your calculated dt will give you better results. The 0 / 360 singularity is handled by integrating the gyro. This gives us a rough estimate of the angle. Then I check to see if we have crossed the singularity. When that is the case I run just off the gyro and take it to the correct value. Not to complicated. But now how to implement a PID loop with this problem? I did a bit of research into the matter and people just kept saying quaternions DCM etc etc but not a single word as to how one runs a PID loop based off quaternions. So it was time to use my brain. There are essentially three states in the process. Not crossing the singularity

    void PID(){
    
    
      PIDAngle = yaw;
      error = yawSetPoint - PIDAngle;
    
      errorDifference = previousError - error;//check to see if singularity has been crossed
    
      if (errorDifference &gt; 180){
        singularityState = 1;
      }
      if (errorDifference &lt; -180){
        singularityState = 2;
      }
    
      switch (singularityState){//needs some cleanup
      case 0:
        break;
      case 1:
        if (yaw &gt; 270){
          PIDAngle = yaw -360;
          error = yawSetPoint - PIDAngle;
        }
        
        break;
      case 2:
        if (yaw &lt; 90){
          PIDAngle = yaw  +360;
          error = yawSetPoint - PIDAngle;
        }
       
        break;
      }
    
      iError += dt*ki*error;
      if (iError &gt; 100){//windup guard
        iError = 100;
      }
      
      if (iError &lt; -100){
        iError = -100;
      }
    
      dError = (PIDAngle - previousYaw)/dt;//treat setpoint as constant
    
      adjustment = kp*error + iError - kd*dError;
      
      if (abs(error) &lt; 1){
          singularityState = 0;
          holding = true;
          
          debugFlag = 5;
        }
      
      previousError = error;
      previousYaw = PIDAngle;
    
    }


I was so happy when I ran this code. One of my commands is to just rotate to a specific angle. It worked. The PID loop took the shortest path around the circle each time and also crossed the singularity with no problems! Don’t get me wrong here there are still a lot of problems with the robot like the PID loop is not properly tuned and other minor bugs like that. But this code once polished will be incorporated into the quad for a nice heading hold gyro system. Once again I cannot stress safety enough in dealing with robots. I cut my thumb pretty good on this bot when I stupidly picked it up by the wheels with the heading hold command still active. **Don’t get complacent. You will get hurt.** Luckily I only received a minor cut. Had that been in the quad rotor blades I probably would have been cut down to the bone if not lost the finger entirely. The code still rough so caveat emptor if you use it. I would rather this be a conceptual take away then off the shelf code to just run:

If you're an engineer that does any sort of controls work you know what I'm talking about. I can't put into words how awesome this is. If you're just doing your basic IO stuff it's not worth it. But any sort of PID control, etc writing in C just isn't going to cut it. Simulink IS the industry standard for this sort of stuff. Flight controls (Boeing), automotive (Ford, Chrysler, Toyota) , offroad (Cat, Cummins

Students: If your school has computers with full toolbox kit or you can get cheap licenses it's worth it to put on your resume. [Personally I think Mathworks will understand if you get it through other means so you can put it on your resume. If your employer buys you an extra seat of Embedded Coder I think it's an extra $4-5 by itself.]

It says that it only works on Windows but I have it working on both Lion and Debian it just requires a manual call to make and avrdude to upload it. 

Edit: Some people seem to think this is a way to replace C. It's not. If you're not an engineer or haven't taken controls classes it's really not going to make much sense. You definitely need to be comfortable in the Laplace domain and know digital controls to utilize it fully.

I'm a complete newbie with respect to Arduino. 

I would like to make a coffee capsule dispenser where the payment is made with bitcoins. I'm not worried about vandalism.

The idea I had in mind is the following:

* The mechanism for the dispenser is by using a spiral

* Some kind of motor (servo?) to rotate the spiral.
* Arduino to control the motor.
* Payment is made through bitcoin. I want to use blockchain.info receive payment api: https://blockchain.info/api/api_receive . Whenever a $1 (or more precisely, and will trigger the motor when such a callback is received. If you're not familiar with bitcoin, please ignore the payment part.
* Wrap everything with a nice case. 

Any remarks regarding the design? Is the spiral the easiest way to implement a dispenser? How much time would such a project take for a total newbie? I have programming experience (but not on the Arduino)
Is the Arduino the easiest platform

I would appreciate if you can help me create a list with all the parts needed. If I succeed building the dispenser

A college buddy of mine


The end result is a 1U rack enclosure that contains a beefy power supply, buttons to manually control the fire cannons, a button to arm the manual controls (and disable midi input), buttons to control the sparkers, and various diagnostic LEDs.


The end design for the cannons themselves took my by surprise. These are freaking enormous! They throw heat several yards and when used in concert can produce uncomfortable warmth from several feet. They are designed to follow as many fire codes as we could get our hands on (the guidelines are somewhat cryptic). Each cannon has a pilot torch at its top

I can go two directions with my future development efforts, and Logic Analyzers/Oscopes?

Have I even come close to capturing what makes the Arduino special?

Does this board have any chance of becoming the ""Arduino"" of the FPGA world?

- 12V battery to switching regulator: 60ma / 0.72W

EDIT on the blog: I forgot to mention specifics of using arduino as a programmer. Changes have been updated.

I know it's not really arduino

###Parts:###
======
* [ATtiny85](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9378)  
* [Microchip I2C EEPROM](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/525)  
* Arduino as ISP (programmer)  
* Serial LCD  
* 2x 4.7k resistors  
* Jumper wires  
  
###ATtiny Pinout###
=========
1. Reset  
1. D3  
1. D4  
1. GND  
1. SDA  
1. D1  
1. SCL  
1. Vcc  

###24LC256 Microchip I2C EEPROM Pinout###
========
1. A0  
1. A1  
1. A2  
1. Vss (GND)  
1. SDA  
1. SCL  
1. WP
1. Vcc

###Connections###
========

ATtiny85 pin 8 to +5V (or +3.3V
ATtiny85 pin 4 to GND  
ATtiny85 pin 5 to EEPROM pin 5 (with 4.7k pull-up resistor to +5V)  
ATtiny85 pin 7 to EEPROM pin 6 (with 4.7k pull-up resistor to +5V)  
ATtiny85 pin 2 to Serial LCD  
EEPROM pins 1-4 to GND  
EEPROM pin 7 to GND  
EEPROM pin 8 to +5V  
  
The pull-up resistors are necessary when using the ATtiny85.  They are not necessary on the arduino because the arduino has internal pull-ups enabled when using the I2C interface.  
  
The A0
  
The WP pin on the EEPROM is for write protection.  When this pin is high you cannot write to the EEPROM (though you can still read).  
  
[EEPROM datasheet](http://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/IC/24LC256.pdf)  
  
###Setting Up the Arduino Environment###
=========
I do not have an independent programmer
  
I had originally clicked the wrong board when trying to burn the bootloader.  Selecting the 20MHz external clock option

Continue following the instructions in the beginning of this section.  
  
You will also need the [TinyWireM library](http://arduino.cc/playground/uploads/Code/TinyWireM.zip)
  
**NOTE:** If your Serial lcd has a library that uses SoftwareSerial or you are using SoftwareSerial to connect to your lcd you must burn the 8MHz bootloader.  You will also have to change the values defined in the top of USI_TWI_Master.cpp and USI_TWI_Master.h to account for the different clock rate.  
  
    #define F_CPU 8000000UL // was 1000000UL  
in the .cpp file  
  
    #define SYS_CLK   8000.0 // was 1000.0  
in the .h file  
  
[USIi2c library documentation](http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/USIi2c)  
  
Continue on after you have setup the arduino as a programmer and successfully burnt the bootloader to the ATtiny (test with the blink example
  
**NOTE:** You may get a message ""avrdude: please define PAGEL and BS2 signals in the configuration file for part ATtiny85"".  This can be ignored.  
  
###The sketch###
=======
Most of configuration I got from [this](http://www.hobbytronics.co.uk/arduino-external-eeprom) site.  I tweaked it because it was originally designed for the arduino.
  
    #include &lt;TinyWireM.h&gt; // equivalent of Wire library
    #include &lt;SoftwareSerial.h&gt;  // for serial lcd
    
    #define eeprom        0x50              // address for eeprom
    
    SoftwareSerial lcd(4
    char abcs[] = {'a', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i'
    
    void setup(){
      lcd.begin(9600);  // initialize serial  
      clearlcd();
      TinyWireM.begin(); // initialize I2C lib
      lcd.print(""EEPROM Test 1"");  // test lcd
      delay(1000);
    }
    
    void loop(){
      // cycle through character array
      // address 0
      // repeat and cylce through
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++){
        writeEEPROM(eeprom
        clearlcd();
        lcd.print(""array object: "");
        lcd.print(i);
        lcd.write(0xfe); // These 3 lines
        lcd.write(0x45); // change my lcd
        lcd.write(0x40); // cursor location
        lcd.write(readEEPROM(eeprom
        delay(1000);
      }
    }
    
    void writeEEPROM(int deviceaddress
    {
      int rdata = data;
      TinyWireM.beginTransmission(deviceaddress);
      TinyWireM.send((int)(eeaddress &gt;&gt; 8));
      TinyWireM.send((int)(eeaddress &amp; 0xFF));
      TinyWireM.send(rdata);
      TinyWireM.endTransmission();
    }
    
    byte readEEPROM(int deviceaddress
    {
      byte rdata = 0xFF;
      TinyWireM.beginTransmission(deviceaddress);
      TinyWireM.send((int)(eeaddress &gt;&gt; 8));
      TinyWireM.send((int)(eeaddress &amp; 0xFF));
      TinyWireM.endTransmission();
      TinyWireM.requestFrom(deviceaddress
      if (TinyWireM.available())
      {
        rdata = TinyWireM.receive();
      }
      return rdata;
    }
    
    void clearlcd()
    {
      lcd.write(0xFE);
      lcd.write(0x51);
    }

1328765710.0,phfr6,Arduino-based accelerometer with graphic LCD,,25,4,6,"I just finished making a prototype of an accelerometer with a graphical LCD as the display.  This is version 0.1

The accelerometer has a few screens that display acceleration information.  The first displays X &amp; Y acceleration along with bar meters of each, Y, &amp; Z acceleration along with bar meters of each, the fourth is a graphical display of X &amp; Y acceleration, and the fifth shows maximum and minimum acceleration values for all three axes.  Additionally, the backlight changes color in response to longitudinal acceleration.

Besides the components needed to build a [standalone Arduino](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Standalone)

[ST7565 graphic LCD](http://www.adafruit.com/products/250)

[HEF4050BP non-inverting buffer](http://www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/HEF4050B.pdf) (included w/ purchase of gLCD from Adafruit) for converting 5 V signals to 3.3 V


[ADXL335 3-Axis Accelerometer](http://www.adafruit.com/products/163)

[MCP1702 3.3 V regulator for powering the accelerometer and HEF4050BP](http://search.digikey.com/us/en/products/MCP1702-3302E%2FTO/MCP1702-3302E%2FTO-ND/1098463)

Three 330 Ohm resistors to put in series with the display backlight LEDs and 5 V PWM source

One [tactile switch](http://www.adafruit.com/products/367) for switching between displays

One 120 Ohm resistor to put in series with the tactile switch

[Universal prototype board](http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2103800)

Initial setup of the ST7565 can be found in the [Adafruit tutorial](http://www.ladyada.net/learn/lcd/st7565.html).  For the sake of clarity, so it has 11 pinouts instead of 9 pinouts.  The pinout is as follows:

B-:  Cathode of blue backlight

G-:  Cathode of green backlight

A+:  Common RGB LED anode

R-:  Cathode of red backlight

GND:  Ground

VDD:  +3.3 V

SID:  Serial input data

SCLK:  Serial input clock

A0:  Register select input pin

RST:  Reset

CS:  Chip select
     
     

The ST7565 expects 3.3V at the inputs, a ground, and I/O pins.  The I/O pins are adjacent to each other, so just connect a 5V signal to an input, and you'll see the same signal scaled down to 3.3V on the adjacent output.

Setting up the ADXL335 accelerometer is also pretty straightforward.  I used a 3.3 V regulator to power it, the ADXL335 has six pins:

GND:  Ground

Z:  Z acceleration

Y:  Y acceleration

X:  X acceleration

3V:  +3 V (can accept 1.8-3.6 V)

TST:  Test pin (provides known response on X

    
     
I grounded the test pin to prevent it from floating and causing erroneous readouts on the X

Here is how I had the components connected to the Arduino:

A1:  Z accelerometer pin
A2:  X accelerometer pin
A3:  Y accelerometer pin  (I switched the X &amp; Y pins because I changed the orientation of the ADXL335 when I took it off the breadboard)

2:  Tactile switch
3:  (Will be connected to audio feedback in future rev)
4:  NC
5:  LCD CS
6:  LCD RST
7:  LCD A0
8:  LCD SCK
9:  LCD B-
10:  LCD R-
11:  LCD G-
12:  LCD MOSI

The LCD B-/R-/G- are connected to the Arduino via 330 Ohm resistors.  The tactile switch is connected via a 120 Ohm resistor

That's pretty much it.  The rest of the magic happens in the code, and found this one to be the most useful.

Here are a few notes that may be of help

-You can't display floats with a graphical LCD

-The accelerometer output depends on the input voltage.  The zero point will be half of the input voltage.  The rate of change (in mV/g) is ideally 0.1 times the input voltage (in mV).  So if you're supplying 3.3 V to the accelerometer

-The u8g library can't display a box with negative dimensions relative to the origin of the box.  To display a box that increases in size in the negative direction in proportion to negative acceleration

-The fonts in the library take up a fair amount of memory, make sure you have enough memory available.

Future improvements:

-Currently

-I'm going to include an audio feedback that changes pitch and volume in proportion to acceleration.  This will

-It would be nice to add GPS data logging and write position/acceleration values to an SD card so that you can plot acceleration on a map at a later time.  That will probably require a Mega

-The current zeroing process requires that the accelerometer be level and accelerations are computed assuming that gravity was acting on the Z-axis only while zeroing.  Future revs may include algorithms to eliminate this assumption.",,t5_2qknj,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/phfr6/arduinobased_accelerometer_with_graphic_lcd/

Caveats: 

- all PWM stops when you're in ""power save"" mode.
- hacking this code to use ""idle"" mode instead will work at a cost of about 5ma extra current draw and sleep() finishing about 5x faster than normal.  If anyone is really interested in figuring out what's going on
- sleep() has a granularity of 5ms

The fermentation chamber sits above and cold air is blown into the chamber by two computer case fans.  There is also a fan in each the fermentation chamber and the kegerator to circulate air to ensure an even temperature.


With a considerable amount of help from /r/arduino


Just this morning I wrote a short program to turn on the freezer

I am planning on building a kegerator/fermentation chamber for a homebrewing project([like this one](http://www.wortomatic.com/articles/The-Mother-of-All-Fermentation-Chillers)) and I will need to monitor and control three separate temperature zones.

Zone 1 would be the kegerator zone and controlled by a 120vac relay to a chest freezer.

Zones 2 and 3 would be the fermentation chambers and controlled by PC fans blowing air from the chest freezer.

I would also like to incorporate and LCD panel readout with push buttons to take temperature adjustment input.  Probably going to use [this LCD shield](http://www.robotshop.com/dfrobot-lcd-keypad-shield-arduino.html?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=base&amp;utm_campaign=jos).

tl:dr

Story: 
Several months ago my boss mentioned to the three developers that work in our office (who are also smoking) that they were were doing an ""experiment"".  

It turns out for several weeks they decided to record and monitor when we went out and smoked (we all go at the same time usually) and who initiated it.  The idea was, then make a marketing case study about it.  Fortunately, the boss is ultra cool and **none of this was to bust our balls about smoking**.  

As developers at a company that specializes in making boring data interesting - we of course decided to build a website.  We would click ""I'm smoking"" when we went out

I then came up with the idea to make a physical interface where we would walk past it and punch buttons.  Something that might make it easier to remember to record that data.  Sure enough, I might as well finish(kinda) it!"".  It took me 3 days, but now I have effectively a punch clock that updates a database!

**How it works : **

3 Buttons are Toggles for the LEDs.. Essentially the LEDs light up when you've pushed the button (for each person).. then the arduino sends data to a perl script running on my machine that updates the website.  The website connects to the database and accesses the last punch.  The website also every second runs some javascript to check if the status has changed
