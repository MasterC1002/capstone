Rather than trying to force feed people ""true dubstep"" by posting links all day, I'm going to try to start a series of educational posts about the genre in an effort to give this subreddit a bit of a comeback.

So anyways

Dubstep was an underground genre for nearly a decade before it really became popular in the last two years or so

It all really started with UK Garage, but give it a shot. It's groovy music with some nice bass as well.

* [Karl H &amp; Ed Case - Killer Instinct](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuDAM4uPBvQ)


As you can see

Eventually, most often with the bass playing a bigger role.

* [Monie Love - Slice Of Da Pie (El-B Dub Mix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjd5wu8NCQ)

What was also borrowed from dub reggae were the ideas of dubplate and soundsystem culture. Dubplates (aka dubs) in a broad sense, so DJs (often the producers themselves) can play them out. Unfortunately, in modern times, true dubplates are dying out for the sake of convenience; dubs and dubplates no longer exclusively refers to acetates, they can also just be CDs or even just MP3s.

Dubplates are very exclusive, and therefore they hear the music in the environment for which it was made. Dubplate culture and soundsystem culture go hand in hand.

Eventually (late 90s, El-B, Horsepower Productions, and the like. It was around this time that the signature wobble also started to emerge in some productions.

This darker form of garage really achieved underground success around 2001/2002 at the club FWD&gt;&gt; (Forward). In 2002, it was also known as ""raggage"". In 2003, Skream and Benga started producing exclusive dubs (dubplates) for DJ Hatcha to play out. That same year, Tempa released Dubstep Allstars Vol. 1, mixed by Hatcha. This release really established dubstep as it's own genre, and it featured artists like Skream, Benga, Horsepower Productions

Feel free to ask questions

The whole virtual stage artwork was revamped recently and I have a feeling it was to support events like this. It seemed pretty popular

I was one of the early listeners in the room and managed to start recording about 20ish minutes before Knife Party went up. The whole set is over 4+ hrs long!

Also glad I found an excuse to use KimDotCom's new Mega service.

&gt; ""Look
&gt; There's an underlying issue with all of this- I didn't mean to rip you off nor did i mean to offend you in any way. I don't know what you use for making your music but I bassically was DJing that night and for the first 20 minutes I was toying with some of your stuff... I hardly ever DJ... it was actually my FIRST time... and I did not realize that the track that came out was only the right side with all of the universal effects and loops overtop of it. I am re-exporting it as a total track- i just never listened to it until I saw the massive amounts of listens and comments.... and i was really intrigued and then realized what had happened. I am very sorry... if you don't mind I will soon post the entire 2 hour mix (and I already had you tagged in the info) but the first 20 or so I was toying with this and some of my more progressive music and when i exported the recording I didn't bother to listen to it. I really SINCERELY apologize and I don't know how else to say it.
&gt;
&gt;I am sorry. Didn't mean to do that to you- but let me know if its okay to release the mix I made that has your music in it... if not then so be it. I understand. I was just trying to do something different that night and was ultimately careless about what i was doing on soundcloud.""

My reply:

&gt; ""I'm not offended, but not so much with people &gt; using my MIXES as their mixes.  
&gt; I would think that would be common sense.
&gt; It also seems strange to me that this would be your first time djing when you have fliers with your name on them from over a year ago on your facebook. but I'll ignore that.
&gt;You can put up the whole mix if you want

Edit4: SC msgs.

Message 1

&gt; No... I am not a DJ usually... I've been playing live electronic music for a long long time... this was a small party for some good people and i was trying something new... usually I have a drummer and I play the keys- this time I was using serato, 2 turntables and an akai apc40.

&gt;I actually just got a call about the sound I gave to them for the video doesn't match up with the sound on the video.

&gt;I only played with your stuff for about 20 minutes total and i had 2 separate 'tracks' running in ableton and swapped back and forth between them being synced and was adding beats and some synth samples on top.

&gt;i am not in the business of stealing anyones music- and I also already had your name in the info for the track.. i sincerely apologize.

&gt;i only played for about an hour that night but paper diamond and michael menert played with me for a while and we just sampled overtop of eachother.

&gt;the entire mix is maybe an hour of me playing(obviously with some of your material) and then those guys come in linked through my computer and it's been more hassle than anything.

&gt;i can't say that I am sorry enough- and I hope my reputation hasn't been damaged too much by this. listen to some of my other tracks and you'll see that every single time i play someone else's music I note them in the title... and most of my music is original stuff.

&gt;the 2 hour mix will be up soon- and i'll share it with you directly before anyone else and you can tell me if its cool.

&gt;alright? again

&gt;full video and track will be up soon. and if its possible for you- i'd like to have you out to play one of the shows i am doing this summer... i can offer plane ticket

&gt;again i am sorry. can't say it enough... im honestly embarrassed so much its killing me.

&gt;hope all is well- i'll show you the track before it's up.

Message 2

&gt;So I just heard through the grape vine that you've been tearing me up on a blog? I do not DJ. before my birthday I had never spun a record in my life. This was an honest mistake and you can post everything I say but don't be selective. Clear it up so I don't have MY network falling apart. That isn't fair. And if it makes you feel any better- you're ruining the reputation of a guy who has a physically disabling auto immune disease called Lupus. Don't know if you've heard of it- but it's hard for me to walk or even write with a pen. I am not some kind of asshole loser trying to steal your precious remixes. I am just a guy who was a fan but now that I've read what you've said I'm pretty turned off by your attitude. I am who I am. I make mistakes like everyone else. I didn't mean to 'steal' anything from you. But I feel like I am being attacked and ultimately persecuted with only one side of the story- before I even had a chance to redeem myself.

&gt;I like your music- its revolutionary in a lot of ways... and i dont know if its yours or if you just DJ... but I use a keyboard

&gt;In all due respect

&gt;If you're a truly good guy and good man

&gt;I hope all is well.

&gt;-J

My reply

&gt;I wouldn't really say I've been 'tearing' you up really. I just posted the situation as I saw it because frankly
I've spent a lot of time, I would be lying if I said I wasn't a little bit put off by someone playing out parts (or all) of it as their live set.
I hope you can see why. Even if you're adding stuff
I appreciate you putting my name in the tracklist
I don't have any problem whatsoever with you using my music or remixes in your sets

&gt;That said

&gt;I've really not gone out of my way to attack you.
I've shared what seemed to be a pretty ridiculous situation of some of my work getting ripped off
I had read through some of the comments on the track on soundclud. There were people complimenting the mix and you accepting the credit.
I'm still not sure which part was an accident. That you didn't know you shouldn't use someone elses dj mix as your own? That seems like it should be common sense even to non djs.
&gt;For what it's worth
&gt;I'm not trying to hold a grudge
I'm sure it will blow over in a couple days. Take it as a valuable lesson.

&gt;peace
&gt;rook

Edit4: My buddy just linked me some videos. He claims that it was his first time djing.  Vids deleted by him.

Some comedy going on in his replies to this.

&gt;and honestly... you're really going to tear me apart for a mistake I owned up to like this... as a DJ who just plays other peoples music? listen to my tracks on soundcloud...

&gt;http://www.soundcloud.com/ancient-intelligence

&gt;they're either ORIGINALS or recognized REMIXES that are duly NOTED as your name was. You're starting fires that are ultimately unnecessary and unprofessional. I refuse to fire back because I did make the mistake that caused it- but be a bigger man and don't use my name to promote your own shit shamelessly with as much shame as can be.

&gt; i dont know what he produces because i haven't seen it.

&gt;chill? he's bashed me publicly. its SLANDER! He posted 1/4 of the story... thats it... so go ahead and think that this is fair and balanced and all of that... but it's really one sided and its turned around to bite him in the ass instead of me. And I have no publicity because my name is not on anything. I don't care about who you guys are or what you do. All I know is that I am in a niche market on the other side of the continent from you and I admitted an HONEST MISTAKE and I've still been hounded for it.

These two artists have redefined my preferences on dubstep. Although I never was a fan of the Skrillex style of hard punching, I cannot even listen to a few seconds of any related artists without a massive yearning to listen to Minnesota to calm my dubstep soul. 

I had listened to Minnesota and Magnetic Man before, and California Dreaming by Minnesota and a few other of his remixes, but after the newest Altered States EP by Minnesota i decided to download his entire discography and am unequivocally blown away by every single damn song.

Why does this matter? Because this subreddit is quickly moving away from what it once represented.


So what is dubstep? Dubstep is a mix of 2-step and garage


Here are some popular examples of Dubstep

[Skream - Midnight Request Line](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6pTSGvp7T8)


[Rusko - Cockney Thug](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riv8gXlf2xk)


[UltraBlack - Bear Trap (Excision Remix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HlwYIo020) (my personal favorite)


[Rob Sparx &amp; John Maveric - Windscreen Snipa (Propa Tingz Remix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSEOt1mMA6o)

As you can tell, half time feel, and heavy basslines.


So what differs this from stuff like Skrillex/Feed Me? Simple. It gets put under **Electro**. It's at a constant 130 bpm with full-time drums (meaning snares on the 2/4 (1 **2** 3 **4** is the count)



Examples of electro

[Skrillex - Kill Everybody](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F21aifX0lZY)

[Vaski - Lost My Mind Electro VIP](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qzPnlQjBJ4) (it's even in the name here)

[Bloody Beetroots  - Warp 1.9 (GTronic remix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGKPIjK9UVA) (badass bassline!)


Now I anticipate some of your responses

**Q:Why do you care?**

A: I love dubstep, that's not exactly inspiring


**Q: But these artists are good! Are you saying that we have to listen to the artists you like?**

A: No no, [r/futurebeats](http://www.reddit.com/r/futurebeats), [r/electro](http://www.reddit.com/r/electro) and even [r/electronicmusic](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronicmusic/) where you can post whatever you want.


To me


I'm expecting a lot of flames and downvotes

edit2: thanks to http://www.reddit.com/r/realdubstep/comments/l7dwb/saw_this_on_hulu_last_night_the_widdler_is_now/ this post is how i found out about it

edit3:  Thanks sooooooooo much everyone. Great tips, more music to come in the future (hopefully with less muscley rubbing videos)

I am not really looking to sue them

final edit: i am becoming an editor... hiyo.... ok really though

thanks for listening everyone



**LAST EDIT: Talking with my label owner at Dubstep Records and with SWELLNY. The short version is there was a misunderstanding (both on my part for what the song would be used for and on their part for reasons I shouldn't post) and I am being paid for the royalties. Thanks for all words. I didn't expect you guys to rampage their youtube video like that o.o **

&gt; Most of the ""purists"" just like calling it brostep to demean the style of music not to actually create a way of defining subgenres of dubstep.

I think he's exactly right. And personally

*Most* people still have no idea what dubstep is. To those people

It's kind of interesting, I Have Dreams, Pg.99, Circle Takes The Square, Texas Is The Reason, Fugazi, etc. etc.), because the latter was much louder and more aggressive than it's predecessors.

Of course, underOATH, etc.) *wasn't* by definition actually emo, rather than trying to redefine and subcategorize our own music.

Dubstep is unique in the fact that it is a *very* defined electronic subgenre with lots of ""rules"" that producers adhere to. What other type of dance music can boast the fact that 95% of their songs are written at the same tempo, Doctor P... ""B-B-B-B-B-Badman sound..."").

I think the lesson to be learned here is that we are already fans and followers of a pretty small subgenre of dance music. Most people, four-to-the-floor-type house music of sorts. We're so different from that! What with our swingy polyrhythms and syncopation, half-time breakdown-like sound, and killer sub. Who gives a fuck if there's more distortion on a particular artist's bass synth, or a song goes double time for five seconds?

**TL;DR It's all dubstep

**AND**

If you're totally not sure and it is bass and beat related then a post to [Future Beats](/r/futurebeats) or [Future Funk Airlines](/r/futurefunkairlines) is what you should do.

**Subscribe and submit to these sub-reddits

This concept isn't fucking hard and saves people making tiny communities that burn out as quick as you can say DerpStep. Yeah

This community could (and used to) be really tight. Without sounding a prick, it's got no family in Dubstep.

The only mods that ever gave a shit were [lukemcr](/user/lukemcr), but are also unwilling to learn anything either.

It's not hard to be subbed to multiple reddits and submit the correct content to each one

For the people that call me a hipster/purist etc, but I like some Brostep also (I played some in my set last Friday FFS and I play Darkstep/Neurofunk which is way more filthy than Dubstep will ever be), it's not the liking of Brostep and other genres NOT related to Dubstep that angers me, it's people's ignorance, it's peoples unwillingness to concede in the face of facts and clear lineage and history, it's people who think that people like me should STFU and just ""like it"". I come here for Dubstep, not your latest hard-on for Skrillex or the Wobble in a DnB Jump Up track.

So if you people want this place to be better

**OR**

The mods need to start giving a shit

I'll look forward to the insta-down-votes and no responses

Did this for /r/Monstercat a while ago and had a blast with it. Ended up at [~2 hours long](https://soundcloud.com/michaelhill-2/cat-eats-mau5-mix) and pretty well received.

So

Just a heads up: I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PUT IT ALL IN. Sometimes a song just doesn't fit anywhere/the BPM is fucked up. For example, don't get mad if your song doesn't end up in there.

So, ~75% of the UKF *cough*

**EDIT** I have work in a few hours, for the love of god, from here on out try and keep it dubstep/drumstep. This means either 140ish BPM or 170ish BPM. If you don't know what that means, if it sounds like the same tempo as Ghosts n Stuff, it's 128. So, if it sounds like the same speed as [this,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZCN-TP5icE) that's 140 BPM and I will definitely be able to get it in. If it sounds like a speed like [this, looking at how this is getting a bigger and bigger drumstep section by the second. If it sounds like the speed of [this, 'cuz this shit is sounding crazy.

**Update as of 10:16 Central Time, but I'll fill everyone in on when I think I'll have it done tonight while I do more sorting.

**Update at 11:42 Central Time, (As in, a bunch of stuff that sounds like Knife Party) AVOID ANYTHING THAT SOUNDS LIKE HOUSE WITH 128 BPM.** I may not be able to get it in and you'll just be disappointed in the end, which is the last thing I want. I'll try, but I really don't wanna disappoint any of you. I'm gonna work on this until 1 AM tonight. If your suggestion's in for sure, I'll tell you ""In"" and add it to the list. If it's probably not, I will inform you why. So

**Update at 1:30am, it's not crazy good. I was half asleep when I did this, sitting in my chair, responding to people on here, on the fly, and some of these songs I've only listen to one time before dropping them in here. But, just to keep you guys entertained, I'll do some more work.

**Update at 8:41 am, I'm gonna get back on this. I'm gonna download anything that I missed and then work on some more of the mix. Awaaayyyy...

**Update at 9:53 AM, I'm happy with the suggestions you guys gave. Most of 'em I can use and I plan on using.

**Update at 3:54 PM

**Update at 2:19 PM

**Update at 5:41 PM

**Update at 12:22 PM, so I'm trying to get in theirs as well. I not only want every song in there, but I also want it to actually sound good. If I wanted to, I could get this over with and just throw everything in there right now, mix everything without planning or listening to the music you guys gave me, and say HERE YA GO IZ GOOOOOOOOOD. that's no fun. So, I'm working hard on it. If you wanna know exactly where I'm at, the first wubs/wobbles/classic dubstep part, 18 in the first section of the classic dubstep,

You'd think this would be simple... but here are the details.

1. THIS MUST BE AN ORIGINAL WORK UNLESS YOU PERSONALLY KNOW THE PERSON YOU ARE REMIXING AND HAVE THEIR PERMISSION.

2 . It has to be dubstep. That means 140bpm. Half time snare

If you are confused about this point

   3 That's it! Go make some tunes!


on 5/19 i will make a post on here detailing where you should send your songs. Just as a heads up

That's seriously the equivalent of avoiding people simply because you don't like their hat. 

Not that anyone gives a shit about [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette) anymore

&gt; The down arrow is for comments that add little or nothing to the discussion.

The world is going to be filled with things you don't like and music you don't want to hear. This is ok

When was the last time you were convinced by ""your music is stupid and you should listen to ___ instead""? Now compare that to nicely introducing someone to an artist you think they may enjoy. Think of it as quietly manipulating people by pretending to be nice if you want to. 

I'm considering bringing up the topic of removing downvotes again

t**l;dr**: plz don't downvote submissions just because you don't like them. It's not helping anyone and you should consider what kind of person that makes you. 

Downvotes should solely be for burying spiteful or irrelevant content. Their availability should not dictate their usage.  ",self,t5_2qi8s,False,,vinyl,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/dubstep/comments/tywi9/regarding_downvotes_and_not_being_an_asshat/

- Skrillex is an electronic music producer. He makes house tunes, the almighty Skream makes non-dubstep tracks, too.

- He's not a typical 'DJ'. He uses an M-Audio TriggerFinger to trigger, and EQ clips in Ableton Live.

- 'OMGZ HE DUZNT BEATMATCH? LOLOLOL'. Right. Just like every single other laptop DJ doesn't beatmatch anymore because it's all controlled by software nowadays. That doesn't mean there's no skill involved in properly cueing and dropping tracks.

- He's unquestionably one of the best producers currently making popular electronic music. Anyone with even a little bit of production knowledge can appreciate the detail put into his productions. It's said that he spends months at a time on individual tracks before releasing. If he wasn't a respected producer

- 'Yeah but what a fag

- Lastly, please realize that you're doing a disservice to the genre in general. I'm not a bro, chances are you're not a bro, and I would think we've advanced enough as a culture to stop defining and redefining musical subgenres based on a particular demographic who enjoys it. Please realize that genres grow and evolve with time, and the days when dubstep was only played at Fabric by Benga and Skream and Coki are gone. Dubstep is already a subgenre of electronic music and we'll be no better than the fucking metalheads and hardcore kids who have come up with a hundred stupid goddamn definitions and scenes for themselves and fragmented the genre into near-obscurity.

TL;DR: This is a 2010 dubstep playlist in which none of the tracks contain the headache inducing WOBWOBWOB fart storm that is known as mainstream dubstep or better known as ""brostep"".

I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who has contributed to this sub. Without you we wouldn't be what we are today. Dubstep has taken the world by storm and this graph just proves the facts. Even today we still get posts about new people just finding dubstep and coming here to further their journey into the sound. I remember only a year and a half ago we were only at around 200 readers. It has been really amazing to see this group grow and evolve and we will most likely break 10k readers this year.

THANK YOU everyone on behalf of me and the rest of the Mod's. 2011 looks to be a huge year for Dubstep and /r/Dubtep. :D

Vex'd:

I guess Lion VIP got taken down from youtube. If you can find it

[Vex'd - Fallen (Remix of Distance song)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njleDMwLsvo&amp;feature=related)

[Vex'd - Disposition (Ft. Jest)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hG0w7R59FY)

[Vex'd - Angels](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul5FXfD9cEg)

I really think Vex'd have a unique sound that combines a more industrial urban sound with DnB influences

DMZ/Mala/Coki/Loefah/&amp;crew:

[DMZ- Antiwar Dub](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pBCA9mUciU) (essential for everyone into this genre)

[Mala- Changes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ky5Mt2PLf9E)

[Mala- Alicia](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpzzGXBW4GA)

[Coki- Goblin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cWgvo6TtZQ)

[Coki- Red Eye](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCm1BEgQTW8&amp;feature=related)

[Loefah- Horror Show](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMghwdG6SOE)

[Loefah- the Goat Stare](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1Ed9deW39A)

DMZ are big. Mala and Coki release under the name DMZ along with their own solo stuff. Mala's stuff is more subdued while Coki has more sick wobbles. Loefah's tunes are usually more minimal but show what you can do with just pure drums and bass and a sample.



Burial:

[Burial- Archangel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlEkvbRmfrA)

[Burial- Shell of Light](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS2wE7BZel0&amp;feature=related)

[Burial- U Hurt Me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AN-PxS-LAk)

[Burial- Versus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrScojjEgg)

Honestly I could write on and on about Burial. Same for a lot of these artists, but I disagree with the last point. His first LP (last two songs I selected) and his second LP (first two songs) are really different sides from the same artist imo. 


I pretty much tried to pick my favorite tunes from the people I felt like are the biggest producers everyone should know aside from Skream and Benga. Some of the people in the picture are DJs (MAH) who helped get dubstep more attention as an artistic movement. Some are DJs (N-Type, and Caspa. Hatcha afaik really mentored Skream and Benga and did a lot to get them attention and N-Type really helped push the wobble heavy dubstep.

Hopefully people who know more about other producers can contribute as well. I could post Distance and Pinch songs but I'm not so familiar with a lot of their output and history like some others are.",self,t5_2qi8s,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/dubstep/comments/knlnu/since_a_lot_of_people_said_they_didnt_know_many/

This is why I'd really like to hear some thoughts from you guys. Here's a few questions to jump-start the brain juices and strengthen what I'm trying to say:

1. Is dubstep dead
2. What direction can you see the genre going toward? Reggae? Trap? Blues? 
3. Who do you see as being the current innovators? I'm not talking about who sells the most records or tickets. I'm talking about progress

**Now before I start



Ok



The first thing I'm going to do is give you a written example of a half step beat and a DnB beat


**Half Step Beat**

1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and

K____________S_________


**DnB Beat**

1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and

K_______S____________K_________S___



**Drum and Bass**

* Usually between 160 BPM and 180 BPM (Mainly in the 170's)
* Inspired by Jungle and takes the breakbeat idea from it

 
Examples of DnB tracks:

* [Sub Focus - Let The Story Begin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faZJNnKeug8) (Your typical DnB track)
* [Noisia - Cold Veins](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3dIevIciKg) (Classic Noisia track with the Jungle breakbeat influence in it)
* [Seba &amp; Paradox Feat. Kirsty Hawkshaw - The Light](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFz-SqEo9O8) (Liquid DnB track with the Jungle breakbeat influence in it)



**Drumstep**

* Usually between 160 BPM and 180 BPM (Mainly in 160's and 170's)
* Inspired by the half step beat in Dubstep (Hence the step in Drumstep)


Examples of Drumstep tracks:

* [Rusko - Everyday (Netsky Remix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FZihLJc0WU) (Pay attention to the drums)
* [Crissy Criss &amp; Youngman - Kick Snare VIP (Drumstep Mix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPP3LmXku4c) 



Now that you see the difference between Drumstep and DnB



**Dubstep**

* Usually between 130 BPM and 150 BPM (Usually 140 or 145)
* Half step beat 


Examples of Dubstep tracks:

* [Magnetic Man - Karma Crazy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6c7BwBwdRk) (Perfectly suits Reddit)
* [Chasing Shadows - The End](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI-31wqqLr8) (Side note: Chasing Shadows is like the Dubstep form of Neurofunk)
* [Distance - Weigh Down](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRHy_bf1EmY) (Off one of the best albums ever)



Examples of Drumstep tracks that people confuse with Dubstep:

* [Nero - Departure](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUvlOAIXeOs)
* [Bassnectar - Boombox (Datsik Remix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7vChXb0lK0)


Incase you're still wondering what's the difference



I kind of rushed this whole thing but it should be pretty clear. If anyone else has things to add or can explain better
