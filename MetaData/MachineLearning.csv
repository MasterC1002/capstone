Bishop's ""Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning"" is a very hard read. In my opinion, I gave up.

""The Elements of Statistical Learning"" (Hastie et al.) suffers from the same problems. Moreover, but that's a lie. Bishop even tries to teach you basic probability, suggesting that his book can be read by one who doesn't know probability, which is absurd.

The lessons by Andrew Ng are easy to follow but they're not very deep. They show you a collection of techniques but they don't provide the theory that should guide you in using these techniques. Also
The lectures by Tom Mitchell are also very easy to follow but I think he oversimplifies things. By the way

The same material can be presented at very different levels and I found out that there is a noticeable gap between elementary texts and lessons

Finally, Stork, 2ed.). The book doesn't shy away from advanced material and the explanations are great. Finally, a book that I can study on my own without having to rely on somebody else for additional explanations!

Unfortunately

You can read my [project report](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/700763/229a_project.pdf) for more details about the exact implementation. Although it lacks any real figures because of the class-imposed 5 page limit, you can see the code that I wrote for this project on [github](https://github.com/smoreinis/classificator), which also contains a data directory with a script to scrape new posts from Reddit (inspired by the same post from Nick Johnson) and some sample data for people to play around with.

Code Miscellany: This code was written in python, simplejson, Stemmer, sklearn packages (and in fact was based on an sklearn tutorial on classifying newsgroup articles). The extract.py file handles the conversion of a JSON file full of posts into a feature dictionary, while models.py handles the actual supervised classification models provided by sklearn (as well as using CV grid search to find optimal parameters, and the CombinedClassifier which provides overall score posts). The gold.py file runs the whole thing - give it json files as arguments, and it should spit out the results for each type of sklearn classifier, overall F1-score, change default value of combine to True on line 153 in models.py

I hope this can be of use to some of you - it seems there are several people trying to build recommendation systems for posts, or some personalized ranking) could also yield some interesting results and potentially make the model's results even better.

* Do you regret the time taken to get your PHD?
* Are you happy with your salary?

In our first assignment we were supposed to use RWeka and DMwR libraries but even after seeing the solution I still don't understand the code and syntax.

For our project we are to be pre-processing lots of text (which I could easily do in python) and then do ML on it to improve the classification rate. Since it is imbalanced data (10-90) I know I need to deal with stuff such as the area under the curve (which I can't do in Weka).

If this goes well I might write a paper about it (though I have no idea where I would submit it).

Here is the basic premise of the problem: 

**Lots of young girls are used as sex slaves/prostitutes in the US. If we examine the ad space of young prostitutes can we help them?**

More details:

Their pimps advertise the girls in many cities all across the country. The pimps might have girls in several cities or move girls between several cities. 

These ads appear online in a variety of publications. These ads often come with telephone numbers and photographs.

The question:

If we scrapped ads from these websites what sort of useful analysis could we do?

So far this is what I have thought of:

Do cluster analysis on the text of the ads to see which ads were posted by the same person. Essentially this is an unsupervised learning algorthm being applied to the data of the ads (photo, location, phone number). It was suggested that I use an [LDE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation).  Additionally, there is no need to actually decode the meaning of the ads at this time, but it could be interesting later.

Photo analysis to see which girls are operating in which cities. This has several different possible levels of success: Finding the same picture attached to different ads. Finding similar pictures

What help I would like from r/machinelearning:

How have problems like this been solved in the past. I imagine someone has done analysis on craigslist ads to similar effect, but I wouldn't mind the help.

* Read a bunch of online material to get an overview of data mining.

* Read several chapters from [*Data Mining* by Witten and Frank](http://www.amazon.com/Data-Mining-Practical-Techniques-Management/dp/0120884070/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1305991819&amp;sr=1-2).

* Played with WEKA

* Worked a bit with MS SQL Server and Excel PowerPivot.

* Installed Excel's Data Mining plugin.

There's a *lot* of data for the project, and has several years' worth of readings from several dozen sensors. I think it's supposed to be tied to events (engine turns on, turns off, overheats, fails, etc.) but that column is blank.

Recently

&gt;Me: I have all the software installed and more-or-less know how to use it. So...what am I supposed to be *doing*?

&gt;Boss: Oh

&gt;Me: Well

&gt;Boss: No

&gt;Me: I mean, ""The temperature and pressure have a strong positive correlation"", but--

&gt;Boss: No

&gt;Me: Oh, okay.

For reference

1/1/01 3:23| 3          | 1 | 0=off; 1=on


And here are my problems:

* I have a number of issues with actually manipulating the data into a useful form. I can figure it out eventually

* I feel like I'm obsessing over stuff like my ARFF files just because I'm not actually sure what I'm going to do with them once they've actually been loaded into WEKA. It's also a much easier problem to solve

* My boss told me to read up on Naive Bayesian classifiers, as far as I know, I have no classes in which to put stuff (if I had the EventIDs, I'd imagine it'd be massively useful to be able to classify things into events...) I'm actually a bit unsure about what I *could* do...I guess I could make a model to predict the reading of one sensor based on the readings of the other--but when would that be useful? If you can get all but one reading, odds are you can get the last one too. I guess I could also try to predict stuff based on the previous readings (which would probably be useful, actually)...but without knowing if the engine is on or off or whatever, I'm guessing it wouldn't be as accurate as one would hope.

* Ooh, right? Is this a good idea?

So I'm unclear about what my objective is

In case it's useful--I *do* know how to program (in Python, I took AP Statistics (which so far has not been remotely useful, unfortunately). I'm just quite clearly in very new territory (and don't get me wrong--I'm really happy to be learning new things. It's just pretty uncomfortable, too.)

So I'm sorry if this has been kinda long and unfocused. I'm just overwhelmed and am hoping that you guys will have some words of wisdom.

Thanks in advance.


---------------

TL; DR - I have a stack of data that I'm supposed to get information from. The data is readings from sensors on a large engine (and thus has the pressure, but that's just me--I could be wrong. Rather than blindly running promising-looking algorithms and seeing what happens, I'd like suggestions on what I should be looking for. I'd rather have an objective and then select a method based on it than do it the other way around.",,False,self,t5_2r3gv,,http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/hgqdv/i_have_a_short_internship_doing_data_miningand_am/

Another approach might be to define distance between two trajectories as the sum over time points of the euclidean distances in the 50dim space and then cluster the similarity matrix. Would this be better - I don't have a good intuition for how it would differ from the full 500 feature vector? Are there any better techniques or approaches?

I am asking because I am wondering if using bayesian networks is worth it in my situation:

I have 2000 samples each with a 1000 discrete features that I want to use to predict 1 continuous variable. The hope is that I could build up a bayesian network that would characterize a small portion of my 1000 features as important and to identify logic gates between the important features. 

I thought about doing this as an alternative to doing regressions

What I am not sure of is: 

(1) do people currently learn the networks using MCMC or GA or is there something better?

(2) what are the usual criticisms of Bayes Nets?

(3) I think I should test the significance of the bayes net using the likelihood ratio test with the naive bayes as the null hypothesis

thanks in advance for any feedback.

I'm wondering what an entry level job for an ML career would look like. Embarrassingly, but I don't have the intuition behind the math (also, I believe it's hard to fail out of Master's programs in general because they are cash cows for Universities, and hence there is a general reluctance to punish people that are reasonably smart and paying a lot of money). And so I just don't have the confidence to tackle the Amazon/IBM type jobs that I often see. I've done some courses on Coursera (ML with Andrew Ng, which was awesome, and PGM, which is a total beast), but I would really like an entry level job in ML. However

I would like to hear some opinions here from someone with an experience in both Scala (or other functional/object oriented programming language) and R/Octave.

I imagine that there's a whole world of specialized kernels for special problems but for I don't see the point of SVM for typical generic supervised learning problems.

1) I had thousands of features.  I used the max squares stat used to select the variable at each node to show me which features BRT had deemed important.  Then I took just the top ones (e.g. 20 to 50 of features) and retrained getting almost the same test set ROC.  In fact

We’re a couple of machine learning enthusiasts who have been working for a few years on a MATLAB toolbox to help in our research and projects.  We finally put the effort in to make the toolbox more than a hobby (maybe somewhat respectable even)

The toolbox is currently in a free Beta, and available [here](http://www.newfolderconsulting.com/prt).
Just sign up for a free account (we promise to never sell your e-mail address
You can get a sense for how the toolbox works by checking out [the quick start guide](http://www.newfolderconsulting.com/prtdoc/prtDocQuickStart.html).

We’ve decided that the toolbox will always be free for academic/educational use (we’re still deciding what to do for commercial use).
Although you do need MATLAB (later than 2009A) to use the toolbox, optimization) are required.

**What I think I know:**

Most real data is sparse and that compressive sensing randomly samples your input with some (learnt?) bases to compress them to give an error bound that is extremely small.


**What I dont know but want to know:**

* If the bases are learnt

* How are the bases that are learnt in compressive sensing different from ones learnt from autoencoders (with sparsity enforced)? How are they different from kmeans centroids?

* If you can

* Are there any applications apart from reconstructing noisy data

First of all I clarify some points. We have two similarity matrices which contain same set of items for which we gather information from two different sources.

You can assume that similarity matrices contain pairwise closeness of two people. These closeness values come from two different sources such as Facebook and MySpace.

Let's give you an example to illustrate what I want to say.

We have 4 people: John, Ringo. All they have Facebook and MySpace accounts.

From their Facebook profiles

* Paul - John = 0.5
* Paul - George = 0.4
* Paul - Ringo = 0.6
* John - George = 0.6
* John - Ringo = 0.5
* George - Ringo = 0.6

From MySpace

* Paul - John = 0.2
* Paul - George = 0.3
* Paul - Ringo = 0.4
* John - George = 0.2
* John - Ringo = 0.1
* George - Ringo = 0.15

From informations above

1- What if I align all those values (of course only one triangular for each matrix) in one row (like below) and simply evaluate Pearson Correlation Coefficient between
these rows?

* facebook = [0.5, 0.6, 0.5, 0.6]
* myspace  = [0.2, 0.2, 0.1, 0.15]

You may have noticed that these similarities are **not independent** of each other. So
According to an article named Mandel Test on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantel_test) this simple procedure is not appropriate.

&gt;Because distances are not independent of each other – since changing the ""position"" of one object would change n − 1 of these distances (the distance from that object to each of the others) – we can't assess the relationship between the two matrices by simply evaluating the correlation coefficient between the two sets of distances and testing its statistical significance. The Mantel test deals with this problem.

2- How about the rank correlation techniques such as Kendall?

3- Is there more specific or proper technique to evaluate this? 

4- Mantel Test calculates correlation between two matrices. It seems it is proper for our purpose. I will read [Spatial Analysis in Ecology - Mantel's Test](http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/scicomp/Dloads/SpatialAnalysisEcologists/SpatialEcologyMantelTest.pdf) which can be reached by Wikipedia but could anyone who use this method for same reason share his/her experience?",self,t5_2r3gv,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/r6i99/proper_method_for_calculating_similarity_between/

More detail: I'm particularly struggling with harmonic signals that have close frequencies. As input I have two signals with very little noise that are far apart (w1 and w2 frequencies).

Edit: Here is my [output](http://i.imgur.com/vHwrVU8h.png) which suggests two very close frequencies at either 0.2 and 0.8 hertz/sample is more likely than two signals at 0.2 and 0.8 hertz/sample respectively.

Hi r/machineLearning!


So, but I needed to survey the landscape first. 


I want to really dive into _un_supervised learning. This has a two fold advantage for me, and two, I believe I will be able to use it in my line of work which is very signal-processing intensive. 


So, and those more experienced than me, for an ""executive summary"" or list, of unsupervised learning algorithms. 


(If you like


From the list


(I have already taken Andrew Ngs class on coursera). 


So far my list includes: 

1) K-Means

2) ICA


Thanks in advance!!

Interested in implementing applications from fraud detection to margin improvements through better clustering regardless of industry. Fascinated by the power of data. Can't imagine himself spending the rest of his or her life being a cog in the machine.


The startup:

The core idea it to build platforms and systems around the progressively larger datasets held by various sized companies, 2) datasets 3) extensive practical in certain industry segments, namely web-scale companies and tier 1 retailers.

This project is in the very early planning stages. I'm looking forward to discuss the form it could take with like-minded individuals but with complementary skills sets

Want more specifics ideas? I have plenty of these

Ultimately the goal is to crystallize on a specific concept


My philosophy on startups:

Startups built in one’s free time often fail because they drag on

The core idea for this project is based on lean, limits the dreaded paralyzing fear of failure, and more importantly, keep the time from inception to first client/funding to a minimum.

One such that in most supervised learning approaches you'd be more concerned with minimizing bias rather than variance.

However in this problem the relatively low dimensionality is somewhat deceptive because the variables have very complex high dimensional interactions. I'll give you an example of what I'm talking about:

Suppose you were looking at randomly sampled points in chess games between evenly matches players. The data you had was which pieces each player had lost and you wanted to predict whether the game would ultimately end up in win/lose/draw.

Your feature space in this case is 30 0/1 variables: 8 pawns, 2 bishops, 1 queen, (no king because if he's missing the game's over) multiplied by 2 sides. Assume that you have access to hundreds of millions of independent data points (you can always run AI-AI games and sample new positions).

The idiosyncrasies of the interactions here runs far deeper than standard linear/quadratic variable interactions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Early game when a lot of material's on the board knights tend to be better than bishops. When there's not much material bishops tend to be better.

* If a player is missing a few pawns from ranks far away from each other that's not as bad as a cluster of pawns missing which opens up a hole in his defense.

* At the end of the game if the other side has two bishops

* A queen is about equal to two rooks early game

* The difference of one side having 1 pawn and the other side having no pawns is far more than the difference between having 7 pawns and 8 pawns (because of the chance to convert the pawn to another piece).

As you can see there are endless variations of how the variables can interact. Many of the interactions go along an early/late game dimension. I.e. fewer material more material interactions

This makes it very challenging because it's almost like you need a combined supervised-unsupervised learning process that can discover interesting projections of the variables to interact on (i.e. discover the early/late game metric and start interacting other variables on it). Then plug those into a supervised method. This brings me to the various approaches that I'm considering:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Boosted trees: The problem is the underlying weak learners don't have any chance to capture any of the interesting structure in the feature space. For trees to work they need to have many nodes to discover the complex interactions

* Random forests: This has a better chance of working. But I would have to use very deep trees to capture the interaction

* SVMs: This seems somewhat appealing. I'm not too experienced with SVMs

* Logistic regression: This one I have to throw out right away because the problem is so non-linear

* Neural nets: I'm always somewhat skeptical of these, with ANNs over fitting is always a problem IMO. Maybe bagging many-layered ANNs here might be a good approach, but I've never heard of anyone doing this so I'm not sure if there are good arguments not to.

* Manifold learning: This is the most ""far out"" approach

Anyway this problem has me tied up in knots. So any interesting approaches or good advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

I have 30 observations in 2 classes (15 in each). Each observation has several thousand variables (this could be reduced in a somewhat hand-wavy way, removing one from each class, for tests with fewer iterations) to test the feature selection algorithm, but I'm having real trouble finding a feature selection algorithm which is at all stable across the different iterations of the LOOCV. 

At first I tried ranking features in terms of their contrast-to-noise ratio and building a classifier by using the top one, and finding the optimal classifier out of those, but it meant that a lot of redundant information was included (possibly weighting the classifier in an unhelpful manner), and the results were poor, as well as the choice of features being very unstable- I think because small variations in CNR cause quite large changes in CNR rank. Then I tried greedy forward selection, which was better (80% sensitivity, 87% specificity), so it was a sort of (LOO^2). It would be interesting to use the probability of any feature being selected to weight the final classifier

At the moment I'm trying to reduce the number of features by combining covarying variables, and so I'd need to heuristically reduce the number of features first for it to effective. In particular, I found that the contrast:noise ratio of each PCC-transformed variable had no correlation with the latent of the PCC (even when the latent was 0). This means that PCA doesn't actually reduce the search space at all. *Edit: Also, none of the features actually seem to have a very high covariance.*

Have I missed some handy redundancy reduction

My current gig involves some machine-learning, while I'm asleep or otherwise engaged, so it's easy to lose days to trivial mistakes. Some of the people here must deal with this all the time: what tools and strategies do you use to handle it?

Some things seem obvious:

 * Make the code faster, running it on GPUs, running it on faster hardware, or just old-fashioned profiling and hotspot elimination. I've done some of this, and intend to do more - the 1-day runtime quoted above is after parallelisation.
 * Unit testing and static checks. I've been pretty lax about this
 * Making my code self-monitoring: watching for anomalous situations and logging warnings then handling them
I learned this one in a nasty way: an external tool that I invoked as part of my fitness function was failing when given certain combinations of arguments. This meant that there was no ""total energy"" line in its output
 * Periodically checkpoint the program's state
 * Output log data in a machine-readable fashion

... but I'm sure there's more to it than that.

I also have some more focussed questions:

 * People have suggested that I try watcher daemons or cron jobs to periodically restart my code if it hangs or dies. That makes sense for something like a web server
 * How do you handle the situation where your program is sitting there using up 100% CPU but producing no output?
 * How much logging do you do? How do you decide what to log?

The data to be classified is ~300k labeled reviews from the same domain. Due to legal reasons I am not able to train my classifier(s) with this data.

First

The presenting problem I have is that running k-means clustering on my data set results in almost everything being put in one cluster. I've tried varying the number of clusters but it keeps happening. I'd like to understand why this is happening and what my options are for getting a more even

Some background: I've gathered a list of friends and their likes from Facebook

    data = {
        'friend1': ['like1',
        'friend2': ['like4']
        'friend3': ['like1'
    }

There's about 100 friends with about 1 to 300 likes each. I make k centroids

Each iteration I calculate the distance between a friend and each centroid and assign them to the nearest. Almost all end up in the same centroid. To move the centroids to the average position of their members, but the centroid likes are floats. 

Any thoughts on why this is happening? Am I missing something or doing something wrong? Or is this data set not amenable to k-means

Thanks!

**edit** Still getting all friends in the same cluster despite

*(i)* creating a euclidian distance function

    def distance(self
        dist = 0.0
        for i
            if l != other.likes[i]:
                dist += 1
        
        return math.sqrt(diet)

The likes variables hold tuples where each item is 1 or 0 (like or dislike)

*(ii)*

On initialisation

*(iii)*

On each iteration

*(iv)*

No longer including the centroid's likes when calculating the average position between its members.

I've put my code on paste bin as I might have overlooked something - http://pastebin.com/ZFvFfFe3

Here's some example output:

    --- iteration 4
    {'cluster 0': {'dist': 1256.4364795929926
     'cluster 1': {'dist': 0.0
     'cluster 2': {'dist': 0.0
     'cluster 3': {'dist': 0.0
     'cluster 4': {'dist': 0.0
    --- iteration 5
    {'cluster 0': {'dist': 0.0
     'cluster 1': {'dist': 1256.4364795929926
     'cluster 2': {'dist': 0.0
     'cluster 3': {'dist': 0.0
     'cluster 4': {'dist': 0.0

Thanks for all of your input

**edit 2**

Fixed the distance function

    def distance(self
        total_dist = 0.0
        for i
            if l != other.likes[i]:
                total_dist += (l - other.likes[i])**2

        return math.sqrt(total_dist / len(self.likes))

The TL;DR is to add a term to the cost function of a model to prevent ensembles from learning the same representation of the data. I've thought about this for ensemble models and for neural networks (connected ensembles)

If the ensembled models are parameterized by some vector theta, squared difference, whatever. Then what we do is penalize the model for having a larger similarity measure with the other models by introducing a new term to the cost function. For each model, this could be some constant times the sum of similarity measures with all the other models. If we don't want the O( n^2 ) complexity, maybe we sample the other models at random, or choose a few at the beginning such that through multiple time steps each model can affect the others.

Any advice at all would be appreciated.",self,t5_2r3gv,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1dbnrb/need_advice_very_small_sample/

I know this isn't anything crazy, this method of creating a black and white photo could possible preserve more of the original qualities of the color version than just taking the average of the color pixels.

For the last few weeks I've been working on a backprop network and posting a few questions to this forum; I thank you for all the help so far. I've gone from concept

As a quick recap of my network - my network takes input/feature vectors of length 43

Unfortunately

Output value:0.90406 | Test value:0.9 (pretend to multiply all values by 100)

Output value:0.21558 | Test value:0.2

At first I'm like, this is too good to be true. Hmm, maybe it is. So I decide to try something - use the same test/target values, but create 162 completely *random* feature vectors. 

Uh oh - my network was able to fit the random training data *even better* than my actual training data! In fact

Output value:0.92 | Test value:0.92

Output value:0.62 | Test value:0.62

Output value:0.7 | Test value:0.7

Output value:0.77 | Test value:0.77

Now I'm thinking one of two possibilities:

1) Because I have so few training samples (only 162)

2) My original feature vectors are absolutely worthless

What do you guys think is going on

I'll describe what I've done and hopefully somone can point out if I've made any mistakes.

* The BM machine model is a set of binary units in which each unit is connected to every other unit via a weighted connection.

* First

* This learning phase can be divided into two parts - one is the empirical correlation between the units of the examples in the training set and one is the correlation between these units according to some probability model.

* At the end of learning

* We can then set our neurons to an input and run the activation model on them to recieve an output.

I realise as I type this that my understanding of the topic is really very fuzzy. Here's a few questions : 

Having trained the machine on a set of examples

I've found several RBM implementations online. How does a Restricted Boltzmann Machine differ from one with no hidden units? I'd like to be able to edit a RBM into what I've described so that I can make sure my implementation works the way it should.

The key Idea is that data is gathered by the conversations. This data can be used to train bots. Another strength is that the chatter bots stand in competition and can be tested.

The data-gathering idea is already there in [cleverbot](http://cleverbot.com/). But there is a key difference in this approach. In the original [Turing game](http://cogprints.org/499/1/turing.html) there is a human interrogator C, i.e. humans that can be used as training data. Imagine this on a large scale where many people play this game, as in google image labeler. This would bring a lot of good data with conversations that aim at the identification of chatbots. This data can then be used to further train chatbots.
