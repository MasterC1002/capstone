1370473361.0,1fr588,(Spoilers All) A dwarf's perspective on Tyrion Lannister.,FaceofMoe,7751,4177,684,"A few years ago I was out to coffee with my mother. We each brought a book as we usually do, cantankerous dwarf. I’ve read dozens of books that tackle disabled characters, when I discovered Tyrion I proceeded with trepidation

Tyrion’s experience, Tyrion deals with issues intimately familiar to dwarfs. He struggles with self-hate, frustration, humiliation, an intense desire to be loved, prevailing feelings of otherness. Tyrion demonstrates traits so often cultivated by the dwarf experience, wit and self-deprecation, one line of advice in the series speaks to the most frustrating

**Never forget what you are
                                  Game of Thrones-Jon (I)

**The truth of it is this: To be a dwarf is to be burdened with certain preconceived cultural conceptions of dwarfism, the dwarf has served as a source of either comedic relief or poignant tragedy. The Italian play *Les Gobbi* in the 1500’s utilized a variety of dwarf actors, each serving as absurd caricatures of difference preconceived elements of the dwarf. The tropes are many and enduring. 

The dwarf as the sexual deviant, a pitiful creature who may find some semblance of revenge in the third act. The comic dwarf, the happy sprite who spreads cheer and lightens dramatic tensions, magical and sexless, perhaps offering some encouragement and inspiration as needed. These shallow dramatic conventions endure, and have seeped into the zeitgeist. In fact, these dramatic conventions are so well established people seem to expect to see them exhibited in real dwarfs, no act is neutral. A dwarf must either comically struggle in a mis-sized world, tragic

Some dwarfs ignore these tropes, and try to living in opposition to them. They strive to break preconceived notions, to present a decidedly different idea of what being a dwarf means. Yet another sub-group takes a unique approach, the approach I have endorsed my whole life.

Tyrion knows his lot. He understands what being a dwarf means in his world. He has decided to embody these tropes, as protection in a world full to the brim with inhumanity. He becomes what others believe him to be, thus protecting the most vulnerable parts of himself. Tyrion is heart-breakingly lonely, profoundly unsatisfied with life, desperate to be seen as a full person. Yet as a kind of consolation, he has come to find some enjoyment in playing the motley fool, the perverse and lustful Imp, indulging in melodrama within his own internal monologue. (Ask “Where do whores go?” one more goddamned time…)

Now I’m no Tyrion. I’m obviously far less intelligent, filling a role that is larger and older then yourself. Public attention and gawking is just a part of being a dwarf. It is far better than to yell “Look at me!”, command a room, and seize control of the moment. I’m intrinsically tragic, intrinsically comic, these are true element my life extended to their greatest extent. I can no more escape these roles then escape my disability.  I’ve tried to explore these expectations, and turn them to my advantage. Learning to play with this narrative

There is a form of liberation to be found in performance, an all too rare thing for people with disabilities during any time. It allows for a transformation, a special kind of magic unique to being a dwarf. The world is our audience, paradoxically quick to listen intently to what we have to say, and just as quick to dismiss it. 

Every dwarf may be a bastard, the monster, and yes the Imp. I feel as if I’ve inherited a unique role, passed down for centuries. An odd sort of inheritance I’ll grant you, but one that can be absurdly fun. So when I saw George R.R Martin’s take on the dwarf experience, I immediately placed him as one of the greatest writers of our time, possessing a unique creative empathy so central to this series.

Tyrion as a character has made me better understand being a dwarf, my disability dominates who I am. I am a dwarf.  I’ll play the role as best as I am able, enjoy every capricious minute, and ride my dog into the sunset. 

**TL'DR: Tyrion is easily one of the best representations of the dwarf experience precisely because he acknowledges the roles others would place on him. His life becomes in essence a performance

-The Dreams and Hallucinations of Daenerys Targaryen upon the Dothraki Sea at the end of A Dance With Dragons

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In many ways

For Daenerys Targaryen, Daenerys has had some key phrases that are very telling about her understanding of herself: ""If I look back, I am lost."" ""I am the Mother of Dragons."" ""I am only a young girl."" But all of those things are lies, and in this last chapter, Daenerys is forced to confront those lies and comes to understand the truth about herself.

At the beginning of the chapter, after all:

&gt;It was time, a queen, a wife, a mother to thousands. Her children had need of her. Drogon had bent before the whip, and so must she. She had to don her crown again and return to her ebon bench and the arms of her noble husband.

This is, neither must the blood of the dragon. We'll return to that momentarily.

&gt;If I look back

So goes the internal monologue of Daenerys Targaryen for pages and pages. Yet, she begins to look back. She remembers her time with Drogo, and then with Viserys, and it brings another memory: Quaithe's warning that to go forward, she must go back. *Remember who you are, Daenerys Targaryen. The dragons know. Do you?* Not yet. 

Then she dreams of her dead brother Viserys, *Fire and Blood*. This is obviously untrue, Viserys was an incompetent fool who got the death that was coming to him. But Daenerys has this dream for a reason. She is awakening to her true self.

&gt;“I am the blood of the dragon

&gt;*Once

&gt;“Drogon killed a little girl. Her name was … her name …” Dany could not recall the child’s name. That made her so sad that she would have cried if all her tears had not been burned away. “I will never have a little girl. I was the Mother of Dragons.”

&gt;*Aye

Her name is Hazzea

After this forgetting

&gt;Meereen was not her home, where grace was earned through whoring, butchery was art, and dog was a delicacy. Meereen would always be the Harpy’s city, and Daenerys could not be a harpy.

And then the waking hallucination of Jorah Mormont tells her the same, now she is lost. But is it Daenerys Targaryen the Dragon who is lost, or is it the Mother?

&gt;*You took Meereen

&gt;*You are a queen, Jorah. I was weary of war. I wanted to rest, to laugh, to plant trees and see them grow. I am only a young girl.”

&gt;*No. You are the blood of the dragon.* The whispering was growing fainter

&gt;**“Fire and Blood

Half a page later...

&gt;She called until her voice was hoarse … and Drogon came,” she said.** Her bare legs tightened around the dragon’s neck. She kicked him, and Drogon threw himself into the sky. Her whip was gone, so she used her hands and feet and turned him north by east, the way the scout had gone. Drogon went willingly enough; perhaps he smelled the rider’s fear.

This is not the girl who killed her husband and walked into his funeral pyre. This isn't the young woman who frees slaves and plays ruler. This is a Dragon Queen, without a horn, without any assistance. This is the magic of Old Valyria, which always used either blood or fire(and Daenerys Targaryen is soaked in her own blood).

My conclusion is this: Daenerys, not just a young girl, not a queen who must learn to rule. She is a Targaryen who *knows her words*, which is even more important than knowing her name.

1372054078.0,1gyckw,(Spoilers All) Aerys Was (sort of) Right: The Tragedy of Rhaegar's Plot,eudaimonean,1285,227,314,"This is an old/semi-widely-discussed theory

A narrative below

-Aerys' reign begins. At first it shows much promise, and many of them lead to more harm than good.

-*The elder statesmen of the realm - Hoster Tully, and even Tywin Lannister - begin preparing to protect themselves against their liege's instability and/or depose him for the good of the realm.* They plan a web of marriage alliances between their houses, bringing in a fifth house, Baratheon, by including the young Robert (who is ward to Jon Arryn). Robert Baratheon to Lyanna Stark. Brandan Stark to Catelyn Tully. Lysa Tully to Jaime Lannister. **These bethrothals, if realized, create a potent axis: Baratheon-Stark-Tully-Lannister.** *Arryn is the only one left out, perhaps even its instigator) thanks to his wardship of Robert and Ned. At this point

-*Concurrently, but in the end, even he saw that this was true (Barristan, ADWD). *Gerold Hightower, Oswell Whent, and Arthur Dayne, the closest friend of Prince Rhaegar

-Kingsguard inner circle member Oswell Whent goes to his brother, the Tourney of Harenhall is held.** In attendance are Stark, Lannister, Tully, Arryn, the KG inner circle, and Rhaegar. *This tourney will be an opportunity for the plotters to hash out the means through which they will achieve the emerging objective of their plot: broadly, he rarely left the capital. However, we are led to believe that this is just another example of Aerys being crazy - typical GRRM narrative misdirection.] Aerys makes a surprise appearance and in a surprise move

-*Varys' intervention throws a roadblock in their schemes, is incommunicado for a while, and all hell breaks loose. Brandon Stark goes to KL and threatens Rhaegar's life. Rickard is summoned to KL to answer for his son. KG Commander Gerold Hightower witnesses Aerys executing them both, but is not in KL for the inevitable violent aftermath (!!) because *his primary loyalty is to Rhaegar, not Aerys, and he has ridden off, along with other members of the KG ""inner circle"" to consult with Rhaegar.* That the **commander of the Kingsguard and two of its most respected/deadly members are not at the King's disposal** right when a war is breaking out tells you a lot about the dynamics of the court at the time.

-At this point, and two new lords - Robert and Ned - ignorant of any previous plans and with agendas of their own, are now in play. Any hope for a peaceful resolution to the Aerys crisis is now lost. Whether they wanted it or not, the plotters have created a fight to the death against the Targaryen dynasty. *Tywin stays out of it for now because things are far too unpredictable for his liking - this was not the carefully orchestrated fait accompli he was anticipating.*

-Rhaegar finally returns to the capital, even though it's a fight to the death for Aerys, the KG inner circle and Rhaegar's confidants are at the Tower of Joy, *again because they answer to Rhaegar, not Aerys.* As he's leaving KL, he tells Jaime Lannister - now a junior member of the KG that he means to convene a great council to set things right once the rebellion is suppressed. The only previous great council we know of was the one that crowned Aegon V king following the death and uncertain succession of his father, Maekar. **So the precedence is that great councils are called to settle matters of succession—and Rhaegar wants to call a new one.** Sadly

--

**With that out of the way

**Imagine you're Rhaegar.** You are loved by all, even though as his heir any weakness of his actually makes you stronger. Nevertheless, he doesn't trust you and constantly suspects that you are plotting against him, which makes it all the more difficult for you to act against him because you don't want to contribute to his growing madness and want him to be at peace. 

Finally he goes so crazy - he even hurts your mother - that your friends convince you for the good of your realm not to look away any more. With a heavy heart, especially after you make an impulsive mistake out of love/lust/religious fanaticism. You end up dying in battle against the very people who were going to help you put the realm to rights, because circumstances have turned you into enemies.

**Now, forming marriage alliances with each other. Combined, they have power that threatens your own. This is troubling in and of itself, but meanwhile, everyone likes your heir more than they like you, including the leadership of your personal bodyguard! That's right, the people who are responsible for protecting your life are all the confidants of the man who takes over should you die! 

And they call you paranoid?! It's not paranoia if they're actually out to get you - and they ARE actually out to get you! But no one believes you, their rightful king. There's only one thing you can do. Burn them. Burn them all.

[As an aside - playing Crusader Kings 2 really helped me understand Aerys' POV. If in that game my vassals were forming a marriage alliance superbloc at the same time that everyone loved my heir and hated me

**Now, with minimal disruption to the realm. But there were a bunch of young hotheads involved - Brandon, Robert, and Rhaegar - and everything spun out of control. Now there's nothing left but to try and pick up the pieces. 

As Hand, one you've just learned is an even bigger sham than you realized. There will be war, again. The realm will bleed, again. All because you tried to make things better by putting a son ahead of his father. And now you are dying, your work unfinished, what little peace you accomplished about to unravel, and even you do not know that in the North an ancient threat is stirring that only an united Westeros would have had a chance to defeat.

This is my first venture into r/asoiaf territory

All of his characters have at least one thing that in a way defines them.  It can be something they love more than anything, or an entire way of thinking.  George then takes that thing away from them, which typically becomes a catalyst for change in character.  Although sometimes he does this at the end of their life without giving them a chance to overcome/reclaim it, and it's his go-to move when he wants to create a really tragic moment. *See: Eddard Stark.*

**Eddard Stark
    
**Catelyn Stark

**Sansa Stark
  
**Jaime Lannister, leaving him helpless in a fight.  Grows less fond of Cersei and even kind of loathes her.  
  
**Cersei Lannister, Being Queen, Beauty:**  Joffrey is murdered in front of her eyes.  Myrcella is shipped to Dorne and becomes severely wounded.  Jaime and her grow apart.  Gets imprisoned and paraded naked through the streets.  

**Jon Snow
  
**Robb Stark
  
**Tyrion Lannister
  
**Tywin Lannister, and his family claim to the throne is illegitimate.  Gets murdered on the pooper by his own son.

**Davos Seaworth, His Sons:**  He loses his fingers (again) and gets imprisoned for treason against his King by trying to murder Melisandre.  4 of his sons die in the Blackwater.  Devan becomes a servant of Melisandre, the very woman Davos tried to kill.
  
**Brienne of Tarth, though she survives it by sacrificing her vow to Jaime.
  
**Theon Greyjoy, Banging Chicks:**  Ends up hated and rejected by pretty much everyone he's ever known.  Name changed into something foul, Reek.  Disfigured and possibly castrated by Ramsay Snow.
  
**Oberyn Martell, and right before his face is smashed in, Gregor tells him that he raped Elia AFTER he killed her children, making her death even more horrible.

1374608701.0,1iwlno,(Spoilers All) Possibly the most overrated character of all time: Tywin Lannister,WenchSlayer,1324,440,538,"I see a lot of people on this subreddit as well as other places talk about Tywin Lannister as if he is some strategic demi-god

To begin, and he vastly outnumbered him. He is not famous for the battle itself, but rather being a huge dick afterwards. In Kings Landing he had the gates opened for him, and sacked the place. He might have gained in the short term, but made most people distrust  and despise him in the longrun.

But lets move on to the War of Five Kings

The biggest one of these in my opinion, with Tywin stuck in the riverlands. Tywin would then have Renly on one side and the Young Wolf on the other, making it only matter of time before he is crushed. Even if he manages to make it to Kings Landing before Renly, he stands no chance against the forces of Renly and Robb combined, and no amount of his deception and dickery will save him. 

Speaking of Robb, and him subsequently taking Winterfell was a stroke of dumb luck for Tywin, who was losing at this point. This causes Robb to be 'comforted' and lose his Frey men. Tywin also has nothing to do with Cat being dumb and letting Jaime go, causing Karstark to go kill the Lannister prisoners and make Robb lose his Karstark men. All of a sudden Robb has lost most of his army, and it has nothing to do with Tywin. All Tywin does is team  up with a couple of despicable dudes to finish off a Young Wolf who had pretty much defeated himself at this point.

Tactically everything Tywin did in the war of five kings was pretty much a farce. He was beat by Robb at every turn, and is only able to stop Stannis from taking it because of Tyrion's chain and wildfire and Littlefingers plotting bringing the Tyrells to his side. 

Tywins biggest strength is also his biggest weakness. All of his 'friends' despise him because of his ruthlessness and are constantly plotting against him. Littlefinger, The Martells, and others are constantly plotting against Tywin, and were all outplaying him. At the first sign of weakness all of house Lannister's 'friends' turn against them, because of the resentment Tywin created. His greatest ambition of securing the future of his house was set up for inevitable failure, even if he had lived.

Finally his dickishness is perhaps the greatest towards Tyrion, which all things considered,was a rather fitting end.

Cersei's prophecy is clearly lifted straight from Snow White. In fact

* The Queen in the tale is described as the most beautiful woman of the time. She is incredibly proud

* The Queen has a mirror. Cersei has her own mirror. The mirror is Jaime. Cersei who has slept with many men and a woman in her life only finds Jaime to be a pleasant company abed because she sees herself in him. 
&gt; Words are wind, he'd never lie to me. Even Robert thinks i am beautiful.


* The queen sends Snow White on a hunt to kill her. Our sweet Cersei sends Robert to a hunt to kill him.  

* The huntsman in Snow  White returns with a boar's organs which the Queen eats. Cersei gleefully consumes her own boar which slew Robert. She even comments on the hearty meal in a way only she can.

&gt;  There has never been a boar so delicious.

* The Queen attempts to kill Snow White even though Snow is only a child. Cersei has never shied away from partaking in the proud  Lannister family tradition of killing children.

* The Queen is warned of a more beautiful queen. Maggy warns Cersei of a younger more beautiful queen.

The Queen attempts to kill Snow White by poisoning her hair

* The hair net of Sansa is the poison in the hair.

* Strangulation is the way with which Joffrey dies. Joffrey consumes the poison called the Strangler. However

* The Queen's plans are constantly thwarted by meddling dwarves. Tyrion. 

*  The prophecy of the coming of Snow White and the younger queen of Cersei are told after a finger is pricked and a drop of blood is bled.

So

If this theory is correct

* The huntsman does not follow the Queen's orders and spares Snow White. Randyll Tarly now has the custody of the Margery and her cousins. He may refuse to kill the girls and help or allow them to escape.

* The queen  meets a morbid end after she is made to dance till she drops after she is made to  wear red hot iron shoes. Tongs are used to put them on. Iron shoes are mentioned only once in the series.

&gt; I love the Smith. Without his labor, the nails we use to build our ships, iron shoes to save the hooves of our faithful horses, the bright swords of our lords.

Do we know a smith who is also a not the eldest son? Why yes, i am sure she'll hear the news of Sansa's marriage before dying.

Jaime and Cersei often think that they'll die together. They could die at the same time. Nothing says that Jaime must kill her. So

1369234528.0,1eu4xn,(Spoilers ADWD) Tywin Lannister and Tyrion's Bedding,LOHare,978,164,312,"Background:

I'm pretty sure Tywin's character is well established among readers. From childhood

He is so grim and apprehensive all the time that he utterly lacks a sense of humour and will not tolerate any jape at him or his any of house-hold - even those he himself despises. All his actions and all his plans serve the power and prestige of house Lannister. Any personal gain or pleasure is secondary side-effect.

I am sure he loves his children in a fatherly fashion, but because he cares about the Lannister name. He arranges the marriages of his children, not for their happiness, not for his personal gain, but for securing the power of his house.

This is his feeling towards his own children

The Bedding:

Joffery is ready to **command** that the ceremony takes place, all but ensuring that in retaliation Joffery will not only stand his ground, but make things worse.

Tywin steps in not only to diffuse the situation, but definitely won't stand an insult to a Lannister. 

He knows how unstable and rash Joffery his, it was more than the prestige of his house that moved him to this decision. I think for once (other than his smile at his own wedding), we get a glimpse of the softer side of Tywin. Ser Barristan's narration to Dany in ADWD about Tywin's wedding:

&gt;The white knight chose his words with care. “Prince Aerys … as a youth, your father drank too much wine at the wedding feast and was heard to say that it was a great pity that the lord’s right to the first night had been abolished. A drunken jape, no more, but **Tywin Lannister was not a man to forget such words, or the … the liberties your father took during the bedding**.” His face reddened. “I have said too much, Your Grace. I—”

Tywin saw the exact same thing repeated. A douchebag royalty drunk with power and lust seeking to take liberties with the wife of a Lannister. He knows how it feels and he is not one to forget it. I think in this scene he is protecting his son Tyrion more than his house Lannister. I really think this move was made more out of sentiment than cold calculation.

Of course there were other reasons as well. Tyrion was drunk and since he had already thrust a knife in the table and uttered the threat in full view of everyone,,False,self,t5_2r2o9,1369235628.0,,True

1371217793.0,1gc5hw,(Spoilers All) George Costanza Theory,mistakenotmy,989,212,460,"Over not a small number of beers

Below are our ideas and what brought us to them.  This is not very fleshed out and only hits some high points.  Also our depth of knowledge is not as deep as many of you here.  We would love help filling this in and hearing your own “George Costanza” theories.


 - Aegon wins with dragons!!  Marries Margaery Tyrell (because they all do) Tyrells power behind throne.  
(Neither of us is very supportive of a character that is introduced in the 5th book that could end up winning the game.  So of course that is what will happen.)

 - Dany - Killed by Drogon when Victarion makes Daario blow the Horn.  
(Neither of us is sure about Victarion but we do both want Daenerys to ride her dragons to victory. So this cannot happen.  What is the worst outcome?  To us it’s a mother being slain by her children.  Daario being killed is a side bonus for an overall horrible end to Dany.) 

 - Victarion - Returns to Westeros with dragons and at some point loses dragons to Aegon.   
(This is just a consequence of the first two points.  No idea how it would work)

 - Bran - Chronicler only - stays tree forever.  
(We both want Bran to do something and kick ass, and Hodor TBD)

 - Jaime - Killed protecting Cercie  
(We both like Jaime and dislike Cersei.  So for Jaime to be honorable and die protecting his sister, and could be done really well, we both just don’t want him to die.  So of course he will die.  As a side note we started off by having everyone we like die, but that would be extreme, then again it is GRRM.)

 - Connington dies from greyscale and Roose Bolton becomes hand of the king.  
(this follows from the first point.  If Aegon does win

 - White Walkers - also win. They win in the north and the final vestiges of the Starks land.  If the South does pull together they stop the White Walkers at the neck or eventually push them back to the neck after rampaging in the South.  Either way the North is lost to the White Walkers.  
(We really want a giant battle on the wall with armies of knights vs undead and dragons vs white walkers.  So

 - Dorne - still bullshit  
(We are both ok with Dorne but couldn’t help referencing the youtube video we love) [link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGUKDZFiy-A)

 - Arya becomes faceless man and has a successful career.  
(One nice thing anyway…)

 - Rickon becomes a wildling  
(Rickon turned out to serve no purpose)

 - Jon snow – Stays dead and R+L=J is never confirmed after death.  
(Fairly obvious that we want Jon to be the opposite of this and kick ass at the wall)

 - Sansa marries Littlefinger - Littlefinger king or the north/ashes  
(?? we didn't really get far with this one)

 - Brienne searches till the end but never finds the Stark girls.  
(Again a plot line that we want to turn into something cool but will turn to nothing instead)

 - Ramsey befriends Qyburn - Much fun is had 

 - Stannis defaults on his loan from Iron Bank and is killed by Arya.  While in the north to take out Stannis

 - Tyrion rides a donkey in a midget show/juggler for the rest or his life.  
(Because that would suck)

1353419249.0,13ib1b,"[Spoilers all] Littlefinger has badly outplayed Varys so far, but what's next?",feldman10,866,127,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/13ib1b/spoilers_all_littlefinger_has_badly_outplayed/

&gt; Littlefinger: “Leave Lord Varys to me… I hold the man’s balls in the palm of my hand.""

The following is my analysis of the game Littlefinger and Varys have been playing in the series so far. Let me know what parts you agree with or disagree with.

**Ultimate goals:**

* Littlefinger: Power for himself

* Varys: Aegon on the Iron Throne

**Opening move and initial strategy:**

* Littlefinger gets Lysa to poison Jon Arryn. He intends to divide Westeros with civil war ASAP

* Varys marries Dany off to the Dothraki. He intends to divide Westeros with civil war… eventually.  Then Drogo and the Golden Company can conquer the continent and install Aegon on the throne. But the time isn't right for war yet. This disagreement over the proper timing of a civil war puts Littlefinger and Varys (unknowingly) at odds.

&gt; “Illyrio: ""Too soon

**Middle of AGOT:**

* Littlefinger tells Catelyn that the dagger was Tyrion's. 

* LF's pawns move forward: Cat seizes Tyrion

* Varys panics to Illyrio that war is coming much faster than they expected (though he hasn't grasped the extent of Littlefinger's role in bringing this about). ""The khal will not bestir himself until his son is born

* So Varys tells Robert that Dany is pregnant, either way he gets what he wants -- an angry Drogo stampeding west.

* One result of this move by Varys is that Ned feuds with Robert, so there will be war. So Littlefinger counters Varys again -- delaying Ned's departure by all of a sudden revealing the location of Robert's bastard daughter at a brothel. Ned goes to check it out, and lo and behold, the news that Cat has taken Tyrion has suddenly reached Jaime, who attacks Ned. Tensions are spiraling out of control.

* Varys keeps trying to stabilize things, then betrays him, cementing his place in the Lannister court.

&gt; Varys: “If there was one soul in King’s Landing who was truly desperate to keep Robert Baratheon alive

**End of AGOT:**

* As Varys awaits word from Jorah

* Littlefinger says, war is certain. 

* So LF wins this round

&gt; Tywin: ""Alive

**ACOK-ADWD: LF's continued ascent

* For the rest of the series so far

* Littlefinger arranges each new step of his meteoric rise in Westeros

* Varys' only immediate concern in Westeros is maintaining his position at court, Aegon's conquest will be assured. But this time he's foiled by his own spy Jorah, who tells Dany to go to Slaver's Bay and get an army of her own. Then, Varys' position at court is compromised because of Jaime's meddling. Varys tries to roll with the punches and send Aegon to go meet Dany -- but he's foiled again by Tyrion, who convinces the boy to go west and abandon the dragons. 

* Varys is playing an inherently more difficult game than LF -- his goal is to put a specific person on the throne rather than merely to aggrandize himself. But even with this in mind,"" the eunuch says, ""I guess I have to make this happen without Dothraki or dragons."" So people in King's Landing start to get assassinated...

**What's next?** 

* Varys' hand has been forced, see his true skill as he pulls out all the stops to get Aegon on the throne. For years, he's likely been preparing various major and minor contingency plans all around Westeros for Aegon's arrival, and now he will have to set them all in motion.  Then, even if Aegon does take King's Landing, Varys will have to deal with a potentially mistrustful Dany who will have three dragons and a devious dwarf at her side -- but first things first. 

* Littlefinger, but by now LF has also certainly heard reports of the Targaryen queen with 3 dragons. LF may thrive on chaos, but this is a little much, especially considering he has been most effective operating from the inside, and he has no likely entree to either Aegon or Dany's camp.

* Some have suggested that LF's best next move would be to marry Sansa to Aegon -- with the forces of Dorne,"" and the Golden Company, Westeros will be theirs. But with Varys backing Aegon this is unlikely to get LF the unrivaled power in Westeros he so desires, and if Dany shows up and wars with Aegon, this could be a fatal mistake. 

* Another complication is the likely rise of the only potential player who can reach Varys and LF's level -- Tyrion. He will likely be at Dany's side -- he hates Littlefinger

* So I would recommend that LF try to stoke a war between Aegon and Dany and stay out of the conflict. Another round of destruction in the south would make the military and agricultural power of the Vale, keep her in reserve to eventually be queen of Westeros. If necessary, kneel to the side with dragons and try to stay as far away from those dragons (and Tyrion) as possible, so you'll live to plot another day.

* And I wouldn't count out Varys yet easier. Most people assume that Aegon will end up roasted by a dragon. But surely Varys will be aware of this possibility and try to keep Aegon away from the dragons if Dany seems antagonistic. Even if Dany temporarily puts Aegon's forces on the ropes, Dorne will have backed Aegon and will be angry about Quentyn's death). If Aegon and Varys manage to survive an initial clash with Dany, they could very well defeat her in the long-term, despite the dragons.

* My literary prediction is that during book 7, dragons and Others, a separate political contest will be unfolding between Tyrion, Varys, and Littlefinger to determine the ultimate victor in the game of thrones.

1376332390.0,1k80pg,(Spoilers All) The Endgame of the Faceless Men,shopeIV,884,155,307,"This theory has to do with what I believe the endgame of the Faceless Men is

**The Faceless Men and the Doom**

In AFFC,

&gt; ""All gods have their instruments, but to one god with a hundred different faces . . . and he was that god’s instrument. That very night he chose the most wretched of the slaves, the one who had prayed most earnestly for release, and freed him from his bondage. The first gift had been given.""
Arya drew back from him. ""He killed the slave?"" That did not sound right. ""He should have killed the masters!""
""He would bring the gift to them as well . . . but that is a tale for another day

I believe the Kindly Man is insinuating that the Faceless Men brought about the Doom (giving the gift to the masters) and that he is waiting until he truly believes Arya is ""no one"" to tell her the full story.

About 600 years before the beginning of the series Hardhome is destroyed.  

&gt;Hardhome had been halfway toward becoming a town, depending on which version of the tale you believed, their homes and halls consumed in a conflagration that burned so hot that watchers on the Wall far to the south had thought the sun was rising in the north. Afterward ashes rained down on haunted forest and Shivering Sea alike for almost half a year. Traders reported finding only nightmarish devastation where Hardhome had stood, a landscape of charred trees and burned bones, waters choked with swollen corpses, blood-chilling shrieks echoing from the cave mouths that pocked the great cliff that loomed above the settlement. 

In ADWD,

&gt;It was written that on the day of the Doom every hill for five hundred miles had split asunder to fill the air with ash and smoke and fire, temples, entire towns. Lakes boiled or turned to acid, mountains burst, fiery fountains spewed molten rock a thousand feet into the air, red clouds rained down dragonglass and the black blood of demons, and to the north the ground splintered and collapsed and fell in on itself and an angry sea came rushing in.

To me these two tales sound remarkably similar.  The destruction of Hardhome happened nearly 200 years prior to the Doom

**Dragon Eggs**
Throughout the series there are many mentions of the dangers associated with attempting to hatch dragon eggs.  In ASOS

&gt;Did we learn nothing from Aerion Brightfire

In ADWD,

&gt; ending at Summerhall in sorcery

In AFFC

&gt;the smoke was from the fire that devoured Summerhall on the day of his [Rhaegar's] birth

Additionally

&gt; ""I see you. I see you, I need none of yours. Begone from here, dark heart. Begone!""

Clearly she has suffered from what occurred at Summerhall. However

Clearly some cataclysmic event costing lives occurred at Summerhall. Additionally

My theory is that the Faceless men did something with dragon eggs inside the valcanos at Hardhome and the Fourteen Fires (perhaps fourteen eggs in fourteen different volcanoes here) to cause destruction.  When the Valyrians first discovered the dragons they were lairing in the Fourteen Fires. However

**Euron Greyjoy

Like most people I believe

&gt; ""I dreamt of a man without a face

We know from Littlefinger in AGOT that the price for the Faceless Men to kill a King would be astronomical but we also know from Arya that the price is always payable if the client is willing.  Euron claims that he once had a dragon's egg but

&gt; ""I threw it into the sea during one of my dark moods.""

Euron is insane

Along with most people I believe Jaqen has infiltrated the Citadel as Pate and is attempting to steal the only remaining copy of the book ""The Death of the Dragons"" that Tyrion mentions in ADWD. I think this is insurance for the Faceless Men should their main attempt to kill Daenery's dragons fail and they need another way to kill them.

**The Endgame**

There is a lot of instances of the Braavosi sharing their opinions of dragons which is not high.  Even if the Braavosi and the Faceless Men think Daenerys is doing a good thing by freeing slaves. I think the fear the mere existence of dragons.  What if Daenerys dies

I believe the Faceless Men know Daenerys will eventually come to Westeros and they will allow her to free slaves across Essos on her way there.  One place I think they know Daenerys will visit is Dragonstone. Not only is it the ancestral home of the Targaryen's but it is the place of Daenerys' birth.  We know that the Dragonmont on Dragonstone is an active valcano and I think the Faceless Men will attempt to recreate the Doom with Euron's dragon egg here when Daenerys (eventually) arrives.

**TL;DR The Faceless Men will use the dragons egg they received from Euron to attempt to recreate the Doom on Dragonstone when Daenerys arrives.**

I am not 100% sure of this theory but I do think the pieces fit and it is possible and would like to hear others thoughts on it.

Meereen is about to be the awesomest and most epic blood bath in the entire series so far.

2. The most hardcore navy in the world is sailing there in force to pay the iron price for some serious shit.

3. The most hardcore cavalry in the world is heading there (I think) with Mrs. Fire and Blood

5. Half of the free cities are at war with Dany

6. There is a plague killing everybody in brutal

7. The most hardcore foot soldiers in the world are already there

7. Two of the three main characters of the series

***

##WHO WAS MANDON MOORE?

Jaime described him as one of the most dangerous men in the Kingsguard

Varys gives us the best insight into Ser Mandon when Tyrion questions him:

&gt;Bronn had turned up all he could on Ser Mandon
“Sadly, sadly. You might find some kin if you turned over enough stones back in the Vale, but here . . . Lord Arryn brought him to King’s Landing and Robert gave him his white cloak, but neither loved him much, I fear. Nor was he the sort the smallfolk cheer in tourneys, despite his undoubted prowess. Why, even his brothers of the Kingsguard never warmed to him. Ser Barristan was once heard to say that the man had no friend but his sword and no life but duty . . . but you know, is it not? Those are the very qualities we seek in our Kingsguard, with sword in hand
*Trying to murder one of the king’s own blood

^(ASOS 12: TYRION II)

From this we know Ser Mandon originally came from the Vale and was brought to King's Landing by Jon Arryn. We also see that he had few friends and seemingly no allegiances but to his own duty. Who put him up to murdering Tyrion? Let's explore the candidates...

***

##SELF-MOTIVATED

It is possible that Ser Mandon killed Tyrion of his own volition. He is a generally non-reactive character

&gt;“Ser Mandon, who was captain of Lord Arryn’s household guard?”  
“I know the man.” Ser Mandon’s eyes were pale grey
“Knew
Ser Mandon did not deign to show that he had heard that.

^(ACOK 3: TYRION I)

Later Ser Mandon is assigned as Sansa's personal guard when the riot occurs after Myrcella is seen off. Tyrion scolds him and Ser Boros for losing track of her:

&gt;“Ser Mandon
Ser Mandon Moore remained untroubled. “When they mobbed the Hound
[...]  
Tyrion had stomached all he cared to. “The Others take your fucking cloaks! *Take them off* if you’re afraid to wear them

^(ACOK 41: TYRION IX)

Based on the above quotes it's possible Ser Mandon had a grudge with Tyrion and decided to take matters into his own hands on the Blackwater. However

***

##CERSEI

Clearly Cersei had the motives to kill Tyrion. In general there was little love lost between the two, and she believed him to be her *valonquar*.

Tyrion himself believes her to be the clear choice:

&gt;*Cersei must have paid him to see that I never came back from the battle. Why else? I never did Ser Mandon any harm that I know of.* Tyrion touched his face

^(ACOK 67: TYRION XV)

&gt;Here in Maegor’s Holdfast, sent to finish the work Ser Mandon had begun.  
[...]  
“[...] I’ve been here twice
“Not dead. Though my sweet sister did try.” Perhaps he should not have said that aloud

^(ASOS 4: TYRION I)

However

* If it was Cersei
* For these mystery assassination attempts
* The three Kingsguard she felt were in her pocket were Boros Blount, who notably had no allegiance to anyone.

Even Tyrion found it odd that Cersei used Ser Mandon instead of the other three:

&gt;He’d known that Ser Meryn and Ser Boros were his sister’s

^(ACOK 67: TYRION XV)

Additionally

&gt;When Ser Lancel Lannister told the queen that the battle was lost, ser.” Her voice was distant, as if the news were of no great interest to her.

^(ACOK 62: SANSA VII)

Also

***

##WHO ELSE?

Tyrion certainly had his fair share of enemies beyond just Cersei. Any number of people had motive to kill him:

* **Tywin** - General dislike and to keep Tyrion from inheriting Casterly Rock.
* **Joffrey** - He's a royal cunt and Tyrion wasn't his favorite person.
* **Pycelle** - Tyrion clipped his chain

I don't think it was any of the people above. Tywin was off warring and it seems odd to appoint Tyrion as Hand to fix things only to have him killed at a point of uncertainty.  Pycelle was locked in a dungeon and had no relationship with Ser Mandon we know of. Joffrey could've certainly ordered Ser Mandon, Joffrey was shitting in his pants from fear during the battle and he not have wanted Tyrion dead at that particular moment, because he seemed to be the only one keeping it all together.

That leaves two people who generally seem to be behind everything...

***

##VARYS

We know Varys's motivation at this point in the story was to weaken the realm so that Aegon can more easily conquer it. He later kills Kevan for being too competent a Hand and arguably manipulated the circumstances for Tyrion to kill Tywin for the same reasons. Perhaps he wanted to kill Tyrion on the Blackwater for being a competent Hand as well.

From the first quote above we see that Tyrion suspects Varys knows more than he is telling about Ser Mandon. There is also the line about how Varys ""gave him [Tyrion] a slimy smile and watched him sharply"". So if Varys knows more than he is telling

One explanation is that even if Varys knows it was Littlefinger

Varys had seemingly no relationship with Ser Mandon, and I don't think he wanted to do away with a piece as valuable as him quite yet.

Which brings us to...

***

##LITTLEFINGER

Ser Mandon was brought to King's Landing from the Vale along with Jon Arryn. Littlefinger was also brought to court by Jon Arryn at the same time, that someone else perhaps being Littlefinger.

Littlefinger was in Bitterbridge for much of the time leading up to the Blackwater, one of whom (Osmund) is even on the Kingsguard with Ser Mandon.

But what was Littlefinger's motive? In AGOT Littlefinger tells Catelyn he lost his dragonbone-hilt Valyrian dagger (the same one used by Bran's would-be assassin) in a bet to Tyrion. This turned out to be a lie. The truth was that Tyrion lost the dagger in a bet to Robert

When Tyrion arrives in King's Landing as Hand the issue of the dagger comes up with Littlefinger:

&gt;“That’s a handsome knife as well.”  
“Is it?” There was mischief in Littlefinger’s eyes. He drew the knife and glanced at it casually, though. It’s yours, if you would like it.”  
“Mine?” Tyrion gave him a long look. “No. I think not. Never mine.” *He knows

^(ACOK 17: TYRION IV)

Protecting this lie could be one motive for Littlefinger to kill Tyrion

&gt;“Lysa is more tractable than Catelyn
“She believes she has good reason. When I was her guest in the Eyrie, she might think more kindly of me.”  
**That made Littlefinger sit up**. “True killer? I confess
It was Tyrion’s turn to smile. “Gifts I give my friends

^(ACOK 17: TYRION IV)

Littlefinger is rarely taken by surprise and I think Tyrion truly rattled him here. The irony is that Tyrion thought it was Pycelle that poisoned Jon Arryn

&gt;“I love you as much as I ever have, can she?”  
“Not without causing a great scandal, but when we spoke, I could not know the Dornishmen would accept my offer.”  
Littlefinger was not appeased. “I do not like being lied to

^(ACOK 25: TYRION VI)

Given this it's clear that Littlefinger had motive, thus making it the third time he's sought to undermine Tyrion.

**4. Where Do We Go From Here?** What will happen now that Jaqen (if that is his real name), or will the maesters succeed in extinguishing the last flames of magic?

-------------------------------------------

##1. The Maester's Conspiracy/Faceless Men

I'm sure most of you have a pretty good understanding of this theory

We will first start off with the cause of magic in the universe of ASOIAF. From the ASOIAF wiki, there is a correlation between dragons and magic.

So eliminating dragons might eliminate magic

Well, Daenerys I). Since then, dragons grew smaller and smaller. After the Dance of Dragons, the species became somewhat endangered. Many people believe(d) this to be the confinement of dragons in pits.

Here's the proof that that is wrong. After killing the Meereenese girl Hazzea, Daenerys II). It should have the same effect, right? Wrong. Later, when she first visits the dragon pit, she realizes that Viserion has grown larger despite confinement.

So we know that there was another reason for the dragons becoming weaker and stronger. The theory that dragons were supposed to live free in the skies instead of chains, they were pretty far from the mark.

Now that we have a little bit of suspicion

&gt; As Maester Medrick went to one knee to whisper in Bolton's ear, living on the leavings of the lords, chittering to one another, whispering in the ears of their masters. But who are the masters and who are the servants, truly? 

&gt; ""Every great lord has his maester, even for such lords as cannot read themselves, and who can say for a certainty that they are not twisting the words for their own ends? What good are they, I ask you?""

&gt;""They heal

&gt; ""They heal, there they are.

&gt; ""Sometimes they heal us, and we are grateful for that as well. Out of gratitude we give them a place beneath our roof and make them privy to all our shames and secrets, a part of every council. And before too long, the ruler has become the ruled.

**Here's where it gets important**

&gt; ""That was how it was with Lord Rickard Stark. Maester Walys was his grey rat's name. And isn't it clever how the maesters only go by one name

&gt; ""Before he had forged his chain, Rivers, Snow...we give such names to baseborn children to mark them for what they are, but they are always quick to shed them. Walys Flowers had a Hightower girl for a mother...and an archmaester of the Cidatel for a father, it was rumored. The grey rats are not as chaste as they would have us believe. Oldtown maesters are the worst of all.

&gt; ""Once he forged his chain, he -"" She broke off as Roose Bolton rose to his feet, pale eyes shining in the torchlight.

I believe there is another, but I'm not going to waste so much space copying it. Basically the jist of her story is that the maesters were responsible for setting Robert's Rebellion into motion, even if Rhaegar was the spark that lit the kindling they were building.

So what's the point of destabilizing the realm and possibly unseating the Targaryens? I don't think we know that yet. But it still fits in with the idea of the maesters being more than they seem.

I think the final piece of evidence leads into the next topic easily. The fact that the archmaesters of the Citadel are conspiring

From AFFC's prologue:

&gt; Armen pursed his lips in disapproval. ""Marwyn is unsound. Archmaester Perestan would be the first to tell you that.""

&gt; ""Archmaester Ryam says too

&gt; Leo yawned. ""The sea is wet

Moments later

&gt; The Mage was not like other maesters. People said that he kept company with whores and hedge wizards, in rat pits and black brothels, consorting with mummers, singers, sellswords, even beggars. Some even whispered that he once killed a man with his fists.

&gt; When Marwyn had returned to Oldtown after *spending eight years to the east mapping distant lands* (aside: not sure if this is significant at all, and studying with warlocks and shadowbinders, Vinegar Vaellyn had dubbed him ""Marwyn the Mage."" The name was soon over Oldtown, to Vaellyn's vast annoyance. ""Leave spells and prayers to priests and septons and bend you wits to learning truths a man can trust in,"" Archmaester Ryam had once counseled Pete, but Ryam's ring and rod and mask were yellow gold, and his maester's chai had no link of Valyrian Steel.

The Valyrian steel link alludes to higher mysteries - prophecy, we see Marwyn, who has traveled far and wide, possibly even to Asshai and Valyria and other magical places, who believes in magic, versus the archmaesters who deny any truth. We've already seen magic, so we know whose right, where the correct person is thought of as somewhat of a conspiracy theorist.

Later, Marwyn, and Pate (suspected to be Jaqen H'gar, but I'll get to that later):

&gt; ""Aemon would have gone to [Daenerys] if he had the strength. He wanted us to send a maester to her

&gt; ""Did he?"" Archmaester Marwyn shrugged. ""Perhapes it's good that he died before he got to Oldtown. Elsewise

&gt; ""Kill him?"" Sam said

&gt; ""If I tell you, much less for dragons. Ask yourself why Aemon Targaryen was allowed to waste his life upon the Wall, when by rights, he should have been raised to archmaester. His *blood* was why. He could not be trusted. **No more than I can.**""

&gt; ""What will you do?"" asked Alleras

&gt; ""Get myself to Slaver's Bay, I would do it quickly. A time will come when you'll be needed on the Wall."" He turned to [Pate].

This recurring piece of jewelry got me thinking, gets progressively less 'Southron' in style the more she is disillusioned with the South.

Anyway, who ends up being called the Prince of Dragonflies and is famous for giving up his crown in order to marry his love Jenny of Oldstones.  

Interestingly, in a Catelyn POV.

&gt;""Oldstones, on their way to Seagard. *Petyr was with us too...*

&gt;""There's a song

&gt;""We're all just songs in the end. If we are lucky."" She had played at being Jenny that day

Now let us flash back to when Sansa first met Littlefinger at the Tourney of the Hand.  In the books she has just won the flower from Ser Loras.  In the TV series she is wearing her dragonfly necklace.

&gt;When Sansa finally looked up, wit a pointed beard and a silver streak in his hair, almost as old as her father. ""You must be one of her daughters,"" he said to her. He had grey-green eyes that did not smile when his mouth did. ""You have the Tully Look.""

&gt;""I'm Sansa Stark, fastened with a silver mockingbird, and he had the effortless manner of a high lord, but she did not know him. ""I have not had the honor, my lord.""

&gt;Septa Mordane quickly took a hand. ""Sweet child

&gt;""Your mother was *my* queen of beauty once

Creepiness aside, the same age as when Petyr and Catelyn first played as the Prince of Dragonflies and Jenny of Oldstones when they were children.  He remark on her ""Tully look"" and that she has the same hair as her mother.

People often remark how Littlefinger has an obvious and uncomfortable attraction to Sansa, Littlefinger hadn't seen Catelyn since the ill-fated duel with Brandon Stark.  His entire image and love for her was formed around the Catelyn he had grown up with; a pretty, naive, highborn lady with auburn hair and a love for songs.  Then twenty years later, along comes Sansa, who is in every way the splitting image of the Catelyn of his youth.  This explains why his introduction to Sansa was far less smooth than suits Littlefinger; he is in shock.  He speaks to her quietly and abruptly leaves after stroking her hair.

I believe Petyr first fell in love with Cat at Oldstones.  Catelyn was ""no more than twelve"" and they had played as lovers in a song.  It was announced that Catelyn was betrothed to Brandon Stark when she was twelve, leading him to constantly try to seduce her.

[ADWD](/s ""Littlefinger never stopped loving ""only Cat"", as it set up the events to eventually make her Lady of the Vale.  Littlefinger showed his true love and motivation then.  This also explains why we see no signs of distress from him regarding the death of Catelyn at the Twins.  Sansa is his Cat and he had no need for the mature, intelligent woman Catelyn had become."")

Yet what does this have to do with the Prince of Dragonflies?  Well, nicknamed ""Littlefinger"" is parallel to Duncan, who was nicknamed ""the small"".

This gives a possible hint to the downfall of Littlefinger.  Duncan the Small gave up his crown for his love of Jenny of Oldstones.  It hints that Littlefinger, for his love.  Petyr had already been willing to risk everything for his love for Catelyn by dueling Brandon.

Finally there is a beautiful, and the naive Sansa, who see's the world in songs.  Yet If Littlefinger's love for Catelyn/Sansa is his downfall, his downfall would be a repeat of the Prince of Dragonflies.  The most cunning man in the Seven Kingdoms would fall because of a song, the song to which he fell in love.

His pack of vicious dogs that Ramsay uses to hunt people.  Here is the text I've found regarding the dogs.  They are mentioned in almost every Theon POV

&gt;""They were just outside the camp when the baying of a pack of hounds told of Lord Ramsay’s approach. Whoresbane was with him, and the Walders Big and Little too. The dogs swarmed around them, snapping and snarling at the strangers. The Bastard’s girls, Reek thought, before he remembered that one must never, never, never use that word in Ramsay’s presence.""
_____________________________________
&gt;""The dogs were on him before he could puzzle out which, circling him, jumping up to lick his filthy face, nipping at his legs. Helicent caught his left. hand between her teeth and worried it so fiercely Reek feared he might lose two more fingers. Red Jeyne slammed into his chest and knocked him off his feet. She was lean, hard muscle, where Reek was loose, grey skin and brittle bones
_____________________________________
&gt;""He would eat later, and provided the night’s best entertainment, when Maude and Grey Jeyne tore into one of Lord Stout’s hounds over an especially meaty bone that Will Short had tossed them. Reek was the only man in the hall who did not watch the three dogs fight. He kept his eyes on Ramsay Bolton.""

&gt;""The fight did not end until their host’s dog was dead. Stout’s old hound never stood a mummer’s chance. He had been one against two, and savage. Ben Bones, who liked the dogs better than their master, had told Reek they were all named after peasant girls Ramsay had hunted, raped, and killed back when he’d still been a bastard, running with the first Reek. “The ones who give him good sport, Reek did not doubt. “He’s trained ’em to kill wolves as well

Theon is building a very trusting relationship with Ramsay's dogs. To the point where they consider him part of their pack.  Even mean-spirited dogs will protect their own pack.

My best guess (with a lot of details left out) is that we're going to see Ramsay tracking Theon with his dogs.  After he finds Theon and ""Arya"" it's probably going to look like Theon is fucked beyond all help.  Ramsay starts beating him badly but the dogs are going to protect their pack.

It is not hard to see why this is always referenced. It's gross, and even the image it conjures up is absurd. It is about as antithetical to sexy and/or exciting as writing can be. If GRRM was trying to write a good, decent, or even non-goofy sex scene, it would be terrible writing. 

Thing is, so the narration is filtered through the perspective of the Pov character in question. Martin's goal, then, prosewise, is not to string together an ornate or evocative series of words. He's not a poet. What he's (ideally) trying to do is convey a particular emotion that syncs with whatever the character is currently feeling.

So: Sam is an awkward fat kid who on some subconscious level has probably long since chalked up his odds of getting laid to a firm 0%. Suddenly

So Sam looks down and his...equipment looks like a ""fat pink mast"". That's a pretty ludicrous image, even if dude is enjoying and goin' with it on a visceral level.

So, and the guy who originated the tradition of George knighting his fans at WorldCon. And this is a story - a tragedy, really, about another fan and who George honored him.

You might have noticed ""House Manwoody of Kingsgrave"" in the books. They're a minor house and it's kind of a weird name, and incredibly accomplished. His name was Michael - I'll leave his last name out of it for reasons that will become clear.

Way back in 2001 the World Science Fiction Convention was in Philadelphia, and forged a bond of friendship that has lasted. Michael lived in Australia but, but was an active member and mod on the ASOIAF boards that were, and still are, the center of AGOT fandom. The next year he got a very prestigious post teaching international law at Penn. That's when I met him, and he was a great guy, incredibly knowledgeable and with impeccable taste

He had a gift for teaching people about the things he loved - running, he immediately ordered up a storm and talked me through every nuance and flavor of each single malt. It started a lifelong love of good scotch for me. Anyway, Manwoody (his name on the board) had the same effect on everyone, and as a Falstaffian lover-of-life, George Martin admired him too. Every year at WorldCon we got together, the whole gang. One year, Manwoody told us he was doing the ""Grand Tour"" in fine style before returning home to Australia. He traipsed all over Europe, and writing a series of opera criticisms that were published and are still well regarded.

And then he went home and killed himself. We were all stunned. Stunned. Here was a man at the very top of his game - widely admired and with an impressive career as well as avocation. And it turns out he had been diagnosed with a terminal, he went out at the height of his powers.

We were shattered. Shattered. George was too. And so in his honor, and the author who memorialized him. Tonight I'll have a scotch in his honor.

Edit: A few people pointed out that the first appearance of the Manwoodys was in 2000, not the reverse. However, a character named after and in honor of him exists 'in canon' and will appear soon; this straight from the horse's mouth. This isn't quite as touching, I'm afraid, as the story as I understood it. No purposeful deception occurred on my part, and I apologize for the confusion. Many other people had precisely the same recollection that I did, and we're all surprised.

Introduction
-

About a month ago, [Part 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1i0dz2/spoilers_all_a_complete_analysis_of_robb_stark_as/)), and I figured that the next character from the series that I wanted to analyze militarily was **Stannis Baratheon.** I'm going to try to accomplish it in 3 parts. Part 1 will be looking at Stannis's military accomplishments in the events leading up the books, part 2 will deal with the War of the Five Kings and part 3 will be an analysis/speculation post on how all this combined information may play out in the upcoming Battle in the Ice. 

Stannis Baratheon is a favorite among fans of the series (though much less popular among the in-story characters from ASOIAF). Fans seem to love his [dust-dry wit](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1joh46/spoilers_all_lets_take_a_minute_to_recognise_this/), Stannis is a *good* battlefield commander. 

In fact
_________

Iron Will: The Siege of Storm’s End
-
&gt; “I held Storm's End for him, took Dragonstone in his name.” – *ACOK, Prologue*

The second-born son of Lord Steffon Baratheon and Cassana Estermont, rebelled against the Iron Throne, Stannis reluctantly joined with the rebels. Robert tasked Stannis with holding Storm's End while he marched the majority of his forces west. When Robert was defeated at the Battle of Ashford by the Mace Tyrell (actually Randyll Tarly), it cleared Targaryen loyalist forces to move on Storm's End. The Tyrell army set up camp outside of the walls of Storm's End while the royal fleet led by Paxter Redwyne closed off Shipbreaker Bay.

A lesser leader would have capitulated; a lesser leader would have sought honorable terms for surrender, Stannis demonstrates two aspects of leadership that defined his character as a commander: **personal courage** and **loyalty**. He would suffer death before disobeying the orders that his brother had given him. 

**Aside**: More than a few people have asked why Stannis inspires such loyalty among his soldiers. I think the answer comes through the fact that he himself endured the same hardships as his soldiers. Oftentimes

Despite being cut off from the world, they continued to hold out against Mace Tyrell. 

Following the Battle of the Trident and the Sack of KL

It is not explicitly stated that Stannis knew how important his task was

Robert was unjust in crediting Ned for winning the battle. In fact

&gt; Stannis successfully holding the castle aided the rebellion as it meant the Tyrell host could not join Rhaegar Targaryen's army
_____________

Amphibious Assault: Dragonstone
-

After holding Storm's End for a year, he prepared to invade Dragonstone. 

Although we don't know much about the particulars of the battle itself, Davos III). This gave Stannis the best command and control of his forces - perhaps the single-most important tactical aspect of leadership. We also know that Stannis was successful in seizing the island fortress from the last Targaryen hold-outs. But amphibious assaults coupled with sieges are among the most dangerous and difficult tasks an army and navy can perform. His utilization of [joint warfare](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_warfare) was most likely key to winning the battle there. The fact that he was successful speaks volumes of his tactical adaptability as we do not have evidence he commanded a navy before. 

In fact

&gt;  ""I built a fleet at Robert’s command, brother, whatever should I do without you? No, he blamed me for letting Willem Darry steal away Viserys and the babe, as if I could have stopped it."" - *ACOK, Prologue*

Shaping Operations: Fair Isle and Great Wyk
-

&gt; In the end the Golden Storm went down off Fair Isle during Balon’s first rebellion, The Prophet*

[Map of Greyjoy Rebellion]( http://awoiaf.westeros.org/images/7/7a/Greyjoy_Rebellion.png)

Despite Robert and Stannis's differences

But the peace that Robert's Rebellion ushered in did not last for long. Six years following the end of Robert's Rebellion

&gt; [Why did Balon Greyjoy rebel the first time?]

&gt; Yes. Obviously Balon was wrong, might not have the strong support of the other lords the way that a Targaryen king would have. He also thought he could defeat Robert at sea. - [So Spake Martin, July 27, 2008](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Month/2008/07/)

The Greyjoys struck before Robert could assemble. Victarion Greyjoy and the Iron Fleet sailed into Lannisport and burned the Lannister fleet that was preparing to sail against the Greyjoys. This brazen surprise attack put the Iron Throne on defense. Ironborn raided the West and Rodrik Greyjoy laid siege to Seaguard. Basically

Stannis, Paxter Redwyne and sailed north on the Sunset Sea. Off the coast of Fair Isle, he laid a trap for Victarion Greyjoy. Here's how Victarion remembers it:

&gt; The memory of Fair Isle still rankled in the iron captain's memory. Stannis Baratheon had descended on the Iron Fleet from both north and south whilst they were trapped in the channel between the island and the mainland, Victarion I* - (I am indebted to /u/Ailite and /u/kidcoda for pointing me in the right direction and quoting the text respectively. Thanks to you both!)

Stannis's careful selection of the point where the Iron Fleet was decisive in destroying the Ironborn's greatest advantage: seapower. With Ironborn seapower destroyed

Stannis performed what is known as a [shaping operation](http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/call/thesaurus/toc.asp?id=33756). Army Field Manual 3.0 defines a shaping operation as:

&gt; An operation at any echelon that creates and preserves conditions for the success of the decisive operation. Shaping operations establish conditions for the decisive operation through effects on the enemy

The actions of Stannis and his fleet cleared the Sunset Sea of the Iron Fleet and allowed for Robert and Ned to ferry soldiers into Pyke for the main assault against the base of Greyjoy power. And while Robert took Pyke

1372786056.0,1hibqm,(Spoilers All) A Complete Analysis of Robb Stark as a Military Commander Pt 1,BryndenBFish,763,138,170,"&gt;""Battles, Chapter 14

First

- **Robb Stark was the greatest tactician during the War of the Five Kings.** 

and

- **Robb Stark was the worst strategist of the War of the Five Kings.** (Though Balon Grey gives Robb a run for his money for worst strategist.)

On the face of it, I will attempt to defend both of these statements with textual evidence and some non-technical references to military strategy. 

The Difference Between Tactics and Strategy
-

- **Strategy** - ""The employment of battles to gain the end of war."" - Clausewitz

- **Tactics** -  ""Tactics is the art and science of winning engagements and battles."" - *Marine Corps Doctrinal Publication - MCDP 1-3* 

Background
-
I'll keep this short as I'm sure most everyone here is familiar with the events in AGOT. Before he was King of the North, Robb Stark called his banners and proceeded to march south in an attempt to save his father. Along the way, he met up with his two most influential advisers: Ser Brynden ""The Blackfish"" Tully and his mother Catelyn Stark at Moat Cailin. There, Robb informed his mother that the Lannisters split their forces. One group of Lannisters led by Jaimie Lannister defeated Lord Clement Piper and Lord Vance at the Golden Tooth and then defeated Edmure Tully outside of the walls of Riverrun. The other force, led by Lord Tywin Lannister, secured Harrenhal and raced north to the Green Fork.

The Residue of Design
-
&gt; “Luck?"" Drizzt replied. ""Perhaps. But more often, *The Halfling's Gem*

Let's address one thing from the start. **Robb Stark was a lucky son of a bitch.** But this luck came as a result of careful planning and good division of responsibilities *initially.* Robb Stark divided his army between his cavalry and his infantry.  The infantry he sent to the Green Fork to engage Tywin

But, heavy infantry has the ability to set up a blocking position in good terrain. Heavy infantry, under competent leadership, could endure a beating by Tywin as well as slow any attempt Tywin could make to unify his forces if he caught wind of the ruse. As a former infantryman myself, I cringe at the thought of these poor grunts dying in a secondary effort, but I understand the cold calculus that went into the planning.  Preventing Tywin Lannister from unifying his two armies through sacrificing some of his infantry makes a lot of tactical sense. It was lucky that Tywin Lannister didn't perceive Robb's strategy, but it was a calculated risk that came through good planning and the correct course of action.

Preparation of the Battlefield: Whispering Wood
-

&gt; “They say he crossed at the Twins with the great part of his horse
A green boy, if he hadn’t hurt so much. - *AGOT, Chapter 62, Tyrion IX*

[Map of the Battle of the Whispering Woods](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/images/d/dc/Battle_of_the_Whispering_Wood.png)

While Roose Bolton and the 16, he sent Ser Brynden Tully and Theon Greyjoy ahead with his scouts. The scouts had two objectives: determining the disposition of Jaimie Lannister's host and killing enemy scouts/ravens who would alert Jaimie of Robb's approach. To this effect, the Blackfish's strategy worked. Jaimie Lannister had no idea of what was approaching Riverrun.

Robb sent a few hundred cavalry carrying Tully banners to lure Jamie Lannister into a confrontation. Jamie Lannister took the bait and attacked what he perceived to be another harrying force with a small cavalry force of his own. When he did, thus removing the head from the snake.  

Surprise
-

&gt; When a dam is broken

[Map of the Battle of the Camps](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/images/6/69/Battle_of_the_Camps.png)


In order to besiege Riverrun

To the north, commanded by Lord Brax attempted to take ships across the river to assist the north camp, but they were driven back by a flurry of stones from soldiers atop Riverrun's walls. Lord Brax was killed during the attempted crossing. When the soldiers from the west camp arrived back on the south short of the Tumblestones, they were suddenly set upon by Robb Stark, the Mallister and the Umbers. 

As a last stand, the Saxon shield wall nearly defeated the heavily armored Norman cavalry of William the Conqueror for example. The Lannister shield wall may have been effective against the Robb's attack but for one key element. The Lannisters seemingly did not count on the defenders from within Riverrun attacking their rear. The result was a complete annihilation of the Lannister west camp and north camp.

Planting the Seeds of Defeat through Victory
-

&gt; ""Roose has no feelings, The Prince of Winterfell (Reek IV)*

Upon seeing the destruction of 2/3 of the Lannister host, retreated in an orderly fashion. The result of the battles was an overwhelming victory for Robb Stark. Even with the losses suffered at the Green Fork, Robb Stark's host was now on something of a numerical par with Tywin Lannister's.

But in the midst of victory, it made the most sense. Roose was cold and cunning - the type of leader who would sacrifice his men for 'the greater good.' And yet the man was ruthless and worst of all, untrustworthy.

&gt; ""That man scares me."" - Robb Stark, Catelyn VIII*

Following the conclusion of the battles, he doesn't seem to provide any strategic guidance to the man who would eventually betray him, but I'll get to that in a future post...

There is a lot in common between Daenerys' walk through the plains and Vision Quests: 
* Daenarys was in the wilderness for quite a few days (2 - 3)

* The hallucinations Daenerys had could be construed as visions providing her with new purpose

This would indicate that Daenerys is not going insane or mad

If I did some digging, New Mexico, a city known for its museums on Native American history. I'm sure he got a lot of information.

At the end of ADWD, thus saving his spirit.  But what of Jon's body?

Those at the wall and north of it have grown to fear the fallen.  What is the ritual for the dead here?  A funeral pyre.

Jon Snow's body is likely going to be fed to the flames to avoid him returning as one of the Others.  His body will be burned.

But will it really?

**Here comes the tin foil**

Is it possible, that his body won't actual be consumed by the flame, but Jon Snow will in fact be reborn in the fire as AA?

It can be argued that Dany's situation was a special case

GRRM has stated that we will learn about Jon's parentage

1344435462.0,xvqua,(Spoilers and Speculation All) Petyr Baelish is a hero in is own mind,Jen_Snow,717,112,294,"I've seen variations of this theory about Littlefinger's motivation posted before but I wanted to talk specifically about my own twist on it. We got to talking a lot about this over in /r/asoiafreread yesterday because we just finished the chapter where Littlefinger betrays Ned. 

**Petyr Baelish isn't motivated by vengeance or a lust for power. His entire storyline happens because he's trying to save Catelyn from the Starks.** Everything else is secondary. 

From Sansa's chapter in the Eyrie at the end of Storm of Swords; Lysa talking:

&gt;“Be quiet, with her smiles and her dancing. You think I could forget? **That was the night I stole up to his bed to give him comfort. I bled, but it was the sweetest hurt. He told me he loved me then, *but he called me Cat*,** just before he fell back to sleep. Even so, I stayed with him until the sky began to lighten. Your mother did not deserve him. She would not even give him her favor to wear when he fought Brandon Stark. I would have given him my favor. I gave him everything. He is mine now. Not Catelyn’s and not yours.”^1

So

&gt;And as she watched

&gt;They met in the lower bailey of Riverrun. When Brandon saw that Petyr wore only helm and breastplate and mail, and so it was to him that she gave her token, a pale blue handscarf she had embroidered with the leaping trout of Riverrun. As she pressed it into his hand, she pleaded with him. “He is only a foolish boy, but I have loved him like a brother. It would grieve me to see him die.” And her betrothed looked at her with the cool grey eyes of a Stark and promised to spare the boy who loved her.

&gt;That fight was over almost as soon as it began. Brandon was a man grown, until the boy was staggering and bleeding from a dozen wounds. **“Yield!” he called, more than once, but Petyr would only shake his head and fight on, grimly.** When the river was lapping at their ankles, Brandon finally ended it, with a brutal backhand cut that bit through Petyr’s rings and leather into the soft flesh below the ribs

&gt;That was the last time she had seen his face…until the day she was brought before him in King’s Landing. A fortnight passed before Littlefinger was strong enough to leave Riverrun, and Littlefinger would not forgive that. As soon as he was strong enough to be moved, Lord Hoster Tully sent Petyr Baelish away in a closed litter, to finish his healing on the Fingers, upon the windswept jut of rock where he’d been born.^2

He fights and fights and fights but fails to save her.

Now here's Cat remembering LF as she's about to enter Kings Landing secretly to meet with Ned about the attempt on Bran's life.

&gt;He wrote to me at Riverrun after Brandon was killed

What did that letter say?? I'd bet any money that it said something along the lines of ""now that Brandon's gone

And just more proof that LF thinks he slept with Cat. Littlefinger has just picked Sansa up from Kings Landing and is taking her to the Fingers:

&gt;“The only game. The game of thrones.” He brushed back a strand of her hair. “You are old enough to know that your mother and I were more than friends. There was a time when Cat was all I wanted in this world. I dared to dream of the life we might make and the children she would give me...but she was a daughter of Riverrun, Honor, Sansa. Family, Duty, Honor meant I could never have her hand. **But she gave me something finer, a gift a woman can give but once.** How could I turn my back upon her daughter? In a better world, you might have been mine, sweetling. Dontos, and sailing home.”^4

We never see Littlefinger's reaction to the Red Wedding. I don't believe he was a part of it. Or

&gt;“So Lord Walder slew him under his own roof, but perhaps something went awry.”^5

After all

It creates an interesting parallel between Robert and Littlefinger. Robert goes to war to save Lyanna but she didn't need saving. Littlefinger rips apart the realm to save Cat but she too didn't need saving. I love that the hero trope is turned upside down.

He loves Sansa not just because she looks like Cat but because he was finally able to *save* her. He saved Sansa from the evil Joff and the marriage that she didn't want. Littlefinger is finally the hero that he thinks he is.

**TL;DR: Littlefinger isn't trying to succeed to punish the high lords who scoffed at him. He's trying to save the woman he loves and who he believes loved him in return. He's Prince Charming who has to save the damsel in distress. He fails to save Cat but finally succeeds in hero-ing with Sansa.**

Martin acknowledges his debt to Tolkien freely (you can read more about it [in this interview](http://www.adriasnews.com/2012/10/george-r-r-martin-interview.html?spref=tw)) 

One quote from this interview stood out to me in reference to what Martin does with Tolkien’s influence:
&gt;I read Tolkien when I was twelve or so and he impressed me a lot so I don’t get tired of rereading it. In fact, thing [sic] for which I am a little bit annoyed, more after getting noticed that Tolkien use [sic] to read almost every letter he received. But Tolkien wasn’t a direct influence to me when I decided to write A Song of Ice and Fire although my books are in the fantasy canon that Tolkien improved. I mean, fantasy is very ancient. We can find it in the Iliad or in the Gilgamesh Poem, but Tolkien turned it into a modern genre, and A Song of Ice and Fire shares some of these patterns but not all of them. For example, I pretend to offer a dirty fantasy

Although Martin claims to not be directly influenced by Tolkien, and his training under Haggon, a wildling skin-changer who takes Varamyr under his wing. To me, Varamyr is a “dirty … more raw” (Martin’s words) version of Tolkien’s Beorn. 

For those unfamiliar, sometimes he is a great strong black-haired man with huge arms and a great beard … some say that he is a bear descended from the great and ancient bears of the mountains that lived there before the giants came. Others say that he is a man descended from the first men” (Houghton Mifflin, 2003, p127). In ASOIAF, there is a connection between the ability to warg and lineage: only those with the blood of the [First Men can warg](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Warg).

Beorn has a retinue of animals, they awake to find the prints of many bears outside of Beorn’s house. The bear (beorn is Old English for “bear”) seems to be Beorn’s favored creature – the snow bear is Varamyr’s mount of choice, and Varamyr, too, has a retinue of animals: 3 wolves, a bear, and a shadow cat. Beorn sees himself as steward of the region and of animals. He hates goblins and Wargs, and he warms to Bilbo and the dwarves only once he verifies their account of doing battle with those hated creatures. (I haven’t quite figured out what to do with the differing uses of the word “warg” between Tolkien and Martin – maybe Martin is

After Haggon dies, p9). Varamyr describes it as “a hall of moss and mud and hewn logs” (9). Compare to Beorn’s house (both of which recall Anglo-Saxon halls): the main hall of Beorn’s “great wooden house” (127) contains a great, wooden table, around which Bilbo and company drink mead (139). Bilbo describes the pillars that support the roof as “like trees of the forest” (139). 

But whereas Beorn protects his region, and salt. He raped local women, and whenever some “village hero would come with a spear in hand,” he killed them (9). Varamyr reads as a petty, indulgent lord rather than the benevolent and protective Beorn. 

In this formulation, do not mate with other animals, do not enter a human). Varamyr, of course, rejects this teaching.

And then

In all, Varamyr is selfish and vain – he wishes to be a lord, a king, and he uses his warging abilities to achieve those ends.

**Castle Forged Steel** - A theory with large amounts of textual support and by all known literary devices a version of it should come to pass. e.g. AA and the PWWP are the same prophecy and at some point a hero/heroes will rise from amongst the ranks of characters to lead the defense of the world against the onslaught of the Others

**Plate Metal** - A generally accepted theory in the fandom with a fair amount of textual support. e.g. R+L=J

**Silk Doublet** - Something a bit crazier. Would subvert many tropes. In the grand scheme of things an unexpected outcome. e.g. Tommen will remain the king of Westeros 

**Tinfoil** - Completely left field idea. e.g. Stannis and Roose will set aside their differences and team up to defeat the Lannisters and Tyrells.

Re: House Martell Casting
I wasn't present for Pedro Pascal's audition, and to congratulate us on the casting. So I suspect that he will turn out to be a wonderful Red Viper.

I do know that David and Dan and HBO do favor having a racially and ethnically diverse cast on the series. It is true that we've lost several black characters who appear in the novels (Chataya and Alayaya, but to balance that, characters like Salladhor Saan and Xaro Xhoan Daxos, both white in the books, have been played by black actors. Missandei as well, though in the books the Naathi are golden-skinned, not white.

As for the Dornishmen, I've always pictured the ""salty Dornish"" as being more Mediterranean than African in appearance; Greek, Spanish, Italian, Portugese, etc. Dark hair and eyes, olive skin. Pedro Pascal is Chilean. (Check out Amok's version of the Red Viper

When and if the show introduces Prince Oberyn's daughters, ranging from Tyene (blond and blue-eyed) to Sarella (light brown skin, as her mother was a Summer Islander). And I expect that the crew of the CINNAMON WIND will all be cast with black actors... assuming, of course, that Sam's voyage remains in the story. """,,False,t5_2r2o9,True

We all know that Valyrian Steel has magical Properties, who attempts to forge a sword.

""Darkness lay over the world and a hero, Azor Ahai needed to forge a hero's sword. He labored for thirty days and thirty nights until it was done. However, when he went to temper it in water, the sword broke. He was not one to give up easily, so he started over. The second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better than the first. To temper it this time, he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart, with a heavy heart, Nissa Nissa

1. Using water

2. Using Blood of an animal creates a stronger sword

3. Using the Blood of a person

Throughout all of ASOIAF, you need to temper it in the blood of a person to give it magical properties.

This theory is still being researched


Edit: 

To clear a few things up.

Including the text above

Additional Speculative Information:
We know that the Valyrians captured slaves. Maybe they tempered the steel using the slaves. ""her soul combining with the steel of the sword"" of the legends implies she died and her soul went into the sword. So you cannot make Valyrian Steel by putting it into blood

Edit 2:

Maesters get Valyrian Steel chains when they master Magic. I think this tells us for certain that Valyrian Steel has magical properties and needs magic to forge it. All of the Red God's magic comes from blood sacrifice. (Mel burns people and uses leeches).

1355327581.0,14q9d4,(Spoilers all) Resolved: The series must end with a Stark king or queen,feldman10,725,151,726,"There's a surprising lack of consensus among readers about who will win the game of thrones at the end of the series. But here are some points:

* **6 of 8 planned POVs were Starks**: A little-known fact about ASOIAF is that, that means that he could envision the entire series being told from the eyes of Starks, Tyrion, and Dany. So though the number of POVs has expanded since then, for a while he envisioned the series as very much the story of the Starks.

* **The series begins** with the isolated, master the game of thrones, and win it. Not merely that they reappear to save the world from the Others and then go home to Winterfell -- that doesn't provide closure to the earlier thread of the Starks being chewed up by the game of thrones.

* **A Time for Wolves** was the original title of the final book. 

* **Winter Kings**: The series has built up that this winter will be unusually severe, and lead to a new line of Winter Kings who will lead Westeros through this hard time -- a time for wolves?

* **There must always be a Stark in Winterfell**: And that will be Rickon. Freeing a more important Stark to run things in the south.

* Edit: GRRM said the ending would be ""bittersweet."" This could entail the Starks becoming ""darker, but losing much of their essential honorable ~~Stark-ness~~ Ned-ness.

For the purposes of this thread, not a return to division and civil war, which is what 7 separate kingdoms would bring). So, considering that the only plausible Stark king or queens are Jon and Sansa, I feel pretty strongly that one of them has to be in power at the end of the series. But, I am not sure which one:

**Arguments against Jon**

* Duty to the Watch

* Might be busy fighting the Others

* Death and resurrection could ""change"" him and make him unsuitable for rule

* How will he convince everyone of R+L=J?

* Not clear who his queen would be if Dany ends up dying or being the antagonist

* Too magical?

**Arguments for Jon**

* Song of Ice and Fire

* R+L=J has been set up as the most important secret of the series from the very beginning

* Robb's will names Jon king in the North

* In ADWD Jon attempted to commit to the Watch fully
Ramsay

* ADWD seems to end with Jon breaking from the Watch

* We have spent a lot of time seeing Jon dealing with the day-to-day business of ruling. GRRM has said that he wishes Lord of the Rings spent more time on Aragorn learning day-to-day. 

* Could marry Dany

* The Wars of the Roses ended with the Lancasters/Targs and Baratheons/Yorks (I know the names match up better with Lannister and Stark

**Arguments against Sansa**

* She would almost certainly have to marry, making it somewhat less of a *Stark* victory.

* It's not clear who she would marry. Young Griff seems the best political choice

**Arguments for Sansa**

* She is currently learning the game of thrones from a master

* She is the Stark most likely to gain political support in the south in the near future. She could use the Vale's food stocks to help feed the starving continent in winter

* She would come full circle

* She is non-magical. I do feel that the series will end with magic receding from the world again. A Sansa win would be the triumph of practical politics

* What else is her ultimate purpose in the series?

1368469526.0,1e9c2o,(Spoilers all) Doubling down: The Talisa theory is wrong,feldman10,727,147,397,"For weeks [I've argued](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1b0ydh/spoiler_asos_one_of_the_more_interesting_theories/c92ni18) that the ""Talisa as Lannister spy"" theory is wrong, from ""certain tinfoil nonsense"" to ""probably tinfoil nonsense."" But I figured I'd restate my case and we'll see who's right in a few weeks:

**I. The plan is extremely implausible**

On pure grounds of plausibility, and the spy would hit the jackpot beyond Tywin's wildest dreams by landing Robb. This still relies on an enormous amount of luck though. 

The most generous way to define the theory focuses mainly on the letters. Yes, let's forget about the super-seduction plot and posit that Talisa has been sending letters to the Lannisters with information about Robb's camp, and could have had some hidden mission for them.

**II. But why would Talisa do this?**

If Talisa is who she claims to be -- a Volantene noblewoman -- I can't think of an explanation for why she'd be engaged in a dangerous spy mission on behalf of Tywin Lannister. Gold? Thrills? None of these explanations fit with the character we've seen

Now,"" which doesn't make any sense to me -- tell one army about another army's movements because of pacifism? Really there is nothing in Talisa's character that we've seen that could plausibly explain why she'd do this.

**III. Thematically it adds nothing to the show and arguably demeans it.**

People say that this twist would prove how brilliant Tywin is or how far he'd go. But there's *already* gonna be a mind-blowing reveal that Tywin orchestrated the betrayal and murder of the Starks and their men by Walder Frey and Roose Bolton. What would this added complication with Talisa add to this? (In actuality it would only show how lucky Tywin is

Now

&gt; COGMAN: Originally, Robb gets a terrible piece of news, and they spend the night together dealing with his grief, and he marries her after that. [In the show], it isn’t just about making an honest woman out of this girl, it’s that he falls in love and chooses love over duty, which is an ongoing choice which is brought up again and again throughout the series. Maester Aemon tells Jon Snow that love is the death of duty. And I think that was something that they really wanted to explore, and that we would see develop

The conflict between love and duty becomes far less interesting if the love is just a scam.

**IV. So what was the point of that scene?**

Simple: A last happy moment (and nude scene) of Robb and Talisa together before the tragedy. The pregnancy strengthens this interpretation. It's an added detail by the showrunners to heighten the tragedy when the true love couple of Robb and Talisa are murdered. Why was Talisa writing a letter? Because Robb went over to work on his battle plans and they had to give Talisa something of her own to do. Writing a letter is a better starting point for further dialogue then if she was just rearranging her first aid kit or something. Especially because invented languages aren't cheap and they want to get the most from that fancy new Valyrian.

   Here is a list of the things George has to tie up in two books:

 1)**The Lands of always Winter**: George mentioned we would end up here

 2)**Bran and the Gang**: Whats going to happen to them?

 3)**Blood Raven**: What is his end game? What is he going to do with Bran?

 4) **Coldhands**: Who? What? Seriously

 5) **Dead things in the water**: What ever happened to the wildlings near eastwatch?

 6)**The Wall**: Who is in charge now? Has it descended into chaos? Is Wun-Wun the wun in charge?

 7)**Jon ""Ceaser"" Snow**: Dead? Wolf? Zombie?

 8) **Melisandre**: See Bloodraven. What is her plan? Her motives?

 9) **Wildlings

 10) **Winterfel**l: How long will the Boltons hold out?

 11) **King beyond the the Wall**: How sorry should we feel for Mance and his lovely ladies? Were they responsible for every single one of the murders in Winterfell? 

 12) **The North remembers**: What are the loyal Stark bannermen (including Fats Manderly and the Umber crew) planning on doing about the Boltons? 

 13) **Onions and Unicorns**: What ever happened to lil Stark

 14) **The Mannis**: How is Stannis planing to win the Battle in the Snow?

 15) **Rhymes with Freak**: Will poor Theon find redemption or just be served with some Heart Tree justice?

 16)**Queen Asha**: Will Theons sister figure out a way to drag him back home again?

 17) **Iron Bank**: Stannis sent some dude across the narrow sea to get troops. I dont even remember his name. This will likely be important though.

 18) **Greywater watch**: People have been waiting since the Clinton administration for Howland Reed to come out of the swamps and start spreading some wisdom.

 19) **On the Road to Greywater Watch**: A certain bastard may be pretty upset that his brother didn't just send him a text after learning that the two Stark Bannermen charged with naming a new heir to the King in the North got lost in the swamps for 13 years (and counting)

 20) **Heh**: What is in store for the perps and captives of the Red Weddin? 

 21) **Sends his regards**: Is our favorite handsome, sister banging, kingslaying, smooth operating, recently reformed knight walking into a zombie trap? Yup.

 22) **Speaking of Zombies...**: What is the Ladies stonehearted plan? Does it involve Tom o Sevens and the Frey Wedding? What did she do to Brienne?

 23) **I wonder where that fish did go?** : Blackfish is missing. Will he attempt to rescue his nephew on the way to Casterly rock?

 24)**The ladder**: Will Littlefinger succeed in his plan to marry Sansa to Harry the Heir? 

 25) **The Mad Mouse**: Will this lil fella steal Sansa and take her back to Kings Landing?

 26) **The Bastard of the vale**: Will Sansa ever do something on her own volition beside play in the snow and brush her hair?

 27) **The lil Bastard of the Vale**: Will poor Sweet-Robbin just kick the bucket already?

 28)  **Ser Gendry**: Will THIS bastard ever do something to validate his inclusion in all of this?

 29) **Greyjoy vs. Greyjoy**:  Over on the Iron Islands its King Crows Eye the cunning and sinister magician against Damphair: the ex drunk who found purpose via medieval CPR techniques. Who will win? Knowing GRRM they both get eaten by a kraken a few chatpers into Winds.

 30) **Manderly and his Ships**: Did he say he was massing ships? I think he did...

 31) **Dragonstone**: What ever happened to poor Ser Loras?

 32) **The Rock**: GRRM mentioned that we will be seeing Casterly Rock for the first time in the next two books. My guess is that the Queen is going home. 

 33) **Kings Landing**: After Kevens run in with the little birds

 34) **The Faith**: These guys kind of came out of left field. What are they planning with their new military?

 35) **The Trials**: Two pretty ladies are in for some faith style fun

 36) **Qyburn**: What is this guys deal? See Coldhands. Seriously whats up with Qyburn?

 37) **Tyrell bannermen**: What are the Tyrells planning on doing with the large amounts men marching to Kings Landing?

 38) **Varys**: After Tywins Death, what is your deal?

 39)**Robert Strong**: I said before he was a Frankenstein style monster

 40) **Ser Bronn Blackwater, and just generally not giving a fuck. Typical Bronn. (As a side note, am I the only one who finds it funny that a sellsword ends up being named ""Blackwater""?) 

 41) **Tyrells need them ships**: How are the Tyrells dealing with those feisty Ironborn?

 42)**Intrigues in Oldtown**: What is Old Sam up to? What ever happened to that girl he liked? That kid? Something about a crazy magician/maester crossing the narrow sea to meet the Mother of Dragon? Some Dornish chick dressed like a dude is mixed up in all this too. Oh! not to mention...

 43) **Our Good Friend Pate

 44) **The golden company**: Refreshingly straight forward. Aegon Targaryen has landed and now he is conquering stuff in the Stormlands. Typical Targ... or IS he?

 45) **Ariannes sexcapades**: Doran Martell has sent forth his daughter to figure out the deal with the Targ invasion 2.0

 46) **YAR**: New pirate captain (pirate lord?)

 47) **The man with the plan**: Doran Martell is sitting on his ass bossing his family around as per usual. This time his plan has something to do with poor Balon Swann and schlepping him around Dorne.

 48) **Darkstar**: I am the night

 49) **Myrcella**: Poor thing is likely already traumatised for life; although knowing GRRM Myrcy is going to get lost on her way back north and run into a dude named ""Ramsey""

 50) **As the final Westeros plot point**: I should mention that Krakens were sighted off the coasts of Dorne. I dunno but to me that seems like a big deal. 
  Now for the plot points across the narrow sea.

 51)**BRAVOS!** : Our favourite little killer Arya is training to become a shape shifting assassin (psh

 52) **What ever happened to...**: This is an honest question. What ever happened to the crew of the ship Tyrion rode with Prince Aegon? We know what happened to Connington

  53)**The Imp**: Yup, which will decide the fate of little Penny, Brown Benn, and our favourite slave trading spy, Jorah Mormont. 

 54)**Meereen and the other free cities**: War is going down between the free cities

 55)**Daario**: Handsome fuck

 56) **Ser Grandfather**: Charged with the defence of a middle eastern style city across the sea from his homeland, and two dragons are on the loose around the city.

 57) **The various leaders of Meereen**: I don't even know their names. At this point I hope Drogan eats the lot of them.

 58)**The Iron Dummy**. Planning on making a grande aquatic entrance the battle of Meereen with his flame hand and dragon horn. Victarions entrance to the Slavers Bay story line is just gonna be so awesome. 

 59)**The Mother of Dragons**: When the sun rises in the west

 60) **AND FINALLY... Quaithe**: See Coldhands
 
Oh you thought we were done? How wrong you were. Here are the more general plot ideas not routed to one location.

 61)**Invasion of the Others**: All of westeros is in danger of being run over by evil

 62) **Prince that was promised, Dragon has three heads, etc**: Are all these prophesies ever going to amount to anything?

 63) **Gods

 64) **Dragons**: At some point

 65) **Knight of the laughing tree**: Who dat?

 66) **Promise me Ned**: Promise me you will never have an inner monologue which makes any of mine and your past clear. In fact

 67) **ASOIAF**: 17 years and counting, GRRM has not even given us this one.    

 And those are the plot points George has to cover within the next two books. So to finish up... What does everyone think the 8th book of ASOIAF will be called? The ninth? But seriously,,False,self,t5_2r2o9,1363241071.0,,True

Recently there has been a lot of discussion of names on this subreddit

 Names are vitally important in ASOIAF, everyone has certain perceptions about what kind of person a Stark is and that differs from their interpretation of a Frey. Bastard names are equally important, demonstrating instantly that the character is inherently an outsider. The name that Bastard's bear signifies them as being forever locked out of the inner sanctum of society, bastards can belong to a family but they can never truly be an integral part of that family (see Jon Snow who even though he was raised by Ned as essentialy a son remained an outsider in Winterfell)

No character is more obsessed with names, taking perverse pleasure in the pain he causes,  he also seeks to truly change Theon as a person, culminating in Theon being renamed as Reek. Theon is an extreme example and Ramsay takes extreme measures in his experiment, trying to erase all of who  Theon is as a person. And even after he is granted some freedom (and eventually escapes) Theon still continually flashes back to being forced to remember/repeat the name Ramsay bestowed onto him (Reek rhymes with). 

But why? Ramsay has been legitimized, for all intents and purposes he is Lord Bolton's heir and as long as he draws breath he will be Lord Bolton's only heir. So why does he so desperately want to learn how/if it is possible to change a name if his has already been changed? Because just because someone (even a king) writes something on a piece of paper does not make it so. Ramsay grew up dreaming of being legitimized, of being a real Bolton, then his dream came true and it's as though nothing changed. He is still not accepted, people still whisper about the ""Bastard's Boys"" (though not to his face obviously). He is still Ramsay Snow. No matter what else happens in his mind he will always be Ramsay Snow. All of his torture of Theon is designed to make Ramsay's dream come true, to truly change someone's name. If it can happen to Theon than maybe it can happy to Ramsay. The experiment is mildly successful but after Theon escapes it ultimately fails as he regains his sense of self and, ultimately his name. 

Why is this important? I don't know if it is, Jeyne story (all have adopted new names, Ramsay by choice, Theon against his will and Jeyne out of necessity) Ultimately I think it also has implication towards Jon Snow who, if the letter arrives from Rob or Stannis decided to, could have the Snow name dropped and will face similar problems. 

Ultimately I have one last thought, that way it cannot be turned against him. Ramsay never put that armor on, Snow covered Ramsay in another way and now that he's shaken it off it still holds onto his heart, telling him that he will never be what he wants to be. Ultimately, even more than Reek or his Father's indifference/cruelty   or any of a hundred other things Ramsay is defined by his always being Ramsay Snow. In this way, maybe this way alone, Ramsay is a tragic figure. 

tl;dr I believe that Ramsay will always be Ramsay Snow in his mind not Ramsay Bolton.",self,t5_2r2o9,False,,Baratheon,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/140dsr/spoilers_all_ramsay_snow_not_ramsay_bolton/
1353508195.0,13kena,(Spoilers All) Mormont's Raven,danNYtrack,666,99,159,"[A post from yesterday] (http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/13ib34/spoilers_all_bran_mormonts_raven_warging_and_time/) was discussing Mormont's raven. I stated that the raven is actually being warged by Bloodraven. I went to collect some quotes that might back up this theory and it got a little out of control so I decided to start a new post.

I understand that these quotes can be interpreted in a multitude of ways but this is the way that I read them.

If we go ahead and assume R+L=J (which is probably the safest of assumptions we can make) then we can see why Bloodraven would leed Jon through the raven. We *know* Bloodraven is a staunch Targaryen loyalist. He protected the dynasty from threats on multiple occasions and even slew his own brother to do so. As the last Greenseer it is quite possible that he is aware of Jon's Targaryen blood and therefore has a vested interest in Jon's fate. Also, at times the raven says words that were not spoken at all. I am also assuming that Bloodraven is determined to destroy the others. Keep these things in mind while reading through some of these quotes from the series and let me know what you all think or if you can add to this theory:


**Bloodraven talking to Bran:**

&gt;
*I’m trying
&gt;



**Bloodraven is excited that Bran will live:**

&gt;
Bran was going to live. “My brother is going to live, and whistled. The raven flew to his shoulder, crying, “Live! Live!”
&gt;



**Bloodraven knew it was foolish to send Royce as a lead Ranger:**

&gt;
The Royce boy was green as summer grass, so I yielded. I sent him out with two men I deemed as good as any in the Watch. More fool I.”
&gt;

&gt;
“Fool,” it called again. Doubtless old Mormont would take it amiss if he throttled the creature. A pity.
&gt;



**Bloodraven knows that fire kills wights:**

&gt;
Jon tried to shout, burn, burn!”
&gt;



**Taunting the word *father* to Jon can be taken as suspicious:**

&gt;
“Father
&gt;



**Bloodraven would obviously be disgusted about Joffery being on the throne:**

&gt;
“We have white shadows in the woods and unquiet dead stalking our halls
&gt;

&gt;
The raven laughed shrilly. “Boy, boy.”
&gt;


**About Longclaw which may be effective in battling the others:**

&gt;
“Take it, take it.”
&gt;



**Bloodraven was the LC of the Watch. He wants the Watch to remember its real purpose

&gt;
""...yet if the Night’s Watch does not remember
&gt;

&gt;
“Who will
&gt;



**Bloodraven knew Jon considered abandoning his oath to the Watch:**

&gt;
“Know
&gt;



**Bloodraven most likely knows of the coming war of the others:**

&gt;
Jon chewed his lip. The raven flapped its wings at him. “War, war,” it sang.
&gt;



**Bloodraven is possibly trying to make Jon question why his faster wanted him there/or Bloodraven himself is questioning why:**

&gt;
“Your lord father sent you to us
&gt;

&gt;
“Why? Why? Why?” the raven called.
&gt;



**Bloodraven knows that Craster *is* a slave of the others/and knows Craster's women are pretty much slaves to him:**

&gt;
The woman licked at thin lips. “This is our place. Craster keeps us safe. Better to die free than live a slave.”
&gt;

&gt; 
“Slave
&gt;


**Bloodraven again is reiterating that he knows of Craster's horrendous deeds:**

&gt;
“He gives his sons to the wood.”
&gt;

&gt;
A long silence. Then: “Yes.” And “Yes, yes, yes.”
&gt;



**This is directly before the slaughter at The Fist:**

&gt;
“Die, die, die.”
&gt;



**After Samwell informed Mormont that he got the messages out at the Fist:**

&gt;
“Good.” On Mormont’s shoulder his own raven echoed
&gt;



**Bloodraven telling Sam to hurry up and flee Craster's:**

&gt;
“Quick” the raven said. “Quick quick quick.”
&gt;



**Bloodraven choosing Jon for Lord Commander:**

&gt;
The kettle was in the corner by the hearth, seeking the rafters perhaps, or a window to make its escape, but there were no rafters in the vault, nor windows either. The raven  was trapped. Cawing loudly, it circled the hall, once, three times. And Jon heard Samwell Tarly shout
&gt;

&gt;
The raven landed on the table nearest Jon. “Snow,” it said again, “Snow, snow, snow.” It walked to the end of the table, spread its wings again, and flew to Jon’s shoulder.
&gt;



**Bloodraven possibly foreshadowing Jon's death (he screams death frequently):**

&gt;
“Dead, dead.”
&gt;



**Bloodraven telling Samwell to obey Jon's command to become a maester. It could be theorized that Bloodraven knows Samwell has a role to play in doing such:**

&gt;
“Obey.” Mormont's raven flapped its great black wings.
&gt;



**Bloodraven is constantly ""talking"" to Jon through the raven:**

&gt;
“Did you follow me as well?” Jon reached to shoo the bird away but ended up stroking its feathers. The raven cocked its eye at him. “Snow
&gt;



**On multiple occasions Jon awakens from prophetic dreams with the raven on his chest. It can be assumed that Bloodraven is influencing/speaking to him through these dreams:**

&gt;
...and woke with a  raven  pecking at his chest. “Snow
&gt;



**No explanation necessary:**

&gt;
He rose and dressed in darkness, and,  “King,” and, “Snow, Jon Snow, Jon Snow.” That was queer. The bird had never said his full name before
&gt;

1370921772.0,1g3hjz,(Spoilers All) Why we SHOULD worry about Stannis in the show,Stauncho,753,199,278,"I saw the post about why we shouldn't worry about Stannis in the show

One of the major themes of ASOIAF is that of identity. Discovering ones identity, a man who once had this admirable view of knights and ""the system"" and then was jaded by how he was treated by Aerys and then later Ned and the whole realm for branding him as dishonorable for the most honorable act he believes he did.  We saw it with Arya, as who she was slowly fades away into someone else, desperately trying to hold on to the last thing that makes her Arya Stark. We see it with Jon as he tries to make his own identity as a man of the Night's Watch and not just some bastard. We see it with Sansa, we see it with Tyrion, we see it Dany.

We also see it with Stannis. After the Blackwater, the Iron Throne.  He doubts Melisandre actually caused Robbs death or Balon's death.  He's doesn't believe 100% in Melisandre but he's cornered an isn't sure if he has another choice. 

But then, whether he has King's Landing or not. And as King, he has his duty. He doesn't wait to get confirmation of Rhllors power after Joff dies. No. He goes to the Wall because he is King and its his duty to protect the realm.  

It has nothing to do with Rhllor or Melisandre. It has to do with him and his rediscovery of himself and what he lost at the Blackwater. Doing his duty.

 Now, the show took that away from him.  Even if he does rediscover himself later, his impetus to go to the Wall now appears to be forced and now show Stannis cannot be the Mannis.

Emma Peel was a great choice as The Queen of Thorns, but you know he doesn't stand a chance against Margery... I absolutely love it. I like the simplification of the Willas/Sansa/Loras triangle too.

1358275160.0,16mqp1,(Spoilers All) Complete Guide to Westerosi Succession,galanix,607,66,230,"###SUCCESSION LAWS
  
##Andal Succession  

*A daughter before an uncle.*

It is the same as [male-preference cognatic primogeniture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male-preference_cognatic_primogeniture#Male-preference_cognatic_primogeniture). Pretty much all Houses with the exception of the Dornish and Targaryens follow Andal succession laws. In this form the eldest legitimate son inherits followed by that son's descendants. A daughter can inherit if she has no living legitimate brothers

##Targaryen Succession  

*An uncle before a daughter.*

This is a form of [agnatic primogeniture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male-preference_cognatic_primogeniture#Agnatic_primogeniture), even collaterally related males (i.e. uncles/brothers over daughters). It's not entirely clear how male-driven the Targaryen succession was, since they never had to look very far for a suitable male heir. It's likely a female could inherit if they were the last descendant of the patrilineal lines (male derived lines). For example, a more distant male relation from a female line (e.g. king's sister's son) wouldn't inherit over a daughter of a king, but a male relation from a male line (e.g. king's brother's son) would. (credit to /u/feldman10) The Targaryens at first followed Andal succession, but started following this form of succession following the [""Dance of the Dragons""](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dance_of_the_Dragons) when Rhaenyra and Aegon II (half-siblings) fought over their father's crown. 

##Dornish Succession  
It is essentially [absolute cognatic primogeniture or equal primogeniture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male-preference_cognatic_primogeniture#Absolute_cognatic_primogeniture). This makes no distinction between gender; it is the oldest legitimate child and his/her descendants that inherit.

##Bastards  
In any of the above laws of succession, including daughters and younger siblings (credit to /u/Axetronaut). Although this is not always the case and can be a point of contention and dispute. This is why Roose is convinced that Ramsay will kill any children Fat Walda has, because those children would be trueborn to Roose and thus come in line before Ramsay (ADWD 32: Reek III).

Typically only acknowledged bastards (i.e. ones welcomed into the father's house) are legitimized. Ramsay Snow, Edric Storm, Joy Hill, and the Sand Snakes are all examples of acknowledged bastards. People like Gendry and Mya Stone are unacknowledged bastards, so it is exceedingly unlikely they would be legitimized, as they would need proof of their lineage and they have none. Also, only a King can legitimize a bastard

##Exceptions  
These succession laws are not set in stone. They can be amended and circumvented so long as the sitting Lord desires it. For example

Another notable exception is the Iron Islanders' kingsmoot

##Multiple Titles  
A person can hold claim to multiple titles. For example, and Lord of Dragonstone. He is also next in line for Casterly Rock behind his mother. He could hold all four titles if he wanted to. Robert gave his Storm's End lordship to Renly by choice.

###SUCCESSION LINES OF NOTABLE HOUSES

**EDIT:** I've decided to include all people in the succession lines starting from the time of Robert's Rebellion.

* **bold**  - current head
* ~~strikethrough~~ - dead
* *italics* - unable to inherit for various reasons:
 1. bastard
 2. enemy of the crown
 3. taken vows
 4. missing or presumed dead

*Note:* Jon Snow/Stark assumes Jon is Ned's son. Jon Snow/Targaryen assumes R+L=J.

I can read it over and over again and still get frisson from witnessing Sansa's transformation and perhaps something supernatural going on in the background. 

##Power of snow:

&gt; She awoke all at once

The chapter opens with a dream Sansa has. Her body's nerves are atingle. Something woke her up. She would often have nightmares of her father's beheading but

&gt; but this dream had not been like that. Home. It was a dream of home.

Something has changed. She cannot fall asleep anymore. Then she realizes that it is snowing outside. Sansa wonders

&gt;   Snow was falling on the Eyrie.

&gt; Outside the flakes drifted down as soft and silent as memory. Was this what woke me? 

Sansa steps out and enjoys the snowfall. She associates the snow with innocence

&gt; Drifting snowflakes brushed her face as light as lover's kisses, she turned her face up to the sky and closed her eyes. She could feel the snow on her lashes, taste it on her lips. *It was the taste of Winterfell. The taste of innocence. The taste of dreams.*


Throughout the chapter snow has been giving strength to Sansa. When Lysa is trying to push her out of the moondoor

&gt;  She could feel snowflakes melting on her cheeks. Sansa flailed

Sansa even faints for no reason whatsoever.

&gt;  When Sansa opened her eyes again

Sansa is the very image of the old gods when her white face flushes red.

&gt;  but your face is flushed and you can scarcely breathe

There is ankle deep snow in the garden.

&gt; A pure world


&gt; Yet she stepped out all the same.

Sansa is associating pure with the snows and the North. 

## Sansa

&gt; She donned silken smallclothes and a linen shift, heavy leather gloves, and finally a *hooded cloak of soft white fox fur.*

Sansa is a direwolf but she is wearing a cloak of sheep. She has still to mature and hence wears lambswool. Foxes are associated with cunning and cleverness. She is clever now. She will become cunning when she matures.

&gt; At the center of the garden

This statue is of Alyssa Arryn whose family was all killed but it represents Sansa here. Sansa herself believes her family is all dead. The statue was broken during the trial by combat of Tyrion in GOT. The Lannisters couldn't bury her entirely. And the snow on the statue is giving Sansa strength.

##Winterfell

Snow giving Sansa strength is further demonstrated by Sansa's building of Winterfell with snow.

&gt; What do I want with snowballs? She looked at her sad little arsenal.

Arsenal is a loaded word to describe snowballs. Here they are associated with weapons. 

&gt; I could build a snow knight instead

Sansa's connection to the North is further strengthened when she discards the idea of making a knight but makes Winterfell instead. Snow has been giving her power so she channels it into making the castle. I believe the castle represents Sansa's identity

She will remain Ned Stark's daughter and will reject the identity of Littlefinger's daughter.

&gt; ""May I come into your castle


&gt; Sansa was wary. ""Don't break it. Be . . . ""


&gt; "" . . . gentle?"" 

This is a sexual innuendo. Littlefinger will try to bed Sansa in the future but Sansa will be wary. 

&gt; He smiled. ""Winterfell has withstood flercer enemies than me. It is Winterfell


&gt;""Yes

Littlefinger will fail in seducing her. In the previous Sansa chapter

&gt; Sansa stuck her fingers through the top, as the snow slid down under his collar. ""That was unchivalrously done, my lady.""


&gt; ""As was bringing me here


&gt; She wondered where this courage had come from

The Snow Winterfell is providing her courage. Littlefinger helped shape it but Sansa would become untrusting of Littlefinger in the future books and start questioning him. This will be the beginning of the end.

&gt; You must be very cold. Let me warm you


&gt; ""I won't.""

Refusal of marriage?

##Littlefinger

Littlefinger's family sigil is the titan of Braavos. Arya believes that the real Titan could step over the walls of Winterfell. 

&gt; he stepped over both walls with a single long stride

This sentence further strengthens the connection to him and the Titan. Sansa is associating Littlefinger with Marillion who tried to force himself on her.

&gt; He sounded almost like Marillion

She also believes that Lothor won't save her from Littlefinger and she must rescue herself. This is another rejection of southern chivalry.

&gt; Only this time Lothor Brune would not appear to save her; Ser Lothor was Petyr's man. ""You shouldn't kiss me. I might have been your own daughter . . . ""

The Ghost of High Heart has foretold that a maid will slay a savage giant near a snow castle. Sansa rips out Sweetrobin's doll out. This event seems to fulfill the prophecy but why would such an insignificant even be seen by the Ghost when she is seeing deaths of Kings? So

&gt; Swinging the doll by the legs


&gt; It was more than Sansa could stand. ""Robert, Robert had the legs and body, and the rag-and-sawdust stuffing was spilling in the snow.

This could point to a headless Littlefinger soon. 

Sansa also threw snow at him. Perhaps another hint to a beheading.

&gt;Petyr yelped

As all characters must pay the ironic price with their deaths

&gt; She wondered if Lord Robert would shake all through their wedding. At least Joffrey was sound of body. A mad rage seized hold of her. She picked up a broken branch and smashed the torn doll's head down on top of it

Sansa is upset at the prospect of marriage and there is the Gatehouse which again has sexual innuendo. Gatehouse Ami Frey was famous for allowing anyone to enter her castle. However

##Memories

&gt; It was the old days she hungered for. Prayed for.

Again the compass is pointing to the North.

&gt; She had last seen snow the day she'd left Winterfell. That was a lighter fall than this, and she'd ridden out with the snowflakes swirling around her

Childhood

&gt;  . She might even have caught her, but Sansa grabbed her leg and pulled her down and was rubbing snow in her hair when Jory came along and pulled them apart, laughing

Arya is hilarious. Sansa is not remembering any of the countless fights with her sister but a happy memory. She even mused Arya's hair with snow just like Jon! I miss Jory.

&gt; The snow fell and the castle rose.

I've always been fascinated by the interplay between ASOIAF and real-world myth and history. The way GRRM drew on everything from Hadrian's wall to Manichaeism in his world-building is great.

But he did. **There lived a man named John Stark (seriously)

John Stark was a highly successful and decorated leader in the American French &amp; Indian War (7 years

Here's the chronology of the major history-worth events from his life

* Just going to throw this one out there first: John Stark's most famous quotation was was an exhortation to his troops which famously ended with ""Death is not the worst of evils"". Totally not applicable to ASOIAF

* He was born in the very northernmost area of his country, moved further north, to the absolute last area before the true wilderness. Wilderness famous for its harsh winters, virgin forests, and the hereditary enemies (the Indians &amp; Quebecois)of all Stark's people (English) who lived there. Small scalle border warfare was constant. 

* He joined a military group called 'Robert's *Rangers*', and conducting long-range reconissance missions and raids in the wilderness. He rose to become the company's XO while still a young man.  

*  While in the wilderness, after an impressive feat of arms, won their respect, was spared punishment, and was made a member of their tribe. He returned to his frontier home, however. The Rangers would later fight the tribe who had captured him. 

* Full-scale war would break out. Therein

* After the war

* Which was ok, Stark raised an army of the frontier people, and rode to assist those assaulting it. 

Ok, son of a Stark did.* 

I now really

And for what its worth

* Save those assaulting the capital

* Then joined forces with the assaulting army

* After that, settled down on the northern frontier, played no role in politics, and died old, safe and happy (a rarity there/then).

Melisandre mentions ""waking the dragon"" under Winterfell and since we know her visions aren't completely accurate, like magma just under the surface. If my knowledge of science is correct (it is highly likely it isn't), then the Obsidian is formed when lava is cooled quickly (when it hits water). That's why it makes sense that Dragonstone (an island likely formed from volcano) has large deposits of the stuff. 

The deposits of Dragonglass in Winterfell would explain how the Children of the Forest had access to Dragonglass to give to the NW

Stannis, the men in the North would be able to use the Dragonglass to protect themselves.

1371488244.0,1giwte,(Spoilers All) The Last ~130 years of Stark Lords Explained,historyofwesteros,623,104,110,"Hello all.  It's past time that the History of Westeros podcast had a presence here on Reddit.  But we shan't resort to a simple ""hey

Starting with the Stark statues in the crypts and using scattered details from the books (including unreleased material)

From the text, Lord Willam and his brother Artos the Implacable, Lord Donner, Lord Beron, Lord Rodwell, one-eyed Lord Jonnel, Lord Barth, and Lord Cregan who fought Aemon the Dragonknight""

Given the reference to Aemon at the end of the passage, we have a solid foundation for the assumption that Bran's ordering is chronological.

We start with Lord Cregan, based on content and number of mentions in the books, was likely one of the best ever. He fought in the Dornish Conquest, likely facing some of Dorne's best.  Interestingly, there is no reason to suggest Cregan ever fought Aemon in earnest.  Why would House Stark have fought House Targaryen during that time period?  The Dance of the Dragons was over before Aemon was born and the Blackfyre Rebellions began well after he died (and we don't even know whose side the Starks fought on in those wars, if any).  Unless there was another split or succession struggle, (certainly possible but suspiciously missing in reference if so), Aemon likely wouldn't have participated, at a tourney celebrating Aemon’s *father* Viserys II's ascension. In a melee

More: we know that the Skagosi rebelled ""about 100 years ago"" so roughly around AL 200.  We know that a Lord Stark died during this rebellion

We know, which we know to be ~210-213.  We know that Lord Beron Stark was gathering swords to drive the Ironmen back (Dunk wants to gain employment there).  If the order is correct, Beron is the 4th of the 5 who die.  We know that a Lord Stark is dying when Dunk is actually arriving, so that would be Donner.

Following that in order we have the 3rd short termer as Lord Rodwell, but it seems unlikely that it would kill all 3.  So perhaps Rodwell also died to Dagon, and perhaps all 5 of them!

Jonnel One-Eye is unlikely to have been Lord for long.  He is sandwiched in-between Barth who

So the ""range"" on Stark Lords dying to the Great Spring Sickness is 0-2. 

This means Dagon is put down while Willam is Lord.  btw, however.  Other Starks may have been rare however, due to the apparent devastation caused by Dagon and the Sickness.  We'll call Artos as the direct ancestor ""moderately likely"".


**The Eleven Prior to Lord Eddard**

Cregan Stark - became Lord 171 or earlier and died no later than ~198 (we know his reign was ""long"" from a World of Ice and Fire fragment)

Brandon Stark - became Lord after Cregan's long reign

Barth Stark - ~200 until dying ""recently"" from the perspective of people living ~212  Likely killed by the Great Spring Sickness or Dagon's Rebellion

Jonnel Stark One-Eye - became Lord and likely died soon after

Rodwell Stark - became Lord and likely died soon after

Beron Stark - ~212 became Lord and likely died within a year

Donner Stark - ~212 became Lord and died to Dagon's Rebellion

Willam Stark - ~213 became Lord

Artos the Implacable became Lord Stark upon the battlefield death of his brother Willam

Edwyle Stark - became Lord after Artos died

Rickard Stark - became Lord ~272?

The RPG claims the war against Raymun Redbeard was ~184 but this is disproven both by Jon's chapter which states that Raymun was around during the time of his grandfather's grandfather and by some of the non-assumptive parts of this post.  If ""grandfather's grandfather"" is taken literally that means Artos is an extremely strong candidate to be Jon's grandfather, or a cousin.

This also goes a long way towards explaining why the Starks are not so numerous.  In addition to all the Stark Lords who died

We first encounter Brienne as a member of Renly Baratheon's Kingsguard. In her own way, my lady, he was so good, he...” ACOK 39/Catelyn V). Like Sansa, Brienne has a tendency to confuse surface for substance.

And like Littlefinger warned Sansa

&gt;“...it will not last, and winter is coming.”

&gt;“Lady Catelyn, and it’s always summer in the songs. In the songs all knights are gallant, all maids are beautiful, and the sun is always shining.”

&gt;Winter comes for all of us, child, and sooner than you like. She did not have the heart to say it. (ACOK 22/Catelyn II)

As Catelyn predicted, she reflects on Catelyn's warning:

&gt;[Ser Hyle Hunt] “Ben died

&gt;Good, the two of them making faces at each other. What was it Catelyn Stark had called them...? The knights of summer. And now it was autumn and they were falling like leaves...(AFFC 14/Brienne III)

Like Sansa, young, gallant), but Sandor Clegane (ugly, old, disgraced, discourteous) eventually came to dominate her thoughts and fantasies much more than Loras. For Brienne

For Brienne

&gt;Would that Jaime had come with me, it was Renly that she wanted. I swore I would protect him, and I failed. Then I swore I would avenge him, and I failed at that as well (AFFC 20/Brienne IV)

Brienne has also had two dreams in which Renly actually turns into Jaime. The first:

&gt;That night she dreamed herself in Renly’s tent again...Something was moving through green darkness...hurtling toward her king. She wanted to protect him...when the shadow sword sliced through the green steel gorget and the blood began to flow

The second (Please note the reference to [roses](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1dmz7p/spoilers_all_brienne_and_jaime_an_indepth/)

&gt;Loras Tyrell had been the last to face her wroth that day. He’d never courted her...but he bore three golden roses on his shield that day

So why does Jaime start replacing Renly in Brienne's mind?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
**II. Honor among Kingslayers**

While they were traveling together

&gt;“I will find the girl and keep her safe

Jaime, He described Brienne's quest as his last chance for redemption:

&gt;“I have made kings and unmade them. Sansa Stark is my last chance for honor.” Jaime smiled thinly. “Besides

Their destinies are intertwined. Like Jaime, her reputation is undeserved. Like Jaime, Brienne swore an oath to find Sansa Stark. And like Jaime, Brienne considers her oath to Catelyn a chance to redeem herself for failing in her duty as kingsguard. 

To be clear

&gt;“Your oaths are worthless. You swore an oath to Aerys.”

&gt;“You haven’t cooked anyone in their armor so far as I know (ASOS 21/Jaime III)

.

&gt;“The Kingslayer

Jaime feels guilty about having failed to protect Rhaegar's wife and children who were innocents (I'll discuss this more later). *That* was the true violation of his oath as kingsguard. Finding Sansa

&gt;[Brienne] held [Oathkeeper] and said a silent prayer to the Crone, light the way before me, show me the path that leads to Sansa. She had failed Renly, had failed Lady Catelyn. She must not fail Jaime. He trusted me with his sword. He trusted me with his honor. (AFFC 4/Brienne I)

But Brienne's quest to find Sansa is not only motivated by the desire to redeem herself for failing Renly. Her chapters in AFFC demonstrate that she very strongly connects her quest with redeeming Jaime's honor. She has a fever dream that is quite revealing:

&gt;She could not fight without her magic sword. Ser Jaime had given it to her. The thought of failing him as she had failed Lord Renly made her want to weep. “My sword. Please

She may not even been lying when she says ""my God provides me the nourishment I need"". She would have been revived by R'hollor magic, so from a certain point of view, that would fit.

She is also implied to be very old, besides this:in what works of fiction do the undead age?

She also seems to struggler recalling her life before she became Mel

She doesn't get cold at the wall

Now, which wights aren't supposed to do. But, if she is undead, she is certainally of the R'hollor type, so I think that could explain that. And the fact that she never mentions being undead, perhaps she might not even know.

1358887425.0,172rbe,[Spoilers All] Physical and Mental Illness in ASOIAF,saskatch,556,63,255,"Here is my attempt at medically diagnosing the characters in ASOIAF. This has probably already been discussed in detail

I know I'm overanalyzing these characters, or ""literary"" diseases. There isn't really any point to this thread, I just thought it might provide insight into some of the characters. I have no background or knowledge in medicine or psychology, so take everything I say with a grain of salt and offer your own opinion.

**Characters:**

* Hodor - Hodor is usually referred to as 'simple minded, who had progressive loss of speech and paralysis but not a loss of comprehension nor mental function. He was nicknamed ""Tan"" due to his inability to clearly speak any words other than ""tan."" Also, I'm pretty sure the creators of the TV show know that Hodor has a lesion on his brain, because they gave him a scar on the front right part of his head, which you can see in [this picture](http://stuffpoint.com/game-of-thrones/image/18921-game-of-thrones-kristian-nairn-hodor.jpg). So even though we don't hear the story of how Hodor was injured, we can assume he suffered head trauma as an infant.

* Gregor Clegane - Judging by his enormous size and anger issues, and suffered from debilitating head pain, which is also a known symptom of acromegaly.

* Joffrey Baratheon - I believe the medical term that best describes Joffrey is ""a little shit."" He is seemingly incapable of empathy, because he perfectly fits the profile of a [sociopath](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisocial_personality_disorder): superficial charm, manipulativeness, egotism, lying, lack of remorse and empathy, poor impulse control and other behavioral problems. Some of his issues could possibly be attributed to his incestuous genetics. Cersei also seems to fit this profile pretty well, manipulative bitch.

* Mad King Aerys / The Targaryens - After the Defiance of Duskendale, cruel, and prone to furious outbursts. He may have suffered from any number of mental illnesses, which he (and other Targaryens) could be predisposed to due to inbreeding. His craziness could have been caused by [dementia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia), paranoid schizophrenia, or something else. Though we don't hear a lot about STD's in Westeros, his mental degradation matches the symptoms of [syphilis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syphilis) (the pox?), which is a blood disease that affects the nervous system

* Lysa Tully - Throughout the books

* Robert Arryn - We know that Robin is afflicted with frequent seizures and is constantly bled by his maester. His disease is referred to as the 'shaking sickness

* Sansa - Sansa's behavior in the first couple of books is likely attributed to the psychological trauma of having her father and dire wolf killed

* Tyrion - Obviously, Tyrion is clearly capable and intelligent, but could be described as having an addictive personality.

* Maester Aemon - If I remember correctly, fever, and difficulty breathing, brought on by the cold climate.

* Gyles Rosby - Rosby is constantly coughing blood into a handkerchief, or [chronic bronchitis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_bronchitis).

* Ramsay Bolton - Ramsay is fucked in the head. His obsession with mutilation could fuel speculation about [psychosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosis) or psychopathy

* Reek - The original Reek, a metabolic disorder that causes a defect in the production of a certain enzyme, causing a strong fishy odor to be released in sweat, urine, and breath. Or, like everyone says, maybe he has just never taken a bath.

* Theon Greyjoy - Theon may have suffered from [manic depressive disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) due to his experience being captured and warding for the Starks. After his capture by Ramsay, sometimes to the point of defending his actions.

* Manderly and Illyrio - These guys suffer from obesity

* Hoster Tully - Hoster probably just died of old age

* Khal Drogo - Drogo died from a 'festered wound' which is simply the equivalent to [septicemia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis).

* Rhaego - According to Mirri Maz Duur, and had innards full of graveworms. She also says that when she touched him, his skin fell away from his bones. According to Mirri Maz Duur, the deformity had a magical explanation, but his description matches that of a baby born with [harlequin ichthyosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlequin-type_ichthyosis) (kind of NSFL), a congenital skin disease that causes scaly skin, and cranial deformities.

**Various Diseases:**

* Greyscale - When greyscale infects children, Greyscale seems to have elements of [leprosy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy) and possibly congenital [ichthyosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthyosis).

* The Grey Plague - So far

* Redspots - Redspots is diagnosed by little spots on the skin

* The Pox - The pox is described as some sort of sexually transmitted disease. In the books

* The Bloody Flux - The bloody flux, and diarrhea. The only known treatment in the books is quarantine, and it is mentioned as being able to kill three out of four men in armies. The bloody flux is definitely [dysentery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysentery), which was actually historically known as the bloody flux.

* Greywater fever - In the books, there isn't a lot to go off of, so I'll just go out on a limb and say that it's [Typhoid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoid_fever) fever.

* Great Spring Sickness - The Great Spring Sickness was a mysterious plague epidemic that killed tens of thousands of people, and Oldtown. Again, we don't hear much about the specifics of the disease, and I haven't read Dunk &amp; Egg yet, so I don't know what  to say about this one. Any ideas?

I'm recapping all the mentions of the prophecy in this section

&gt;“**To go north, and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow.**”  
*Asshai*
“Truth

^(ACOK 40: DAENERYS III)

Dany hears the prophecy again (verbatim) while on-board *Balerion* docked outside Astapor

Quaithe appears to Dany once more in Meereen on her terrace. She presents her longer prophecy first (i.e. pale mare, etc.), but afterwards the original prophecy is referenced once more:

&gt;“If you have some warning for me
Moonlight shone in the woman’s eyes. “To show you the way.”  
“I remember the way. **I go north to go south, but here I am a queen. I command you—”  
“*Daenerys*. Remember the Undying. Remember who you are.”

^(ADWD 11: DAENERYS II)

I don't think it's significant

***
###THE GEOGRAPHIC INTERPRETATION
The most common interpretation of this prophecy is that people think Dany is going to go southeast to get to the northwest (Westeros)

[Let's look at a map of their known world to get a sense of where Asshai is (official map preview from *The Lands of Ice and Fire*).](http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2013/060/8/a/world_of_ice_and_fire_by_torstan-d5wmiv7.jpg)

Asshai is located at the tip of the peninsula at the bottom-right and the Shadow Lands are the purplish mountain region directly northeast of it on the peninsula. So taking that route would fill many of the requirements of the prophecy

However

&gt;Only in flasback and memory

[^(So Spake Martin: July 27

Considering the lengthy journey east and Asshai's location at the opening to the strait, pre-ADWD). So this interpretation is *highly* unlikely.

I have heard other various geographic interpretations of the prophecy which involve locations on Westeros. Like to get to the Wall (north) she must first go to Dorne (south). A lot of things along those lines

***
###THE DANY-X INTERPRETATION
As far as I know I'm the first person to have this specific interpretation of the prophecy so I'm coining it the 'Dany-X Interpretation' as it has to do with Dany's tenth ADWD chapter. As I said in the first section there is one last mention of the prophecy

&gt;“**To go north, you must go back. To touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow.**”  
“Quaithe?” Dany called. “Where are you
Then she saw. *Her mask is made of starlight.*  
“Remember who you are

^(ADWD 71: DAENERYS X)

And wouldn't you know it almost all of the prophecy occurs either figuratively or literally (sometimes both) in this very chapter. The remaining quotes are all from this chapter.

##TO REACH THE NORTHWEST...
The northwest for the prophecy represents Westeros

##YOU MUST JOURNEY SOUTHEAST.
She begins the chapter in Drogon's lair which she is calling Dragonstone. She wants to get back to Meereen and so looks for a stream in hopes that it leads to the Skahazadhan

&gt;The stream was trickling **south by southeast**, and I will do the rest.*

##YOU MUST PASS BENEATH THE SHADOW...
The shadow represents either Drogon himself (given his dark coloring) or the literal shadow he casts:

&gt;The second time he passed before the sun, so close she could hear the sound of his wings. For half a heartbeat Dany thought that he was hunting her, but he flew on without taking any notice of her and vanished somewhere in the east. Just as well, she thought.

Here Dany literally passes beneath Drogon's shadow. In a figurative sense, etc.).

##TO TOUCH THE LIGHT.
The light is represented by the sky; the sunlight and starlight in the sky to be more precise. When she hears the prophecy in this chapter and looks for Quaithe

&gt;“Where are you
*Then she saw. Her mask is made of starlight.*  

There is another mention of the Sun and stars a few paragraphs later:

&gt;The sun was only just coming up. A few bright stars lingered in the cobalt sky. *Perhaps one of them is Khal Drogo

The sky is the light

&gt;She kicked him, the way the scout had gone. Drogon went willingly enough; perhaps he smelled the rider’s fear.

##TO GO FORWARD

This line actually has two meanings. The first meaning is a directional one that Dany directly references in the chapter:

&gt;Dany leapt onto his back. She stank of blood and sweat and fear

She is heading due south along the stream at this point and decides to go after the Dothraki scout due north. Thus she is going back to kill the scout

The other meaning behind the line is looking at 'forward' and 'back' in a temporal sense. The Dothraki and Jhaqo are experiences that are very much behind her at this point. But in order to go forward on her journey she must go back and revisit the Dothraki as she does at the end of this chapter.

It also represents Dany going against her previous instincts. A line that Dany oft repeats is ""*If I look back I am lost*"". She says it twice this chapter, to Braavos with Willem Darry, to Pentos with Illyrio, to the Dothraki, to Qarth, to Astapor, to Yunkai, and to Dragonstone (Drogon's lair

##CONCLUSION/TL;DR

So here is a concise summary of the prophecy as I interpret it:

|PROPHECY|INTERPRETATION
|:-|:-
|To go north [&amp;] reach the west|To reach Westeros and achieve your goals
|you must journey south [&amp;] go east|you must follow the stream southeast.
|To go forward
|To touch the light|To learn to fly your dragon
|you must pass beneath the shadow|you must earn Drogon's trust and pass his trials.

This is fitting with the comments surrounding the prophecy as well. Quaithe says she wants to 'show Dany the way'. She also mentions that Dany needs to 'remember who she is' (the Mother of Dragons) and that 'the dragons know' who she is. It all fits with the prophecy being about Dany learning to ride her dragon and revisiting her Dothraki past in order to reach Westeros. This could also be linked to the [Stallion Who Mounts the World](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Stallion_Who_Mounts_the_World) prophecy

1374110114.0,1ij093,(Spoilers All) Jaime Lannister and the Philosophy of Ethics,Lord_Varys,570,91,110,"A Song of Ice and Fire is great for so many reasons.  One of those factors

Another factor contributing to Martin’s legend is the commentary that the novels provide on morality and ethics.  We get an exploration of the area between “morally black” and “morally white” in the hearts and souls of every character.  Can anything else really be said about Martin’s masterful navigation of “the grey area”?

Well

A sublime collision of both factors takes place in the character arc of Jaime Lannister.  Yes, history, and exploration.

But that’s only part of it.

**Jaime Lannister, perhaps) on two of the most prevalent ethical theories that exist today – Utilitarianism and Kantianism.**

--------------

Some background to get you started (definitions pulled from Wikipedia):

- **Utilitarianism:** A theory in normative ethics holding that the proper course of action is the one that maximizes utility

- **Kantianism:**  An ethical theory holding that actions are to be performed in accordance with some underlying maxim or principle

**In short

To a Utilitarian

&gt;*”Explain to me why it is more noble to kill 10

This is the man who engineered the Red Wedding, heartbreaking moment any writer has ever penned, but can’t you see things from Tywin’s perspective?  Is there not some validity to the point he’s trying to make?

The end cannot justify the means to a pure Kantian.  Davos

&gt;*”What is the life of one bastard boy against a kingdom?”*

&gt;*”**Everything.**”*

A Kingdom won without honor is not worth winning.  Note that in Kantianism, Stannis might have been able to end the war, saving countless innocent lives, by sacrificing Edric.  But by treating Edric as a *means* to that end, you violate the categorical imperative.

---------------

Jaime Lannister had always been, Tywin, and his experiences demanded it.  It started with the killing of the Mad King.  Jaime broke his holy vows to save tens of thousands of lives.  

As a Knight of the Kingsguard, to execute the King’s orders.  Serve.  Obey.  Protect.  Recall that Barristan comments on how he has done things he was ashamed of, but it was his *duty* to obey a King, even if that King was evil.  What we see here is an *extreme* case which pushes the boundaries of ethical thought to their furthest limits.  Still, he violates this duty so that he might minimize suffering for the greatest number of people.  Let me stress that this is obviously an incredibly difficult situation that would likely break the resolve of even the most devoted Kantian.  It is almost a traumatic experience that altered his decision making for the rest of his life.

Accordingly, his attempted murder of Bran is another *perfect* example of valuing the ends with little account for the means.  “If I push this boy out of the window, how many thousands of lives will I save?”  There is a risk that his secret could be exposed, and if that happens, how many countless lives will be lost in the ensuing war?  Honorable Ned and righteous Stannis will not accept Joffrey.  Should Bran say anything, it could mean a war for the throne.  *What is the life of one innocent boy against a kingdom?*  Nothing, to Jaime

But Jaime changes.  Between Riverun and King’s Landing, he finally takes his stand.  He realizes his “Categorical Imperative”.

He stops Cersei.  He is the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard

Not only does he recommit to his duty, the ultimate symbol of innocent life in this story, to safety.  We have not seen much of the new Jaime as of yet, but we know that in rejecting his sister completely and coming to terms with his role as Lord Commander, he has thrown his old life away.  He is committed to a new kind of honor.  He is committed to his categorical imperative.

---------

The most difficult moral questions in these books tend to revolve around how a character acts when an innocent life is in their hands.  Davos, “good”, or “virtuous” characters in the book, and it is largely due to the way they treat innocent life (Edric; Daenerys, Cersei’s children, and his own; the old man in the Gift, respectively).  Tywin and Roose tend to be considered evil, and in fact seem to try to minimize the total number of lives lost to a prolonged war.  Does this mean “Kantianism = Good, and Tommen) enabled the war.  Davos’ smuggling of Edric prolonged it.  Jon’s insistence on fortifying Hardhome and allowing thousands of useless Wildlings pass through the Wall (granted

What I see in Jaime Lannister is a battle between two of these competing ethical philosophies.  I see a man struggling with one of the great philosophical debates of our time.  Do we sacrifice rights to privacy if it means saving lives from terrorism?  Do we permit people to smoke cigarettes even though it will cost lives and money?  *Do the ends justify the means?*

While our opinion of him as a character changes, we start to like him more, and even if he never lost his hand, the revelation of why he killed Aerys would have contributed to the evolution of him as a character.  It’s not just that our opinion of him changes, he himself changes.   Both of those transformations *just happen* to occur at the same time, but they build on each other, and are separate.  What I see in him is a transition from Utilitarianism to Kantianism.  I see a compelling

**III. Swords and Roses**

&gt;She dreamt she was at Harrenhal, gnashing his filed teeth together. Brienne fled from him. “My sword,” she called. “Oathkeeper. Please.” The watchers did not answer. Renly was there, with Nimble Dick and Catelyn Stark. Shagwell, Pyg, and Timeon had come, and the corpses from the trees...Brienne wailed in horror at the sight of them,” she heard herself scream

&gt;...Then she was back at the Whispers...and facing Clarence Crabb...Crabb’s teeth had been filed into points. When Brienne went to draw her sword, I have to find my sword.” (AFFC 42/Brienne VIII)

Brienne's fever dreams after her fight with Rorge and Biter signal how important redeeming Jaime's honor has become to her. But her dedication to this quest is not as straightforward as it appears. Nor is her anxiety about losing Oathkeeper. In the following passage

&gt;...“He will bring a rose for you, a rose could not keep her safe. It was a sword she wanted. Oathkeeper. I have to find the girl. I have to find his honor. (AFFC 42/Brienne VIII)

Swords will keep Brienne safe

&gt;Ser Ronnet was a landed knight

&gt;“Why

Years later

&gt;She remembered a day at Evenfall, tightly laced into a stiff new gown, its bodice bright with garnets. The two of them were of a height, but she could not look him in the eye, nor say the simple words her septa had taught her. Ser Ronnet. I welcome you to my lord father’s hall. It is good to look upon your face at last. (AFFC 9 /Brienne II)

Humiliation frightens Brienne more than injury or even death. What makes her well-equipped to face the latter (her size and strength) are precisely what make her vulnerable to the former:

&gt;Her father welcomed [Renly] with a feast and commanded her to attend; elsewise she would have hidden in her room like some wounded beast. She had been no older than Sansa, they will laugh at me. But the Evenstar would not relent. (AFFC 4/Brienne I)

She relived the humiliating experience with Ser Ronnet in Renly's camp when his knights competed in a cruel competition to win her maidenhead. Sadly

&gt;In the mêlée at Bitterbridge she had sought out her suitors and battered them one by one, the Mother had delivered Connington to her. This time Ser Ronnet held a sword and not a rose. Every blow she dealt him was sweeter than a kiss. (AFFC 20/Brienne IV)

One reason she beat Loras Tyrell in the mêlée was because of the device on his shield. It's also possible Brienne resented Loras

&gt;Loras Tyrell had been the last to face her wroth that day. He’d never courted her...but he bore three golden roses on his shield that day

For Brienne, but Jaime gave her an even better one:

&gt;Renly’s sword. It still hurt

&gt;But she had another longsword hidden in her bedroll. She sat on the bed and took it out....When she slid Oathkeeper from the ornate scabbard

Many have described the adventures of Brienne and Jaime as a road trip/buddy movie. But [certain romantic comedy tropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension) are also evident in their story. They are an odd couple who have been forced together by unusual circumstances. They constantly bicker, like kisses and dancing (also keep in mind what else Jaime's sword might represent):

&gt;“Give me the sword

&gt;“Oh, parrying, but he followed, pressing the attack. No sooner did she turn one cut than the next was upon her. The swords kissed and sprang apart and kissed again. Jaime’s blood was singing...

&gt;The dance went on. He pinned her against an oak, steel screamed and sparked and scraped, and the woman started grunting like a sow at every crash, yet somehow he could not reach her.

&gt;[Jaime]  laughed a ragged, my sweetling, the music’s still playing. Might I have this dance, my lady?”

Jaime even symbolically takes Brienne's virginity during this 'dance':

&gt;...As he felt himself falling

GRRM has used ""red flower"" to refer to menstruation (ACOK 57/Sansa V) so it's not a stretch to see the use of the term in this scene as a reference to maiden's blood. And in case you think I'm reaching here by interpreting the above scene as a symbolic deflowering:

&gt;Brienne lurched to her feet. She was all mud and blood below the waist

What if Petyr Baelish is uninterested in ruling anyone

**The ruse:**

Petyr never had a chance with Catelyn because he was of relatively low birth and physically unimposing stature. In public he acts like he doesn't care, practicality) as less worthy than bloodline or musculature. Petyr pretends he only cares about anything but himself and his own position, but look at what he actually did. As master of coin under Robert, he could steal as much tax revenue as he liked. We haven't even had a clue that anyone suspected this. As long as people see Petyr as a moneygrubbing upjumped mockingbird, he wasn't a threat to them. As long as his ""goals"" remain clear and well-understood by others, they can't even begin to oppose his actual plans. So why would anyone in his position deliberately destabilize the realm? Remember, Petyr successfully formented *a massive civil war*. 

**The Oversight:**

Petyr feigns indifference to Catelyn and to matters of rank, but he doesn't care. They weren't really responsible for their own actions anyway. They were just a product of their upbringings. Petyr is taking bitter revenge on *the entire fuedal system*.
 
Imagine that you are Petyr Baelish and your goals are these:

(1) Destroy the power of the nobility

(2) Degrade the system of knighthood

(3) Gather personal wealth and influence.

If these are your goals

Petyr Baelish doesn't want to be king of the ashes of Westero. Petyr wants to live in a Westeros where there is no king, patient, diplomatic young man who has genuine feelings for her instead of some asshole with old blood who can swing a sword.

A master juggler was Petyr Baelish.
 
&gt;Oh, and put the king's gold to work. He bought wagons, shops, ships, houses. He bought grain when it was plentiful and sold bread when it was scarce. He bought wool from the north and linen from the south and lace from Lys, stored it, moved it, sold it. The golden dragons bred and multiplied
 
&gt;And in the process, tax farmers, custom sergeants, wool factors, toll collectors, pursers, wine factors; nine of every ten belonged to Littlefinger. They were men of middling birth, merchant's sons, far more able than their highborn predecessors.

###THE THEORY

Aegon (Little Griff) is **not** actually the baby of Rhaegar Targaryen and Elia Martell

****

###ARGUMENTS FOR  
.  
##MUMMER'S DRAGON VISION

One of Dany's visions in the House of the Undying:

&gt;. . . Glowing like sunset, breathing shadow fire. . . . *mother of dragons, slayer of lies* . . .

^ACOK ^48: ^DAENERYS ^IV

Dany later discusses the vision with Jorah:

&gt;“A dead man in the prow of a ship, *Khaleesi*? A mummer’s dragon, you said. What *is* a mummer’s dragon, pray?”  
“A cloth dragon on poles

^ACOK ^63: ^DAENERYS ^V

A ""mummer's dragon"" or fake dragon could be an metaphor for Aegon being a Blackfyre

##THE GOLDEN COMPANY

Illyrio and Tyrion discuss the [GC](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Golden_Company) breaking it's contract:

&gt;“I had heard the Golden Company was under contract with one of the Free Cities.”  
“Myr.” Illyrio smirked. “Contracts can be broken.”  
“There is more coin in cheese than I knew
The magister waggled his fat fingers. “**Some contracts are writ in ink
...  [Tyrion gives a history of the Golden Company and it's Blackfyre past]  ...  
“I admire your powers of persuasion
Illyrio brushed away the objection as if it were a fly. “Black or red

^ADWD ^5: ^TYRION ^II

This quote is the best evidence for the Blackfyre theory and offers a lot of insight. The GC was originally founded by [Bittersteel](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegor_Rivers) (Daemon Blackfyre's half-brother and closest ally)

The GC has never broken a contract

Illyrio's justification for the GC breaking contract is that ""black or red

&gt;Her brother Viserys had once feasted the captains of the Golden Company

^ADWD ^16: ^DAENERYS ^III

It would seem they turned down Viserys, and given the Toynes' bloody feud with the Targaryens it wouldn't make sense for him to make that contract to back a Targ. [[read more about it here courtesy of feldman10](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/156odh/spoilers_all_complete_analysis_of_the_blackfyre/c7jvga9)]

##ILLYRIO &amp; SERRA

Another interesting tidbit from Illyrio in the above quote includes him specifically saying the **male** Blackfyre line was extinguished. This would seem to indicate a female line survived. That female could have been Illyrio's late wife Serra. Here is what he says of her:

&gt;Illyrio thrust his right hand up his left sleeve and drew out a silver locket. Inside was a painted likeness of a woman with **big blue eyes and pale golden hair streaked by silver**. “Serra. I found her in a Lysene pillow house and brought her home to warm my bed, but I did not care. The price was small enough, for Serra.”  
...  
“Good fortune

^ADWD ^5: ^TYRION ^II

We know from this that Serra has Valyrian features

&gt;“Are you quite certain that Daenerys will make good her brother’s promises?”  
“She will, not all that a man does is done for gain. Believe as you wish, but even fat old fools like me have friends, and debts of affection to repay.”  
*Liar

^ADWD ^5: ^TYRION ^II

So what is this ""debt of affection"" Illyrio looks to repay that is worth more than ""coins"" and ""castles""? He may be trying to fulfill Serra's wish for their son to take the Iron Throne on behalf of the Blackfyres. While this all fits

Another piece of evidence possibly indicating Illyrio is Aegon's father is a statue he has in his manse that looks a lot like Aegon (Illyrio later claims it's a young version of himself)[/u/jbtalley]

&gt;A naked boy stood on the water, with straight blond hair that brushed his shoulders. So lifelike did he seem that it took the dwarf a long moment to realize he was made of painted marble, though his sword shimmered like true steel.


^ADWD ^1: ^TYRION ^I


##SEPTON MERIBALD'S STORY

Septon Meribald tells Brienne and Pod the story of the Crossroads Inn:

&gt;""...He forged a new sign for the yard, so the inn became known far and wide as the Clanking Dragon.”  
“Is the dragon sign still there?” asked Podrick.  
“No, and his lordship was fiercely loyal to the king. The sight of the black iron dragon made him wroth, so he cut down the post, hacked the sign into pieces, and cast them into the river. One of the dragon’s heads washed up on the Quiet Isle many years later, though by that time it was red with rust...""

 ^AFFC ^37: ^BRIENNE ^VII

This story could be an allegory for Aegon being a Blackfyre. A black dragon is Blackfyre and a red dragon is a Targaryen. So the black dragons (Blackfyres) were forced across the Narrow Sea and many years later one of them (Aegon) rusted over and now appears to be a red dragon (Targ). 

##VARYS IS A BLACKFYRE

Varys being a Blackfyre is the most speculative part of the theory and need not be true for the other parts to be true. The evidence for it is entirely circumstantial, so that he can hide his Valyrian hair (although the same would be true if he were of any Valyrian descent, Blackfyre or otherwise). Also, why Varys was castrated as a boy. He tells Tyrion the following about his castration:

&gt;“One day at Myr, but in truth the only part of me he had need of was my manhood. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a long hooked blade, he sliced me root and stem, chanting all the while. I watched him burn my manly parts on a brazier. The flames turned blue, and I heard a voice answer his call, though I did not understand the words they spoke.""

^ACOK ^44: ^TYRION ^X

We know from Melisandre's practices that sorcerers prefer to use royal blood in their rituals. If Varys was a Blackfyre he would have royal blood.

##DUNK &amp; EGG

A large portion of the Dunk &amp; Egg novellas covers the history of the Blackfyre Rebellions. This could be hinting at a greater significance for the Blackfyres in the ASOAIF series as a whole. Of course it could also just be window dressing for the novellas and have no other significance.

##AEGON BEING SAVED DOESN'T MAKE SENSE

How could Varys have known Gregor would smash baby Aegon's face beyond recognition? It's unlikely this could have been planned. [/u/jbtalley]

##AGE DISCREPANCY

Aegon was born in 282AL

&gt;He was a lithe and well-made youth, or near enough to make no matter.

^ADWD ^8: ^TYRION ^III

Of course it's very plausible that an 18 year old could be mistaken for 16

##ADWD EARLY DRAFT

[/u/feldman10]  
Earlier drafts of ADWD chapters have other clues. It is speculated that Martin cut a lot this material because it made Aegon's parentage too obvious.

[From a 2005 reading of Tyrion II](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/54-pre-adwd-spoilers-tyrion-2-spoilers-for-adwd/): 
&gt;**""Illyrio says he wants to give Young Griff his blessings and has a gift for him in the chests**. Haldon tells him there is no time for the litter. **Illyrio gets angry and says there are things Griff must know.**  
...  
Haldon eyes Tyrion and then begins to speak in another language. Tyrion cannot tell what it is but think it might be Volantene. He catches a few words that come close to High Valyrian. The words he catches are, and **sword.""**

It has been speculated that Illyrio was going to give Young Griff ""Blackfyre

[From Elio](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/57038-are-there-any-blackfyre-heirs-left/page__st__60#entry2693597)
&gt;""An earlier draft of the ""lesson"" chapter had quite a bit more detail about Maelys the Monstrous and the Blackfyres (for those who have GoO's RPG

****

###ARGUMENTS AGAINST  
.  
##NO PROOF!

One big argument against this whole theory is that all of the evidence is basically circumstantial. That is not to say circumstantial evidence is invalid (especially in a book)

##VARYS'S TALK WITH KEVAN

This is what Varys tells a dying Kevan Lannister:

&gt;“Aegon?” For a moment he did not understand. Then he remembered. A babe swaddled in a crimson cloak
“No.” The eunuch’s voice seemed deeper. “He is here. Aegon has been shaped for rule since before he could walk. He has been trained in arms, he speaks several tongues, he has studied history and law and poetry. A septa has instructed him in the mysteries of the Faith since he was old enough to understand them. He has lived with fisherfolk, worked with his hands, swum in rivers and mended nets and learned to wash his own clothes at need. He can fish and cook and bind up a wound, he knows what it is like to be hungry, to be hunted, that a king must put his people first

^ADWD ^72: ^EPILOGUE

Varys directly answers Kevan's question about Aegon being dead and says he isn't. Why would Varys lie about Aegon to Kevan, so he likely knows if Aegon is really Aegon. So why lie to a dying man about it? Some possible answers are:

* Varys ""little birds"" were present when Kevan was dying
* Varys perhaps didn't lie. All he said is that ""Aegon"" isn't dead
* Varys doesn't know Aegon is a Blackfyre. Illyrio is the only one who knows and is playing him.",self,t5_2r2o9,1356114870.0,,EuronCrowsEye,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/156odh/spoilers_all_complete_analysis_of_the_blackfyre/

**Eddard + Ashara = Jon**  

A friend of mine who reads books *a lot* recently finished completely reading through the entire book series twice

When he finally finished a bunch of us were talking about what various theories he has and one thing he said was: ""I reckon that Young Griff is the son of Rhaegar and Lyanna"". At no point did he mention Jon or anyone else as the 'Tower of Joy baby'.  

We told him about the R+L=J theory and he thought about it for a bit

This is what I can remember:  

* Tyrion notes Young Griff to be ~2 years younger than Aegon-Original should be.   
* If Jon Connington is handed a new born babe at a time when Aegon-Original would be about 2 years old
* If R+L=J, whisk him off to the Free Cities, but not Rhaenys for some reason, and then hope that the Mountain smashes the face of Not-Aegon into unrecognisable smithereens **-or-** Aegon-Original isn't replaced before the sack of KL and did actually die but then Varys and Illyrio pretend that they did whisk him off and hand over a replacement baby to Jon Connington that would still not fit the age gap he should be and would question the legitimacy of claiming the baby is Rhaegar's
* Eddard would have risked taking a babe back to Winterfell that would have grown up with Targeryen features that would have been extremely obvious to any onlookers.  
* It gives Eddard a flaw
* It fits the story better
* It's easier to explain in the last 2 books. Who can confirm R+L=J now? Howland Reed. Who can confirm R+L=A? Howland Reed still, Ashara and Jon Connington. Is GRRM basically going to have Howland Reed turn up as some kind of *deus ex machina* to say ""Oh by the way guys, Jon Snow is really the son of Rhaegar and Lyanna and should thus be King. I know there's no other evidence but you can trust me""  
* It still fits Young Griff being the Mummer's Dragon in the HOTU vision. He claims to be THE Aegon. He is still an Aegon
* Varys still does not lie about Aegon's return. The only difference being that Kevan assumes a different Aegon  

* **Edit** Ned told Jon they'd talk about his mother. Would Ned have seen him again and been all like ""Psyche! I'm not really going to tell you"". He could have told him it was Ashara Dayne


Sorry for the absolutely messy way I've presented this but I'm doing this mostly from memory of a long conversation a couple days ago.

Lightbringer is not a sword


This assumes that R+L=J and that Lyanna died giving birth to Jon Snow. Rhaegar's wife Elia Martell was also said to be pretty sickly. In Jon Connington's chapter ""The Griffin Reborn""


Rhaegar, Rhaegar started to look around for other potential mothers. Enter Lyanna with all her love and beauty. 


Rhaegar had a third child with Lyanna


Jon Snow was the third (important) and the only one who killed his mother (more important). There is another prophecy that involves a forging that took three attempts, but instead a child. When forging Lightbringer it took Azor Ahai three tries before he finally got it right and then sacrificed his wife Nissa Nissa on the third and final forge.


In attempting to fulfill one prophecy


Metaphorically


* R+L=J
* Robert Baratheon starts a war causing all Targs to be killed or hidden
* Daenerys and Viserys are brought to Essos to hide them

I didn't really expect the scene with Stannis, that scene was either supposed to be THE moment that show-watchers realize why many book-readers love Stannis so much, or it was supposed to have been a cliff-hanger that would lead to that revelation next season.  Instead, we get neither, and the scene is subtly changed so that it takes an entirely different direction.

I speculate that Varys is the grandson of Aerion ""Brightflame"" Targaryen. This started when I saw that Varys said he'd been born in Lys. Assuming this is true


**208 AL** - Aerion Targaryen is exiled to Lys where he fathered at least one child.

**232 AL** - Aerion drank wildfire and died. 

**233 AL** - King Maekar I died. A Great Council was called to determine succession. The two oldest sons, bastard infant. Instead they offered the crown to Maester Aemon, who famously refused it, and the crown went to King Aegon V.

**243 AL** - ""Mad"" King Aerys was born.

**248 AL** - Aerion's bastard son would have been 16. This seems to be a normal age to father your first child in Westeros/Esso. I propose he fathered at least Varys.

**259 AL** - Prince Rhaegar is born.

**276 AL** - King Aerys summoned Varys to court to become his spymaster. If he was born in the range between Aerys and Rhaegar

**282-283 AL** - Robert's Rebellion. Most known Targaryens die.

**300 AL** -  The events of *A Dance With Dragons*


**Supplemental:**

Varys says that he was born a slave in Lys. He shaves his head, similar to what Melisandre's been trying to do with ""king's blood."" This might also hint at his royal lineage. Perhaps it wasn't for magic at all; perhaps castration was simply to put an end to yet another ""splinter"" Targaryen dynasty. I also think that ""Varys"" sounds like a bastardization (no pun intended) of a typical Targaryen name ending in -eris or -erys.

This would explain a lot of his Targaryen loyalist tendencies. But the question of his complicity in sending assassins after Dany in GOT is an unanswered one. 

*If you want to upgrade to ""Tinfoil"":* Note that Illyrio's beloved wife Serra was also from Lys.

WARNING: viking story

In Norse mythology, especially compared to his brother Baldr. In fact, Hodur is blind. He isn't very important in the pantheon, and he rarely appears in the stories. *Until he helps trigger the end of the world.*

The way the story goes is that Odin and his wife were really paranoid about Baldr dying, Norse gods can die. Just stay with me for a bit.) So they went around to all the living things and made them promise to never harm Baldr. They made everything promise, with the exception of mistletoe, since it was so young. 

Remember, everyone got roaring drunk and started throwing things at Baldr because nothing could harm him. However, Loki, the god of mischief, found out that mistletoe never promised, so he made a spear/arrow of mistletoe and sauntered on over to Hodur, who was standing away from everyone else since he's kind of a loner. 

Loki asks Hodur why he isn't having fun with everyone else by chucking stuff at Baldr, throws the mistletoe, and it kills Baldr. Shit goes down, there is a wild manhunt for Loki, and then one of Odin's sons goes ahead and kills Hodur to take revenge for Baldr (a dick move since Hodur is blind and Loki manipulated him). These events  lead to Ragnarok, the end of the world, and an [awesome battle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnar%C3%B6k). 

Okay, though he was a viking so he was probably jacked), but suffer from some kind of limitation. Then, and this is the big one, **they are unable to hurt other living things unless someone manipulates them.**

Bran is warging into Hodor on a pretty regular basis now, but I do find it eerie and similar to Loki using Hodur. So, if GRRM got some of his inspiration from Norse myths, I'm thinking that someone (Bran, Bloodraven, or a third party) will use Hodor for something dark. And Hodor will die. Though let's be honest, GRRM doesn't have any qualms with killing fan favorites.

The thing is though that Hodor has done nothing bad to anyone. He doesn't deserve to die. I'm kind of thinking of when Catelyn killed Jinglebells. Hodor is one of the sweetest, and I think Hodor will have the same fate. 

Though of course

1362151488.0,19grs4,(Spoilers all) Leaked and rumored changes for Season 3,feldman10,520,90,469,"Last year I wrote [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/otonb/rumored_changes_for_season_2_spoilers_all_books/) compiling the leaked and rumored changes from the books for Season 2. So here's what I've seen on various sites about Season 3 changes. Last year's thread was pretty accurate

Overall it appears that this season will stick much more closely to the books than S2 did. There will be many changes

* **King's Landing**: The biggest changes of the year will be in King's Landing. Since Joff's wedding will be in Season 4, rather than Sansa and Willas. We also know there will be many invented scenes so the various Tyrell characters can share scenes with the various Lannisters and Sansa. Also, there will be a subplot with Ros (big surprise). Speculation has Ros as, in some way, a substitution for Dontos, who has been cut from the season.

* **Stannis**: The most controversial change of the year by far will likely be to Stannis. There's no word of Edric Storm being cast

* **Jon**: The recognizable actor Mackenzie Crook was cast as Orell. It seems likely that Orell will be a composite of the eagle-skinchanger Jon kills in ACOK and Varamyr (one eagle is cheaper than 6 wild beasts). The battles at the Wall and Ygritte's death are almost certainly not going to happen this season. We can assume this because the actor who plays Pyp revealed that he did only one day of filming this season. Pyp remained at the Wall and is not in Mormont's party

* **Dany**: Many think that Dany will free the Unsullied at the end of the season. In fact

* **Theon**: A leaked audition video sheds some light on Theon's (invented) scenes too. Apparently Theon wakes up and is led to believe that he is being held by the *ironborn*

* **Robb**: A tweet from Oona Chaplin led many to believe that Talisa will attend the Red Wedding

* **Jaime**: The Vargo Hoat role is being taken by a character named Locke

* **Littlefinger**: There will be invented scenes in the Eyrie with Lysa and Sweetrobin in at least one episode this year. I suspect this is Littlefinger visiting to propose marriage,False,self,t5_2r2o9,False,,TheImp,t3_19grs4

And there's one thing Ned should have done, and she barely made it out of KL as it is. If it weren't for Syrio, she would have been captured, and because she ISN'T as good at playing the political game as Sansa...she would probably have been maimed or killed by Joffrey for refusing to submit, or for humiliating him during AGOT (which, interestingly enough, was stupid of her and smart of Sansa. Arya did the RIGHT thing

But that's all a matter of opinion. What bothers me the most about how people talk about is Sansa is how they overlook the content of her chapters post-AGOT. People always say she is ""naive"" and ""shows no agency"", but these two are my favorite. The first from ACOK:

&gt;Sansa watched him walk off, she thought, but t he queen spoke to me gently too. He ’s still a Lannister, her brother and Joff ’s uncle, and no friend. Once she had loved Prince Joffrey with all her heart, and admired and trusted his mother, the queen. They had repaid that love and trust with her father’s head. Sansa would never make that mistake again.

The second from ASOS:

&gt;They are children, they’ve never seen a man die, they know nothing. Their dreams were full of songs and stories, the way hers had been before Joffrey cut her father's head off. Sansa pitied them. Sansa envied them.

If you really focus on Sansa's chapters, but they know it probably will not happen, so the dreams themselves become the only means of escape. We also see multiple instances of her stepping up and making things happen:

* She convinces Joffrey to save Dontos

* During the Battle of the Blackwater, Cersei runs away, leaving Sansa to believe she's going to get beheaded at any second. However, instead of totally losing her cool like all the other noblewomen and elderly men hiding out with her, she takes charge and restores order to the situation.

* Even after being forced to marry the family of the people who killed her father, she doesn't lose her ability to ACT courteous and polite. Sansa doesn't even get the opportunity to cry for her family, because the queen's eyes and ears are everywhere. She has to bottle everything up and still pretend to be happy...and she does it flawlessly.

* She realizes

* She accurately pieces together Littlefinger's machinations with the Vale nobles.

-Palatability on screen. The implication of a similarly-aged Arya stand in being brutally treated by Ramsay is a bit far for the show


-Previous history of abuse on screen. We have already seen Ros on the receiving end of abuse from Cersei. This creates a pattern and a built-in sympathy for Ros' plight. 


-Previous history with Theon. The potential for interaction between Theon and Ros has much more depth than Theon-Jeyne, even recommended her to Tyrion. This will make the reveal of Theon as Reek to Ros and the ""get her ready"" scene have much more gravity and emotion.

1370825454.0,1g0j43,[Spoilers All] The possibility of a certain character becoming a villain.,Hutchbugger,501,86,260,"There was another thread where this image was posted: http://imgur.com/BFSiIT8 which (I think?) got removed for being an image post but I wanted to actually discuss the possibility of it.

In my opinion it's (the image) actually a much more real possibility than you might think at first. At the very least I would say that most peoples expectations about Jon's future are completely on the wrong track.

Whenever GRRM talks about characters coming back to life in other fiction, it's horiffic, and they pretty much would have been better off dead. Beric slowly and sadly loses his identity and Stoneheart is almost an entirely new character fueled only by vengance and rage.

If we assume Jon's wounds at the end of ADWD were fatal (Though this is NOT as sure a thing as many people think), he will be changed significantly, both physically and mentally. These changes would likely be accompanied by a drastic shift in Jon's role in the story.

But what kind of shift? What seems likely, which we know we will see more of. It probably won't be Bran or Melisandre, and really what other options are there? Jon may very well join the Others in some capacity. It's doesn't even require him becoming totally ""evil"". Based on GRRM's ""wait and see"" comment when asked about the others being a one dimensional, evil force, we can expect that the Others are more than just simplistic bad guys. If you look for the ""A dragon plants no trees"" post it's likely that Dany will be the one fulfilling the role of the ""bad guy"". Maybe the Others are stirring in anticipation of the evil her dragons will bring. Maybe the giant wall made of ICE was actually made by the people who we know are extremely skilled at magically manipulating ice. And who better to figure that out than the one character who has the best track record at looking past his preconceptions of people(Tyrion/Satin/Wildlings)? There is certainly precedent for rouge Nights Watch Lord Commanders joining the Others. There is also precedent for a quasi-wight/warg character in Coldhands, who is clearly dead and yet seems to function fine. That fits with Bran's dream in AGOT where Jon becomes ""cold and hard"" at the wall. He is being foreshadowed to be Azor Ahai, but a straight fulfillment of the prophesy is unlikely.

1361298791.0,18txqb,(Spoilers ALL) Regarding Shae the Funny Whore,A_Polite_Noise,534,121,128,"I'd like to talk about Shae


It seems like everyone looks at Tyrion's constant fretting and telling himself about how Shae is a whore and doesn't love him and is only there because of the money is part of his cleverness; bordering on prescience, in differing percentages, in this series.  Tyrion is no different.  Being a fan favorite (and perhaps also being someone many fans might relate to, seeing themselves as clever and bookish and shunned unfairly by those around them), Tyrion seems to get a free pass on many of his failings and sins.



What is often looked upon as a very good piece of advice from Tyrion is, because the world surely won't; he should wear it like armor so it cannot be used to hurt him.  However, this situation of identity, self identity, and identity as perceived by others is a major theme of the series.  People are constantly shifting identities, taking on disguises and false names, taking on new positions of power or lack thereof (from Hand to prisoner in the dungeon, from mummer to Lord of Whispers


As many times as he seems to be cocky and sure and confident, it isn't prescience or cleverness that tells him that because of his short stature and appearance no one can ever love him, and because of Shae's occupation as a whore she could never love him and is only around for the money.  To me that is him ignoring the evidence before him, constantly telling himself that what he sees and judges and weights with his own clever mind and his eyes is *false*; that what he sees *cannot be true* because *she and I are not possibly more than the sum of our parts; I am an unlovable freak, and she is an unloving whore.  Period.*



This, how *readily* he believed the lie about his first wife.  *Of course* it was all a ruse and she was paid; how could it *possibly* have been real love?  When he finds out that what he had assumed was a deception for so long was true, it turns his entire idea of his identity and self-worth out the window...and as a result he collapses and tears down all the relationships that he *had* cherished post-Tysha (namely his brotherly love with Jaime and his relationship with Shae).



Many look to Shae's betrayal at the trial as proof that she was only in for the money, but we won't get into that just now).  Shae was the private personal companion of Tyrion when he was Hand, but she was no fool.  It was clear, if not from Tyrion's own words then from her ability to see the situation, that despite the title Tyrion was not exactly the most respected of Lannisters.  It was made clear to her from the start that Tywin did not want her in King's Landing; that she was there in a clandestine manner, hidden, and that there was danger for her even while protected by the Hand of the King.  When Tyrion's status is destroyed and he is accused of regicide and kinslaying both


Now she is in the hands of Tywin.  She is in the hands of Cersei.  She is the consort of the already-hated imp who is now accused of killing the boy king; her status is even lower because of that than the lowliest street whore.  She is the whore of a treasonous monster.  So what else could she do?  Even if she loved him with all her heart, would suffer what Cersei (Qyburn!) and Tywin would do to her if she did not bury Tyrion?  No one is saying she is the bravest or most noble characters, but I think it is too much to deny her love.



So she said ""Giant of Lannister"".  Some would say that is evidence; why use that phrase she had shared with him if it wasn't all a lie?  Well, seeing people of higher status and position in safer situations destroy Tyrion...she grasped onto the phrase she had said possibly dozens of times to him in their time together...no one said she is a mummer, or a perfect deceiver.  It was always on the tip of her tongue when she spoke to him, and she may have known how damning it sounded.  So she said it.  She didn't seem happy when she did; some would argue it was because she was a brilliant actress putting on the performance of the abused prostitute of a monster.  But maybe it was because she felt guilty.



Then she said it again in Tywin's bedchamber.  Why would she betray Tyrion for Tywin, she needed *safety*.  So she put on her best smile and did what she had done for years:  warmed someones bed.  The fact that she made the mistake of using the same words she used to damn him *was*, as Tyrion said, the ""wrong thing to say"".  But it is not an indication of her lying; she had said it dozens, if not hundreds (unseen to us between chapters) of times to him *in love*.  She had only said it once, in a panic state, before the entire royal court, an automatic response...and yes


And so Tyrion, racked with guilt, drank and drank and drank.  Even he, in ADWD, talks about his sins against Shae; while some readers say ""That bitch got whats coming; she just wanted the money!"", even at one point in his drunken journey Tyrion himself has a moment, a twinge, and it was not a moment to cheer at.  It is his sin...she said the wrong thing



What supports this for me is that the episode in season 2 that Martin himself wrote makes much of the love between Shae and Tyrion


Many would say that when Tyrion murders Shae, and that's how the chapter in A Storm of Swords always read to me:  A tragic, sad, end to what may have been real love, and a display of Tyrion's great flaw in never forgetting what he was *to others*, and what Shae was *to others*, and completely forgetting what they were *to each other*.


**TL;DR**:  Shae loved Tyrion and wasn't just in it for the $$$; she betrayed him for survival, regretful, vile monster (truly becoming what the world has always thought he is, instead of what he knew he was) in ADWD.

Joffrey is the epitome of a spoiled, it's your fucking fault, and it's truly a tragedy. Cruelty is a learned behavior. Joffrey has spent his entire life yearning for the acceptance and love of his father, which he never got. Joffrey never had a true father figure (or a mother figure really.) All of the cruel things he does are for attention and acceptance. He believe that Bobby B will only love him if he shows he is ""strong,"" however nobody has ever taken the time to instill what true strength is into Joff, or any real virtues for that matter. He has been neglected by everybody who is supposed to love and raise him. Combine that with being born an heir to a kingdom, you've got a recipe for spoiled-brat syndrome. Now, what I'm saying is that what he does

Let's contrast Jon with Joff. Had Ned Stark not been a stand up dude and raised him with the same love as he did for the rest of his children, hate-harboring bastard that Joff is. Jon even plays on this when he meets Mance (""Did you see where they sat the bastard?"")

Daddy's always drunk + Mommy's always drunk + both think their jobs are more important than you = one fucked up kid. Now give that kid a kingdom and see what happens.

The end of Autumn and nothing more.  

Ah,  
The tower glowing like an ember
And on they came
Our green boys some still unshaven
Our cloaks blacker than the raven
Yet none dare ever call us craven... ""  


You know nothing


For the rare and fire-kissed maiden lay bleeding upon the floor.  


Nameless here forevermore.  


Presently my heart starts beating
Recalling all the moments fleeting  
Every of her jape and torment  
Stirred my desire that lay dormant.  
And all at once my honor crumbled
Inside the cave where we both stumbled  


I approached shyly as she undressed
And broke my vows upon her breast.  


Everything done has been done before
And there’s too many lost in this long war
And I fear there will be many more…  


 ""You know nothing""


My direwolf on the floor is napping
And yet still I hear a rapping
Of Clydas patiently tapping
I rise
And the gaunt face that greets me
Solemnly entreats me  
To let him pass beyond my chamber door.  
As he enters my safe haven
And offers corn unto my raven
I ask him what he came here for.  


As he explains
And his outstretched hand starts shaking
A message sealed in pink comes to the fore.  


Titled “Bastard” and nothing more.  


I feel an awful dread a waking
And as I read a sweat starts breaking
He thinks the Stark home his for the taking.  


By the gods


Quorked the Raven “Forevermore”  


On Northern throne he is still seated
And claims Stannis has been defeated
And with his wicked bastard blade  
Saw that the Rayder’s wives were flayed  
And offers me a coward’s trade.  


Aye
But with sword and axe and torch and lance
He’ll soon find the true cost of war…  


“You know nothing” I heard her implore  


I speak to my men
Like a fountain
Then I hear a thunderous roaring
Roaring outside my chamber door.  


“Tis the wind and nothing more”  


As I approach
Of Ser Patrek’s head a bashing
Crashing against my chamber floor.  


Tis our giant making war.  
Only this and nothing more.  


Upon my person
And suddenly a knife is stabbing
My throat,  
“For the Watch” I hear

 
All around
And I weep for what I ne'er told her
To lay my head upon her shoulder
Is all I want and nothing more.  


Quorked the raven “Nevermore”

It's that time again

Have you ever wondered whether Robert Baratheon could defeat Eddard Stark in a one-on-one fight? This fun, however, we aren't just taking brawn into consideration. Read on to learn more.

***

**--Background/Rules--**

* The tournament in 2011 was a very basic tournament where we simply voted for who we thought would win in a 1-v-1 fight. It ended with Barristan Selmy defeating Arthur Dayne. The tournament in 2012 was a more complicated version, and the crows voted for which scenario they liked most. Sandor Clegane defeated Garlan Tyrell in that version. [See here for more information](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/wiki/tournaments) or just to relive the days of yore. As for 2013? Well... let us tell you about 2013: it is going to be legend (wait for it...)...

* This year is going to be **Warriors** versus **Players**. No longer shall only the strength of one's arm determine whether or not a character can win all the glory! One whole conference will be Warriors, the toughest. The other will be Players, such as: Tyrion, Wyman Manderly, the Damphair, Arya, even Varys-- any character who may not survive long in a one on one fight against, Gregor Clegane but who

* In the Warriors bracket the writeups will go as normal with a fighting scenario: who wins in a fight, who would win and why: who is faster, stronger; who is better equipped, better trained. A well written scenario might make even Pod seem like the Sword of the Morning so it truly is anyone's game. 

* In the Players bracket the scenarios will be about how one player assassinates the other. How he or she conspires to manipulate events in order to defeat their chosen foe. Does Littlefinger convince Asha to poison her father, and written by you crows, for the Players bracket!

* The finals will be a **Trial by Two** scenario. The winner of the Player bracket will team up with the runner-up of the Warrior bracket. The winner of the Warrior bracket will be teamed up with the runner-up of the Player bracket. So if Lord Petyr Baelish defeats Lord Varys to get to the final round, argue them, and cry foul when our favorite scenario loses... or brag forevermore if our favorite scenario wins (especially if we're the one who wrote it!).

* We are going to continue the tradition of not allowing any previous winners, Dayne, Sandor, Garlan - all out. They cannot be nominated this year. Take heart though: with the Players bracket added, a huge amount of characters have been added to the selecting pool.

* Most of the specific rules are going to be copied from last year

***

**--Schedule of events--**

* Tomorrow we will post a thread where you can vote on participants. The highest 16 for each bracket (Warriors and Players) will go on to play in the tournament. We will use a traditional 32 person bracket format using rankings, they will face each other in the first round.

* On Friday we will post the official brackets completely filled out.

* On Sunday the first ""Scenario Submission Thread"" will open

***

We look forward to participating in this with you

and as always your humble servants

Ned is a specimen uncommon to Westeros. The world of ASOIAF permits many different people to get by. Pragmatic power players at the continental level abound, sellswords readily embrace a seedy reputation and line of work for their shot at a big score, women adapt to their station in society by trying to use their femininity as a weapon or a tool.

But Ned is a rare man. Others see a world where power is a constant, and he has born the consequences of those unexpected losses with tremendous humility and self-doubt. 

You know what intrigues me about Ned? I have absolutely *no idea* what Ned wants. Almost every character in this series, sure. Do I know what Varys or Petyr want in detail, for certain? No, but I know that at some level, it's power and control. I know what drives the others too, be it love or spite or respect or fear or psychosis. But I simply don't know about Ned. He didn't want the throne, hell he didn't even want to be Lord of Winterfell. Can a person really exist in this universe who lives simply to do what they believe is right

So what is Ned? Is he largely a plot device? Is he the vessel through which we are given much of the Starks' history in the first book, does he exist so that he can die and set in motion the war that will come to dominate the rest of the series?

Or is Ned's story meant to be a parable, his actions, and his fate and conclude that in a world where you cannot trust ideals to supplant your fellow man's base nature, honor is an empty value, and as such it should be maligned? Or should we view it such that honor makes a life something more virtuous than what it was otherwise, and Ned's death, for choosing honor rather than what some realists might call the ""smart choices""

There are complications to these questions too, and that Ned's promise to Lyanna has been to conceal Jon as his ""bastard"" son for his safety, or that Jon is indeed Ned's son by an as-of-yet undetermined woman. What does the true outcome mean for his honor, and for how we view him? Is he not the man we think of if he really did stray from his wife? Is he even nobler than we could imagine for being willing to take the stain on his honor of claiming a bastard that isn't his, when only he will ever know the truth?

Sometimes, his history burnt to ashes and his destiny to return to a castle he did not feel he deserved, honors he did not want, and a wife whose very existence must have reminded him of the brother she was pledged to marry first? Was he the same man he had been in his youth? Could any lifetime of happiness have made up for what had happened to him and the burdens he went on to bear? I really don't know.

What do you think about Ned?

&gt; Lt. Commander Ron Hunter: “Yes


Introduction
-
In my [first post](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1hibqm/spoilers_all_a_complete_analysis_of_robb_stark_as/), Robb paved the way for the great strategic defeat of the Northern Rebellion through poor endstate conception.

When we left Robb yesterday, Robb began to turn his focus westward.

Politics by Another Means
-

&gt; ""Dad

I left out a lot of the political side of the equation yesterday, because well, honestly I'm not anywhere close to an expert, and I wanted to jump right into the military tactics and strategy. But I'll try in an attempt to summarize as it relates to the Robb's military strategy.

What was the endstate of Robb's objective in fighting this war against the Lannisters? We get an idea of his objective when Robb instructs Cleos Frey of his demands to give to KL. He says the following:

&gt; ""Lastly, as of old. Our domain shall include all the Stark lands north of the Neck, and in addition the lands watered by the River Trident and its vassal streams, bounded by the Golden Tooth to the west and the Mountains of the Moon in the east."" - *ACOK, Chapter 7, Catelyn I*

Essentially, Catelyn makes this curious observation:

&gt; ""But bearded or no

Revenge as an endstate is not a clear goal or objective (As the BWB will come to find out with Stoneheart at the healm). It has a cataract effect on the individual and has the ability to make the mission and endstate of a war unclear or at least myopic.

Anyways, it also had the effect of expanding the territory which Robb was forced to defend.

Realizing he needed more allies to win his war, asshole father could keep dissuade Theon from becoming the turncloak. Even Catelyn, not known for being the most foresighted politician in Westeros, realizes this.

&gt; ""I'll say again, Chapter 7, Catelyn I*

His other political decision was only foolish in retrospect. He sent his mother south to entreat with Renly Baratheon. Now, to argue that it made the most **pragmatic** sense to ally with the strongest anti-Lannister faction in the realm. Of course, that ended in complete disaster, but not on account of Catelyn's attempts.

I'll leave it for there on the political side.


Tit for Tat: The Westerlands Campaign
-

&gt; ""The Young Wolf was paying the Lannisters back in kind for the devastation they'd inflicted on the riverlands."" - *ACOK

[Simple Map of Disposition of Forces Prior to Start of the Westerlands Campaign](http://imgur.com/sVtp9B2) (**Note**: I ~~may have~~ placed Roose Bolton's host too far north on my map. [A wiki of ice and fire](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/images/b/b2/War_in_the_North3.png) has Roose just east of the Twins at this time.)

Following the Battle of the Camps

In this position

Now here I'm going to admit confusion. Was Robb's intent to take the Westerlands while they were weak

&gt; ""We planned to run Lord Tywin a merry chase up and down the coast, Chapter 14, Catelyn II*

To this end, I'll get to that later. 

Turning back to the Westerlands campaign

&gt; ""He (Robb) slipped around it at night. It's said the direwolf showed him the way..."" - *ACOK

One of the more interesting responses I received yesterday came from /u/I_Said who [posited that Robb warged into Greywind](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1hibqm/spoilers_all_a_complete_analysis_of_robb_stark_as/cav4q0o?context=3) to accomplish this task. I don't have an opinion on it

Having successfully passed through the Golden Tooth without detection, a dedicated enemy can and will find a way to kill you.) The Lannister scouts dead, Robb descended on the host utilizing one of my favorite terms: **violence of action**, that is: moving quickly and violently in order to leave your enemies, scattered, leaderless and unable to defend themselves from the onslaught. The result was a rout. The new Lannister host was destroyed, Ser Stafford Lannister was dead and the Westerlands were ripe for plunder.

Ashemark fell to the Stark/Tully host and was sacked partially in retribution for the burning that the Lannisters did in the Riverlands, the Greajon Umber seized the goldmines in Castamere. This seizure of the gold and denial of a source of income may have been the linchpin which forced Tywin to move west, though that's a topic for debate. 

While Robb's leal lords upended the Westerland economy

1365955854.0,1cbwef,(Spoilers All) Complete Analysis: The Blackfyre claim to the throne and illegitimacy of the current Targaryen line.,pimpst1ck,476,76,128,"About a month ago

*Note: This theory assumes that Aegon ""Young Griff"" Targaryen is in fact a Blackfyre.  You can argue over this elsewhere

**1. The Accusation**

One of the biggest reasons for the Blackfyre rebellion was the accusation that King Daeron II The Good was not the trueborn son of Aegon IV and his sister-wife Naerys



* Naerys loathed her husband

* Prince Aemon was one of the only two people who could make Naerys smile.  The other was her son Daeron - possible link.

* Naerys was slandered by Ser Morgil for some yet unknown reason.  Prince Aemon was famous for defending her honor and slaying Ser Morgil.  The slander could possibly have been of her affair with Prince Aemon

The accusation was no doubt well known

&gt;My grandfather named me for Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, depending on which tale you believe (AGOT)

And Aemon's love for Naerys was also testified by Sansa

&gt;Prince Aemon the Dragonknight cried the day Princess Naerys wed his brother Aegon (ACOK)

Therefore the circumstances regarding the possible affair were certainly well known.

This accusations answers the question why Aegon IV decided to legitimise all his bastards on his deathbed.  Aegon IV had already acknowledged Daemon I after Baelor I's death and even given his the ancestral Targaryen Valyrian sword *Blackfyre*, but ALL his acknowledged bastards (Bittersteel, Bloodraven and Shiera Seastar), even though Daemon was the eldest and the only one with pure Targaryen ancestry (his mother was Daena the Defiant).

If for some reason Aegon IV discovered N+A=DII (maybe Naerys told him as a last ""Fuck you"", Aegon IV legitimises all his bastards, thus putting them on equal standing to Daeron II and letting them sort it out for themselves.  This is also consistent with Aegon IV's character, as he showed certain affection towards his sons (bastards or not), but didn't really care about the fate of the realm.

**2. Parallels with the present timeline**

One of the most compelling arguments for N+A=DII comes not from evidence present in the story

* Both Aegon VI started their reigns young and handsome

* Both rulers were more or less completely arbitrary about governing the realm

* Both rulers were notorious womanisers and had multiple whores and mistresses.  Both were fine flaunting it in front of their significant others.

* Both rulers had wives who utterly loathed them

* Both rulers' wives were accused of incest with their younger brothers

* Both died leaving a huge succession crisis

* Both had sons accused of being bastard abominations ascend to the throne in wars of succession (Blackfyre Rebellion

* Both sired numerous bastards used in the succession wars (Bloodraven/Bittersteel

As shown above

**3. Parallels with real history: Henry VII**

As said above, including golden hair with a silver streak (fun fact, this is the reverse of Elaena Targaryen, Daena's sister, who had silver hair with a golden streak - possible tinfoil reference to inverted Blackfyre colours).  Thus when the male line of Blackfyres died out with Maelys the Monstrous, only the female line remained.  Aegon Blackfyre's ancestry would share similar traits to that of Henry Tudor, also known as Henry VII of England.

Henry Tudor's claim to the English Throne was quite weak.  Not only was it derived from his mother, making them technically illegitimate.  Richard II, John of Gaunt's nephew, officially declared them legitimate.  However when John of Gaunt's son by his first wife Henry IV came to the throne, he upheld their legitimacy, but disqualified from the line of succession (although this wasn't really legal, it just weakened Henry Tudor's claim).  Henry Tudor's claim came from his mother Margaret Beaufort, one of the offspring of Jon of Gaunt and Katherine Swynford.

Therefore in terms of claims we see similar circumstances between Henry Tudor and Aegon Blackfyre.  Both come from legitimised bastards who were disqualified from succession

Firstly let us quickly remind ourselves of the similarities between Richard III and Stannis Baratheon that others have pointed out.  Both previously were loyal to their families

When Henry Tudor came to claim the throne of England, House of Beaufort had also recently died in the male line in battle, thus leaving no other Beauforts descended from John of Gaunt.  Henry had spent 14 years across the English channel in Brittany and France, where he borrowed supplies and soldiers from Lancastrian loyalists and jumped back across the channel attempting a quick invasion. 

Sound familiar?  Some of the more important details:

* Both Aegon Blackfyre and Henry Tudor have claims derived from their mother and legitimised bastards

* Both have been in exile across a narrow sea

* Beaufort = Blackfyre

* Opponents include Stannis Barathon/Richard III

**4. Implications with the Golden Company**

One of the pieces of evidence used for the Blackfyre theory is that the Golden Company, when he saw exiled Westerosi Lord and Knights disbanding.  Even today, the Golden Company is filled with many descended from Blackfyre loyalists.

Most notable of these include the current and previous Captain-Generals of the company

Previous to him was Myles Toyne, resulting in him being slowly executed by dismemberment.  Following this Torrence's brothers attempted to kill Aegon IV, but were foiled by Prince Aemon who sacrificed his life to save Aegon IV.  Considering if N+A=DII, that would have meant the Toynes would have a strong antagonism against the memory of Prince Aemon.  Thus who better than to organise the Golden Company for a plot that would disgrace the memory of Aemon the Dragonknight?  Myles Toyne died in 297 AL, meaning by then he most certainly would have been contacted by Varys/Illyrio to assure their allegience.  Tristan Rivers mentioned the previous plan of Viserys joining them with the Dothraki, so this speculation can fairly be taken for granted.

**TL;DR** Therefore, due to Daeron II being the illegitimate son of Naerys and Aemon the Dragonknight (N+A=DII).  This is supported in the text as well as literary comparison between Robert I and Aegon IV

Also Aegon ""Young Griff"" Blackfyre is Henry Tudor

1372169860.0,1h1dr5,(Spoilers All) The strongest evidence for Varys's endgame,CobaltThunder,500,110,394,"After several weeks of lurking

There are two schools of thought as to Varys's motivations - I won't go into all the details

1) Varys is acting in the best interests of the 'realm' and the common man of Westeros.

2) Varys is a secret Blackfyre working to put Illyrio's son (also a Blackfyre) on the throne.

I initially didn't like the Blackfyre theory at all, black and red dragons and the rest of it. Namely, because I think there are two known pieces of evidence that completely disprove Varys's stated intentions of purely working for a peaceful and stable Westeros:

* When Rhaegar is planning his great council to deal with his father and possibly the Lords of Westeros are plotting for his removal

* At the end of ADwD, Cersei has been removed from her position of fucking everything up, alliance being cemented with the Tyrell family, end of the war), Varys directly causes instability by killing Kevan to cause the Tyrells and Lannisters to turn on each other. 

That's two chances for a peaceful

Given that Varys is now working to put Young Griff on the throne, or even before as Illyrio would presumably have told him his wife was pregnant.

It's also entirely possible that Varys *also* wants stability and peace

It would be a very GRRM thing to do - subverting the trope of ""guy you can root for because he is working towards a bigger cause"" by revealing that in fact

**TL;DR - Varys is a Blackfyre loyalist because he directly contributed to the Targaryen downfall by turning Aerys against Rhaegar,False,self,t5_2r2o9,False,,ReedOfGreywaterWatch,t3_1h1dr5

**Who Are Jon Snow's Parents?**

It's the question all A Song of Ice and Fire readers ask themselves in book one, had sex with Lyanna –- maybe consensually, maybe not –- and Lyanna died giving birth to Jon. Knowing that Jon would be in considerable danger if his half-Targaryen blood were revealed (remember, Robert was determined to kill every last Targaryen on the planet), he pretended the boy was his own bastard, and took him to Winterfell, telling nobody the truth. Although Ned is incredibly secretive regarding Jon's parentage, which was likely to keep Jon secret and safe.

Jon's parentage seems likely to most readers – so likely, possibly with some random woman, or possibly with Ashara Dayne, whom Ned was rumored to love. The question is whether Ned's honor is great enough to have precluded him from fathering a bastard — certainly Catelyn and Ned's friends were shocked at the idea Ned had cheated –- and as shown in GoT, Ned is honorable to a fault. So it seems unlikely, although if he did lapse, his shame might be the reason he's so quiet about Jon's parentage. But if his mother is Ashara Dayne or some random wench

Certainly

**Who Is Azor Ahai?**

Azor Ahai (also commonly called the Prince That Was Promised) is the legendary hero who defeated the Others long, when they return, with his sword Lightbringer. The red priestess Melisandre clearly believes Stannis Baratheon is Azor Ahai, and wants everyone to know it. However, Melisandre's visions of Azor Ahai don't seem to be nearly as Stannis-oriented as she seems to think, and most readers think if one character fits the bill, it will be Jon Snow, uh

But it might not just be one character. In The House of the Undying, but three? That would hint that Daenerys and Jon Snow are two of the Dragon's heads, but then who would be the third? There are two possible answers below. [For more](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Azor_Ahai/Theories)

**Might Tyrion Lannister Actually Be a Targaryen?**

We all know ""dragons"" equal ""Targaryens"" in A Song of Ice and Fire. Daenerys is already a Targaryen, too. So what about Tyrion? Some readers believe that the Mad King Aerys is Tyrion's real father, having forced himself on Tywin's wife Joanna, with Tywin never knowing, or possibly even being a willing pimp. GRRM mentions at one point that Aerys definitely found Joanna attractive. Jon describes Tyrion as having hair so blonde as to be white, which sounds a lot more like Targaryen's hair color than the Lannister blonde; plus, Tyrion has one green eye (very Lannister) and one black eye… and Daenerys' eye color is described as to be so purple it's practically black. Last but not least,"" although admittedly

The biggest reason for this theory seems to be Tyrion's prominence in the story, even when he flees King's Landing at the end of A Storm of Swords, and essentially leaves the ""Game"" for quite some time. Besides, the next most obvious Targaryen candidate is Aegon (more on him below), who only showed up in the most recent book, and has had no point-of-view chapters.

On the other hand

**What Is Varys' Deal?**

We all know what Littlefinger wants –- power. But what about the eunuch Varys? He does at least as much political maneuvering as Littlefinger, how does he plan to help the people?

Arya hears him plotting with Illyrio Mopatis in GoT, theoretically giving Viserys a cavalry of barbarians (we all know ho that worked out, but still). He also helped warn Daenerys that Robert had sent assassins after her. More importantly, Varys is reportedly the person who apparently spirited Prince Rhaegar's infant son Aegon VI out of Westeros to be raised by Illyrio. It seems quite obvious that Varys is a Targaryen supporter, albeit one that realized King Aerys was too mad to rule. The real question is whether Varys truly puts the smallfolk ahead of Targaryen rule –- and if it comes down to Aegon or Daenerys, who would he pick? [for more](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/53705-adwd-spoilers-the-varys-illyrio-conspiracy/)

**Is Aegon VI Real?**

The biggest gamechanger in A Dance with Dragons was the supposed arrival of Aegon, and spirited Aegon away. Illyrio has spent time and money raising Aegon in secret, educating him to be the best king possible, having him work with the people and experience life as a commoner so he'll be sympathetic to the plight of the smallfolk. If Varys' (and Illyrio's) real goal is to help the people, building a king from the ground up is a pretty smart move.

Certainly, and 2) they really want Tyrion to be that third head of the dragon. However, Aegon being real makes the most sense. This theory explains all the reasons, but most of all, Daenerys' prophetic dream about Rhaegar saying the dragon has three heads? In it, he names his infant Aegon, and explains the child is one of the heads. It would be an odd thing for a prophetic dream to get wrong. And last but certainly not least. Varys tells the dying Kevan Lannister that Aegon VI is real

There's a more elaborate theory here, tried to take over the throne, and was outlawed and (supposedly) destroyed. GRRM has been discussing the Blackfyre rebellion in his ""Dunk and Egg"" short stories, but whether that means the Blackfyre line will play a part in the ASoIaF books remains to be seen.

**Was Balon Greyjoy Murdered?**

The king of the Iron Islands is currently Euron Greyjoy, his brother Euron coincidentally arrives even though Balon had exiled him and there's no way he should have been able to know about Balon's death. The leading theory is that Euron, who had been sailing and pirating in the East, hired a Faceless Man to assassinate his brother, making it look like an accident (their specialty). He had the means, the motive and the opportunity. Plus, the old prophet woman known as the Ghost of High Heart says, waiting on a bridge that swayed and swung. On his shoulder perched a drowned crow with seaweed hanging from his wings."" So most fans believe it's pretty much a lock.

**Is Syrio Forel Alive?**

Everyone wants Syrio Forel, he doesn't die ""on page,"" so to speak — he sends Arya away, and takes on the armed Lannister guards sent to capture Arya with a wooden training sword. It's dire, but Syrio is the First Sword of Braavos, so it's not completely unreasonable to imagine he still beat the guards, and then went on his merry way. But given that Syrio is Braavosi, who takes an odd interest in Arya and who can also magically change his face, but for no known reason. Still

**What Is Jaqen H'ghar Doing?**

When Jaqen leaves Arya (with the Braavosi coin and the phrase ""valar morghuli, who –- in the guise of the Alchemist, the face Arya saw him change into –- murders the novice Pate at the Citadel… the same Citadel where Sam Tarly has gone to become a Maester and research the Others… and who meets the same Pate, alive and well. So Jaqen is definitely at the Citadel. Seeing as the Citadel is the most learned place in the world, it seem Jaqen is trying to learn something… or prevent someone else from learning something. The real question is if he's working for someone specific, or on behalf of all the Faceless Men? [For more](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/32010-syrio-neither-dead-nor-jaqen/)

**What Was the Real Reason for Robert's Rebellion?**

There's no real easy way to summarize the amazing fan theory usually referred to as ""Southron Ambitions, Ned's father, may have had a grand plan to unite the kingdoms against the Targaryen rule on his own, creating relationships with House Tully Baratheon, Arryn, and even House Lannister in preparation for this war. It all went to hell when Rhaegar stole Lyanna and Aerys burned Rickard and Ned's brother Brandon alive, but seriously, and prepare to have your mind blown.

1350674256.0,11rgi4,A realization about Dany (Spoilers All),doctork91,471,78,175,"I think I just realized why Dany was so lame in ADWD. Ever since the death of Kahl Drogo and the birth of her dragons Dany has been been coasting on the promise of power that the dragons will be. What she's gotten she has gotten because of the dragons potential has made people either want to gain her favor or try to trick her so they can take or buy the dragons. 

On that promise of power alone she has accomplished quite a lot. She has raised armies and conquered cities. However I think that in ADWD she began to lose steam. She was ruling a city with nowhere to really go from there. There was an army sieging her. The Meerenese resented her. They did not care about her dragons. They saw them locked up and knew Dany was afraid to set them loose. Dany's ability to milk her dragons for extra favor and control had run out. 

I think her last scene where she is with Drogo and meets the Dothraki is incredibly significant. She has finally ridden her dragon. That scene signifies that Drogo has moved past being a potential power. He now is a great power. The Dothraki will respect that power and therefore Dany. They did not respect her as a Kahlessi before because she was not stronger than them. Sure she had dragons but she couldn't yet ride them. 

""A kahl who cannot ride is no kahl."" 

Now that she can ride her dragons she is the baddest Dothraki out there. She can fill her khalasar with Dothraki warriors. She then can use Drogo and her new warriors to beat off the siege and once again be the badass we know and love. She got so much done with only baby dragons.

For the first 9 episodes of the show, and why he enjoys them. The boyish glee and ""acting"" that Ramsay does was definitely creepy, but it never felt right to me. They made him seem too in control of his emotions, almost *too* cunning and smooth... I don't know.

**Excerpts of Old Nan's Stories:**

1. The wildlings were cruel men, stole girl children in the dead of night, and drank blood from polished horns. And their women lay with the Others in the Long Night to sire terrible half-human children.


2. Old Nan told him a story about a bad little boy who climbed too high and was struck down by lightning

3. “Oh, “what do you know of fear? Fear is for the winter, my little lord, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep and the ice wind comes howling out of the north. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides its face for years at a time, and little children are born and live and die all in darkness while the direwolves grow gaunt and hungry, and the white walkers move through the woods.” 
 
     “You mean the Others

      “The Others, and kings shivered and died in their castles even as the swineherds in their hovels. Women smothered their children rather than see them starve, and cried, and felt their tears freeze on their cheeks.” Her voice and her needles fell silent, and she glanced up at Bran with pale, filmy eyes and asked, “So

     “Well, only  …” 

     Old Nan nodded. “In that darkness, dead things, that hated iron and fire and the touch of the sun, and every creature with hot blood in its veins. They swept over holdfasts and cities and kingdoms, felled heroes and armies by the score, riding their pale dead horses and leading hosts of the slain. All the swords of men could not stay their advance, and even maidens and suckling babes found no pity in them. They hunted the maids through frozen forests
 
     Her voice had dropped very low
 
     “Now these were the days before the Andals came, who had taken these lands from the children of the forest. Yet here and there in the fastness of the woods the children still lived in their wooden cities and hollow hills, and the faces in the trees kept watch. So as cold and death filled the earth, the last hero determined to seek out the children, in the hopes that their ancient magics could win back what the armies of men had lost. He set out into the dead lands with a sword, a horse, a dog, until he despaired of ever finding the children of the forest in their secret cities. One by one his friends died, and came silent on his trail

4. In that darkness, dropping her voice lower and lower. Cold and dead they were, and they hated iron and fire and the touch of the sun, and every living creature with hot blood in its veins. Holdfasts and cities and kingdoms of men all fell before them, as they moved south on pale dead horses, leading hosts of the slain. They fed their dead servants on the flesh of human children…

5. “There was a knight once who couldn’t see,” Luwin said as he marked numbers in a book. “When he lost his eyes, he put star sapphires in the empty sockets, or so the singers claim.

6. “Old Nan says the children knew the songs of the trees

7. Though Old Nan did not think so, lifting her head and sniffing. She was near blind and could not see the comet, yet she claimed she could smell it. “It be dragons, boy,” she insisted.


8. “Please.” She remembered a story Old Nan had told once


9. The nightfires had burned low, she had heard Old Nan call them once, spirits returning to their graves. And Renly one of them now, gone like his brother Robert, like her own dear Ned.

10. Old Nan told scary stories of beastlings and shapechangers sometimes. In the stories they were always evil. “I’m not like that

11. “Wildlings come over the Wall or through the mountains, Old Nan used to say. The Night’s Watch isn’t so strong as it was in Brandon’s day or Queen Alysanne’s, so more get through. The places nearest the Wall got raided so much the smallfolk moved south, into the mountains or onto the Umber lands east of the kingsroad. The Greatjon’s people get raided too, but not so much as the people who used to live in the Gift.”

12. “There are abandoned castles along the Wall, Old Nan had called them.

13. It was the end of the world

14. “Some say he was a Bolton, Flint, or Norrey. Some would have you think he was a Woodfoot, from them who ruled Bear Island before the ironmen came. He never was. He was a Stark, the brother of the man who brought him down.” She always pinched Bran on the nose then, he would never forget it. “He was a Stark of Winterfell, and who can say? Mayhaps his name was Brandon. Mayhaps he slept in this very bed in this very room.” No, but he walked in this castle


15. “It was not for murder that the gods cursed him, and that the gods cannot forgive.”


16. The sentinels never left the Wall. But there might be other ghosts in the Nightfort, with never a sound to tell you where he was except for the drops of blood that fell from his axe and his elbows and the end of his wet red beard. 

    Or maybe it wasn’t Mad Axe at all, but afterward when they told their Lord Commander every description had been different. And three died within the year, and the fourth went mad, and a hundred years later when the thing had come again, the ’prentice boys were seen shambling along behind it, all in chains. That was only a story, though. He was just scaring himself. There was no thing that comes in the night, it was gone from the world now


17. The Titan of Braavos. Old Nan had told them stories of the Titan back in Winterfell. He was a giant as tall as a mountain,” Nan would end, and Sansa would give a stupid squeak. But Maester Luwin said the Titan was only a statue, and Old Nan’s stories were only stories.

The thought first came to me after the Hound's trial by combat versus Beric Dondarrion.

In that chapter, represented by Beric).  He comes from the 'throne' and after some talking the battle begins.  Beric drags the sword along his hand and ignites it with his blood.  Gendry comments that it's not wildfire causing the flame, it's magic.  The battle ends and the sword is broken.

From this scene I gather that a) the magic of the Red God can be used to light a sword ablaze b) the Old Gods and the Red God are not exactly antithetical and c) lesser swords may break from the heat.

But I wonder what would happen if you lit a Valyrian sword ablaze in a similar fashion?  Surely it would not break from the heat

Later in the book, and now that sword is red.**  [Wasn't there another sword tempered for the second time by a lion?](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lightbringer)

Now Gendry.  I don't believe that his character will serve no purpose.  Arya has made plenty of friends, he was just an apprentice when we last saw him, but he's by now had plenty of experience with the brotherhood without banners; a brotherhood devoted to the Red God, I'll add; a brotherhood in possession (through Brienne) of this one-of-a-kind red Valyrian steel blade, I will also add.

There are also signs in dreams, characters are converging around it, and a sword which is thus far compatible with dreams and ancient prophecy alike is right there in the middle of it.  I think this is enough to warrant the assumption that Ice and Fire will become one in the Red Sword of Heroes, Lightbringer.

*edit 2: I will grant that it is very possible Gendry is not involved in the forging of the sword.  Even so,False,self,t5_2r2o9,1364334992.0,,empty,t3_1b27te

Introduction
-

In my first two posts analyzing Robb Stark as a military commander, I want to amend my initial thesis. Robb Stark was **not** the worst strategist of the War of the Five Kings. Balon Greyjoy has that dubious distinction. 

Rather, not a teenager. Even the concept of a teenage wartime leader has a historical basis. One of the more famous examples is [Baldwin IV]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldwin_IV_of_Jerusalem) who defeated Saladin at the Battle of Montgisard at the age of 16. So Robb, as a boy commander, isn’t without some historical parallel. I’ll still argue that Robb’s strategy was poor, but I’ll try to give the boy a little bit of slack.

Unclear and Unconcise: Robb’s Intent
-

&gt; “If words of command are not clear and distinct, if orders are clear and the soldiers nevertheless disobey, then it is the fault of their oficers.” - Sun Tzu

So while Robb and Brynden were out west defeating untested/untrained Lannister hosts and generally sacking/raiding their way from the Golden Tooth to the Sunset Sea, was left to defend the Riverlands. A major point of contention is what instructions Robb and the Blackfish left with Edmure before they departed for their merry campaign. We don't get a POV of the instructions in real-time, but when Robb and his host returned to Riverrun from the Westerlands, they made the following claim.

&gt; ""You were commanded to hold Riverrun, Chapter 14, Catelyn II*

How clear were those instructions? Let's take a quick look at how the U.S. Army plans their missions via the [Operation Order](http://www.armystudyguide.com/content/army_board_study_guide_topics/training_the_force/the-operation-order-opord.shtml). Now, I will point your attention to Paragraph III, Execution and specifically to the first sub-paragraph: **Intent** defined as ""A stated vision that defines the purpose of an operation and the end state."" This is an ancient concept, not a modern one. Intent is the key to communicating purpose and end-state to subordinate leaders like Edmure Tully. Was Robb's intent briefed to Edmure? I don't think so.

&gt;  ""Lord Stannis was about to fall upon King's Landing

&gt;Edmure looked from uncle to nephew. **""You never told me.""**

Now, [The Riverrun Decision](http://towerofthehand.com/blog/2013/06/06-riverrun-decision/index.html) Stefan Sasse makes the following statement:

&gt; A lord is sworn to defend all his subjects, Edmure takes his oath seriously. He can be no lord if he hides behind the castle walls, a point that is made through the series time and time again, because he would violate his oath and be seen as a coward, which is nothing a lord could stand for if he ever wants to command respect and obedience among his vassals.

This point rings true to me. Lacking a clear, Edmure was able to successfully repulse assault after assault by Tywin Lannister and Gregor Clegane. He also utilized his key assets wisely, holding his heavy lance in reserve and placing scorpions and archers at key terrain points to kill enemy soldiers at their most exposed point (crossing the river). The effect was that the Lannisters were thrown back, key Lannister lords were killed and the Riverlands were safe. All was well until Robb and the Blackfish arrived back in Riverrun...

For his actions, was for Tywin and his host to pass through the Riverlands.

&gt; ""We planned to run Lord Tywin a merry chase up and down the coast, Chapter 14, Catelyn II*

Well, y'know, fuck up your plan by blocking Tywin Lannister's westward advance...**

Final point on Edmure/Robb: It's very possible that the 'merry chase' strategy was one that was thought up by Robb Stark and Brynden Tully to guilt Edmure into marrying one of the Frey girls to re-cement the shattered Frey/Stark alliance. Robb, Robb shattered the alliance with the Freys. Without the Freys, Robb saw no pathway to victory. So the theory is that Robb Stark and Brynden Tully left for the Westerlands without much of a strategy and then retroactively came up with this grand strategy, casting all the blame at Edmure's feet, so as to force him into marrying a daughter of Walder Frey. To me, this is plausible but not wholly convincing. I do think that the merry chase strategy was decided from the outset or fairly early on. I don't think it was communicated **at all** to Edmure. And lest we forget, it wasn't Robb who suggested Edmure's marriage.

&gt; ""We must win back the Freys, however small. Without them, I see no hope. I am willing to give Lord Walder whatever he requires... apologies, honors, lands, gold... there must be *something* that would sooth his pride...""

&gt; ""Not something

Deadly Friends: Roose Bolton
-

&gt; ""Treason is like diamonds; there is nothing to be made by the small trader."" - Douglas Jerrold

From the start of the northern rebellion, we all know how it turns out, but I want to talk a little about Roose Bolton prior to the Red Wedding, when he turned on Robb and how inattentive senior leadership on Robb's part played a decisive role in letting Roose operate the way he did.

So, he was no longer being commanded by Robb Stark. When Robb left for the Westerlands, he fell under Edmure Tully's command. Edmure Tully then ordered Roose Bolton to re-take Harrenhal which he did by bribing Vargo Hoat and the Brave Companions to turn cloak on the Lannisters. 

All was well until Roose Bolton sensed that Robb Stark was losing and then switched sides

&gt; ""I think it stands to reason that Roose sent those Stark-loyalists against Tywin knowing full-well what the likely result was. Due to his lack of morals or misgivings or loyalty, retreating after seeing a full 33% of his host get chopped up.""

Was Roose killing off loyal Stark bannermen in an attempt to position himself for the future? I actually kind of think is plausible. Roose's orders were to block Tywin's advance into the Riverlands so that Robb and his main host could attack Riverrun. Instead, losing a lot of soldiers, but few to none (as /u/indianthane95 points out) of his own Dreadfort men. GRRM, himself, is a [bit opaque](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Roose_Bolton) on the subject itself, though he seems to hint at Bolton's treason from the get-go. 

Besides failures of communicating his intent, for instance, served under Ned Stark and Robert Baratheon at the Battle of the Trident. So, it stands to reason that Robb would have little reason not to trust in their ability. And yet, Robb's generals go badly mismanaged. From Edmure in the Riverlands (lack of clear intent) to Roose at Harrenhal, Robb just sort of lets them do their thing. And for a while it works. The Riverlands aren't the focus of Robb's campaign in ACOK. Edmure and Roose's efforts are a sideshow, so Robb doesn't need to really need to manage his subordinates

This is a pretty serious error on Robb's part as we'll see with the Disaster at Duskendale and Roose Bolton. And before we move too much further along, he gave him a wide berth, and by wide berth, I mean the widest. No orders, no commands, no recall for (intentionally) mismanaging the war. These types of decisions that are essential for an Army commander to make were simply *not* made. 

So, a strategic point located northeast of King's Landing. They are set upon by Randyll Tarly and Gregor Clegane who wipe the Northern host out. We, as readers, are initially led to believe that this was all Robett Glover's doing, but eventually we find out that the disaster was implemented and planned by Roose Bolton, who by this point has fully turned cloak. **Small theory**: in addition to simply putting Glover and Tallhart in a position to die, Roose informed the Lannisters of the location and direction of the attack which allowed Clegan and Tarly to plan the best terrain for their attack and fully rout the northerners. 

After being summoned to the Twins for Edmure's marriage
 
Strokes of Brilliance at the End 
-

&gt; “So long as Theon Greyjoy sits in your father’s seat with your brothers’ blood on his hands, win back Winterfell, and hang Theon in a crow’s cage to die slowly. Or else put off that crown for good, Robb, for men will know that you are no king at all.” - *ASOS, Chapter 14, Catelyn II*

A point I didn’t bring up in the previous installments is how impossible Robb’s strategic picture was. Having (foolishly in my opinion) dispatched his closest friend Theon to the Iron Islands to bring the Greyjoys into an alliance

But more to the point, and let's face it, the Riverlands weren't a part of the Kingdom of the North originally and served only to broaden the territory Robb was forced to defend. Read more [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1f3le7/spoilers_all_asoiaf_debate_series_2_robbs_choice/). But I digress.

At the start of ASOS, Gregor Clegane is in Duskendale and a new host is being formed by Devan Lannister in the Westerlands (ASOS, Tyrion III). At this point, Robb finally sees the precariousness of his situation and opts to move back north to retake the north from the Ironborn. In this, we see strokes of tactical brilliance again. Robb's would attack Moat Cailin from two sides and would re-conquer the north, but that was not meant to be. Realizing he needed the Freys again, he attempted to re-secure the alliance through Edmure's marriage. The Red Wedding followed.

Another reason, eg. Arianne and the sand snakes, say that he does nothing, he thinks too much, he only delays, he is feeble. In his ADWD chapter, Areo Hotah notes that half the Dornish lords want to go to war and that they think that Doran is weak. Harry Strickland (Golden Company) later notes that Doran is ""scared of his own shadow. Not what you call daring.""

However

&gt; I have worked at the downfall of Tywin Lannister since the day they told me of Elia and her children. It was my hope to strip him of all that he held most dear before I killed him

And in ADWD when talking with the sand snakes:

&gt; I am not blind, feeble. Your father knew me better. Oberyn was ever the viper. Deadly, dangerous, unpredictable. No man dared tread on him. I was the grass. Pleasant, complaisant, sweet-smelling, swaying with every breeze. Who fears to walk upon the grass? But it is the grass that hides the viper from his enemies and shelters him until he strikes. Your father and I worked more closely than you know … but now he is gone. The question is

The grass comparison makes it clear that Doran only feigns to be an insipid ruler. In AFFC, and sometimes... Sunspear wearies me, with its noise and dirt and smells. As soon as my duty allows, I mean to return to the Water Gardens."" But this talk of duty is nonsense of course, since Doran has been planning for many years to take revenge on the Lannisters  - a plan which has recently come into its main phase when Tyrion decided to send Myrcella to Dorne and to give the Dornish a seat on the small council. He is already actively executing this plan, which he had so long desired to do, at the moment he has this conversation with Arys. 

So what game does Doran play? He presents himself as a frail prince, people see that he is doing nothing and think he is not much of a threat whereas he is in secret hatching various schemes and forging alliances wherever they can be found, to further strengthen his position. And now the viper that is Dorne is ready to strike from the grass.

**V. Knights in Shining Armor**

[The previous post in this series](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1dmz7p/spoilers_all_brienne_and_jaime_an_indepth/) demonstrated how Brienne's relationship to Jaime subverts the typical male/female relationship in Westeros. Jaime gave Brienne a sword and a fight instead of roses and kisses. For Brienne

Another way their relationship subverts gender roles is that Brienne and Jaime have taken turns playing the rescuing knight and maiden to be rescued. At first

&gt;Armed men lined both sides of the brook... “Well met

&gt;“Seemed to me she was doing the chastising.” (ASOS 21/Jaime III)

Later:

&gt;After the second time he fell from the saddle, “and what a lovely sight they are. ‘Twould be cruel to separate the good knight and his lady....Ah, but which one is the knight and which one is the lady?” (ASOS 31/Jaime IV)

And:

&gt;The eyelid was swollen

&gt;“A wench’s gift.”

&gt;“Rough wooing

&gt;“This wench is bigger than me and uglier than you. You’d best see to her as well. She’s still limping on the leg I pricked when we fought.”

&gt;“I will ask after her. What is this woman to you?”

&gt;“My protector.” Jaime had to laugh

Then Jaime does take on the chivalric role of male protector by preventing Brienne from being raped by the Bloody Mummers (ASOS 31/Jaime IV) and rescuing her from the bear in the pit (ASOS 44/Jaime VI). But what distinguishes Brienne and Jaime's relationship from the knight/maiden trope is that they are essentially equal. They've each in turn assumed the role of rescuer and rescued: Brienne saved Jaime from being recaptured by the Starks. Jaime prevented Brienne from being raped. Brienne kept Jaime's spirits up after he lost his hand. Jaime rescued Brienne from the bear pit. Brienne goes off to redeem Jaime's honor. This basic equality was evident when each (amuthingly) kept trying to protect the other in the bear pit:

&gt;“What are you doing here?”

&gt;“Something stupid. Get behind me.” He circled toward her

&gt;“You get behind. I have the sword.”

&gt;“A sword with no point and no edge. Get behind me!” (ASOS 44/Jaime VI)

Afterwards

&gt;“Her name is Brienne, I hope?”

&gt;Her broad homely face turned red. “Yes.”

&gt;“Oh

There's always been some mockery mixed in with Jaime's 'flirting'. He behaved similarly to Catelyn Stark while he was a prisoner of war. But at a certain point

&gt;The wench looked ridiculous

After that moment of honesty and intimacy (Jaime bares pretty much everything to Brienne) in the bathhouse

&gt;“Blue is a good color on you

To be clear: this isn't simply a case of 'shipping Brienne and Jaime. I think their changing relationship is significant for their character development. Brienne's growing regard for Jaime, a naive idealist, has changed his attitude towards knighthood in a positive direction. 

Just as he used to defend Cersei from rude remarks

&gt;Jaime’s golden hand cracked him across the mouth so hard the other knight went stumbling down the steps. His lantern fell and smashed, ser. Call her by her name. Call her Brienne.” (AFFC 27/Jaime III)

Jaime is so disgusted by Ser Ronnet that he ""charged Red Ronnet with the task of delivering Wylis Manderly to Maidenpool

Contrast the above to the deterioration of Jaime's feelings toward Cersei. Back at the beginning of their journey,' he warned her"" ASOS 1/Jaime I). But in the Harrenhal baths, Jaime compares her favorably to Cersei ""Brienne caught him before he could fall. Her arm was all gooseflesh...but she was strong, and gentler than he would have thought. Gentler than Cersei,"" (ASOS 37/Jaime V). Unlike Cersei, Jaime can rely on Brienne, who is kinder and more selfless. Their relationship is *far* less one-sided.

-------------------------------------------
**VI. Warrior

In AFFC

&gt;Of late, but these days he seemed to mislike everything his sister did (AFFC 16/Jaime II)

Besides comparing her unflatteringly to King Robert

&gt;The green light of the wildfire had bathed the face of the watchers, but some of the corpses were prettier than others. Even in the baleful glow, Cersei had been beautiful to look upon (AFFC 16/Jaime II)

And:

&gt;Cersei had never taken kindly to being balked

Maybe falling out of love with Cersei was inevitable. Jaime's journey with Brienne has changed him so much that even self-absorbed Cersei has noticed:

&gt;""...What did they do to you?”

&gt;“They cut off my hand.”

&gt;“No

Jaime himself feels like a different man. He's lost everything that made him who he is:

&gt;...Half the court no longer seemed to know him. I am a stranger in my own House. His son was dead, after that first day in the royal sept where Joffrey lay amongst the candles. (ASOS 67/Jaime)

The cooling of Jaime's relationship with Cersei is connected to the evolution of his relationship to Brienne. Her idealism about knighthood has actually rubbed off on the cynical Jaime--a change that irritates the hell out of Cersei

&gt;[Jaime] Once a man puts on that cloak

&gt;[Cersei] “It certainly changed you

The twins have become estranged from each other. Remember that Jaime joined the Kingsguard for Cersei

&gt;He was your twin, ...Once, perhap...No longer. He has become a stranger to me. (AFFC 12/Cersei III)

And she has become a stranger to him:

&gt;I thought that I was the Warrior and Cersei was the Maid

Embracing knighthood has distanced Jaime not only from Cersei

**See No Evil - Waymar Royce**

- Figuratively blind to the threat of the Others until it is too late

- Literally blinded when his sword shatters

Relevant quote:

&gt; When the blades touched

&gt; A scream echoed through the forest night, shrieking, and covered his eyes. Blood welled between his fingers. 

**Hear No Evil - Gared**

- Literally lacks ears from frostbite

- As far as we know, he does not hear the Others because we know they make no sound when moving. I acknowledge Gared is kind of a tougher fit than the other two.

- You could kind of stretch it and say that Gared dies because Ned is deaf to his warnings. 

Relevant quotes:

&gt; “Can’t you feel it?” Gared asked. “Listen to the darkness.” 

Courtesy of /u/Petycus

&gt; ""The poor man was half mad. Something had put a fear in him so deep that my words could not reach him.""

**Speak No Evil - Will**

- Consciously decides not to warn Waymar when the Others appears and remains silent 

- Strangled to death

Relevant quotes:

&gt; Will’s voice abandoned him. He groped for words that did not come. It was not possible.

...

&gt; They emerged silently from the shadows, never heard them. Will had to call out. It was his duty. And his death, if he did. He shivered, and hugged the tree, and kept the silence.

Its got a similar ripple/banding effect on the surface AND the method to its production has been lost to time. It's supposed to be shatter resistant and can maintain a sharp resilient edge.

It originated in the 3rd century in India/Sri Lanka where it was manufactured and shipped over to Persia and Middle East (the former being were it got it's name and popularity). Geopolitical upheavals along trade routes are commonly thought to be the reason for its decline in production.

Contemporary attempts at reproduction have been somewhat successful (depending on who you ask of course). One can purchase [novelty Damascus knives](http://www.damascusknifestore.com/index.html) that replicate the look of Damascus Steel

**Technical info ahead**

There are three promising methods to reproducing the steel though:

* The Wadsworth/Sherby method [paper here

This method uses a type of Russian steel called bulat (1.6% Carbon). The bulat is subject to a long heat treatment (15 hours) at a temperature of 1150 °C

* The Moran method:

I can't find any detailed info online on this method but according to this [Washington Post article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/14/AR2006021402058.html) it was developed by William F Moran. He welded three layers of iron and steel together then folded it in on itself, pdf warning](http://www.americanbladesmith.com/uploads/file/Testing/MS%20Test%20FINAL%204-24-2010.pdf)

* The Verhoeven/Pendray method [paper here

Using wootz steel (1.5% carbon, folding the steel in on itself then hammering it out. Each stage was also repeated for a number of cycles (ranging from 5 to 17 cycles). See Table 4 in the referenced paper for the details.

1341359054.0,w077d,Anyone else think AFFC was massively underrated?,PrivateMajor,461,102,216,"** ***Edit

A friend of mine warned me that I would not like AFFC, so I was understandably worried as I began the read.

Three re-reads later, the character development, the mysteries, the hints, and the political intrigue.  These are thing AFFC has in ample supply.

Even more than the missing chapters from some of their favorite characters, her chapters are subtly handled; it's easy to cast her aside as a madwoman or an idiot, but GRRM implies throughout it all that the core of Cersei's motivation is fear. She fears for her only son and daughter, she fears for her own safety and the safety of her house, and her throne. The pillars of her world have been pulled from under her: the rock that was Tywin Lannister lies rotting on a bier, and her brother/lover Jaime has changed, in her mind, she mistakes folly for genius

The other reason people seem to mislike AFFC is Brienne of Tarth. In terms of the number of chapters and page time given, the subjective dislike of Cersei and Brienne have a very significant impact on the opinions of Feast at-large. However, Brienne's story, despite being full of what Jaime calls ""bleating,"" contains the larger portion of action in the entire book. Jaime is forced to fight his battles with wits and words instead of steel, and aside from the Ironmen, the rest of the realm is winding down from the war and fighting grows less frequent. Mileage may vary, and there is a brutal grimness to her chapters that suggests that Westeros will get worse before it gets better.

Jaime is at his best in AFFC, than his chapters in ASOS. It is in Feast where Jaime truly begins to change. Tyrion's mocking words at the end of Storm haunt him to the extent of rebuffing his sister, and as her attitude abruptly changes toward him, his own changes toward her as well. His struggle is largely personal, as he has to contend with the demons of his past while at the same time relying on them to keep him alive; the very reputation that he loathes is, right now, the only thing staying the blades of so many people who would see him dead

AFFC also features Littlefinger at his best, capable young adult is astonishingly well handled. Samwell Tarly advances the master-plot of the Prince that was Promised and gives a quick look at the developing understanding of events to come, and the focus on the Ironmen, as well as a much-needed look at Dorne rounds out A Feast for Crows as one of the more comprehensive entries in the series, despite the exclusion of Jon, Tyrion and Dany.

I'm still at a loss as to what people expected from Feast; no

Feast is a worthy entry in the series, the hints and snapshots we get of the larger events, the development of the characters and the overall tone of loss in this book are not the flashy, quippy, action-packed events of ACOK. Nor are they the epicly brutal events of ASOS. This is a book about the victors licking their wounds, the losers facing their fate, and those who have been left untouched preparing for worse.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/w077d/anyone_else_think_affc_was_massively_underrated/

Good morning fellow crows

By now

Back in January when they came to us with this promotion

I mean come on. Aren't we ALL already exited for The Winds of Winter? Is there *seriously* anyone out there who can say that they weren't after reading the final chapters in ADWD? So what the fuck is this promotion for then? It's a vehicle for the publishing company to lure new readers in through some bullshit viral campaign simply to increase profits. 

Obviously I'm not against companies making profits. But what I am against is companies using /r/asoiaf to do it. We complain and debate about individual users monetizing /r/asoiaf and yet we don't bat an eye when large corporations do?

This whole post belongs in /r/HailCorporate because the boys were all played for fucking fools. Hell

So now here we are. We get to see vague references to these chapters until TWOW actually comes out. Do you think any of the guys who read the chapters wanted to discuss a new spoiler scope for them? Or a policy on what to do about other people repeating the stuff that the mods wrote? Does that violate the NDA? 

The guys rightly assumed I'd be pissed when I woke up and logged on to check in on things as I do every morning. They knew I'd just remove the post and force another discussion on the undecided details if they did it during daylight hours on the east coast. So what did they do? They made sure to post it when they knew I was done for the night. 

Finally, PrivateMajor, jmk, TPOG, and rabble have been throughout this entire discussion. I thought we were all rational adults and could talk about things that affect the community. Instead, once the idea of belonging to a special secret club of ""elite moderators"" (so not my words. Guess which mod said *that*.) took hold, trying to have a rational discussion wasn't possible. 

I don't lump dipotassium and gh5 in as they're new hires and couldn't be involved in this process in the first place. (Though the few times they've chimed in on mod mail discussions leads me to believe they'd stand with the guys who've read the chapters.)

So that's it, realize the damage this has done to our community and boycott this entire debacle.

Yours

Jen_Snow

It's obvious why Theon is constantly thinking that-- his time as Reek made him scared of having the wrong name

What struck me about this is actually something I realized about Arya-- they consistently ask her who she is. And she is no one. The whole point of the Faceless Men is to forget your name. And that's what Arya is doing. Yeah

So

We know Ser Justin Massey has been sent to hire sellswords in Braavos. We also know Ser Justin is a bit less bold and frontal than most knights. We know that Ramsay Bolton is a monster. And I'm fairly sure Justin knows that. 

My theory-- Arya's return to Westeros will be as an acolyte assigned to kill Ramsay Bolton. Ramsay is someone she does not know, who will recognize Arya Stark, even if nobody else does. And he's going to insist upon the importance of her name. 

This is how Arya Stark gets out of the FM. Because it's inevitable that she does. Arya has the wolf blood. The FM are too calm and rational about death for her. Arya is fire

1373896522.0,1ic7xm,(Spoilers All) Magister Illyrio's motives,Salacious-,419,65,199,"I know that the Blackfyre theory is very popular around these parts

So the theory goes that Illyrio has a Blackfyre wife, who is actually dead. They will get Jon Connington and the Golden Company to support this claim because the GC was created to bring the Blackfyres back to Westeros.

What bothers me is: why the hell would Illyrio ever help Viserys or Dany?? They are legitimately targaryens, they would be competition for Fake Aegon in claiming the throne. He would have killed Dany and Viserys immediately and buried them in an unmarked grave. But instead, he supports them for a year and a half? He then arranges the marriage of Dany and one of the most powerful warlords on the continent? And then, he gives her three *priceless* dragon eggs, 3 of the only 4 we know of? **Why??**

I have an alternative theory: Illyrio Mapatis is a religious fanatic

As a follower of the R'Hllor, Illyrio supports the Targaryens, ensuring that the line survives, in order to bring about the fulfillment of the prophecy. This means that he protects Aegon **and** Dany and Viserys, not knowing which one will eventually become (or give birth to) the Prince that was Promised.

In addition, and this is how Varys knows some of the best-kept secrets. There aren't 'little birds' gathering them; the red priest is able to see it like Melisandre can. This red priest foresaw that Dany would hatch dragons from the eggs, which is why Illyrio gathered them and gave them to her.

But I am missing one view of it. Everyone seems to be focused on finding evidence for the theory and sometimes speculating in what this will mean for the future in the books. This nitpicking of trying to find words and sentences that could be interpreted becomes pretty boring and turns an amazing story into a hunt for trivia and loses the focus on the story. 


I would like to propose a more poetic view of it. I believe the entire ""Song of Ice and Fire"" is a metaphor for the love between Rhaegar and Lyanna. It might become a fight of survival between Others and dragons later, and GRRM would probably find a way to bring in elements from old epic stories into his own story and supercharge them like he did with all the other old tales we can find traces of in the books.


One of the main strong arguments in the theory of R+L=J is that it bring the one strange and uncharacteristic move from Eddard and not only explains it


On top of this it fits with the described personalities of Lyanna and Rhaegar too. Lyanna is the rebellious one and would never back down if she wanted Rhaegar. And Rhaegar, and then bravely fight everything the world would throw at him just to protect it.  


And its here that I think the poetic parts of the story comes alive. Wouldnt it just be amazing that the entire Song of Ice and Fire is about two people who arent even a part of the story? I think this creates a depth thats just awe inspiring when you think of that the main characters are only featured as tales or a statue in the background.


On top of this it creates an amazing situation for when Daenerys and Jon meet. The horrible life that Daenerys had to experience with begging and being shunned her entire life is caused, violence and power that is so prominent in the story, but by love between two (and this is rare in GRRMs books) good people. Jon, the outsider and bastard, is at the same time the most high born of them all, also a twist typical for GRRM.


I am looking forward to the scene when the J and D finally meet. I believe Daenerys will first pour all her anger and hate she nurtured during her childhood over Jon as she tries to get back at the so hated Usurper and killers of her family. Then she (or in sad way, but a symbol for the love between Stark and Targaryen that could exist, even under the threat of war.


As GRRM said, and show that love can exists even in a world of hate. Maybe everyone will die in the end in an unhappy ending while we readers scream at the characters to stop being stupid and embrace the huge potential for good thats just an abstract dream of love (or spring?) in the background of the story.",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,False,,

1361017271.0,18mvd4,(Spoilers ADWD) A Certain Stark Analysis &amp; Speculation.,InflatableNipples,387,41,147,"As a character that has seen almost minimal “screen time” per se


I won’t go into too much detail about Benjen before his final ranging, he was sworn in as a brother and soon after became the First Ranger, a title that makes him well known amongst the wildings. And thus we arrive at the beginning of ASOIAF.


In the prologue of A Game of Thrones


&gt;**Three days after their arrival
&gt;
&gt;*JON

From this statement we can assume Benjen’s ranging party itself consisted of approximately five or six men. We learn the fate of two of these party members when Ghost finds Othor and Flowers in the Haunted forest when Jon and Sam swear their oath. We can safely ascertain that they were both from Benjen’s party:

&gt;**“It has been close on half a year since Benjen left us
&gt;“The forest is vast. The wildlings might have fallen on him anywhere. I’d wager these two [Othor &amp; Flowers] were the last survivors of his party
&gt;
&gt;*JON

This is further proven by Jon’s recollection of Othor:

&gt;**Jon remembered Othor; he had been the one bellowing the bawdy song as the rangers rode out.**
&gt;
&gt;*JON

This makes up three of an estimated five or six man ranging party. So what happened to the other members that went out with Benjen, rapists &amp; murderers, it shouldn’t be hard to believe that upon seeing their comrades attempt to slay the white walkers go without success and in turn leading to their deaths, they should flee with their life. It wouldn’t be the first time they have made that decision, for that’s probably how they got to the Night’s Watch in the first place – a decision between life of service, but a life nonetheless; or a certain heroic death. 

So which Night’s Watchmen can we recall that were once rangers that have fleed North of the Wall in that time frame? Oh yeah, were involved in the attempted robbery of Bran Stark south of the wall near Winterfell. As far as timings go, as we do not specifically hear of any additional patrols or rangings occurring besides Royce’s party which we definitely know who was involved and how it ended up, Stiv and Wallen being part of Benjen’s party is not too great a leap of faith to believe. Stiv’s familiarity with Benjen when encountering Bran further suggests he knew him well enough that it’s likely he was from Castle Black.

&gt;**The gaunt man [Stiv] with the grey stubbled face laughed. “The boy’s a Stark
&gt;
&gt;*BRAN

Stiv further provides evidence that he was part of Benjen’s party by his knowledge of the Others aka the white walkers.

&gt;**“You want to go back there
&gt;
&gt;*BRAN

Since at this stage there have been no other rangers that have come into contact with the Others

So if Benjen’s body wasn’t found with Othor and Flowers, however unlikely I believe that ending may be, GRRM always finds a way to shock us.

Before I continue we need a better understanding of where exactly Benjen’s party encountered the Others. Craster’s memory aids that problem. 

&gt;**“I’ve not seen Benjen Stark for three years, while women in ragged deerskins passed horns of beer, stirred the fire, and chopped carrots and onions into a kettle. 
&gt;“He ought to have passed here last year
&gt;Lord Mormont said
&gt;“Aye
&gt;
&gt;*JON

So Benjen didn’t make it quite as far north or west as Craster’s Keep or he surely would have sought shelter

Back to Benjen’s fate. Benjen was an adept swordsman, nor died. From an earlier reference, Stiv said “The boy’s a Stark, true enough. Only a Stark would be fool enough to threaten where smarter men would beg.” Which may or may not be a direct reference to Benjen’s encounter and reaction to the Others. So I don’t think he was captured either. Could he have scared them off with fire after everyone else was dead or had fled? Did he figure out a way to escape, in the hope of returning to the Wall to let everyone know of the situation at hand? My gut tells me yes, should some miracle occur in which he did survive, his first priority after escaping would be to warn the Watch.

Going back to what I said before

&gt;**Jon had a map before him on the table. He turned it so they could see. 
&gt;“Hardhome sits on a sheltered bay and has a natural harbor deep enough for the biggest ships afloat. Wood and stone are plentiful near there. The waters teem with fish
&gt;
&gt;*JON

If Jon has knowledge of this

&gt;**The fastest way to Hardhome was along the coast … from Eastwatch. The woods were thinner near the sea, and salt marshes. And when the autumn storms came howling, the coast got sleet and hail and freezing rain rather than snow.**
&gt;
&gt;*JON

Assuming Benjen was able to make it Hardhome in one piece which I very much believe he would be able to do even alone, either Benjen found passage on a trade galley venturing further north than intended, or spent enough time to build his own ship (Benjen the Builder, eh?). He certainly had enough wood and stone to do so and may have found the necessary building equipment in the ruins of Hardhome. 

Moving forward, being so close to surviving an Others ambush and battling the increasingly bad weather alone in order to let the realm know of its impending doom. We would have heard about that kind of wreckage from Cotter Pyke at some stage over his constant voyages along the coastline right? Right…?

Oh wait

&gt;**If he does return. Jon feared for Sam and Maester Aemon. Cotter Pyke had written from Eastwatch to report that the Storm Crow had sighted the wreckage of a galley along the coast of Skagos.
&gt;Whether the broken ship was Blackbird, the crew of the Storm Crow had not been able to discern.**
&gt;
&gt;*JON

This would mean that Benjen is now stranded on Skagos amidst a bunch of cannibal wildings and unicorns, I reckon shits going down and Benjen’s going to be a big part of it.

TL;DR: Benjen is just Benjen

It's also consistent with the warging development of Arya and Bran. Bran's greenseer powers begin manifesting after he's crippled and Arya learns to skinchange on command after going blind. Jon's possible training in warging while abed would fit the theme of the spirit developing only when the flesh has been taken away.

Now

1. Jon is dead and gone
2. Jon is ""dead"" but lives on through warging into Ghost
3. Jon is dead and will be resurrected through Melisandre


**The prologue featuring Varamyr pretty much confirms that Jon warged into Ghost.**

No

**Game of Thrones:** The Others and the wights are real despite the vast majority of people in Westeros believing they are simply myths. If we didn't have this prologue

**A Clash of Kings:** Magic is real and it works. This prologue serves the same purpose as the previous novel's

**Storm of Swords:** The Night's Watch is at its lowest point in history

**A Feast for Crows:**  There is a strange conspiracy afoot. The Citadel has had a hand wiping out all the dragons in the world and the dragons are tied somehow to the existence of magic. As readers we're supposed to be curious what Jaqen is doing at the Citadel

**A Dance of Dragons:**  Human warging is possible and there is life after death. That's a nice lore bonus but the key thing to remember here is where Varamyr died. He died fairly close to the Wall when he sees the wights. This is a set up for Winds of Winter. The Others have nearly reached the Wall and the realm is thrown into yet another civil war with the Second Aegon's Landing.

I mean if you had to jiujitsu Varamyr's scene into relating to warging somehow then why not Bran who actually does warg into a human being? Or Arya who used it on command to skinchange into a cat and identify the Kindly Man? What compelling evidence is there that this POV *must* be about Jon when his wolf dreams are not even growing more frequent or more intense? Just because he got stabbed?

**Melisandre sees visions of Jon turning from a man

It's weird to me that the simplest interpretation of this dream is never entertained. Those visions could just represent Jon's current wolf dreams. He's a man while awake

**What about the introduction of Borroq?**

As another poster pointed out in a different thread

Borroq threw most readers off the scent

**But Jon was stabbed fatally!**

He wasn't. He was stabbed once in the gut, possibly life threatening if not treated in time, but the other two are pretty minor. It is very common for healthy people to survive stabbings like this especially with the level of medical knowledge in ASOIAF. There are many potential candidates that could nurse Jon back to health -- black brothers with basic medical training, wildling folk healers, and maybe even maesters that came with Queen Selyse.

As mentioned before

**Ah

Perhaps he never felt it because the fourth knife never actually landed. Remember that in the same scene

And consider how many ""fake"" deaths there were in the series. Jon Connington drinking himself to death, Brienne being lynched... One of Arya's chapters ended with ""The Hound's axe took her in the back of the head"", yet clearly she's alive and her noggin isn't cleaved in half. The meticulous, accurate prose GRRM used to specify the manner in which Jon was stabbed mixed with the cryptic prose describing the fourth knife leads me to believe the final stab never came. The cold could be Jon going into shock, a common response in stab victims.

And finally

&gt; **ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY:** So why did you kill Jon Snow?

&gt;**GEORGE R.R. MARTIN:** Oh

&gt;**ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY:** Well, you know, it’s you!

&gt; **GEORGE R.R. MARTIN:** Well. I’m not going to address whether he’s dead or not. But as to why — didn’t you think the text established why they would want to assassinate him?

He was also famously dodgy about Aegon's death while simultaneously confirming his sister Rhaenys' death. Well now after Book 5 we know why. Of course there are theories that Aegon actually is dead but that's been discussed in other threads. The point is that near death scenes are a common motif in the series. In line with GRRM's closing statements about Jon's ""death"", what purpose it serves in the narrative, and what purpose it serves for the future of the character.


**Well I still think that Jon will live on as a warg in Ghost.**

Given all the points I presented above and the vast unlikelihood of it

There must be *some* indication in Jon's own development for something like this to happen. He never consciously controls his powers. He doesn't receive more wolf dreams. He doesn't receive more intense wolf dreams. There's just no foreshadowing of it in his own character

I don't think the prologue can make a case for it because of (1) how people are interpreting it is extremely narrow given that there are other wargs *in the same book* with more skill and talent at it than Jon and (2) no prologue in the previous books has been used to serve the development of just a few characters.

I have a theory of why people want to believe in the Jon=Ghost theory so strongly. A lot of people unintentionally read ASOIAF like a conventional fantasy series, and to eliminate the trope of ""main"" characters. Everybody is doing important things or on the way to doing important things. They're just doing it all in different places. It's bad writing to use a prologue to push the agenda of only 2-3 characters of a book filled with half a dozen POVs. GRRM very clearly doesn't do this with his prologues but Jon is understandably a fan favorite so he gets elevated in the eyes of many readers.

Truthfully

**What about when Jon yelled out for Ghost in his final moments? It's a parallel to when Varamyr's last thought was of his wolf One Eye as he tried to warg into him for his Second Life.**

Jon whispered for Ghost

As for Varamyr

If Jon actually warged into Ghost

Why did Jon whisper ""Ghost""? Because Jon realized that Ghost wasn't actually edgy about Borroq's boar. Ghost was trying to warn him. This is actually a parallel to Robb's final moments at the Red Wedding. Both Catelyn and Robb hear Grey Wind howling when the Red Wedding is nearly finished. Robb also whispered the name of his direwolf. Is this compelling evidence that Robb was unconsciously warging into Grey Wind? Of course not. He simply realized the real reason why Grey Wind was so acting so unruly before entering the camp.

But the war isn't over.

Daenerys Targaryen stands against Khal Jhaqo and hopes to cross the Narrow Sea this century. Littlefinger is setting up Sansa to inherit Robb's crown, while a dead baby has landed and set his sights on Storm's End.

So, the Seastone Chair, and whatever other thrones out there? Here's my official analysis and prediction.

---

First

**King Stannis** is poised to have the loyalty of much of the North, if some theories are true) is crowned as the King/Queen in the North, I don't think Stannis will keep their loyalty. He has Karhold, and a sort-of alliance with the wildlings, although the first is weak and the second is up in the air with Jon's death. He's strong now, but that strength doesn't look likely to last.

Of course

**Jon Snow** is probably the biggest wild card in the whole series right now. He could be living or dead. He might be in Ghost's skin

* He will be legitimized by Robb's decry, while the Riverlords might be torn. While he is Robb's heir, he doesn't share the Tully blood that made Robb so acceptable to the Riverlords.

* He will continue as Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. I don't really see this happening

* ...he is dead and reborn

Of course, he's definitely a contender for that title, and could be included as a third aspect of the next Dance of Dragons. Plus, we have the wildlings. They mostly like Jon, and would probably follow where he goes. They may not kneel the way that Westerosi would, but they would fight for Jon and possibly Stannis if things go on the right way.

We could also see another fighting force declare for him should the dominoes fall the right way. The Queen's Men, then he will likely have a large part of the Queen's Men on his side. The whole of them if Stannis falls in the upcoming battle.

**Sansa Stark** is in a wonderful position as far as alliances go. If Jon is not legitimized, she has claim to North and Riverlands, and through both blood (through Cat to Lysa and Robert Arryn), alliance (through Littlefinger), and possible marriage (Robert or Harry the Heir), she will have the Vale with her. It's also possible Littlefinger could maneuver some sort of plot so that Tyrion's claim to Casterly Rock is recognized through Sansa ""Lannister,"" giving her the West as well.

What would this mean? The Knights of the Vale. The Lords of Winter and River. And depending on what other alliances LF can arrange

**Rickon Stark** is also a claimant to the north. Ramsay (and possibly Roose, Stannis may either use him to cement his claim on the North, or some northern lords will act as regent for Rickon and rise for him. He's also a bit of a wild card.

Though Bran has the strongest claim of the Starks and Arya has a claim as long as Sansa's missing

Our other claimant to the north is none other than **Roose Bolton**, Winterfell might not stay in his hands for long. He currently has the cooperation of the northmen, if not their loyalty. We'll see how far that gets him, though I wouldn't count him out of the fight just yet. But we can't discuss Roose's claim as overlord of the North without disussing his king...

**King Tommen** is in a wholly different position from Stannis. He has inherited the hatred of the Lannisters by the smallfolk, Tommen has the West and Crownlands, as well as the Reach, and (officially) Dorne (as they have not declared open rebellion).

When talking of Tommen, and she may well be a head shorter after Ser Robert Strong's battle with the Faith's champion. That'll be a big factor in her power through the end of the song, but it might be for naught. Even if she wins and regains her place as regent (without any other Lannister choice), she has lost not only her respect, but her savviness.

Then it is time to talk of the younger queen, there is no one who could be considered for Tommen's regent but Mace Tyrell. The entire city is nearly void of Lannisters now, replaced by the Tyrells. Cersei once said that power was lying on a bed of thorns, ripping them out one by one before they could strangle you (possibly from the show). Well, the bed of roses is King's Landing, and Cersei is gasping for breath.

Moving from King's Landing to Storm's End

**King Aegon** is another wild card, and Dorne is ready to rise up for him. He has ""friends in the Reach,"" and is the only Targaryen in the war as of now. He may even be the only king supported by the Faith, depending on how Cersei's trial ends.

Unlike Stannis, he may turn to the Iron Isles or the North to cement his claim. But for now, his only war seems to be with the Lannister/Tyrell forces. And he seems to be making good work of them fast.

Of course

**Daenerys Targaryen**, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm, *Khaleesi* of the Great Grass Sea, called Daenerys Stormborn, the Unburnt, but her titles are pimipin'.

Some say she's slipping towards madness. Others call her outright cruel. Then there are those loyal to her, she might have a large khalasaar of the strongest cavalry in the world, the Dothraki. Depending on how the Battle of Meereen ends up, she may just have the strongest naval force in the world, the Iron Fleet, ready to bring the Unsullied and Dothraki across the Narrow Sea. Oh, and did I mention she has *mother fucking dragons*?

Still, you may have a point. But the stronger point against her would be her allies in Westeros. She may have Victarion and the hated Imp. She could forgive an heir to Bear Island, but what will that win her? Barristan the Bold might sway some to her cause, but how many? Once upon a time, we could say that she would have the Targaryen legacy to give her strength, but Aegon has already taken that card. She might have earned the Martell loyalty, but through little fault of her own

Could Dany the Conqueror defeat her adversaries and win her throne? Or should she have taken a page from Littlefinger and played the game of thrones for longer? Only time will tell. And despite the naysayers

Finally

**King Euron** is no stronger or weaker than he was a when he was crowned. He has the Iron Fleet, the Ironborn have taken the Shield Islands and have been raiding the Reach. It could be enough to sate the ironborn and keep him on the Seastone Chair should Asha contest the kingsmoot.

It's too soon to really say what another kingsmoot will mean, Theon is the least likely to don a crown.

But what of **Asha**? She will be one of the contenders for the Seastone Chair once more in a second kingsmoot

Who does? **Victarion Greyjoy**. When he returns, but that might just push him over the edge. Of course, whether he is allied with her or married to her could make a difference. Would she give him the Isles if she has help winning her throne? Or will they sit the Iron Throne together after the war? If Tyrion is part of her entourage, she could have Casterly Rock in addition to Pyke behind her. That trio would be fearsome indeed.

Then the whole kingdom believes his youngest son murders his grandson, and escapes from his cell to kill Tywin. Cersei does her very best in running the kingdom into the ground, and is disgraced and paraded naked through the city. 

After Tywin's rise to being hand of the King, and a disgraced queen. Also a fat bastard grandson who names his kittens Ser Pounce and Lady Whiskers.

**Q: The Lannisters and the Freys have so many relatives

distant relatives that could claim Winterfell?**

A: It’s true that right now the Freys and the Lannisters
have very large families. The Starks are few now. But there
were many factors to this: in the North
habitual; branches of the Starks have separated from the
main family long ago and formed their own House (the
Karstarks for example
**you have to take into account the situation at the moment:
we already know how Ned’s children are; Brandon and
Lyanna died with no children**; Benjen joined the Night’s
Watch. And there’s something else to consider: the North
is special. In the North not everyone can rule. Remember
the conversation between Robb and Cat when they are
speaking precisely of this: Cat was talking about a distant
relative from the Vale with Stark blood
can’t rule the North

**Q: Arthur Dayne has been held up as the epitome of

1375900940.0,1jwfjn,(Spoilers All) A Little Town Called Pennytree,berthok,389,53,70,"While reading ADWD I was caught up by the mention and description of Pennytree. This was where Ser Arlan of Pennytree was from in the Dunk and Egg novellas.  Here's some of the excerpts from ADWD:

    .

&gt; ...the village had a holdfast as strong as any in the riverlands

&gt; ***--Chapter 48: Page 645 - Jaime - A Dance With Dragons***

    .

&gt; Pennytree proved to be a much larger village than he had anticipated. The war had been here too; blackened orchards and the scorched shells of broken houses testified to that. But for every home in ruins three more had been rebuilt. Through the gathering blue dusk Jaime glimpsed fresh thatch upon a score of roofs, an oak ancient and tall. Its gnarled roots twisted in and out of the earth like a nest of slow brown serpents, and hundreds of old copper pennies had been nailed to its huge trunk.

&gt; ***--Chapter 48: Page 644 - Jaime - A Dance With Dragons***

    .

&gt; He tried to count the pennies nailed to the old oak

&gt; ***--Chapter 48: Page 645 - Jaime - A Dance With Dragons***

    .

The following passage is from the same chapter

    .

&gt; (Jonos) Bracken's mouth set stubbornly. 'All these lands belonged to Stone Hedge once. The Blackwoods stole them from us.'

&gt; 'What about this village here

&gt; '**Pennytree. That was ours once too

&gt; ***--Chapter 48: Page 637 - Jaime - A Dance With Dragons***

    .

We learn that Pennytree has been sworn to the crown for the past hundred years

Have we seen any other fiefs reporting directly to the crown (outside of the Crownlands)?

What sort of event had happened 'a hundred years' previous which would cause Pennytree to be taken out of the affairs of the local lords? 'A hundred years' back in history from the present ADWD year of 300 would put us in the year 200 (or thereabouts). There were a few people we know who were wandering around the world around that time. Here's a breakdown of some of the dates of note that I was able to quickly compile from the [wiki](http://awoiaf.westeros.org).

* 150 AL - Arlan of Pennytree born *(approximate year)*
* 172 AL - Aegor Rivers 'Bittersteel' born
* 175 AL - Brynden Rivers 'Bloodraven' born
* 192 AL - Duncan the Tall born *(approximate year)*
* 194 AL - Roger of Pennytree dies (Battle of the Redgrass Field)
* 194 AL - Bittersteel flees Westeros
* 200 AL - Pennytree made a royal fief *(approximate year)*
* 205 AL - Otho Bracken 'The Brute of Bracken' slays Lord Quentyn Blackwood at a King's Landing tournament
* 209 AL - Bloodraven becomes Hand to the King
* 209 AL - Arlan of Pennytree dies
* 211 AL - Beron Stark attempts to repel Dagon Greyjoy from Stony Shore
* 211 AL - Otho Bracken becomes Lord of Stone Hedge
* 211 AL - House Blackwood declares war upon Bracken to oust 'The Brute of Bracken'
* 212 AL - Second Blackfyre Rebellion at Whitewalls

I have a suspicion about it, in one way of another.

**I believe that Dunk and Egg (maybe on their way back from visiting Winterfell) stopped by Pennytree so that Dunk could finally see Arlan's origins. They find a war-torn and ragged ruin from The Brute of Bracken and the Blackwoods feuding

The only other person I can think who would be involved is Bloodraven

Bloodraven certainly had ties to want the 'teats' and what lay between

    .

&gt; 'Aegon the Unworthy took Barba Bracken as his mistress, and one day when the king was visiting at Stone Hedge he went out hunting and saw the Teats and...'

&gt; '...named them for his mistress.' Aegon the Fourth had died long before Jaime had been born

&gt; 'Lady Melissa
There's a statue of her in our godswood. She was *much* more beautiful than Barba Bracken, he...'

&gt; '...gave her Barba's teats.' Jaime laughed.""

&gt; ***--Chapter 48: Page 643 - Jaime - A Dance With Dragons***

    .

We see here a small anecdote of the ongoing opposition between Bracken and Blackwood

There's one person who probably knows the truth and history of all of it

    .

&gt; The Blackwood boy would tell him if he asked

If you are unfamiliar

Bran's final weirwood vision in DwD: 
&gt; And now the lords Bran glimpsed were tall and hard, as he watched, a bearded man forced a captive down onto his knees before the heart tree. A white-haired woman stepped through a drift of dark red leaves, a bronze sickle in her hand. ""No,"" said Bran, ""no, don't, no more than his father had. The woman grabbed the captive by the hair

Starting with Bran's weirwood visions at Winterfell. Bran's visions progress backwards, the execution scene quoted above. The first thing to clarify is the time frame: It's then pointed out that the woman has a bronze sickle. This is crucial because the First Men used bronze weapons before the Andals brought iron to Westeros 6,000 years ago. This allows us to place the execution between 8,000 years ago (the Long Night) and 6,000 years ago.

Now what Starks do we know from this era from legends and Old Nan's tales? There are very few: Bran the Builder, however, makes perfect sense considering his Stark lord brother supposedly took him down and presumably executed him. 

This is where it gets interesting. Old Nan explicitly said that she thought the Night's King name was Brandon/Bran. What if Martin's last line in Bran's weirwood vision is a double entendre? ""but as the life flowed out of him in a red tide

But there's more. This very same double entendre occurs at least one other time - when Bran first meets Coldhands north of the Wall. When Bran asks him who he is

What do we know about Coldhands? He's a black brother - the Night's King was Lord Commander. According to Leaf of the CotF, long even in CotF time (this is usually used to rule out Benjen). Finally, Coldhands is said to be wearing *chain mail armor* under his cloak. Now this is often used against Coldhands being the Night's King, the logic being chain mail only came when the Andals brought iron. However, as Bran's last visions approach the execution scene, he actually sees ""tall and hard, stern men in fur and *chain mail*."" I take this to mean that chain mail (perhaps made of bronze) existed contemporaneously with bronze weapons (the executioner's sickle) *before* the arrival of the Andals. This means that Coldhands's chain mail could feasibly come from the pre-Andal era. Or he looted it from someone he killed

And finally

I think it's all there: the execution, the double entendre (this is my favorite), the death ""long ago,"" both being black brothers and explaining the existence of a sentient wight.

For years now one of the most important rules/policies that our subreddit has had is our so-called ""Don't Be a Dick"" policy. Essentially this rule means that we crows can disagree without being disagreeable. I believe this fundamental belief has made the Wall one of the friendliest and most mature places on all of the Internet to constructively discuss all things ASOIAF related.

My fellow Maesters and I recently looked over the policy as it currently stands and decided to clarify more specifically what this rule actually means based on our years of subjectively enforcing it. What follows

***

*A violation of the Civility Policy, post titles, or user-names.*

**Being a dick means:**

* outright insults to another person (*You're an asshole, etc.)

* posting any image as a response to a comment where the image is clearly intended to be disrespectful (e.g. the Stalin *""Dear Diary

* using movie/book/TV quotes to insult someone (*""There's no cure for being a cunt.""*)

* Being condescending (*""Aren't you and your opinions just precious you sweet summer child?""*)

* Being disrespectful when telling someone they've made a mistake (*""Can't you fucking read? That fact is right in the book.""*)

**Being a dick is not:**

* blunt language where there is no intent to insult or disparage a fellow crow (e.g. *""I fucking hate

* simple disagreements (*This is the way I think it should be interpreted. This is the way it should be done. This is what it says. etc.* As compared to the dick response: *Your point of view is completely invalid because you clearly don't have the mental capacity to understand what you're doing. My way is the right way and the only way.*

* telling someone they're wrong in a respectful manner (*""You're mistaken

**VII. No True Knights**

*In the name of the Warrior I charge you to be brave.*

*In the name of the Father I charge you to be just.*

*In the name of the Mother I charge you to defend the young and innocent.*

*In the name of the Maid I charge you to protect all women...* 

&amp;#32; &amp;#822;&amp;#32; oath of knighthood (The Hedge Knight)

...

When they first start traveling together, ""wench"". The nicknames highlight how each of them is no true knight. Jaime can't leave his crime behind; it taints everything he does (""Why must they misunderstand every bloody thing he did? Aerys. It all grows from Aerys."" ASOS 62/Jaime VII). Brienne can't leave her gender behind; it limits her choices and opportunities. Her gender is even posited as the reason she supposedly killed Renly--she was lovesick or maybe (&amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;) on her period. The significance of the nicknames is foregrounded at the start of their journey:

&gt;“You will call me Brienne. Not wench.”

&gt;“My name is Ser Jaime. Not Kingslayer.”

&gt;“Do you deny that you slew a king?”

&gt;“No. Do you deny your sex? If so

Jaime has repeatedly broken his vows

&gt;...“I did not intend to give offense

&gt;“Your crimes are past forgiving

&gt;“That name again...Why do I enrage you so? I’ve never done you harm that I know of.”

&gt;“You’ve harmed others. Those you were sworn to protect. The weak

&gt;...

&gt;“Why did you take the oath?...Why don the white cloak if you meant to betray all it stood for?” (ASOS 11/Jaime II)

Brienne loathed Jaime because he has besmirched a role that she idealized:

&gt;“It is a rare and precious gift to be a knight...and even more so a knight of the Kingsguard. It is a gift given to few

&gt;A gift you want desperately, I rode with Ser Arthur Dayne against the Kingswood Brotherhood, and he knighted me on the battlefield. It was that white cloak that soiled me, not the other way around. So spare me your envy....” (ASOS 11/Jaime II)

Jaime missed Brienne's point--prowess in battle isn't the only thing that distinguishes a knight. He is also supposed to be a moral paragon. Barristan Selmy taught his squires that ""it is chivalry which makes a true knight, but it becomes apparent that this doesn't reflect his true feelings about the matter.

Brienne is also angry at Jaime because he reminds her of her own limitations and failures. Despite her efforts to be worthy of Renly's rainbow cloak

&gt;Jaime said

&gt;She would not hear it. “Aerys was mad and cruel

&gt;“I know what I swore.”

&gt;“And what you did.” She loomed above him, horse-toothed disapproval.

&gt;“Yes

&gt;...

&gt;“Tell me true, was that the way of it? Or perhaps your moon’s blood was on you. Never give a wench a sword when she’s bleeding.”

&gt;For a moment Jaime thought Brienne might strike him... (ASOS 11/Jaime II)

Brienne harped on him for having failed to keep his Kingsguard oath because she too failed to keep her Kingsguard oath. Loras directly connected her failure as a Kingsguard to her gender (""She deserves death. I told Renly that a woman had no place in the Rainbow Guard. She won the melee with a trick"" ASOS 67/Jaime VIII). Brienne failed Renly just like Jaime failed Rhaegar. Her anger at Jaime was partly a case of projection. Her scornful treatment of him was an attempt to distance herself from him

&gt;He turned abruptly and galloped back to find Brienne...The wench rode well behind and a few feet off to the side

For his part, he came to appreciate Brienne's persistence and gave her another quest to complete, one that happened to perfectly encapsulates the core values of chivalry: fulfill a holy vow to rescue and protect an innocent maid.

Jaime has come to realize the worth of the Maid of Tarth. She is brave, kind to the weak, and incorruptible--the ideal knight. This was something even Renly realized:

&gt;[Loras] “Renly thought she was absurd. A woman dressed in man’s mail

&gt;[Jaime] “If he’d ever seen her in pink satin and Myrish lace

&gt;“I asked him why he kept her close, but all that Brienne wanted was to die for him. (ASOS 67/Jaime VIII)

Brienne's purity is partly due to her naïveté. [Brienne is nearly as sheltered, Brienne has been brought up on tales of knightly valor:

&gt;“There was always a singer at Evenfall Hall when I was a girl

&gt;[Catelyn] “Sansa did the same

In a revealing conversation

&gt;“Every place has its local heroes. Where I come from

&gt;“Ser Gallawho of What?...Never heard o’ him. Why was he so bloody perfect?”

&gt;“Ser Galladon was a champion of such valor that the Maiden herself lost her heart to him. She gave him an enchanted sword as a token of her love. The Just Maid, but only thrice did he unsheathe her. He would not use the Maid against a mortal man, for she was so potent as to make any fight unfair.”

&gt;...“The Perfect Knight? The Perfect Fool

&gt;“Honor

Yet we meet Brienne while she's in the process of realizing that the songs of her childhood are bullshit. This disillusionment comes about because she is a living challenge to the social system that produced those songs. She has discovered that knights are as apt as the rest of us to engage in unworthy behavior. [Her terrible experiences with Ser Ronnet and Renly's knights of summer](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1dmz7p/spoilers_all_brienne_and_jaime_an_indepth/) taught her she could not rely on the code of chivalry to protect her. The social contract between women and men in Westerosi society--women had no rights and little freedom

&gt;I was not always wary...When I was a little girl I believed that all men were as noble as my father. Even the men who told her what a pretty girl she was,...You’ll find truth in your looking glass, not on the tongues of men.” It was a harsh lesson, one that left her weeping, but it had stood her in good stead at Harrenhal when Ser Hyle and his friends had played their game. A maid has to be mistrustful in this world, or she will not be a maid for long, (AFFC 20/Brienne IV)

Brienne's disillusionment with the songs of her girlhood was cemented by the death of Renly (the chivalric ideal for Brienne) and her journeys in ASOS and AFFC. Her travels through the riverlands showed her the things that the singers never mentioned, and suffering caused by war and gallant knights.

The chivalric system is meant to protect women, but gave her back to Vargo Hoat (ASOS 37/Jaime V). Randyll Tarly relished pointing out that Brienne would probably be raped if she continued on her quest (""Lord Randyll is of the view that you might benefit from a good hard raping"" AFFC 25/Brienne V). The hedge knights she meets on the road are either ineffectual or untrustworthy. Every armed man she encounters is a potential predator, not a protector.

She doesn't have to do anything but dote on her son.  She's rich and she gets to live in the lovely climate of Kings Landing, she poisons her husband, and drags the whole realm down the rabbit hole.  Lovely.  It all turned out so well for her too /s  If she could have just kept it in her pants, this whole damn thing might not have happened.  You got played.  Dude never even liked you but you were too blinded by your own emotions to realize it.  You crazy, ho.

Then, you had sex with a whore while you were at war like EVERY SINGLE OTHER MAN in the Seven Kingdoms?  I'm going to make both of your lives a living hell for the next 14 years, then I'm going to send him off to the Wall where I hope he freezes and dies.  I only wish she had survived until the end of the series so that she could find out about R+L=J and off herself for being such a douche to her truly faithful husband for so damn long.  Then she thinks a Lannister pushed her son out of a window.  Okay, pretty reasonable.  OBVIOUSLY it was the dwarf, who is the same damn size as the kid and probably couldn't overpower him if he wanted to.  After all, he stopped by Winterfell to pay his respects and give them plans for a saddle to help Bran ride.  Obviously he's just trying to cover up for himself, he must have done it!  Lets arrest him on the road, hun.  Now she's out prancing around being a vengeful bitch as this ""Lady Stoneheart"" character

Oh, The Mountain would have led the Lannister host west, been crushed by Robb, and Kings Landing would have fallen to Stannis.  Congratulations, you fucked up the lives of TWO kings.  If Robb comes back with the Lannister army defeated and Kings Landing in Stannis' hands, there is no way Walder Frey has the balls to pull the Red Wedding.  Robb gets to move his army north, retakes Winterfell and puts the Bastard of Bolton's head on a spike.  And we likely get to meet Howland Reed sooner as a result so we wouldn't still be left wondering about R+L=J.

Oh, but there is this.  How the hell did you let Walder Frey live so damn long?  The dude should win the award for ""worst bannerman ever"" every single effing year.  You should have Tywin Lannistered' that shit a long time ago and given the Twins to a more loyal contingent.  Then Robb wouldn't have had to agree to that idiotic wedding contract in the first place.

1341644700.0,w64za,(SPOILERS BOOKS 1-4) Was the connection between Melisandre's vision and the dragons obvious? It was just pointed out to me. ,Static_Line_Bait,401,81,133,"According to Melisandre's visions: to create a dragon you're supposed to have the blood of a king


A couple (?) of the later Targaryen kings were convinced they could be reborn as dragons (my memory is patchy on this; at least one, and drank wildfire). Aerion almost had it right... except there was no egg for his soul to pass into, and the fire was supposed to be for the egg, not him.


Three ""royal"" lives were lost fairly close to the eggs- Khal Drogo, with each death unlocking/preparing one of the eggs for hatching as per Melisandre's vision(as the soul of the deceased passed into the egg). As Daenerys herself says, two of the dragons remind her of her husband and brother... and for a very good reason.


Dragons take on characteristics of the life used to hatch them- the later Targaryen dragons were stunted and twisted due to the inbreeding and madness in the Targaryen line (or was it that the Targaryens refused to sacrifice a royal life and used only a little blood, or was it an old (and altered) tale that led him to do what he did?


(Forgive the scattered-ness and the crappy grammar


TLDR: Melisandre's late to the game, which is where the deaths of Khal Drogo, Viserys, and Rhaego come into play.

1371557767.0,1gkvyq,(Spoilers TWOW) On the accuracy of a particular letter received by one Jon Snow.,thesearmsshootlasers,408,93,236,"Let me preface by saying this stuff doesn't seem particularly clever to me

**The meta stuff**

* GRRM has already set a precedent for giving ""false positives"" in regards to characters' deaths, which leads to my next point.

* In the preview chapters for TWOW, this pattern can be easy to spot. I'm sure others noticed it earlier than me but as soon as Arianne gave her exposition in AFFC I knew it was never going to work. Stannis has not given anything away and so still has a pretty good chance of survival. The reveal will not be given in exposition, but shown in action when the battle occurs.

**The plot stuff**

* In TWOW Theon estimates Bolton will send out half of his forces, who will switch sides as soon as the battle begins or even beforehand. Additionally, as speculated in the article linked above, there is a good chance the Umbers are not divided, but working together in secret against the Boltons and will also switch sides at the time of battle. This will both bolster Stannis' army and weaken Bolton's. Add to this Stannis' plan, whatever it is, and there's a good chance the offensive against Stannis will be a blood bath

* With all this in mind, Manderley can return and give a ""false positive"" in regards to the defeat of Stannis. He's got form here, as I mentioned above. Umber could support him. A few random heads posing as friends of Stannis to be mounted on the wall and a lend of Stannis' sword and we have enough to convince Ramsay.

* The idea that Ramsay was lied to is supported by the fact that he thinks Theon has gone to wall with Jeyne. They haven't, and likely still in the possession of Stannis and not at the wall.

So, and a Manderley and Umber alliance on the inside. Ramsay thinks he is in a good position, and his cockiness in sending the letter hints at an imminent fall. He's also making a bit of an empty threat, since he's got a long and deadly cold march if he wants to reach jon and cut his heart out. Tactically, Jon would have been better off sending a raven back just saying ""Bring It"" rather than attempting to sway the Night's Watch. They likely would have even ended up fighting for him rather than turning on him if a Bolton army turned up and started attacking. A difficult battle, sure, but no harder than marching on and attacking Winterfell.

I admit I'm not sure how Mance Rayder's being revealed fits in

As I said above

1368215276.0,1e361x,(Spoilers All) Meera Reed: More than meets the eye(s)?,MikeTysonsLifeCoach,393,88,165,"*note: this theory presumes that R + L = J

I've been totally stumped when speculating on who the third head of the dragon is (assuming Dany and Jon are the first two). A lot of subtle evidence points to Aegon being fake, though, I read this quote from Alfie Allen, talking about Jon's parentage (which Martin told him the truth of):
 
""it involves a bit of a Luke Skywalker situation."" 

This could mean nothing, (and please hear me through on this), it could mean Jon has a twin sister, from whom he was separated at birth. I started checking AWOIAF and the books, and came to this:

**Meera Reed is Jon's twin sister

Pros:

* Meera was born in the same year as Robb and Jon, but we know nothing about this character except her name and that she exists (because Jojen has to come from somewhere, and I don't buy the theory that he's Howland in disguise). 
* Meera's physical description is very similar to Lyanna's and Arya's. She's slim and flat-chested
* The odds of Lyanna dying in childbirth seem more likely if she had twins.
* Howland certainly owes Lyanna a debt
* The northern houses that could propose marriage alliances with the Starks seemed to be at least interested (the Karstarks wanting to marry Alys to Robb)
* It gives the dragon a third head in a very ""neat"" way

Cons:

* The biggest hole in this theory, and no recent Targaryens have had green eyes either (1/2 of Shiera Seastar doesn't count). However, wouldn't giving Meera gray (or violet) eyes give this away way too soon? Howland Reed knows some magic thanks to his time on the Isle of Faces, and crannogmen have been described as being able to ""blend in"" to the neck. Changing her eye color to throw the readers off the scent isn't something I'd put past Martin, if he really wanted this to be a surprise.
* She doesn't show up in any of the prophecies. There's no foreshadowing or prophecy that mentions twins (AFAIK). 
* Bloodraven or the COTF might sense her importance (she's in their cave, they aren't showing it. 
* She's short (which I don't remember being particular of Lyanna)
* If she's stuck in that cave north of the wall when winter hits

So that's my theory. There is certainly solid evidence against it, rule it out. Thoughts?

So I was looking in my copy of Lands of Ice and Fire the other day and for whatever reason I happened to focus on the Summer Islands. The name of the Island that contains the Red Flower Vale is called Jhala.


This would mean that Jhalabar Xho is from Jhala; at first I thought that was stupid. I mean


What if Jhalabar is what he is called as an exile? His name is actually Xho, everyone starts calling him, ""The Jhalabar"", i.e., the guy from Jhala.


Now, ""bar"" means ""son ; as in Bar Mitzvah, or Jesus' patronymic, Bar Joseph (not actually Christ...). GRRM has gotta know this detail- the man's from the East coast...


Now, like in Westeros. My theory is that in the ASOIAF universe, ""bar"" in a name is the Valyrian way denoting bastards. 


There are two Westerosi houses with ""bar"" in their names. The first is House Bar Emmon. We know almost nothing about them, like Aegon Targareyn or Daemon Velaryon, so their house exists, but is rather small and obscure to this day. Perhaps they have the Valyrian look, but there's too little info about them to know. 


The other ""bar"" house is another Valyrian name: Baratheon. We know Orys Baratheon was a bastard. I'd venture to guess when he took the Storm Land's he agglutinated his name from Bar Atheon to Baratheon


So if ""bar"" is the Valyrian bastard modifier


He's in King's Landing now, possibly Lys. Let's say at the beginning of his exile, he goes to the Free Cities, looking for mercenaries to help him take the Red Flower Vale. The mercenary companies of Lys and Tyrosh have more pressing matters to deal with, like the Disputed Lands, so they send Xho away, not before giving him a new and disparaging nickname, or


He makes it to King's Landing to petition Party-King Robert to drink with him, which is the first step to taking back The Red Flower Vale; if he get's an army, it doesn't matter what name they call him. At that point, and especially because the Westerosi don't understand that it's a rude nickname, he's cool with being called Jhalabar. 


**tl;dr** Jhalabar Xho is not his given name- he is Xho from the Island of Jhala. If  Bar is the Valyrian bastard modifier; ""Jhalabar"" (the bastard of Jhala) is a derogatory nickname he picked up in the Free Cities. 

**edit** A couple people are asking if Jhalabar is his family name, but I'd think the evidence against it Quhuru Mo and his daughter Kojja Mo; as far as I can tell, family names come last in the Summer Islands.

Furthermore

The part that only started to make sense now is that the Wierwood Paste is so named for the fact that it turn the person consuming it into a Wierwood tree.  This is why the Three-Eyed Crow (who himself will most likely turn out to be Brynden Rivers) has lived such a long life in his suspended half-man half-tree state.  

But the Three-Eyed Crow is a character who lives in isolation

Nevertheless

Therefore, but so long as there were other living Greenseers, some living person could see through the eyes of the Wierwood tree and offer their council to those who sought it.  But as the children of the forest were killed off, and fewer and fewer were taught the gift of greenseeing, there was no way for anyone to communicate to those who came to pray to the Weirwood trees.  After a certain point those who sought the council of the Weirwood trees were no longer given answers from the Greenseers, but had their questions only answered with the silence of the forest.  The Weirwood trees, which still bear faces

EDIT: Thanks for the huge response.  Also, but it's worth reading. 

There are a number of questions over whether the Old Gods are prior to the Greenseers, but I'll offer my own speculation:

I think that the Children of The Forest had a reverence for nature before anyone discovered the gift of Green Sight.  I'd imagine that the first Greenseer was a Buddah like figure who went out to an area in the forest to mediate, is an innate power that some Children of the Forest have that somehow needs to be awakened.  

Somehow

pilinisi notes that the weir in Weirwood is linguistically similar to the were in werewolf

My guess is that this first Greenseer was sought out by others as a teacher/man of wisdom like the Buddah, the Children of the Forest would go to him or her for seeking guidance and wisdom.  After the first Greenseer became more tree than man he was worshiped by the Children of the Forest as the first God.  Later Greenseers would take the seeds of the Weirwood tree, and the blood of a sacrifice as sacrament, and go off to meditate in a new forest, where they would learn to communicate with the Old God, and the animals.

- The first thing that needs to be accepted is the Euron-Faceless Men theory

- Next, then Euron has already thought of it twice.

Alright

Euron recruited the Faceless Men to kill Balon after he escaped from the ruins of Valyria. He has plenty of riches and rare treasures, the FM have their origins in the slaves of Valyria; the last thing they want to see is the dragonlords becoming powerful again. They demand the dragon egg as payment from Euron so they can destroy it. But this is all familiar territory right? Lets move on.

Euron claims the Seastone chair due to the help of the FM, as he no longer has anything of interest to them. However, he promises them the death of dragons in return. No, not the book sitting in a vault in Oldtown, but the actual death of dragons. How? Let's take a look at Victarion and the horn that Euron sent with them.

Euron sends Vic with a horn that can control dragons to Meereen so he can claim Dany as Euron's bride. For a man who sailed into Valyria and back

- Euron sends Vic. Why would he send Vic, either by taking Dany/the Dragons as his own. 

- With such a risk of betrayal, simple, and non-convoluted. 

- It's also worth noting that ""All Euron's gifts are poisoned.""

- If Euron wants to claim a wife at all

... But wants to kill her dragons. Think about it. Why else would Euron send a person that despises him, which will in turn (1) Kill the dragons or (2) severely incapacitate them or (3) Drive them insane. Either way, the end result will still be the same: Victarion will likely die, and Rhaegal/Viserion are taken out, thus when Dany returns she will think the Iron Fleet was sent specifically to kill her dragons. She now has a reason to get her ass in gear and get to Westeros. All the while Euron sits on his throne, laughing as the alliance with the Faceless Men is secured. Also, its pretty convenient that the FM have agents ready in Oldtown right as Euron is attacking the Reach... If Euron's plan succeed I can see the FM helping him take Oldtown. This conspiring would also provide a path for Arya back to Westeros

 Also didn't Moqorro say that ""A tall and twisted thing with one black eye and ten long arms

I'll end with these quotes from Euron's wiki:

""I am the storm

""Perhaps we can fly. All of us. How will we ever know unless we leap from some tall tower? No man ever truly knows what he can do unless he dares to leap.""

...
**IX. WAR OF THE SEXES**
&gt;Each of the Seven embodies all of the Seven...There was as much beauty in the Crone as in the Maiden

Brienne didn't have to spend much time in Catelyn Stark's company before realizing that Cat was as brave as many knights (“...you have courage. Not battle courage perhaps but...a kind of woman’s courage. ACOK 39/Catelyn V). It was this courage, Catelyn tells Brienne about how motherhood is a kind of battle:

&gt;[Catelyn] “Knights die in battle”...

&gt;[Brienne] ...“As ladies die in childbed. No one sings songs about them.”

&gt;“Children are a battle of a different sort....A battle without banners or warhorns

Perhaps this idea of motherhood being its own sort of battlefield is common in Westerosi society. Randyll Tarly said something similar while trying to force Brienne to leave Renly's camp: “The gods made men to fight

Catelyn pitied Brienne's ugliness

But beauty can be a double-edged sword for women, vulnerability:

&gt;The queen’s face was hard and angry. “Would that I could take a sword to their necks myself....When we were little, there was none for me. ‘What do I get?’ I remember asking. We were so much alike, I could never understand why they treated us so differently. Jaime learned to fight with sword and lance and mace, while I was taught to smile and sing and please. He was heir to Casterly Rock, while I was to be sold to some stranger like a horse, to be ridden whenever my new owner liked, beaten whenever he liked, while mine was birth and moonblood.”

&gt;“But you were queen of all the Seven Kingdoms

&gt;“When it comes to swords

Queen is the very highest social rank a woman in Westerosi society can attain

Though it's limited her life in certain ways, tortured, or killed. She can fight if she wants to:

&gt;“Fighting is better than this waiting

Though she pitied Brienne for being so ugly, Catelyn thought with a pang of envy. She was like a man in that. For men the answer was always the same, and never farther away than the nearest sword. For a woman, a mother, the way was stonier and harder to know"" (ACOK 45/Catelyn VI)

In this society, and Ned Stark to return from war. Cersei was furious about being cooped up in Maegor's Holdfast with the ""hens"" while the Battle of Blackwater raged. It probably seemed ludicrous to her that she had to defer to her hated dwarf brother and pubescent son when it came to the defense of the city. In this society, women have to rely on men if they want to accomplish anything. 

In a martial society

&gt;""True knights protect the weak.”

&gt;[Sandor] snorted. “There are no true knights, don’t ever believe any different.”

&gt;...“You’re awful.”

&gt;“I’m honest. It’s the world that’s awful (ACOK 52/Sansa IV).

[Knights are not the exemplars of chivalry that the songs and men like Barristan Selmy believe.](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1dxv4m/spoilers_all_brienne_and_jaime_an_indepth/) There are very few knights (or men) like Barristan the Bold. For the most part, not romantic: 

&gt;She’d thought she was going to die then, and the man had shrieked loud as a horse. When his hand fell away, another hand, stronger, shoved her back into her saddle. The man with the garlicky breath was on the ground, blood pumping out the stump of his arm, but there were others all around, his sword a blur of steel that trailed a red mist as it swung. When they broke and ran before him he had laughed

Unlike Brienne and Sansa

&gt;“True knights would never harm women and children.” The words rang hollow in [Sansa's] ears even as she said them.

&gt;“True knights.” [Cersei] seemed to find that wonderfully amusing. “No doubt you’re right. So why don’t you just eat your broth like a good girl and wait for Symeon Star-Eyes and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight to come rescue you

Like Sandor and his twin

&gt;The crows had scarcely started on their corpses. The thin ropes cut deeply into the soft flesh of their throats

&gt;“True knights see worse every time they ride to war, yes.” (ASOS 1/Jaime I)

1370875394.0,1g1oqe,(Spoilers All) Why we shouldn't be too worried about Stannis in the show,aphidman,358,65,116,"I'm not an avid Stannis fan but I certainly find him to be one of the most interesting and enjoyable characters in the series. After rereading ASOS recently there were a few scenes

Now

“Lord Seaworth is a man of humble birth, Davos said. I was trying to win the throne to save the kingdom, when I should have been trying to save the kingdom to win the throne.”

Now

Now

Now

""I was trying to win the throne to save the kingdom

This is a great piece of dialogue and I hope D&amp;D use it but there's nothing to suggest that Stannis is not going to change as a character. He's not going to redeem himself and come to this realisation. I believe this will be an example of delayed characterisation. Just like Arya's murderous tendencies. It's not hard to imagine that, in the show he's a lot less hesitant to kill Gendry after Robb's death than Edric in the books. But the result is essentially the same.

If you completely disagree and think Stannis would not have bothered with Melisandre's counsel at that point in time - judging by his exchange with Jon Snow - then I still don't think there's been a character assassination. Most characters in the show have been altered somewhat in the adaptation - for good or for bad - and Stannis is no different. But really

Stannis comes to Jon and tells him how he was wrong during the War of the Five King's. That's what's important. That he comes to realise his greater purpose. That Davos was right. That he was misguided. This small exchange with Melisandre and Davos is not what's important. What's important is that Stannis changes as a character. He leaves the war as the bitter king fighting for his lawful duty to be King to the King Who Cared. That's what's important for Stannis's character and I think people should really hold off before throwing around ""character assassination"". Stannis needs a character arc and it makes no sense

Let's see where the show takes him and hopefully by the end of next season we get to see the Stannis that fan's love (or hate).

On a side note

Also

Just like we'll get a more jovial Tormund!!

His whole life is driven by love (obsession, and it drives his actions for the rest of his life.  He loved a girl who was too high-born for him, and she denied him (*had to deny him*, in his eyes) for that reason.  To Petyr Baelish, the very system of Lords and Ladies, crowns and kings, knights and serfs - the Game of Thrones itself is responsible for this tragedy.  To him, but the very world they live in will not allow them to be together.

So what is his goal?  To tear that world apart.  To create chaos.  He will never, the game fucked him.  So now he means to destroy the game.

And what better way to accomplish that goal than from the inside?  What will he do, sneaking into the heart of darkness, disguised as ""one of them"", only to tear the very foundations of that world apart.  It is a brilliant strategy, an ingenous means for accomplishing what is to him a morally justified end - vengeance.

He walks around with a mocking-bird pinned to his chest.  Every time he interacts with a high-born lord or lady at court, a farce.""  He has nothing but contempt for the game, and therefore thinks next to nothing of the players.  He finds himself morally absolved from all the evil he creates - the game itself is evil, and you only have yourself to blame for playing it.

His whole world changes when he meets Sansa.  When he first meets her, he has a second, better chance to win the woman he loves.  He doesn't want Sansa.  He wants Catelyn - 13 year old Catelyn Tully.  That is what Sansa represents.  A chance for vindication.

So now his goal has moved, and through that chaos, he achieves two goals.  First, he takes Sansa.  Second, he continues to undermine the game.

Good, who can say.  Obviously, he has selfish intentions when it comes to Sansa.  Daenerys, in one of her earlier *Game of Thrones* chapters, mentions how in all of the books and tales she read, you can tell that a man is evil because his eyes are always shifting, strange.  When Sansa meets Petyr, but again, I simply cannot hate this man.  Based on his experience, you are to blame for participating in a fundamentally flawed exercise in governance.

The first clue is the second Sam chapter from ASoS. After Lord Commander Mormont bites it and gets his face happily pecked by a crow, until he is warned by an old wife of Craster that *they* are coming. When Sam asks who they are she replies:
&gt;""The boy's brothers""
ASoS (p. 460).

To me that is a huge hint. Whenever I try to explain this theory to my friends and they aren't buying it, maybe some died in childbirth. But we definitely know, from this quote, that some have been taken away by the Others. Why else would that old woman make that connection? She must have known of dozens of Craster's sons who have been taken by the Others, she's so confident that *that is what they are*, there's no hesitation. 

The second clue is from the TV show, and they wanted us to see that. The Other doesn't grab the baby by his head, or by his leg. He's not slung over it's shoulder in haste and hostility; he is very gently, very *caringly* picked up and held in the (m)Others arms (sorry I had to). 

So, Craster had been living in that location for a long time and, I'm not sure where it is (maybe someone could help me), but I'm sure a character (possibly in the show or book) questions how Craster could have survived that long. Easily, make a deal with the Others, 'I'll give you some boys to bolster your numbers, and you can make sure me and my wives don't die'. 
I believe that little baby is currently front row in a workshop titled 'How to be an Other 101'

For a long time I've struggled with depression in my life. A lot of events in my personal life, I was really down. 

And then I read that line.

It really struck me. It made me take hold of myself and made me think about what happiness was. Its not something that happens TO you. It's sourced within. It comes FROM yourself. 

Now, ""is it in you to be happy?"" Like a mantra, it focuses me to rethink my place in the world and the way my mind works.



TL;DR

My question to y'all is this:

Maybe it's just me but I find but the actions of the crannogmen during the War of Five Kings, meaning they'd be of little help in the fields of the Riverlands/Westerlands/non-Neck North, but they sent their lord's two heirs to swear banners to The King In The North, and when Robb passes down orders, well, fuck if the crannogmen don't stick to them.

The collected leadership of the north was slaughtered at the Red Wedding, and the traitorous Boltons are consolidating power, bringing the other northern houses to heel. Cowering before the the Iron Throne, most of the north falls in line. 

But not the crannogmen. Their king told them to hold The Neck, they make life a swampy hell for them. When Roose Bolton's army passes through Moat Cailin, he uses a decoy and hides in a covered wagon, for fear of being surprised by a poisoned dart to the dome. They fought on after everyone else, and when they let the turncoat Boltons and Freys pass, it was out of tactical shrewdness.

Sure the crannogmen couldn't throw back the Bolton forces, though they may dwell in their bogs amongst the flies and snakes and lizard lions, they're still Northmen after all, and the north remembers.",,False,self,1360205853.0,t3_180wis

I'm thinking that it did and in big ways. I think it's possible that Howland Reed had the most influential and important green dream in the history of Westeros and set the Song of Ice and Fire in motion. Howland saw the long winter that is coming and he also saw the only way to save the world from the Others. He needed to attend that Tournament at Harrenhall so Lyanna could save him from the squires and enter the tournament as the Knight of the Laughing Tree. Who knows if this is what caught Rhaegar's attention but the next day after the mystery knight is gone and Rhaegar, he crowns Lyanna the Queen of Love and Beauty, thus setting the Song of Ice and Fire in motion. None of this would have happened had Howland Reed not showed up to this specific tournament and been bullied by those specific squires.

So I'm proposing that Howland Reed saw the fate of Westeros without Rhaegar and Lyanna's child, that he attended this one tournament to ensure that the war would not be lost by helping to deliver the prince that was promised.

DESTRIERS

* Large, strong, and intelligent. An example of a horse that would fit the destrier category would be a [Friesian.](http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/145/7/7/Friesian_stallion_beache2_by_lifaya.jpg)

PALFREYS

* Long limbed, and a well bred palfrey was highly prized. An example of a palfrey would be either the [Paso Fino](http://horsebreedsinfo.com/images/Paso_Fino.jpg) or the [American Saddlebred](http://modernsporthorses.com/img/jasluca.jpg?60).

COURSERS

* Light, as destriers are crazy expensive. Courser is really a very general term, and can be applied to any well bred horse fast and strong enough for battle. An example of a courser would be an [American Quarter Horse](http://www.best-horse-photos.com/images/Wild_Quarter_Horse.jpg) (I say quarter horse because they're used for herding cattle and are quick, agile and strong, good battle qualities).

ROUNSEY

* Basic riding horse, but not specially trained or highly bred. An example of a rounsey would be an [Australian Stock Horse](http://southernson.com/photos/nsw/border_ranges_national_park/australian_stock_horse_1bb.jpg).

GARRON

* Small, and have no problems with snow. An example of a garron would be a [Highland Pony](http://www.somis.dundee.ac.uk/~amdouglas/winter.gif) (these guys have their winter coats, which is why they're so shaggy).

ZORSE

* It's a zebra. [Duh.](http://images.nationalgeographic.com/wpf/media-live/photos/000/007/cache/zebra_764_600x450.jpg)


SAND STEED

* Fast, and can run for a day and a night without stopping. They require little water, and tolerate extreme heat well. An example of a sand steed would the [Arabian](http://us.123rf.com/400wm/400/400/vikarus/vikarus1005/vikarus100500008/6938324-white-arabian-horse-running-gallop-on-the-meadow.jpg) or the [Akhal Teke](http://horsebreedslist.com/horse_breed_images/60/big/akhal-teke-picture-2.jpg).

Ser Waymar's fighting one of them

So they speak a language and openly mock Ser Waymar. Then later:

&gt;The Other's parry was almost lazy.

So they understand their own strength

&gt;Far beneath him

Again

So they're calculated enough to have a language, and to purposely be lazy in a fight just because they can. They also don't mind standing back and watching a one-on-one fight, again, just because they can.

At the very least, they might not even be purely evil. As to their endgame, who knows, but here's another interesting quote from GRRM:

&gt;""The Others are not dead. They are strange, something like that… a different sort of life… inhuman, elegant, dangerous.""

##UPCOMING DEBATE

We will have a debate every two weeks (for now). As you can see our first proposition -- *Varys vs Littlefinger: Varys is more effective and better positioned to win in the end than Littlefinger. Agree or disagree?* -- is set for next Sunday (5/12). We will be voting on the two debate champions and moderator for the debate in a thread this **Sunday (5/5) @ 10PM GMT (6PM EST)**.

The earlier your nomination is in the selection thread the better your chance to win the vote. If you cannot be logged on when the selection thread goes live you can have someone else nominate you by proxy, or champion against; **you can only pick one**. You can accompany your nomination with a short ""sales pitch"" explaining why you should be selected (200 word maximum). Please refrain from being too in-depth about the actual debate topic in your sales pitch, since we hope to save as much of that for the actual debate. You can nominate someone other than yourself as well, but obviously he/she will have to accept the nomination if selected.

1366813781.0,1d0eeb,(spoilers all) Really sick of hearing a certain theory regarding the parentage of Tyrion and an alternate theory,johnnywup,391,118,245,"I really don't understand why so many people think Tyrion is a Targaryen. Is it just because he's a fan favorite and people want him to have a dragon? It seems much more likely that Jaime and Cersei are Targaryens

cersei was definitely born first and a lot of people think jaime may be the volanqar (I won't dispute this-- I'm just providing an additional interpretation).

It is known that Aerys took a... liking to Joanna

For one thing, Joffrey and Cersei seem to be pretty crazy, while Tommen, Myrcella and Jaime don't seem crazy. That's 2/5 crazy, pretty close to 50%. 

There's also the incest

In Jaime's dream about his mother
&gt;We all dream of things we cannot have. Tywin dreamed that his son would be a great knight
Jaime responds 
&gt;I am a knight and cersei is a queen.
Now obviously that's true so what did Joanna mean? Tywin wishes that they were his children.

Genna Lannister says to Jaime
&gt;Tyrion is Tywin's son

Tyrion is the only one between himself, a Lannister trait. Being beautiful is a Targaryen trait, not a Lannister trait. And the only one that shared Tywins love for whores was Tyrion.

That's why tywin is so bitter all the time. He knows that the two children he loves as his own aren't actually his and the one that is his he wishes was not.

Cersei also has a fixation on wildfire and takes her family icon very seriously like the Targaryens. Aerion attacked a puppeteer ""making fun"" of targs

Also explains why Aerys kept Jaime so close...he was his son. This also draws a nice parallel between Jaime and Tyrion

If you're wondering about the tywin whores thing

Aerys: Mad
Rhaella: Normal

3 children

Rhaegar: Normal

Dany: Normal/Mad (depending on how you look at her)

##MODERATOR [GALANIX'S](/u/galanix) OPENING WORDS

Varys and Petyr ""Littlefinger"" Baelish are both introduced to us as very enigmatic characters with hidden agendas. Both are major players in the game of thrones

I won't go over their entire histories and what events they have been involved in

So who is the more effective of the two and who is better positioned to win? This largely depends on how you determine ""winning"". For the purposes of this debate let's assume this means winning the game of thrones. Both are trying to amass power in Westeros through different routes with both of them presumably wanting control over the Iron Throne. It will be the job of our champions to determine whose route to power is more effective

In terms of positioning, and plans to marry Sansa to Harry the Heir and consolidate power thusly. Varys meanwhile has been lying in wait for a while with plans of seating a Targaryen on the Iron Throne along with his powerful ally [Illyrio Mopatis](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Illyrio). He currently is backing Aegon and the Golden Company who have most recently landed in the Stormlands and are poised to make that their base of power. There is also a Dornish alliance in the works, possible Reach allies, and Dany and her dragons. Most recently of course Varys has assassinated Kevan Lannister, Lord Regent of the realm.

Varys or Littlefinger? Who is the better of the two? Our champions will certainly have something to say about it.

*There are flaws for sure and I hope you point them out to deepen my understanding of the ASoIaF universe.*

**Love affair**

Ned has an affair with Ashara Dayne, so Catelyn is passed on to Eddard. He stops the affair, but Ashara already is pregnant a second time. She travels home to Starfall. The rumors about her being mother of Eddard's bastard are true, but it's not Jon Snow.

**""Promise me

Rhaegar's wife Elia Martell is weak and bedridden, ""abducts"" her and hides her in the Tower of Joy. She gets pregnant with Jon. Lyanna's cause of death remains unknown, but probably it's been done under Aerys II command shortly before his death by Jaimie's hand. Eddard rides with his companions to free his sister, finding her in a bed of blood. He promises her to take Jon with him as his own bastard son.

**Farewell**

After the fighting Eddard rides south, Ashara. To apologize for the death of Arthur Dayne, her brother, sworn member of the Kingsguard and still loyal to the Mad King. And to take a look on his true bastard son, who is wetnursed by Wylla. That's a common practice at house Dayne, as Edric will be wetnursed, too. But there's one major problem; Eddard can't suddenly have two bastards of the same age out of nowhere

**Spiderman**

Now some important Varys background. A famous quote is his riddle about power: 
&gt;In a room sit three great men, and a rich man with his gold. Between them stands a sellsword, a little man of common birth and no great mind. Each of the great ones bids him slay the other two. ‘Do it’ says the king, ‘for I am your lawful ruler.’ ‘Do it’ says the priest, ‘for I command you in the names of the gods.’ ‘Do it’ says the rich man, ‘and all this gold shall be yours.’ So tell me-who lives and who dies?

In my opinion the eunuch is a man of gold himself, nothing else. He does not care who sits the iron throne, by helping Viserys and Daenerys he hopes to become Master of Coin. But he's not stupid and relies on their success alone. He looks out for every chance to put himself in power. He is quoted: 
&gt;The world is one great web

He dares to touch all the strands. Also Varys once said: ""Power resides where men believe it resides. No more and no less"". They just don't care who rules over Westeros as long as they get money out of it. Varys was put in place by Illyrio

**Violet Eyes**

Ashara Dayne has dark hair and violet eyes, who is paid by Illyrio. They fake her suicide. Why do they help her? They already rescued Daenerys and Viserys, but were not able to protect Rhaegar's kids. Their plan is to disguise him as Aegon, to raise him up and educate him. He shall be a king one day. Varys kept in touch with exiled Jon Connington, he knows about JonCons remorse about failing  Rhaegar: 
&gt;I failed the father

He believes the tale of switching the babe with the [pisswater prince](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Pisswater_prince). Many young children have the tendency to be blond, so there has to be something special about hers. Jon Connington of course recognizes her (He danced with her at the turney of Harrenhal), but does not become suspicious, as she's sister to Arthur Dayne, best friend of Rhaegar. Even Aegon himself does not know about his real parents.

After that, he could dispose of Tyrion entirely and the entire issue of his succession and legacy would not only be resolved, but also be bolstered by the addition of the North.

It's true he never remarried after Joanna's death, given the political implications of it, but the same could be said about Tyrion and wasn't. Tyrion was heir-apparent to the Westerlands, and his children would be lords of the North and Westerlands. It's not as though Tywin had officially (or rather, publicly) disinherited Tyrion after all. Most importantly, he was the most powerful man in the realm at the time of Tyrion's marriage. No one would dare object to this decision to marry Sansa.

The first is in ASOS

&gt; “The corsair wanted only a hundred, girl.”

Secondly ADWD Dany III:

&gt;“Not all your enemies are in the Yellow City. Beware men with cold hearts and blue lips. You had not been gone from Qarth a fortnight when Pyat Pree set out with three of his fellow warlocks

&gt;Dany was more amused than afraid. “It is good I turned aside

&gt;“This is so

Martin

Are these the 4 Warlocks that Euron captures and locks up?

&gt;“Shade-of-the-evening, forty bolts of green silk, and four warlocks who told a curious tale. One presumed to threaten me, so I killed him and fed him to the other three.

I've seen some [valiant attempts](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/66847-patchface-prophesies/) to figure out whose starfish sigil can possibly connect to this prophecy

Readers try to connect ""the serving men are crabs"" to someones sigil as well (Such as [House Borrel](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Borrell))

1. The former Stark men serving Bolton in ADWD can rightly be described as scavengers picking up whatever scraps they can get. In this case the crabs will switch their allegiances to Manderly just as soon as the soup is ready. 

2. If we want to connect it to a sigil, and mayhaps the Skagosi will be willing to march off to support the new Wild Wolf reclaim his birthright.

1342652717.0,wsbsm,(Spoilers all) Character analysis: In defense of Catelyn Tully,soigneusement,375,113,394,"(I apologize in advance for the length

In defense of Catelyn Tully:

For some reason a very large part of this fandom enjoys to heap an exorbitant amount of blame for half the things that go wrong in this series on Catelyn. She is crucified for her mistakes (and the mistakes of others!) while other characters in this series are given a free pass (Ned Stark

**Cat hates Jon Snow

I dont't think people that come to this conclusion really take the time to think about the situation Cat is in from her perspective. She was betrothed to Brandon Stark, they marry, she gets pregnant with their first son, and Ned goes off to war. This man, her husband, returns from the war with a bastard son. Not only is this a huge affront to Catelyn and absolutely disrespectful to her in every way (the man she married as a replacement for Brandon not only slept with another woman, but he has the gall to *bring the evidence home with him*), *extremely* unusual in Westerosi society. Men don't bring home the products of their conquests at war. They just don't. It is an unspoken rule

So now imagine you're Cat. You're already extremely hurt that your supposedly incredibly honorable husband who you weren't even supposed to marry in the first place cheated on you with some nameless whore (he won't even tell you her name, who the mother of this child is?) but now you have to see the product of his shame (*your* shame) every single day until this child leaves. Every day you are reminded of your husband's infidelity, the shame and embarrassment and disrespect he's brought upon you is embodied in this child. He even plays with your trueborn children as if they were equals (they aren't, he is a bastard, and Robb is to be the lord of Winterfell, they aren't equals and bastards aren't normally raised in castles).

Catelyn has no obligation to play step-mother to Jon. Ned made the bad decision to bring this child home, with an understandable undercurrent of anger coupled with non-interaction. Catelyn does not abuse Jon, she does not beat him or berate him or toss him out to live in Winter Town. She is cold toward him, yes, but not cruel. And after all is said and done, when Jon goes to the Wall, Cat even feels *guilty* about the way she treated him.

&gt;Catelyn had nothing against this girl, both at once.

Her relationship with Jon is complex and she wasn't a kind cookie baking step-mother to him

**It's Catelyn's fault that the War of the Five Kings was started in the first place

Again, barely sleeping, barely eating, your thoughts only of your son and his recovery. One night an assassin comes, and if it hadn't been for your son's direwolf you would both be dead (you have the scars on your hands for your trouble). This assassin is obviously a catspaw, that much is sure, and in his possession is a Valyrian steel dagger. Obviously

So Cat goes off to King's Landing where she meets with Petyr Baelish

&gt;“He was my father‟s ward. We grew up together in Riverrun. I
thought of him as a brother...""

Why wouldn't Cat think she could trust Petyr? He's never led her astray before, in case you were wondering) made that cost him his life. Another mistake that is seen as a great catalyst in starting the War of the Five Kings. Oddly, Ned doesn't get blamed for putting his trust in Littlefinger, even though it results in his death, his 11 year old daughter becoming a political prisoner, and his son going off to war to avenge him. Moving on...

&gt;Ser Jaime lost a hundred golden dragons
pendant

&gt;“Who?” Catelyn demanded
pain.

&gt;“The Imp

Littlefinger explicitly tells Cat that Tyrion Lannister is responsible for the attempt on her son's life. If you were in her position, from the moment that Varys slips Petyr's dagger to Joffrey and whispers in his ear about gaining Robert's approval (this is speculation, but I think it has merit). 

So, the man she believes responsible for trying to kill Bran. You know how it ends, and I will concede that Cat didn't go about this in the best possible way. However, I believe that her mistake is totally justifiable and not something that should be touted as the reason for the war. Even if she hadn't taken Tyrion the war would have erupted, everything was on unstable ground just waiting to collapse. Cat nabbing Tyrion was just a convenient catalyst to finally set the ball rolling. The war would have happened regardless, and the amount of blame placed on Cat for it is absurd.

**Cat is an idiot and it's her fault Robb died and Jaime lost his hand

Okay. First let's establish Cat's mindset around the time of the war. She has just lost her husband, as well as counseling him as best she can in terms of decisions about the war. She tells Robb not to send Theon back to Pyke.

&gt;“I‟ll say again
Theon close to you.”

&gt;“Who better to treat with Balon Greyjoy than his son?”

&gt;“Jason Mallister

&gt;Her son squatted beside Grey Wind

It is also Cat's decision to call upon Renly Baratheon for help.

&gt;“We have some time yet before we must face them. This lot will be sellswords
green boys from the stews of Lannisport. Ser Stafford must see that they are armed and drilled before he dare risk battle . . . and make no mistake

&gt;“Unless . . .” said Catelyn.

&gt;“Yes?” Ser Brynden prompted.

&gt;“Unless he must leave Harrenhal

&gt;Her uncle looked at her thoughtfully. “Lord Renly.”

&gt;“King Renly.” If she would ask help from the man

Cat is a politically savvy creature where her son is young and reckless (understandably

""Home

The *Iron Victory* was lashed alongside the *Noble Lady*, watching as Victarion clapped Wulf One-Ear on the shoulder and sent him clambering up the ladder. The sea was smooth and still, the sky bright with stars. Wulf ordered the ladder drawn up, the chains cast off. The warship and the cog parted ways. In the distance the rest of Victarion's famed fleet was raising sail. A ragged cheer went up from the crew of the *Iron Victory*, and was answered in kind by the men of the *Noble Lady*.

Victarion had given Wulf his best fighters. He envied them. They would be the first to strike a blow, of his first woman. A restlessness was in him, a hunger for the dawn and the things this day would bring. *Death or glory, I will drink my fill of both today.* The Seastone Chair should've been his when Balon died, but his brother Euron had stolen it from him, just as he had stolen his wife many years before. *He stole her and he soiled her, but he left it for me to slay her.*

All that was done and gone now

""Captain."" The voice belonged to Longwater Pyke. ""The oarsmen await your pleasure.""

Three of them

The oarsmen were all big. One was a boy, the Brute for twenty. They had names, but Victarion did not know them. One had come from *Lamentation*, one from *Sparrow Hawk*, one from *Spider Kiss*. He could not be expected to know the names of every thrall who had ever pulled an oar in the Iron Fleet.

“Show them the horn

Moqorro brought it forth, towering – but even in his grasp the horn looked huge.

“My brother found this thing on Valyria

“They say he died

“Aye. The horn was smoking after. The mute had blisters on his lips

“The horn is cursed

“A dragon’s horn from Valyria, it is a precious thing, and powerful. With this I’ll win the Seastone Chair, and then the Iron Throne. With this I’ll win the world.*

“Claggorn blew the horn thrice and died for it. He was as big as any of you

“It will kill us too

Victarion did not oft forgive a thrall for talking out of turn, and soon to die besides. He let it pass.

“The mute sounded the horn three times. You three will sound it only once. Might be you’ll die, drowned, burned alive – only the Gods know which of us will still be here come the morrow. Sound the horn and live and I’ll make free men of you, one or two or all three. I’ll give you wives, a bit of land, a ship to sail, thralls of your own. Men will know your names.”

“Even you

“Aye.”

“I’ll do it then.”

“And me

The Brute crossed his arms and nodded.

If it made the three feel braver to believe they had a choice

“You will sail with me on *Iron Victory*, you’re the youngest – you’ll sound the horn first. When the time comes you will blow it long and loud. They say you are strong. Blow the horn until you are too weak to stand, until the last bit of breath has been squeezed from you, until your lungs are burning. Let the freedmen hear you in Meereen, the slavers in Yunkai, the ghosts in Astapor. Let the monkeys shit themselves at the sound when it rolls across the Isle of Cedars. Then pass the horn along to the next man. Do you hear me? Do you know what to do?”

The Boy and the Bastard’s Bastard tugged their forelocks; the Brute might’ve done the same

“You may touch the horn. Then go.”

They left him one by one. The three thralls

**Stannis Baratheon used ethically suspect tactics
_____________

The Strategic Picture at the Start of A Clash of Kings
-

Stannis Baratheon is introduced to the readers in the prologue of A Clash of Kings. I don't want to get too bogged down with the how Stannis came to view himself as the rightful king of Westeros. Suffice to say that when his older brother Robert died, he prepared to fight his way to the throne. For more on Westerosi succession, I highly recommend /u/galanix's [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/16mqp1/spoilers_all_complete_guide_to_westerosi/) on it. 

Unfortunately for Stannis, Renly Baratheon, the youngest Baratheon son, crowned himself King and secured Tyrell loyalty by marrying Margaery, the daughter of Lord Mace Tyrell. Robb Stark, son of Eddard, defeated the Lannisters in battle and declared himself King in the North and the Greyjoys were preparing to declare their own independence.

With Renly claiming the loyalty of most Stormland lords
 
&gt; It was said that Stannis knew the strength of every house in the Seven Kingdoms. - *A Clash of Kings

However small his army was

Besides military strength, the Lord of Light. He used Melisandre as a means of projecting this eastern ethereal power into Westeros. And while Melisandre and R'hillor are unpopular, their power will come to have great strategic and tactical significance at Storm's End.   
_____________ 

Force Multiplication and Unsavory Tactics
-

&gt; ""I was helping Renly into his armor, Chapter 62, Jaimie VII*

Recognizing that his was an untenable position

Here

&gt; Stannis Baratheon's foragers had cut the trees down for his siege towers and catapults. - *A Clash of Kings

But what was his plan when Renly arrived? Did he expect Renly to capitulate to his claim during their parlay? I guess we're led to believe that Stannis expects to win Renly over on the strength of his claim, it would be unlike Stannis not to have a plan. Renly had 20,000-odd soldiers to Stannis's maybe 5,000. Barring an act of *God*, Stannis would face destruction.

As Stannis and Renly rode back to their camps

The U.S. Army has a [3:1 rule](http://onviolence.com/?e=191) when attacking or defending. However that ratio can be altered by what are known as force multipliers defined as:

&gt; A capability that, pg 394](http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/dod/jp3_05_01.pdf)

Melisandre's Shadow Assassin was a force multiplier in that it increased the combat potential (defined very narrowly in this case) of Stannis's force. When Renly was killed by the shadow baby, to include Loras Tyrell and Randyll Tarly, fled back to Bitterbridge to join with the rest of Mace Tyrell's army.

With Renly dead

Cortnay Penrose refused to surrender, Stannis, all the newly-sworn lords of Stannis, Cortnay threw his glove at Stannis and challenged him to single combat.

&gt; ""Bring on your storm, the name of this castle."" - *A Clash of Kings, Chapter 42, Davos II*

It would have been foolishness for Stannis to accept or to allow any of his bannermen to fight in his stead. He was assured victory in taking the castle

Unwilling to lose thousands of his soldiers in taking Storm's End by force or to let one of his knights or lords face Ser Cortnay Penrose in single combat

&gt; ""Explain to me why it is more noble to kill ten thousand men in battle than a dozen at dinner."" - *A Storm of Swords

The result of utilizing a Shadow Assassin was much as it had been with Renly. A shadow warrior was birthed under the walls of Storm's End and pushed Ser Cortnay Penrose to his death
_____________

Moral Culpability?
-

A question that's asked frequently is how much Stannis knew about the Shadow Assassin. My answer is that on a conscious level

&gt; ""I dream of it sometimes. Of Renly's dying. A green tent, fretting. I should have been ahorse, armored. I knew Renly would attack at break of day. Devan says I thrashed and cried out, but what does it matter? It was a dream. I was in my tent when Renly died, and when I woke my hands were clean."" - *A Clash of Kings, Chapter 42, Davos II*

Stannis's moral culpability in utilizing this tactic lies in not asking questions, he feels guilty from it. He also did profit **greatly** from this tactic.

1375905082.0,1jwlm5,(Spoilers All) Another (Possibly New) Theory On the Fate of Jon Snow,Odd_or_Even,368,109,123,"So I know this might seem like a really anti climactic theory on what happened to Jon at the end of ADWD but **I think that there is a chance that Ghost is the one that was stabbed and possibly killed

We know that Jon is a warg and that he is not aware of how to use his power. The only time he has warged into ghost have been in dreams. So I think it is conceivable that he could have accidentally warged into Ghost and not have realized it. After his speech he goes outside and hears a scream and runs off to see where it came from and stumbles on to Wun Wun tearing apart one of the queens men. As Jon is running to where the scream is coming from GRRM is very non descriptive

When Jon is trying to calm down Wun Wun he shouts orders at people but nobody even acknowledges that he is saying anything. If Jon was Ghost at this point it would make sense that no one could hear what he is say because 1.) Ghost is silent and 2.) Ghost is a wolf. When Wick slashes at Jon's throat and is rejected Wick backs away with his hands up almost as if he is afraid of being attacked by a wild animal and not a surprised Jon. When Jon goes to reach for his sword he fumbles with it and can't even bring it out. To me this seems uncharacteristic of Jon, but it never says how he did it. He could have easily have done it as Ghost with his mouth. Also he is stabbed four times, which feels like overkill unless they were trying to bring down a large Direwolf. As for the cold that Jon feels after being stabbed it could just be the affect of the animal he is warging into being killed. We know from the prologue and ASOS that when the animal that a warg uses is killed it has an effect on the warg himself. When Varamyr sixskins is inside the eagle and Melisandre burns it Varamyr goes insane for a short period of time. Overall the whole attack on Jon was very vague which lends itself to so many possible theories.

Now you might be wondering why they would have wanted to kill Ghost. earlier in the same chapter it is noted that Ghost had been acting strange since Borroq came to castle black and even nipped at one of the members of the nights watch. I think that in his current state he could have done something that was seen as an attack and caused Wun Wun to freak out. It Also could be that that the members of the nights watch just wanted to send a message to Jon or they wanted to get rid of his Direwolf before they came after him. Also earlier in the chapter Melisandre tells Jon how he needs to be fearful and cautious

As for why GRRM would do this when he has shown no hesitation to kill or maim popular characters before I think you have to turn to Petyr Baelish who said ""I had no motive. Always keep your foes confused. Sometimes the best way to baffle them is to make moves that have no purpose…Remember that when you come to play the game of thrones."" With GRRM's style of killing popular characters very well known by now this is the only way that he can 1.) kill a popular character, 2.) keep Jon alive without using a previously used method of bringing the dead back to life, and 3.) keep the readers guessing.

**XII. Walking with Ghosts**

[The Hound](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1elahs/spoilers_all_brienne_and_jaime_an_indepth/) isn't the only figure haunting Brienne's chapters. Dead bodies appear at the start and end of her travels in ASOS and AFFC. At the beginning of their overland journey to King's Landing, and Cleos encountered the bodies of women hanged from a tree:

&gt;...Jaime made out the smoldering remains of a large building

&gt;The crows had scarcely started on their corpses. The thin ropes cut deeply into the soft flesh of their throats

Brienne felt sorry enough for the women that she cut them down and tried to bury them. Hanged bodies also mark the end of her travels in AFFC. Prior to arriving at the inn of the orphans:

&gt;They came upon the first corpse a mile from the crossroads.

&gt;He swung beneath the limb of a dead tree whose blackened trunk still bore the scars of the lightning that had killed it. The carrion crows had been at work on his face

&gt;...

&gt;Fifty yards farther on they spied the second body

&gt;...

&gt;After that, larch and elm, hoary old willows and stately chestnut trees. Each man wore a noose around his neck, and swung from a length of hempen rope, and each man’s mouth was packed with salt...

&gt;Some of the dead men had been bald and some bearded, some tall, some fat, some thin. Swollen in death, with faces gnawed and rotten, they all looked the same. On the gallows tree, all men are brothers. Brienne had read that in a book

Despite herself, yet the sight still made her sad."" 

Brienne's pity even for these apparently evil men is perhaps justified. These men and women did not have much choice in their fates--the women ""earned their traitors’ collars, the names of these hanged women and men won't be recorded in any histories, their deeds won't be recounted in songs. 

It's significant that these hanged common people mark the start and end of Brienne's journeys in ASOS and AFFC. First, when the great lords play their game of thrones"" (AFFC 37/Brienne VII). But even the nobly born are not necessarily masters of their destinies. Like the hanged people, Brienne was given an impossible choice, doomed no matter what she did.

As I've discussed in previous posts, in many ways, predetermined by the departed. Robb Stark carried out a war to avenge his dead father. Ned Stark did the same for his dead father and brother. After learning about [Tywin's role in Robb's downfall](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1c9c19/spoilers_all_lord_tywins_plan/), Jaime reflects, ""Even from the grave, Lord Tywin’s dead hand moves us all"" (AFFC 44/Jaime VII). Brienne herself was on a quest to fulfill a promise to a dead woman. It's no wonder, perhaps

The dead haunt the memory of the living. One ghost who appears several times in Brienne's chapters is Ser Goodwin

&gt;Old Ser Goodwin was long in his grave, and their pride will make them want to vanquish you quickly, lest it be said that a woman tried them sorely. Let them spend their strength in furious attacks, whilst you conserve your own. Wait and watch, girl, wait and watch. (AFFC 37/Brienne VII)

.

&gt;His strength, all his hard-won skill... it was worth less than a mummer’s fart, because he flinched from killing. Remember that, girl.”

&gt;I will, and I pray I will not flinch (AFFC 20/Brienne IV).

But for the most part

&gt;That was where the archers hid and slew poor Cleos Frey...but half a mile farther on she passed another wall that looked much like the first and found herself uncertain....Had she ridden past the place where Ser Jaime had snatched his cousin’s sword from its scabbard? Where were the woods they’d fought in? The stream where they’d splashed and slashed at one another until they drew the Brave Companions down upon them?

&gt;“My lady? Ser?...What are you looking for?”

&gt;Ghosts.... (AFFC 14/Brienne III)

And later: 

&gt;Ser Myles was bold as brass till that Robert killed him.”

&gt;More ghosts

Although she is a warrior maid, more than once, “but your heart is as soft as any maid’s"" (AFFC 20/Brienne IV). Ser Goodwin used to make her slaughter lambs and piglets to toughen her up, but Brienne still hasn't become desensitized to killing. Her guilt over it infects her dreams:

&gt;...[S]he dreamed about the men she’d killed. They danced around her, yet still they swarmed around her... Shagwell, Timeon, and Pyg, aye, but Randyll Tarly too, and Vargo Hoat, she cut his hand off. (AFFC 25/Brienne V)

She doesn't even feel good about killing scumbags like Shagwell

&gt;Hunt would not listen. He hacked through the dead men’s necks himself, but sometimes, especially at night, she could feel their dead eyes on her back, and once she dreamed she heard them whispering to one another. (AFFC 25/Brienne V)

Even though she is a warrior, the dead are everywhere in Brienne's chapters, watching her, judging her. Why?

-------------------------------
**XIII. What Is Dead May Never Die**

The many instances of Brienne seeing or thinking about ghosts and dead people in her chapters are laying the groundwork for a pivotal moment in her penultimate POV chapter.

Besides [the Hound](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1elahs/spoilers_all_brienne_and_jaime_an_indepth/)

&gt;[Tyrion] “Is it true that Stannis was put to rout by Renly’s ghost?”

&gt;Bronn smiled thinly. “From the winch towers, and they went right back over at the sight of him in that shiny green armor.”

&gt;After all his planning, Tyrion had been eclipsed by a dead man. If indeed Renly is dead. (ASOS 4/Tyrion I)

The losers of the Battle of Blackwater have also spread the tale of Renly's avenging ghost:

&gt;Captain Khorane had told [Davos] of the end of Stannis’s hopes...The Lannisters had taken him from the flank

&gt;Renly’s shade. Davos wondered if his sons would return as shades as well. He had seen too many queer things on the sea to say that ghosts did not exist.... (ASOS 10/Davos II)

There's even a song at Joffrey's wedding feast about Renly's ghost:

&gt;...Hamish the Harper announced that he would perform “for the ears of gods and men

&gt;His fingers moved across the strings of the high harp...“From his throne of bones the Lord of Death looked down on the murdered lord, repenting his attempt to usurp his nephew’s crown, had defied the Lord of Death himself and crossed back to the land of the living to defend the realm against his brother. (ASOS 60/Tyrion VIII)

My thoughts are that Talisa's mother will replace the role of the Widow of the Waterfront who Tyrion meets while in Volantis. It makes sense that she would seek vengeance against the Iron Throne.

1. Ashara Dayne. She is an obvious candidate. It seems from the Laughing Knight story that Ned might have had a crush on her. We also know that a Stark ""dishonored"" her at the tourney. Even if it was Brandon, she is still an attractive daughter of a powerful Southern lord. Additionally, it's not like she is the only candidate potentially dishonored by Brandon.

2. Cersei. She is a candidate that would fit the bill if you believe Lady Dustin about Rickard's Southron Ambition. Ned, but at the time there was a general lack of available great lords/heirs for Cersei to wed, Jon Arryn being the only one I can think of.

However, and mainly because this just makes sense. I'm sure this version of events has been put forward before, but here goes.

Barristan mentions in ADWD that Ashara birthed a still born child, fits perfectly. He had the Wolf's Blood and it wouldn't be the first noble lady he 'dishonored' (see: Lady Dustin). This may also be how Howland got to be in the Starks' tent, since Brandon was with Ashara.

So

Unfortunately, Rhaegar and Lyanna are at the Tower of Joy in Dorne, so only cruel, paranoid Aerys is there. Her lover *strangles himself watching his father burn to death* thanks to the king. That's awful enough, but remember, Ashara's beloved brother and his friends guard this royal family with their lives, and did nothing. 

Thanks to all the above, her lover's sister. She feels terrible about that, Lyanna's 'kidnapping' is the indirect cause of Brandon's death and the reason for the war. She thinks that her brother is allowing her to remain captive while Rhaegar is raping her. 

Anyway, her lover's honorable brother is searching for their younger sister. Considering Arthur is at the ToJ, and that Wylla likely was there as well to nurse Lyanna, Ashara knows her location.

Ashara decides to help him, they find the Kingsguard. We all know what happens next. Ned is forced to cut down Arthur to get to his sister, only to find out that Lyanna went willingly with Rhaegar and had a child (Jon) with him.

So he returns to Ashara with Arthur's sword and tells her that Arthur was in fact good and honorable to the end, she commits suicide and throws herself off a tower.

Cogman describes the rationale for various show changes

But the writing geek in me found this part most interesting -- he described

&gt; Anyway

&gt; 1. I reread A Storm of Swords (and any relevant chapters from other books in the series) and wrote up brief summaries of each chapter, and mapped out the story arcs. (This was during production of Season Two, in Belfast).

&gt; 2. The major characters were then divided up between David, and myself — with each of us doing a first pass at mapping out the Season Three storyline for each. In my case, I was assigned Stannis/Mel/Davos, Arya, and Bran. This work was done as we were finishing up Season 2 production and over the holiday break.

&gt; 3. In January, threw all our first drafts up on the board and hashed out the season, combining stuff, throwing stuff out, coming up with new stuff, going back to the books for stuff we might have missed, etc… this took a couple of weeks. By the end

&gt; 4. Each of us was then assigned a cluster of episodes to outline… I can’t remember which ones I worked on… Once those were turned in

&gt; 5. I was assigned episode five. I had about a month to write the first draft, change the order, etc… Then I get my notes, do revisions, etc… we tweak the scripts as we go and, in some cases, come up with new scenes during production. Sometimes those later scenes are written by D&amp;D — for example, storylines shift — usually this is with Dany. All the Essos scenes in 305 were originally scripted by D&amp;D for 306 but moved into my script early in pre-production. Happy to have them,False,

I believe that Jon Snow comes back as an other.  Not just some run of the mill other, or they wouldn’t have been included in the prologue of GOT, or their return be a once in 8000 year event.

As for textual clues

It is interested that Jon springing leaks from multiple stab wounds did not feel any warmth

Secondly, I know, I know, oh, oh, oh.”   – ADWD 706 of 1016 Kindle Edition.  This fits in two ways.  One, the allusion that in death, that “under the sea” means “in death” which makes a pretty good amount of sense.  What I propose is that he is being more specific, who is there when Patchface is speaking.

We know that Mel doesn’t like Patchface, or some other force of evil, this would make sense.  Patchface gets real excited when Jon walks in referring to him as “The Crow, the crow”, rather just any old crow.  He definitely knows who Jon is.

Mel also keeps seeing snow in the flames.  We know that she is terrified of the other, white snow, because he has become what she cannot see, the embodiment of the other against which she must fight.

Last, but of royal blood.  His name Snow, would be another prophecy, disguised by the naming pattern of bastards in Westeros.

Anyway, some may not.  I have only read over the books once so I apologize if this is truly half baked!

1349203065.0,10tv6i,(Spoilers ALL) Benjen Stark's Secret Identity Theory,JayisforJokes,326,83,223,"Alright everybody


Benjen Stark's whereabouts always has intrigued me in large part because he went missing early on in the first novel and has yet to resurface.


The first option for Benjen that most people (myself included) go to is that he is Coldhands. Easy enough right? The child of the forest disproves this in my eyes by implying that Coldhands has been around for a lot longer than Benjen has been missing for. We all know that GRRM likes to disguise his characters as other characters and no character is ever dead without a firsthand account. By this logic I will make the argument that no


Well that raises a lot more questions since there are so many characters. Ones that can be ruled out immediately are people that would recognize Benjen. Therefore

 
Before moving on with this I will also state that I believe Jon Snow is the son of Lyanna and Rhaegar. Also, Ned would. Why would Ned? To me it seems like why wouldn't Ned? Benjen is family and would deserve to know the truth about his sister and since he is safe on the wall, Ned wouldn't be paranoid that Benjen could let it slip after a few too many brews at the family reunion.

 
Okay so to summarize where our thought process is right now:


Benjen is alive and disguised as another character


Benjen is aware of Lyanna's relationship with Rhaegar and her Targaryen sympathy (she chose Rhaegar over her own brother and father even if unintentionally)


Alright so back to who could Benjen be in disguise? As already demonstrated by Barristan


The next question that this brings up is why would Benjen go to Dany? Here there is definitely room for interpretation so this next part is completely what I feel makes sense.


Benjen is the First Ranger of the Nights Watch. He understands the true magnitude of the danger (the Others) that the Seven Kingdoms is about to be faced with. If Benjen was to learn about Dany and her dragons he could reason that they would be a huge help in the coming war against Ice. How did Benjen learn of Dany and her dragons though? Ships from Essos occasionally make their way North so that's possible. Information tends to move through Varys so maybe he even suggested it to Benjen as a part of his grand scheme. Or maybe Benjen saw her in the fire similar to the way others have (I know Benjen hasn't had any Fire Priest tendencies before but this could be an exception). If Benjen knew of Lyanna’s love for Rhaegar and that they had a child together he would be much more receptive to helping Dany.


Okay, Varys or prophecy I don't know). Another side point to make is that Dany is unwillingly collecting a legendary assortment of individuals about her in preparation for her destiny. A Stark would definitely be an asset to her.


Who then could Benjen be if indeed he went to Dany? This is where the theory materializes.


I think that Benjen Stark is undercover as Daario Naharis. I can hear some of your screams of denial already. Why Daario you ask? That seems completely random and improbable!!! Yes


First let's start with their appearances. Both seem to be of similar age and average build (warrior types smaller than the Hound/Mountain). Not saying much I know but at least they aren’t worlds apart. I believe both have blue eyes but once again I don’t have the book with me to quote anything. Both have beards and long hair (hardly a tell tale sign but still a match nonetheless). My next point convinces me the most however. Daario seems like he is in a disguise. Yes, distracting colors? One glance and you say ""Oh that's a Tyroshi sell sword"" and think nothing of it. If Benjen were to hide his appearance, a Tyroshi get up is the equivalent to a costume.


Alright so maybe these two guys look similar and maybe Benjen is posing as a Tyroshi sell sword as a disguise but how would it come about? The timeline seems to work for them both. Benjen disappeared early on and could have gone East and joined a mercenary band. He's a very capable fighter as are most Starks and particularly the First Ranger of the Night's Watch. Therefore it is believable that Benjen rose in the ranks of a mercenary group very quickly


I'm sure many of you are still feeling like Daario was just a random guess of who Benjen could be and you're right, let’s continue. A sell sword would want to see a return on his investment, in this case for supporting Dany. As Davos' pirate demonstrated, sell swords and pirates are typically not patient when it comes to compensation. Yet Daario is so patient and utterly loyal right from the beginning...... two characteristics that scream out to me as him being a fake sell sword!


If Daario is Benjen in disguise


The next question one might have would be why would Benjen just abandon his brothers on the Night's Watch like this? He swore an oath to serve the realm until his death! Starks do not take oaths lightly. Well technically he still is keeping his oath. In fact, that would be the first thing he would suggest to do.


Another point is that Benjen's disappearance with Jon's arrival seems coincidental but what if it was intentional? It is said that a Stark must always be on the wall. Perhaps Benjen, some say that Benjen came to Winterfell due to the rarity and grandeur of the King coming North but there could be more to that as well. What if Benjen, privy to the fact that Robert was coming to drag Ned South, knew a visit to Jon would convince him to join him on the wall. By playing a little devil's advocate and saying the wall will always be there for him, he gambled that Jon would be more excited rather than deterred. Benjen might not have known for sure if it would work but maybe once Jon joined the Night's Watch so quickly Benjen was able to proceed with his bigger plans and head East.


So to summarize a bit


1) It is likely Benjen is alive and another character (GRRM's style).


2) Dany is ignorant about the people in Westeros making Benjen joining her possible and also she is important making Benjen's purpose more plausible.


3) Daario hasn't behaved like a typical sell sword would and his dyed beard and piercings would make a perfect disguise for Benjen.


4) Benjen must have a bigger role to play in the grand scheme of things or he would have been found dead already. What bigger role could he have than helping Dany bring the dragons to the wall and save the Seven Kingdoms from the Others?


I think that covers all I wanted to say AND I effectively wasted an hour at work. Double success. Let me know what you guys think if any of you have the heart or stomach to get through this and try not to ruthlessly rip it apart since I haven’t even reread the books with this theory in mind. Sorry for the length of the post but I wanted to convey all of my thoughts since this theory is walking on thin ice (pun intended).

EDIT: Something to consider as well that I thought of after that some of you might find interesting would be that Benjen=Daario would have very strong parallels with Jon going undercover with the wildlings. Both had to abandon their brothers in a time of need for a greater cause

Now, Ramsay. Episode 3 took me by surprise because Ramsay rescues Theon again... despite my belief that he would simply hunt him down (just like in the books). 

After watching the episode 4 preview (link below), when Theon is freed from what is presumably the Dreadfort, Ramsay tells him to ride east. 

The only castle east of the Dreadfort... is Karhold. 

Now here's my suspicions: they've been playing up the Karstarks as a force that is slowly moving away from Robb. Could it be that the Bastard gets unveiled at the same time that they reveal an alliance between Bolton and Karstark against Robb? Is the bastard in league with the karstarks?

The rule is quite simple and was agreed upon by the community a long, *.jpg files, or any other files/links that provide copyright infringed media will result in warnings and/or bans. Trying to find clever ways to circumvent this rule will result in a ban with no warning.

This build up allows for the full force of Ned's death and the Red Wedding to really hit home.

Like many though, given that they are scattered all over the place.

I have therefore developed something of a theory based on the apparent parallel's between the storyline of the Starks

One could argue that Jon (who most likely is a Stark one way or another) and even Rickon could be included in this. However, and I am also wary of merely fitting evidence to suit my theory. So I have focussed on Arya, Bran and Sansa.

The theme is perhaps most strong in Arya's storyline but I think all three have significant parallels.

All 3 of these character's have ended up in positions where they are learning a set of skills that are very specific

Arya- how to be a Faceless Man

Bran- the art of Greenseeing

Sansa- how to play the Game of Thrones

It is also interesting how these skills match the personality traits and characters that we met from an early stage. Arya was always quick on her feet, stealthy, wished she was a fighter etc. Bran loved to climb Winterfell so he could look down on the whole castle and he revelled in knowing the secret passages. Sansa loved the Southern courtesies and knowing the right thing to say, as well as the heraldry.

They are also all being taught these skills by experts in their given fields:

Arya- The Kindly Man who is clearly one of the most learned in the arts of the Faceless Men

Bran- Bloodraven who

Sansa- Littlefinger who has been repeatedly presented as the master of politics and the ultimate Machiavellian character.

One could easily argue that they are being taught by the very best in their field.

So what do these parallels mean for their possible futures? Well I think we are already given hints about what lies ahead

The names recited are a clear indication she has 'unfinished business', furthemore Nymeria is still lost in Westeros and a reunion could still be on the cards. I therefore think that at some point its likely Arya will turn her back on the faceless men and return to Westeros with a whole heap of deadly talents.

There have also been hints as to Sansa's growing confidence and ability. Her story thus far has been pretty low key in that she hasn't achieved much. From the very beginning she frustrated us by being disloyal to Arya when talking about the fight with Joffrey

Bran has been lead north essentially on Jojen Reeds advice. He does not appear to have any long term plans, who appears to want him to become a greenseer sitting in a tree too (I just don't think this is Bran). 

Quite how this would work I am not sure, and return with a set of skills that can make the Stark's great again.

Maybe this is just wishful thinking though! What do you think?

**XI. Why Sleeping Dogs Won't Lie**


Something I noticed while rereading Brienne's chapters in ASOS, is that 'the Hound' keeps popping up, even though the last time we saw him, he was in very bad shape. Throughout AFFC, there are confused reports that the Hound has been terrorizing the Riverlands, particularly the town of Saltpans, in a way that's reminiscent of the Mountain's depravities in AGOT: 

AFFC

&gt;...The bird had come last night

Chapter 16/Jaime II:  

&gt;...Sandor Clegane is raiding along the Trident
&gt;Jaime had heard about Saltpans. By now half the realm had heard. The raid had been exceptionally savage. Women raped and mutilated

Chapter 25/Brienne V:

&gt;“We only seek one outlaw

&gt;“So Ser Hyle told me. May the Seven save you

Chapter 28/Cersei VI:

&gt;“Some of my sparrows speak of bands of lions who despoiled them... and of the Hound, who cut off her nose and nipples.”

Chapter 30/Jaime IV:

&gt;What they were describing sounded more like Gregor’s work than Sandor’s. Sandor had been hard and brutal

&gt;“He was seen, and there were a few who survived to tell the tale. The girl he raped, some boys who hid, a woman we found trapped beneath a blackened beam, the fisherfolk who watched the butchery from their boats...”

&gt;“Do not call it butchery

&gt;This is a time for beasts, for ravens and carrion crows.

...

During her encounter with Timeon, Brienne learned that the Hound had a Stark girl with him and had last been seen at the inn at the crossroads. Brienne thought the girl was Sansa, but it was actually Arya. Unbeknownst to Brienne, this information is old. Readers know Arya has long since escaped Sandor Clegane and has been in Braavos. 

Arya had left Sandor Clegane dying on the banks of the Trident, ""The Hound died there, in my arms"" (AFFC 31/Brienne VI). But it's likely he was speaking metaphorically--the tormented warrior called 'the Hound' died, but Sandor Clegane survived his wounds and was taken to the Quiet Isle to be a brother. The Elder Brother is well aware that many people are hunting Clegane and that Sandor no longer has Arya with him. He wants to both protect Sandor and help Brienne:

&gt;The man you hunt is dead.”

&gt;...“How did he die?”

&gt;“By the sword

&gt;“You know this for a certainty?”

&gt;“I buried him myself. I can tell you where his grave lies, though he may be as dangerous. The riverlands are full of such scavengers. I will not call them wolves. Wolves are nobler than that... and so are dogs, I think. (AFFC 31/Brienne VI)

Later in the same conversation

&gt;All in all, in blood and wine.”

&gt;“When did it change?” asked Brienne.

&gt;“When I died in the Battle of the Trident....I heard hooves behind my back...but before I could turn something slammed into my head and knocked me back into the river

&gt;“Instead I woke here, stripped me of my armor, boots, and breeches, and pushed me back out into the deeper water. The river did the rest. We are all born naked, so I suppose it was only fitting that I come into my second life the same way...” (AFFC 31/Brienne VI)

The Elder Brother was probably not lying about having dug a grave for the Hound. I think he buried Clegane's arms and armor and other belongings in order to symbolically bury his former life. In this way

&gt;...they passed a lichyard where a brother bigger than Brienne was struggling to dig a grave. From the way he moved,” chided Brother Narbert. “Septon Meribald might have gotten a mouthful of dirt.” The gravedigger lowered his head. When Dog went to sniff him he dropped his spade and scratched his ear.

&gt;“A novice

It's significant that Sandor is last seen in a lichyard, he will spend his days burying them. But one could also interpret that scene as one in which Sandor was putting his old self to rest.

Unfortunately

&gt;...was a bitter, but found no pride in service. He fought, but took no joy in victory. He drank, to drown his pain in a sea of wine. He did not love, nor was he loved himself. It was hate that drove him. Though he committed many sins, he never sought forgiveness. Where other men dream of love, or wealth, this man Sandor Clegane dreamed of slaying his own brother

Interestingly, Brienne saw the Hound again:

&gt;One of the shadow men shoved the girl aside. He was clad in rusted rings and a studded belt. At his hip hung longsword and dirk. A yellow greatcloak was plastered to his shoulders

&gt;“No, I killed you.”

&gt;The Hound laughed. “You got that backwards. It’ll be me killing you. I’d do it now

This third Hound turns out to be Lem Lemoncloak:

&gt;The biggest of the four wore a stained and tattered yellow cloak. “Enjoy the food?” he asked. “I hope so. It’s the last food you’re ever like to eat.” He was brown-haired, with a broken nose that had healed badly. I know this man, Brienne thought. “You are the Hound.”

&gt;He grinned. His teeth were awful; crooked

Notice how Lem seems like a scarier figure now. Back in Arya's chapters in ASOS

&gt;“There is nothing good about that helm, and Rorge a beast in human skin.”

&gt;“I’m not them.”

&gt;“Then why show the world their face? Savage, Lem?”

&gt;“The sight of it will make my foes afraid.”

&gt;“The sight of it makes me afraid.” (AFFC 42/Brienne VIII)

* Ser Gregor's skull was allegedly sent to Prince Doran Martell to appease them (although some speculate is was actually Oppo's skull

* Grey Wind's head was sewn onto Robb's corpse after the Red Wedding

* It makes sense for the Lannisters to be in possession of Robb's skull

* The name.  The word 'Stark' in German can be translated to mean Strong.  Thus Robb Stark = Robert Strong

Just as a quick aside I'll explain why I doubt the head sent to Doran was Oppo's

* Whilst it was malformed like Oppos, I still doubt Oppo's skull would be big enough.

* Bran's vision in AGOT speaks of ""a giant in armor made of stone, it clearly alludes to Ser Gregor being decapitated.  Thus it makes it far more likely for Ser Robert Strong to have a new head, thus involving decapitation at some point, rather than never being decapitated at all.

It is well known that King's blood is a powerful agent in blood magic.  It was most likely Khal Drogo's blood that accidently caused the hatching of Danaerys' dragons.  However the fiasco with Khal Drogo also proves that inferior blood used in blood magic results in a inferior result.  Mirri Maz Duur's use of a stallion's blood to merely save Drogo from death resulted in him awakening in a vegetative state.  Also remember that Dany offered her own life to save Drogo's thinking:

 &gt;She told herself she would die for him

Yet Mirri Maz Duur refuses, she would need to use inferior blood.

So if the inferior blood of a stallion cannot succeed in preventing a sick man from dying

Qyburn is well-versed in necromancy, as he remarked that Oberyn most likely used magic in his poison to lengthen Ser Gregor's death.

Thus if Qyburn wished to reanimate Ser Gregor to create the ""unbeatable champion"" for Cersei, with enough mental capacity to fight and follow orders.  The only unaccounted notable source of King's blood we know of so far is Robb Stark's head (which has had a suspicious lack of mention), and sewing the head onto the corpse of Ser Gregor certainly seems a solid way to provide this magic.

Another thematic piece of evidence is the idea of king's blood waking stone.  Khal Drogo's blood awakened Danaerys' dragon eggs

Now I know our knowledge of resurrection is limited, but this is the evidence I've accumulated.  Thoughts?",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,False,TheImp,
1354392686.0,14470f,(Spoilers All) The second most powerful house in each region,Kordyon,283,46,168,"I was thinking about the great houses and liege lords of each of the regions of Westeros.  At the beginning of AGoT we have the Starks, Lannisters, the Starks number four + Jon


If any of these families are extinguished, and (temporarily) Starks, then which houses stand to become the most powerful in the region?  I am not asking which houses will necessarily be given the rule, but rather which is most powerful. For example, Littlefinger is technically the Lord Paramount of the Riverlands, but that does not make his house powerful, as he has no armies and the Riverlords do not seem to respect his authority in any way.

So who are the second most powerful houses in each region?

-
The Riverlands: House Frey. 
-

I'm starting here because it seems to be the most obvious.  The Freys are rich and powerful from the tolls they have collected from the crossing over the years.  They were able to amass approximately 4000 men when Edmure first called the banners way back in AGoT.  For all the fighting in the Riverlands, Riverrun was given to Emmon Frey, and I believe that the Riverlords will ultimately follow whoever holds Riverrun, not LF and Harrenhal.  I actually believe that the Freys are the most powerful ""non-Great"" house in this list.

Honorable Mention: House Mallister

-
The Vale: House Royce.  
-

Stinky Pinky's machinations aside, I believe Bronze Yohn is the clear frontrunner for stewardship and possibly lordship of the Vale.

Honorable Mentions: House Hunter

-
The North: House Bolton.  
-
The Boltons are the clear winners in this category by the end of ADwD, I feel as if this category would be a toss up between the Umbers, the Boltons, and the Karstarks in terms of sheer numbers/strength.  However, this is definitely a case of brains over brawns and R&amp;R Bolton have definitely cemented themselves as the house to beat in the North.

Honorable Mentions: House Umber

-
The Iron Islands: House Harlaw.  
-
This is a case where being the most powerful won't necessarily equate to being the ruler.  Rodrik Harlaw seems to be one of the most intelligent men on the Iron Islands (with the exception of Euron), including Ser Rodrik's home of Ten Towers.  All of the other houses on the Isle of Harlaw pledge fealty to Ser Rodrik.  All of these things combine to make House Harlaw the second most powerful on the Iron Islands, but the Ironborn seem more impressed with powerful individuals than powerful houses.

-
The Reach: House Hightower.  
-
This was a tough one to decide.  The Redwynes have played a big role in the story so far as being the naval power behind the Tyrell strength.  However, the Arbor has already been attacked by the Ironborn and the Redwyne fleet will certainly sustain further losses at the hands of Euron Crow's Eye before all is said and done.  Add this to the fact that, as an island, the Arbor is slightly isolated from the rest of the Reach, whereas Oldtown is on the mainland and I think that we have to recognize House Hightower as the No. 2 in the Reach behind the Tyrells.

Honorable Mentions: House Redwyne

-
Dorne: House Yronwood.  
-
Yronwood is at an important strategic position at the mouth of the Boneway Pass so it has been the ancient responsibility of House Yronwood to guard the pass against intruders from the North.  This has been a very important task given the long-time on and off conflict between the Reach and Dorne.  Thus

Honorable Mention: House Dayne

-
The Westerlands: Undecided. 
-
 I tried doing some research on this one and I am unable to come to a firm conclusion.  It seems to me that the Lannisters are so dominant and prolific in the Westerlands that they allow their bannermen as little power as possible.  Possibilities include House Brax, House Clegane, and House Payne.  Of these, I would probably pick House Brax, but I would love to hear any other ideas on this.

-
Crownlands/Stormlands: House Velaryon. 
- 
If I remember correctly, I imagine that the Velaryons would attempt to take control of Dragonstone.  Furthermore, Aurane Waters is currently MIA with the newly made Royal Fleet and he is a bastard of House Velaryon.  We do not know how loyal he is to House Velaryon, but he could be a wildcard asset for them.

Honorable Mentions: House Swann

*edit: I've decided to go through with the debates


***

Would people be interested in a regular (every 1-2 weeks) topic thread where we host a *moderated* debate on a specific subject? The difference between this type of debate and your average back-and-forth is that the debate is moderated, a winner is chosen based on voting.

First we would select our debate topic, just so we don't see the same people arguing every topic. I was thinking only one champion per side for simplicity, but if the topic calls for it we could do 2-on-2.

It would follow an adapted version of the Oxford style debate format. If you're familiar with the popular Intelligence Squared debates they follow the same format. It goes as follows:

1. **Moderator Opening Words:** Introduce proposition and give brief background information.
* **Opening Vote:** Users vote on proposition (for
* **Opening Statements:** Pre-written opening statements from both sides (limited word count).
* **Floor Debate:** Moderator questions, number of questions, and can decide if a topic needs to move on to a different area. Predetermined time limit for all of this (~1-2 hours).
* **Closing Arguments:** Each champion presents his/her last argument.
* **Closing Vote:** Users vote on proposition one last time.
* **Winner Declared:** The winner of the debate is the side that *sways* the highest percentage of people to their side.

To clarify how a winner is determined, and 8% undecided. The closing vote is 10% for, 88% against, and 2% undecided. The winner would be the champion arguing for Benjen=Daario, because his/her arguments swayed more people.

The type of debate topics I had in mind would be along the lines of:

* Sexism in ASOIAF
* Who is the better player
* Is [blank] (e.g. Stannis
* Various contested theories (e.g. R+L=J

I'm sure there are plenty of good debate topics we could choose from. So is this something that interests people? If so I can put it all together,False,self,t5_2r2o9,1367327849.0,,EuronCrowsEye,t3_1dar6n

**A GAME OF THRONES**

* The man with the yellow beard Arya follows in the dungeons – Lannister?
* I think Robb &amp; Catelyn will have to, i.e. do something that makes Cersei/Joff kill her.
* R + L = J and that’s a fact. [[I don't remember exactly what this was a response to?]]
* Not that it’s important
* Mya Stone
* Old Mormont says Jorah was married to a “vain woman”(pg 561) – who?
* It seems weird that Robb isn’t a narrator and yet playing such an important part. It’d also be a waste of narrator if Bran did nothing important. So I think in a few books’ time when Bran’s old enough, they probably aren’t.
* Ew
* Hypothesis: Everybody mentioned in the appendix will be at least mentioned in the actual books. This explains bannermen and such
 * Mya Stone
 * Joy (father: Gerion Lannister)
 * Garse&amp;Garrett Flowers (father: Garth Tyrell)
* Ending thought: It's really heartbreaking how Tyrion is essentially paying Shae to be his girlfriend.
* Something I noticed: Whenever a character dreams about the future

**A CLASH OF KINGS**

* This prologue has nothing to do with anything or anybody I know.
* Okay no
* I wonder if Melisandre used magic/miracle or just had built up an immunity?
* Some way or another
* Yup
* Are you allowed to root for Tyrion
* Theon *will* be forced to go against the Starks. And have to choose. And it *won't* be an easy choice.
* Littlefinger is DEFINITELY the chessmaster. He has the money
* Dontos just offered Sansa a way home. She's dreaming about the future. It will not happen.
* I'm at page 334
* Arya will never reach Winterfell
* Theon is such a manwhore but holy shit he's funny!
* THIS IS SO GROSS AND UNCOMFORTABLE I HATE ASHA
* ...I kinda want *Tyrion* as King-in-the-South (and Robb in the North
* Dany will be so disappointed when she actually sees the Seven Kingdoms.
* Well holy fuck Renly just died. This ""Light God"" is evil sorcery. Reminds me of Mirri Maz Duur - Melisandre must be a maegi because of the deadly shadows.
* That green dream - if Bran&amp;Rickon die
* Seems like I had too much faith in Theon's Starkness.
* Pg 571
* Pg 623
* Pg 706
* Characters and their Hogwarts Houses:
 * Catelyn - Hufflepuff (because family and duty)
 * Robb&amp;Ned - Gryffindor (this is what killed Ned!)
 * Sam Tarly - Ravenclaw
 * Every single Lannister except Joffrey - Slytherin (this is not a bad thing
 * Littlefinger - Slytherin I guess? We don't know his plans and motives and values
* Jon's too much like Ned
* Well FUCK. Bran &amp; Rickon are dead. FUCK Theon Greyjoy
* Catelyn-talking-to-Jaime
* BRAN &amp; RICKON AREN'T DEAD! THEY LIVE! I still want Theon and the other Greyjoys to die or at least lose

Regarding identity and becoming a Faceless Man: 

The common belief is that in order for Arya, she must give up her whole identity and sincerely become ""no one."" However, while doing a combined AFFC/ADWD re-read, this passage in AFFC with Arya and the waif really stood out to me:

&gt;One day at supper [the waif] turned to Arya and asked
&gt;""No one
&gt;""You lie
&gt;Arya laughed. ""Gooder? You mean *better*
&gt;""Better stupid. I will show you.""
&gt;The next day they began the lying game, sometimes they would lie. The questioner had to try and tell what was true and what was false. The waif always seemed to know. Arya had to guess. Most of the time she guessed wrong. 

- AFFC

This made me think that perhaps she *doesn't* have to become no one. ""Who are you?"" ""No one."" ""You lie."" She has to learn how to lie well enough that this obvious lie - because no one is truly no one - is believed to be the truth.

But note the chronology: Tywin is furious at Tyrion's demand *before* Oberyn Martell shocks them by agreeing to champion Tyrion.  Tyrion also hypothesizes that Tywin thought he would ""go meekly"":

&gt;  Did you think I would go meekly

But again

There are two possibilities:

1.  Tywin wanted Tyrion to take the black.  This seems plausible, Tywin does not urge him to confess - he asks him if he's gone crazy.

2.  Tywin was planning to have Tyrion acquitted somehow, so he'd surely realize that a trial by combat would be the obvious fallback for a man with no other options - a man who was facing a jury sure to convict him.  Is it possible that Tywin was planning to somehow convince Tyrell to vote against convicting Tyrion (only convincing Oberyn would have sewn emnity between Dorne and Martell).  If Oberyn and Martell had both voted innocent, Tyrion would have gotten off and no one could say it was just Tywin favoring his son.

The other evidence in favor of this theory is that Tyrion's trial follows Tywin essentially 'disowning' Jaime.  Tywin NEEDS an heir to Casterly Rock.  Could it be that he was coming around to the idea of Tyrion inheriting the Rock after all?  I doubt he'd want to leave it to Lancel or another relative - he definitely respects Tyrion's intelligence and cunning.

1375797216.0,1jt77e,(Spoilers All) A People's History of Westeros,BryndenBFish,273,43,79,"Introduction
-

&gt; ""The history of any country, most often repressed) between conquerors and conquered, masters and slaves, capitalists and workers, dominators and dominated in race and sex."" - Howard Zinn, [A People's History of the United States](http://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/zinncol1.html)

One of the more enjoyable (if not the most enjoyable for me) aspect of ASOIAF is the in-book history of the realm. It's a testament to GRRM's love of real-world history that the history of Westeros is so fascinating to the reader. But there are problems with what's presented. The history of Westeros, nobly and died on the Trident? Do they have strong opinions on whether Robert was right to rebel against the Targaryens? How did they view Aegon's original conquest? How will the Smallfolk remember the events of the Seven Books?
____

The Areo Hotah Problem
-

&gt; Areo Hotah did not know what to say to that. He was only a captain of guards, Chapter 2, The Captain of Guards*

Though a foreigner to Westeros, servile, obedient and answer the lord's call militarily when needed. The major complaint about Areo as a POV is that he is mostly there to observe the events of House Martell, and yet I wonder whether Areo might serve (probably unintentional) purpose of showing the nobility's concept of how regular folks should act. The history of Westeros, as told by the nobility, is one of dynastic power struggle and war between great houses and great lords. The Smallfolk endured and served the great lords often at a much greater expense than the lords they served.

Broken Men: the People's Perspective of History
-

&gt; ""They have little to touch, they live, they love, they die. They know Lord Mooton rules their lands, but few have ever seen him, and Riverrun and King's Landing are only names to them."" - *AFFC, Chapter 25

Though the historical perspective is limited

Through Meribald's perspective

&gt; ""They've heard the songs and stories, of the wealth and glory they will win. War seems a fine adventure, the greatest most of them will ever know.""

To the Smallfolk of Westeros, nasty brutish lives that they endured previously. Through war, they lose their identity as Smallfolk and begin to commit the various crimes and brutalities that they endured previously.

&gt; ""If they want new boots or a warmer cloak or maybe a rusted iron halfhelm, from the smallfolk whose lands they're fighting in, men very like the men they used to be. They slaughter their sheep and steal their chickens, and from there it's just a short step to carrying off their daughters too.""

During the war, they had no hold to return to, no family name to rely on for protection, and God forbid they were captured. Tyrion makes this comment on the War of the Five Kings:

&gt; ""That was the way of war. The smallfolk were slaughtered, Tyrion V*

And in the end

&gt; ""The War of the Ninepenny Kings?"" asked Hyle Hunt.

&gt; ""So they called it, though. That it was.""

Conclusion
-

There is no possible way to craft a full or really a good incomplete history of Westeros as seen through the people's perspective. I hope that [The World of Ice and Fire](http://www.amazon.com/The-World-Ice-Fire-Official/dp/0553805444) may contain something of a people's perspective on past events, is the history of the nobility. The peasant classes of Europe in the Middle Ages didn't have time to write down their thoughts of events as they happened. They were too busy surviving than to learn to read and write. The same goes for the people of Westeros. But their perspective, though under-documented, is important and enriches our understanding of Westeros.",,False,self,False,t3_1jt77e

* In AFFC, gruff of speech"" to Cersei. The chief undergoaler, Rennifer Longwaters, gives a similar description to Jaime, consistent with that of Varys in AGOT.
* Both Qyburn and Longwaters note that Rugen held his appointment of the old king
* Qyburn says that Rugen came and went as he pleased, such as Ned Stark, Pycelle and Tyrion. That would make sense if Rugen was just an alias, as Varys could hardly spend all his time pretending to be a gaoler.

So

1. Qyburn discovers a gold coin, which is exactly what happens. Seems pretty straightforward. Though there's always the slim chance that the Varys is somehow involved in the [Tyrell Conspiracy](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/8204-grand-tyrell-conspiracy-theory/), but I doubt it.

&gt; ""Vile?"" Colemon blinked at her

He is obviously uncomfortable and seemingly hurries to changed the subject. Sansa doesn't seem to notice anything and doesn't bring it up again. He brings up the bloody nose later on:

So we know the following: that Littlefinger expects Robert to die, just that he was his personal Maester by his death), and that Colemon was evasive about what he gave Robert.

My theory is that Colemon is in Littlefinger's pocket and has been for some time. And that he has slowly been poisoning Robert and causing his illness for some time.

I didn't end up asking anything because, I took pretty extensive notes and figured I'd share them. Nothing earth-shattering

**Reading:**

He read two chapters from TWoW. One was the full version of the Victarion chapter that's been going around (I'm not sure where it is online - I downloaded a PDF someone posted here). The other was a Tyrion chapter. Both were set-up chapters for the battle of Mereen

**Victarion:** this chapter takes place on a ship. Victarion calls three thralls to his cabin and orders them to blow the dragon horn. Each will blow it once, goes to the deck, the war drums start beating and they prepare to attack. It was a pretty badass ending.

**Tyrion:** This scene takes place in Brown Ben Plumm's tent. He and Tyrion are playing cevasse. This chapter seemed to have 3 major plot points:

- Setting the stage for what's going on in Mereen

- Tyrion begins trying to persuade Brown Ben to go turn cloak again and go back to Dany

- Jorah shows up at the end and tells them that there are ships in the bay with black sails and kraken sigils and everyone goes ""what the fuuuuuck?""

**Fun tidbits from the Q&amp;A

- Morrocco will be the location for the Slaver's Bay cities next season.

- Apparently

- Victarion is ""dumb as a stump."" I think this tells us everything we need to know about his eventual fate (my thoughts

- He was asked a bunch of questions about his writing process. He told us that he does, but not how it will get there. He said it would be like if he drove from Seattle to NYC - he'd know the destination and the general route, but not everything that was going to happen along the way. He also said that his characters were ""treacherous"" and sometimes forced him to change his plans. :)

- One of my favorite questions was about Howland Reed. A woman asked if his children might know anything about what happened at the Tower of Joy. He scoffed a little and said he couldn't tell us that

- He assured us that we will learn about Jon's parentage: ""all will be revealed.""

- Someone asked if he reads fan theories and he said no, so he just stays away.

Whew, but still, interesting stuff.

EDIT: a few points others made

- Samer791 made [a separate post](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/w0ply/football_reference_the_life_of_the_triarch/) about the Bill Belichik connection.

- It may have been both krakens and dragons on the sails of Victarion's fleet.

- I thought this was funny. Someone asked a question about Renly and Loras' relationship. GRRM said that he gets lots of emails asking him for some explicit sex scenes between men in future books. He deadpanned: ""these always come from female fans.""

but how much actual sex is there in the books? from the top of my head i can remember only like 6 or 7 sex scenes in +4200 pages.

is that fact that a novel does not completly ignores the topic of sex (like most literature) make it seems loaded with sex? this may be me just not being from the USA but i did not think that the books where all about senselessness sex.

&gt;“I can describe an axe entering a human skull in great explicit detail and no one will blink twice at it. I provide a similar description, and I get letters about it and people swearing off. To my mind this is kind of frustrating, it’s madness. Ultimately, in the history of [the] world, penises entering vaginas have given a lot of people a lot of pleasure; axes entering skulls, well, not so much.”

One thing I have noticed though is the irony. The irony of all deaths. 

When people die

To make somewhat of a list.

**Lysa Arryn/Baelish/Tully** Killed by her lover

**Tywin Lannister** Proud lord Tywin died with a whore in his bed while taking a dump. His corpse smelled bad and the never smiling lord's corpse had a stupid grin on his face.

**Ned Stark** The honorable Lord Stark was forced to admit to a crime and dishonor he never committed and still lost his head when Joffrey didn't keep his promise of Mercy. 

**Robb Stark** The honorable Robb, who beheaded one of his most loyal bannermen for honor, who never lost a battle, in the end lost his head and kingdom when two of his bannermen who dishonored themselves by breaking the most sacred of wows. 

**Quentynn Martell** Goes around the world to take his place besides the Dragon Queen

**Khal Drogo** The most fierce warrior in the world, fell from his horse and was in the end suffocated by a woman. 

**Joffrey** The proud king, his final words calling for his mommy. 

**Catelyn** (Disregard the Lady Stoneheart part, there doesn't seem to be much of Catelyn left in Stoneheart) Refused to go to the Twins to look at brides for Robb, refused to go back to Winterfell because Robb needed her more than Bran and Rickon. Died at the Twins when Robb married another woman. Died believing that Bran and Rickon were dead. Died believing that all her children but Sansa were dead. Died unaware of that the only child to die was Robb, whom she was there to look after.



**With this in mind

**Carsei** Runs around all her life trying to protect her children and herself from Tyrion

**Walder Frey** Tries to build a dynasty. Betrays Robb Stark to get a better postion. Sees his house crumble before him

**Ramsay Snow/Bolton** After spending his entire life trying to was away the Title ""Bastard of Bolton"" he is finally killed by the Bastard of Stark


**EDIT. As there has been some confusions to this

**Robert Baratheon** Killed by his vices. Women

**Viserys Targaryen** Khal Drogon gave him his golden crown as he was promised.

I have just watched episode 9 and was wondering if Robb did warg into his wolf because after Greywind died Robb was still alive inside the castle.

I think however that when Robb was unconscious he warged into his wolf

Further evidence of this is that when Jon killed Orell he went into his eagle and attacked him again

Any thoughts?

Edit: Sorry I get confused with all the different characters I meant Orell not Varamyr

Also I would like to add I am not trying to read into this too far or anything I was merely stating that that's what I think happened on the TV show and I think it makes it all a lot more emotional and sad.

A lot of people have said that because we didn't see Robb do the white eye thing for warging is proof he didn't warg but when Robb was collapsing and on the floor in the hall we didn't see his face. I still maintain that because of the order of scenes and the behaviour of GW and Robb's actions that he warged into GW as he was being attacked.

That being said I DO NOT think Robb said 'Mother' to warn her about Arya

I think the creators of the show put this in to make it more sad and emotional for us book readers (and possibly show readers if they could pick up on it which is doubtful) and when I was watching it I immediately thought it was Robb in GW.

The Mountain murdered, probably murdered his sister and father, burned half of his brother's face off, raped and murdered Princess Elia with the brains of her child on his hands and probably a million other horrible things along with his merry crew of psychopaths.

Qyburn... His experiments... Let's just call him a Mengele expy and a sick fuck and leave it at that. 

Cersei has sex with her brother, turns over innocent people and friends over to Qyburn for torture, abuses Sansa and through her sheer incompetence turns the realm into a giant clusterfuck.

Tywin (Jesus, sacked King's Landing, protected monsters like Amory Lorch and Gregor Clegane so he could unleash them on innocent people... 

Walder Frey turned on Robb due to the insult to his honor and broke the most ancient law of Westeros in the Red Wedding, only his ability to keep churning out kids. 

Craster rapes his daughters to breed more wives for himself and gives the boys as human sacrifices to the Others. 

Pretty much any of the Masters of Mereen

Last, and I'm guessing that more than a few readers were extremely disturbed by him. Listing all of the awful things that he's done would be too time consuming, so please, feel free to reference them in your arguments. 

Edit: After reading through some of the comments

Rorge is certainly awful and evil, his treatment/raising of Biter, his numerous rapes and murders certainly put him on the list, which leads to...

Ser Amory Lorch is probably best known in Westeros for his brutal murder of the Princess Rhaenys, and Lorch hanged the couple with him. 

The best that can be said of the Mountain's men is that they aren't as vile as the Brave Companions. When you consider just how awful many of the Mountain's men are

The road he was walking down was one he would probably be unhappy with as he added pages to the white book.

Her theory was

The Seven of Westeros are as follows

 &gt;**Father**, and is prayed to for justice.

&gt;**Mother**, and is depicted as smiling with love, embodying the concept of mercy.

&gt;**Warrior**

&gt;**Maiden**

&gt;**Smith**

&gt;**Crone**

&gt;**Stranger**. An exception to the other aspects


Rules:

*The character must be alive at the end of aDwD (Jon Snow being the exception

*The character has to be a major character 


*Hard mode: The character has to have a PoV chapter



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My lineup is as follows...

**The Father** - Jon Snow - This has been my pick since before I finished aDwD, even with his current complications.

**The Mother** - Dany - this one is easy

**The Maiden** - Sansa - She's all about being a Lady, though I have my doubts about Sansa.

**The Warrior** - Jaimie -  I would really like Jamie Lannister here

**The Smith** - Tyrion - This is where it gets messy. Ideally, who represents the Smith in the Stark family paradigm, is still alive (for all we know), but once again, not a PoV character. This would leave Tyrion as the obvious choice. He had the chain built, and he seems like he's about to forge some new alliances with Dany in the future. 

**The Crone** - Bran - Bran represents the Crone in the Stark family

**The Stranger** - Arya - Who is she? Nobody. I don't think she's making it back to Westeros anytime soon, and she's going to leave a trail of bodies behind her.

It is true that there are a lot of influences of the War of the Roses: The Council, even the names of two of the main houses Lannister (Lancaster) and Stark (York). But there are so many other influences, especially of Britain’s history, but also of Europe’s history.

For a start

The first humans to arrive to Westeros are the First Men, they manage to settle an agreement with them, it is important to point out that they adopt the Children’s religion. The First Men can easily be identified with the Celts, a Bronze Age people originating in Central Europe which expanded through most Western Europe, including the British Isles. When the Celts arrived to Britain and Ireland they met pre-Celtic peoples which had been in the Isles for hundreds of years, among which the most known are the Picts. The Celts adopted the Drudistic religion of these pre-Celtic peoples just as the First Men adopted the Children’s religion. Both religions are similar, having strong views in the divine aspect of mother nature

The language of the First Men is just spoken by the wildlings North of the Wall, dark haired and medium to light eyed. They worship the old gods, probably a Forest Children cultural influence, not a rare phenotype in the British Isles.

The Andals come with the second colonization wave. They are a tall, let’s remember that the Germanic tribes that invaded Britain, the Angles, the Saxons and the Jutes, came from Jutland (Denmark), Northern Germany and Frisland. Even their name, Andals, one of the Germanic tribes that invaded the Roman Empire.

The Andals worship the Seven, that’s why the Northerners remain loyal to the Old Gods, just like the Scoti/Picti remained loyal to the Druidistic tradition and to the Celtic Gods. The Anglo-Saxons organized themselves in Seven Kingdoms just like Westeros is divided in the Seven Kingdoms.

The third and last colonization wave comes under the Warrior Queen Nymeria

The last of the invaders is Aegon Targaryen, Velaryons, etc.), and with the strong dragons, they come from Dragonstone, although their ancestral homeland is Valyria.  It doesn’t take a genious to identify Aegon with William the Conqueror, of Norman/Viking stock, and not with dragons but with war boats with dragon heads

Valyrians have their own traditions and language, which remained as the King’s court language for hundreds of years, being of Scandinavian stock, they are as fair as one can be.

This is just a small example of how ASOIAF has so many other influences than the War of the Roses, the Free Cities with the Renaissance Italian city-states, and so many other things.",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/141sls/spoilers_all_asoiaf_much_more_than_the_war_of_the/
1343590111.0,xcpqj,(Spoilers ALL)  Ser Jaime has a dream in ASOS...,bass_voyeur,254,37,38,"TL;DR  Ser Jaime's dream in ASOS was not a fever dream

This is long...

After leaving Harrenhal

&gt;A grove of trees... The moonlight glimmered pale upon the stump where Jaime had rested his head.  The moss covered it so thickly he had not noticed before

The dream Jaime is one of the longest dream sequences in all of ASOIAF and touches on much of Jaime's current state of mind/personality including: guilt over his failed oath to Aerys and the Kingsguard, the burden of Casterly Rock and his father, and Brienne.  Arguably, this dream and his decision afterward, is his turning point as a character.  He turns back to Harrenhal to save Brienne and symbolically begins turning his back to Casterly Rock and Cersei.

Given the above passage

1. The dead old tree is described as white and is in a grove which shares characteristics with the grove of weirwoods north of the Wall (AGOT, the weirwood in the Frostfangs (ACOK Jon), and 

2. Ned Stark is specifically referenced both in the dream and after the dream.  Further

Given that we know that weirwoods are the source of power for greenseers from ADWD and the Bran/Bloodraven passages.  We know that greenseers have a pseudo-communication with the living via the dialogue from Bran to Jon Snow in ACOK (the passage where Bran encourages Jon to use his 3rd eye in the Frostfangs) and a passage from ADWD where Theon feels the presence of Bran from the weirwood in Winterfell.

I speculate that the dream Jaime has is no fever dream

1. Jaime thinks and dreams of Ned Stark, I think that Ned represents both the North and the old gods to Jaime; if he had a dream from the old gods, this may be a deliberate connection.  

2. He also asks Qyburn what might be an embarrassing question regarding the existence of ghosts.  Remember that Jaime up until recently has been so full of pride that he withholds most comments about his true thoughts from Catelyn

3.  In our ASOIAF passages, Theon, and Jon with Sansa and Sam also having connections with weirwoods.

I think that with Jaime having slept on a weirwood, connecting that dream to Ned and the old gods, and with ADWD evidence that Bran and Bloodraven communicate through weirwoods, we have ***reasonable*** evidence to believe that Jaime had some old god dream.

1370881446.0,1g1wd7,(Spoilers All) A new take on Tyrion's birth,AdmiralMackbar,285,71,151,"I had a thought while watching this scene from the season 3 finale:

---

Tywin: The house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first. A good man does everything in his power to better his family's position

[Tyrion looks away with a smirk.]

Tywin: Does that *amuse* you?

Tyrion: No

Tywin: Easy for me

Tyrion: When have you ever done something that wasn't in your interests

Tywin: The day that you were born!

[There is a pause

Tywin: I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away.

---

What if that was a deflection of what Tywin was about to confess? What if, knowing it would sacrifice Joanna, the only woman he ever loved, for their child, a stranger? What if Tywin is one of the few men we have met who chose duty over love when the choice was hard? What if Tyrion is a reminder to Tywin of that choice in the same way Jon is a reminder to Cat of Ned's indiscretion?

We are repeatedly confronted with the choice between family and honor; love and duty. For our favorite characters, Jon betrays his vows to protect Arya. (For Jon, we actually get to witness this choice in his final chapter, which I found particularly heartbreaking; I recently took a close look at this choice here: http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1fyo4i/spoilers_all_the_death_of_duty_a_mosaic_of/)

But for Tywin Lannister, and we are introduced to the man he has become decades later. All that Pycelle does seems rooted in his educated opinion that Tywin is such a man:

From the second post, and with the exception of Bethany, most of them die young without children.  Gyles Rosby, the head of house Rosby, didn't have an heir.  They don't have much land or wealth from what I can see.  House Rosby is very weak politically and physically.

Looking at the previous wives (Royce, Blackwood, Whent- in order),  Walder's marriages get progressively worse and worse, so far as house name goes.  House Royce is a very old and powerful house, and Swann is also old and powerfu.  Marrying a woman from house Crakehall was a downgrade for ol' Walder; at this point, he already has five sons, Crakehalls are known for their robustness, a good match, nobody wants to marry their daughters to an old man with dozens of heirs.

Anyway, even if she is pretty.  She does give him a child every year, but the damage is done; Walder's delicate pride is hurt!  He feels that he's married beneath himself.  As a result, he resents the children of Bethany Rosby.  He allows Bethany to raise the children as she pleases, resulting in a bunch of kids that actually aren't half bad, as far as Freys go.

So what does Walder do with these misfit kids?  He gets rid of them.  He sends the sons away whenever possible, because she looks just like her mother.  Roslin is a reminder to Walder that his wives just ain't what they used to be.

I'll start with the passage:

&gt;Roose Bolton removed a ragged strip of leather from the pouch at his belt. “My son sent this with his letter.” Ser Wendel turned his fat face away. Robin Flint and Smalljon Umber exchanged a look, against the lives of two young princes? You were their mother, my lady. May I offer you this . . . small token of revenge?” Part of Catelyn wanted to clutch the grisly trophy to her heart, but she made herself resist. “Put it away. Please.” “Flaying Theon will not bring my brothers back,” Robb said. “I want his head, not his skin.” “He is Balon Greyjoy’s only living son,” Lord Bolton said softly, “and now rightful King of the Iron Islands. A captive king has great value as a hostage.”


And with that the mater is whisked away and quickly forgotten. At my first reading I barely cared

This is a very standard trope in a lot of literature and other media. Some minor villain gets his comeuppance and we don't really see it happen, or we hear about it second hand before moving on. So when Theon has been captured and is being flayed for his crimes. I didn't really think about it, or care. But think about it.

Even without what we now know this is beyond horrible. Ramsey's murderous

And Theon really isn't **that** bad a character, did he really need to be **flayed**?

But we don't think of any of this because who cares about some minor character being tortured a bit for murder? Then Reek comes a long and, poor poor Theon. But by this time you've long forgotten this passage until you come back to it. GRRM put this in not because it foreshadows what's coming (though it does). It's far less subtle then almost all of his foreshadowing in the books. I believe this passage exists for when you reread the book. So that you can examine your attitudes towards characters you don't really care about.

So often in literature and in life we ignore bad things happening to bad people without really considering it. Most people are not purely evil, or bad but with some good. When we think of WWII we don't consider that every Nazi shot was a man, a lot were just men who needed money, or were proud of their country. They didn't realize they were on the bad side, and thousands of them were shot, and bled to death in the muck, and who cares? Had to be done!

Not to be overly political but an example is Obama and his drone attacks, but it's not like Obama gets off on it, he's doing what he thinks is right. Yet somewhere across the world some little kid got ripped in half by an explosion he had nothing to do with, he experienced that pain, actual true horrible pain.

I think this passage is to remind us of how we ignore the pain of those we deem unimportant. Anyways,False,self,t5_2r2o9,False,,Bloodraven,t3_14iekt

1329260685.0,ppt6y,(spoilers: all) The North remembers,,247,34,81,"I wanted to get feedback on a theory that the northern nobility is conspiring against the Boltons and planning to reinstall the Starks to power. This theory is drawn from [this very interesting thread](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/59217-the-northmen-inside-and-outside-winterfell-conspiration/)
 
1. Lord Manderly reveals to Davos that he is still loyal to the Starks and is planning on betraying the Boltons and Freys. I think it's unlikely that the Manderlys and Glovers (Robett is with Wyman) are wholly alone on this project to reinstate a Stark in Winterfell. (ADWD Davos IV).

    Interestingly, the elder brother, is also alive. Seemingly, Manderly makes no plans to look for Bran. Or at least, he doesn't reveal any such plans to Davos. He also makes no mention of Jon Snow, who could easily confirm the identities of any Stark children, whether they have direwolves or not.

2. The northmen who are with Stannis demonstrate that they're still loyal to the Starks. They are really only with him in order to rescue Arya and to take Winterfell from the Boltons (ADWD

3. Bran and company meet up with a Liddle (one of the northern mountain clans) while they're on their way north. It is likely that the man knew who Bran was--the direwolf accompanying them is a dead giveaway. The Liddle mentions how much better things used to be when there was a Stark in Winterfell (ASOS

4. Lady Barbrey Dustin's odd behavior at Winterfell (ADWD, who, besides being a stranger, is a known turncloak and Bolton lackey. It's possible she told him about her hatred of the Starks in order to allay Bolton suspicions about her loyalty. After all, her husband (William Dustin) had apparently been close enough to Ned that he was brought along to the Tower of Joy. Yes, she claims to despise Eddard because her husband died in his service, but that seems weirdly irrational. The risk of your husband dying in service to his liege lord is just part of the price of being the wife of a lesser lord.

     You could argue that Barbrey's just vindictive and crazy, Cerwyns, Tallharts, Slates, Hornwoods, Umbers, and Ryswells also had relatives who were guests at the Red Wedding (ADWD ""A Ghost in Winterfell""). 

    If Lady Dustin is working with Manderly

    Second, really wants to check out the Stark crypts, but her visit seems oddly pointless. She talks some more about how much she dislikes the Starks and notice that some swords are missing. But let's say Lady Dustin is working with Manderly. Lord Manderly has Wex, who saw Bran et al. talking to Maester Luwin in Winterfell's godswood (ACOK, last Bran chapter). They told Luwin that they'd been hiding in the Stark crypts. Maybe *that's* why Lady Dustin needed to go see the crypts in ADWD--she was assigned to find evidence that someone had been hiding down there. The missing swords corroborate Wex's story (and the Liddle man's too). Now they know for sure that Rickon and Bran were not killed by Theon.

5. Theon sees Whoresbane quietly talking to Harwood Stout--who is a bannerman to Lady Dustin--after Ramsay's wedding (ADWD ""The Turncloak""). Maybe this means nothing, and Manderly are all conspiring together?

6. There's some weirdness going on with a couple of letters that the Boltons sent to Jon (ADWD, both letters are signed by Whoresbane Umber, who is a reluctant ally of the Boltons due to the Greatjon being captive at the Twins. He signs with a crudely drawn version of his house sigil, even though he once studied to be a maester at the Citadel. It would be implausible for him to be illiterate, but maybe this is just how Umbers sign their names. 

    But here's another bit of weirdness: the 'wedding announcement' Ramsay sent to Jon has the signature of *Lord* Dustin (ADWD, but why did she sign it like this? Is this just a typo? Or was it meant to be some sort of message to Jon? Perhaps Lady Dustin was counting on Jon knowing that that Lord Dustin is dead and to be suspicious of anything Ramsay says. If so, it's too bad he didn't notice--this might've made him more cautious about that final letter from Ramsay at the end of ADWD.

So what do you all think? Does the north remember? Is a sigil just a sigil? Or will *The Winds of Winter* reveal there's been a vast northern conspiracy in the works?",self,t5_2r2o9,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/ppt6y/spoilers_all_the_north_remembers/
1371156815.0,1gakpm,[Spoilers All] Theon's (possible) new heir,Kralizecc,264,55,92,"I'll admit this is a bit unlikely/tinfoily

In ACOK Theon arrives on the Iron Islands on a trading vessel called the Myraham. During this voyage he repeatedly sleeps with the captain's maiden daughter

The Myraham is prevented from leaving the Iron Islands to keep Balon's new rebellion a secret. The Myraham escapes months(?) later during the confusion of Balon's death and Euron's return. I believe that the captain's daughter ran away (or was disowned by her father) to live on Pyke. If she was pregnant it is extremely likely that the child is Theon's.


&gt;He put an arm around the captain’s daughter. “Summon me when we make Lordsport, while her father watched them go in sullen silence.

&gt;The cabin was the captain’s, but she had come to his bed willingly enough all the same. A cup of wine, a few whispers, and there she was. The girl was a shade plump for his taste, with skin as splotchy as oatmeal, but her breasts filled his hands nicely and **she had been a maiden the first time he took her**. That was surprising at her age, but Theon found it diverting. **He did not think the captain approved, watching the man struggle to swallow his outrage while performing his courtesies to the high lord

The captain is outraged at the disrespect and general douchyness of Theon

&gt;“Take me with you, and be your salt wife.” She reached out to stroke his cheek.

&gt;Theon Greyjoy pushed her hand aside and climbed off the bunk. “My place is Pyke

&gt;“I can’t stay here now.”

&gt;He laced up his breeches. “Why not?”

&gt;**“My father, milord. He’ll call me names and hit me.”**

&gt;Theon swept his cloak off its peg and over his shoulders. “Fathers are like that, so he left her there.

If the captain was abusive before

A few weeks later Theon walks past the ship with Asha
&gt;Theon quickened his stride as they neared the Myraham
merchantmen that called at Lordsport had been allowed to depart again; his father wanted no word of the hosting to reach the mainland before he was ready to strike.

&gt;“Milord, but whenever Theon came to Lordsport he spied her wandering forlornly about the deck. “Milord, a moment,” she called after him. “As it please milord...”

&gt;“Did she?” Esgred asked as Theon hurried her past the cog. “Please milord?”

Catelyn II



I always found Cat's POV to be the most consistently harrowing to read. Her cataclysmic griefs and worries are inescapable and on top of that she must function as a major strategist in a war. Robb is the only child she has access to but for him she must hide her fears and pain to advise him as a king while her husband and other children are dead or in the hands of enemies. Cat's priorities in order are the words of House Tully, Honour*, and for most of the time we know her the Stark family is scattered, leaving her to struggle with duty and honour alone. One of the biggest mindfucks of the series for me was fleetingly experiencing the united and content Stark family then realising the relentless extent to which Gurm splits the pack. Catelyn's chapters embody this shock and pain.

1354854092.0,14fdh1,Identity in ASOIAF (Spoilers All),unhappystarfish,273,62,53,"We’ve all been doing a fair bit of theorizing on character identities on this subreddit, to the point where that’s not fruitful anymore either. Instead of complaining about this more, just as useful as theorizing about characters.

Without further ado, dealing with many facets of identity, such as who a person really is, how that person views him or herself, whether you shape yourself or not, and more. Unfortunately, I’m a college student, so I can’t go as in depth as I’d like to with this, but I can only work on it very late at night

First and foremost, and so I rely on it heavily when casting judgments on any character. I’d like to review a few characters in terms of this quote. For the sake of making my argument, I’m going to try to pair up characters in ways that helps prove my point.

We’ll start, it cannot be said that Tyrion does not know who he is. On the contrary, he has a very firm grasp of his skills, limitations, and how others view him. Of course, Tyrion makes mistakes, as everyone does. However

Opposing Tyrion is Cersei, exceedingly unfriendly and not particularly charming, Cersei is in many ways the opposite of Tyrion, as well as in how valid her views on herself are. In reference to her beliefs as to who she is, Cersei believes herself to be the female counterpart of Tywin Lannister, her father (or not, if you subscribe to certain theories). After her father’s funeral, but I can’t really look this scene up right now, the reader knows this to be false, where Cersei was all wildfire

While Tyrion and Cersei are very interesting, a theory which I do subscribe to) is rather different. Jaime’s notions of who he is are a little bit blurred, likely because he changes quite a bit as the story progresses. We get the sense that, for the greater part of his life, Jaime did not give any serious thought to who he was, or anything of the like. Instead, he let others make those decisions for him. Tywin said he was to become a knight, and so he did. Jaime’s life is a long practice in obedience, but for a female knight who sticks to that path very devoutly, even though he had done good

Another very important character coupling to look at is the two bastards, but he’s important to mention because of Ramsay. Jon follows Tyrion’s advice, and remembers who he is. As a result, Jon is an effective character, at least in the eyes of the reader. Ramsay, on the other hand, is a stark (Haha, or who they want to see get their comeuppance

I read an essay awhile back that tried to defend some of the actions of the more despicable characters in ASOIAF, not a Snow. The author went on to say that being a Bolton meant, at least in historical terms, flaying people. Ramsay’s brutal treatment of other’s, then, is just him trying to fit in his the family he feels he is a part of, though the society of Westeros disagrees.

A recent post here expounded on that idea, Ramsay ranks higher than many on the social scale, but in all reality, he was still a bastard of a lord and a Miller’s wife, and therefore looked down upon by the rest of the Westerosi powerful. Theon, then, is the perfect person for Ramsay’s experiment. Heir to the Iron Islands, rather handsome and excessively arrogant, everyone that witnesses that will see and understand how Ramsay Snow could become Ramsay Bolton. In short, and they use that in order to effectively apply their talents.

I’ll give one final example of the opposite of that, about Daenerys Targaryen, a fan favorite of many. I loved Daenerys when I was first introduced to her, but as the books went on it got to the point where she gave me headaches. It was Quaithe who finally revealed (subtly, of course) why that was. It came at the end of the fifth book, when Dany is wandering in the Dothraki Sea. She heard Quaithe’s voice saying “Remember who you are, Daenerys. The dragons know. Do you?”

Suddenly, and never will be, the Queen of Meereen. I feel this might be George R.R. Martin’s way of telling us that just because you sit on a throne does not make you a leader of that land. In playing the Game of Thrones, this could be of extreme importance. As Dany was not the Queen of Meereen, she was unable to rule it effectively, and that’s why her character bumbled around so much. Previous to that, when she was with the Dothraki or in Quarth, and was therefore able to handle herself much more effectively.

I think I’ve spoken enough now, and if we ever succeed in that momentous effort as a subreddit, we may be able to predict the events of future books with greater accuracy, instead of reading about the latest unsupported theory, which will probably be that Howland Reed is secretly warging into every character, so he’s actually the only character we really ever know.

**Major points:**

- Almost every single thread is already ""spoilers all."" It's redundant to have ""(Spoilers all)"" at the beginning of every thread and the giant box of spoiler rules above the new thread box is annoying.
- There is major ""spoiler creep"" into threads with lesser scope because everyone is used to posting in threads with spoilers for all books. If the subreddit remains unspoiled
- This subreddit has a more restrictive spoiler policy for thread titles than /r/gameofthrones
- Allowing blatant spoilers in thread titles would be a major problem for anyone who happens to accidentally visit the subreddit or is already subscribed without having finished the books.
- Some people may want to have a serious discussion of the first couple books without the memes and ""it is known"" nonsense in /r/gameofthrones before they finish the series.

**The proposal:**

- Make (Spoilers ADWD) the default for this subreddit
- Allow people to *restrict* the scope of their posts by adding tags like (Spoilers ACOK) to their threads.
- Posts relating to TWOW must be tagged as such.
- Remind people that they should try to come up with clever ways to convey information to those who have finished the books in their titles while keeping out major spoilers.

1345335640.0,yg8md,(Spoiler All) A comparison of the plot progression of Dany and Jon.,Badenoch101,250,46,230,"So here in [/r/asoiaf](/r/asoiaf) we are no strangers to the myriad tinfoil theories on the series and one that had always seemed alittle baseless to me was the 'Jon and Dany will end up together' theory. However despite it being abit too much like a fairy tale ending I have come to notice certain comparisons between Dany and Jons story progression in the series which actually makes this outcome more believable in my eyes.
I'll list to make it quicker.

1) Both unexpectedly fall in love with a barbarian (Drogo/Ygritte) and even resist it at first. Both these relationships end tragically and are actually inadvertantly caused by Dany and Jon themselves. They both have guilt over this.

2) Both have been made to travel beyond Westeros in the series into harsh and cruel lands unknown to them. Furthermore both have survived it, Dany's merciful and empathetic actions to the slaves in Essos mirror Jons attitude to most of the wildlings looking for safety. In short they are of a similar mindset here.

3) Both have a complicated relationship to their ancient families (Stark/Targ). Neither are entirely a part of their familial lineage nor are they entirely seperate from it. They both bear burdens from their familial connections (Jons bastardry

4) Both Dany and Jon found themselves suddenly in positions of power (Nights watch commander/ Queen of Mereen). Both tried to use their position to affect positive change with disaterous results and betrayal.

5) A little less philosophical but still worth the mention as a link

6) The obvious link in Jon and Ghost and Dany and Drogon/Rheagal/Viserion.


Im sure there is more that I noticed on my last re-read that im forgetting. It seems to me that Dany and Jon's plot progression by this point is far too similar to be entirely a coincidence

1376403034.0,1ka0wc,[Spoilers All] A twist on a popular Patchface Theory,Salacious-,289,80,111,"I've seen the theory on here that Patchface's prophecies are a prediction from the Drowned God

My theory, here are some of his sayings (in no particular order) that refer to ""Under the sea.""

----

1\. ""Under the sea, I know, oh, oh, oh.""

The men of the Night's Watch from the Fist of the First Men are part of the wight army in the Land of Always Winter.

---

2\. ""We will march into the sea and out again. Under the waves we will ride seahorses, oh, oh.”

Into the sea and out again means that they will march against the Others into the Land of Always Winter. Seahorses are dragons, indicated by the next quote:

---

3\. ""Under the sea, they do.""

I think this is a reference to the Night's King

---

4\. ""Under the sea,” Patchface sang somewhere. “I know, I know, oh, oh, oh.""

Not too sure about this one. Some sort of sorcery in the Land of Always Winter?

5\. ""Under the sea

6\. ""Under the sea

1369641992.0,1f4m9y,(Spoilers All) Regarding Tyrion,DiggSuxNow,253,46,109,"So there's been a bit of talk recently about the differences in narration between different POVs

In that regard I don't necessarily believe it is true. Let's look at the way other characters perceive him:

* Sansa: This is the most obvious, allegiance and the fact that she had hope of escaping KL through the Tyrells. However, she does note in her POV that he is not a monster, and treats her far better than Joffrey would have (I know being better behaved than Joffrey is not setting the bar high, but it's something). She also indicates gratitude that he did not force her to consumate the marriage, especially after hearing about the RW. So Sansa isn't a big Tyrion fan, but she clearly doesn't see him as horrid (other than appearance).

* Catelyn: This one's unusual, not Jaime's honour. This seems a little contradictory, but perhaps suggests that Catelyn's actions when she arrests Tyrion were more based on her perceptions of Lannisters as a whole rather than Tyrion alone (that is, she could imagine Tywin, Jaime or Cersei killing Bran, therefore she doesn't question that Tyrion would). Despite her dislike of Tyrion because they're on other sides, it's hard to say whether she thinks him completely without honour.

* Other Starks: They have frosty relations with Tyrion, bastards and broken things"" line. 

Jon Snow also gets along with him when he travels to the wall. Ned would not have counted Tyrion amongst his friends

* Cersei and Tywin: Ok, but that is pretty much just a way of Tywin saying ""I don't like you, but you are fairly competent"". I mean, this is the guy who planned the RW, what does he define as ""low cunning"" as opposed to ""skilful diplomacy""?

So whilst they don't like Tyrion, so she was always going to perceive him as a monster. Tywin doesn't get a POV so it's hard to say, but like above with the ""Low cunning"" comment, he probably is biased so that he would see Tyrion doing something and think it sneaky, but he would have probably done a similar thing in the same circumstances and perceived it as brilliance. Tyrion is his son, after all. 


* Jaime: Jaime was said to treat Tyrion a lot kinder than Cersei or Tywin did. We don't see all that much interaction between the two, which implies that he enjoyed Tyrion's company. 

The only interaction we've actually seen between them is when Jaime rescues him

After all that went down that night (Tyrion telling him he was guilty, I'm sure Jaime's thoughts on Tyrion won't be as high, but they haven't had a scene together since (In fact, I hope that they do meet up again before the end of the books, either on the same or opposing sides).

* Other characters: There are no other POV characters I can think of which directly interact with Tyrion, really""). Varys tells Tyrion that there are many who knew that he saved KL during the Battle of the Blackwater (they wouldn't publicly acknowledge it, perhaps, but they knew). Hell, the Red Viper puts his life on the line to defend him (yes it was mainly to get at the Mountain, but I believe Oberon saw through the sham trial and knew that it was probably not Tyrion who actually killed Joffrey, and he also indicated he wouldn't have minded Tyrion coming and working with him and his brother in Dorne).

So in conclusion

- Sansa (didn't find him horrible)

- Jon Snow (liked him)

- Bran (Apprehensive

- Catelyn (Arrested him on a trumped up charge. Later seems to trust his word to an extent. Probably despises his family more than him per se)

- Cersei (Hates him

- Jaime (Liked him until the night he rescues him)

**tl;dr**: I believe Tyrion doesn't seem to be a monster through other POVs. Most of the characters who have negative opinions of him are because they either don't like any Lannisters as a whole, and his character is really no worse through others eyes than through his.

I know this could be nothing

Could it actually be Lady Stoneheart, but the show runners are both making Catelyn more regretful towards the way she behaved to Jon, and they're also establishing Melisandre's knowledge of the kiss of life.

So, somehow finds out about Jon's true parentage, and Melisandre asks her to pass on the kiss of life. If you think about it, it'd be kind of heart-breaking, she finally learns her kids are okay, she gets to understand Ned's motives, and she finally accepts Jon

EDIT: /u/Zecowsay also reminds about another thing Melisandre mentions:

Aside from the generally-accepted ones of R+L=J, here are my more well-thought out ones: 

1. [Littlefinger's entire endgame was designed to ""save"" Catelyn](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/xvqua/spoilers_and_speculation_all_petyr_baelish_is_a/). Now that she's dead

2. Benjen Stark is still alive (and is himself). He's being held hostage by the Others and they're planning to use him to get through that gate under the Nightfort that Bran, and Hodor go through. 

3. Bejen witnessed Lyanna's marriage to Rhaegar. It took place in Winterfell before they ran off. The reason Jon has to go into the Stark crypts is because [that's where Lyanna's Targaryen bridal cloak is hidden](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/10pt18/spoiler_allspeculation_whos_gonna_spill_the_beans/c6flxiy) (Credit for that theory goes to /u/angrybiologist). Benjen's guilt over what happened as a result of this (deaths of his brother, and many more in the ensuing war) is what prompted him to join the Night's Watch.

4. Queen Jeyne Stark is the more beautiful queen from Cersei's prophecy. Finding out that she's Maggy's great-granddaughter is what made me believe this one.

In the House of the Undying
&gt; He appears to look at Dany then,"" and ""The dragon has three heads.""

Dany thinks on this and often repeats it to herself. I don't think the statement is meant to be taken literally that there will be three dragonriders.  I think instead Rhaegar misinterprets that there needs to be three working against the Others.

**The Prince that was Promised**
Rhaegar in the same vision above believed that his son Aegon was the Prince that was promised saying:
&gt; ""He is the prince that was promised

However
&gt; ""What fools we were, but now one and now the other, as changeable as flame. The language misled us all for a thousand years.""

and
&gt; ""Daenerys is the one

Once Maester Aemon has the proper information he is easily able to figure out that Daenerys the Prince that was Promised. 

**Azor Ahai Reborn**
The first clue that lead me on this goose hunt was that Maester Aemon when speaking of Daenerys as the Prince that was Promised
&gt; ""The pages told of Azor Ahai. Lightbringer was his sword. Tempered with his wife’s blood if Votar can be belived. Thereafter Lightbringer was never cold to the touch, its eyes melted and dribbled down its cheeks, and its body burst into flame.""

Yet
&gt; ""It is the war for the dawn you speak of

Melisandre replies:
&gt; ""He stands before you ... though you lack the eyes to see. Stannis Baratheon is Azor Ahai come again, the red sword of heroes.""

Melisandre claims that Azor Ahai and the Prince that was Promised are the same person. But it has been established that Melisandre is not the most reliable interpreter (Renly smashing Stannis at KL
Melisandre may not be the best interpreter of visions or prophecy yet everything she has seen has come true in some way

&gt; ""I pray for a glimpse of Azor Ahai

Melisandre has found Azor Ahai in Jon Snow but her desire to be right about Stannis blinds her from realizing it.  Jon's actions lead directly to the death of Ygritte which is his Nissa Nissa. And his dream in ADWD is telling:
&gt; ""Burning shafts hissed upward,"" an eagle cried, as foemen scuttled up the ice like spiders. Jon was armored in black ice, but his blade burned red in his fist. As the dead men reached the top of the Wall he sent them down to die again. He slew a greybeard and a beardless boy, a giant, a gaunt man with filed teeth, a girl with thick red hair. Too late he recognized Ygritte. She was gone as quick as she’d appeared.""

Assuming R+L=J, Daemon II Blackfyre, and Daenerys has some as well). I believe Jon is seeing what his future holds. Jon's assassination will and subsequent resurrection will act as his rebirth into Azor Ahai. Quickly during the assassination Jon's wounds are smoking, Bowen Marsh is crying giving salt, and Ser Patrek's star is covered in blood thus the red star. 

**The Last Hero**
We receive the story of the Last Hero from Old Nan as she tells it to Bran Stark:
&gt; ""Now these were the days before the Andals came, who had taken those lands from the children of the forest. Yet here and there in the fastness of the woods, the children still lived in their wooden cities and hollow hills, and the faces in the trees kept watch. So as cold and death filled the earth, the last hero determined to seek out the children, in the hopes that their ancient magics could win back what the armies of men had lost. He set out into the dead lands with a sword, a horse, and his horse

Clearly only one person in the books fights this story and that is **Bran Stark as the Last Hero**.  He alone has sought out the Children of the Forest (with an assist from Bloodraven) and came with Summer (""his dog"") and companions Hodor
Bran has shown remarkable skinchanging skills and while he may skinchange into a dragon I don't think he has to to be considered one of the dragon's heads (just as I don't necessarily think Jon needs to ride a dragon to be one of the heads).
It is interesting that no where in the books does anyone compare the Last Hero to Azor Ahai or the Prince that was Promised even though the stories of the three are all remarkably similar.  

**TL;DR: By having one mythical person from the past return in three different ways I think the three heads of the dragon are fulfilled in Daenerys Targaryen (The Prince that was Promised)

I was disquieted to read about Tywin Lannister's supposed incompetence. Being an excellent schemer is important

**Top Tier - Those who are both successful and cunning**

1. Petyr Baelish, he rose from the son of an unimportant lord to the Master of Coin. He easily plays other pieces off each other. At the end of ADWD, he is incredibly well-situated.

2. Varys, Daenerys, and Aegon.

4. Roose Bolton

5. Daenerys Targaryen, she acquired an enormous army of fearsome warriors and freed tens of thousands of slaves while easily sacking three cities. Aside from being stranded in the Dothraki sea with naught but rags and loose stools, her prospects are outstanding.

6. Stannis Baratheon, though he has ably recovered thus far. Could argue for placement in the Second Tier.

7. Euron Greyjoy

**Second Tier - Those otherwise successful

1. Renly Baratheon,000 strong - almost certainly would have taken King’s Landing had he not been assassinated by Melisandre’s shadow demon. 

2. Doran Martell, but he is a patient, capable schemer whose three major plans look OK on paper but never quite work out. He might be able to save the Martell-Targaryen alliance and the Dornish people are unbloodied by the war.

3. Wyman Manderly, and Frey Pie.

4. Olenna Tyrell, and its grasp on the Throne is strong. We'll see how she handles the Ironborn.

**Third tier - Those with moderate success

1. Tywin Lannister

2. Tyrion Lannister, but he is a capable player and his prospects will improve if he can bring the Second Sons over to Daenerys' cause and become her Hand.

3. Jon Snow

4. Walder Frey, many many Freys have perished since the Red Wedding and his alliances are in peril thanks to Tywin Lannister’s death and Roose Bolton’s upcoming battle with King Stannis. He could belong in the second tier. Also, Frey Pie.

5. Asha Greyjoy

6. Robb Stark

**Fourth Tier - Those who have been met with little success or are just pieces**

1. Cersei Lannister, and orchestrating the premature death of Robert Baratheon. After that, however, she was headed off at every turn by Tywin, Tyrion, Petyr, or Varys. Her firstborn died, and by condemning Tyrion in her blind, refusing to pay the Crown’s debt to the Iron Bank, she is captured by the Faith and forced to take her walk of shame. She is now at the mercy of a trial by combat

2. Eddard Stark, kicked off a war and the eventual ruin of his house. Even more brittle than Stannis Baratheon.

3. Theon Greyjoy

4. Catelyn Stark

5. Sansa Stark, she has never made a move on her own accord other than to reveal her father's plans to Cersei Lannister.

6. Janos Slynt

7. Robert Baratheon

8. Lysa Arryn

9. Viserys Targaryen

10. Balon Greyjoy

11. Arianne Martell

**Notable Omissions**

* Jaime Lannister and Arya Stark - They are more characters undergoing a transformation rather than contenders in the Game of Thrones.

* Sam Tarly - He did get Jon elected

* Bran Stark - He might later become a player

* Victarion Greyjoy - He is arguably a piece under Euron's power

* Aegon - It's too early to tell

Robb is also described as pretty much ignoring Rickon for the most part

If I remember right it is also shown that Rickon doesn't really listen to Luwin at all

Reading the series we also see how their direwolves reflect the personality of their owner and shaggydog is described as feral &amp; untamed even attacking Luwin.

I can't remember if it was ADWD or AFFC but there it was revealed that Rickon was on Skagos, he is now about 8 (Edit: 5 years, I counted wrong) years old being raised under this conditions.

However, commanding her plea for help to be thrown into the fire. He is consumed with bitter thoughts about the ""Queen of Whores"" and it seems like the sort of bitterness that will continue to grow and gnaw at him.

Cersei, she might feel different, but she doesn't!

 Here's the small detail: long before enough time has passed for Cersei to guess that Jaime has ignored her, and so she'll have a very different view of what happened than reality.

To summarize:
Cersei's opinion before sending the letter: The love of her life
Reality: Jaime burns her letter and disappears with Brienne.
Cersei's opinion after hearing of Jaime's disappearance: The love of her life

Here's where it gets a bit speculative, and thus will be overcome with positive emotions if she ever sees Jaime again.

On the other hand, and the BWB, I think we can all agree he will not do so unscathed. He'll be coming out of that with all sorts of emotional trauma. Now, remember his ""Queen of Whores"" mentality at the outset of his travels with Brienne. It is my belief that this hatred of his sister will continue to fester throughout his coming experiences, definitely spurred on by the fact that Cersei can share some blame for his current predicament. If he does survive and makes his way towards Cersei again, I think it will be with a heart full of rage and a burning enmity for his twin.

So the scene is: An extremely desperate Cersei finally sees her white knight, and knows she is saved and loved and that all is right in the world. A bitter and traumatized Jaime finally sees the ""Queen of Whores"" and target of his hatred, and knows that he has to kill her.

Furthermore, the faith of R'hollor. The practitioners of R'hollor are primarily from the lower classes of Westeros and literally worship the fire. I imagine they would welcome a liberator on dragon back, and that Dany could incite the unwashed masses to revolt.

That being said, especially including those deaths she had an indirect or assisting role in (like the whispers and the weasel soup). She goes from killing a stableboy in the heat of the moment to coldly tricking a guard to bend over so she can slit his throat, as well as having Jaqen H'ghar murder Weese just because he was abusive to her, in a terrifyingly short period of time. What ordinary ten-year-old girl would, upon learning that she had a private assassin, have him kill her boss in the kitchen because he occasionally hit her and wouldn't share his goddamn capon?!?

Then there's the prayers. I find it quite disturbing that she, but whose deaths she actively works towards and who she is willing to murder at any opportunity. Honestly, some of them haven't done anything especially bad, like Dunsen and Polliver, whose only real crimes were being part of Gregor Clegane's band.

And then there's the tavern scene. Just... the *stabbing*... and repeating the questions, finishing off that squire, just like that. It's chilling.

Melisandre definitely has powers. There is no question about that.

Furthermore, and no other Red Preist is ever seen or heard to mention that Stannis is believed to be Azor Ahai. This implies that, if Stannis is Azor Ahai reborn, then Melisandre knows something that no other Red Preist in the world has seen or acted upon.

That being said, but is just wrong about it. The above can all be used as evidence that she's just pretending to believe it; however, her POV chapter appears to show an honest devotion to Stannis. As with so many other predictions, she's somehow just misinterpreted it; however, as we've seen with her other misinterpretations, she never admits that she might be wrong until after it has been proven.

1368388229.0,1e76oo,(Spoilers all)An accidental death.,NoOneILie,256,64,110,"It is a commonly held belief that the Queen of Thorns with the help of Littlefinger murdered Joffrey at his own wedding using Sansa’s hairnet and a dose of strangler.  I think this is a remarkably clever red herring by GRRM.   Let me first state my reasons for why I think it would be foolish for the QoT or Littlefinger to want to kill Joffrey.   
  
1st)  There is no guarantee the Lannisters would marry Margaery to Tommen.  With Joffrey gone the Tyrell claim to the throne is non-existent.  You would think they would have at least waited until Marge was with child.  
  
2nd) Littlefinger’s entire powerbase comes from brokering the Tyrell/Lannister alliance.  If it falls apart he falls out of favor.  
  
So with that being said
  
Let’s begin with a few choice excerpts from Tyrion (chapter 60).   
  
&gt;  my lady
  
&gt; Sansa looked at her uncertainly. ""The queen has chosen all the servers.""    

Which queen though?  It is implied Cersei but could it be the Queen of Thorns or even Margaery?  
  
Now let’s take a look at the finale so to speak.  
 
&gt; 	**A serving man placed a slice of hot pigeon pie in front of Tyrion and covered it with a spoon of lemon cream.** The pigeons were well and truly cooked in this pie,"" Tyrion said. ""You need a breath of cool air, and I need a fresh doublet."" He stood and offered her his hand. ""Come.""

&gt; But before they could make their retreat, remember?""

&gt; ""I need to change into fresh garb

&gt; ""No. I like the look of you this way. Serve me my wine.""  



&gt; The king's chalice was on the table where he'd left it. Tyrion had to climb back onto his chair to reach it. Joff yanked it from his hands and drank long and deep, ""we should return to our places. Lord Buckler wants to toast us.""
  
Here is where we all assume the poisoning happens.  Tyrion left the cup on the table
    
&gt;  There was only half a swallow of wine remaining when she offered it back to him.  “And now you.”  
...  
&gt; He let the empty cup drop from his fingers to shatter on the floor.  ""He does have power here, the the ruby shimmered redly.  
  
&gt;  **Cressen tried to reply
    
So mere moments after swallowing the strangler poison Cressen cannot even breathe let alone speak.  After downing *an entire goblet of wine* though something more happens to Joffrey.  

&gt; ""My uncle hasn't eaten his pigeon pie."" Holding the chalice one-handed, it's good.""** Spitting out flakes of crust, he coughed and helped himself to another fistful. ""Dry, though. Needs washing down."" Joff took a swallow of wine and coughed again, more violently.  
  

Joffrey coughs first from the pie and then finishes his wine....  
  
  
&gt;  ""I want to see, kof kof, pig, Uncle. I want . . . "" His words broke up in a fit of coughing.

&gt; Margaery looked at him with concern. ""Your Grace?""

&gt;  ""It's, noth - kof, pie."" Joff took another drink, or tried to, but all the wine came spewing back out when another spate of coughing doubled him over. His face was turning red. ""I, kof, I can't
  

Could it be that it wasn't the wine that was poisoned at all
  
The Queen of Thorns wanted Tyrion dead because of his marriage to Sansa.  With Tyrion out of the picture there would be no one to stop them from spiriting Sansa off to marry Willas.  
  
Or in a cruel twist of fate Cersei
  
&gt; ""He's choking

&gt; Her grandmother moved to her side. ""Help the poor boy!"" the Queen of Thorns screeched
    
And Joffrey dies, for treating Sansa like an object.  He dies because he couldn't help but mock and degrade his uncle Tyrion.  
  
tl;dr  -  Joffrey was poisoned by the pie not the wine and it is likely Cersei is the one who did it or perhaps it was the Queen of Thorns and Littlefinger",self,t5_2r2o9,1368404718.0,,Stark,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1e76oo/spoilers_allan_accidental_death/

This is his first full-fledged endorsement of someone for the throne, and seems to add more credence to Aegon being the 'mummer's dragon' and a Blackfyre pretender.

**TL;DR Varys is the Mummer mentioned in Dany's prophesy making Aegon the Mummer's Dragon who Dany must be wary of**

1334674330.0,se99r,(Spoilers thru AFFC) Tywin's Involvement in a Conspiracy...,corduroyblack,245,50,100,"**You're not paranoid if they really are out to get you.**

Tyrion has the odds stacked against him from the opening of ACOK to his departure from KL at the end of ASOS. Several events have led me to believe the following thesis points:

1) Tywin intended for Tyrion to die in King's Landing.

2) Tywin first intended for Tyrion to die at Blackwater.

3) Tywin eventually came to realize that Joffrey would be a terrible King.

4) Tywin used Tyrion as a scapegoat

5) Tywin's plan was foiled/interrupted by a singular event: Jamie's refusal to leave the Kingsguard. Jamie's reaction to his father's ensuing rebuke

**Evidence**

- The previous four Hands of the King all died. Tywin was abundantly aware of this fact.

- Ser Mandon Moore was specifically assigned to accompany Tyrion during the battle. Obviously

- Tyrion's attempts to investigate Moore's attack were stymied and eventually dropped

- In ASOS, nor his capacity to be led around by the nose and told what to do. Bronn had implied this in ACOK. In totality, Tywin had to have seen that Joffrey would have never become a successful King. His invocation of Tywin's ""fear of Aerys"" was particularly egregious.

- It has long been discussed that Tyrion may have been Aerys's lovechild with Joanna Lannister, there is the possibility that this is true. Tyrion's dragon dreams, Tywin's hatred of Tyrion (which obviously has other explanations as well), Tywin's dying declaration (you are no son of mine), Tywin's refusal to grant Casterly Rock to his only remaining heir not already pledged to a life of non-Lordship... 

- Tywin is in a spectacularly complex and troubling situation. He needs an heir to Casterly Rock. He doesn't want to use Tyrion, the initial response is ""of course he doesn't. Tyrion is his son."" That being said, Tywin has put Tyrion in a position of extreme danger before, for little potential gain. Why was Tyrion sent into battle in AGOT? Why was he ordered to King's Landing as Hand? Why was he married to the one person who could essentially incite half a continent to want to murder him?

Thus

In conclusion, the Queen of Thorns (or another Tyrell, perhaps Margaery) would not have been so bold without the say-so of the Hand of the King. Further, there is no evidence that Tywin had the same enmity towards Highgarden that Cersei displayed later in AFFC. If Tywin had lived, it is doubtful that the same problems would have arisen. Tommen would have married Margaery and the Tyrells and Lannisters would have cemented their alliance further. Only Tywin's death and Cersei's stupidity ruined this strong alliance.

Obviously, if you choose.

**TL;DR** Tywin may have allowed Joffrey's death in a conspiracy with Highgarden to also rid himself of Tyrion.

1371843848.0,1gtbbs,(Spoilers All) The Future of House Frey,DanLiberta,223,28,111,"Since the Red Wedding

Now, as Wyman Manderly has reminded us, The North Remembers, and they too will seek a bloody path of vengeance against House Frey. However, the fact is that there are so many Freys means that it's rather unlikely for them all to be baked into pies and slain by outlaws. Such a practice would just take too long. Instead, the main and most likely way for the Freys to get karma'd is a large sort of extinction event, but who would cause such a thing? The Freys themselves.

It's been foreshadowed throughout the books that, many of Lord Walder's descendents name their offspring in his honor to seek his favor, and the tensions among his brood seek to tear the House apart. In AFFC, Cersei comments that Lord Walder's successor would be more than willing to trot out some undesirable relatives. And as Merret Frey states in his epilogue:

&gt; He [Lord Frey] could not possibly last much longer, and not for the better*

[Galanix's Guide to Westerosi Succession] (http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/16mqp1/spoilers_all_complete_guide_to_westerosi/)

The above link has the complete listing of House Frey's line of succession. It's very long. Rather than analyzing each one

### **Edwyn Frey and Black Walder**

It is impossible to discuss one brother in this context without the other. Edwyn is the current heir, Lord Walder's eldest son, by way of Stevron's eldest son via Stevron's first wife, Ryman Frey. Ryman was slain by the BWB on his way back to the Twins. Ryman had three sons, Edwyn (who married Janyce Hunter), Black Walder, and finally Petyr ""Pimple"" Frey (deceased

These two are at the top of the line of succession, cold, and easily angered. Generally not nice guys. But as much as they're like to toss out half the House when they takeover, they hate each other even more (as stated by Merrett Frey). When their father, Ser Ryman, died, Edwyn immediately thought to blame Black Walder, this cold feud will turn hot.

Now, Gatehouse Ami, Lord Walder's 7th wife, and most importantly, the wives of both his brothers. This casts paternity doubts on several Freys, most importantly Edwyn's young daughter. Combine this with Big Walder and Little Walder placing Black Walder as fourth, and later third in line when (at those times), and it could very well be that Walda is another bastard and Edwyn has no legitimate offspring, one of these two will die. And once that is over with, or Jared Frey's offspring

### **Emmon Frey**

Emmon is the second son of Lord Walder, but things may get a bit quirky with the line of succession in the Frey civil war. However, as the Lord of Riverrun (though not Lord Paramount of the Riverlands) Emmon still stands at a fairly good position regardless of whether he inherits the Twins. It is unlikely that he and his offspring will attempt to seize the Twins.

However, can call on a reliable bit of Lannister support, and Emmon does not seem to be a man who has any feuds with his family (though who knows if Genna would truly allow any Freys in). Despite this though, the fact that Emmon and his children are essentially 'in the way' of the line advancing could cause a conflict for any major players for the seat later down the line, especially if other Freys who are 'in the way' flee to Riverrun, but ultimately it presents an obstacle.

Or at least it would if Emmon Frey had any sort of expected lifespan. He has replaced the Tully's as the owner of Riverrun. And there is a Tully running around, because Genna's pretty awesome. But that's a prominent Frey removed from the equation (even if some of his children are elsewhere). Moreso if Lady Stoneheart waits until after the Freys collapse and some go to Riverrun (if that happens).

### **Offspring of Amarei Crakehall

None of these are likely to make any major plays, it is worthwhile to detail where they stand.

Hosteen Frey is the eldest of this brood, and may also be a home for fleeing Freys, but it is hard to tell. If Lady Stoneheart is able to infiltrate Darry as she has Riverrun, she cross many Freys off her list, but the ravaged lands of Darry could be facing winter related problems instead. Others, like with many Freys, are scattered across Westeros (and some in Essos) as squires, septons

### **Lame Lothar Frey**

Aaaaaand we're back to a major player. Lothar Frey is the Steward of the Twins, born to Alyssa Blackwood. Despite being son number 12, keep in mind that sons 1, 3, 4, 7, 9, son 2 seems to be doomed to die at Riverrun, House Frey would have to increase GRRM's body count by half for Lothar to take the title of Lord of the Crossing by lineage

Luckily for Lothar, and well spoken, and is clearly trusted and liked enough by Lord Walder to have been made steward, to have been allowed to lead the negotiations with Robb at Riverrun regarding Edmure's wedding, and planning most of the details of the Red Wedding with Lord Roose Bolton (it being Lothar's idea to use the song ""The Rains of Castamere"" as the signal). Merrett Frey describes him as being particularly dangerous, and judging by his character, it's in a wholeheartedly different manner of dangerous than Black Walder.

### **The Rest Of Them**

Most of the rest of the Freys are rather decent people, who is at Winterfell and may also fall victim to Stannis Justice. Lothar's full blooded siblings are minor. Lord Walder's living children off his next wife, Bethany Rosby, are Perwyn Frey (who held serious Stark sympathies), a maester at Longbow Hall, Olyvar Frey (Robb's squire), and Roslin, I think it'd be funny for Edmure and Roslin to wind up as heirs, but it's hard to tell

The only other Frey of note isn't technically a Frey, he is behind all other trueborn descendents of Lord Walder. And there's a lot of them. However, Bastard Walder is of note because, despite his low ranking in inheritance, he is regarded as rather competent and a ferocious fighter. His reputation as a warrior has earned him several responsibilities among the house, and odds are he will not be a player for the seat but instead may wind up as an ally of somebody who is. Wedding his daughter to a male heir is the closest he'll get. He fiercely defends Edwyn in the feud at Riverrun between the Freys and the other lords, though this could be him defending the family (as well as a likely heir to the Twins) more than particular loyalty to Edwyn. He is also found with Lothar on two occasions, this could simply be Bastard Walder obeying orders rather than an allegiance to Lothar

### **The Verdict**

Ultimately, Black Walder, and Lothar. The rest have either not been made major characters, or are holed up in Darry. Edwyn has the advantage of being the next in line, and when Lord Walder dies will be able to immediately remove his rivals (or as stated at the beginning, name them the architects of the Red Wedding and have them killed or Walled). However, this also puts a major target on his back, in turn, however his reputation puts a target on his back. Lothar, and his position as architect of the Red Wedding will be justification for his slaughter.

These are their strategies: 

Edwyn merely needs to survive until Lord Walder dies, or any other rivals or inconvenient relatives he believes he has.

Black Walder needs to get rid of Edwyn before Lord Walder dies, after which he can toss out or turn in any inconvenient or unwanted relations.

Lothar has a trickier path. He needs to survive the first battle between Edwyn and Black Walder without being tossed out or hung, and then wed one of his four daughters to that Frey. I also put my money on Lothar being the one who wins over Bastard Walder in the end due to Lothar being far more intelligent than his grand nephews.

Ultimately, he may very well lose them if the North marches South again, but frankly, I'm putting my bet on Black Walder besting Edwyn, but Lothar sweeping in on Black Walder.

You want the Freys to face justice? Well here it is. The Freys that took part in the Red Wedding are either in Riverrun, where those still not baked into pies face the wrath of Stannis; and the rest will be casualties in the threeway war between Lothar, Edwyn, and Black Walder. Or, worse, they'll be forced out from the Twins into the hands of the BWB to the South or the Reeds in the North. This will leave a very very weak House Frey standing if/when Stannis marches south after taking back the north.

My takeaway from Dany in the show's version of Qarth is:

* She'll learn very directly to trust no one. Qarth itself came across as salvation
* She'll learn how perilous her position really is. She knows from this season already from the death of her blood rider at the hand of a khalasar, the survivors of the lamb people and her own khalasar, and theoretically… Illyrio.

* Daenerys Targaryen (Queen of Meereen and of the Dragons)
* Sansa Stark (Queen in the North)

The second prophecy however

&gt;Cersei: ""Will the king and I have children?""
&gt;Maggy: ""Oh, and when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.""	

I'm a firm subscriber to the opinion that the *valonqar* isn't a Baratheon or a Lannister. Tyrion is too far away, or at least Jaime kills himself out of grief. Note how Maggy doesn't say ""**your** *valonqar*"" - she just mentions a younger brother.

Let's review a list of male youngest brothers from houses she has made enemies of:

* Rickon Stark
* Stannis Baratheon
* Osney Kettleblack
* Aegon Targaryen/Blackfyre
* Theon Greyjoy
* Edmure Tully
* Sandor Clegane

However, and for him to realise his power and really make Cersei suffer for it. He won't physically choke her to death - he'll do it through sadistic abuse of power.

After-note: I'm seeing a lot of parallels between Tommen and the Roman emperor Nero. Nero was a quiet, chiefly his tutors and his mother. His mother was an incestuous she-beast bent on ruling the realm in all but name, and manipulated Nero by sleeping with him. 
Suddenly, severing his mother from all power in the process. Distraught at this loss, she soon began pushing for her stepson to become Emperor. Nero responded by moving her away and torturing her, eventually sending guards to stab her to death.

1370806353.0,1fzw7w,(Spoilers ALL) The Rue of Roose Bolton,Oberst_Azrael,224,33,84,"*""Don't make me rue the day I raped your mother.""*

Initially, the miller's wife did not tell Ramsay that his father, the Lord of the Dreadfort, hanged her husband and raped her to conceive him because she feared repercussion. It is known for having a ""quiet land, a quiet people."" Roose also demanded that she never tell Ramsay who his father is, so it stands to reason up to this point that Ramsay does not know the circumstances of his conception. 

We know the Ramsay does not take accepting his bastardy well. Anyone who presumes to call him ""Snow"" or even worse call him a bastard will most likely be at the business end of his flaying knife. We also know that Ramsay possess many of the same psychopathic tendencies as his father without the leechings to clear out the ""bad blood."" One of his favorite sports is hunting whores, sexual and sadistic objects for his amusement.

Suddenly, being the bastard of rape leaves him with nothing. And with Fat Walda preparing to give Roose a proper son (as opposed to Domeric who was likely poisoned by Ramsay), Ramsay's world is shattered.

We have seen the downfall of many families in ASoIaF. Some like the Starks were destroyed because of their attachment, she turned Rickard Karstark against Robb and forced his hand to execute him. In turn, this drove Robb back into the clutches of the Freys where he was murdered. 

Other families such as the Lannisters have been destroyed by the animosity between each other. Yes, as Walder Frey will likely die of old age in the next book, leaving his many children to fight among themselves for the Lordship of Riverrun. 

Where do the Boltons fall then? Given the last conversation between Roose and Ramsay, but it was damn effective in the short-term at subduing the Northmen. Likewise sending the Freys and the Manderlys out into the blizzard to engage Stannis might seem foolhardy but it empties space in Winterfell. Dead men don't eat up the winter stores. 

However one great hole in his plan is Ramsay. In contrast to Roose's subtle cunning and intrigue

The downfall of Bolton then will be when Ramsay decides its no longer prudent to keep his father alive. Revealing the truth of Ramsay's birth only shows how little regard Roose has for his son and Ramsay won't forget that. His shame of being a bastard will compound with being the product of rape, then dispose of Fat Walda so that he alone rules in the North. Of course then it is only a matter of time until the North comes for Ramsay.

**TL;DR**: Ramsay will be responsible for Roose's demise because he now knows the truth of his conception and Fat Walda is prepared to give Roose a proper heir.",self,t5_2r2o9,1370806601.0,,DayneOfStarfall,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1fzw7w/spoilers_all_the_rue_of_roose_bolton/

1348546104.0,10fll7,[Spoilers All] Two Reeks and the Ghost in Winterfell,GANGBANGARANG,223,30,145,"I've read theories of Theon being the Ghost in Winterfell. Other threads have compelling evidence on the matter: the spearwives' denial of the murders

**TIMELINE:** Reek 2, aka Theon, appears in ADWD and returns to Winterfell with Ramsay and Roose.

In ACOK, the men he went hunting with start showing up dead.

&gt;Outside his door, even to the privy. Winterfell wanted him dead. The very night they had returned from Acorn Water, Gelmarr the Grim had tumbled down some steps and broken his back. The next day, Aggar turned up with his throat slit ear to ear. Gynir Rednose became so wary that he shunned wine, took to sleeping in byrnie, coif, and helm, one morning the castle woke to the sound of the little dog barking wildly. They found the pup racing around the well

&gt;He could not let the killings go unpunished. Farlen was as likely a suspect as any, and condemned him to death. Even that went sour. As he knelt to the block, the kennelmaster said, “M’lord Eddard always did his own killings.” Theon had to take the axe himself or look a weakling. His hands were sweating, so the shaft twisted in his grip as he swung and the first blow landed between Farlen’s shoulders. It took three more cuts to hack through all that bone and muscle and sever the head from the body, and afterward he was sick, remembering all the times they’d sat over a cup of mead talking of hounds and hunting. ***I had no choice***, they had to die

I didn't realize this until today: he had his men killed so they would not speak. Wex was spared, mute, but the others couldn't keep secrets and Farlen was the scapegoat. But who did the killing?

&gt;“Gone

&gt;Theon had not heard him approach, he reflected***, but the notion made him nervous. Unlikely as it seemed, Reek could read and write, and he was possessed of enough base cunning to have hidden an account of what they’d done.

Quite interesting. 'Twas Reek 2's hand that held the blade

Skip ahead to ADWD. Men are turning up dead in Winterfell. 

&gt;The next morning Ser Aenys Frey’s grizzled squire was found naked and dead of exposure in the
old castle lichyard
put it forth that the man had drunk too much and gotten lost in the storm
why he had taken off his clothes to go outside. *Another drunkard*
host of suspicions.**

(the first 'accident' was a drunkard as well)

Reek 3 is suspected

&gt;Farther on
behind him. When they found themselves face-to-face their eyes met briefly. The man put a hand on his
dagger. “Theon Turncloak. Theon Kinslayer.”

&gt;“I’m not. I never … I was ironborn.”

&gt;“False is all you were. How is it you still breathe?”

&gt;“The gods are not done with me, the
night walker who had stuffed Yellow Dick’s cock into his mouth and pushed Roger Ryswell’s groom off
the battlements. Oddly
done with me.”

&gt;The man looked

Very odd. Few men recognize him at first, and the figure lets him go.

Two paragraphs later:

&gt;He was trapped here
he had made himself, Aggar, Gelmarr the Grim, the miller’s wife
from Acorn Water and her two young sons
they are angry. He thought of the crypts and those missing swords.

Gynir, a squire of Aenys Frey, both drunkards, a crossbowman of the Flints, all three suspected accidents, and Little Walder) but that may not bear fruit. All in all, I think the evidence is quite compelling.

Lastly: The chapter is called ""A Ghost in Winterfell"". He skips from breakfast to lunch:

&gt;As the garrison broke its fast that morning on stale bread fried in bacon grease (the lords and
knights ate the bacon)
“Stannis has friends inside the castle
man
cold
served—blood sausage

The spearwives admit to killing Yellow Dick but deny a role in Little Walder's death. Theon thinks they've done the other murders as well but there's no confession to that from them which leaves the question open.

1343920220.0,xkdma,(Spoilers ALL) The most pivotal chapter in the series?,redmond24,240,50,331,"I'm wondering what you all think is the most pivotal chapter in the series. 
For me it is the in ASOS when Tyrion kills Tywin. So much happens in this chapter: we find Shae in Tywin's bed. Did Tywin give Shae to Tyrion (through Bronn) to keep an eye on his son?

We find Tywin on the toilet with a really bad case. Did Oberyn poison him over diner? He always said he wanted revenge not only on the Mountain
Would Tyrion had killed Tywin if he gave him Casterly Rock? He should have just given him his birthright...

Did Varys knowingly set Tyrion loose on Tywin knowing Tyrion would kill him? His killing Kevan certainly makes it seem that way. To sew chaos in King's Landing. 

But nothing confuses me more than the interaction between Jaime and Tyrion. Why did Tyrion lie about killing Joffrey? But in this same sequence Tyrion tells Jaime about Cersei and Lancel. Jaime was always faithful to Cersei but she wasn't faithful. This sets in motion Jaime's heroics with Brienne I suppose.

They say Robb Stark won every battle but lost the war. This chapter really shows that the Lannisters won the war but lost the realm.

Fellow Crows:

After consulting with the community we maesters have decided to implement the following policy effective immediately: from now on any sexist or misogynistic post **or** comment directed at any of the female characters in the ASOIAF universe will be removed. Violators of this new rule shall receive one and **only one** warning before being banned. Please note that due to our close working relationship with the moderators at /r/gameofthrones anyone banned here will likely be banned there as well.

Before anyone thinks otherwise let me be clear: **this rule only applies to the fictional characters of the ASOIAF series**. Sexist and/or misogynistic comments aimed at other crows (i.e. redditors) are obviously still acceptable. Unlike the characters Catelyn, the moderators, to do it for them.

A sexist and/or misogynistic comment shall be defined as follows:

&gt;Any post or comment that demeans, or otherwise insults or belittles any female character in the ASOIAF series of novels and the television show, novellas, or any other medium based in the world of Westeros.

In order to help us maesters more easily enforce this new policy we have compiled a short list of adjectives and obscenities that

* annoying

* attractive

* bitch

* childish

* evil

* hot

* idiot

* incompetent

* mean

* moron

* prostitute

* sexy

* stupid

* ugly

* whiny

* whore

This list is **not** all encompassing and is meant only to give a general framework for what is unacceptable. We maesters retain the right to remove any post or comment that violates the spirit of this new rule at our sole discretion.

I think that we can all agree that there is no place for any form of sexism or misogyny on the Wall. The insults directed toward characters such as Cersei, too.

We maesters thank you in advance for your compliance with this new policy and appreciate the Rangers who utilize the report button to notify us of any violators.

1371048742.0,1g755z,(Spoilers All) A Theory on Nagga,BastardOfNightsong,232,43,47,"The story of the Sea Dragon Nagga is one of my favourite legends in ASOIAF.  However

[Nagas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nāga) appear in many Asian legends. They are generally indifferent snakes or dragons that protect nature. The Nagga that appears in the books has been slain and only it's bones remain.

&gt; Ahead loomed the sacred shore of Old Wyk and the grassy hill above it

*****

&gt; On the crown of the hill four-and-forty monstrous stone ribs rose from the earth like the trunks of great pale trees.

*****

&gt; From here he ruled both stone and salt

Pale trunks of trees are weirwood trunks. They have turned to stone like the weirwood in the castle Raventree of House Blackwood.

&gt; ""For a thousand years it has not shown a leaf. In another thousand it will have turned to stone

We have other mentions of groves of weirwoods on hills.

After Bran climbs the hill to reach the cave of COTF he notes

&gt; The world was black soil and white wood. The heart tree at Winterfell had roots as thick around as a giant's legs

Arya on the hill named High Heart

&gt; The next day they rode to a place called High Heart, some so wide that she could have used them for a bed.

Tom and the Ghost point out that magic still lingers here. Victarion felt the magic of Nagga when he arrives. Admittedly it could just be religious fervour.

There are members of House Stonetree on the island. It also provides an interesting parallel to Bloodraven. Nagga was trees becoming a dragon while Bloodraven was a dragon who became trees.

The COTF lived near weirwood groves. They called down the hammer of the waters in an attempt to shatter the neck to stop the invasion of First Men from the Children's Tower at Moat Cailin. Nagga supposedly drowned whole islands in wrath. We know that COTF shattered the Arm of Dorne by drowning it. This hammer of waters  was called down from the hill that later became Nagga. The COTF connection ties in with the mythical Naggas of Asia that protect nature. The COTF went to war to stop the deforestation committed by FM.

The slaying of Nagga by the Grey King represents the triumph of the First Men over the COTF that lived in the grove. In time

*****
I am fairly confident of the theory above. This is a continuation of the theory of Nagga being a COTF colony in a grove. Of course a lot of it is speculation without proof. So it could be considered crackpot.

*****

Black Harren is one of my favourite Kings of the past. He built Harrenhal. However Ironborn seldom build so far from the sea. The location of Harrenhal is extremely strange as it sits on the banks of God's Eye. The castle itself is a monstrous folly that took fourty long years to build. History tells us that Harren was an arrogant man. But

Harren visited Nagga and realized that the bones are just stone weirwoods. Harren's grandfather had conquered Raventree hall already and Harren made the connection. Perhaps he slept there and had prophetic dreams like Jaime and The Ghost of High Heart about something that lead him to construct Harrenhal. He adopted the Faith of Old Gods. Why else would a Drowned God worshipper have a weirwood in his castle? He however kept the thrall and saltwife  aspects of his Ironborn  culture and continued raiding the nearby kingdoms. The Isle of Faces is an island in the God's Eye lake. Here the pact of friendship was signed between the first men and COTF. There is a grove of living weirwood trees protected by Green Men. As Howland Reed has visited them

Perhaps it could even be with the help of Green Men. Cat says that Harren cut down weirwoods for beams. There are many followers of First Men who use weirwood trees to create tools. Ygritte has weirwood bow. Bloodraven had a similar bow. A man possibly Brandon Snow in Bran's vision was making weirwood arrows. A raider had a weirwood spear. So using weirwood materials is not immoral. Weirwood beams were used in construction of Harrenhal.

The vision of Harren could be  a vision of an invasion. Harren must have interpretated as an Others' invasion when it was in fact a vision of Aegon invading. His brother was packed off to the NW and the brother kept his vows even when Harren died.  Harren was also extremely arrogant when dealing with Aegon. He proclaimed that [stone does not burn](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/6592/) Such arrogance in face of 8000 men and Balerion seems like a folly. Perhaps he believed that the Green Men would protect him as he had a destiny to fight the invasion of Others. Of course they didn't and Harren burnt. Aegon wrote the history we read about. He  promptly demonized Argilac as the Arrogant and showed himself as a good guy. Perhaps he never knew about Harren's plans or he simply ignored them. Harren was Ironborn and hence unpopular in Riverlands. The smallfolk quickly picked up the tale.

1368136973.0,1e12ib,(Spoiler All) Speculation for Season 4: the show could be catching up with GRRM faster than you think,DirtyMerlin,242,53,196,"Let me preface this by saying that I would like to see the show go for 10 seasons. However, and while us here in r/ASOIAF may watch to whatever end

We already know that seasons 3 and 4 correspond roughly to the first and second halves of ASOS. This season will end with the Red Wedding in episode 9 (“The Rains of Castamere”) and Dany’s conquest of Yunkai in ep. 10 (“Mhysa”). This puts us at around the 2/3rds mark the ASOS. Season 4 will be a barnburner, the battle at the Wall and Stannis the Mannis saving the day, Jon becoming LC, the conquest of Meereen, Sansa’s escape and arrival in the Vale and Lysa’s flight out the Moon Door, the Red Viper v. the Mountain, and Tyrion’s escape and killing spree. The first appearance of Lady Stoneheart will be the cliffhanger for one of these two seasons, based on the ep. 10 title

Even all this isn’t enough to fill an entire season, where a combined AFFC/ADWD timeline will finally appear in full. I have some thoughts as to what the show might do in regards to including book material past ASOS. I'll list them in short here and put the long text in the comments to facilitate easier commenting on specific elements:

1) Bran and Arya pushing on ahead 

2) Theon's around

3) The Kingsmoot 

4) Intro to Dorne/Copious T&amp;A 

The Dorne addition might be a little more of a stretch, Arya and Bran will push ahead into AFFC/ADWD by the end of season 4. If Theon’s story was going to go at the same pace, they wouldn’t have shown him for these two seasons. Arya and Bran just got unlucky with how their chapters were stacked in the book, but I just don’t think there’s any way that they each spend yet another year trudging through the woods. It’s simply a question of what works better for the new format based off where they divided ASOS. 

If some or all of these changes are made, and I think Dan and D.B. would be wise to speed those parts up by placing them right before the season 4/5 break. Sam takes an entire book to get to Oldtown, Vic and Tyrion take more than that to get to Meereen, Brienne goes nowhere in particular. Many of the character arcs work better over one season as well: Brienne would have more than enough time to follow a few dead ends, meet the BWB and UnCat, and find Jaime in ten episodes; Jon Connington and Aegon don’t need more than a season to be introduced and get to Westeros; and basically everything after Tyrion leaves the Golden Company can be cut and changed to “largely uneventful traveling to Meereen"" (I highly doubt pig jousting will come into play). Cersei’s growing madness and downfall would be more effective and Jon’s tenure as LC and his subsequent betrayal would be more shocking in just one season as well. As for most of the new POVs introduced post-ASOS, I think we have to give them less weight that the ones around from the beginning. Aeron is unlikely to have a significant contribution to the show and Areo or Arys are unlikely to be anything more than side characters. Most of the newer ones were introduced to observe anyway

My big concern with a one season-AFFC/ADWD is less that much will be excised and more that there is a lot of content in the forthcoming TWOW that probably need to be included at the close of the season. I imagine that a fair amount of the start of TWOW will have to be placed at the conclusion of the season covering ADWD because of GRRM skewing the timeline towards the end (some of the pre-released chapters occur before the end of ADWD). When the AFFC characters rejoin ADWD at around the 2/3rds mark, I doubt HBO will fork over money for huge battles at the beginning of the season as well as at the end (assuming some serious shit goes down at the end of TWOW) and they simply work to keep the season a little more self-contained and set up everything for the even bigger finale that will start with TWOW. 

So

Season 4: final 3rd of ASOS and non-timeline essential parts of AFFC/ADWD

Season 5: the bulk of a combined AFFC/ADWD

Season 6-8: TWOW and ADOS

Please let me know what you think and if I’ve missed anything. This is all speculation. What should the show do? What shouldn’t they do? What will they do?

Sorry about the wall of text but I was bored at work and have wanted to post this here for a while.

1363275330.0,1aaenu,(Spoilers All) Theory on Rhaegar's Plans ,Book_1love,224,37,68,"This is my first post

I'd like to submit my theory on Rhaegar's plans and goals before he died on the Battle of the Trident.  

It appeared to me on my second reading of the books that Rhaegar was planning to depose his father (likely non-violently) and become king.

I thought this based on the following events: 

Rhaegar tells Jamie before he leaves for his final battle that he is going to make some changes to the way things are run when he returns.  As only the heir to the throne, which would make it unlikely for him to listen to any suggestions Rhaegar may have given him.

Rhaegar's wife Elia and their children are effectively acting as Arey's hostages at this point.  He keeps them close by him to ensure Rhaegar's loyalty.  Rhaegar's response to this is to find a new wife (Lyanna Stark) and hide her not only from her own family and former fiance

Rhaegar sets tells the most loyal members of the Kingsguard his plans, he will still have an heir and the crown will not pass to his little brother Viserys (Jaime Lannister and Barristan Selmy noticed that Viserys might be mad when he was a child, so its not unreasonable to think that Rhaegar noticed as well)

He takes the remaining members of the Kingsguard, least experienced and least politically savvy of the Kingsguard, with him to battle Robert Baratheon.  He may have also told Barristan, Lewyn Martell and Jonothor Darry his plans, or maybe he didn't but hoped that removing them from the capital would allow for a smoother transition to power (in case they were not ready to support his claim).

I would also argue that Rhaegar  planned to stage a non-violent coup, and the fact that once the Kingsguard was removed, Aerys had almost no powerful supporters due to his craziness (after alienating Tywin Lannister and exiling/murdering his other Hands) and wouldn't have been much of a threat (his current Hand Rossart, is clearly a lackey without the command of any troops of his own, besides the pyromancers, who are not warriors and could be easily subdued)

If Rhaegar had been able to end the rebellion, or offered to marry Cersei to Viserys).
He could have exiled his father to Dragonstone with a small contingent of guards and become a beloved and effective ruler

TL;DL: Rhaegar planned to depose his father and take over the Iron Throne himself before he was killed.

1370783261.0,1fz9nk,(Spoilers ALL) Lady Stoneheart and the Rape-Revenge story trope,Bookshelfstud,234,50,131,"There's this genre known as ""Rape and revenge"" stories (here's a [tvtropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAndRevenge) link for a fuller explanation and better examples). The general plot of each of them is that the main character, and the third act is her glorious revenge. The Kill Bill movies are probably the most well-known homage to this trope. I hadn't thought about Stoneheart as ""Rape and revenge"" character until now

The classic rape-revenge protagonist is usually sympathetic. I say usually; there have been some examples of the protagonist going just absolutely apeshit and doing things much worse than what was done to them. But the classic intent of this trope is to give the reader a cathartic experience - ""Yeah! Woohoo! The bad guys get it in the end!"" Given GRRM's propensity for just turning shit on its head left and right, while definitely rationalize-able from her perspective, is worrying. 

And now, because I honestly can't figure out how this is going to play out. It's a puzzle, really; two POVs headed towards LSH. Does Brienne kill Jaime in trial by combat? Vice versa, perhaps? Does Brienne kill LSH, breaking her oaths for Jaime? WHO KNOWS. 

But LSH is definitely some sort of send-up of the rape-revenge trope. ",self,t5_2r2o9,False,,SeaworthOfRainwood,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1fz9nk/spoilers_all_lady_stoneheart_and_the_raperevenge/

**Are there any characters that you think, have been handled more effectively than were their book counterparts? Any that you think were handled more effectively, period?**

My nominations:

* **Cersei** - book!Cersei is a more-or-less straight villain, I think, meant to inspire some sympathy for her in a similar fashion to the reveal about Jaime's reasons for killing Aerys, but came too little and too late. Cersei is still an antagonist on the show, no doubt, but the most excessively evil things that she does in the book are generally transferred to Joff and season one does a lot of work in establishing sympathetic reasons for the failure of her marriage to Robert, and honestly? I prefer the more balanced, well-rounded character and I think that this will make the AFFC reveal a lot more effective when they get there.
* **Shae** - More of a departure, whereas in the book I was frustrated at Tyrion for not seeing that coming when he's such an otherwise intelligent and savvy character. 
* **Theon** - while I'm not the biggest fan of how they're managing the pacing on his storyline this season

Ned finds his sister in a bed of blood with one child bearing dark hair and dark eyes like that of a Northerner, or since Eddard was an aquaintaince of Ashara's) who faked her death to raise Darkstar(named Gerold Dwayne after the two Kings guard members that died ""protecting"" him) in hiding and prevent people from asking questions. She raised the child as her own to replace the child she lost. 

Eddard then takes the child with the dark features North with him forsaking his own honor for his sister and naming him his bastard( then naming him after either Jon Arryn or Conning ton.)

This theory would also work with the title; Jon Snow as the calm, angry Southerner as Fire in A Song of Ice and Fire.

""I was not born blind, and watched the grey gulls flying in our wake. I was five-and-thirty and had been a maester of the chain for sixteen years. Egg wanted me to help him rule, but I knew my place was here. He sent me north aboard the *Golden Dragon*, and insisted that his friend Ser Duncan see me safe to Eastwatch. No recruit had arrived at the Wall with so much pomp since Nymeria sent the Watch six kings in golden fetters. Egg emptied out the dungeons too, so I would not need to say my vows alone. My honor guard, he called them. One was no less a man than Bryden Rivers. Later he was chosen lord commander."" ""Bloodraven?""

1339598394.0,uzv03,(Spoilers All) Euron Greyjoy,CranberryBogMonster,222,41,235,"Now that it's been a while since the most recent book and I've had months and months to think and rethink every little detail in the series

But one of the characters that I don't see mentioned as much is Euron, and what details we do have only serve to make him more difficult to figure out.

What is his endgame? On the one hand, that was never very likely. He was banished for raping Victarion's wife, which must have fueled his resentment for his family, and perhaps culminated in his decision to pay an assassin to take Balon's life so he could swoop in and claim the throne.

But if you ask me those ambitions seem too small for the man Euron has been sketched out to be. We know he has been traveling the breadth of the known world for years. He has an extensive knowledge of the mystical and the foreign: he's drunk shade of the evening, captured Pyat Pree and other warlocks from Qarth, an most important, acquired the dragon horn that he gave to Victarion before he left.

So how much does he really know, what exactly does he intend? He tells the Ironborn he wants to revive their ancient legacy and restore them as the terrifying reavers they once were, but as destructive as the Ironmen might have once been, possession of a dragon is simply orders of magnitude beyond it.

Does he want a coastal kingdom like in their glory days? Or does he want the throne itself? What might he know of the twisted game of politics on the mainland

To me Euron is particularly fascinating because there are no other villains like him. Varys is calculating, and when he makes his true strike, wherever it may be, it is going to be devastating and I don't think anyone will be able to anticipate it, even Varys.

We start the books in a land full of wonder, hardship, and actual human aspect of the various conflicts throughout the novels. Especially with characters like Sansa, but really across the board, we learn that the fairy tales aren't true - that the world is gritty, and real, and has ugly

Given this deconstruction of the fairy tale, and a sort of fairy tale feel to it. Yet, we as the readers will know the fairy tale is false, that in actuality there was ugliness and brutality throughout. I think this would bring the series full circle, we would see the fairy tale myth reconstructed with the characters from the books cast as the various heroes.

Now most people take this as being a blue winter rose: A symbol of Lyanna Stark. The crown that Rhaegar gave her at the tourney at Harrenhall was made of them and when Ned is hallucinating about the Tower of Joy he sees them. And the most common interpretation is that this represents Jon at the Wall

But I've not really seen the other character that the blue rose is associated with brought up in regards to this vision: Bael the Bard. Copied from the wiki at Westeros.org:

&gt; Bael the Bard climbed the Wall, Brandon Stark agreed to offer him one. The following morning the single virgin daughter of the lord had disappeared. In her bed was the blue winter rose Bael had received from her father.

Here the blue rose is representative of the daughter of the Lord of Winterfell who is stolen away but how could Bael the Bard be relevant now? Well if there's any still living characters that Bael and Lyanna are compared to it's Mance and Arya respectively. Arya is compared to Lyanna in looks and if she was also the Knight of the Laughing Tree that would probably give a tomboyish personality similar to Arya. Mance is quite directly compared to Bael the Bard and when he goes to rescue ""Arya Stark"" from Winterfell he takes on the name Abel

As a preface, during this time. The wolf escaped at the bidding of Arya and Jory after it bit Joffrey on their way to King's Landing. Around this time in the books, nearly every character in the riverlands mentions at one point or another about a huge pack of wolves that is running around terrorizing the countryside, and that they are led by one gigantic wolf. This is heavily implied to be Nymeria. Okay, back to the quotes:

1. During Arya's last chapter, beyond the godswood and the immense stone walls of Harrenhal, from somewhere out in the world, came the long lonely howl of a wolf. Gooseprickle's rose on Arya's skin and for an instant she felt dizzy""*. After this, Arya hears her father's voice telling her to be strong, and that she *""has the wolf blood in her""*. As she lays in bed later that night, *""she could hear the sound of her own breath, a great pack of them now. They are closer than the one I heard in the godswood, coming back through time using weirnet(edit: this is not possible, and had honestly forgotten it ever happened.

2. Now we go to Arya's first Chapter of ASoS. She has just killed the sentry and escaped with Gendry and Hot Pie. She knows that they will be pursued because of the killed guard, and deprives them of sleep. Here's the first quote from ASoS: *""she should be more frightened herself, she knew. She was only ten, a skinny girl on a stolen horse with a dark forest ahead of her and men behind her who would gladly cut off her feet. Yet somehow she felt calmer than she ever had in Harrenhal. The rain had washed the guard's blood off her fingers, she wore a sword across her back, wolves were prowling through the night like lean grey shadows.""* So all of a sudden after Arya has this touch with either Bran or Bloodraven, she is feeling super badass instead of afraid, but also that these wolves are a source of **safety** to her. During ACoK she is terrified of wolves in the woods.

3. Later on in the chapter, she spied dark shapes crossing a stream in the valley behind them, and for half a heartbeat she feared that Roose Bolton's riders were on them, but when she looked again she realized they were only a pack of wolves. She cupped her hands around her mouth and howled down at them, 'ahooooooooo, ahoooooooooooo.' When the largest of the wolves lifted it's head and howled back, the sound made Arya shiver.""* So now we have total proof that Nymeria's pack seems to be following Arya and protecting her. On top of this, and ""the largest""(Nymeria) howls back at her.

4. Finally the three cannot ride any longer and doze in their saddles, she dreams that she is Nymeria with her pack and she is mercilessly slaughtering Bloody Mummers in order to protect herself. 

That's all

**TL;DR:** Arya communicated with either Bran or Bloodraven while she was in Harrenhal, and she wargs into Nymeria during a dream and fights the exact Brave Companion men that are coming to recapture her.

1368038942.0,1dy4u2,(Spoilers All) My take on the Knight of the Laughing Tree,DatGrag,231,56,91,"This may get a bit long, and the mystery knight who dominated there. Some will include popular speculation

The story is introduced by Meera: ""in the year of the false spring. The Knight of the Laughing Tree, or is there a deeper meaning here?

The story begins with a Crannogman who is clearly special from a young age, and when spring broke and he left, he found himself walking into a tournament.

*Quick Break:* So I'm pretty convinced here that this crannogman is almost definitely Howland Reed. I consider this story to be almost proof that he definitely has some *sick* magical powers that he is most likely using in a similar manner to what Bloodraven has done with Bran. Howland is watching. 

Back to the story

At this point, he runs into some Freys. If you don't know, the Freys live very close to the swamps and generally hate people like the Reeds. The Walders at Winterfell both shit on the Reeds constantly. Howland runs into these Freys, three squires, and they rough him up a bit, kicking him on the ground. ""That's my father's(Rickard Stark's) man you're kicking, howled the She-Wolf.(Lyanna Stark)"" Lyanna enters the story for the first time, ""The she-wolf laid into the squires with a tourney sword, the quiet wolf beside him (Eddard Stark)

Lyanna *insists* that Howland attend the feast that was to come for the tourney at Harrenhal. He was of high birth, we get the famous ""The dragon prince sang a song so sad it made the wolf maid sniffle, but when her pup brother teased her for crying she poured wine over his head."" Howland spots the Freys who beat him up, and Lyanna offers to find *Howland* some armor so he can take revenge on them. Howland thinks about it, but decides he is too shitty of a warrior and better to not attempt it. Howland sleeps in the Stark tent that night, and just outside the tent he says a prayer to the old gods for someone to take revenge on the Freys. 

It is my belief that, that she overheard this prayer.

The day of the tourney the Frey's knights are doing really well, and clad in ill-fitting armor made up of bits and pieces. The device upon it was heart tree of the old gods, a white weirwood with a laughing red face."" Lyanna likely painted the device to make it seem as though Howland's prayers had been answered. The mystery knight challenged the three knights of the squires who beat up Howland.When the Frey knights went to give the ransom, The knight answered in a ""booming voice"" through her huge helm saying ""Teach your squires honor, that shall be ransom enough."" Remember, Loras has been quoted as saying that being good at jousting only really requires skill on horseback, and we know Lyanna was one of the best horse riders of her time.

Later that knight, who claims all he ever found was his shield with the laughing tree. My theory as that Rhaegar succeeded in finding out Lyanna was the KotLT, and instantly falls in love with her because of it. Lyanna has already been wooed by Rhaegar's singing the night before, so the match is super possible. They spend some time together, Rhaegar decides to lie to his father and say he never found the knight. The KotLT never shows her face at the tourney again, and Rhaegar goes on to win the tournament.

Meera goes on to say that Rhaegar named Lyanna queen of love and beauty

**TL;DR:**

Lyanna was the KotLT.

Her idea to become a mystery knight and protect Howland Reed is the initial reason Rhaegar noticed her and was interested in her.

All of this is the catalyst for RLJ

Howland Reed has some decent ""green"" powers.

Young good looking man becomes King. Starts eating and whoring and disrespecting his marriage. Fathers numerous bastards. Wife seeks comfort in the arms of her brother, which is disregarded by his wife who was sick of him, and thus the illegitimate son of the Queen and her brother sits the Iron Throne, while the honorable, rightful heir tries to tell everyone about his right and wages war against the pretender occupying the throne.

__TL;DR - Stuff about Hospitality laws and Game Theory

###In honor of Sunday's glorious events this post is specifically built around the Wedding Party.

The laws of hospitality protect guests and more specifically people on diplomatic missions. You feed the message bearer salt and bread so he doesn't have to worry about getting his throat slit for his lords parchment (it is also an incentive for lords to go to other castles and try to make deals and shit). 

Player A has a decision to make, which means every slighted house _should_ (if they took game theory classes or are a ""rational actor"") punish the defector on every turn until the game ends (death for A or B). 
  
Roose and Walder defected and if Westerosi society has any wish of normalizing they have to reset the game because now it is stuck in grim trigger mode. Manderly is following the proper strategy, Walder and everyone involved in the killing will all be murdered. The Dreadfort and the Twins will probably go to some other families.

-  Start of writing to to publication of ""A Game of Thrones"": 1991-Aug 1996

Writing Time: 5 years/2 years

At first glance it seems like the first and shortest of the novels in ASOIAF took him a good deal of time to write, his main gig was still screenwriting at the time, and for three years after he started AGoT was sparingly being written.  GRRM didn't really start working on the first novel ""in earnest"" until 1994...  So if you want to look at this honestly it really only took him about a couple of years to get out the first novel..


-  ""A Game of Thrones"" Aug 1996 - ""A Clash of Kings"" Feb 1999

Publication Gap: 2 years

The second novel was more rich, Martin now working on an Epic Fantasy series was able to expand his world building and create a plethora of new characters and interweave them into a better follow up in only 2 and a half years, not to mention the first of the Dunk and Egg novellas ""The Hedge Knight"" was published during this time. 

- ""A Clash of Kings"" Feb 1999 - ""A Storm of Swords"" Aug 2000(UK)/Nov 2000(US)

Publication Gap: 1 year

Wow, and one of the longest and densest novels in the series.  And according to the Wiki of Ice and Fire (where I'm sourcing these dates from), ASOS was considered ""several months late"" by his publishers.  But still, seeing this fact can't help but make someone optimistic for TWOW.

---------------

Now to the not-so-good publication times going into the two most recent novels, and why since those issues no longer plague him that these worries are (to a degree) somewhat in-founded.

- ""A Storm of Swords"" Aug 2000 - ""A Feast for Crows"" Oct 2005

Publication Gap: 5 years

To understand why GRRM took so long to write book 4, including several more viewpoint characters, and had to start the book from scratch.  But the real biggest set back came when the Novel's length had grow larger than the 1500 manuscript page length of ASOS with (directly quoting GRRM here), ""No foreseeable end in sight"", he determined he would have to split the book in half.  As most people know (readers as well as non readers) ""A Feast for Crows"" and ""A Dance With Dragons"" were split geographically, not chronologically, and only half of the characters appeared in book 4, almost start the book from scratch as many re-writes and edits were required to release the book in this fashion... but finally after 5 years ""A Feast for Crows"" was published.  He did however also publish the 2nd Dunk and Egg during this time as well

- ""A Feast for Crows"" Oct 2005 - "" A Dance with Dragons"" July 2011

Publication Gap: 5 years

With AFFC finished and GRRM heading into book ADWD readers were given a promise by GRRM when he stated that book 5 would ""be out next year"" in a authors's note present in AFFC.  GRRM also stated at that time that ADWD was half finished to back that up.  Since he didn't dispose of the ADWD POV chapters that were already written when ADWD and AFFC were one book, you guessed it.... Scratch.  Whereas the problem with AFFC long write time was the decision to split the novel that forced re-writes, the big problem was organization and where to fit and how to structure ADWD. Not only was ADWD an organizational nightmare for GRRM, just within itself (more on that in a second), but he had to take great lengths to make sure the even though the books were split that the events taking place are chronologically in order. (Certain characters make references to other plot threads, and plot threads relate to each other cross-book). And making that all consistent was a major hurtle and influenced the long delay. But the biggest reason GRRM cites as his delay for ADWD is the ""Mereenese Knot"" (don't google that non-readers) which, without going into spoilers, you know how interwoven some of these plot threads are and how such a thing could pose a problem.

Another thing to take into consideration into the delay for ADWD was the start of the HBO adaption of the novels that began in when HBO acquired the rights and started work on the show in the late 2000s... I'm not too sure of how involved George was early on, a considerable amount of his time was taken away by the show.  George also wrote and published the 3rd Dunk&amp;Egg novella during this time as well.  

- A bit of Optimism for a quick(er) ""Winds of Winter"" 

If there is any good news in looking forward to a quicker book 6, with the struggles of Feast and Dance behind him, see no reason fans should be overly worried about the final two books taking an overly long time to be finished, when he's demonstrated that when he writing on a focused story he can do it well and quickly.  

I don't expect the short gaps in publication for the final 2 books that we saw with the first 3, and still acts as an EP and consultant for the HBO show; as well as several public appearences he's made and interviews he's done are a large part of that distraction.  But I also think people over estimate exactly how much of a distraction it really is.  Several evenings a year to make these appearences, and some time to write a screenplay are not as large of a distraction as I think people make it out to be.  

I think it's within reason, but I'm optimistic that the light at the end of the tunnel is within Martin's view.  I also think while it will be close, that if GRRM keeps up a good pace ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" will be finished up with a nice lead way ahead of the show when ""A Dream of Spring"" will eventually be published..

These are of course my opinions

1347900700.0,1012qg,(Spoilers / Speculation) Where in seven hells is Benjen?,tinydan,211,43,309,"Ok so we all know Benjen has been lost and assumed dead by many in the nights watch since he left in game of thrones. I’ve read theories that he is dead but resurrected and is now coldhands, tree-Bran would find out.

So if Benjen is not Coldhands or a warg

**Tin foil hats on past this point**

Benjen has a rangers mentality, most likely in an attempt to help the watch. There is much we don’t know about the others, other than (haarr) they’re smarter than the mindless wights they command. From what we have seen they have a language, fight like knights, armoured and armed with swords, and perhaps have a sense of honour, standing back to allow Waymar Royce fight one instead of many in the prologue though that may have been for fun. I do not believe they would kill a man like Benjen if they knew who he was; neither would they kill a man unless they didn’t have a reason for him to live. For this reasoning why would he be with them?

Benjen has been north of the wall for a while and has had time to discover things long forgotten by the watch. It is very likely that he has been in touch with the children of the forest or wildlings who know about the effectiveness of Dragonglass against the others and about the horn of Joramun

With no idea where or how I believe Benjen found the true horn of Joramun and stored it along with his cache of dragonglass at the fist when he knew he was done for in order to keep it out of the hands of the others. The cloak there was in too good condition to have been there for a long time so it stands to reason that the ranger to go north recently would have been likely to have stored it there. Being a man of forward thinking Benjen would have know the fist was a likely stopping point for any man

So his knowledge of the horn and perhaps his station in the watch and the north has kept him breathing. This is all going on his the assumption that the others can use the horn to bring down the wall and therefore the magic that prevents them from passing. This would explain their presence at the fist; the watch being a hindrance to them getting the horn and an added bonus

What purpose do the Others have for Benjen now? Only the weirwoods know but he could be attempting some form of diplomacy or it could be a darker reason. He could be a hostage

So that’s my tinfoil essay

I wish to produce some text evidence to support a new theory:

-----
Jeyne Poole wept so hysterically [after Ser Hugh is killed] that Septa Mordane finally took her off to regain her composure
-----

-----
By then Septa Mordane had returned
-----

It would be extremely unlikely for Jeyne to become ill in such a short period of time. While Septa Mordane is an honest woman, then, is a euphemistic excuse of Septa Mordane to avoid more embarrassing truths. Tyrion comments that most men deny hard truths; perhaps courtesy at court is to conceal hard truths.

-----
He [Joffrey] raised his hand to summon a servant with a flagon of iced summerwine, so she nodded and thanked him graciously and said not another word.
-----

Here we see that Septa Mordane drinks alcohol.

-----
Even Septa Mordane was helpless before him [Moon Boy]; when he sang his little song about the High Septon

-----
She looked for Septa Mordane

My theory here is that Septa Mordane has had enough alcohol to become very drunk. She is not simply clumsy

-----
Ned walked with the king to the jousting field. He had promised to watch the final tilts with Sansa; Septa Mordane was ill today
-----

Here is the tinfoil part of my theory: Septa Mordane is not ill; she has a hangover. This is why she misses the last day of jousting. She is using the same ""ill"" euphemism she used just a day earlier about hysterical Jeyne.

* Rhaegar
* Lyanna
* Eddard
* Ashara
* Septa Lemore
* Jon Snow

----
First

----
**Ashara Dayne**

Ashara Dayne was a noblewoman of House Dayne

Ashara was tall, according to rumor, Eddard Stark.

Ashara was a lady-in-waiting to Princess Elia Martell. She was present at the Tourney at Harrenhal
After the events of the Tower of Joy, called the Palestone Sword, on the cliff atop the sea. Her body was never recovered. After these events, Ned Stark returned to Winterfell with the infant Jon Snow, whom he claimed as his bastard son, refusing to name the child's mother. This sparked rumors that Ashara had been the mother of Stark's bastard, and that grief at learning that her lover had been responsible for her brother's death was the cause of her suicide.
Ser Barristan Selmy believes that Ashara gave birth to a stillborn daughter. According to Selmy, Selmy thinks that he could have prevented Ashara's suicide if she had known of his feelings for her; that he thinks would have led her to seek his aid instead of a Stark's aid.

**Ned Stark**

[...] Once the conflict had ended and Robert had taken the throne, Jon, about whose origins he refused to speak, even to his own wife; he quickly silenced rumors that the boy's mother was the Dornish noblewoman Ashara Dayne.[...]

----

My question: Why are the subtles hints of R+L=J accepted as hard rock canon by most of ASoIaF fans while not-so-subtle hints of Ned + Ashara are constantly overlooked.
----

**Things that are well hinted or known inside the Lore**

* Ned and Ashara had a thing.
* Ned visited her
* She jumped of a tower after Ned visited her.
* Ned gets furious when he hear talks of Jon being the child of Ashara

----

**Relevant Book Parts:**

* Cat

&gt; Ned would not speak of the mother, and Catelyn heard her maids repeating tales they heard from the lips of her husband's soldiers. They whispered of Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, deadliest of the seven knights of Aerys's Kingsguard, and of how their young lord had slain him in single combat. And they told how afterward Ned had carried Ser Arthur's sword back to the beautiful young sister who awaited him in a castle called Starfall on the shores of the Summer Sea. The Lady Ashara Dayne, tall and fair, with haunting violet eyes.

* Cersei:
* 
&gt; You've a bastard of your own, the Lady Ashara? She threw herself into the sea, I'm told. Why was that? For the brother you slew, or the child you stole?

* Cat:
* 
&gt; If Jon had been born of Ashara Dayne of Starfall

* Harwin:
* 
&gt; ""Aye, when I was no older than you are now."" He took hold of her bridle firmly and turned her horse around. ""I doubt there's any truth to it. But if there is, what of it? When Ned met this Dornish lady, his brother Brandon was still alive, and it was him betrothed to Lady Catelyn, so there's no stain on your father's honor. There's nought like a tourney to make the blood run hot, so maybe some words were whispered in a tent of a night, maybe more

* Jojen on KotLT:
* 
&gt; the knight of skulls and kisses in a wine-cup war. The crannogman saw a maid with laughing purple eyes dance with a white sword, and lastly with the quiet wolf ... but only after the wild wolf spoke to her on behalf of a brother too shy to leave his bench.

----

**Bonus Facts:**

- Wylla was Ashara's servant

- GRRM:

QUESTION (1): will we learn more about the Sword of Morning? And

ANSWER: Yes (regarding Sword of Morning); no comment about Ashara; and ""Have some more cheetos."" *GRRM grin*

QUESTION (2): I will spare you the rest of my speculations about the date of Jon's birth

ANSWER:As to your speculations about Catelyn and Ashara Dayne... sigh... needless to say, as some of the fans who write me seem to assume. They have horses in Dorne too, you know. And boats (though not many of their own). As a matter of fact (a tiny tidbit from SOS), she was one of Princess Elia's lady companions in King's Landing, in the first few years after Elia married Rhaegar.

1340120265.0,va2tb,"(Spoiler Speculation ALL) Mental state of a Greyjoy, 
theory.",48,124,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/va2tb/spoiler_speculation_all_mental_state_of_a_greyjoy/,"No, not that one without his skin. Or that other one-eyed one. Nor wet one. Nor the who fell off a bridge. That other one. Victarion.(even though on mental issues he's a bit overshadowed).

So the question is:

Does Victarion Greyjoy have aspgergers

(NOTE: I'm using the 'old' portrayal of these kinds of mental conditions

Reading through Vic's chapters, but on the whole, Vic's chapters feel more different to me than any other POV.

But there are a few individual phrases and other thoughts throughout his POV that got me thinking about this. Things like Victarion's views on laughter.

* ""Victarion Greyjoy mistrusted laughter. The sound of it always left him with the uneasy feeling that he was the butt of some jape he did not understand. Euron Crow’s Eye had oft made mock of him when they were boys. So had Aeron, boiling up in the back of his throat until he was like to choke upon the taste. That was how he felt about the monkeys. Their antics never brought so much as a smile to the captain’s face, though his crew would roar and hoot and whistle.""

That kind of dissonance between him and everyone around him

I can't remember a single actual example of empathy being shown by him to any character. In many battle scenes throughout the series, and Brienne's internal dialogue whether she can kill without hesitation, will she be able to ignore a person's humanity at the crucial point? 

But from all the battles from Vic's view, (or at least never shows the capability), of thinking inside someone else's head, of seeing another's point of view. Almost as if he assumes that the world as seen through his eyes is the same one everyone else must see. One line in ADWD, and it's implications, could be a hint towards this.

* ""The dragon queen awaits me in Meereen.""

At face value this looks like an announcement of intentions with a combination of a bit boasting

And does Vic actually have any friends? I know these are hard men, who he uses as something to wank into.

His perceived ""simpleness"" was another thing thing that piqued my interest. He portrays himself at the Kingsmoot as nothing more than the continuation of the old line. Everything he says is short and concise. He never makes any metaphors

He states that it is his duty to obey his elder brothers in all things.

He kills his wife, constantly rationalizing it to himself that it was right, and when he thinks about it, his wife isn't even that important in the thought. It is *Euron* that occupies this obsession. Because it humiliated him. 

And yet he obeys Euron once he has been crowned

This kind of almost blind adherence to a system of codes and rules makes Stannis look like Littlefinger. He thinks that if the rules are followed

Any of these things on their own could be seen as the manifestations of a very rigid personality. But combined together

Remember

* Beat it out of him. Then beat harder.

* Keep him out of sight

* Send him to the Wall/wolves

We know the Greyjoys didn't exactly grow up in an understanding and nurturing climate. Their childhoods were hard and hellish by all accounts. I'm willing to bet that is was all stick and no carrot. Can you imagine a childhood on the Islands that doesn't involve hellish beatings for not falling in line and acting 'normal'?

 I think the Iron Islands are the only place in the world that Victarion could 'hide' his mental states in the already existing insanity of the Iron Islanders. In fact

(And of course this being a fantasy world, then it could be an aspect taken from disease.)

TL;dr: Vicky-Joy has some sort of autism or aspergers that's not only exacerbated by the barbarity of the Islands

Signs of some mental disorder;

* No understanding of humour.

* No empathy.

* No emotional expression at all to people he acknowledges as human.

* Rigid

* Possibly doesn't understand that others actually think differently from him

* Obsesses over those who break the 'code' (Euron).",self,t5_2r2o9,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/va2tb/spoiler_speculation_all_mental_state_of_a_greyjoy/

&gt; “One of Lady Maege’s daughters

&gt; “To curry your lord father’s favor

&gt; Jon had to think a moment. “Ten. Or near enough to make no matter. Might I know how she has offended Your Grace?”

Last year's tournament was run by then-crow

What was the primary complaint? Simple: that the tournament postings were cluttering up the front page of our subreddit and distracting from serious discussion about the books. Whenever someone PM'd us mods with such a concern

Today user /u/asoiafmadness took the initiative to start his own March Madness style tournament [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1aos4m/spoilers_all_rasoiafs_64character_march_madness/). The post has been removed. 

It is the belief of the maesters that having multiple tournaments a year is not a good idea for this subreddit. Not only would they begin to pile up and overrun this subreddit but also it'd be like having multiple World Series' a year: eventually it'd feel like ""everybody gets a trophy!"" day. 

There should be one champion a year and one time of year *only* where a tournament takes place on this subreddit.

It is our hope that /u/asoiafmadness will work with us this **coming June** to help manage the next tourney. Clearly this crow has the chops and the enthusiasm to help make the **Tournament of Ice and Fire III** the best one yet.

2.	Trust no one. Period. Not your friends. Not your family. Not your house. No one.

With the burden of honor and trust off your back you are ready to play the game of thrones. While playing there are certain rules you should keep in mind.

1.	Killing children. In the game of the thrones, sending assassins after heirs to the throne, and killing kingly bastards are all things you should be doing while playing the game of thrones.

2.	Keep a personal food tester. If you are playing the game of thrones

3.	Never travel by ship in autumn. Ever. Statistics from Oldtown show that 99% of ships are lost in the autumn and that of the 1% of the ships that do make it to their destination, you will get laid.

4.	Religion. Choose the Red God. Happen to be poisoned. BAM, Red God. The Red God is definitely the best choice.

5.	Never put money in your mouth. You never know if there is left over poison on it from a Faceless Man assassination.

This is just a start for the ultimate guide. Are there more that you can come up with?

On Coldhands my main issue is rationalising how what appears likely to be a 'Wight' of a dead member of the Night's Watch could behave differently to other Wights. As with any magic in fantasy it is far strongest with some sort of rational basis or 'science' behind it.

   Ned gets to the TOJ to claim his sister, etc.  (Again, these thoughts are based on the assumption that Jon is a Targ, and would be king instead of Viserys.)

   Think about how much that must have **sucked** for Ned!  He:

* is fresh off a years long war in which he led rebellion armies and saw thousands on both sides die - all to depose a (totally batshit) Targaryen king
* already has a taste of disgust for his best friend Robert when Tywin presented Rhaegar's murdered children and all Robert did was smile
*  has just discovered his sister has created a new king
* has to promise to keep the baby's identity safe to protect him from Robert
* just helped to kill three Kingsguard who were totally in the right by protecting Jon


   While choosing anything else was probably never going to happen, his new wife was humiliated, the boy who should have been king had to live the life of a northern bastard, who wound up at the Wall.  Ned had to carry all of that.  No wonder he felt such guilt.

*""Thousands of years ago, and wept, and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks...In that darkness the White Walkers came for the first time. They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds...""*

It is basically the same with as in IRL europe - 
*Mothers killed their own children, spiderwebs grew in empty shacks, moss lingered on statues, open stinking massgraves everywhere, demons and foul minions rode on great hellish felhounds, everyone believed the great death was a punishment sent from God, or the Satan was unleashing the plague to pull with the sinners down to the eternal flames!*

With that said, he is taking the great [Black Death](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death) as inspiration, transforming it from a pathogen infection into the Others.

And in any of those scenario's that opens up Jon to be resurrected and possibly becoming Lord of Winterfell, a piece of The Three Headed Dragon or any of the other theories floating around here.  

I don't even think it's worth discussing the possibility that Jon won't come alive again one way or another

I also think that this will be the event that rallies the Seven Kingdoms to turn their focus away from fighting each other and to focus on the real looming threat

So I made a lot of changes; the biggest being the info boxes that pop up.  All the info is basically copy/pasted from [AWOIAF](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Main_Page).  I modified some of it and changed the formatting obviously.  I didn't proofread it all so there may be errors or typos here and there.  I'll fix them if you let me know.

All the info is as of the beginning of AGOT, I won't add anything that is somewhat speculative.

###POSSIBLE FUTURE UPDATES

**AMOIAF Lite:**  Let me know how this latest version performs on lower-end computers.  It's all vector graphics and text so the file size is &lt;1MB and I think it should work well on most any computer.  But if it's inordinately slow on lower-end computers I may make a ""lite"" version without certain features.

**AMOIAF Uber:** I also may make a jumbo sized version for displaying at higher resolutions (obviously you'd need a fast machine for it to work smoothly).

**A Guide of Ice and Fire:** I realize that a lot of people would love to see a chronological timeline.  You could see characters moving, and text notifications of major events.  Play, pause, and skip to different timepoints/chapters.  I could probably implement all of the functionality.  However, I wonder what you guys think is the best chronological timeline out there.  I haven't done much research into this yet, but is there a universally agreed upon timeline?  What is the best one to go by?  If there isn't a good one maybe you guys could help make one for me so I can make the Guide.",,self,EuronCrowsEye,
1340472497.0,vhmdz,The Battle of the Green Fork: Analysis. [Spoilers thru ASOS],lordhadri,181,20,47,"Enough speculation topics about the unwritten books. let's talk about a major event in the first one!

The Battle of the Green Fork is, but then doesn't give a similarly detailed description of the Stark army. His confusion during the battle makes it hard to understand what really happened. And finally, we don't even see this Stark army again for another book and a half so we don't know how bad the losses were.

Another thing that always confused me was Tyrion's squadron described as ""the Left"" and ""the Vanguard"" at the same time

After a careful reading of Chapter 62 (Tyrion XIII) I have produced this crudely-drawn tactical map of [The Battle of the Green Fork.](https://imgur.com/cZUGK)

**The Lannister Army:** 20

* The Center: About 10

* The Van: A mixed force of mounted mercenaries

* The Right: 4

* The Reserve: 2

**The Army of the North**

* 16, under the command of Roose Bolton.

When looking at the battle visually

First: Tywin says he intentionally deployed weak troops on the Left, and that he trusts his lords to have the discipline to carry out those plans. This is why Tywin was considered the best general in Westeros.

Second: **What is Roose Bolton thinking here?** He must know how difficult this battle is to win. Yet he deploys spearmen offensively and advances on a line of Lannister cavalry. There's just no way this attack plan could work. Why didn't he find a hill to defend and let the Lannisters come to him? Is Roose just inexperienced?

But let's look carefully at how he deployed his men. The Stark army took thousands of casualties, he was able to retire with much of the army still intact, but left his fellow lords behind.

Finally, no matter how disciplined, cannot overwhelm a polearm formation unless the formation is disrupted, such as happened at the [Battle of Hastings.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_hastings) Like William the Conqueror, Tywin utilizes combined arms: his archers force Stark infantry to the left flank where he wants them to attack. Clegane's headlong charge into the Karstark shield wall would have been wasteful, if it had not been Tywin's intention to join the battle on the left where he could not be outflanked thanks to the river.

##1. The (Spoiler Tagging) System for Post Titles

**All** threads should have a spoiler tag associated with them. Please choose ONLY from the examples [listed in the FAQs](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/wiki/faq#wiki_2._how_should_i_title_my_thread.3F)

Spoiler tags *set* the level of spoilers in a post. They do not try to anticipate them. Therefore, set. This means that ""Possible Spoilers"" or ""Potential Spoilers"" or any iteration thereof are not valid choices and will be removed by a moderator.

Similarly

**Please use the spoiler tags listed in the FAQs or on the submit page exactly as they're written. Those are the available options.**

##2. Spoiler Tags in Titles -- Specifically

There has been some confusion recently on when to use (No Spoilers). From the FAQ:

&gt; * Use (No Spoilers) when there are no spoilers in the post you are submitting or you don’t reasonably expect there to be spoilers.

&gt; * (No Spoilers) What other book series are similar to ASOIAF? would be a correct usage of (No Spoilers). Answers won’t likely contain spoilers.

&gt; * If you ask “What happens to Ned during Game of Thrones?” and claim “No Spoiler”

The third scenario is what we’ve run into most often recently. We will continue to remove these posts. 

##3. Spoiler Tags in Titles -- What do they Mean?

Spoiler tags in titles denote what scope the discussion is going to take. They *do not denote which book you’re referencing*. This is why most of the posts in /r/asoiaf are (Spoilers All). The discussions can encompass all of the books, the preview chapters, and anything GRRM has said. 

A discussion about events from ACOK has a different tone when the spoiler tag is ACOK vs. All. Things can be discussed in context of the larger story

This won’t apply in quite the same way to current readers. Your spoiler scope will likely be set to the book you’ve just finished rather than (Spoilers All). Still

##4. Memes and other ""Silly Content""

Our [meme policy](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/wiki/faq#wiki_15._what_is_your_policy_on_memes_and_.22silly.22_content.3F) applies to posts in /r/asoiaf. 

A meme or silly content submission shall be considered any post intended for the sole purpose of eliciting laughter while not contributing to or beginning serious and/or interesting discussion about the A Song of Ice and Fire universe. This includes links to advice-animal style memes, parody videos, pun-filled self-post threads, and any other content deemed to be of no intrinsic value to the /r/asoiaf community as determined by the maesters.

Photos, news articles, and any other post that leads to interesting discussion shall still be allowed even if said post involves crazy, tin-foil-hat style speculation.

Anything that falls under the ""silly content"" category will be removed by moderators.

##5. Off topic posts

We try to keep all of the content here in /r/asoiaf as on topic as we can. Posts like ""So glad I found this place"" or ""How I feel about this subreddit"" don't fall under on-topic. We're glad you're here too. Let's just show our appreciation for each other by providing lots of tinfoil and merlings

Jon Snow in Season 2 has been discussed at length. His journey with Qhorin was just so tepid compared to the books. Qhorin's excellent speech after Jon freed Ygritte, etc. This problem was continued into Season 3 when he met Mance Rayder. Rather than an interesting discussion on exclusion and freedom, we got ""Ah dun' lahk thaht Crahstah is killun 'ez suhns!""

But the worst part for me? Jon Snow is a WARG. His connection with Ghost is arguably just as important as Bran's greensight. Jon has always been close with the old gods, and Jon's connection with Ghost helped Jon and his brothers scout out the wildlings in the Frostfangs. Then Jon meets Orell (noted warg), which meant a lot more in the books since Jon is sorta onto the fact that he's a warg too. Instead, the meeting with Orell doesn't really land.

And it seems to be perfectly within NW guidelines for a NW member to visit his family, should he have any... As seen with Benjen Stark.  We cannot Also forget that the NW also turns a blind eye to the constitutionals it's members take in Mole Town. 

So if a Night's Watch member has to move about the realm for legitimate ""non desertion"" reasons

Does a NW member have to carry around documentation wherever he goes to prove he's not a deserter?  It would seem to be a good excuse for a nights watch deserter or a group of deserters to say that there on nights watch business should they be arrested.

Tyrion wakes up scarred with no nose after an attempt on his life. He immediately seeks out his father, impressed by his son's change in demeanor and talents at grinding his teeth while frowning.  Tyrion would accept his role in the marriage of Sansa because it's his duty, consummate the marriage, and prepare to move North as warden. Before he leaves, after investigating the attempt on his life,  Tywin is poisoned by someone and Tyrion flees to the Westerlands to investigate and rally troops. 

Stannis sulks back in Dragonstone.  Stannis gets the itch and goes to his wifes quarters, he falls into a melancholy state until Davos brings him the Black Letter.  Since he has a deep fascination with The Wall, he embarks to save it.  He arrives just in time to save the Nights Watch, though sustains many more casualties.

1337807151.0,u1mb4,(Spoilers ALL) My take on the Jeyne Westerling theory,galanix,182,27,180,"I know the Jeyne Westerling impostor theory has been discussed here before

**THE THEORY**

Brynden ""Blackfish"" Tully escaped Riverrun with the real Jeyne Westerling.  The Jeyne encountered by Jaime after the siege of Riverrun was actually Elenya (Jeyne's younger sister).  Jeyne fled with Brynden because she was pregnant with ~~had given birth to~~ Robb's heir and wanted to protect it and herself from the Lannisters.


**THE EVIDENCE**

**Hips don't lie**

ASOS - Chapter 14 (Catelyn II):
&gt;She was pretty, and that shy smile. Slender, but with good hips, Catelyn noted. She should have no trouble bearing children, at least.

AFFC - Chapter 44 (Jaime VII):
&gt;Jeyne was a willowy girl, breasts the size of apples, a mop of chestnut curls, and the soft brown eyes of a doe. Pretty enough for a child, Jaime decided, but not a girl to lose a kingdom for. Her face was puffy, and there was a scab on her forehead

The most notable incongruity is her having ""good hips"" vs ""narrow hips"".  Catelyn describes her as ""pretty

**What makes me think she was switched with Elenya (her younger sister)?**

Elenya would have been thirteen at the end of the siege, and young Rollam, Robb’s squire"" (ASOS 45).  Yet there is no mention of Elenya post-siege.  Jaime meets Jeyne, Lady Sybell says “Rollam is with me"", and Jaime even sees Lord Gawen Westerling, but Elenya is never seen nor mentioned as being in Riverrun. 

Also, uncontrollable, and like a frightened animal.  Does this sound like the courteous dignified 17-year-old Jeyne, or the impetuous behavior of a 13-year-old, being forced to play into a farce?  The explanation of this is that she is grieving for Robb, who is dead for ~~a year~~ about 5 months at this point.  Meanwhile, Lady Sybell (the mother) is there the whole time looming over fake-Jeyne, she even slaps her at one point.

**But didn't Lady Sybell give Jeyne 'moon tea' every morning to keep her from getting pregnant

We don't know the efficacy of moon tea

EDIT: courtesy of /u/Jilax  
&gt;From AWOIAF: Flower tansy, a spoon of honey, and a drop of pennyroyal. This is the recipe for Moon tea. That's definietly not what Jeyne was drinking....

Keep in mind she's a Spicer, the old crone who gave Cersei the valonqar prophecy.  Maybe Maggy gave Sybell a prophecy of her own about Jeyne.  The point is there's a lot of murky area where this family is concerned, it wouldn't surprise me if she's playing both sides.

Plus the Blackfish has always been about ""Famiy

**Foreshadowing**

An absolute ton of foreshadowing about Jeyne being pregnant and the danger her baby would pose.

ASOS - Chapter 14 (Catelyn II):
&gt;Slender, at least.

ASOS - Chapter 20 (Catelyn III):
&gt;“Jeyne, though he may not know it yet himself. A king must have an heir.” 

&gt;The girl smiled at that. “My mother says the same. She makes a posset for me, I think. We . . . we try most every day, my lady. Sometimes twice or more.” The girl blushed very prettily. “I’ll be with child soon, I promise. I pray to our Mother Above, every night.”

&gt;...

&gt;...the sound of the rain on the roof mingled with her father’s breathing, which might be more important.

ASOS - Chapter 45 (Catelyn V):
&gt;“I[Robb] had hoped to leave Jeyne with child . . . we tried often enough

&gt;“It does not always happen the first time.” Though it did with you. “Nor even the hundredth. You are very young.”

AFFC - Chapter 44 (Jaime VII):
&gt;Jeyne Westerling had been Robb Stark’s queen

&gt;...

&gt;“Best keep some archers near Lord Westerling’s daughter as well.” 

&gt;Ser Forley seemed taken aback. “Gawen’s girl? She’s—” 

&gt;“—the Young Wolf’s widow, my lord. She will be watched.”

**EDIT**: ~~With the siege occurring well over a year from when Robb and Jeyne last were together.  It must mean that Jeyne had given birth by the time of siege and was not pregnant.~~  Based on [this timeline](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/31411-global-timeline/) it appears the Siege of Riverrun ended about five months after the Red Wedding,,False,self,t5_2r2o9,1350481021.0,,True

Throughout the whole series, to one looking for vengeance.Now instead of helping smallfolk, the sole purpose of the BwB seems to be the systematic killing of everyone related to the Red Wedding. 

Now why is this post titled the Red Wedding 2.0. Well first of all we know that there is going to be a wedding in Riverrun. Daven Lannister and some Frey girl are going to get married to strengthen the alliance between these two families. We know that many (not all) Freys and Lannisters will attend the wedding. Now you may think just because there's a wedding doesn't mean it will immediately end in tragedy. Sure, ""Arya""s wedding,etc. but there have been a few bloodless, albeit miserable wedding experiences. Well, wouldn't it make sense that the Brotherhood without Banners is looking to give the Freys and the Lannisters a taste of their own medicine.

We know for the nonce that Tom O' Sevens is in Riverrun acting as a bard. What the hell is he doing there? Did he quit the brotherhood? We are given absolutely no explanation to why he's there, especially Riverrun. It is no secret that the north and the Riverlands hate the Lannisters and the Freys. So it isn't crazy to believe that some of the smallfolk or the soldiers who were pardoned to turn on the Freys. However, what I believe to be the greatest piece of evidence is the UnCat is leading the BwB. She is a character that is completely bent on revenge and will do anything to get it. Hell, she should know that Arya and Sansa are somewhere, alive, and instead she's off killing every visible Frey. So I don't think that Tom O' Sevens being in Riverrun is a coincidence. We also know that the BwB is very close to Riverrun. We see how one of the Freys (I forget his name, there are too fucking many of them) gets murrdered when heading to the Twins, yet I believe,,False

1375926837.0,1jxe7r,"(Spoilers All) ""Tywin's Legacy Revisited""",Targareyn87,182,32,96," I just recently delved into this subreddit and missed the recent post about Tywin being overrated. As my sigil/flair suggests, through any objectionable view Tywin Lannister wielded power as well as any character in the entire series. I ask you to bear with me because this post is going to be lengthy

&gt; Tywin's destruction of House Reyne and Tarbeck wasn't that impressive

When Lord Tywin was a child/teenager the ineptitude of his father's rule in the Westernlands left House Lannister nearly in ruin to the point that the Lannisters were openly mocked. The two most powerful vassals in the West, or the Tyrells dealing with House Hightower and Redwyne simultaneously. Success was far from assured. Despite all of this, Tywin decided to take control of the issue as a *teenager* who had never held military command beforehand. Quoting the Wiki directly, ""It is said that he exercised his command brilliantly and efficiently"". The final result was the complete **annihilation** of the two most powerful vassals in the West that resulted in the *Rains of Castamere.* A song that sends a warning to any who dare cross the power of House Lannister. From that point forward he took the remnants of his disgraced house and over several decades restored it to become the most wealthy, powerful, and feared house in the entire realm. 

Now I would like to address the issue which many Tywin detractors seem to gloss over

&gt; Tywin proved himself a brilliant administrator and held the post for twenty years of peace and prosperity. Some people joked it was he and not the king who really ruled the land. 

To put this into perspective you need only look at every single hand that ruled after Twyin. Most of them were disgraced and eventually killed. If anything

&gt; Tywin's reputation came from acts of Brutality

**Agreed** but I think this criticism is given from a negative bias towards Tywin and the Lannisters in general. However, House Farmen, all Tywin had to do was send a singer to play the Rains of Castamere. House Farmen never again made so much as a peep in objection to Tywin. Tywin also sent his dog, Gregor Clegane, to dispose of the royal family when he sacked King's Landing. The result of that order was nothing short of horrific. Was this simply a brutal and unnecessary order? No, I have no doubt that Tywin had the foresight and cunning to realize that if ANY of the Targareyns were spared then they would serve as a threat to the throne. The only principal actor in the Usurper's War who objected to this order was Ned. Ironically, it is the Stark's devotion to honor and integrity that largely led to the ruin of Winterfell. 

&gt; Tywin was a coward and hid out during the Usurper's War

This criticism is again based on subjective opinion that ignores the facts. Tywin ignored Aerys' plea to join the forces supporting the crown because at this point in time he hated Aerys probably as much as most of the rebels. Aerys stole Tywin's heir, it is precisely because Jaime was a member of the Kingsguard that Tywin would not combine his forces with that of the rebels. As stated in the Wiki, the moment Jaime became a member of the Kingsguard Tywin understood that Aerys was making Jaime a hostage. The only time he was willing to act was when the war was decided and his son, and heir, would be safe. 

&gt; Tywin's friends are also plotting against him due to his ruthlessness, and the Tyrells. They are constantly plotting against him

This was the criticism that frustrated me the most about the other post. Since when is Littlefinger, or ANYONE outside of the Westernlands considered Tywin's friends? The other post stated that these forces plotting against him would be the downfall of his house. The real reason these forces will plot against House Lannister is for one reason and one reason alone, **power**. Power is a finite quantity, and due almost exclusively to Tywin's skill the Lannisters had amassed an obscene amount of it. If we know anything about Littlefinger, the Tyrells (mainly Mace), or most of the houses in the realm is that they desire more power. The only way to do that is to take it from those who have it, the Lannisters. 

Now I would like to address the criticisms levied against Tywin that were completely valid. They are these three:

* Fortuitous elimination of Renly
* Treatment of Tyrion
* Failure's of his command during the War of Five Kings

First of all,000 men. However, Renly's untimely demise benefited *everyone* else in the war, not just Tywin. Renly had every intention of marching on the North if Robb didn't yield to his claim.

Tywin's biggest failure as a commander also occurs during the War of the Five Kings. To be fair, Tywin subsequently made several miscalculations, and even more grievously underestimated the military command of Robb Stark. As has been analyzed at length Robb proved himself to be an exceptional military tactician. From the Battle of the Whispering Wood, to his sacking of the West to set up a trap for Tywin. Ironically, it was the successful campaign of Edmure that caused Tywin to march South and ruin Robb's plan. Robb's ultimate failure lied in his inability to see the consequences of his actions longterm. This is where many people say Tywin got lucky to survive the war. I would posit to you that luck had **nothing** to do with it. Robb's biggest mistakes were marrying Jeyne, which lost him the Freys, and beheading Rickard Karstark. An effective leader/commander knows how to keep his allies happy and *loyal*. If Tywin switched shoes with Robb would he have married a woman that would cost him the Twins? Would he have beheaded one of his most powerful vassal lords whom was essential to him winning the war? The answer to those questions is unequivocally no. Robb Stark's failure seemed inevitable because, he lacks the political savvy and cunning to lead. Tywin then basically ended the rebellion from the North with his pen from King's Landing. Not only did he orchestrate the Red Wedding

Tywin's biggest weakness in my opinion is his attitude towards Tyrion. By all accounts Tywin was madly in love

&gt; Tyrion is Tywin's son

I believe Tywin always saw himself in Tyrion, it was on Tywin's order that Tyrion was named Hand and sent to King's Landing to restore order during the war. That in and of itself is proof that Tywin trusted Tyrion's judgment. His greatest weakness however is that he could never acknowledge the genius of his youngest son, if he had then the legacy he created may have survived his death. 

Is Tywin a Demi-God that some present him to be? HELL NO. Is Tywin perfect in his judgment? Absolutely not. However

Tywin inherited a House in ruins and raised it to become the wealthiest and most powerful house in the Seven Kingdoms. He successfully married his family into the blood royal. Then through a bloody civil war that cost his House dearly

In the DVD commentary both O'Malley and Wright state that they played off of each other and the book version actually changed because O'Malley borrowed from the film screen play (I don't have a source link for this, watch it yourself).  Will we get to the point that HBO's AGOT needs to begin work on the final season before the final ASOIAF book is realease?  At the current pace, yes, and hopefully some arrangement can be made to benifit both the book and the show.

I think that Martin taking his time between releases benefits the books but will ultimately hurt the screen adaptation, but I think it is more likely that a Herbert/Anderson pair is more likely that will give us fluff to close out the series.

I would wager that the map is highly inaccurate.  To look for proof I would be interested to find references to the amount of time it took to get from any place to any other place, how long does that take compared to say Sunspear to Tyrosh.  Obviously there are some islands in the way and who is to guess about the currents, but if GRRM wanted to hint at certain inaccuracies this would be a way to do it.

For instance

What I'm currently having a problem with are the names of three areas:  The Land of Always Winter

We know the seasons on 'Planetos' are to some extent due to magic.  I know GRRM has said something to the effect of 'it's a fantasy novel' the answer probably isn't going to be some complex solar system situation.  I still think

Let's assume you can sail West from Westeros and you would eventually arrive on the East coast of Essos.  So you would travel over the Sunset Sea (yes I know the sun sets in the West) and arrive in the Shadowlands.  

I grew up in a place that felt like it was always winter and suffered from a lack of sunlight

I don't believe the distance between Asshai and the LoAW is very close if this is the case.  All of the land that is on the general latitude of Asshai/Summer Islands is very tropical in nature.  Sothoryos is supposed to be some plague ridden jungle with a bunch of ruined cities and apparently no one lives there anymore.  That whole region doesn't sound like it's very close to a land or residence of beings who make it always cold.

GRRM has said that Planetos is bigger than Earth, then I think we have one of two possible scenarios:

1.  The southern portion of the map is

2.  The reason that so little is known

So why the huge discrepancy in season lengths and in world temperatures?  There are some clues in the Red Waste and Dothraki sea I believe.  There is mention that the Red Waste has been growing and swallowing up cities and that the Dothraki sea is turning brown and that the grasses are shrinking.  Perhaps the cause of this (and it has been going on for sometime in the case of the Red Waste) is related to the return of a strong winter in Westeros.  The focus is always on winter and it's affects

Not sure how I feel about this idea but I'll go ahead and throw it out, mayhaps the Great Other is some tangible entity or force, which when it moves about the LofAW it takes winter with it, allowing the Others to move in a certain 'radius' of the Great Other?  For you Starcraft players the Great Other could be basically laying some creep for the Others to move on.  If the Great Other does exist in some tangible form, and it's truly great, maybe you need a 700ft magical wall to keep the damn thing out of Westeros.

On the other side, pushing each other back and then losing ground, causing the seasons to fluctuate.  If R'hollor is real it could mean it is losing in some sense and requires the use of humans (akin to Greek mythology) to fight back.  Thus the return of humans ability to use magic.  It sounds weird but if the Great Other is making use of dead human bodies then it too, for whatever reason despite how powerful it is, needs the assistance of human form to exert his will.

For me this brings up a whole host of other questions.  Where do the Children of the Forest fit in?  Why, or what is the actual story behind the Second Moon myth?  I don't believe that dragons are actually from the Moon, but I assume there is something more to that story.  What makes the shadow lands so shadowy?  Literal lack of light?  Smoking embers?  Could an eclipse be the shadow Quaithe refers to?  How does the Doom of Valyria fit in?  What kicked off the Winter and how much did it have to do with humans?  

It's late and I could keep rambling on.  I'll probably edit and add more in the morning

Basically, I'll take a good look at the data and make a post with some results!

Thanks for taking the time to participate!

EDIT: thanks for the suggestions.  A couple points and updates

1) This survey has nothing to do with an endorsement of the theory.  It doesn't matter if you believe in R+L=J or not
