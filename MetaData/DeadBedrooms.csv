1360286832.0,183pmg,Things I've learned from 1 year on r/deadbedrooms,marriedscoundrel,198,31,39,"After a year on this sub and reading everyone's else posts as well as my own situation

* Either your partner wants to have sex or they don't. That's a gross over-simplification but it's the bottom line. Don't believe excuses like ""If I wasn't so tired from working all day..."" People generally find a way to do the things they want to do. Don't focus your efforts into fixing ""If it wasn't for X we could have more sex..."" because X isn't really the problem.

* It's important to find out what priority (if any) your partner places on sex. Being LL is one thing, it has to be ""earned"", it's a special act, and they'd be outraged if you had sex with anyone else for whatever the reason, but when it comes to the two of you it's just not that important.

* The LL partner has to want to change. This means that they recognize there is a problem and they're willing to take steps to fixing it. For most of us, loving, and supportive partners - their only consequence for not changing is to have to deal with ""the talk"" every few months, which they can get out of by making empty promises, shutting down, or getting angry/defensive. We have to be willing to give them real incentive to change, even if that includes separation/divorce.

* Anti-depressants and birth control can kill a healthy libido. If your partner is on meds and experiencing a reduced libido you should consult with your doctor. There are many other hormonal factors that can wreck a person's desire to have sex.

* If you discover that you and your partner are sexually incompatible and there's nothing tying you down you should be willing to leave. Sexual incompatibility is a more than valid reason to end a relationship. It's nothing you should feel ashamed about. Even if the relationship is perfect otherwise this one thing is enough to wreck the harmony. If you aren't sexually compatible but leaving isn't really an option then you should be willing to consider more unorthodox solutions.

* Your partner's decreased libido isn't necessarily your fault. Don't take it so hard. No matter what your current condition is there's probably some one out there who'd be into you. That having been said physical appearance and behavorial changes can turn people off. If you aren't happy with who you are then take steps to fix things. 

* On the flipside

* When dating there is a subtle preparation aspect to sex. When you meet up there's an unspoken expectation of sex

* For most HL partners we're not just looking for a quick orgasm with a person. We want the intimacy, or at least not as frequently. So simply saying ""give me more sex!"" isn't a solution. The problem is that we want our partners to desire us more often.

 Maybe not so dead as some of those in here
 
 It started as many deaths do, checking emails, flipping laundry and working out bills.
 
 It was not my fault. It was not hers. Life simply changed. When we got together, getting a money order for rent. We fucked like rabbits and enjoyed it. We laid naked in bed until late in the afternoon if we wanted to, and we wanted to often. 
 
 Now, our to-do list must be prioritized and divvied up between us so that we even had a chance of fitting in going to the kid's friends' birthday party, getting a new AC filter from Home Depot, fixing that downspout that keeps popping a seam every time it rains, making sure we get to the farmers market for the local honey that keeps our daughter's allergies at bay, and still try to leave time for the dishes, laundry and detritus that accumulates as if with a mind of it's own.
 
 We were tired. No, like a that thingamajig that sits in the junk drawer in the kitchen.
 
 We knew we were supposed to hang on to it
 
 Neither of us felt that the other was doing their part
 
 It had to stop. I wasn't happy
 
 So I came up with a plan. A daring
 
 I was going to become a superhuman cleaning machine. I would push my limits of domestic ability. When I came home tired, open a diet coke and watch the antics of Paul and Jaime Buchman, I would resist.
 
 I did dishes, swept, mopped, vacuumed, cleaned mirrors, scrubbed toilets. All with the reckless abandon of a crazy person. I'd listen to entire albums in my headphones while I put armies of cleaning crews to shame. 
 
 I'd bring her her tablet and a glass of wine and make sure she relaxed. Her smile was the reward. I wasn't looking for sex
 
 I got it.

 Soon, and I saw her appreciation. Appreciation turned to affection, affection turned to attraction and before I knew it, we were spending time together.
 
 Not just in the same room, and we craved each other.

There's a story, the only allowable outcome is ORBIT.  And the only two ways to get out of orbit are (A) achieve escape velocity or (B) crash and fucking burn.

If you've been at this six months, escape velocity is a lot easier than you think it is.  TRUST ME, I've been at this almost two decades.  But s/he loves me, s/he gets me, s/he is perfect in every other way - yeah, yeah, yeah, done that.  At 17 years with no kids and no mortgage it has taken me two years to build enough momentum just to google divorce lawyers.  Add kids and a mortgage?  I get why you stay.  And seriously

So, enough.  Pretty enough, sexy enough, smarty enough, funny enough.  You know what I am after all these years of trying to be enough?  AWESOME.  I'M FUCKING AWESOME.  And you know what else?

It was never enough.

Because I was never the problem.  Unfortunately

Every moment that I am not doing something, I was in my 20's the last time I was on a date.  Since then Girls Went Wild and 14 year old girls in Alabama gave up anal to keep their virginity.  I CAN'T COMPETE ON THIS LEVEL.  I don't even know if I remember how to kiss.

(BRB

The toll it takes on your self-esteem IS why you stay.   A few months ago I did something on reddit I had never done before: I messaged one of you.  Our conversation was about this fear we shared, and I don't.  Who the fuck thinks like that?  Broken people, that's who.

A dead bedroom is the most vicious cycle of all.  The reason you share your bedroom with someone is because they are your significant other, would that work for you?  Him: Um, ok.  And then Thursday would roll around, 9PM, 10PM, 11PM.  Like maybe if he waited long enough I'd give up and go to sleep.  Then he started asking for rain checks.  Then I stopped making appointments.

Best. Thing. I. EVER. Did.

I mean, but WOW, did it ever wipe a bunch of stress out of my life.  I didn't have to work up the nerve to make the appointment, I didn't have to spend X days wondering if he'd remember the appointment, I didn't have to spend the entire day of wondering how he'd weasel out of the appointment - it was awesome, and the only thing I had to do to achieve such amazing awesomeness was GIVE UP SEX.

Broken.

Compromise becomes surrender.  Hope becomes cope.  This is your life and you don't know how to stop it, entire weeks, months slip by and there you are in your broken little rut thinking this will never change and you know this to be true because in all these years nothing ever has.  Every promise a lie.  Every single one.

So you pour yourself a drink, and try not to cry while you masturbate.

So, awful, passionless.  Done.

Escape Velocity.  I need momentum.  Or a kick in the ass.  Or for someone to throw me off this fucking cliff before I waste another decade contemplating the leap.

It will never be emotionally satisfying because you will always know that it is a chore for them; just something that has to be done
     
 I have been married for 20 years to a man who has little to no sexual attraction towards me. On the surface, I drive a new car, our kids are happy and well adjusted. My husband is successful, thoughtful and a great father. He is aging well and has a great body (he works out daily). I also look pretty good for my age, and often catch men looking at me. I truly love him, and I am sure that he loves me. Our friends and family think we are a great couple. But every morning I wake up with tears in my eyes. 
  
My husband has always had very little interest in me as a woman, with little foreplay, and If I come once we are done. It has always been this way. When we were dating, I thought it was because of his religious upbringing (even though he was no longer religious)- I thought that subconsciously he might have been put off by the fact that we were 'sinning' and that it would improve after marriage. Nope. I've talked, discussed and begged. Nope.  I tried sexy lingerie, I worked out like a fiend, I tried romantic dinners and seduction, etc. etc.. Nope.  
  
So here I am after 20 years, living with a man who treats me like his favorite sister. I am waiting 5 more years for the kids to get a little older, then I am out. I would leave now, but that would involve selling our house and moving our kids to a crappy school district, which I am not willing to do. I figure I have put up with it for 20 years, what's another 5? I wish I had known in the beginning what I know now.

TL;DR: RUN! If they don't want you now

We were both 30, but neither of us acknowledged it. Basically, I would constantly pressure her for sex, until it became an obligation for her, something unpleasant. She avoided it more and more. And the more she avoided it, the more I wanted it. What's more, I had a porn habit that drove me to ever more extreme stimulation. By the time we hit rock bottom, it had to be extreme in some way. We'd go to fetish parties, we had an incredible

At this point we had a crisis in our marriage that made us re-examine whether we wanted to be together at all. I'll be honest, it would have to be this woman. We are just extremely compatible in so many ways, it was worth fighting through the shit we had always ignored. 

I think one of the hardest parts of a DB is that the focus is on the sex. Maybe that's a typical male focus, but instead of crazy fetish sex to try and fill our needs, there was just no sex, ever. The crazy sex filled life I'd had before was a lie we made ourselves, to try feel better about our dead relationship. The DB was actually an improvement in a big way - at least we were being honest.

So we started into couples therapy

So here are the key ""ahas"" for me that got us out of this terrible situation.

* **A DB is a symptom of a dead relationship**. You can be a nice team, you have to save your relationship first.

* **Recognise your sexual scripts**. We had the same sexual ""script"" that we would play out over and over again. It boils down to me asking, until it happens on an emotional level even without words. So I would initiate kissing and cuddling, and she would read that as a sexual advance. Then she would push me away as a way of saying 'no', and I would pout. That embedded script starts to appear everywhere, and it becomes a wedge between you. What kind of a relationship can you have if you can't hold each other? What kind of a relationship can you have if every romantic overture reads as aggressive pressure? The answer is, none. 

It's worth noting that this script can happen regardless of relative libidos. I really like grapes. My wife wakes me up in the morning with grapes in bed, that's fine. She calls me at work to ask if I want some grapes, and I'm starting to get sick of it. By the time dinner rolls around, every second comment is a joke about grapes, or an offer of grapes, and I'm just fucking sick of it. That night, THE LAST FUCKING THING I WANT IS ANOTHER FUCKING GRAPE. And I *really* like grapes! This is exactly the way the sexual script built up between us

* **Once you recognise your sexual scripts, but to your relationship as a whole. Our therapist was very helpful here, but the biggest breakthrough outside of the therapy room was the Masters and Johnson [Sex Ban](http://www.thedirtynormal.com/2010/07/15/real-pink-viagra-3-stop-having-sex/). We explicitly agreed not to have sex for an indefinite period of time. With that agreement in place, we could directly attack the awful script (that dirtynormal calls the ""chasing dynamic""). I would actually say to her ""it's ok, I'm not initiating or expecting anything. I just want to hold you for a bit."" or ""I just want to make out for a bit."" Gradually, over the course of months, the wall came down. You know the wall I'm talking about - the wall that comes up the moment your partner senses that maybe you might maybe potentially be thinking about wanting to have sex. The wall that shuts them off emotionally and physically, when you both KNOW that no one is having sex

* **Get your chemistry back**. Once you've broken the script, go out and flirt together. Be cuddly in public. This takes a long time to get back, but it's wonderful when it's there. 

  * The free site marriagebuilders.com is EXCELLENT for this. There are tons of fantastic articles about building your relationship, where you can share an experience and focus on each other. Just go and read the articles, it's great stuff for getting your chemistry back.

 * Take a dance class together. I hated dancing. I was bad at it, and hobbies to share, it was a pretty easy one to take up. Holy shit, guys, I can't recommend this strongly enough. Ballroom dance is about sexual chemistry and connection. For an hour or two a week, you go somewhere and have someone guide you to build connection and chemistry and spark. You have romantic/sexy music, you make sex movements with your body, holy fuck.

 * Do the Male Action Plan thing from Married Man Sex Life. It doesn't solve everything on its own

 * Read No More Mister Nice Guy. It's one thing to break the script of sexual ""chasing"", an emotional hose on her. I had no idea. This was extraordinary for me.

 * Take control of your own sexual needs, and enjoy that. It helps keep you from being a sexual dependent. Oddly enough, I'm finding that I can ask for sex without being a dependent. Still working this one out, though. :)

 * Take up a new hobby or two. Your partner can join you if they like, so you aren't always turning to your partner for that validation. 

 * Do the /r/pornfree thing. Masturbate as much as you like, and a huge change in your attitudes and desires about sex. This will help you get back to a healthy sexual mindset.

 * Do the 5 love languages thing. There's a similar set of exercises on marriagebuilders.com which is also good. Figure out how to talk frankly and dispassionately about your own needs, 2-3x/week. This, from the woman who had turned me down at every turn for 7 years! It blew me away. The reality is that she had a perfectly fine libido... I WAS JUST TURNING HER OFF. 

That's basically it. After just under 2 years, healthier person than I think I have ever been. I'm learning not to be a dependent, and I'm overcoming the patterns of people-pleasing which I've had since I was a child. I own my own sexual needs, and they do not define me. I'm learning to actually express the things I want, rather than constantly focusing on giving someone else pleasure so they validate me.

And it feels good, I stopped. At this point I'm trying to focus on the chemistry and let the sex grow organically.

What happened - I realized I would not be able to live with myself if I was sitting in the day room of the retirement home, use video games to calm my anger each night as I drank until I was ready to fall asleep on the couch (never in bed with my wife - I'd transition to the bed about 2am or sometimes as late as 4am, depending on how much I'd drank). I fulfilled my responsibilities as a dad as sincerely as I could, and my responsibilities as a husband as cordially as I could.

I never got angry or upset to her about our sexlife (though I was definitely plenty angry)

One day in April or May of this year, decades, leaving their spouses feeling angry and duped, one child quoted along the lines of ""that bastard let my mom think she was the problem all these years, stealing from her whatever chance she had of a fulfilling sex life because he was too much of a coward to live up to who he was."" What struck me about it was the sense of how legitimate it was to want a sex life. My fapping habit (daily, have I mentioned that) had led me to /r/gonewild, and from there I found /r/deadbedrooms and I got some sense for how common my situation was and how real it could be that it would never get better.

I found http://5lovelanguages.com

I thought about what she'd told me she wanted from me in our relationship - to feel connected.

I thought about what I wanted from our relationship

She had just finished the reporting for the end of the school year, I was home on a vacation day to help with something, no idea what in retrospect, and I just told her I wanted to talk. I honestly wish I remember more of what I said and how I said it, but the basic idea was that I said, ""I know you want to be connected emotionally, and I do to. And I know that you've told me that you don't feel a desire for a physical connection until you already feel the emotional connection. For me it works in the reverse - I don't feel a desire for the emotional connection until I've already made the physical connection. It's like a circle - if I'm making the emotional connection with you, and so I make the emotional connection with you, but, back rubs

But I got through to her, or even thought of it myself, as an 'exchange' or a bargin. It was me simply showing my love for her, doing the right thing for the exhausted mother of my children. And I made a point to take up chores that could only be for her. I don't drink coffee, but soon I was the only one making it so that first thing in the morning, she'd be drinking the evidence of my commitment to her. I started making the bed every morning, something I'd never done, bought new clothes

And it went on like that day after day, but that would die away if there wasn't more to it. I flirted, I told her how I would respect her boundaries (long ago I'd whine for sex while she was on her period - she didn't want to do it, I'd pressure her, she would eventually, and that is one of the many steps that lead to a dead bed room...) and I made sure to address any issue that could come between us. Might she, a 40 year old woman who has delivered 3 children and is quite busy raising them have some body image issues? Well, she might. So, but you compliment her. You don't say ""nice tits"" you say ""sweetie

And so you start seducing her and you never stop. You decide that if you aren't going outside your comfort zone a bit, about how you (fulfilling her fantasy) wait day after day to touch her body, how much your love for her is anchored by her commitment to her children. And you get racy, but you know not to get too racy - because you know her! Everything you do says, ""you know I love you because I know you so well.""

I think of a sex life as almost like a child - it has the DNA of both partners, I tried some dirty talk (mild stuff) I tried some of the 'what women want' from http://thedirtynormal.com, I explained that if she didn't want me to go down on her again, that was ok, that was her boundary, but that I want to please her and I like to do it, and I just remember how good she used to taste and if I could taste her again it would mean so much to me.

I took things slow. So  S  L     O      W       OMG, how insulting is that, right? Horrible.

There were bad days, but I tried so hard to not just withdraw to not let her withdraw, to be honest about what I want, to respect that my needs were legitimate, that her fear was legitimate, that I cared about her, not about sex. And then she realized she could trust me. I wanted her, but I was in control

One thing I think I learned was that a large part of my high sex drive was feeling insecure in the relationship. If I felt a little panicky that maybe she wasn't happy with me (low self-esteem issues) I wanted to get her in bed to reassure myself that we were 'OK'. I told her that, but she understood a little better what sex meant to me, why it was good for her too.

And so on it went, she and I are so much happier. And honestly, I don't really get off on porn now, just not very interesting, and fapping is similarly not very tempting (but every now and then habit seems to say 'do it!'). I can goes days without getting off - because it isn't about getting off, it is about getting close. I've learned so much about her, about how much security matters to her. What I used to think was a quirk or habit (locking the car doors NO MATTER WHAT) I now understood - she's just got a little anxiety. Don't criticise her for it

I thought I would just be happy to get off more often

Sorry for the stream of consciousness rambling

I felt like I really wanted to post with some clues

A few other notes, fear of something (anger, body image, criticism/performance anxiety, escalating demands - from more frequent sex to more kinky sex, etc). Think of each of these things and don't just say 'not this one, not that one, 'here's how I can address this one if it is a problem

In the end

Well

The sincerest condolences and best of luck to everyone here with this problem

Take a wild guess. I tell you ""Just some dust""

I drove 2 hours in the dark and fog tonight to visit you because you said you missed me. Silly me to expect sex, you're tired. What good will come from another talk? I'll tell you I feel disgusting and you'll call me beautiful. I'll cry that I feel unwanted and unworthy, and you'll say everything I want to hear. Well, that's not enough for me. Just kiss me. Kiss me and tell me that you want me so bad, but it'll have to wait to the morning or this afternoon because you've had a long day. I'd be totally content with that. 
But this...this partnership is more like an awkward friendship. One sided, no.  ""I'm too tired, dammit!"" Aren't we all. I'm tired of waiting all night for you. I'm tired of the sinking feeling of another night and another opportunity washed down the drain. I'm tired of the pointless prepping too. I always shower with my special bath gel and even shave in anticipation that you'll even touch my legs or my hips. But you won't. A lot of wasted Gillette shave gel, and a wasted day at that. 

The funny thing is you seem to know what I want. You ask me with a shaky voice ""is everything alright?""  You damn well know it's not. This is the only alone time and opportunity for intimacy for the next month and you are keen on brushing right past it. You know that I want you. You know I think you're the sexiest man I've ever seen. Writing that makes my heart beat a little differently. You're so beautiful to me. Alluring

You just told me you loved me. You said you were so grateful I drove 100 miles at 10 pm just to be with you. You run my back...stop it. Stop touching me. You ask me why I don't want to cuddle. I smile and just say I'm too warm. But it's because I can't stand your touch. Everything is a tease to me. I want the touches and grazes and pinches. But I also want the grabbing and holding and rubbing. I want it all. I want you.  But I can't have you...I only get 50%. This isn't clothes shopping

I went out of town to hang out with some friends and get my mind off the pending divorce which I was still a little uneasy about.  I spent the day with a small group including someone I had met once before who was going through a divorce herself.  We hit it off pretty well and spent most of the day a little separate from the rest of the group sharing our stories, etc.  We got a little tipsy, started really flirting, and then she grabbed me and started kissing me with such intensity right there in public.  She nervously asked if I would stay with her that night which I agreed to.

I won't get into too many details, moaning and calling out my name.  I've only once had a woman who was that into me, and I've never had sex that intense.  After years of DB, I would have thought it was impossible for a woman to be more into me than I was into her, but she clearly was and it felt incredible.

When I left her place the next morning, women wanted me, they REALLY wanted me.  My heart is racing right now just recalling it all and I've been experiencing feelings that I had almost forgotten I'd ever had.

Before this experience, I could never go back.  There is so much life out there to experience, so many feelings and emotions and intensities.  I've never been so excited for what's to come.  I also have been able to forgive my wife.  The anger and resentment just vanished.  I've moved on. I don't need her physically, and I no longer desire her for the half-hearted sex we rarely had.  I think we'll be able to be civil throughout the whole process and probably even stay friends.  Lifting the pressure of a DB changes everything.

I want to wish a sincere Thank You to everyone in this community.  Whether I was asking for advice, this place was incredibly supportive.  You guys (and gals) helped me get through some tough times, as well as kick my ass into gear about doing something to fix my life.

Thank you everyone!

Then life happens.  Jobs, family...it doesn't really matter what it was, but things changed.  Attitudes, feelings, ideas, priorities on both parts, yours and theirs. Intimacy remains important, only to you.


Suddenly what was once the simplest, to a few times a month, to a few times every other month, to a few times every six months, to a few times a year.  The few times your needs are met, it's with great unpleasantness.  There's no passion, no love, and that they're just wishing for it to be over as soon as possible.  Now you feel worse and guilty instead of better.
Then the questions begin...


I thought we were on the same page?


Don't you like me anymore?


Am I ugly now?  Am I not attractive?


Is there someone else? Am I bad in bed?


You need to feel close to have sex? You didn't before.


I ask for it too much?  I don't ask for it enough?


No matter what it is, that you don't even need to ask any more.


And then the excuses...


You have a headache again?


Another bad day at work?


Kids tired you out again?


Still depressed?


Still bothered by that thing?


Family bothering you again?


You believe their excuses, but don't remember how it feels.  You plan romantic dinners, dates, vacations, surprises, but nothing every happens.  Hours and sometimes weeks of planning and effort go down the drain in another failed attempt at trying to recapture what was once there. And again you feel absolutely crushed and devastated by the rejection.


Self doubt creeps in...


Maybe they're right.


Maybe it is me?


Maybe I have the problem


Maybe I'm some sort of sex maniac and I need help.


Maybe I'm not normal.


Then the ultimatum.  ""We need help or else!""  But they blame you and the entire world for not understanding their point of view.  Guilt trips run rampant as they cry foul and play the blame game to a tee.  ""I know things are bad now, only to have something happen turning hope into depression again.
""How much longer can I go on like this?"" You ask as you question your own endurance.  Passionless kisses


As empty as you are, no animosity of any kind.  Except your always sad and lonely, but do your best to never show it.  Thoughts of leaving happen on a regular basis, but you know there's absolutely no guarantee that things will be better anywhere else. You're not a cheater. You love your SO.  You just wish you could flip a switch, and have their libido match yours.  Masturbation becomes a band-aid solution to make it through the day/week/moth/year.  But it's never fulfilling, and usually make you feel lonelier by the time you drift back to reality. 


It's difficult to tell what day it is because they all run together now, look over at your SO, and the depression, resentment, anger, sadness and loneliness start all over again.  But you don't say a word, just get up and do your best to make it through one. more. day.

That time of the month when all the stars seem to magically align and you actually have a sex drive again. It only lasts about 8 hours so sometimes I do miss it and have to wait another month or two.

So your in the mood but rather than tell me like a normal human being you signal it instead in some really subtle way. Like laying face down and reading or taking slightly too long to get dressed once out of the shower.

So I initiate hoping that I don't have the signs wrong and you aren't going to scream at me how you aren't in the mood

So its foreplay time

Because apparently you tighten up so much after you orgasm that we can't possibly have sex. And if you do come then one of two things will happen. Either you will roll off and go to sleep or you will break out the coconut oil and give me a handjob with the most bored look possible on your face all the while talking about how great it is that you are doing this for me and making sure that ""I get mine""

Or maybe I don't go overboard on the foreplay and we actually get to have sex. Whoop de doo. 10-12 minutes of fun

Next night... New Moon... same again. Eclipse... ticked all the boxes too. I have to work away from home a lot - something I'd partially enjoyed before - and it was a new experience for us both to miss each other again - and the night I got back

Yesterday we went to the cinema - I was meant to be working from home, what would you do?! - and I'm not ashamed to admit I cried a fair bit - and afterwards, we had an hour before we had to collect the younger kids from school - so for the first time in years, we went home, and ran up the stairs...

We got together at least once a week and fooled around at her house late at night after her family went to sleep.  Frequency tapered off a bit over time, hold my hand and all that stuff.  Looking back

So eventually we got married.  The first time my wife and I had full-blown intercourse was weird and awkward, banging on doors and even jimmying door handles.)  From there on in, our relationship went into a definite tailspin, both in- and outside the bedroom.  But *especially* in the bedroom.  Once a month became once every other month, to 4-5 times a year... and then, nothing.  When my wife started to talk about having a child about 8 yrs ago, I was deliriously happy, and at least while we were trying to conceive I'd be getting laid regularly.  So there was a major uptick in our sex life for about a year

Ever since then, no affection whatsoever.  No hugs, no pecks on the cheek, no smiles, no kind words.  I mean, absolutely nothing, aside from the perfunctory ""Love, which under the circumstances is perfectly meaningless.  I would go to kiss her goodbye every morning

A few months ago, after a long pause, was ""You're a good father to [our son].""  Her position is that this is just how things are; and if I don't like it, well, there's always divorce.  My wife of 16 years said this to me matter-of-factly.  Now, divorce would be an option, if not for my son, I worry about what our divorce would do to him emotionally.  (He's 5.)

So, and our marriage is dead.  There are days I feel like I would die of a broken heart if not for our son.

You make promises. Tell me things I want to hear. We have good sex

You ask if I really am that busy with work, direct language. Somehow you don't understand. Even if I do get home early the best I can hope for are maybes and excuses.

I've told you I don't care if I come home and there's no dinner and the chores aren't done and I don't have any clean clothes to wear - if you were interested in me sexually or just wanted to give me a blowjob to improve my day I'd be the happiest man on Earth. I've told you this directly several times and somehow you just don't get it.

For my birthday I told you I didn't need that expensive wallet you were looking at in the store. All I wanted was a healthy sex life. If I could be granted one wish. I didn't need material items. Yet on my birthday I unwrapped that wallet

I'm sure you'd be willing to take one for the team and put out a few times a week. You've done it before. But that's not what I want at all. I want a partner who wants sex and enjoys it just as much as I do if not more. Is that asking for too much? I don't bother initiating because nothing you do or say gives off even the slightest impression you want sex

I'm sorry I'm not honoring the unspoken agreement I made with you. The one you'll never know about. I try not to expect sex from you. I really do. But this isn't the life I wanted. I told you this before marriage ever was on the table and you promised you were on the same page. And yet here we are. People tell me to do the ""honorable"" thing and just leave you. I can't do that. I can't just leave you and our family behind. Then I'd be a monster. So I have to keep living the lifestyle I do

I know you love me. You show me in your own ways. The ways you think people are supposed to show their love. I've told you that's all well and good

I told her we needed to get our relationship back, get sleeping together, etc.  We had started co -sleeping with our kids, and it ended up that I just slept on a matress in my son's room for years.  it wasnt easy to get the kids sleeping on their own, but we did it, but not give up our own relationship.  

It wasn't easy, dress well, etc.  Make sure you have the house in order.  I havent fixed everything in the house, but I jumped on one project and brought up ideas with my wife on how to fix other things, get more organized, etc.  The book said that talking to your wife wont fix anything though... and he is wrong.  Talking helped, but it wasn't simple.  

The real thing i realized is that even soemthing simple can be looked at differently by your partner.  I would try to flirt with my wife and be spontaneous, it seems that she just felt it was me pressuring her for sex.  Over the last 6 months, I just tried REALLY hard to listen to what she had to say, and talk about how I felt, and not try so much to just show her how I was right.  I would just explain to her that it seemed there was no way out of this problem.  how could I show her I was sexually interested in her, if she felt any time I made a pass at her that she would feel pressured to have sex.  I wonder if the problem was just that she felt obligated to have sex.  She has said that she had this problem with any relationship over time.  She would feel she had to have sex to keep a guy, and then lose interest.  I told her I knew how she felt.  The end of our sex life initially was when she got pregnant for our daughter.  By the time she got pregnant, as I felt I HAD to have sex when was ready, same sex life

so it seems the problem was that she felt she was required to have it

Once i got this idea, but she didnt, and I had still married her.  I explained at one point that it wasnt that I just wanted sex, I wanted BOTH halves to the relationship:  the Friend half of her, and the Lover half.  If I had only wanted the Lover half, I wouldnt have married someone who only had sex with me once a month.  This seemed to help, to help her realize that I wasnt just looking for sex.  Just the other night, I got talking about sex and then apologized, and that she should be happy that I still wanted sex with her so much.  I had been talking about an idea I had to just take a month and not have sex at all, that it was all for sex.  I did want to help her get in the mood

Anyway, having apparently succeeded in getting out of my dead bedroom, it would be this:

* you have to let them know you arent happy, it was due to lack of INTIMACY.  If she could be close to me, hugs, kisses, affection, but for some reason we could not ever have sex again, ever, to get her to realize it wasn't just getting an orgasm that i wanted
* Talk talk talk, and instead of dealing with that, i just withdrew from her, and it snowballed out of control.  
* Be ready to do whatever you can to correct whatever issue is causing the problem.  I might have gotten lucky to find out that my wife's big problem, but I would not give up.  I wouldnt push things every night, but I kept pushing over time.

1369495657.0,1f16bx,I (25F ML) and my husband (31M LL) have only had sex once. You read that right. Once.,MathematicalModel,85,15,329,"The back-story:
We met in university 5 years ago, and still is, amazing.

We kissed and touched to some degree, I didn't have penis-in-vagina sex but I had certainly had plenty of oral.  He hadn't dated before, however.  This should have been a bigger red flag, but I chalked it up to him being quiet and nerdy.  At the time, he certainly kissed me like he meant it.

The thing is, personally, but I was willing to respect his beliefs.  The rest of the relationship was perfect and he genuinely seemed like he wanted me.  We decided we wanted to get married, and before getting engaged we decided to do a pre-marital course in order to outline our expectations.  This included sexual expectations and we talked about this openly and extensively.  Honestly, our expectations before marriage were very similar.

So, and got married.  We fooled around for the first couple of weeks and I tried to initiate sex, but he avoided it.  Eventually, we tried having sex and he was so nervous he couldn't keep it up.  Whatever.  This shit happens.  Keep trying, though, right?  No.  He was so scared of disappointing me that he didn't want to try.  I tried making things low pressure, so he wasn't so nervous

Fuck, etc) and nothing made a difference.  I asked him to consider getting cialis or viagra or something, and this was like admitting he was a failure.  For all I knew, he had erectile dysfunction.  Again, whatever, this shit happens.  And if he had E.D., I'd try to make the best of it.  But something didn't seem right...  So I asked him about masturbation.

Yep.  He couldn't get it up in my presence but had no issue rubbing one out every day to kinky online stories.  I asked him about his fetishes, but this was pretty fucked up.  Anyway.  I felt like the masturbation was getting in the way of our theoretical sex life.  Like, apparently after fooling around, he would masturbate after I'd gone to bed, even though I was begging to have sex moments previous.  What the fuck.  We talked about this and he agreed to try to stop masturbating and to try to let me know we he was horny.  Cool.  Some progress.

However, I learned that if he wasn't going to masturbate he didn't want me to masturbate because he was jealous.  However, he wasn't offering to get me off.  I asked him to pleasure me on many occasions but he treated it like it was too much work, or that vaginas are too gross (for reference, I wash my vagina everyday with gynecological soap and keep my pubic hair trim and neat.  My vagina is so clean you could eat out of it, hahaha).  To this day I have gotten about 3 minutes of oral sex out of him.

Eventually, the cialis is largely unused in a cupboard.

I demanded we see a relationship counsellor.  He accused me of not trusting that he was trying to fix the situation.  To his horror, we were probably 4 months into the marriage and both still virgins.  He agreed to see a counsellor and we set up a meeting.  I think we got the shittiest marriage counsellor in existence.  First, she essentially told me ""Your relationship is otherwise great, right?  Then why are you complaining?  I have people that are being beaten by their spouses.  I think you need to get over yourself.""

I was fucking pissed.  Yeah, though.  He seemed happy with our relationship.  I demanded to see the counsellor again, because he didn't want to see a different one.  He figured I was just trying to get a second opinion until someone sided with me.  No.  I just thought she was a quack.  Well, we saw her again, and I went more into detail about our issues.  After finally listening, she concluded that our relationship is pretty fucked up and that my husband (and possibly I) should see a sex therapist.

I asked him to book an appointment to see a sex therapist.  I'm sure I could have booked it myself.  But I asked him to do it because I wanted to see if he was willing to actually put in the effort to do it.  Also

Fast forward a few sexless months later.  His aunt and uncle book us a couple nights in a hotel with room service wine/fruit as an early anniversary gift.  He feels obligated to have sex since that's what was implied by the gift.  We end up having some wine and finally doing the deed.  This was the one and only time we have had sex.  This was 9 months into the marriage.

Fast forward to 1 year 3 months into our marriage.  He has not booked an appointment with the sex therapist, I still may end up leaving you.  At this point, I feel the damage is done.  He is my best friend, but that's it.  He knew that booking the appointment was really important to me, but he put it off for almost a year.  One soul crushing year.

He cries.  But then he books the appointment.  He sees the sex therapist alone and comes back upset.  The therapist told him that he has serious problems and should join sexaholics anonymous for pornography addiction.  I support him in this, trying to deal with the damage that has been done.  He stops seeing the sex therapist.  I'm not sure when.  At this point, we are now about 1 year and 4 months into our marriage.  I want to die.  He thinks we will be together forever.

Fast forward a few more months.  I forget exactly what happend, but I feel trapped.  I have told my husband how I felt all along this journey.  I'm not the type of person who expects their significant other to read minds.  But somehow he still doesn't understand the gravity of the situation.

I tell my husband that I am trying to find a family/divorce lawyer in order to find out what my rights are.  He weeps.  I weep.  Horrifyingly

He tells me that he will do whatever he can in order to let me keep the house, agree to to give him another chance.  That was 1-2 months ago.

A tldr of my last post: Husband like to be dominated. Sex life turns around.

Funnily enough, but the quantity of sex has stayed extremely high and we are both incredibly satisfied and smug about it.

The resentment being totally gone and all the sexual desires being on the table means that even if we have to go 5 days without sex because of sick kids or late nights in work there are still moments of intimacy stolen throughout the day. 

I cannot emphasize how much resentment and non-communication kills a bedroom. I know how frustrating that sounds when you're the one trying to communicate

Ideally, you are sexually frustrated, but take a moment, right now, to appreciate your partner for everything else they bring to the table. 

Now you'll want to make a silent vow to your partner. You're going to do this, the resentment. Stop expecting sex from them. It's something they've told and shown you they're not capable of, so continuing to demand it from them only sets the both of you up for failure. Stop taking their rejection personally.

**Cole's notes backstory: 2.5 year relationship. Honeymoon stage sex life for 6 months, I stopped initiating at his request &amp; out of guilt, and sex stopped happening. G-rated physical affection remained but the lack of sex was a huge elephant in the room.**

I had to admit to myself that the *talks* weren't creating any change.  And while I wished that simple communication was the answer, (aside from ""I don't know"" and ""I don't want to talk about it."")  **In fact, the talks were only making things worse as I put pressure on him to change something he felt he had no control over and couldn't explain.** 

I started coming up with worst-case reasons in my head for all of this: Is he secretly gay? Pretty damn sure he isn't.  Does he have some strange fetish he doesn't want to reveal to me? I'd given him countless opportunities to voice such a thing. Is he depressed? His work situation isn't great, ever.**  

So I stopped worrying about the sex we weren't having. I stopped resenting him about *putting me through this* and shifted focus to my own happiness and how I could help him and myself. I stopped censoring myself too; before, I segued into conversation how smart, well-liked and charismatic he was.  And despite my reservations about our relationship due to our undesirable sex life, I talked about our future together.  **It was a two-part initiative: care more about his feelings by giving him confidence in himself and the relationship, and start going after what I want steadfastly, with less emotion and apprehension attached to it.** 

I used to shy away from initiating out of constant rejection and the assumption he didn't like sex.  But **I realized a lot of my ""initiating"" was painfully subtle, I grabbed him and I kissed him, and if he didn't kiss me back then, well that was shitty, but at least I had my answer instead of pining away, wanting to cry in bed for being too embarrassed to just touch my boyfriend. I would simply try again another night.

And then something just clicked, when previously we'd only ever had sex in the evening before going to bed. And while the routine was beginning to get predictable, I knew that if it didn't happen friday night, or saturday night, I *knew* it was gonna happen sunday morning. And every time it did happen I rewarded his efforts with more affection, more flirting, and more compliments; not because I was trying to train his brain but because it was sincere.  Bringing the sex back instantly healed the cracks in the relationship and bridged emotional gaps between us.  Our dead bedroom was a two-way street: my constant pushing about the issue and his refusal to extend an olive branch of sexy times in return.  **We were both lost in a downward spiral sparked by something I'm still not sure of. What I know is I was so afraid of rejection and what horrible reason he may have for his low libido, which only brought his self confidence lower.**  Neither of us what providing the other with what they needed.  I'll admit I wish we didn't have to pussy-foot around this for the majority of our relationship, neither party is left feeling like sex is a chore.

I don't really know how to sum this all up, and more so on what your partner needs/what they're missing. I'm of the opinion now that **if the sex life was there initially, and then disappeared, there's a piece of the puzzle that's missing, be it attraction, emotional well-being, or physical well-being/health.**  Sometimes you just gotta cut and run if you can't restore what used to be there. And other times you gotta figure out what that missing piece is

Stats: We're in our late 30's 
No kids (by choice) 
Had a dead bedroom for years
We both got VERY lazy and complacent
 
My wake-up call was when a bff of mine started cheating on her husband. She had been complaining since the birth of her 2nd son 2 years prior that her husband never touched her, and discussions) so she felt she had no options.  
 
That scared me because I could see myself going down that gradual slope. I thought about what I really wanted as a sex life, active kickass sex life. So I just started taking steps to make it happen. 
 
1.  I realized that I can't change other people
2.  My demons were: Minor abuse as a child (nutted up, got a good, healthy handle on things.) Low self-esteem (listened to The Psychology of Achievement and other motivational stuff, stepped up my game at work and home, stopped the negative self-talk, did things that gave me feelings of accomplishment.) And finally, a weird awkwardness about sex. I just realized that my husband was the person I love and trust most in the world. If I couldn't talk to my own sex partner about sex
3.  On the low self-esteem front - this was hard. Maybe the hardest part of this. But I had to give up the dream that surely next week I would wake up looking like a nineteen year-old supermodel, including skin and keeping my nails manicured, NOT for him, but because I felt way sexier. (No need to spend $, I do my nails myself) I bought a few nice outfits, I started wearing makeup every day. I kept my legs shaved daily no matter what (way easier to enjoy spontaneous boning if you're not worried about being hairy) And mostly, I just had to stop thinking about how I looked, and my negative thoughts were stopping me from having fun. 
4.  Invested in us. After one of our talks
5.  I started telling him exactly what I wanted him to do.  No more making him guess. I basically took responsibility for my own pleasure, and that was what I needed. We also try to make things are physically comfortable as possible, nobody will get naked if we're freezing our asses off. 

We're not perfect

1356642579.0,15jc6h,Per Request - Success Story - LL's Point of View,throwawaytitty,72,14,16,"
Let me start off by saying that our Dead Bedroom was a mild circumstance. We’ve been together for 3 years and have lived together for the majority. About half of that time frame contained amazing and consistent sex. Then suddenly

Me - 24 - Female - LL

“B” - 26 - Male - HL

During the good times of our relationship, like all relationships, the frequency of sex slowed. I suddenly found myself annoyed with things that never bothered me before. Our work schedules had changed and I thought that that was maybe the reason for my sudden loss in sex drive. Then the sex stopped on the weekends even when both of us had nothing better to do but screw each other’s brains out. I began making excuses in my head as to why these things were happening. It was very clear that *he* wanted sex but I could never get myself in the mood. I wanted to *want* sex, but unfortunately, that’s just not enough to get me wet. It should be said that now looking back at this point in time, I realize that I stopped initiating sex.

I thought maybe the stresses of my job were causing me to be too tired after hours to have sex. So what did I do? I changed jobs. I thought maybe my birth control was suppressing my libido so I tried a different pill. I wanted to believe that the problems were external forces rather than internal ones. Our relationship was perfect before and I just yearned for that giddy-butterflies-in-my-stomach feeling again. Unfortunately

B was clearly mentally drained of my excuses for not being in the mood. He suddenly started a routine of asking me for sex. He would say things like “Can we go eat dinner and then have sex?” or “Hey, I wanted to run the other way.

Ultimately

I was worn out from feeling pressure to have sex and I was worn from stressing over our relationship. I hated knowing that I wasn’t fulfilling all of B’s needs. We would have sex on occasion and for me it was simply just to get the deed done. He knew this and in the end

Now I know this may sound strange, but I just couldn’t.

It should be said that at this point I was not masturbating at all. It clearly wasn’t a lack of attraction for B

Now I don’t know what happened but I started paying attention to things that turned me off. I started paying attention to the things going on in my mind while I tried to watch porn. It seemed like I had these endless trains of thoughts going on the back of my mind completely unrelated to the situation happening right before my eyes -- whether it be in porn or B giving one last effort to initiate sex. I was stressed. My mind would not focus on anything. Whether it be stressing over a long day at work or how dirty the house was -- I just couldn’t let go. 

I compiled a list of the issues I had and B really helped me overcome them. 

Some of this may sound silly

- Try to help your SO relax. Cook them dinner or bring them something so they don’t have to worry about it. Try to help them calm their mind of any stresses they may have going on that day. Maybe they can't get in the mood to have sex because they are too busy worrying in the back of her mind about how dirty the house is or maybe their working out a problem she had at work that day in her head. Give them a gentle and short massage while they stand up doing something ordinary around the house. The trick is not making it seem like you're trying to coax them into sex right away. You don’t want them to feel pressured in any way by your actions.
- Start kissing again. I mean truly
- Start teasing again and regain the sexual tension. Play footsies under the table
- Don't fart or burp around them. I know you two may feel comfortable around each other but seriously, nail biting or any other peeves they may have.
- If you're living together, but as a woman, I love walking into a room after B just put on his cologne. It smells delicious!
- Shower them with compliments. As a girl

1367081631.0,1d81en,Resentment for my wife might be what finally murders our bedroom.,Imthebadguyasusual,63,7,57,"Long time reader first time poster.  Throwaway of course. 

My wife and I have been married for 6 years and together for 2 before that. 2 kids 4yo &amp; 5yo single income family so she can stay home and be the mother she so desperately wanted to be all her life.

When we first met she was around 200 pounds with quite severe self esteem issues. She had never had a healthy relationship and been pressured quite a bit by various guys who just saw her as an easy target including a few drunken ne nighters with close male friends who pulled the whole ""this was a bad idea and isn't going anywhere.. bit one more round before I leave is fine right?"" routine on her the next morning. 

She had never had an orgasm or been with anyone who even cared if she was enjoying it or not.  Not even close.  

The literal moment we met she knew I was the man she wanted to marry (her words) and she turned out to be right.  We got to know each other as friends through mutual acquaintances and eventually got together. She discovered she was multi-orgasmic on our first bedroom encounter and i discovered her total lack of self awareness or entitlement. Moved in. Got engaged. Got married. Fell pregnant on the honeymoon then sex basically stopped due to her pelvis being too tender after the first trimester.  We did coax a couple of ultra-slow and gentle rounds in the final week to try and bring on labor.  Worse than pity sex (sorry to be bitter or negative about that but it just made me feel like a neglected piece of meat she finally found a use for... Getting that baby out ASAP!)

So 3 months after bubs had arrived we did have sex again... And fell pregnant.  Again.

This time there was even LESS sexual contact. We tried twice and while she had multiple orgasms we had to stop before I could climax due to pain. However

Our sex life now is terrible. She has put on enough weight that i find her physically repulsive and seems to have no motivation to lose it (240-250 pounds?). It makes sex HARD regardless of who is on top. Something she was never even confident enough to do until about a year ago which i had to coax her into because getting on top of her was so.... unappealing that i couldn't keep an erection. Of course I didnt tell her that. Now her belly literally presses down against my stomach so hard that it makes me feel like I'm going to gag on my own stomach acid.  She hates giving head and is also utterly CRAP at it because it clearly disgusts her. The 5-6 times she has done it in our relationship I have been encouraging and patient and tried to help guide her but she doesn't even keep at it long because its ""too much effort"". 

She gets upset that we keep going through cycles of just being ""room mates"" or that she is afraid of rejection if she initiates.  Which usually entails being engulfed by sudden bad breath sloppy open mouthed attempts at kissing me for 10 seconds and then I'm supposed to be aroused and taking over so she can lay back and be ravished.  But these cycles are a symptom of us BOTH going through LL periods for various reasons.

I'm wall of text rambling here but I just..... Have no idea how to fix our problems. 

Self esteem. Communication. Attraction. Honesty. 

I don't mean to blow my own trumpet but I HAVE always been endlessly supportive and encouraging of her. I work 70 hour weeks and devote time to her and the kids at the expense of time to myself and at the exclusion of all personal hobbies.  I have sacrificed every luxury in my life to put her through study and establish her own business which she has done nothing with for the past year!  Despite her still talking about the things her ""business"" needs to be 100% what she envisions while she stays home and works maybe 4 hours a fortnight......

I basically don't WANT her most of the time now. I just eventually get so frustrated that I initiate and she never refuses because she always orgasms repeatedly. But then I feel dirty and neglected and resentful and unfulfilled because although I climax it's really an anti-climax. 

We currently average once a month which is how long it takes for me to get frustrated to the point where I do something about it.  I don't feel valued or important to her. I don't believe her when she says she loves me. 

We have had the talk. Three times now with no lasting effect. Her cellulite continues to spread and my needs continue to not register on her radar. But the worst part of it all is she is SO FUCKING UNHAPPY with her life and I know there is nothing more I can possibly do for her. The only person who can make her happy is her. 

I love her more today than I ever did

Sorry for the wall-of-vent. I'm just at a total loss and am not even expressing myself well.  I feel for all of you and your stories and wish our loved ones could know just how much we love them and how much we want them despite the hurt they inflict on us.

Here's how scheduling sex works for us: we pick a mutually agreed upon date and time to have sex

Now I know that this all sounds incredibly unromantic, we have yet to have an unpleasant experience with this system. Although we're rarely in the mood when the appointed time arrives, once we get started, we end up having a lot fun together. Thanks to our scheduled appointments, what would have been a normally sexless night turns out really quite pleasant for the both of us. 

One reason why this system works out so well for us is that it takes away the pressure and uncertainty surrounding our sex life. For me, having a regular schedule and knowing that it's meeting my needs has boosted his confidence and reduced an immense amount of stress. As an added bonus, getting rid of the stress and frustration surrounding our sex life has also improved the quality of our sex quite a bit.

I have finally hit my breaking point. I've posted here before, I've had ""The Talk"" repeatedly, but last night finally came to a head. It's just not going to work. She suggested that maybe I need to find someone to make me happy, because she just isn't good enough to do it. She said that I am not the person you want. 

She's right. 

I want someone that treats me more like a husband and less like a roommate. She says that she loves me, after having our kids. 

I am terrified to do what i think i need to do, but angry at him at the same time. I bear the burden now of helping her rather than him, and i understand why he left. But I see a mirror of my situation. I live in a fantasy world hoping that one day she will make a turnaround and be the woman I remember her as, but her anxiety issues have paralyzed her. She can show touch love to the kids, and loves to cuddle with them. But I am limited to 10 minutes after lights are out with my arm around her, feeling like I am trying to hold onto a stack of lumber. She has put up her wall and has decided for us that this is how our life will be. I'll be dad to her kids. The life I have tried to build has failed. I feel like I have worked so hard with my career, my kids, my happiness... 

But I can't live feeling like I am just an ornament in the house, but not as a husband; but as the father of her kids or the caretaker of the house. She will not try, maybe i've been tossed to the land of the male friends and she will occasionally screw me just to keep peace. 

I'm trying not to cry at work; I'm the strong one, I'll hurt my kids.. I'll be the dad that left when they were 7 and 2. Why the fuck does she do this?? Why doesn't she fucking care that this hurts me so bad but claims to love me. I hurt so damn bad right now, and tonight I'll go home and she'll act like our 2 am fight never happened. 

I have to compose myself now. In 20 minutes I need to be the leader again

I doubt that anyone who is on the opposite side of this situation browses this sub. But if you are the one who can't or won't show love to the other person for the sake of the other person

1. If you REALLY don't see them like that anymore, and nobody will be happy.

2. If you really do LOVE the other person, TRY to make an effort. Speaking for those in this situation, I would feel 1000 times better if I knew that there was actually some effort, some initiative, something other than what I am in now. It doesn't have to be a landslide of touches and kisses; start small. Let them know that you love them and that you will try to overcome whatever has come between you that has brought BOTH of you to this point. Move them from the bottom of the priority list to the top for a few minutes. And those of you that need touch to feel loved, remember that they might not get the same ache that you do for physical contact; and try to find what it is that does make them feel needed.

Well, I resigned myself to just suck it up and be the best dad I could to our children.  Leaving just doesn't seem like an option.  If I don't bother her about affection and intimacy, we get along just fine as basically roommates and raise our children.  The children are happy and so I must find a way to be happy as well with the life I made.  Most days it's good and I love my children more than anything, but days like today I feel like shit.  I've learned to cope.  I've built up a huge wall around that part of me that desires intimacy and passion in a relationship - something I've never experienced really.  I just shut off those emotions and find other ways to be happy.  Sometimes though it boils over and I have to address it.

How can she be so content to go for weeks on end with not even a hug?  I have to initiate 99% of the intimacy and it's very clear it's all for me.  I can't comprehend someone who is this unemotional and adverse to affection.  Why is she so insensitive to any of my feelings?  Even when I'm sick or in the emergency room she's annoyed.  ""Suck it up"".  I've heard that more than I would like.  She doesn't know how to deal with someone with any emotions and it's not like I'm some basket case.  I'm just a man who wants a wife who is there for him and desires him.  And she just seems so happy going on that way.  Everything is always 'fine'.  It seems so robotic and unemotional to me.  Sure

In the end I know that you can't make someone be something they aren't.  She's too set in her ways to change.  She'll never be a sexual being I know that.  She'll always be 'fine'.  She'll never really care if we hug or kiss passionately.  Take it or leave it.   I also know that my life is pretty good outside of that.  Being roommates with your spouse and having a good life is not the end of the world.  I have an amazing family and I won't take them for granted.

1360648650.0,18d31q,[update2] What I did about my dead bedroom,AsAlwaysItDepends,55,9,19,"Update on [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/133vo9/update_what_i_did_about_my_dead_bedroom/) and [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/102ah8/what_i_did_about_my_dead_bedroom/)...

I've seen posts on here about people who have a day or a week of sex and are dealing with the 'will it last' anxiety. Things have been going well for my wife and I for a while now and we are still working things out. I felt

What fixed our problem was me realizing that things were not good. In fact

Our lives are really different now that I've left the '[man box]'(http://www.charlieglickman.com/2011/05/the-performance-of-masculinty/) and understand what she needs from me. She's seen me change, by keeping communication open.

I found myself still having 'triggers'. One morning I woke early to piss, I said, 'relax, everything is OK, it's 6am, she's getting up soon anyway, go and spoon her and then she'll wake up and we'll do hugs and touch, slide over, ""I'm late

But I couldn't.

And she could tell. And so she kind of felt it was out of the blue and wtf? and we have kids and jobs and there's no time to really talk and so we left for work upset. And as our discussion of things continues in the nooks and crannies of our life, and going along quite admirably, frankly, for 9 months or so, but I had insecurities that she wasn't taking initiative. That it was on me to keep her engaged sexually and that if for whatever reason I laid back on keeping things physical, then, well

We make an appointment for the counsellor and *even though I had never actually brought up my anxiety that she wasn't taking initiative* she took the initiative and suggested that we have some time

So we went to a counsellor and the feeling I am getting is that she wants me 'fixed'. That she thinks she gets it, asked for a moment to collect myself and left, come back and said, ""Wait, I feel very misunderstood here."" or at least even ""Something isn't right, I need some time to think about it, let's talk about something else for a while."" But I don't process emotions very quickly like that, quite honestly. So instead I just kind of sat on things

Thennnn her brother came over for dinner (uninvited, and we didn't get to talk that night and she went to bed anxious about what I was thinking and somewhere in the middle of the night I read an email she had sent about wanting to know what was up. And something in the email hit on that note of her not knowing how deep in the hole I was, how totally broken down emotionally I was. This unspoken sentiment, ""right in this house, I was dying inside and you didn't do anything."" That feeling.

But here is the thing. I was talking to myself and not to her. How could she know how I felt, she would have started crying and I would have run from the emotion. But, at counselling, that would have been *exactly* the time to share those feelings. To say, ""When I'd shave in the morning, I'd watch the water flush the soap and whiskers from between the blades of my razor and the word 'suicide' would pop into my head."" But I didn't say that at counselling, instead what I did was hold my feelings back, and then

And that email bounced back and forth about a dozen times between us with lots of 'wtf' before we finally sat on the couch after the kids were in bed and talked. She felt betrayed and sad and confused. I felt embarrassed and angry and misunderstood. And we talked. We talked for a while, we'd reconnected. We'd been reading a book the counsellor recommended ""Hold Me Tight"" (very hard to read, so full of *feelings*, ugh, not a joke, my wife found it hard to deal with). I read about 'attachment anxiety' and various other quite helpful comments, and frankly its quite lucky because it gave me the words to explain what was freaking me out. 

It was quite shocking the way things returned to normal. Among other things, I need to get that distraction off my mind and it will obviously be awkward anyway'. It lasted about a day, if I recall correctly. I'm also going to therapy on my own for now, reading the book gave me some sense that perhaps I need some conversation about having felt disconnected all my life. It's been a recurring theme when I talk about families - my dad was pretty distant, as a middle child of 4 and with an older brother with 'issues' I didn't get much attention and my personality is the kind to withdraw anyway.... So I have been to a counsellor, and so far it's been a lot of 'tell me your story.' I also dug back into some Meyers-Briggs stuff, and I think that perhaps my feelings of emotional remoteness are just the way I'm put together. Plus

So

1. It minimizes the importance of a healthy sexual relationship.

2. It characterizes the HL partner as somewhat of a deviant

Here is how I'd respond to the statement: 

No, I have told you how important this issue is to me. We've had ""the talk"" many times. We've gone to counseling. I have tried to solve this problem by myself.

I do so because I respect your wishes and want you to see that I value your opinion on matters that are important to you.

I have seen by your behavior and words that you have no corresponding respect for me. You do not care what my opinion is on matters that are important to me and have no plans to make even the slightest change in your behavior to accommodate my wishes. Your lack of respect towards me on this issue is why I'm leaving you. You have told me by your words and behavior that this issue is MY problem to address by myself.  

Your words and actions over the preceding months and years tell me enough to realize that you do not respect or value me

2.  Keep wishing! Wish and wish and wish for your partner to change. Hey, he's right, I've been a fool and now I want that body!"" Do you see that happening? You can never, ever change your partner.

One thing I hear often from LL partners is that you're simply just ""not in the mood"". You don't feel horny and don't actively desire sex. I believe that from a strictly physical standpoint, distracted, etc. The difference is that our desire for sex is a psychological one. The closest I can describe it is eating not because you're hungry or are even craving that specific food, but because you know its delicious and you're going to enjoy it. 

So if you are wondering how to kick-start your sex drive, you enjoy making your partner feel good. Even if your body isn't responding - can't get hard or wet - there are many other things you can do that's not PIV sex that still feels good and can be enjoyable for the both of you.

I'm 29f, we both had a high sex drive and a lot of passion for each other. 

About a year and a half later, it just lost all appeal.  It felt like a lot of exhausting and pointless work.  The change was dramatic and overnight, and I was confused and devastated.  I never realized how much my sex drive was a part of my identity until it was gone.

I blame birth control.  But it took me a very long time to realize that birth control was the problem

I got off the pill once I realized

In the meantime

I had been in his position before.  Years before him, I knew that it makes you feel unwanted, unattractive, unloved, worthless.  And I still found my boyfriend very attractive, it's just that my hormones made the sex act unappealing.  

So I did everything I could.  I kept communication open, that I still love him and still find him attractive.  I made it a priority to have sex with him as much as I could stand to, I would make the effort to say yes as often as I could.  And we were still having sex an average of twice a week, sometimes more.

I went and saw a doctor.  I got my hormone levels checked, they'd need multiple levels throughout the month PLUS they would need multiple levels throughout the month BEFORE my sex drive dropped.  All they could tell is that I don't have any key hormones missing - for example, my testosterone isn't zero.  

I got a copper IUD, but this was a price I was willing to pay to get my sex drive back.

But it wasn't quite the same.  He has an overly high sex drive if anything, he missed feeling the passion on both ends.  I wasn't doing the dead fish thing, in fact I think we were having some very good sex during that time, but no amount of cheerful effort is quite the same thing as a partner who is desperately horny for you and can't wait to rip your clothes off - and he wasn't getting that from me.

I understood this.  I'm not a very jealous person

Well, as well as doing lots of favors for her.  Then he told me that it's only a one way open relationship - I figured we were both allowed to go outside the relationship, but I was voluntarily choosing not to act on it.  Well it turns out no, he wants permission but won't give me the same permission.  Then there were lies, where I'd find out later that he was doing more than he was actually telling me.  And when he would come home, he would be distant and feel weird, it was coming between us.  During this time, right when my sex drive first dropped a few months earlier.

I finally put my foot down and said that enough is enough.  And he agreed to close the relationship.  But it turns out that in his mind

The affairs continued but I didn't know, my sex drive is slowly coming back.  It's not quite as strong as it used to be but there are times I'm genuinely horny for him, and I am continuing to make that effort even when I'm not.  

Then, he hasn't been happy for a long time, he needs some time away to figure himself out, he wants us to take a break and he wants to move out.  From the tone, it sounds like he's pretty final that he doesn't want to fix anything or figure anything out or even try.  He's saying he wants a break and maybe we can talk in a month, but it sounds like he's really wanting out.

It makes no sense.  Everything was fine.  I try to talk to him but I can tell he's just not open to anything I""m saying.  

He goes to bed.  I can't sleep at all.  I hear his phone make a noise like he's getting a text message.  And for the first time in our entire 3 year relationship, saying he wants to leave me for her.

Four months earlier, it was just a matter of time.

I'd like to start off by saying that I am in no way qualified as a therapist or counseller. I'm just someone who's been there and can see it from your perspective. I'll also go out on a limb and say that this advice (and anything helpful you get out of it

I had written up my own very long-winded tale

If you're living in a sexless relationship, do everything you possibly can to be together. Like i said, I'm no sex therapist, but I've lived the situation and gone through many of the different treatment types available. I hope that this proves to be at least a little helpful. Also, as i said before, you can AMA in the comments below.

**DETERMINE IF THERE ACTUALLY IS A PROBLEM**

Think about it: are you like me, then your problem isn't as bad as you may think. Talk to them about frequency.

**DO NOT ASSUME THAT IT WILL JUST FIX ITSELF**

If you really do believe that it's an issue

**TELL YOUR PARTNER HOW YOU FEEL**

Seems pretty basic, stop talking about it until you both calm down. If you start fighting about it, the problem WILL get worse. You need to be completely calm, supportive, and open to everything they have to say. Let them know that you've noticed you've been less intimate lately and that it's a concern for you. Communicate your needs. tell them how it's made you feel. You have to be firm with this point. Your partner MUST understand that this is an issue for you, and that it's not something that they can just brush aside. Ask them if anything has changed in the relationship. Ask them if anything is stressing them out or if there is anything you've been doing that you may not have noticed. Get them to open up in any way you can.

A healthy relationship consists of two people who listen to each other and honestly care about how the other feels. Couples who don't share are doomed to fail. always. Above all

**LISTEN TO WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY**

If you succeed in getting them to open up, get upset over what they tell you. they'll close themselves off and the problem WILL get worse. There will be tears on both sides, and, if your partner trusts you completely, you may hear things that you hadn't even considered. Past abuse for example. Physical issues. Depression/Mental problems. Poor body image. The solution may be as simple as getting some romance back in your life, or as tough as heavy medication and physical therapy. You're never going to know until you have that conversation and hear them out. And after that, you may have to...

**ACKNOWLEDGE ANYTHING THAT IS YOUR FAULT**

Odds are, and the problem resides 100% in your partner. It's never that black and white. It can be painful to the Ego, but the problem could reside in you. Perhaps you don't talk to them as much anymore. Or you don't do things together. This is where the romance part comes in... dates, movies, cooking... Spending time with one another… not quick fixes, but a stepping stone.

It could be worse though. Maybe they're bored with your sex life. Do you do the same thing over and over again? Do you take the time to please them or only care about your own needs? Has anything changed about you physically? have you put on weight? Perhaps they aren't attracted to you any more. Sucks to hear

If you're part of the problem, put some effort in to lose it. If you aren't doing it for them in the bedroom, then communicate how you both can make that better. If you really want to situation to change, then you may have to share the blame. Do this graciously. your partner won't forget it.

**DON'T BLAME YOURSELF COMPLETELY**

Seems counter to the last bullet, your partner is just as much to blame about letting the lack of intimacy get to the point that it is now. They should have voiced their concerns earlier. Sure, it can be tough to tell your partner that they're putting on weight or that they don't have any idea where the clitoris is, but these conversations NEED TO HAPPEN EARLY. Your partner shouldn't have been so mousey and just come out and said it. the problem could have been nipped in the bud sooner, and you guys could have been having more happy moments than arguments.

It could turn out that the only thing you've done wrong is not communicating your needs. This was my situation. I waited too long and things went haywire. If you are only guilty of waiting too long, and as tempting as it is for some people to play the blame game, you CANNOT do it here. If you need to, go to your partner for reassurance. If they care for you, they'll give it. If you're feeling down about your body, then hit the gym, or post a pic of yourself in r/gonewild. It sounds trite and narcissistic

**DO NOT TAKE THE RELATIONSHIP TO ANOTHER LEVEL**

Ask yourself: Why would you want to take a relationship to another level when you're unsatisfied with your sex life? My ex-girlfriend convinced me that moving in together would solve all of our sexual problems. IT WON'T. Neither will joining bank accounts, or getting married. Doing any of things serves nothing other to make the problem much, much worse than it is, as you're more committed to this person than before. do NOT Let your partner convince you otherwise. It sounds harsh, but they have to know that the relationship will not progress unless this problem is fixed.

**CONFIDE IN SOMEONE**

I told absolutely no one i knew about what was happening in my relationship. Part of this was shame, an emotional basketcase. Find a friend or relative that you trust completely and confide in them. seek someone nonjudgemental, who will offer advice only if asked. Sometimes, it can be good just to vent. Or, you may find some insight that you hadn't thought of from someone who knows you and your partner well. Embarrassment be damned. Put yourself out there emotionally. Unless you choose to confide in a total asshole, they won't judge or think any less of you for it.

I mentioned [last time](http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/tc3on/i_dont_think_there_is_a_fix_to_this/) that I was doing the scrub-sponge thing. I also stopped expecting or even hoping for sex from my wife (least I could do, disappointment, frustration, whatever. We had a great family day. As the day was winding down, my wife made sure to show me she was moving the signal to ""Sex OK"".  So after the kids went to sleep we got down to business. She made more of an effort to actually be responsive, it was a big improvement from the last time. I went to finger her and she was already wet. We had good sex in multiple positions, and we both agreed that we hadn't had good sex like that since our dating stage. 

So skip to today. The signal is back at ""No Sex"", so I ask if she wants to watch porn together. Just watch, no expecations of anything else. She says she's not really ""at that state of mind right now"" and I tell her I understand and it's okay. I suggest we go to sleep. She says ""Really? Just sleep? Are you okay with that?"" Knowing what she's getting at, I crane my head around to check the signal. Still at ""No Sex"".  She says ""Oh did I forget to move that? You could probably move that to the other position."" So I initiated and again she was more responsive. She even gave me a small BJ, something she hates doing! Again another round of good sex. I'm still in awe.

It wasn't perfect, but I figured DB could use some good news every now and then, and I don't have many other people I could talk to about this. I consider the DB community here to be as much of a support group of friends as one I'd have in real life, so...

My husband and I had a good sex life for the first few months we were together. For the remainder of our relationship and engagement I was unable to have sex with him. We went through several months of infrequent sex

Emotional issues and physical pain combined with my inability to get very wet and a a general lack of sexual desire caused my LL. I am also a very busy person. Working full time, planning a wedding for about eight months, etc. I was always tired. I AM always tired. So that didn't help either.

A few months ago (about a month before the wedding) I decided I wanted to do something about it. I was sick of being the problem. We have ZERO other relationship issues. My husband is so understanding and never made me feel guilty about being unable to have sex with him. 

We slowly started having sex again. About once a month or so. And doing other sexual things about once a week. Thats when I found this subreddit. I had lurked on reddit before but never had an account. I decided to make an account and got pretty active all over the site. 

Hearing the stories everyone tells on this site had me more motivated than ever to fix my DB. I took some advice. I've stopped masturbating when I'm in the mood. Instead I wait until my mood matches up with a time that we're both home. The longer I do this

I had a discussion with my wife last night about our recent visit with my sister. She doesn't get along with my sister well (my sister is one of those folks people either like or don't like). Meanwhile

So we were hashing over some stuff that happened, my wife wanted to call my sister and see if she was bent out of shape and if so, say ""sorry"". So I reply with something like ""Why don't I call, she's my sister, I can say, 'we wish we'd have done things differently, I hope it wasn't too big a deal for you'."" My wife replied that she would do it all the same again

And it dawned on me that this is the core sentiment of the ""It's not you

My wife wanted my sister to know that skipping mass wasn't about us trying to be disrespectful or careless of my sister's feelings or judging her faith or anything like that. She was worried that our actions might have made my sister feel insecure. But what my wife didn't get, she's not feeling insecure in the least –she's upset that we didn't go to mass! It's about religion, it's not something we are going to work through.

So to translate this into a deadbedroom, perhaps, they are saying is, ""I don't know what to do about my failure to want sex, it's nothing you have done, I'm really sorry that it hurts your feelings, but you are blameless, so I guess we'll have to just have this sexless second-rate marriage."" Why does this make sense to them? It's probably because they recognize that marriages are 'supposed' to have sex in them

But it's not like that, and that they want physically and that they can't just make 'peace' with.

So, and I appreciate that you might feel like you don't know what to do and that you've failed me somehow. But look, I still love you, and I don't blame you, but what we need to do is work together on this. I am glad that it's nothing I've done because I've really been trying, but we need to really understand this better. When we aren't being physical, it's not just that I feel like something is missing, and we can talk more about this when we've had a chance to sleep on it.""

Then, and you talk about counseling or books you could read together or porn or how their feelings changed over time. And you do all of this in a supporting way.

When I first laid eyes on my boyfriend 4 years ago I heard all the bells and angels singing and the fireworks went off. Oh how they went off and I knew he was it for me. He's been it for me ever since that night and no one else and nothing else has made me feel as fulfilled and loved as being with him. I never wanted to get married or have kids really

The sex really started dwindling around the year and a half mark. It took me completely by surprise because he was 24. You don't expect your 24 year old red-blooded American boyfriend to lose interest in you sexually especially when you haven't gained any weight or changed your behavior. According to the media and society at large (it seems) a 24 year old man is supposed to be willing to have sex with you no matter what. Drunk, broken up, asleep, gay, dead. He's supposed to want sex so badly that he'd do anything for it and yet, mine would rather Reddit or clean or stare at a wall. It's to the point where any time anyone on tv or in a movie mentions anything about women being frigid and men being sex-crazed, he and I share a really awkward pregnant pause and avoid eye contact.

I used to get really upset about it and cry and try to talk to him about solutions which always ended in blank stares and shrugs from him even when asked direct questions about his feelings/desires/opinions. I got the feeling that not only does he not know how to put into words how he feels, cook him meals, clean the house! And I used to do it all out of love and I used to genuinely like doing things for him, but now that's changing. Now the things I do make me angry because he doesn't care and apparently thinks of me as a roommate with tits that he sometimes touches. 

I could go have sex with the countless normal men in my life who are waiting out my relationship (there are many who have flat out told me this) but I have tunnel vision for him. Him not wanting me has made it even more important that he want me which turns him off more which gets me laid even less etc. forever. I stopped initiating very pointedly last year to see how long it would take for him to want it. Turns out we have sex roughly once every two months if I leave it entirely up to him. The worst part is, passionless and kinda gross because I'll be damned if I shave every day in case today is the day he happens to be a normal person. He will seem into it for about 30 seconds and then the moment I start to really get excited he shuts off. Immediately. It's so hurtful and insulting. I'm not allowed to be into it? I've told him that I don't even need to get off. I don't need massages or oral or any hour-long sessions. I want him to just barge in, tear my clothes off, have his way, and get off in two minutes if that's all he wants. Sex like that is actually really hot! Still nothing. He even turns down no-strings-attached blowjobs.

The closest he ever got to giving me any real tips on how to get him to fuck me was him saying that if I want sex I should just grab his cock and go for it with confidence. This technique has not proven useful and it's pretty laughable for him to tell me to grab his cock and jack him off when the minute I get near him with a sexual energy he heads for the hills.

I post in this subreddit somewhat frequently &amp; have a lot of redditor friends, a lot of people won't be open to it. If you can make it work, its amazing.

My darling lover was in a DB for about a decade before he met me. Same story, and mostly massage parlor visits. It helped a little.

He is a very attractive man in his late thirties, LL and all. 

He was oddly detached from his sexuality when we first met, and make time to absolutely fuck like rabbits, at least five times a week. Sometimes twice a day. 

We are affectionate, he isn't bitter towards his wife anymore. He goes home and is happy. He isn't frustrated with her like he was before. He still tries to initiate, much less often (I think every couple weeks as opposed to almost daily before). She turns him down all the time, but he doesn't turn it into a fight anymore. Because he isn't frustrated or aggravated (due to lack of release and also a healthy outlet for nonsexual emotional intimacy), she's eased up too. She doesn't feel pressure. The energy between them cooled.

For the last five months

We have been ""seriously"" together a year, she has a lot of rules and its pretty rigid. But it's a stepping stone. 

She is aware of my existence (vaguely) and isn't bitter. I'm helping her, we just like to fuck.  

I'm younger than my partner, and this works.

I found this subreddit by accident and I read my story over and over.  How closely I identify with the feelings and emotions felt by other men in our situation is what surprises me the most.  

I’m just like many of you.  Wife is awesome other than the sex drive part.  In that department: she NEVER initiates, can go months without sex, is definitely not a partner is sex, when we do have sex, she rushes it and just wants it to be over.

Sex is not something she WANTS to do it’s something required of her.  Her idea of being sexually active is letting me know it is an appropriate time to have sex

I lay awake at night unable to sleep because I am so frustrated.  Some nights I think my frustration is so obvious that she is going to let me know that “it’s ok to have sex tonight” but then my frustration is compounded when she just goes to sleep and I don’t even get that option.  If I initiate sex she goes into robot mode it’s pretty obvious she has to do it and is not into it – that is worst part – having sex with someone who you want to be your partner and them making them feel like you are taking something from them

We’ve been together for 13 years and for years I’ve tried talking to her and being very honest and open.  There might be little glimmers of hope here and there, then turned it off again after she was.

and with that I give you a quote from Arrested Development:
&gt;Tobias: You know, I have advised a number of couples to explore an open relationship where the couple remains emotionally committed, but free to explore extra-marital encounters.

&gt;Lindsay: Well

&gt;Tobias: No, but ... But it might work for us.

The only purpose of suggesting an open relationship to our partners might be that they would hopefully perceive it as a threat to their comfort zone thereby compelling them into action.  Plus for some of us

Of course when I was in my DB my thoughts wandered to this and cheating as well.  Mulling over both of those focused me to finally end the relationship.  If I was willing to take a chance to inflict that much pain back onto my spouse then I should be willing to get through the pain of divorce.  Once you get down to the extremes of cheating or an open marriage it should trigger an inflection point of logic in you that exceeds your emotional connection to this person that obviously does not deeply love you.  Be the better person and leave at that point.

This is so painful

I'm a 30 year old male.  I've been in a dead bedroom for about 8 years (the entirety of my marriage).  My story is basically the same as everyone else's - fucked like rabbits, but no intimacy to speak of.  I feel like I'm missing a huge part of my life here - it makes me feel like shit.  I'm sure many can relate.

I'm so torn on this.  I have two young kids so that complicates this tremendously.  My options seem to be hold it together when I'm unhappy for the kids' sake or break up their happy home.  It's just such a shit situation to be forced into.  I've struggled with this so much that I just feel tired or dealing with it -- I need closure.

What I really want is to have the girl that I fell in love with back

I've seriously considered cheating or asking for an open marriage

In the last 6 months or so I've read nearly every post in this sub and feel everyone's pain so deeply that it actually makes me cry sometimes.  I empathize with every post I read and hate that we are in this situation.  I just want it to go away but it does not.

I've improved myself relentlessly over the past 5 years thinking it was me to blame

I am planning to speak to a divorce attorney this week or next.  I am not pressed for time so I plan to get all of my ducks in a row before executing anything.  I am not threatening divorce as a bargaining chip - If that's what it takes to have my needs met then I don't really want to have this relationship anymore.

If this sub is interested

Thanks for reading.  I know how bad this hurts everyone who is in this situation.  I wish i could fix it for everyone but it seems like i can't even fix it for myself.  So time to give up.

But we just had ""the talk""

Honestly, the kisses and the hugs and my giving foot-rubs and back-rubs were there; the going further in life together, supporting each other and being excited about each others' successes were there too.  We supported one another and I thought we loved one another, and that the only issue was that we didn't have sex.

But some of that was happening out of habit; I found out she hasn't been ""happy"" for a year, out of habit and a feeling of obligation.  Finally, she went on a trip with some girls, had some time away, and she decided that it was time to have her ""talk"" with me.  It took 45 minutes and an ocean of tears, but she was out the door with my mouth on the floor.  Counselors, money fixes, trying to share more interests; they all were not a possible fix she wanted to entertain.  She had made up her mind finally.

We seem to have an attitude in this subreddit that ""it is what it is"", and building up the courage to ""dump em already"".  I reject the premise of ""it is what it is"".  After all, I used to have a fulfilling sexual relationship.  I would think most of us here had it good at some point, otherwise we never would have gotten together with our partners in the first place.

As for the causes

* It's natural libido differences

* It's birth control

* You used to be more attractive


I wanted to open up more of a discussion on the causes.  After reading several books (Married Man Sex Life

Our dead bedroom doesn't have a single cause or two.  It's a lot of compounded causes that come and go.  Each of these stages lasted from a few months to years.  Many different causes

1) We are first dating

2) She has a close family member unexpectedly pass away.  She is very depressed (cause 1) and has 0 libido.  I'm still in the honeymoon phase.

3) I get frustrated from lack of sex

4) She gets over the loss of her family member, going out of my way to do everything for her, putting her on a petestal, practically friendzoning myself. (making cause 3 much worse)

5) I snap because it's not working and take it out verbally on her.  She feels unloved. (cause 4)

6) I read ""Married Man Sex Life"" and get an eye opener into the Alpha-Beta qualities of men and what women are attracted to.  The book really resonates well, I'm convinced that she simply isn't attracted to me and never will be.  We stop being lovey, cuddly, etc.  I start sleeping in the other room.

7) I plan the divorce talk.  Then one day, she no longer found me unattractive, she found me very attractive (i was acting and dressing more attractive, had lost 25 lbs), but things were so bad between us that she couldn't possible sleep with me.  We both cry in each other's arms.

8) We start being nice to each other again.  We're in a cute

9) I read Intimacy and Desire and it resonates very well with what's going on.  Every time we have a nice day

And that's where we find ourselves now.  Still not fixed but at least we aren't at each other's throats

Hopefully this wall of text can help someone out there.  What I wouldn't give to go back to stage 2 or 3 or 4

I love you. I am writing this because I love you. I hope you never have to see this because I love you. You hurt me. I love you and you hurt me


I come home every night angry and depressed and moody because I know it will be another night of the same reserved and emotionally distant wife.


Sex; it's the biggest thing between us right now. We have it, not like you enjoy it. You may get off, but that’s only the end of a quick road. You lay there and do nothing. I want you to touch me. I want you to kiss me, to reach for my lips or pull me to you, like you can't get enough of me. I want you to cuddle afterward and tell me that you enjoyed it, that it was wonderful, that you liked that ‘little thing I did” if there was one. You lay there and do nothing, but you show none of it yourself. You give me the impression that sex is a chore to you


I have asked for blowjobs or other forms of play numerous times, and I try. I touch you, and suggest to you and make hints, but you need to give in to those touches or hints. You need to give in, and believe that it is worth it to do so. You fight me and say no.


I am clearly not allowed to touch you while you sleep to wake you up


You deny me the privilege of giving you oral sex. You say it's because you don't enjoy it. You let me do it before early on in our relationship, with my hands and tongue as much as with my penis.


I love your breasts. I am denied those now as well. You tell me it's uncomfortable but I believe it is something else. You need to describe it in words I understand. If I can't touch them at all


I'm not allowed to touch your clitoris


I try kissing and touching you elsewhere on your body, or uncomfortable. You don't communicate to me what you want. You don't tell me what you like so every time I try I feel like I'm doing something wrong and I get discouraged. You kill the passion in me so quickly this way. You've mostly removed me from the lovemaking I so want, so how am I supposed to show passion? Where has the trust gone? Why have you shut me out? Why are you so closed down? Am I not allowed inside to know anymore?


You say that I satisfy you and that you are satisfied, so you don't try. I think that you think I should be happy with what I get. It's selfish of me to expect more. It's selfish for you to think that I don't need more because you're happy with what you get. You deny me. You make me hope. You make me think ""Maybe this time she will actually want it, want me"". It never happens. ""Maybe she will be in to it. Maybe she will need me and desire me and need me inside her. Maybe she will feel what I feel for her. My desire, my want, my need, my love.""


I am practically begging you for your attention and for your love. This begging has made you lose respect for me. You don't feel I'm worthy of your touch. You don't make the time for it. You won't put it before anything else. Only when it's convenient. Only under specific conditions. At the end of this show. If I'm not too tired. If I'm feeling ok. You will do nothing to improve those conditions. Do it before it's bed time. Do it during nap time. Record the show and come back to it later. Do you not see that I am willing to interrupt my day for you? It's not an interruption for me; it is the reason for my day, and not something to put first before everything else. I am not worthy to you.


We did that quiz together but you have wholly dismissed it. I asked you to take it seriously and you haven't. I thought this was a way for us to open up to each other. I have sent you websites to read that express how I feel. I don’t believe you understand what I am feeling. I wrote you notes


We have talked about it so many times you have become calloused and uncaring to my needs. You say you are trying and I don't see it. What are you trying? Where is the effort? Should I be seeing something I am not seeing? We had a conversation about you being less resistant to sex, video games, these are not the way. They are small bandages over an aching heart that wants you and your touch more than anything else.


I am fragile. I need constant reassurance because you have broken me. You have made me a servant. I can’t stay this way much longer. Open up to me and share yourself with me and let me love you. Accept my love and give it back to me. How do I get you to do this? What do I need to do for you to see that you have hurt me. How do I get you to let me touch you? How do I make you see that I am worthy and that I don’t need to beg;? Why don’t you need and want me like I want you? Why do you make it seem that you do not want to change anything? Why won’t you touch me? Why won’t you love me.

More Details:


How we met.  She is the sister of a classmate of mine from College.  She was taking a program and needed a place to stay.  My classmate let me know as we were (and still are) very good friends.  I was in an apartment with another friend and we had the room so we welcomed her in.  She stayed for the summer and found a place in the apartment building across from ours.  When she moved out, but I know that I came directly after one that lasted for years.  A bad breakup I must assume, a relationship that was leading to marriage (there was talk of him thinking of proposing) and I believe he cheated.  She's never told me this, but I can guess.


At 20, she was about the same (at 5'9"").  Being content, loved, things have gotten a bit worse as it's easy to let yourself go when someone accepts you for who you are.  I'm now 250 lbs.  She's gained weight because of having kids, obviously, and is now around 225.


We have two children now


We are both professionals.  She makes more money than I do.  Our combined income is good, my job is not protected.


I came from a family that struggled to put food on the table.  I felt underprivileged but I know there are many who were far worse off than I.  She grew up fairly well-to-do and is very independent.  Our attitudes clash at times, as I feel that I was denied that safe feeling when I was growing up and want to be that kind of person because it was what I wanted.  Her independence has a difficult time accepting or giving in when she has difficulty, and comes to a head when she actually can't do something, leading to her breaking down on the rare occasion.",,False,,1376492447.0,t3_1kaday

1372251519.0,1h3s6w,Musings on dead bedroom and marriage in general,prim3numb3rs,50,10,46,"So. I've been reflecting upon the deadBedroom situation over the past years and I wondered if any gents or ladies would care to pontificate upon the anatomy of a dead bedroom. 

How does a functioning relationship become a dead bedroom ? And how do so many of us find ourselves in one without ever seeing it coming. ?And why do some people stay in miserable situations even though they have no hope. I don't speak of people who are in a db because of an illness. I mean those who are married to a fully capable adult who simply chooses to not have sex with their spouse. People have all sorts of excuses but if they wanted to they would. 

Does anyone else notice personality changes after being in a db for extended time?

I myself noticed that after being in a dead bedroom for 7.5 years it changed my personality. After speaking to someone else who observed similar changes. I'm much more cynical now. I am less patient. I've become a porn addict 

I view bad sex or a lack of sex ( except for physical illness situations) as justification for breaking up whereas in the past I would have tried to teach or fix things. 

I no longer do things just for the sake of niceness ( massage 

I view marriage through a darkened  lens now. I see happy couples who are courting but not married and I envy them immensely. 

 I see people who are married for 20 years or more and I see an underlying level of disappointment and complacency. Perhaps a smattering of resentment. Resigned to their fate.  but no one dares speak about it. They say they are happily married but I'm not sure who they are trying to convince. Me or themselves. 

Don't get me wrong. There are some people who are genuinely happy together. But I have only met a handful who seemed genuine. Most just parrot the words. 

In the past people stayed together for life because they had no other option. Societal expectations. Religious gobbledygook. Fear of change. Not wanting to downsize. Financial stuff. 
In this day and age we are not tethered by that sort of thing.   We have choices. Some choose to be unhappy. But why? 

Coming from someone whose parents stayed together ""for the kids"" even though they were miserable I can definitely say that this isn't the 1950s and my life would have been much happier if they had divorced. Other redditors say the same kind of things. I'm sure it affected my sense of self worth watching my mother throw away a large portion of her life In a clearly unhappy situation witg no affection between parents until she finally couldn't take anymore and abandoned the kids. Leaving me to take care of younger siblings. Anything would have been better than that

Married for 9 years, everything bad that I was feeling was his fault and I shut down.

A couple of months ago I found out that he had been having sex-chatting/emailing exchanges with women he met here on Reddit.  They shared pics and chats and masturbated together. He was even to the point of possibly meeting one of these women for something extra. I found this all out after asking to see his phone.  I knew for a few months he had had some Alien Blue app on his phone that had a passcode on it.  That set off a flag for me but when I asked him about it, I just kept on relying on the fact that he would never cheat or leave so I wouldn't have to listen to him.  I thought it was all just a bluff.

I will say that for a few of weeks before finding all of this out, everything.  But I started trying to change the way I thought about myself and him and had started to work on things within myself emotionally.  I hadn't really acted on things with him yet at the time but I was realizing that not everything was his fault and that I wanted to try and find the couple we used to be.  

After finding out about my husband's online activity

My husband has his faults and what he did was wrong, do it and leave me alone"" is also a jerk thing to say to someone.  And I did that.  Several times I did that.  

We both did things that got us to that point.  Maybe I wouldn't have handled it the way he did but I didn't handle it at all.

We aren't 100% fixed. I still have some days where I am not interested at all in sex or being intimate, we go to bed at the same time now, we talk about things we stopped sharing with each other.  I do have trust issues with him now. When I get worried or freaked out, I talk to him about it. So my advice to anyone that is going through this is don't stop talking.  I don't know if it will always help.  I know if I hadn't begun to realize the problem and start to through it myself before I discovered these things he had been doing, I have no idea if my reaction would have been the same. I doubt it would have. I probably would have been out the door in a second and everything would still be completely his fault, or that's what I'd tell myself.  So just keep trying to talk to your SO about how you feel. It might not work in all circumstances but maybe it will.  I don't mind answering any questions you all have because I do realize I've probably rambled on here.

EDIT:  I got my SO to read this all last night.  He asked me why I made it sound like it was all my fault all of this happened.  I didn't really have an answer for that.

That night I drank, and asks why I was acting like ""my dog had died"" after he had gone to bed (He has to go to bed fucking EARLY for work, I'm talking 8 PM early), and what was I supposed to tell him, at work?

1352782507.0,133vo9,[update] What I did about my dead bedroom,AsAlwaysItDepends,48,12,23,"Update on [this post...](http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/102ah8/what_i_did_about_my_dead_bedroom/)

So May 24th was the day that my wife and I call our 'divine intervention' day, not the middle or the end...) Just by chance I'm a non-confrontational person, and I think it matters that I hadn't turned the sex issue into a battle ground.

So things are still going well, her working again, the busy pace of the holidays, plus she has a bit of Seasonal Affective Disorder (the gloom). Stress has always lead her away from the bed. My additional concern was that we were simply in the 'honeymoon phase' of a relationship 'renewed' over the summer, and when that faded, where would we be?

But as it turns out, but I feel like it's just a realistic pace for this part of our lives rather than a Bad Sign. We have to wait for the kids to get into bed and she has some days where she works nights etc etc, but maybe it makes more sense to explain why I feel like she really '*gets it*'.

She initiates a ton, when we were talking about what I needed from the relationship, I said how I'd like our physical connection to be woven into our lives the way our emotional connection was and she said that sounded perfect (to my surprise, quite honestly - I thought I'd have to sell it). I thought constant contact was important because I think she experiences responsive desire, so she'd need something to 'respond to' if we were going to have a sex life, but it couldn't be a 'here I am behaving in the I_want_sex way to get in your pants in 15 minutes' it had to be 'this is how I/we always behave' - both with physical connection and with emotional connection. A big part of making that work, I think, noticing her (her new clothes, still smiling' kind of text messages (trying to consider before I send it where she'll be when she reads it).

But beyond that, they stay around for a while), I make her coffee (I don't drink coffee, so it's something just for her) and other ""Acts of Service"" that show love (if you are 5lovelanguages person, she's ""words of affimation"" and ""acts of service""). These aren't difficult chores, they are things that are about her and a way of showing I'm thinking of her. I make the bed now after a decade of sort of stubbornly refusing to grow up about it and accept that adults make their bed even though they will just unmake it at night - a daily symbol that I've grown up, that I'm part of the relationship now. (For the 'alpha' people, a full time job and a part time job, but I make a point to do a few things that are me telling her ""hey sweetie, when she knows early in the night that she's going to crash out as soon as possible

Probably the most surprising night was after celebrating my mom's birthday at our house with my brother and his wife as well as my mom. Kind of a big deal, right? But before bed that night, after the kids were asleep and the kitchen clean, we were hanging out on the deck having a drink to unwind (which before we'd have just gone our separate ways to unwind) and we wind up in bed with actual recreational sex rather than sort of 'regular' sex.

I feel good because I see her exploring a small bit out of her comfort zone for me and our sex life, more inclined to grind and stick it in than have a big long touch-full 'session'. But we'll sometimes have longer sessions, and she shares her body more with me than before. She trusts me to respect her boudaries and she trusts me enough to move her boundaries a little bit (when she's up for it). And I think part of it too is that I'm getting better - communication helps a lot with that. So as much as I enjoy the new things we try, I don't push, I communicate how much I appreciate them and make sure she's happy with the way things are going also.

Trust is a big part of why this is working. Not just her trusting me, when I say that I like some new experiences in the bed room the way she likes to re-arrange the furniture. And honestly, she's had an open mind about it, and she's enjoying sex more than she used to. She really feels like the physical connection is a good part of our relationship that she wants to keep - not because of what comes with it, but for it's own sake.

Am I being 'alpha'? I'm not being 'cave man' alpha - I'm not ordering her around or 'dominating' her or trying to get other women interested. (I have been meaning to get a better idea of what married man sex life is about but haven't had a chance yet.) But I am making her feel safe and I am 'present' in the relationship now, sometimes that being honest about what I want - being 'all in' with the relationship. I used to be a 'whatever you want, no problem' guy, trusting her to read my mind or to have some magical ability to read my mind and 'just know' if something would be a bigger sacrifice for her or for me. It was a big deal when I told her I wanted to change the way we were having sex, that I felt closed out of it, and it was communication that lasted for a week. I worried that I was walking back the substansive progress we had made over sort of 'style' issues, but also felt like it was The Right Thing To Do - its both of us in bed, and that meant that I needed to tell her what I wanted. And we worked through it. And she understands that a little variety is important to me, I find that issues that used to result in sort of stand offs we tend to collaborate much better on.

It has been a slow process, that's respecting her boundaries.

We've both had experiences where we felt like things were 'going back' to how they were. One example, but then the kids and calendar got in the way and it was soon one night, then as little as a 12 hour trip. It was OK, but the 'before' me would be very very angry at the way things were scaled back, even though it was, in all fairness, unavoidable. I had done a TON of planning for fun sexy things AND for her type of things - restaurants she wanted to get to, a surprise dessert I was going to make her, barfing from midnight to 6am, right

So I hope this is helpful

At this point I have moved on, counseling, etc.. I still have pieces of lingering self-doubt about myself but I can deal with those points now without tying it back to her.  Her issues should have been obvious but it took me years to realize/acknowledge/accept them in full.  I do a very good job of not focusing on her faults (at this point) but I am going to list them out here for the sake of others that are trying to work through their own issues as I failed to accept these for long time:

* Bad upbringing - her parents never showed her any affection as a child. They are not evil people but they just did not show love and affection towards each other or her

* Alcoholism - she has been an alcoholic since the day I met her.  Now steadfastly sober for 19 months it is still part of her personality.  Al-Anon helped me tremendously in coping with this, discovering her caches of wine in all the various places, trying to control her drinking with ultamatims and such broke her respect/trust of me.  I was honestly trying to save her life but all she could focus on was that I was controlling her.  Here is the thing, once they are sober, all of those characteristics and behaviors are still there, they just lack alcohol at that point.  I certainly lost respect for her during the course of this.  Substance abuse kills relationships, no doubt.
  
* Depression and anti-depressants - as a happy optimist I had a hard time understanding the depths of this, she has not shed a tear since I filed for divorce.  Just no reactions at all.

* Sleeps all day in any situation - she has untreated sleep apnea.  Yes we bought a CPAP machine

* Diagnosed Cognitive Deficit - she lacks the full ability to make logical decisions that are in her best interest.  Cleared a little from getting sober

* Spends all free time watching TV or shopping - moved aggressively into this after stopping drinking

The bedroom story is so typical that I can breeze through it.  Good normal sex while dating and early in marriage, deal with it for years.  Pattern ensues, no regular affection, sex only once a week, foreplay from her dissapears, duty sex(""let's get this over with""), regular rejection begins to really hit me, The Talk

The bottom line is RESPECT.  If she loses respect for you for some reason or you lose respect for her for some reason it will begin a cycle of disrespect in both directions that spirals for years.  I think it is rare that a couple can break out of this.  Sadly I think I was the first one to lose respect for her because of the drinking

In the end you have to take ownership of yourself for yourself.  You have to set realistic timelines and acknowledge those when you reach them, getting counseling for myself(not the marriage), and investing time in myself by getting fit with running and diet.  A relationship can only work if both individuals have wholehearted independent lives which the other recognizes and respects.  That respect you have for how your partner carries on in their individual life is what binds you together as a solid couple.

The deadbedroom is a symptom of your relationship as a whole.  Without respect, so I just went ahead and closed it down, I did not see the eventual pain of having that discovered as worth it.

* Don't lose respect for your partner and yourself
* Read ""Sex Starved Marriage"" and ""Five Love Languagues"" and put true effort into it
* Get fit
* Have a social life
* Get personal counseling
* Open up to close friend/family that you trust has good judgement
* Don't cheat
* Get marriage counseling
* GTFO once you pass your line in the sand

[[[Keep in mind that it's just a letter to my husband

---------

I was thinking about when I start going to work all day and I know there is absolutely no way you're just not going to look at porn, and you think you're helping the situation by causing less drama or something. I can understand how difficult it is to risk putting yourself into a line of fire when you yourself believe what you are doing is completely harmless. 

So firstly, since I never feel like you care about reciprocating the same back- but I can fantasize that you desire me for that brief moment. I don't just get aroused psychologically, my true orgasm is psychological. You, are my orgasm. This is why the 'you can finish yourself off' line you used to give me completely shuts down everything- not only do I not get my mental orgasm, but that line shows a fundamental misunderstanding of how I function. Listen to your wife, and not the porn- I do not need my clit pounded in just the right way until some pressure builds up. All I need is to feel like my protector actually wants to put his penis in me. Honestly, if there's performance anxiety I don't understand because desire is all the technique you'll ever need

Feeling genuinely sexually desired is the ultimate activator of sex drive for me. We just need to work on cultivating your desire for me, and then you'll feel a lot more comfortable with me if I am libidinous rather than just sad and wishful.  

Every time you watch porn, long after you close them. After this year and a half of you choosing to do that over building intimacy with me, I already am unsure of whether or not it's possible to repair the distance I now feel. I can always feel when you have been depleted of that energy, I know when you have nothing left to give me. 

 So that's why spending your energy elsewhere is harmful- it directly denies me my greatest pleasure

This isn't our core problem, like many women have to do. I just hope you can fight with me to keep us together before I am too full of pain to stay. Damage to my esteem and vulnerability has already been done after all the rejection, I honestly can't imagine starting to get intimate again, all of this sounds really hypothetical. So please bear that in mind.

As you know

So while I still expect you to at least try to refrain most of the time (since you aren't ready to be able to talk to me about it openly)

- Take a pre-decided amount of time out of playing video games to read an email I've sent you. 
- Take a pre-decided amount of time out of playing video games to think about our relationship, or how you could communicate with me better, or how important it is for you to learn to be less angry, etc etc. You don't have to relay anything if you don't want, so long as you know you've made some progress.
- Plan a date for us, even going to the shooting range, extremely fun if I knew you simply wanted to spend time with me. 
- Just come up with something random to do with me that would make either of us feel closer. Maybe starting to build a tiny herb garden or experimenting with homemade pizzas. I thrive on spontaneous projects with my partner
- Do something active about your fear of intimacy- take a risk and talk to me about it. Think about why it's stressful and try to explain it to me. It doesn't matter if it doesn't make sense the first few tries, that strengthens my connection orgasm, so why wouldn't I want that?) Denying me understanding is convenient for your tendency to need to believe that 'I don't care' when you get self-protective, and it's not fair. I know you are avoidant but please think about how self-fulfilling that is. Once you feel more trusting of me, expressing yourself will get easier. Maybe one day you could send me something like this document, telling me how I can help you trust me. (Yelling bits and pieces during an outburst is unfortunately not effective, since my security system designed to protect my small female body in the face of a big out-of-control male has gone off and you won't get to see my empathy until it's deactivated.) 


If any of this is not what you want out of life, just guidance in case you decide you want me around. I would love for you to tell me what you need too, if you do decide that.

She doesn't need to touch or be touched by me now.  Maybe 3 weeks from now she'll be up for it again.

I know she can't control her sexuality and it is what it is.  It's always been that way.  If you see my other posts you'll know that I've been addressing this for years now and nothing changes.  We either wait for the stars to align and have our 10-20 minute session once a month (thinking of it that way is depressing)

Her getting in the mood once a month and only needing a quick session actually makes me feel worse.  It's like she has no real desire for me outside of that window and even then it feels like any guy would do at that time.  I feel so unwanted, but not her.  I am utterly unable to attract her no matter what I do.  It's just not important to her.  There are no structural, trust, other issues to address.  It just is what it is.

I can't see doing anything about it except basically just continuing on in the life *I* chose by marrying a low libido woman.  We have children and I just can't see doing anything else but sucking it up, just like the rest of our relationship.  We are so utterly incompatible in what we need out of a relationship.  I don't know how she is so content with our roommate agreement where my feelings and need for intimacy is more of an annoyance than anything.  Similarly, I don't think she understands why I would want passion.  It's not just sex, but overall intimacy and emotional connection.  No, I don't want to pour my feelings out to her every day and I know that you can't be needy in a relationship, especially as a man, but I would like some desire.

Things have progressed

[Sidebar: That's what I think is the most depressing thing out of this whole DB experience; you both have a talk, you really feel like you've taken a great step forward, only to realize 6 months later that things have slowly crawled right back to exactly the way it was... Rinse, repeat...  Where do you draw the line ?]

So, and she suddenly says: ""If you want me to stay home and just take care of you and I can't go anywhere and see anyone, then this won't work, because I am never going through that again!""  ...W-T-F...   There is nothing in our past that I can think of where this sentence is even applicable.  I didn't say that to her.  I just assured her that I meant nothing like that, and quite the opposite in fact.  I know that when she interacts with other people and goes out (with or without me) and mingles with a group, she comes back home rejuvinated, and happy.  We make it a point of each having at least one night per week free from the kids and each other.

[Another great sentence she threw at the very beginning of the conversation was: ""Why can't you just 'live'? Why do you have to stress about this?""]

At the end of the conversation

BUT, kisses me goodnight, a few hugs thrown in.  I like it.  Still no sex, but baby steps.  Remember that my main rant was the -touching- part.

So, I am still as resentful as before.  I don't really like that in myself because she is making an effort and I should mentally reward that.  Well, a week ago, I see an ebook called **Coming Home to Passion** by Ruth Cohn.  I read through it, and come to terms with the basis of the book which is that any sexual problem in the couple is 50-50.  So, I start thinking back on my childhood and realize a bit more **why** ""I stress about it"".  It is partly the sex, and partly the touching, I understand a bit more why I am still resentful even when she is making an effort.  I see opportunities where sex could happen and because she doesn't detect them or take advantage of them

That's my own problem to solve

I need her to flirt with me. I need her to tease me in the daytime.  I need her to tell me what she likes in our sexuality.  I need her to take her time when we have sex.  I need to feel like she is looking forward to sex

That's an awful lot of ""I"".  And that's the gist of it: realizing that mariage is being a team, then it may be time to play solo for the rest of the match.

It is hard, and waited. I have been patient. She knows this and agrees. But there are a few rare times when she is not exhausted from work and/or waking up a few times every night to care for the baby

One time before when I tried to initiate sex and got shot down, poor daddy."" I told her that was the most condescending, patronizing, insensitive thing she has ever done. And I told her that I was pissed, not sad. 


Then take tonight for example. It's the weekend, try to initiate sex by sitting by her and trying to kiss, etc. and got all the same responses: grunts, shrugs, eyerolls, pushing me away.. She said ""maybe I'm not in the mood.""  I said ""Maybe? There's always a slim to none chance you are."" I walk outside to smoke and come back in. She's getting ready for bed and acts like its no big deal.

I thought I have done everything I could to sensitive to what she goes through as the mother of my children and I have not push the issue hard, and wait some more for the time and opportunity. And when that opportunity comes up? When there is none of the usual excuses? She **STILL** isn't in the mood. 

I'm so tired trying that I don't want to even try anymore. I honestly cant take the rejection anymore. She *knows* this upsets me. I make it very obvious and I don't act passive-aggressive. I don't want a friend. I don't need a roommate. I need a spouse. One that wants and needs my affection just like I need hers.

The problem is is that now we haven't had sex for a few months because I just really don't want to initiate. Even she has noticed that I no longer seem to be in the modd. The problem is is that if I initiate and get shot down it makes me feel like such crap that its now just easier for me not to try. At least if I have no expectations I can't be disappointing right?
Has this happened to anyone else? If you asked me a couple of years ago I would have told you I would be HL for ever.

1376593931.0,1kfqot,My wife and I are in our late 30s and it's more like a business than a relationship,WhosGaryToss,42,5,35,"First off


We've been married for around ten years


Quick background on me. My last marriage ended because she was hardly ever in the mood and was very immature. I tried everything I could think of about how to make things work and get the spark back; more romance, dancing, time away, etc... I even went so far as to write her love letters and sneak them into her purse, etc... After 2 years of trying I gave in to my own needs and looked elsewhere. Yes, I cheated on her, many many times with several married women, I know I did. But that was then. And to any guys thinking about doing that, it does fuck with your head and your priorities. 


After we divorced, getting my head and priorities straightened out. 


I met my wife and about a year later we were married. This was a woman who I saw as being a great wife and mother to our kids. She had her priorities straight, had no dirty habits (smoking, drinking, drugs, etc...) and came from a nice family. Sounds perfect right? 


After about 2 years I started to see her libido go down, not her dress size or anything outward. I still desired her, still wanted her, still would do anything for her. These were all things I professed to her many many times. In the last 2 years she's lost all the weight she gained and then some, which puts her well under 150 lbs. I know this because she tells me and I listen. She looks fabulous and I'm very proud of her. I'm not too shabby myself either. I'm around 6' tall and I've had my weight issues too since we got married, but have been working out for about a year and am at a normal weight and starting to look good with my shirt off, as in there is plenty of definition in my arms, shoulders


Overall I still want to desire her, she gets uncomfortable and wants to change the subject. And on the rare occasions that she doesn't mind talking about sex, she talks about how ""real women"" don't really want to, they don't like giving a BJ, they're all uncomfortable with their bodies, they don't talk about sex or like talking about sex, they do it because their man wants it. I get it, blah blah blah... Statistics and medical journals on human sexuality say otherwise


When we go out, to which her response is typically snide, ""Well, what do you want to talk about?"". Me I'm more inclined to talk about ideas, places, concepts or our future whereas she's more inclined to discuss people or things. More often than not when we do talk it's more about the business of ""family"", kids, bills, likes me and says I'm the best thing that has ever happened to her. I mean I make her laugh


Because getting her off turns me on, she on the other hand, more often than not, doesn't take a shower or even brush her teeth before bed. That lack of personal hygiene by itself is gross and a HUGE turn off to me, so again I don't try to get anything going as a result. On the days or weekends where all the kids are gone, she would much rather lay on the couch watching shows on E! or TLC than go to the bedroom. The part that is really upsetting is that on the rare occasion that I've had to go out of town on business, she'll all of a sudden be in the mood and try to spend all afternoon in bed with me the day before. But that's the only time that ever happens. 


I've said all this to her before, being a jerk, being logical. She'll just cry and get upset. Sometimes she'll ""want to"" for a day, but most of the time it's nothing and then she'll forget that the conversation ever happened by the next day. There were a few times in the past where she'd be a little flirtatious, texting me during the day, but forget it ever happened when we get home from work. I think I have tried every plan in every book about how to get things better, bring a spark back, a friend's wedding we went to a few years back and the occasional star alignment, I'll cum, I can count on one hand the number of times since January 1st. 


We've been to therapy at my suggestion, and just moving on with life, maybe even moving out of state and living alone for a while. I say that because I know the kids need a stable environment and to turn that upside down for them or make their lives difficult in any way is not fair to them.

He will probably read this because he has been bringing up this subreddit with me recently and it makes me think that he believes we have a ""dead bedroom."" I personally do not feel that sex 1-2 times a week, I think sex is not just a physical thing or a closeness thing but it is also about his self esteem. He has low self esteem and having sex seems to be the only way to temporarily ""fix"" it. I get it but I cannot be 100% responsible for how he feels about himself. It isn't fair...that is a lot of responsibility for me! 

One more thing...how can I explain to him that when I'm doing ""mommy"" things I don't want to be sexual? If I'm standing there making a bottle, I am not in a place where I want to be groped! I tell him this and he gets offended and feels that I am rejecting him!

However last two weeks or so any time I have tried to initiate anything she has shot me down.

We never had the honeymoon period like some here. I think we averaged somewhere around once every 3 weeks until we moved in together. It gradually went from once every 3 weeks to about once every 5/6 weeks. Today

Sex

*1) She's changing. I opportunistically ""corner"" her

*2) We've turned in for the night. It's been a few weeks since our last time, I see how she reacts to the fondling. If she clams up or moves my hand, I immediately stop, wait for her to fall asleep, go into the bathroom to rub one off and then go back to bed. If she lets it continue, we have sex.

We've spoken about these issues over the past couple of years

We've been together long enough for her family &amp; friends to start throwing underhanded comments about how its time for us to get married. 7 months ago one of her siblings coworkers took it upon himself to tell me to ""Man Up"" and propose. That night we had another talk and she told me that she believed the sex issues could be worked on/fixed after marriage, i felt like a douche and we go to sleep after cuddling.

Two months ago

We established that she's reluctant about refusing my advances and is only going along due to feeling guilty about rejecting me and the gradual change in mood that she sees after weeks without sex. I say I dont want pity sex and it makes me less likely to initiate. She says she only realizes something is wrong because of my mood after a few weeks without sex

I guess my main question for DB is whether you think this situation is salvageable or if there is something else I can try? I've mentioned an open relationship

TL;DR : Girlfriend of 5 years has reached the point where she is only having sex because she feels guilty about rejecting me.

I feel devastated, again. :(",Messed_up_bedroom,46,42, but she froze and it all just happened and she had no control. Her sexual history is one of making many poor choices and having sex with strangers, but as excepted it is a double edged sword. Her past is coming out in our relationship dynamic. Fairly early on in our relationship

Turns out that she kind of froze and couldn't get it out that she was trying to get me to stop. You know those times when your lover whispers to stop, and had stopped moving inside her, but hadn't got off her. That was almost 4 years ago, and it is something that has triggered  trust issues about how men have 'needs' and the urge to get off is stronger than them listening to her. I can only assume this is related to the date rape from when she was a teen. If she firmly asked me to stop, or did any other sort of action suggesting she wanted to stop, I would of course stop. We've been through counseling to talk about it, and I thought we both realized it was a big mis-communication.

Except since then

Last night, but once in bed, I tried to touch her in hopes we could make love. Normally if she is not interested, she moves, or says to stop. She is very clear and I stop.  But last night she didn't. I continued to touch her and eventually pulled down her panjamas. I started going down on her, and thought she was warming up to me. Once again, I heard nothing

I entered her. After a minute or two of gently stroking, you are hurting me. I stopped, and and then just lied with my head on her stomach and hugged her. I didn't know she was frozen in panic. After lying there for a few minutes, kissing her tummy, she finally said 'get off me'. She got up and left the bedroom. She was distraught. 

I feel like the worst person ever. The night was very difficult and she wanted to be alone. I felt like throwing up. I've cried so many times today. I love her so much. I'd do nothing to intentionally hurt her. I just want intimacy and closeness. I can't figure out in my head if I'm simply ignoring suttle cues to stop

I don't feel that I can talk to her about my perspective of what I thought happened, shame, confusion, sadness, and that I have done this horrible thing to my lovely wife. She told me today that she wanted to remind me that she loves me. I just don't feel worthy.

* **It's accusatory** - we're saying there's a problem and it's their fault. I'm no psychologist, make them feel shame or guilt for not being satisfied. This is where we hear counter-arguments like ""Is sex that important to you? Is that all I am to you?"" It's a defense and thanks to our mostly sex-negative culture, it's a good one. Many HL's back down here and will have trouble bringing the issue up again. Issue averted.

* **Sex becomes a chore.** If sex has dropped off in the relationship chances are the LL isn't thinking about it much. Coming to the LL and saying how no sex is a problem now turns it into something they feel like they have to do. ""Uh-oh

* **No sense of importance.** We say we're unhappy during the talk. However we show the LL that we are happy by continuing to be caring, which gives our LL partners almost zero incentive to do anything about it. Again I'm no psychologist, but in my experience people tend to protect the status quo, especially if it works well for them. Why work to fix a non-existant problem?

Okay

* **Start off by assessing your LL partner's views and feelings towards sex.** Don't make it a ""the talk."" Just have a conversation about how they feel about sex and the role it plays in relationships. Specifically

* **Next communicate your views and feelings towards sex.** Once you've listened to your partner's take on sex, the feeling of being loved and desired, etc. Try to include specifics about what you want - ""I have a very high sex drive as well, so ideally for me intimacy would be 4-5 times a week. And it makes me very happy when my partner also initiates, as it shows me that I'm desireable."" Try to simply just talk about how you feel, don't direct anything towards your partner specifically. Ideally your LL partner will give you the same listening courtesy you gave them. Ideally, but as we all know the world is far from ideal and relationships can be crazy irrational at times.

* **Now talk about sex as it relates to your relationship.** With any luck by this point your partner has realized that there's a difference in how the both of you approach sex in a relationship. Acknowledge this difference, so how about we come up with an innocent sign that lets me know you'd like to have sex?""

We both went on a diet, tell me if you want me to stop"".  Finally over the summer I got suspicious and went through her email and found a bunch of sexually explicit emails of what he'd like to do to her.  I immediately confronted her with it and she downplayed it saying she shot him down (but kept his email and didn't tell me?).

Suddenly her libido came back.

She was down to fuck 3-4 times a week.  Sometimes even twice a day.  I enjoyed the attention

We started going to counselling again and the counsellor tried to convince me that the guy was 'just her best friend who happened to be male', but he came over anyway.

After that, right?

Last weekend I went away to a conference and she asked me if she minded if she went to visit some friends in Ottawa

 She came home and I asker her how the weekend went and she said ""Oh, and after pressing her, she admitted to having phone and video sex with him.

At first, but I was happy she admitted it, but then I remembered that she'd lied about her feelings towards him and that they were 'just friends', it began to eat away at me.  I asked her if that was the extent of it and I got a feeling that there's more to the story.  If there is, she isn't talking.

I packed my bags and went to my friend's house.  I've been doing some homework our counsellor gave us

We've had sex once in the last 2 months and it didn't go well, not like a husband with a loving wife.

For her side of the story

I feel like I want it to work out, despite the lying.  I'm sure there's a good person in there, she's just lost.  Of course, I could be deluding myself, but I've known her almost 10 years now and I know her pretty well.  Apparently she has a libido, and it can be unlocked, I just don't know how to do it and she's not telling me.

I'm sad because I love her for so many reasons. I'm scared because I've always been there when she needed me and I realize I have no one to lean on tonight. I'm angry because I feel like I worked my ass of since her suicide attempt and never once got the compassion and love I sought from her.

Meanwhile she would get in fights with me when I was initiating sex to the point that it would stop me in my tracks.

Then came time to have a baby as it was part of our plan and my pregnant wife, and during an epic fight about sex, she said ""I hate sex, I have always hated sex, and I never want to have sex again."" The following day I received an e-mail from her apologizing for lying to me all these years, and she admitted to creating problems in our relationship so that she could get out of sex. And she gave me a blank check to go and cheat and to have sex with whoever I wanted (we literally wrote a contract for an open marriage, I did this to take the pressure off her about having sex, as it messes with hormones

So it's been 6 months now without sex, to have sex with her, to which she agreed and when we got into the bedroom she literally started crying, and saying ""Why are you making me do this?""... and we didn't.

Furthermore it pains me to look at her cause she is absolutely stunning (9.5/10), its a cruel form of torture. I feel like I have been severely lied to and taken advantage of.

So that brings me to my question...the open marriage alternative

**EDIT; The E-mail that officially killed our bedroom:**

{throwawayinPDX}

I am sad because I feel that I have hurt you. I feel like our life together is a painful mess and I should have been more honest with you about everything before we got married. I just didn't realize that I felt the way that I do. If I knew what I knew now, I escape having to have sex. This issue has nothing to do with you and everything to do with me. I wish i could change this. I hate that I have this problem. HATE IT! However, I realize that I can't change this part of me as much as I want to. I am not sure why and will be accessing counseling to see what the root cause of this is. I just know that I can't change this part of me right now and probably not for a long time, if ever. I am ashamed to admit it, but {some friend} and I have something in common-sex is for procreation not enjoyment and I hate that this is true. 

I have been a miserable mean person to you and I feel bad. I really do. Our discussion last night has made me realize what the real issue is that it really can't be fixed. I feel a mixture of pain and relief because I am finally being honest with you and myself. I just wish I would have known all this before we got married so that way we could be on the same page and you would not feel tricked or misled. 
I am sorry for the way I am. I just can't help it. I wish I could change my inability to be sexual but I just can't. Therefore

I do ask that you please do not tell me about the women you meet

I do love you. I do want a life with you. I just can't lie to myself anymore. The clutter and chaos of construction and everything along with balancing my role as wife, teacher, housecleaner, dog walker, the list goes on and on. I have truly reached my limit and the only way I know how to deal with it is to lash out at you. I am sorry for that. It is not your fault. I know you are working as hard as you possibly can to make my/our life better. 

This email is not intended to foster pity or another discussion between us. Rather it is hopefully gain understanding and closure on an issue that has plagued both of us for the past 5-6 years.

After we had our daughter (15 months ago) sex dropped off considerably. It was a perfect storm: torn vagina

It got pretty bad for me. Maybe once a week at best, and sad. I remember once telling her that I was beginning to resent my genitals because of the way I felt. She didn't know what to do and didn't seem too inclined to seek creative solutions. I told her first that I wasn't satisfied, and second that, since she was always turning me down, I wasn't going to try any more. Rejection hurt too much. She said I could sleep with other women if I wanted and I looked at her like she had two heads. I don't want to fuck other women. I want HER.  Shortly thereafter, we had The Talk, and thank God it went well. She's a very reasonable and rational woman when the chips are down. Sex picked up for a bit, and picked up again after a lighter version of The Talk.

We started exploring our kinky side more

All of a sudden, we've had sex seven of them. The two were caused by excessive drinking by both of us the first night, and severe stomach problems on her side the next. No big deal! The sex has been great and she's way more into it than she has been in a while. 

Since our sex life has skyrocketed, and modding my truck. I'm at the top of my game right now. I'm all in on being a great dad and my daughter has been craving daddy time more and more. I feel like a fucking success on all fronts, which I haven't felt for a while. The last few months have been the best of my life by far.

My only advice to all of you before I go is to never give up on somebody you truly love as long as they love you back. It takes work but there's a huge return on investment in most cases. That said

She isn't sexually attracted to me.  I'm ""a lot sexier"" than I was a year ago, once every few months she is turned on enough that she might be receptive to sex if everything else is going right, but we all have the occasional fantasy about someone we would normally not find ourselves drawn to.

We've had the talk

My post isn't about the DB so much

Countless times I do everything for her, go there, do this and do that, and I always was fine with things until lately. Without sex, i've been finding myself almost annoyed with her, or just starting to not even really thinking of her as beyond a friend anymore. 

Its been upsetting me but i've realized I SHOULD BE HAPPY in the relationship. So the past 3 weeks i've been all about improving myself and having me time

WELL today I was asked by my gf to go over to her friends house for a house warming party! I was expecting 15 to 20 friends... only to find out its a ""help my friends move party"" and her 2 friends needed us to help them move... plus they invited 3 other people including me and my gf. I didn't want to be 1 of 5 people moving stuff into an apartment with no elevator. 

After getting the news last min today I told my gf ""would you be upset if I didn't go?"" I knew she would be, my argument is going to be in the last 2 years, i've helped her friends move 6 times, none of them helped me, none of them hardly talk to me, or think of me outside of times they need help. After a week of working lots, being sore, to move my own shit that I want to clean in my house

It may sound selfish

Am I being an ass for being a little selfish? should I have done things differently? Does she have a right to be pissed off at me?

All day I think about having sex with my wife. All day I try to think of ways I can make her attracted to me enough so she will want to have sex with me. I try to be flirty. Tell her shes sexy. Tell her shes beautiful. I do my best to be loving, so she will hopefully see that I not only enjoy our time together, but that I want to spend time with her later. Alone. Because I miss her. And then, once we finally get time alone, I feel like I can't get past her barriers. Her too tired barrier. Her not in the mood barrier. Her ill have sex if you want to have sex barrier. Partly because I fear another rejection. Or that she will give me sex because shes knows I want it, but doesn't do a good job of hiding that shes just not in the mood, but I REALLY don't want that. I am more perceptive of her moods than I think she gives me credit for. And some nights, and once we get into sex

And you know what the worst part about this situation is? When she finally tells me she wants to have sex with me and I find it hard to believe. Because there have been so many times, I instantly get horny...but then I get a little depressed. Because when it comes down to it, we just wont have sex unless I continue to press the issue all day, with sexy texts, and flirting and loving, supportive husband stuff. And its exhausting. I used to just be able to come up behind her and kiss her neck a little, or kiss her while running my hands through her hair, like we used to. But now

It hasn't changed for me though. She doesn't have to do a thing, and I will drop whatever it is I am doing and do her then and there. And I want to experience that passion from her again. But I'm at a loss as to how to do that. I seriously have no clue. So everyday, I wake up and think of ways to make her want to want to have sex with me. And today I thought I had it in the bag for sure. But the tv came on and that was that for me. I wanted to have sex, but she seemed more interested in tv. Or maybe she expected me to just pounce on her. But with the TV on I couldn't help but see that as a sign that she didn't have sex on her mind. And since all my old tricks don't work, I can't help but fear any attempt I make will just end with rejection or obligation sex. And I would rather masturbate to old videos of her than get either of those. So I just kinda wait and hope. And then things get weird and awkward. And she probably feels a bit rejected herself. But I can't get past her barriers. So we don't have sex. So we say goodnight and I masturbate thinking of her.

**Sports**
When I was a hormone crazy teenager I was also a ""no sex before marriage"" kinda guy (I have changed my opinion on that somewhat). I exercised and studied a lot as a means to keep myself occupied and ""away from temptation"".
The same approach seems to be working now. I have taken up team sports again and the time commitment as well as the post game recuperation time needed are reducing the time available a bit. I still want sex all the time but in practice there are two to three days a week in which I physically couldn't even if I had the chance. 

Another positive side effect is that I am toning my body. The have not been massive changes in my physique but the wife has come into the bathroom to ""chat"" whilst I am showering after sport a few times and stayed on staring with a half a smile after the conversation ended. I am not holding my breath that she will want to join in just yet but I see this as progress.


**Work**
I am concentrating more on work during work hours. Purposely giving it 100% during those hours means the day's go by a bit faster. One moment I am driving to work

So now I am not wound up about rejection when I get home. I might still get wound up after I get home but the amount of time I agonize over it is about 10% of what it was before. As a result I am nicer and more loving to the wife. Not that I was not nice before

**Social Life**
I am working on getting a social life. I have never been much of a social animal but I am going out with friends/family/coworkers/sports buddies  once or twice a month. I always thought pple wasted too much time planning their social calendars but it comes in handy at this time. 

Instead of sitting in front of the computer/tv all night stewing about the latest rejection I am out having a better than average time talking about nothing important. It is surprisingly refreshing.

**Sex**
I ask for it maybe once (sometimes twice) a week instead of twice a day. It is hard not to ask when I think there is an opportunity. But we have gone from every 6-8 weeks to once a month. And she has asked for it .... it had been years since the last time she asked for it!

Rejection still hurts though...

**Conclusion**
To me this is mostly about accepting that neither of us is going to change from HL to LL or visa-verse. Some might say it is me capitulating to the LL partner.  I don't know... All I know is i am happier at home and at work

Will it last/get better? Who knows. More importantly I hope it does not go back to what it was before. Time will tell.

I'm M(30) HL with F(31) LL.

We have been married for 11 years. Two boys

If you've done the math

We do love each other

However, seems satisfied most of the time with sexless companionship.

Even from very early on in the relationship, we've gone entire months without it. I don't think we ever got so bad that a year passed. But it's never been good.

And it has always been me as the initiator. I mean *always*. I cannot remember a single time we've made love that she initiated the act. Not. Fucking. Once.

I see on this sub the advice seems to be to talk about it or forget about it (i.e. leave).

In our early marriage, like, break down sobbing ""why aren't you attracted to me"" type talks. I'm not proud of those breakdowns, but I certainly didn't hide my feelings.

A few years go by with me breaking down on a regular basis

Until finally I just shut down. I withdrew emotionally. I was no longer emotionally invested in the relationship. I would sometimes think to myself

Fast forward. We're an ocean apart 11 years down the line. Still having sex maybe once a month. But it's more of an occasional attempt on my part paired with a less occasional begrudged acquiescence on her part.

Then one day... I catch her flirting with a coworker on facebook. It wasn't like ""lets fuck"" flirting though and it was mostly him that did the flirting. But clearly not completely innocent either. And I only found out after getting suspicious because she was spending so much time on her phone and wouldn't come to bed until after I was asleep (usually she was the first to go to bed).

Let me put it in context. She doesn't go out late at night. She's always home. She works in a crowded hospital. The guy is 10 years older than her, I wanted to kill myself type bad. For two days before I confronted her I didn't eat. I was a shaking fucking mess.

It was at that point I realized how much I loved her. I mean *really* loved her. I was head over heals all over again.

We talked about it. We had a really tough few weeks while I got over the jealousy part. And it has pretty much gone away. I truly am not jealous.

I changed everything about my behavior. I am helping out more with the kids. I do shit around the house a ton, but I've lost a few pounds and packed on some lean muscle). I mean, like, I fucking *changed*.

I also found rekindled desire for her.

Do you know what hasn't changed?

Yep

Even after I have had the ""why don't we have sex more often talk"" probably three times since this whole thing happened

I finally told her that if things don't change soon, or b) blowing my fucking brains out.

So it's going to have be change

She cried

That was about three weeks ago.

So

Ugh.

Last night we had the talk. When it began I really had no idea how it would end. In the week prior

I started by telling her that I was unhappy. That the physical chemistry that we once had was gone. She asked if this was about the frequency of sex. I said it was, the frustrations over our sex life had caused me to simply not care about trying. And I did that for a long time. And just in the same way that time together with someone you care about will bring you more and move in love, the reverse is also true. I told her that I didn't love her any longer.

She told me that the reason why we didn't have sex is because for women, there was a lot of lip service to our sex lives getting better, but it was always extremely short lived. I had to factor that into my decision and be honest with myself when I thought if things would actually get better in the long term.

The problem is that when it came time to say the words, and I needed some time to reflect on what was said. I told her that I needed time to think and I went to my close friends place to discuss what had happened. While there, talking about what had happened reaffirmed that I was making the right decision.

When I arrived back home

I told her that I wasn't attracted to her any longer, ""I know"". The way she said it just conveyed everything about the relationship. We had talked about this situation many times in the past. There were many chances to fix things, but for whatever reason they were ignored. To me, ""I know"", just felt like her finally realizing the gravity of what was going on. 

She then said that she didn't want this to destroy things with our friends. I agreed, and that we don't click as a couple, but that I still respect her as a person.

How do you ask a woman to sleep with you when there's no chance of a relationship?  I never figured it out -- and I certainly never told my friend

I had forgot what sex was like, instead of rolling away with a snarl and a sneer.

But she tells me.  She said later she had never told anyone this but for whatever reason decided to tell me.  She explained that after her husband and daughter had been killed in a car accident, for money or *pro bono*, in the three years.

Before coming to this subreddit, I didn't even know a woman could get aroused.  I've always been the initiator, the HL.  I couldn't tell you how many times I've been told ""You're just a guy.""  ""It's a guy thing."" ""You're just like every guy out there."" or ""Real women aren't like that."" ""Normal women don't behave like that."" ""Real women don't think like that.""  Especially when a HL woman would be portrayed on TV or in the movies.  I know they're just actresses in a fictional role

""You just need it because you're a guy!"" is still one that burns me to the core.  I'm a human freaking being!  I have feelings and emotions too!  I'm not a walking penis.  I have a brain and a heart.  I'm not looking for meaningless sex.  I want a mutually loving, just more than a couple of times a year and not to have it be awkward and uncomfortable as SO just lies there, hoping I'm quick.

To always feel ashamed of who you are, well...let's just say it hasn't done wonders either.

Until now I had no idea that it was possible for a woman to even think or feel the same way as me.  I'm happy to find out that I was right, I wish us both luck.  If nothing else, at least I feel vindicated in the knowledge that it's not just a ""guy thing"", but a ""human thing"".  I wish my SO had friends like you, to tell her this fact.  But I'm sure she would either deny facts as fiction, or just not listen all together, as many of her friends have already told her that they dislike sex as well.

It's just nice to know I'm not alone.",,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1kka8s/to_all_the_hlfs_out_there/
1376386991.0,1k9p6m,I (31m) want to someday send this to my wife (30f),WhoIsJohnSalt,38,8,32,"I don't know why it's so hard to try and start this conversation. We seem to have pretty good communication in all other areas of our lives

We've been married now for three years, but it does feel like we've got our shit together. 

I'm also aware that (I hope) that I'm doing a better job of being a husband to you than I ever did as just your boyfriend. I don't know what caused the change, to be better around the house, to stop doing the things that annoy or upset you, to take much better care of myself to make sure we've got the best shot at a long future together. As you've said - I've changed, and I think it's for the better (and I think you do too). Of course there's always room to improve, and I'm going to make sure I do that.

I think that we've got a good relationship

But there's the elephant in the room, talk about. I don't know why, but that communication hurdle has always been there, looking back, pretty much from day 1, all those years ago.

It's sex, new jobs, new projects - and probably much of that is my fault, but now life is more stable I can see that there's a gap there - has always been there. 

It's not that I want there to be more of it (ha! ""it"" - FFS still mentally blocking around it, sex - there I said it!) - though I do - but that because we've neglected that area of our lives for so long, it feels ""not right"" sometimes, if that makes sense? I don't get the sense that we are comfortable with each other in the bedroom, that we don't each other's boundaries, desires, wants or turn-ons. While we have been having more sex recently it's almost as if every time is the first time

I don't know what it is - if there is a root cause, or something else entirely. You've very lightly hinted in the past there might be something else in there? Perhaps these are all things we need to talk about? 

But of course I've noticed some reticence at certain times - the one which really sticks in my mind was when we were in the hotel for our anniversary this year. We'd been kissing, still kissing you and then, as it became more heated, you grabbed the hotel phone next to the bed and started reading the list of numbers on it! That really threw me and that's part of what's got me confused. 

Men are pretty simple creatures, holding hands when we walk anywhere, your legs up on me when we watch the TV, or even your arm over me when you sleep, snoring gently into my shoulder. All those things make me feel closer to you. So when something like the hotel pops up it's a real blow - and it starts of a chain of thoughts (every time!), ""Does she not love me?"", ""does she not find me attractive?"", ""when we do have sex, and suspicion sets in - if we do have sex

I'll put my cards on the table - I think sex is a cornerstone of a good relationship and marriage. It's very important to me - and in my mind it's what separates a relationship between a couple and close friends sharing a house together. I also think that if this isn't something we address - explicitly, me approaching at what might be the wrong time, or in the wrong way, and you feeling pressured or unhappy because of it.

And I'm not here to ask for our lives to be like a porn film, for me to know you better. For us to explore each other, get used to being together that way, so that it becomes the default rather than the exception - for sex to become a core part of our lives rather than something that just happens around it on occasion.

I know this is probably a lot to take in - that making the next steps seem hard - how do we even start this conversation

I love you

1373953411.0,1ie91w,I think my gf unwittingly conditioned me to be LL...,SpectralTrigger,39,4,20,"I know the title seems inflamatory

About four years, because we both secretly had a crush on the other for the month leading up to our accidental make-out session (real talk: booze may have been involved). Anyway, we exchanged ""I love you""s about three months in, and the first time I got her shirt off was by the four month mark. For me, this was VERY slow (I was 20 by this point and had been having consistent sex since I was 14, usually by the one month mark of every previous relationship) but I didn't mind because I really loved being with her. Besides, she is very religious and she was apprehensive about getting too physical. In fact

Anyway, we got all the way from barely 2nd to rounding home. I could almost SEE the religious guilt kick in, because even though she initiated us ""trying"" for the first time, not even part of the head was in before she started crying and asked if I would be okay stopping. I said of course, and felt like a horrible asshole for a week (then she smacked me on the head and told me it was mostly her fault and to stop worrying). Anyway, that seemingly broke a barrier and we went from nothing to getting each other off (orally or by hand) almost every other day, sometimes multiple times a day.

Sure there were times I would get frustrated and wish we could have sex, about 2 years in, she started talking about us trying to have sex again. We bought lube and every now and then, during a very long and steamy session, would start getting ready to try. But each time, without fail, she would start to shake or whimper when I was about to penetrate. She promised me that there was no trauma or anything, but every now and then she would still want to try.

About a year and half of this happening at least once or twice a month, I would have trouble getting back in the mood. I was really embarrassed by this and would try to pass it off by saying ""Don't worry about me, I just want to do you today!"" It also didn't help that my girlfriend gets SUPER tired after an orgasm and is usually too exhausted to realize that I didn't remove any clothing.

 Then, she would show clear displeasure and go through with the oral/handjob with as little enthusiasm as possible. She still grabs me in public and does things to turn me on all the time, and loves when I do things for her like fingering her while we're in public or getting her off wherever the mood strikes, but as soon as I'm hard and out, she starts to taper off and most of the time it just ends with me finding some excuse to stop contact because I can't take a second more of that bored, distant expression on her face. (btw, I'm always very enthusiastic when it comes to her, and like a dumb cartoon character who always falls for the same trap

Lately, I try to find ways to delay a trip to the bedroom. Even though I act enthused and turned on, inside my head is this ongoing chorus of ""UGH I don't want to do this... I just want to keep watching the movie. Hopefully it won't take very long..."" I just want to get her off and be done with it. Sometimes, I don't even get fully hard; I just feel like I'm doing a duty. 

I went from relationships where I had sex multiple times a day every day (My record was 4 straight months of sex every day with a previous paramore, trying to get off while she sits there limp-wristing me (or if she gets bored enough, she'll just tell me to use her legs as an aid while she stares off into space), or get cried off of her for the umpteenth time. I don't watch porn or masturbate anymore (I think the last time I got off was about a month ago). I feel so passionless and unhappy right now.

Long story shortened, i do want kids but i have said in the past we need to 'fix our sex' before children.  Didn't happen.

I wanted it to be a natural 'oops' conception and she was ok with that at first.  The first month wasn't too shabby.  She was more interested in sex but not for any real intimate or sexual reasons.  But, won't touch me or kiss me or do anything to make this enjoyable for me - i was the solely responsible to make sure i was hard.  I mentioned that this wasn't fun for me and that got me a pity over-the-underwear light touch on my dick.  Which, btw was freeking torture, my mind screaming DONT STOP.

Looking back it was fucking terrible.  Early into it I started to resent it even though i participated in it.  ""At least i am getting laid right?"" was how i tried to make myself feel better.  It didn't work.  Every single time it happened i was isolated, and *feeling like i had no choice*.  

Now I am relieved it's over, now I am avoiding all of the arousal-triggers with my wife out of fear of facing those depressing feelings again.  Which is just making me more distant and likely compounding the problem.

I think it's partly due to your depression. Partly due to the fact that I think you still have a lot of sexual self-discovery to do. Partly due to the fact that I haven't asserted my own desires and needs enough in a relationship. Partly because I'm too tolerant, as much as i've tried to communicate it.

I had a bit of hope when we had sex twice in one day the other week. That hope lingered for about a week. It's started to fade since.

I read a post on /r/deadbedrooms

It kinda rang true to me

It isn't the fundamentally fact that we aren't having sex that bothers me… It's the fact that things do not seem to be changing

I told you that us having a healthy sex life that was enjoyable for both of us was really important to me, and passionatel. I know sex has been painful for you at times. That fucking sucks and I imagine is awful for you, and understandable that it makes you want it a lot less. But it has an impact on me too - you not wanting sex means I am left sexually unsatisfied. Us being in a committed monogamous relationship means that I remain sexually unsatisfied.

So I tried to talk to you about ideas to either get our libidos closer in sync

That was about two months before the date of that aforementioned conversation. So I asked if you could call the hospital and follow up on it. You said you would. I felt this was the smallest thing you could do to show you are committed to improving our sex life, and fulfilling.

I waited six days - and you hadn't said anything. So I asked if you had, like a lot of other reasons you've made in regard to our sex life, did not strike me as true or honest. When I said I didn't think that was the reason, you acted like I was being unreasonable and got upset at me and told me that it was hard for you to make that call and that it wasn't enough time. I was frustrated because you didn't keep your word and I thought this would be a recurring thing of you dodging what you said you would do because it was uncomfortable. 

…and I was right, you still haven't made that call. I messaged you thirty minutes ago, and you haven't replied. You've probably read that message, you've probably felt uncomfortable at it and ignored it and hoped it would just go away along with your guilt. You'll probably tell me you can't tomorrow because of work (nevermind that you finish at 4:30pm and you can call them after) and that you'll call them Wednesday. Wednesday will come around and if I try and follow up with you, you will get defensive and upset at me again. Thursday is our one year anniversary and I will probably put any resentment aside just so I, and you, can share a nice day together. I'm still looking forward to spending a nice day with you

I thought I was the only schlub with this problem.  One day of reading posts and comments and my future is set.  G_d bless each and every one of us!

For what it is worth, fighting over kids and furniture, yadda yadda.  Everyone that ever said we were going to Hell for not being married or we were losers came back around to say how lucky we were for not being married. Honestly, because we were not married always kept me on my best behavior, but also actively interested in my SO well being.  Probably the first 5 yrs were terrific sexually- maybe until around the time(s) I proposed.  After that (in hindsight) our relationship became more about traveling and eating.  Over time you just get in a routine.  I probably did not want to have sex as much as she did not want to have sex.  Maybe once a month, but also there were times when it was several months between sexual outings.  

Maybe 6 years ago we made a big decision.  I basically left my banking career so she could pursue her career.  We moved to an isolated area with few opportunities for me, I struggled to keep my financial independence.  During this time she had some serious medical issues and I eventually liquidated my savings and retirement to meet those needs.  Again, I don't think I have any regrets in that.  During that time though, our sex life got worse, but again how can you ""force"" a ""sick"" person to have sex with you.  You don't even go there.  But it's also in this time that I started talking seriously about having kids - you start to feel your mortality. She says to this day she does too, but you have to have some sex to have kids.  It's almost like being sick was an excuse to avoid sex to avoid children.  Then she talks about getting married so we can adopt.  After all of this I don't think I am going to fall into that trap.  Anywho, we emerge from all that

I was near penniless being underemployed for so long.  All attempts to get a well paying job at my partner's local office have failed largely because my partner is not much of an advocate for me at her place of work.  I can take a lot

I think the first warning sign was the introduction of the ""cuddle pillow, she must be a lesbian.  Heck, maybe they are all true.  She has been to counseling over the years - lots of ""mom"" stuff to work on.  She's been on anti-depressants.  I have offered to go to counseling, but it seems that she just does not want me in that space.  

I lost almost 50 pounds in the last year

Now she is getting nervous, but I can't do it to my detriment.  This is survival.

Frankly

I just wanted to drop in and say hi to all of you. I dealt with a DedBedroom marriage for 17 years; issues started almost immediately after marriage. I was in perfect physical condition (was a soldier), and the sex went from terrible to non-existent within the first 3 years of marriage. 

Over time the emotional damage that was done to me by the constant rejection, my confidence, (My ex-wife used to tell me that my penis was too small (7.75in) to get her off, and a whole host of other deflections that made it my fault) It just crushed me. A slow but steady degrading, which over time I started to believe completely. I gave up, not just on sex, but on happiness. 

I got fat, mean. I was just so angry and full of resentment, I was miserable, but I loved my ex-wife while we were married. I was emotionally manipulated into always trying to make her happy just for a scrap of affection, or sexual contact. I thought the world of her, and would of never left her. (crazy i know)

Eventually she cheated, got my confidence back, got my physical health back, met a great girl, and finally have a great Marriage. 

To this day I still have some issues left over from my DB experience; I am very touchy about my wife's sexual past, and I am SUPER sensitive to any form of rejection.... a simple ""Can we make love in the morning babes, I am just wiped out from my day at work"" (She always makes good on it) feels like I knife in the heart at times.... but my general happiness, my level of connection with my wife, my satisfaction with life is so much better, I honestly didn't know life could be this great.

I tell all of you this because there IS life after DB. There is hope, if your DB partner is un-willing, leave, take responsibility for your own needs and happiness and get out there and find it. Life is too short to live that way.

My post was the typical ""Married for a few years with a three kids

The pattern was the same up until a few weeks ago. My wife and I attended a friend's destination wedding down in the Caribbean for an extended weekend vacation; our first vacation without kids in 5 years. Just the two of us; no kids

When my in-laws dropped us off at the airport to depart it was like a weight lifted off our shoulders instantly. We talked to each other differently

Fast forward to two days into the trip and we are back in our room after a full day of drinks and sun on the beach, I walk over and tell her we're going to be late and give her just a quick, random kiss on the lips. As I pull away we make eye contact, I kiss her again and BOOM! 

We haven't had sex like that in years

We missed dinner completely and ended up reshowering and catching up to the group later that night. Sex a couple more times on the trip and a few times since the trip and we're a completely different couple

We've talked and both decided that it's absolutely necessary for us to take a true break from the kids at least once a year for even just one weekend

We've also decided that we're absolutely done having kids and plan on making it truly permanent soon. After our third kid she wanted to wait for a little while yet because she was indecisive as to how many kids she really wanted. We've always tossed around the 3 and 4 numbers. I've been ready to throw in the towel after a few months with three in the house

She admitted that even with an IUD she was still quite nervous about getting pregnant again

My bf and I have been together for two years now. Same old story - we had lots of sex in the beginning and it was awesome! Then along the way I changed jobs and had a shitty schedule for a while so the sex dropped a bit, and I'm sure you all can guess what happened next. His libido *completely* tanked. I tried to be patient, because I care about him and his mental health is important. After about a month of absolutely no sex I finally couldn't take it anymore and I let on how frustrated I was getting. He hadn't even realized it had been a month.

The talk didn't really resolve anything other than him being sorry, basically.

Finally he goes off his antidepressants and his libido slowly starts to return! *Huzzah!* However, it sucks, but I figure we just keep at it and eventually things will return to normal! I'm honestly not that bothered by it, and I'm just happy we're doing it again. 

But no, and I tell him this. He gets all weird about it anyway and harshly tells me that if I want to buy a vibrator I should just go do that with my girlfriends and he doesn't see why he needs to buy it with me. He obviously just doesn't want to talk about it at all so I give up.

I should also mention that we have both been experiencing a lot of stress for the past couple months

We've only had sex a handful of times this year. I haven't had an orgasm that wasn't self-induced for at least two months, so when I've tried to talk about it all I hear is stuff like; ""What, you guys haven't had sex in HOW long? Man, I would be sooo frustrated!"" and every time I hear something like that it makes me feel even more lonely.


The worst part is? This isn't my first dead bedroom. My ex boyfriend of 9 months was my first and only sexual partner


So basically, enjoyable sex life. I've had a high libido ever since I was a teenager, and used to dream of all the wonderful sex I would have one day. Now I'm turning 23 in a month and I'm starting to feel afraid that things will never improve, and as I get older my libido will drop without me ever getting to experience that joy. That's probably one of my biggest fears right now.

I am so, but it seems like he just gets discourages or some new stress in life comes up and then he gives up again... and the bitterness just grows and grows. I can't help but think every time I go to masturbate that he just doesn't care about my pleasure. He's said that he does and it seemed like he meant it, but then I think well, you obviously don't care enough or you'd be fucking *doing* something about it. It feels like he's just avoiding the problem because of his own feelings of shame or whatever, and I am running out of sympathy. It's not like I'm begging for sex every other day - I've *barely* mentioned it. I've been extremely patient. So why can't he just be selfless, go out and buy a vibrator and use it on me? I am the type of person who if the roles were reversed would be pleasuring my bf in other ways, even if I wasn't in the mood for sex. (In fact

1372666184.0,1heyv9,An interesting reaction,marriedscoundrel,42,11,17,"So my wife and I are working towards improvement. Last month we average about 3 times a week. Considering we used to have 2-3 month dry spells at a time this is pretty huge. 

The other night I was on the computer and my wife caught me looking at porn. (The ironic part - I was only looking at it to delete it. As many of you may know I've been working on giving up porn). She was disturbed by this - back in our heyday she was never bothered by porn. We used to watch it together. I asked what was wrong - she said that she had been working on changing and felt like she'd made good progress

...Let me explain. I told her that while I was thrilled about the progress we'd been making

The next day we were all over each other

The following day no sex (which was fine by me), make her want to do it. She gave me a short list of conditions I would have to fulfill for her to consider it. I said I would do what I could to create an ideal environment for her, but I pointed out that this wasn't exactly fair - I didn't have a list of conditions for her, wasn't holding her to the same standard. She started to get defensive and accused me of only caring about sex and our talks lately revolving around sex. I called her on that - right now our only issue is sex so if that's solved then it won't come up. And we'd gone the entire weekend talking about all sorts of things - it was only here at the very end that we talked about sex. And if you want me to be happy with you, you have to step up to the plate. I told her I would not press the issue any further, but she's an adult and I've made my position clear. 

So we'll see what happens from here. My reason for sharing this story - I think the time for walking on eggshells with our LL partners is past. We need to be direct, look them in the eye and say ""yes, yes it is."" If they start getting insecure and mopey about not being good enough, don't coddle them. Say ""no, you're not.

Here are the basics: I am 35 and my wife and I have three young kids (4.5

Our sex life slowed down after the birth of our first two, I don't approach her for at least 3 months and things ususally pick up after 6 months (once a week which is a less than I wanted, but would love that now).  Well, no so much with the youngest.  We have sex once a month and it is total pity sex (which is really depressing).  

Let's face it; 3 kids under the age of 5 is really intense and she is REALLY tired at the end of the day.  I totally get that.   That being said

A few other things to help frame the situation:
1) My wife is gorgeous.  Hot!  You would never believe she has three children.  I would jump her bones every day if I could.  She feels secure in her body and I am in good shape (i.e. I am still the same weight and build from when we ment) so I think she should still be realatively attracted to me.
2) This is not just about sex.  I masturbate if I need to
3) It is like her sex drive has completley shut off.  I cannot get her interested in any way.  Sorry to get graphic
4)  We have talked about it and she blames it on being tired.  At first, I turned it to me (it must be my fault).   She recommended I do things to help her relax, make it special, etc.   I turned it up a notch for a few months.  I would take all three kids when I got home from work, bathe them and get them put to bed while she relaxed and drank a glass of wine and did emails, etc.  I would give her massages and not try to make a move on her (very hard by the way) to show that it is not just about sex.   Despite all of this, it has just gotten worse.

So here is my basic question: Am I just being an impatient prick? It has only been 10 months since our third child.  Will she bounce back once the kids are a little older?  How often is reasonable for people in our situation?  I don't even know what normal is

Help!! I need some good advice.

I decided that i had enuff and that I held a lot of responsibility for the situation so i began to change-here's a few things i did to restart things. I began to look at my wife as a sexual being-I started to notice her body and started to change my self talk from-shes a mother to shes a sexy lady. I then began to show her i thought she was sexy by chasing her again-i'd walk up and stroke her often-kiss the back of her neck

I then began to lust after her and would tell her god i think you're so sexy-do you know i have even taken your panties from the wash and played with them cause i find you so attractive and sexy-(she found this very flattering and sexy-i'd even let her catch me with them and that turned into one of the best fulfilled fantasies ever) 

We then began to go to sex stores to buy nice outfits and some toys (the investment that keeps on giving). I asked her to leave me her panties once in awhile and it's always very sexy to find a pair on my pillow. 

Well she started warming up and now i have awoken the beast lol-we have the best times of our lifes now-we tell each other things we never would have ever thought to talk about-we discuss fantasies and we role play. 

I realized it took stopping my internal complaining about her and our situation and changing it to positive self talk that started my journey. It has been incredibly rewarding-she has come full circle as have I-I lust after her constantly and she will sometimes come home at lunch just to jump me and play-or she'll attack me in the funniest places. I think that instead of becoming complacent with the situation you have to become that ""take charge kind of guy"" she met and just start communicating and the hell with what happens-we get too worried about weather or not our partners will think we are perverted or stupid-if you step out on that ledge either she will push you off or she will pull you back-either way you will know where you stand.

We were happy.  Physically we were good and affectionate.  We talked, I realized I didn't know how to raise them in the city.  Because I'd given so many years to her to live where she wanted, I approached her about moving outside the city.  We talked, and she agreed that we could start looking.

I realize that makes her sound bad, good person.  I just don't think she ever had been asked to consider someone else's interests instead of her own.  For instance, she told me, after the arguments began, that she always simply had thought that I wanted what she wanted.

Anyway, but she did not.  She said every kind of vicious thing imaginable.  I think this was because, as I say, she never had been confronted with her own fundamental selfishness before.  

It was as though she blamed me for being hurt by her disinterest in what I might want.  And, I was the one who'd changed the terms on her.  I was the one who'd asked to move out of the city.

But she also said other things. For example, that I would want alimony from her.  This made me realize that all the years in which I'd struggled to get my career started, struggles I'd faced because I'd given up on my job so many years ago in an attempt to make her happy, she'd viewed me merely as a sponge.  She hadn't seen sacrifice.  She'd seen an underpaid apparently valueless companion who wanted her to support him.  

Which isn't to say anything bad about alimony; it's a useful tool for certain spouses.  But accepting it would have been the furthest thing from who I was.  That realization, made me realize what I said above about my being important to her only to the extent that I let her follow her dreams.  It also was the exact moment at which I felt my love for her die.

We have been together for *years* since then.  We don't argue.  We're civil for the most part to each other.  We talk about our children and the many tactical details of filling their needs.  We don't touch.  We don't kiss.  We don't say I love you.  We haven't had sex in almost 4 years.  We pour our emotions into our relationships with our children.

Truthfully I can't imagine how we'll ever get from where we are now to where we might be intimate--physically or emotionally--again.  But then I couldn't have imagined before all of this happened that my simple desire to move out of the city would have caused this kind of rift.

We stay together, I know, that's not a good reason.  For what it's worth, I do believe it some day would be a surprise to them to learn about what has happened.  Many parents are not that affectionate in front of their children.  We have masked it well.  

But also, during this, asked myself if I were the kind of person who kept my promises or not.  I know what my answer is.

I have left some out

But I don't see how how anything I did during all of this was wrong.  I tried hard in every instance to do the right thing, sacrifice.  But at this point it's not a question of blame.  It's a question of how to continue in the years I have left with an emotional void in my heart.

Anyway

Then I brought it up

A month or two later, fighting here and there. I was convinced she was cheating on me, that she didn't want sex with me because she was having it with someone else, so I became paranoid.

I tried all kinds of things: I gained 10-15lbs of upper body muscle, not talking about it, being romantic and spontaneous, attempting to initiate it, never attempting. Nothing ever helped, it only got worse.  She never told me how she felt or what was wrong except one drunken fight where she just said 'I don't want to have sex with you.'  But we were drunk so I try not to put too much into that.

Anyway, in our own motel for a week, it should be a love fest, right? Here she's conceding some guilty feeling sex. It feels obligatory. She's very distant, and I return to the height of my paranoia about her cheating on me, so I look at her phone.

I see that she's texting and calling this guy from her university whenever I'm out of the room or asleep. He's totally her type too: brown hair, blah blah. Anyway it's heartbreaking but I don't bring it up until we're back home.  She basically just says that she's sorry for hurting me, but nothing affirmative about her not having feelings for this guy.

At this point I decide that I'm not going to let myself continue being this paranoid, just that I want more intimacy. So we have another talk and I tell her that she has to work with me to solve this or tell me that we're just simply physically incompatible. 

Next day she tells me that she had in fact been intimate with this other guy

Definitions:

Natural arousal interval - The time it takes for a person to become receptive to the idea of sex but not necessarily seek it out.  This assumes there are no external issues causing low libido.

Maximum tolerable interval - The absolute longest we're willing to go without sex with our partners.  This is subjective for the most part.

So how do we know if our expectations of our partners are reasonable?   If our maximum tolerable interval is is shorter than our partner's natural arousal interval

As you can imagine, we were just different people with different needs. I could not see myself being happy with her twenty or thirty years from now if nothing changed. And how could I expect it to change? I had done everything within my power to improve the relationship, to the point of proposing to her. Eventually I realized that if moving in together didn't change anything, getting engaged didn't change anything, why would getting married be any different? 

I understand that relationships are never perfect, I learned that no-sex relationships are not one partner's fault; rather, both partners are at fault. We had been in a vicious cycle of me wanting sex so badly, her feeling pressured, her giving me pity sex, me feeling awful about it. So I would stop pressuring her, lay off completely, until it was obvious that I wanted it

So I ended it. It was a very difficult decision, is that I let the relationship go on for so long, knowing in my heart it was wrong. My lack of strength to leave earlier in the relationship lead to something that simply went too far. I hurt her very deeply, and this is the hardest thing for me, because she is an incredible person, and I've ruined her.

To those of you who are considering leaving your relationships because of this, single women out there. I went on a date this week, got drunk, got molested by her at the bar, went to her place, fooled around. No sex. She slept topless and kept taking my hands and putting them on her breasts throughout the night. After being rejected for so long, I could not believe that there were women out there that wanted me. And that is a great feeling. It was a fun experience at the time, and it made me realize how special my relationship was. So that's where I am right now.

I was raised in a religious family, however now trying to get back in. A couple of rough years being bullied around this time, further settled my self-image of not being welcome in the group.

After moving out, but after just a little while, her will for sex dried up. There were medical reasons involved, but to this day I can't help but wonder if my eagerness to be ""normal"" through sex caused some of it. After a year or so, I learned to cope with the lack of sexual validation by shoving my feelings aside. I decided that I wanted to be with her, even if it meant to give up a working sex life. We distanced ourselves from each other sexually, and had a good life together despite -- or maybe thanks to -- this.

Ten years and two kids (very planned, and I think we'll sort it out. Unfortunately my old feelings of inadequacy and of being left outside has returned. For example, if there is a sex scene in a movie and I see my wife smiling, my mind says ""Oh, so sex makes you happy -- only not with me?"". When she jokes around with her friends on the topic, I feel similarly. Rejection if I make a move is probably the worst, so to protect myself I usually don't take any initiative.

I guess my feelings are close to jealousy, rather than at her. Rationally, I am all for fantasies and a liberated view on sex. Emotionally, I feel like a pathetic, immature wreck.

My ex-wife (34F) and I (37M) suffered from a DB for the last 3 years of our 7.5 year marriage.  After 2 kids and settling into the domestic life she seemed to lose all sexual interest (in me at least).  We tried counseling but in the end she seemed to just get more apathetic toward me and increasingly pissed off about my “preoccupation” with our nonexistent sex life.  The final straw was when she told me that if I was so unhappy

A little over 2 years later, I’ve been sober for a year and half, I get to see my kids almost every weekend and best of all I’m involved with a woman that wants to make love to me.  It’s not ideal but I believe I’m at a place in my life that I think I can learn to be happy again.

By default, potential partners.  It turns out she did meet an older, very wealthy, successful guy who, after announcing their engagement, she moved in with about nine months ago and proceeded to sell our very nice 4 bed, 3 bath house in the suburbs.  She and the kids live in his goddamn mansion while I’m stuck in a two bedroom apartment by myself.  It is pretty hard to take but I’m dealing with it.  She’s living the dream so fuck me

Well things are not always as they seem.  My wife’s fiancé is a complete and utter control freak.  He will not allow me to pick up the kids from her unless he is present.  This has been a huge source of frustration for me since it makes picking them up a scheduling nightmare.  From what I learned through the kids and by my own observations I could tell that he was the very possessive, unfortunately, was not apparent to my wife until after she moved in with him.

So, of course, he had to be there.  She surprised me by inviting me to come on over and get them anyway.  This was very unusual because she has never been particularly accommodating when it comes to me picking up the kids but even more so because this defied one of his rules.  Of course I couldn't give a fuck about his rules and I wanted to see my kids so off I went.  

When I showed up to the mansion, trust and respect we once shared as partners, parents and lovers.

This was the woman I loved… the woman I have always loved.  I was so confused.  I was filled with dread, she had me wait in my car when she went and got the kids so it would appear that I had just arrived to pick them up.  She acts like she is scared shitless of this guy and it breaks my heart.

To say that my bedroom is dead would be I feel a misnomer; it is in fact my marriage that is dead. What life remains

I am a very introspective person. I look to actions not words for the meaning of things. My marriage was not always like this game of avoidance I have now and I know that we both have had our parts to play in this tragedy.

I have been married over fifteen years and I am 35, but maybe someone will take that to heart. My reasons for this are simple. In you mid 20’s you are just now experiencing life for the first time really. You are free from the watchful eyes of your parents. Freedom at this age is unlike anything at any other time. I think you spend the rest of your life longing for and in search of this freedom. To get married now to deny this from yourself and from that you will plant the seeds of regret and regret as the saying goes is a bitch.
I have always been shy around women, that while inebriated that I finally found the courage to speak to whom would become my wife. She too was shy, but the alcohol was having a similar effect for her apparently. We talked and seemingly clicked. We lost our virginity to one another within a week. 

She was in college and only in town for the week, I proposed. The first time we spent any significant time together was after we were married. 

I mention our early relationship to paint the picture. I can identify my failings and I can draw inferences for hers.

Our failings in this, is that dating is going out to eat and I think hers is much the same. Only recently, past year or so, have I actually started to learn that dating is so much more than that. It is spending time with someone else and they being your center of attention during that time and you being theirs.  It is exploring each other’s personality and every other aspect of them. I feel now that I went from step 1 to step 10 and skipped everything in between. The most important things that I can think of that we skipped were building up mutual trust and the ability to be open and honest with each other. I think nearly all of our issues now can be traced back to having never laid the foundations for this. We as a couple never went through these critical steps.

Another failing of mine, the last thing my mother would have heard from him was I love you. I think that exemplifies how two people in love should behave. They were open about sex and discussed it freely; it wasn’t something to be ashamed about. Now, no one was running around naked mind you because they also taught modesty, but they taught my siblings and me to communicate. My father encouraged us to challenge beliefs, why did we think the way we did, to change our thoughts on something as we learned more about it. I credit my father alone for the way I critically evaluate everything.

My wife’s family, polar opposite really. If my family was the positive end of a magnet hers would be the negative. In the fifteen plus years I have been around them, I think I have seen her parents hold hands less than ten times, much less kiss. I cannot recall a time that I have ever heard either one utter, “I love you”. My take away from this, is that her family repressed everything that my family lifted up and embraced. I like her family. They are nice people, just not affectionate or loving. Discussions center around small talk, weather

So not only did my wife and I never learn to communicate
I find other aspects of my wife’s personality need mentioning. She is smart, someplace that doesn’t require her to think or interact with others. Actually, she has stated she wants to be a librarian, not sure how she reconciles that in her head with the people interaction though. Her current job involves a lot of daily interaction with others. She hates office politics and brings home this anger she feels of someone getting something they didn’t earn or deserve. I’ve long since stopped asking about work. I’d sooner ask her to join a satanic cult. I’ve encouraged her to pursue her master’s degree in library science. This is required for librarian jobs. She can’t, to busy, we don’t have the money, and now doesn’t want to.

I think I have summed up our personalities, if I get horny I will look to find some tits and ass. If not in the flesh, I will find it virtually to rub one out. I still look I admit, but not like then. I can now go weeks without it/ not thinking of it. I have found it easier to ignore it than be reminded of what I am missing. What I should have seen then was how she handled it. She stopped talking to me for days. This is a pattern that she has continued to this day.

Her friend moves back months later and wants the house back, it felt like another honeymoon. In fact it probably was since we had been with our parents like we were. Sex was more spontaneous, we were affectionate. It was bliss. As we are approaching the five year mark, we start to talk children and our salaries have improved. With my veteran status, we found and purchased a home. At the one year mark in the home, we brought home our first child. It was around her birth that the change really started or was apparent. I wondered then and still wonder now if my wife suffered/suffers from postpartum depression. I have asked for her to talk to someone, but have always gotten resistance to it. 

I do not really recall her snapping at me prior. Sure we had fights, just not tonight, etc. All the usual excuses. What we did have in the beginning seemed like Cirque du Soleil compared to what we do now. 

Since child #1 had been born I have been going to school at night. 2-3 nights out of the week from when the eldest was 6 months old and until year 13 of our marriage nearly early every semester I worked on my bachelor’s degree. My sleep patterns changed; even now three years since I graduated I have problems falling asleep prior to 10 at night. I started school in part because of my daughter. It was standing there in the delivery room that I realized I had to do more than what I was doing now to provide a good life for her. Looking back now

The past three years since I have graduated have been the absolute worse in the marriage.  We have a crying what’s wrong with our marriage talk with increasing frequency. Last one was this past February. Sex life is nonexistent. Once or twice every three to four months. 

I used to randomly send flowers to her at work, not like they could change anything.” I stopped sending them after that.   I used to be the guy that warmed towels in the dryer while she was in the shower. According to her I was just trying to see her naked. Write “I Love you” on the mirror with the oil from your finger (Only shows when the room gets steamy.) and I was smudging it up. My degree I worked so hard on so I could be an example for my daughter, she pissed on. Not literally mind you, but figuratively. She complained when I said I wanted her there. I graduated as my daughter went to spend the night with a friend. I used to by her sexy underwear and sexy outfits to wear, Victoria Secret stuff. She doesn’t wear any of it. I have bought her plain Hanes packs and she complained about the patterns or lack thereof. The past three or four Christmases I have bought her Disney themed pajama sets. I went for as unsexy as I could get.. She wears those. Long gone are the passing touches, I can’t recall the last passionate kiss I have gotten, a simple non-prompted “I love you” is too difficult for her to say.  We have gone on two cruises, and spent the majority of the time in the cabin. Which would be nice if the obvious was happening

During previous talks she complained I do nothing to help her around the house. I was helping, she will come stomping in with her jaw fixed just so. If I ask what is for dinner and can I help, I am told she’s got it. I do cook on the weekends though, according to her that’s my time. She’s complained that I never tell her what I want to eat. Hell I am a guy, as long as it is not moving and still warm it’s a meal. I found a site called eMeals.com. Wonderful site. They send you a list of seven dinners and a shopping list. Showed the wife and she turned her nose up, expensive ingredients, hate that type of food

I sit here typing, they have given me a breath of fresh air that I have needed.

I can see the next talk will be in the next few months ahead I will say I want a divorce then and I will be prepared. I fix things for a living. I am told I am rather good at what I do. I have tried fixing our relationship and have failed. My conclusion is that it is not broken from her stand point and my efforts are not needed.

I have been wearing sexy bras, and it's just getting worse every week. Last time we had sex was because I ended up having enough and telling him everything I though about us not having sex.

We've (I'm 30, married for two. One child, 3 years old.

I consider myself to have quite a high libido
**For me it makes me feel close to my wife

When we were dating

We moved in together, but I want to note that I'm pretty sure the lack of sex is not related to having a child. He's great he goes to sleep at 19:30, and he's asleep until the next morning. 

It's not like either of us are constantly up taking care of him

I'm always(99% of the time - in 6 years

Nearly every time I try to initiate it

I felt frustrated and hurt.

She didn't even appear to notice. I actually asked her ""have you noticed I'm not trying to have sex with you?""

We sat down and talked about it, was putting pressure on her which in turn was turning her off, making her not want to have sex. 
To me

Never the less

She basically said that she doesn't go around ""just feeling horny"", her words ""I **could** be receptive to it any night, but you will never know unless you try"". 

Suggestions have been along the lines of: more cuddling on the couch, kissing, etc. to get her into the mood. 
(I was, the suggestion was for **MORE** of them.)

I thought after that conversation that we had come to an understanding(both of us agreed) that we needed to be more intimate than just once every couple of months.

Things haven't really changed. I don't talk about us having sex
I try to emphasize cuddling and massages a lot more often(when ever we get the chance)

We've had sex about once a month since then

An example, but she basically just curled up in bed afterwards and fell asleep, I felt cold and abandoned.

I feel like giving up, and I REALLY want our sex life to improve.
I often sit down and think about how people jokingly say ""you have sex less when you're married"". 
I always thought it was a joke

I'd welcome any advice

He says its because of his blood pressure medication. And fine, and has been thoroughly looked over by a cardiologist who says he's perfectly healthy and simply needs to find a way to relieve all his stress. The doctor suggested starting with therapy. This was completely unacceptable to my boyfriend, so the doctor prescribed him something.

He doesn't like to talk about it. Whenever I bring it up he just...shuts me down. So I don't get the chance to tell him I need something to change because I'm thinking hard about cheating. Or that masturbating makes me cry.

What he does know is that I spend hours every day talking to guys online that I've met on a bdsm site. And he doesn't care

I can't even get him to use a toy on me. And I don't want to leave him. And I don't want to be in a long term relationship where I'm not getting laid. I don't want to feel like my boyfriend is just my best friend. I don't know how to fix this. Working on myself doesn't even do anything.

I'm 32m, 2-3 times a week even after 4 years, but also we could be really open and honest with our feelings. I never felt bad about saying if I was horny, or discussing my fantasies even if I knew it wasn't her thing. Best of all she completely understood how men think about sex. 

We decided to have a kid. During the pregnancy we would still have sex when logistics would allow. However after our child was born she completely lost interest. Initially I was expecting this, then a year. After a year we had The Talk. She said it was 'normal' to lose your sex drive after becoming a mum, and she hates her body now, yes it's slightly different after the kid, but not that much in my opinion - which doesn't count of course, and she's very uncomfortable being naked. She felt that sex was something she used to do when she was younger but she's too old now. She's a little disgusted with her 'former' self, and no longer understands how men think. Worst of all we lost the openness as any talk of sex makes her feel prudish.

We tried all the usual things: I tried giving the child to the grandparents so we could escape to a romantic hotel for the weekend, basically she only wants sex to have another child and I'm adamant that we're not having another child until our sex life is functional. Finally I asked if she felt under pressure from me and would she rather I backed off a bit? She said she would like that.

So I backed off completely

The downside of course is that our relationship is in tatters and I'm not sure what to do about it. The problem is ultimately I can't make her fancy me and I don't want to be celibate. Philandering is all very well but I only get sex once a week or so

I've been lurking here long enough to know what the standard advice is. I'm not going to claim any moral highground for my actions - I'm not proud and no doubt deserve anything I get.

**A bit of background:** I am a married woman in my mid thirties. My husband and I met at high school and married straight after we finished. We have been married for 16 years. We've had more than our share of problems, and we've been trying to solve the problems since. We're in counselling, which is sometimes great, mostly awful. The marriage counselling has not focused much on our sexual issues.

I could easily go for six months without sex. My husband not so much. Until recently, once we've started. He is very attractive, sexy and he really knows how to satisfy me in bed. I orgasm easily, and usually multiple times. But I have never prioritised it.

Over the past year and a half

* **Frequency** - he wanted us to have sex more often.
* **Blowjobs** - he told me that the way I am about his cum makes him feel like I think he is disgusting; that he loves getting bjs and it makes him feel unattractive that I don't do it.
* **Porn** - he wanted to watch porn together. He went on and on about it
* **Initiating** - he told me that he didn't want to be the one who always initiated. It made him feel like I didn't enjoy sex with him if I never initiated.
* **Places** - I only ever want to have sex in bed. He wanted more adventure and spontaneity. He wanted to have sex in other places in our apartment

Initially, I was like ""we have all of these problems in our life, and you only want to solve this one? there's nothing wrong with our sex."" I felt like the talk was something bad he was doing to me. I was offended also, because there was a big mismatch between the way I think of myself, sexually speaking, and the way he saw me. I thought that he was making me out to be a prude with lots of hangups, and I didn't think I was.

It took a few of these talks and emails for me to really understand what he was saying

The thing that was easiest one was initiating. This was something that I could easily admit (in my own mind) was true, and I understood his hurt when he described it. It made sense, and there was an easy solution: I needed to initiate more. So I started initiating more. I could still improve in this regard (he still initiates around 60% of the time, but that is down from 100%).

The next problem I tackled was blowjobs. I used to give them sometimes when we first starting seeing each other, and he stopped asking for it. I thought it was just something we didn't do because it wasn't that fun (I thought it was like how we tried anal some time in the first year, and we didn't do it again because it wasn't very fun - we probably did it wrong). So, once the problem was raised, I spent a bit of time reading stuff on r/sex, and found that there were women there who got really excited about giving bjs, and were proud of the pleasure they were able to give partners. I envied that and decided to try to find the joy of giving blowjobs. It's about 6 months later

The porn thing has not gone so well. I don't enjoy watching porn with my husband. I feel weird because I do check out porn by myself sometimes, but I just didn't like it. The women are very different from me, and they make me feel inadequate. Anyway, we have tried it a few times, and he is pretty unhappy with my reactions. I have tried to explain, but I myself don't really know why I don't like it, so it's hard to explain. I have given him mixed messages

I also haven't made much progress with the places issue. A couple of times we've had sex in the lounge room, and way easier to clean up the mess afterwards!

The frequency is something I only made a half hearted attempt at, that women get lots of messages from society like ""if there is something sexual that you don't want to do, then you don't have to. no one can force you to do anything."" So I never felt any pressure to do anything I didn't feel like. If I wasn't in the mood, then we didn't have sex. I discovered this subreddit about a week ago, and read enough to realise that my attitude was a huge mistake. No, he can't have sex with me against my will - but it should totally be my will to have sex with him! He's my husband! So we have been having more sex in the last week. The awesome (and totally unexpected) side affect of this is that he seems more willing to do things that will improve the problems I have with our relationship!

I guess one of the things about my story, it could just take time. It took me quite a while to understand things from our talks enough to do anything to solve the problems. It took me quite a while to not think about what had been raised in them without anger. When I think about some of the changes in my attitude over the past year, I really wonder at how dim I was, not to understand some really basic stuff about sex in relationships.

sex was gone. she was incapable of becoming aroused around me. she never got wet and even with lube sex was painful for her. i tried everything. literally every trick in the book. she would come home and i'd have flowers on the table, the dishes done, give her a massage, and at the end of the night she still wasnt in the mood.

It seems as if fate is keeping us from having sex.  Although there is one update I think I need to share it might to help others.

First of all, and she's going to counseling now.   

But the biggest surprise.   She went to the doctor to see if anything was wrong with her and she got diagnosed with LYME DISEASE.    She's probably had it for at least 2 years.   One of the symptoms is potential loss of libido

I'm being supportive of her, I don't think we'd be doing well without this, but with this problem, it absolutely makes it worse.    Just thought i'd warn others there are always unexpected reasons your partner may be uninterested in sex.

1370407295.0,1fpb0e,So I exploded the other night,throwy123456,37,10,117,"Well things have been a bit rough lately.  Sex has been up and down and my gf keeps saying it is because she is changing pills again.   I have been drinking more and more on the weekends and well the other night I just flipped.

Now my gf always like to tell me how much she does around the house and how she is always picking up after me.  I honestly don't believe this to be true because I am the one who does the majority of chores around the house. Vacuuming, dishes are things I do 95% of the time.  I am more likely to leave stuff out though but I wouldn't say this is a big deal and I don't really see her pick anything up since I usually pick that stuff up when I do my weekly big clean. 

 She told me the reason I wound up doing everything was because I always did it before she woke up (which is true but she sleeps all bloody day on the weekends) So I did nothing for a month. She did no chores in that month. (I did remind her several times during this month) However she always said after a tough week at work the last thing she feels like doing is chores.

Oh I also cook 95% of the time.  I think she has cooked for me twice in the last 6 months and if say one night I am not cooking she just doesn't eat or gets takeout.  

So the incident happened last Saturday.  I snapped and did all the chores which were neglected for a month so I spent awhile doing them. I also decided to sort some rooms out so basically I spent all day doing chores.  While I was not doing that I also put on a nice roast and figured hey this might as well have a nice meal and put us both in a good mood.

So by this stage I have had a few drinks and a little bit drunk when she emerged from bed just when dinner was ready. The first thing she said to me was to have a go at the fact my dirty clothes are on the floor in the corner of the bedroom which I quickly pointed out that there were no clothes baskets since she had all 5 of them with her clean clothes in them waiting to be put away.She then said I left a spoon in the sink.  I was pissed I spent the entire day cleaning the house and made it fairly spotless

I let it go

Then came the straw which broke the camels back

I just saw red.  I threw my glass at the wall and shouted ""Like it fucking matters"" Told her to get the fuck out of my life

She then had this look of dread come over her face.  It was as if she suddenly realized why I went to all that effort and paying for lawyers and getting things signed.  It was to cover my ass for this very instance. She had signed away any rights to my property or assets. I told her this at the time I wouldn't buy anything with her unless I had this clause and I guess she must have figured that it wouldn't eventuate.

  I just kept telling her to get the fuck out.   I went to bed and she followed me. I kept telling her to fuck off but she wouldn't.  She snuggled up to me and I told her to go away.  We wound up having some of the most passionate sex we have had for a very long time. I am giving her some more time.   So far she has been more attentive towards the housework and is pitching in. I have agreed to cut back on the drinking. She did clean up the mess the glass made which I suppose is a plus.

However it is still early days

I'm a 24 year old female and I'm currently in a relationship with a 29 year old man. I have been with him for about 3 years. This is the first man I ever had sex with. I had other boyfriends before him, I even started learning how to do oral sex, which he really enjoyed. I didn't like it much at first, but I quickly grew to enjoy pleasing with my mouth as well as my body. And we didn't stop there. As we became more adventurous I let him finish in my mouth after oral, I let him go down on me (which he didn't seem to enjoy :() and once I even let him try anal. 

There is nothing I won't do to pleasure him. He used to always be the one who initiated the sex, anyway. As I became more confident, I began initiating sex as well. I don't have a super HL, but these days I am definitely the HL partner out of the two of us. 

I think it was in October of last year when this problem first arose. A week came and went without any sexy times. After about 2 weeks without sex, thinking he would come around. But when more than three weeks passed with no action, I began to get more vocal. One day I brought it up to him and we ended up in an argument. 

I feel like I'm rambling

Since that first argument, do his laundry and clean up after him. He's my child, not my partner.

When we have The Talk

As I'm writing this, I was really looking forward to being able to do that with him one day. Seems it won't happen, now. :(

One Friday night, wiggled my sexy bum (he says he really likes my ass) in front of him, let it rub up against his junk. I turned around to see if it was working. He stared back at me with a blank expression, flaccid as ever (in the past, he would have had a raging boner). We finished our shower and went on with the night. He played the crap out of WoW and I went to bed early, sad.

The next morning, I quietly went to the bedroom to try and calm myself down. 

He comes in a moment later and is all like ""what's wrong?"" I tell him, frustrated, etc."" He turns around and disappears into the bathroom, so I go back to feeling sorry for myself. A moment later he reappears in the doorway, completely naked. Confused, I ask him what he's doing and he replies, ""making you happy.""

I wonder to myself if he really thinks I'm going to throw myself at him after he rejected me and hurt my feelings. I start to cry. Loudly. My heart is fucking breaking. ""I was all ready to go last night and this morning

I don't mean, at least 4 years. I do get a pity handjob about once a month. 

I have become incredibly frustrated. I love my wife but her libido has been completely destroyed by birth control (which she hasn't been on in years), and anti-depressants. It also doesn't help that it physically hurts her to have sex (her hips), and unless she is turned on it hurts her vagina. So pity sex is out of the question, obviously.

I have had the talk with her already. About 2 years ago, the usual story. That lasted about 4 days.

Now don't get me wrong. I love my wife. I want to be intimate with her, I have tried praying to the old gods. Nothing has worked. I am frustrated beyond belief. I have never and don't want to cheat, but to be honest at this point I think I would if given the opportunity. I don't know if it would be ""cheating"" anymore, the ""game"" is over.

The usual responses are ""I'm tired"", ""I have a headache"". There is just no desire to be found. Even when I do get ""something"", it is obviously she is bored and it makes it really hard for me to finish.

As I said I still love her, I don't know what she would do if I left. This has make it really difficult to make the decision to leave. But, I have come to the conclusion that I can't be happy if I don't have intimacy in my life.

Still time to ask for help with recent developments on DB. I'll outline the history of the situation first:

* Me

* She enjoys it when I go down on her and has orgasms. Other than that

* only very occasional sex the first 1 year

(In the last thread, conclusion: the therapist believes my girlfriend is not attracted to me but could be attracted to other men.)

*Now here's the current story:*

Starting with September I started NoFap and we didn't see each other for a few days (visiting our parents). Around 10 days ago we met again and my increased sex drive caused *a Talk*.
My plan to stop fapping made her feel uncomfortable and she complained that if I continued
All of this initiated *the Talk* and I made some really good points about how I am not blaming her, she was baffled when she realized I could be happy with sexual but non-penetrative activity. Then we talked about how she could try getting off the NuvaRing (hormonal BC) to see if it would awaken her libido and that if it would work, she could get an IUD instead. She got pissed and insulted me (""you can't just pause using the NuvaRing for a month, it would mess with the hormones!"" / ""WTF do you think, I need to be on BC to avoid pregnancy"" / ""you didn't pay attention in school! you can only implant IUDs in 40-year-old moms!"").

So there was all but love in the air and when we had our good-night cuddle session an hour later

* *Maybe the therapist is right and it's not my fault but yours in that I am just not attracted to you. Maybe it would work with someone else and I would want to have sex. Maybe I just have to try that.*

* *There's nothing we can do unless I am in a sexual mood

* *I don't think I will ever be in the mood again with you*

* *With this problem persisting

She also said that if it weren't for the sex

In conclusion, but the +6lbs muscle make me feel a lot different)

Two days ago she gave me a handjob and therefore my NoFap streak of more than 30 days is lost. When I came

The dog gets more kisses than I. When I do, it lasted 4 seconds.

When we cuddle, is too much work for her (she's tired), the only spontaneous thing she does is kneading my ears because she likes that (I don't) and it reminds her of doggy ears.

I also begin to believe she might have feelings for me similar to those a daughter would have for her father. I offer emotional stability, ... But then again, she didn't have a sex drive in her first relationship either.


Now I realize this sounds very frustrated and like an unstructured rant (which it is) and most will recommend to leave. But to be really honest, don't worry, it's something really legitimate).

**TL;DR / recap of relevant information: girlfriend has no drive and has never felt sexual desire for anyone. She's not open to getting off BC and does not want to try sexual activity unless she is in the mood

**So how do I deal with this situation?** I would like to continue NoFap. But I can't even stand her running around the house naked after taking a shower. I can't cuddle without my mind telling me to kiss her passionately. All of this makes me incredibly desperate. Should I just ask her for regular handjobs? They are a lot worse than fapping myself but at least I can touch her breasts when receiving them.
Or could it even be an option to ask her for chore sex and make it so pleasing for her that she agrees to have regular sexytimes

one thing i've heard a lot from LL partners is that they want to feel closeness and intimacy BEFORE they can feel motivated to have sex. they want to feel appreciated and loved

but this is what they NEED to know: there is a level of intimacy and closeness that can only be achieved from having sex. i know this because i'm living it right now.

even though (apart from the no sex) my husband and i had a great relationship - you know, we always have fun together, etc"" it wasn't until we started having sex again that things got even better. and that's because the act of sex - the actual intimacy required and sharing of a loving experience cannot be duplicated in any other format. and when you are that open and vulnerable and loving with your spouse, it improves the relationship. you are once again a couple (that's why sex is a coupling). you are no longer just two best friends in a household.

My wife and I got married in 1999. Our sex life wasn't mind blowing, which hasn't helped our sex life, but we dealt with it. We were pretty much getting busy 2 times a week.

We held off on having kids until we'd be married for 9 years (yes...I've made that connection too...and well I guess it was actually more like 8 years: we lost one baby)

My wife was sexually and emotionally abused as a child so she's never been super into sex, I was more than happy to take it easy. I love my wife. I love her so, so much; it's beyond words.

But...

In January we moved to a new state, MAJOR fight in March. I mean we've never fought like that before. We pretty much made a scene in a restaurant, on a night that was supposed to be a date-night as my parents were in town and offered to watch our daughter while we went out. 

There was screaming

And the distance continued to grow. I had no idea why. We made up. Apologized, but there was zero sexual attraction. 

This killed me. I mean killed me. I am devoted to my wife. She's the most gorgeous person in the world to me: inside and out. I also strongly attracted to her. That was July 4th. We had sex that weekend

DB for over 12 years.  Married with kids.  Tried counselling.  Learned that our sex life **was** in the top 2% (she climaxed EVERY FUCKING TIME).  Learned that our sex life **now** is in the bottom 2% (only have sex once every 2 months or so).  Actually
      
My wife refuses to have sex in bed now.  She will only have sex in the shower.  I can't please her in the shower.  I can barely please myself in the shower.  She is much shorter than me, the more bitter I get.  She just doesn't get it!
    
The last time in the shower, we're not designed to have shower sex.  If she wants it to work, she could lose weight on her ass, bend over more, arch her back, or try a different location than the shower that **doesn't** accentuate the difference in our heights.  
     
Her super nice way of pointing out that all our problems would be resolved if I had a bigger cock is the absolute icing on the cake.  I'm average size.  Not big, I've given her orgasms galore.  She has just lost her appetite for anything that actually works.
      
So I am only guessing, where each person should have a little bit more interest in their partner's pleasure than their own.
     
Sex on her terms is deluded, our relationship, and her own pleasure.
     
If she absolutely doesn't have any desire to put in effort in this regard
    
Why should I obsess myself with this one delusional
       
I can stay with her and stay with the kids and keep other relationships on the down low.  But damnit, aberrant views in this regard?

When we had sex at her frequency, she was usually angry or sexually frustrated. She couldn't have an orgasm consistently, and the fact that she wasn't very turned on would bring out her ""everything must be perfect to fuck"" side, where in order to try to have an orgasm, she'd have to be perfectly aligned on the bed, foreplay would have to go exactly right, etc. In short, and she was frustrated because she didn't want to be there in the first place.

We've both talked and talked about this, wears slutty underwear, and on special occasions takes it up the ass. But she wants to have the kind of sex she likes (pornstar or not pornstar, it involves her being turned on and having an orgasm) if she's going to engage in any sex act. So the usual ""give the guy a handjob"" advice isn't part of our sex life. She's tried it a couple of times but she clearly wasn't much into it, plus, frankly, I'd rather just beat off than have a half-hearted handie.

Her depression is under pretty good control, forget it. So every year or two there is a month or six weeks where she's completely sexually unavailable, which added to my overall frustration with the situation.

Outside of the bedroom we're very compatible, and we enjoy each other's company. This is still true, more or less, even after what I'll call ""the smothering"".

So, we're a pretty good match, and since the sex was pretty good on occasion, my previous pattern with her has been to be the supplicant. If only I could cajole, beg, compromise, talk, everything would be good. 

During vacations we'd usually have more sex, and that made me have a ""what the fuck am I doing"" moment. Why was I going through constant rejection for a couple of sex acts per month? Was sex really that important that I should occupy so much of my time trying to get it from her? Did I want to feel so goddam powerless? Could I just cut it out of the equation and still enjoy the good parts of our relationship?

So what I did, instead of fantasizing about the porn star sex we'd sometimes have, I started watching more porn and willing myself to fantasize about the women in porn vids. I beat off more often to drain my sexual interest. I also stopped sleeping in her bed and completely cut off any mention or discussion of sex. I smothered my desire for her, for lack of a better term.

(I should mention that she snores, so we wouldn't have a blow up over it. Again, she is not obese - she has mild sleep apnea not related to weight, she's seen the sleep specialist, she's not ready to wear a CPAP every night.)

At the start of the smothering, but I'd just say I wasn't interested. She also went through a depression (unrelated to the sex smothering, I know for a fact), so there was the usual six weeks that she didn't want to have sex.  The long and short of it is that we had no sex for months, probably the longest period in our whole relationship.

I was pretty proud of my restraint - the only time I gave in was during a spring break vacation in February where I fucked her once because I wasn't getting my usual jack-off time. She came in about 1 minute and talked like a porn star when I fucked her. But when I proposed another fuck a day or two later

After we got back, I didn't. Then, yesterday, she wanted it again, and cajoled me into fucking her when the kids were out. I did it but I didn't come and had a hard time keeping it up, and she was frustrated with the whole thing when it was over.

A little under a year ago, someone who always came when we fucked, but I was in a state of fairly constant sexual frustration. Today, with her, I'm a limp-dicked, sexually indifferent, compulsive masturbator with retarded ejaculation

Are things better? I'm not sure. Now I'm going to decide where I want to go from here. I've been improving my masturbatory technique by edging and watching the kind of porn I like to the point where I'm more satisfied than I was. Maybe that's short term

BTW, workable sex life, not that one of us is right and the other is wrong. And, no, neither of us wants to fuck someone else.

It's been great.

On Monday, at this point what do I have to lose? I gave up my dignity and threw the anxiety of possible rejection to the wind: I texted him saying I wanted his cock and for him to come home. I did my makeup all nice, put on a cute skirt (forgoing panties) and waited for him, knowing there wasn't much chance it would do anything. When when he got home, I was flashing him and teasing him all evening... because at that point, I honestly, really felt like I might as well: I was used to rejection. But ... it worked. He was really into it, no ""throwing you a bone"" kind of attitude: it was really intense and dirty and great.

And it happened again, and talking about doin' it all day today, too.

My guard's not all the way down; I know this is a continuous effort, and I'm going to enjoy it for now. I feel... tentatively hopeful.

I can't do this anymore. It's been nearly 2 years of this one-sided relationship. I've yelled, bargained, begged, and cried. Oh, how I've cried. But now, I'm just angry. How dare you. How dare you ruin the best thing I've ever felt and made it into the worst thing I've ever felt. Cheating would have been better, at least then I wouldn't feel rejected. I know you want to want me. I wanted that too. But now I realize that the coldness I feel between us when we lay in bed is growing colder and colder. I feel it. I feel the ice. You pull closer when I pull away. I want the distance because to trust you again would mean being hurt again. 

But I can't keep feeling sorry for myself, new clothes, new body. But the same old me. None of this can change me, and I realize that now. The outside can't change the inside. I walk around with a thinly veiled attempt at confidence. *Confidence*. Being *sexy*. What is this? I can't recall the last time I felt this strange feeling of empowerment. We have sex, I feel bad, the cycle repeats. I can't accept any of your efforts anymore. I don't even remember what true acceptance is. I'm always trying to be different, to be new

I know this will hurt you, but what's done is done. I write this post and get it all out for once and for all. No more tears, sadness, hope, rejection, disappointment. I deserve a great love and so do you. I don't want to be away from you. I want to stay with you because I crave your approval. I want you to pick me up, spin me around

I can't say I'll always love you, I won't. I believe in love, respect, happiness, the whole thing. I will leave you and leave this whole thing behind knowing I've done my best. But I can't keep waiting for you. I know I'll be waiting an eternity.

I came away from that  accepting that I was making a choice between being a family man who is unsatisfied or being single and starting again (but not being the father I want to be). I chose family and I have been happy with that. I have been trying with some minor results to be the best man that I can be to improve the DB.

So last night came as a bit of surprise. We climbed in to our cold bed at the same time and my wife is wearing knickers, it's intimacy. 

I thought back to earlier in the evening when she was repelled as I kissed her neck. As though it sent sparks of sex or intimacy that were plainly unwelcome.

She sensed my sudden change in mood and in as an unromantic way as possible offered me duty/sympathy sex. I declined

We talked the same old talk, self/body image &amp; general tiredness. Or it could be me.

She likes her job

I love her body, it helps you to feel good and have more energy. Really, body image is just a state of mind.

Tiredness is the default setting for working parents

Me? I'm 6'5'', play soccer, have a respectable career, don't go out with the boys very often, do my bit in the home and don't drink much either. I could be a little more assertive. We've lived in her country Finland for 2 years now and I don't and will never speak much Finnish, so I am a little dependant. That's the one area I can work on.

What I really believe is the problem is that she thinks it's me who is in the wrong with my HL and not wanting sex or intimacy is perfectly normal for mothers and it would be weird to try and change that.

I don't know if you could really call our situation a dead bedroom


I read an article today that describes my situation perfectly and I wish I could find it now. It basically describes a guy who married his wife because on paper she looked great...educated, loves all the same things that I do. This is my wife and I. We look like a perfect match, but I feel almost no connection with her.


The one point we have never been on the same page as sex. When we were dating sex was still very vanilla


Over the past couple of years the sex has gotten progressively worse. When we were dating she would occasionally let me touch her breasts and we would make out some. That's all gone now. I get the occasional gift of kissing a nipple as a reward for doing something she wants around the house. Sex is almost always had with a bra and shirt on. It has to be in one position and if I'm not doing the exact right thing


We've had talks and arguments about this on many occasions. To her credit she tries every now and again, but I'm convinced her actions won't allow me to. She refuses to let me go down on her (an act I enjoy immensely) or to even touch her down there. We've tried vibrators and they still don't work. She has no problem getting herself of when I'm not around. She can't even get herself off when I'm in the room, laying on the bed next to her, so she's obviously got some issues. She's been to therapy before and I think that's the only reason she can have sex at all. 


Prior to being with her I was always able to satisfy my partner and had pretty good self esteem about my sexual prowess. With her I feel so undesirable


Earlier this year I started browsing the usual sites...AshleyMadison


Prior to meeting this woman I was seriously considering leaving my wife and we almost split up several months ago. Now..I'm certain I can't live my life like this much longer. On one hand I feel like a jerk for wanting to split up a marriage because I'm not getting good sex. On the other


The only real decision left for me is when and how to break it off. Her ex just left one day and she only ever interacted with his lawyer after that. She's said that she was happy this is how he did it and I'm considering the same method. I'm also trying to determine if I should wait for a bit until she's done with a school program she's in right now. Who knows...I might just wait until we have another big fight and bring it up then. I don't plan on telling her I was unfaithful


Sorry if that was a bit all over the place...it's kind of tough to put all of the history and my feelings into a logical



UPDATE: Well I started going through the process of leaving this morning. I put an attorney on retainer and jut signed a lease at a new apartment. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't terrified

UPDATE 2: Just got done telling her that I'm leaving. It was fucking tough! Hardest thing I've ever done. She cried, and finally accepted. I got my dog, computer, and a few other important things out. I just hope she doesn't try to fight me too hard on equitable division. I feel like a weight has been lifted, but at the same time sad, and most of all… scared. I know things will be ok, it's just going to take time.

Unlike me, over years, with ""its not a good time"" and I'm busy.""

Fast forward to my dead bedroom problem, and how it no longer works as a sex placebo.  I was asked to put this off since it wasn't a good time.  

Something within me died and broke.  

Sitting at my computer

Realizing what had happened, turned it off, and told her what occurred.  She wore the look of shock.  

She went to bed, she was going to have to deal with those emotions that I could no longer contain.  

I'm at a point where I'm simply not going to live my live this way.  We do not have kids and I can walk from this with the minimum of damage since we basically have little to no shared marital assets.  I will be on the hook for about $15k of her loans

I'm at the end of my rope and she knows that.  She knows that I need a release and i would like an aggressive set of actions on her part, and this is only getting worse.

I offended a lot of people with my last post, I came here looking for specific advice on how to turn things around.

As an update since my last post:

* I've been feeling better about myself every day.  Nothing really changes, my mind believed all the crap I wrote in my last post but it took a few months for my body to start believing it too.

* Because I'm more relaxed and carefree again, but I've already said everything that needs saying multiple times.  She knows sex is important to me at this point, and reiterating it every few days doesn't help anything.

* When I am rejected for sex or other intimacy, but I've got other shit to do if you aren't interested, don't worry about it, we'll do it some other time"".  I can ask for it all the time, but there isn't any pressure any more.  Feeling pressured was probably the single biggest turn-off for her.

* I read a bunch more PUA / Game / Alpha stuff across the internet

* Based on the Alpha Game mentality, successful woman, but at home she prefers to be told what to do.  When I first read about this in all the Alpha blogs, I thought it couldn't possibly apply to my wife, but they were right.  Every time I make a decision, regardless how unimportant it is, I catch her smiling at it.

* I don't shy away from sex talk any more.  We used to have a bunch of ""code words"" to avoid saying anything raunchy.  Now, I never would have thought she would like this but she smiles and playfully laughs.

* We get along again.  We're loving and cuddly

--

Regarding sex itself:

* A while ago, she clearly didn't like it, it was dry and painful (for both of us), and pretty much terrible.  After talking we agreed to have no more terrible sex.  I'd rather not have any sex than have dry, quick, painful sex, that she wasn't getting anything out of

* Last week, she let me cum inside her which I hadn't done in YEARS.  It wasn't the best sex for either of us, but we've gotten the ball rolling again, she actually wanted it, and it didn't hurt her.


Now, and obviously everything isn't all better.  But I feel like we have gotten over the most serious barrier to us getting back to normal (or, getting to normal for the first time).  She was ovulating at the time (I started tracking her cycle), so this is probably a once-a-month move from her, but I still feel progress is being made, and I'm no longer tracking the number of months since the last time I've had sex.",,,,

Especially the fact that I'm a woman

I think because most women view men as ""Always horny, because there is the constant stereotype that only men get rejected. 

I've been with my guy for about a year and a half. We've been living together for almost a year. We click on every aspect

It's harder and harder to accept those reasons for not having sex, and just seeing them as excuses so he doesn't have to be physical with me. He's very affectionate with me otherwise, but only to a certain extinct. He never kisses me for more than a few seconds, doesn't like tongue at *all*

Ah, on the other hand, can't stand it. He tells me it's boring, that he'd rather get right to sex. I've talked to him about it before, explained to him that I need it to feel intimate and to enjoy sex more. He simply either replies ""Foreplay is snoreplay"" in a joking manner, or he just squeezes my tits a little and kisses me a little more for a few minutes then goes right into it. 

He does have depression, it seems that he's a selfish lover. We live together, I should be waking him up with bjs, sneaking into the shower when he's there and letting him fuck me like a sex goddess, staying in all day during the weekends and simply enjoy each others bodies. 

I offer blow jobs, but doesn't like me to lick or tease any other part of his body. Therefore, he doesn't do it to me. 

He doesn't go down on me either. Actually, I reply that he doesn't have to use his tongue a lot. He can use his fingers and it would still feel better than nothing. Still....nothing.  

I miss being touched like someone has passion for me. I miss someone ravishing me, just so I can be happier and push the fact that I don't have any intimacy in my life out of my mind.

I forgot what sex feels like with a condom.  I have no idea where you cum if you're just bootycalling.  Do you go down on a booty call?  What if I only last 2 minutes? Do you spend the night or still be casual and be like ""call ya later"".  What if she gets attached?  What if I get attached?  

None of this will matter once I've had a couple of drinks and a good conversation and feel relaxed.  These are all my worries because I simply feel like a 28 year old virgin.

It's been 4 years for me with absolutely no sex. I'm the HL/25, he has no interest. I think our physical fitness is a factor, but shouldn't be that huge of an issue. My bmi is 27(overweight) while he is a little past obese(he won't tell me his exact weight, funny). We used to be thinner but things change. I'm a much more active person, but as far as actually working out, my motivation is lacking.

The catch is that we have a child together, which puts a strain on our relationship; I have no family. He's a total momma's boy, and she and I don't get along at all, so you can see how that goes.

He's the laziest guy in the world. Blames me for nearly everything. He expects me to work, clean the house, etc; he'll clean sometimes, maybe 30m once a week. Meanwhile, he has no job and is trying very little to get one. He watches our little one but that doesn't take up an entire day - I know, I've been in those shoes. I'm okay with being the breadwinner if he would just put more effort into us and actually fuck me once in a while(is every other night asking too much?).

Is he depressed? I don't know. He doesn't have many friends. I don't either

I don't really *want* him anymore. I'm not a great lover, of course, feel ugly, unwanted, dirty, low, worthless

Today and yesterday my GF and I have been entertaining my sudeen horniness - which came upon me without any warning at all while I was working yesterday morning and lasted until she came home from work. I was blue balled pretty much all day today too. Oral and hands suddenly feel like nothing I've ever experienced before - it's like a whole new world of sensation has opened up for me and I'm able to orgasm during foreplay and twice or three times again during sex - this has happened before but it came so naturally this time and wasn't any effort - I just wanted more and more!! Maybe this is because I was so pent up but it happened both times. I didn't fight them and they were within a minute

I'd had a really shit day at work today and for the first time EVER

She's even *looking* different

I could go on

For all of you who you or your SO's have lost interest because of PMO - seriously get them to try this. I can't begin to describe how much more powerful the sensations are and how close I feel to my GF right now. I feel so manly and vigourous during and after. I can't fully describe it.

I feel like there's never a good time to have a(nother) ""the talk"".  He's both in school full time and working full time.  I help him with his school work almost nightly and try to be as accommodating as possible to his schedule.  I feel like bringing up how crappy I feel ends up sending him into feeling like crap about himself and he struggles to get anything done/focus after the conversation.  

**So yesterday

Fastforward to the conversation.  I told him that I didn't even know what to talk about and that I just felt awful.  I told him that even though we've only been married 10 months

**We have some friends where the wife in the relationship is extremely demanding.**  They live well above their means.  They set a budget for a house they could afford, and gets screaming (literally, we've been witness to it) mad if he doesn't do what she asks.  They're also in a DB situation, but where he's the HL and she's the LL.  

**I'm not like that.**  I cook dinner every night

I ask for things like loading a pile of blankets into the back of the truck and laying out looking at the stars.  I ask for taking the dog to the park and playing catch with a football.  I ask for touching

It's not fair to see someone else be degrading and mean and unkind to their spouse and get everything they want while I'm the one who is uplifting and sweet and genuine and I can't even get a kiss that's more than a peck on the lips.

He broke down, like taking a walk on the beach for five minutes or watching an episode of How It's Made with me and talking about the cool stuff we see.  He was upset with himself and feels awful about it all.  He promised to make efforts to do something different.  I talked about how hurt I feel and how I just don't know how to trust when he says that things will change.  **He was upset and feels like he's been incredibly selfish and said he wants to stop being that way.**  We'll end up bringing some of this up in counseling next week.

I talked about how sex has been unfulfilling and he agreed that it hasn't been good for him either the last time or two we've done it (once this year

The talk just kind of dwindled out and we went to dinner.  **We came home and ended up having awesome sex that he initiated** and I orgasmed twice

**He left me a note this morning apologizing** again and saying that he wanted today to be the start of a serious turn in our relationship and how much he loves me.

**I want to believe it will be different

I want to be accepting if he really is making efforts and changing the way things have been, I'm opening myself up to the just as likely possibility of more of the same.  But I feel the the possible ""reward"" is worth that?

**I'm going to try to think of this as a Day 1 in efforts to make a change and see how it goes from here.**  Sigh.

When we first got together the sex was often and amazing

Things were going well and 6 months into the relationship he got orders to deploy. While he was deployed he gained weight. So much so he was put on notice by his overseas commander. He says he was so busy with work that he didn't have the time to work out. His deployment comes to an end

He soon starts drinking a lot. He's having several beers a night, and he just needs time to relax. The drinking continues. Along comes a mock PT test and he fails. He's then put on notice by command, and is made to start doing monitored workouts. Meanwhile he's not cutting out the beer, and cutting back on food portion size. Every time I try to mention the beer he gets defensive and says he feels like everyone is picking on him. I drop it. His actual PT test comes around and HE FUCKING SLEEPS IN, and is late for the test. He's now on the commanders shit list.

He also procrastinates on everything. I have to constantly remind him to do things to the point I feel like a nag. Then when he does do something he half asses it, making dinner, and running errands. 

He is however a really sweet man. He compliments me and tells me I'm loved. He's book smart, and has been there to support me when I needed it most. My friends and family love him.

--

I have been with my fiance for nearly 8 years now. We're finally getting married this September. I am very happy about this

My fiance, but, I have the sex drive of a mute, peeling wallpaper. I rarely ever want to have sex. It's not that sex doesn't interest me, it just doesn't interest me as much as him. I can't say that I feel it is personally important in a relationship, and that's conflicting since I know that is *is* rather important in typical relationships. But, I can't force myself into it

So, you see, there is the problem. Yes, I do find him sexy/attractive. Yes, I want to marry him. Yes, I want a family with him. But, I'm worried that my lack of sexual vigor will drive him away, make him unhappy. I don't want Joe to ever be unhappy.

We've tried talking about it and the only consistent variable of this discussion seems to be my lack of interest. More commonly so I find myself saying, or cuddled, or penetrated in any orifice. I don't want candle lit dinners and romantic music with rose petals and bubble baths. I've done those things and they don't make me want to have sex--they just make me sleepy. And it's hard for me to spontaneously get into the mood to begin with, but since arguments over my lacking desires and reading online that sex on a weekly basis is normal and healthy, I feel pressured and it makes it even harder because now he doesn't just want it, Joe fucking *expects* it. And why shouldn't he? He works hard and loves and takes care of me. The least I could do is give in every now and then, right? And I do, it's never on my terms and that's such an unfair thing to say since 'my terms' would safely be once a year if I could get it my way.

I feel so inadequate. I feel ugly and stupid that I don't experience sexual urges regularly. And I really *want* to. I feel it's a real possibility that this problem will come up again and again in the future and may destroy our relationship. And I know he's unhappy about it as it is. I've tried every sensual thing I could think of and find and I just can't bring myself to want it when he does. I feel that I'm being very selfish and unfair to Joe. So, I wish it was as easy as ""just effing do it, you cunt"", but it's not.

Thank you in advance for your time and patience with this problem. It means most.

**TL;DR: My fiance has a usual sex drive and I just don't. I want to give him what he wants but I can't force myself to be in the mood when I'm just not. Advice?**

EDIT: Oh, have lived together for over 2 years, I am a woman, and I am very content not having sex. Though I am not oblivious to sexual appeal, I can not say that I look at other men/women and think ""yeah, I'd let him/her do me"" in any regular way. The way I feel sexually towards my partner, I pretty much feel towards anyone, what little I do feel is often just for my fiance. Does that make sense?

1329666359.0,pwhl8,Wife lacks common sense when it comes to sex - continuing DB situation,Ro-bearBerbil,27,1,50,"I've posted on the subreddit before.    This is a specific rant I need to have, I feel like the more sexually experience one at this point.  Primarily

So, it goes horribly wrong.    She's somewhat willing to go through the motions, but it is beyond obvious she'd rather be having a root canal than be there.    She thinks I'm some kind of mind-reader that can tell this and she apologizes for not ""acting better"" even though what I've stressed is I don't want her to fake wanting to have sex with me.   So, we both agreed she would let me know the rare times she's in the mood.

Here's what happened last week.   I feel asleep first and she came to bed a few hours later.   To my surprise, start kissing her, and initiating right back.   Things are going well, and all of a sudden, she's no longer into it.   I was going down on her at the time.   This happens a lot.   I ask her if anything is wrong, and she tells me everything is fine and to keep going.   She ""doesn't mind"" me going down on her (I love it) for a few minutes so I keep it brief and move on.

But it is well beyond obvious she doesn't want to keep going.   She's stressed to me that she would tell me if it isn't working for her so I keep going.  We eventually more on to intercourse but I know this isn't doing anything for her.   Which kills it for me.  I don't lose my erection or anything

So

Of course we had a long drawn out conversation about this, she got equally as mad.  Both options would have ended with her crying.

So, taking the focus away from her sexual pleasure tends to turn her on.  I've suggested she shift the focus to me - like give me a blowjob instead if she's getting to that point.   If I was losing my erection, I would shift the focus back to her until I was turned on again.  And if I had found that it wasn't coming back, I would just make sure she was taken care of and not worry about myself.   If she were to do the same for me, there's a chance she could get turned back on and eventually move to intercourse.  If not, I could have an orgasm and we could call it a night.   She agreed this make sense and could do that in the future when feeling this way.   For me, this seems like common sense.   For her, she just forgot.   

That's basically the first common sense issue.

She was having some body image issues we had talked about in the longer conversation, got her magic wand out and helped her very quickly have an orgasm.  She was happy and feel asleep quickly.  It was about 2:30am and I had to work in the morning, but I knew she was upset and this would help her along.

Of course, but I am willing to help her whenever she wants it.   And forgoing an orgasm every once in a while is fine, but this is typical behavior for her.   It's just the right thing to do to at least reciprocate to your partner.    This to me is also common sense.

She knows our marriage is on the line.   We have a 2 year old which is basically what's holding us together now.  And she wants another child

Over the course of a week of short, but that a sex life of all quickies seems so. . . transactional.  There's no real intimacy, there's no real depth to it.  Her response was that it didn't matter as the end is all the same.  Get in, get off and move on- who cares how it's done?  'Foreplay is too much work and too much time.' is one of the things she said.  

So I tried explaining to her that my idea of a healthy sex life is much more robust- it's exploratory

Anyway, even though she orgasms, and she just doesn't care about it.  I find that devastating.  I just don't know how I feel about a lifetime of knowing that the person I'm having sex with is only doing it out of obligation and doesn't care about what's happening between us. I'm really having a hard time digesting it, and I'm hoping that someone here has been on either side of that scenario and can tell me how it works and how it still feels rich, and caring and worthwhile for you.

He gets so defensive that it feels like I'm molesting him so I've stopped trying to touch him lately.

I'll try to kiss him passionately in the shower and suggest that we go to the bed, but he pushes me away and immediately after the bath he will suddenly be *so busy* and there's suddenly just *so much work to be done*.  It's hurtful when someone pretends to be busy to avoid you.

I decided to post here because this problem is consuming my thoughts. I've cried too many times over this.  It's starting to hit me hard that we've had a DB for almost 4 years now.  In the past 2 years we had sex just 8 times.  We haven't had sex since December '12.  That's almost 8 months without sex or any kind of sexual contact.

I've always thought that sex is just something couples do.  That is happens naturally.  I've talked to him about this a few times but I'm always left with more questions than answers.  He's given me two big hints: that he want ""intellectual stimulation"" and ""mental seduction"".  I asked him what he meant by this but he wouldn't answer.  He did say that sex is not about physical seduction for him.

So what can I do to intellectually stimulate him?  Sometimes I wonder if this is the actual issue or if it's another excuse.  I feel hopeless because if I haven't figured it out after 4 years

Well

She didn't take it so well...

She immediately started screaming at me, and sick. She said that's where my high libido comes from. Deeper into the argument, I asked her what she expected. Was she just expecting me to keep suffering in silence alone and not try to occupy myself? I mentioned counselling, but she thinks the religious counselor she saw that told her sex isn't a significant part of a relationship was good enough for her; that I'm the one that should be seeing someone. She then told me that she's talked to all of her married friends said they hate having sex with their husbands and that I should be happy with our once a month arrangement. She was acting as if I had nothing to complain about and that I'm being unreasonable by expecting her to be interested in me sexually. She said that I am lucky she's not withholding sex just to get favors like other women do. She said every woman thinks sex is disgusting except for whores and sluts. She said she has to force herself to have sex with me and also asked me how would I feel if she told me that every time we have sex she fantasizes about dicks much bigger than mine. I told her I bet she already does and she just smirked. It was at that point that I left the house to have a smoke and let things deescalate, I hate arguing in front of our daughter.

Now I'm sitting in my office watching E3 videos

I just want someone to feel the same way towards me as I do them. I want to be wanted, I want something to look forward to....

So on we went... for 8 years... me never completely satisfied with our very vanilla sex life. I am kinky, but it's always obvious that he doesn't really enjoy it at all, regardless of how much it turns me on.

I could maybe live with vanilla if it was good vanilla. But he doesn't try anything to get me wet. He doesn't try anything to get me off. He doesn't know how. I made the mistake early on of letting those things go

The problem is, because I told myself that lame sex was better than getting 1/3 of the way through it and stopping. And the psychological ED thing just felt like a crisis that I needed to fix, rather than stopping and thinking, *hmm, maybe we're not compatible.*

So I thought, and he did something that felt really good, like, twice, and then never did it again. I have no idea why - I definitely let him know it was good and encouraged him to keep at it. Just no motivation.

I've tried over and over again to talk to him about his approach, worthy), how much more important sex is to me than it is to him... and I have never been able to get through to him. No matter how much I explain that this is hurting me, that this is important to my *life* and my personal sense of well-being, he just isn't motivated to make changes.

Over time, making it even harder for him to approach me. 

He is so shy about sex that he can barely say the word. Like, like it's a dirty word. I find this shyness repulsive. 

To make matters worse, shrinking, beta approach.

Last year, sadistic, amazingly skilled man. I felt like myself for the first time in so many years. I don't feel guilty at all.

That experience served to further highlight the massive chasm between myself and my spouse, really *not.*

After that I realized I couldn't stand to be around him anymore for fear that he would try to have sex with me. I told him we had to stop for a while. Otherwise I'd be running away from him all the time.

So there it is... DB, it's something that is going to need to be addressed.

I asked for an open marriage at the end of 2012, though, because I definitely cannot go back to the way it was before. 

Edit to add a little salient background info:  
* I am currently sans employment
* He is a traveling consultant; the kind that is gone for 50% of every week. This obviously complicates our problems with disconnection.

Five years ago he left an email account open. It was an initial contact to an escort. I lost my shit and dragged him out of bed.

Another issue is that although he has always thought me out of his league looks-wise (and comments from friends and strangers confirmed this: ""how did you get her?!). I don't get that. But although he loves me

Since we are and were still physically affectionate (we sleep snuggled up, kiss), the therapist had us do massage on each other, building up to doing it naked. That didn't work, really. For me, desire happens BEFORE the clothes come off. You want to rip the clothes off because there is desire!

Sex has been steadily dwindling for a year. Now she doesn't want sex more than once a week. For the past 6 months we've averaged maybe once every 2 weeks. This just seems crazy for people as young as we are. We've talked about this, then the sex would come naturally. This is bullshit, the reason I have retracted almost daily massages, cooking awesome meals for her and being an all around kick ass boyfriend is not only that my needs are no longer being met, but I just bought a house and I'm remodeling it the way SHE wants it. I asked her beforehand if she was game to this plan and she agreed and was excited about it. You think a person would appreciate that and maybe have some energy to be a little intimate once in a while? No, she comes home and watches TV while I work my ass off in and out of the work place. 

Now I know that I sound like an asshole writing this, (not like I haven't been there) but it's like she can't even see how the DB is ending our relationship. She thinks we're getting married and she talks to me about the children we'll have! I once thought we were on course for this but I no longer think so. She knows this yet she makes no changes because now she feels like I'm forcing her with my expectations. Funny how when I talk about what I need and want, suddenly providing it is now ""forced"". It's a vicious cycle. I don't say anything, I get nothing. I say something, I get a reason for getting nothing.

By the way, I've taken to browsing gonewild and fantasizing about how great it would be to have a real sex life.

It's been a week since we had that conversation and I have been doing my best to be attentive to her needs and be emotionally connected with her.  A few days ago she told me that I was being really clingy.  This confused me because in prior conversations she told me that one of the reasons for her lack of sexual desire was because I wasn't spending enough time with her.

I would just like to have a conversation with everyone here.  I'm not necessarily looking for advice, trying not to make her feel pressured.

My boyfriend (29) and me (31) have been together for more than 5 years. We love each other very much - without any doubt. But our sex life is non-existant - and mostly I'm the problem. There are several reasons for it. 
I used to have a HL
 
1) Here's the 1st reason: I developed a skin problem (heavy acne - noone knows why) some years ago and my gynecologist therefore perscribed me a birth control pill. Problem is: Since I've been taking it
When I don't take the pills

2) My boyfriend is a VERY handsome man (part time model) - but when he tries to seduce me

3) I used to be very unhappy with my body. I was never fat or anything - but I just didn't like it. Now I went from 71 kilos to 61 kilos (1, but that didn't have an impact on my libido a few years ago, so I don't know how this issue fits in...)

4) I used to like ""fancy"" stuff in bed - I like toys, I like role play - but my boyfriend (who was in for it in the beginning), doesn't seem to like it anymore.

Fortunately: We are talking about this issue quite openly and he knows that I'm willing to do something about my problem (even though I don't know what at the moment). And he also promises to think about his ""part"" in this. 

But still: I feel like an asshole for being that non-sexual woman every man complains about - especially because I really used to enjoy having sex - A LOT.

He made love to me a lot at first... now 4 times a month this month we've only made love once. I try to ignore it because he likes to hug, cuddle, grab my breast and ass. He pinches and kisses my breast a lot... that should be enough right? It makes me feel like shit that it isn't. I want to make love. I want us to have that close moment of being together like that more.

It sucks... We're so great together and happy yet... he hardly ever wants sex and I always feel like something is wrong with me. I have not gained weight and have gotten so better with emotions/mental things. WE never fight. I have actually lost a lot of weight because I am training to be a fitness coach.

He wanted to have sex yesterday but he stayed up to long and said we could tomorrow. It is tomorrow and he is not feeling it... he tired to cuddle me but still did not want too. I wonder ""You even try?"" 

Worse is he started watching porn again. It is not near as much but I always fear it will go back to that. I caught him twice watching it and touching himself makes me feel awful. Why can't he want me like that?

I told him if I looked like a porn girl then maybe he'd want sex and he said

I just want him... and I just wish he wanted me like I want him. I could have sex everyday or just give him a blow job everyday. I don't care. As long as we were close.

I feel bad because he is very friendly in other ways and it should be enough. But

I'm so happy with him and we get along so great. And he says I am very sexy and pretty and loves when I am naked. And he'd rather me be naked all day long then have clothes on so he can admire my body and touch me and kiss me. And I love that but in the back of my head I beg him to do more than touching I beg and long for him to grab me and make love to me... and then it makes me feel like shit that his touching isn't good enough.

He has no problems in the sack or getting it up or anything. He just doesn't put any effort in trying to want it.

I am not looking for help just wanting to express myself. I know he can do more for our sex life. Stop playing video games all the time, he has no will to do anything right now. And I am putting my foot down soon but not about sex... but other things.

He is wonderful and so kind to me and we love each other so much.

Why can't I just toss out that sadness from lack of sex? Why does it hurt so? Why can't I just ignore it? I ask myself a lot.

Every night if he lays with me or is at work I touch myself fantasizing it is him and that he wants to have sex. I masturbate when he is at work and I am sleeping and fantasizing it is him. I tell him this and he likes the thought of me touching myself too him but he never jumps me like I long for in my head.

How can we have such a wonderful relationship and yet I still feel like somethings missing because he wont have sex with me more?

I just want to force myself to accept that kissing

as I said not looking for advice just wanted to vent.

Somewhere along the way in the last 5-6 years my Libidio has dropped off... Significantly. I wen't a good 3-4 years without sex and it didn't really bother me (both me and my wife during our 3 years before marriage decided on waiting till marriage). Well now we are married and the gloves are off so to speak and it's become very clear who has the higher libido of the 2 (and she's got a high one).

Not worried about cheating or anything like that. We've both made it pretty clear how we feel about that and that is a marriage ender for us. However

As much as I don't feel in the mood. I'm going to be naked and ready for my wife when she walks in the door (which for her should be a pleasant surprise (I hope lol)). I enjoy sex with my wife

So I guess this post is kind of 2 fold. Wanted to say thank you guys for this subreddit and how it has opened my eyes to the possibility of a relationship slowly rotting away from the inside because of this. The second thing is more of a question:

How do you inspire your body to be more sexually hungry? I am stuck in between wether the problem is with my body, I'd rather be working on my video game, or doing something constructive on the internet. I almost feel annoyed that shes ready to go and I am not. I know she does it a lot out of trying to be a good wife, and wanting to please me (she has the best of intentions) but I just cant figure out why I am having such a hard time feeling sexually attracted to my wife. I mean during sex, I don't think about that. Once were having it, i'm in the mood good to go. It's just that getting up to it. Is it possible it's Low T? Or do you guys think this might stem more from a degradation of our relationship in some area? (That is a very real possibility too).

Step 2a: Tell her you just want to feel loved and you only feel love through sex (even though she tells you she loves you more than anything...clearly she doesn't
 
Step 2b: Speaking of fake contentment, because it's BRILLIANT to be quiet about the very thing she admittedly has a hard time bringing to mind!  Makes all the sense in the world! It's as genius as giving the silent treatment to a deaf person, see how smart you'll be? Also, be sure to keep track of exactly when you have sex so you can assault her with the info when the time is right. You sly devil you! With all that fake contentment she'll never see it coming!

 
Step 3a: When she tells you she knows you have physical frustrations and that she'd rather you bring it to her attention so that she can make a point of resolving it instead of you silently resorting to porn, she should be thinking about this all the time. How dare she ask you to ASK for it. She's so lazy!

 
Step 3b: When she asks you to ask for it...by all means DO NOT do it! She is trying to come up with anything that can help fix her failing....do not help her!!!!!! BE OFFENDED BY IT! That will show her!
 
Step 4: Run back to reddit instead of talking to your wife. Pretend she didn't tell you that she would never withhold sex from you, not out of wanting to make you happy. She has to get it right!  All those bitches and their quest to make you men miserable! How dare they! Men shouldn't HAVE TO ask!

Step 5a: When she does initiate, licks you, squeezes you with any intimate muscle she can, places your hands on her ass and tells you how she likes that, climaxes every. single. time. and acknowledges that it's been too long and how much she loves being intimate with you once her mind can transition there. **Reminder!! Ignore all of that in your quest to never make things better!
 
Step 5b: Be sure to tell her that when she does initiate, how selfish...she should have just continued selfishly depriving the man she loves so you could go on being upset with her.
 
***Hang in there! Just a few more steps. You're doing great and you're in the right place! This forum has an impressive rate of men that have succeeded in continuing to fail! A very wise investment of your time...keep reading!
 
Step 6: When you're really ready to emotionally castrate her, having to get a new residence, and not getting to see the kids as much. You are on roll now! Just remember that this is the mother of your children and the woman who gave herself only to you, and these steps may have heartbreaking collateral damage. Maybe even guilt. But if you feel shitty...blame that on her too...she forced you to this place after all. Selfish woman....by your posts on reddit it should be clear to her that she is much more to you than just a broken wife.

Hello

(26/m) here. I have been together with my SO(25/f) for 6 years now. I realy love her and dont want to leave her but our sex life is near-death for quite some time now.

She is always very passive and unresponsive during sex

I carress her, but she is pretty unresponsive to it most of the time. We usually fuck until my stamina runs out and she does moan a bit at the end(and I'm very glad for that), but she rarely comes(and then usually with clit stimulation) and her orgasms arent realy discernebale. She never wants me to eat her out or use the toys we bought for her, and she never does anything on her own. I dont know if I just have unrealistic expectations(because she was my first) but to me its very unsatisfying the way it is. Often I dont even want to have sex because from her passiveness and unresponsiveness gives me both the feeling that she doesnt realy want it or finds it pleasurabe, and that I dont realy get anything back from her.

We talked about that and she says she enjoys the sex we have and I asked her multiple times to at least sometimes tell me when she orgasms

I'm hoping a bit for tips how to improve our sex life. At the moment I have to motivate myself to have sex with her everytime because it just became a chore with little pleasure to me.

I am a childhood victim of sexual

Anyway, just treated it with casual sex and applied it liberally.

Then I met my wife. She came from the exact opposite of an upbringing. She was nurtured

We ended up getting married and our sex life was pretty good. A healthy 3-5 times a week. I finally relented and started seeing a therapist. While my sex drive didn't dry up

The economy being what it was in 2009, theirs was 2 floors above us). 

She said things would be better when we were on our own. Lo and behold, that's where we would go together. 

At first, but 2 months later, we were having even less sex than before. Then she claimed that things would get better on that front when she got a job. She got that job 3 months after we moved. It's now been over a year and I can count on one hand the number of times we've had sex since we moved.

I am sick and tired of my hands being pushed away, but I still use it so as to at least keep my nuts from going on a full scale revolution and in constant discomfort.

I love my wife, and that depresses and scares me most of all. I've tried talking to her about it and she says to not give up on her, but part of me kind of has on the sex front. I know she's not cheating because she really doesn't have the time in her schedule. I know though, that I've been having wet dreams for the first time in like 15 years and she isn't the star of them, and that makes me feel ashamed.

I just don't know what to do anymore. Before I met my wife, but I go home and the best  thing I can look forward to is dinner and Netflix new releases. When we were struggling, I was selling stuff sometimes just to pay our few bills, but I was happy with her and I know she was with me.

I just don't know what else to do. I've remarked to my wife that she's the sweetest person I've ever met who would never hurt anyone--except me. To that she admits its because she knows deep down, and had no follow through. Similarly, even if I threatened it, I'd be just as full of shit, and other than being accused of being like my dad, being like my mom is the worst thing I can ever imagine being.

This has been going on ever since.  Fast forward to Saturday Sept 29th and I notice she is hanging around me and she blocks my path out the door.  We exchange some flirty words and she says 'want me to take care of you?'.  Before anyone reading this gets excited, I replied.

A little over five years ago
-When we moved in together
-Neither one of us had ever lived with our SO and it was a big step.  Maybe he wasn't quite ready and I'd pressured him into it.  Aside from that
-We were stressed about money and I was making more than him which made him feel less manly.
-I wasn't on BC and maybe he was worried about the possibility of adding a new person into this mess.
I made all of these excuses and more for him.  

From my viewpoint, reacted by becoming depressed and super sensitive about everything.  I started picking fights and eventually he got frustrated enough to tell me that my advances were making him feel like a piece of meat.  This was a slap in the face for me as I've always been a very physical person and he'd never seemed to have a problem with it before.  

It was a full three months after moving in before he consented to sex again.  I was so excited.  I thought we'd made it through the bad parts and things would get better.  I was wrong.  

He got a new job and was always tired and sore.  He hurt his leg at work, ""ham-handed.""  I got on BC and, while it didn't lower my libido, it did affect other aspects of sex which made me more self conscious and awkward. My self-esteem dropped so low I wasn't sure that it existed anymore.  EVERY fight came back around to the same thing: sex.  During all of this time, I was lucky to get sex three or four times a year.  He was still watching porn and masturbating regularly, but wasn't interested in sex with me.

He was staying up late playing video games and I had to be up early for work.  He met a married woman while gaming online and she sent him naked pictures of herself.  When I found them, it wasn't that bad since they had never met in person and it was ""innocent.""  This was probably the worst thing for me and at this point you, whoever you are, are probably wondering why I didn't leave him.

And the truth is, he was my best friend and the good times were AMAZING.  Whatever the reason, it took a good year or more before he truly regained my trust.  

More life changes occurred.  We both lost our jobs. We moved to a new city more than 1000 miles from our old one, good memories happened... Sex did not.  I spent a lot of time talking, not to him, but to others who tried to help me.

By the time we were engaged, so in love with him that I decided I could try to survive without sex.  It was so bad that, no, we did not have sex on our wedding night.  Yes, I cried and was forced to initiate two days later.  Still, every fight led back to sex and now it was worse because, in withholding sex

After one particularly brutal fight, I would work on not pressuring him.  There were compromises.  For instance, he wasn't allowed to watch porn until two weeks after we next had sex and he still owed the same amount of sex.

By this time

Then

Not everything is fixed but we have made great progress that I once thought impossible.  We talk and rarely fight.  We try new things.  We've reached the point that I feel comfortable offering to pleasure him without expecting something in return.  I no longer wonder ""When will the next time be?""  because I know it's coming.  I even turned him down for the first time ever.  Hold on.  It can get better.

A little background: [24F] and [28M], communication, verbal and/or physical cues alluding to love, a commitment.

We get along very well and usually have a lot of fun together, as long as I'm able to keep my dissatisfaction suppressed. We honestly are platonic friends that appear to be ""romantic partners"" to outsiders.

Last night was his last night home before going out of town until Sunday. He wouldn't snuggle with me, but laying there in bed, I was almost physically in pain from my desire for human contact, even just a hand to hold or a kiss on the shoulder. I felt so unloved and unsexy and unappreciated that I turned over and cried. And then something snapped in me. It was so disrespectful of him to not try to please me in the slightest. If he loved me, he would make some sort of effort to ensure my happiness. He knows exactly what I need and want and he makes no effort to step outside his own comfort zone for me. 

So, but my heart's been removed from the situation. I'm not really sure how to explain it in a way that doesn't insult him, because I'd like to remain friends and roommates (I'll move into the spare bedroom). Last summer, when we broke up, I gave him no room to NOT be my friend, but inviting him to a weekend away with friends immediately. It worked swimmingly, and our friendship was better than ever.

She went for her 6 week postpartum checkup yesterday and mentioned a few things about what her and the doctor talked about. It really made me feel numb. I became quite quiet, then laughed like it was a funny joke. The background is that she thinks she has lichen sclerosis, which I am absolutely adamant she doesn't have. We have 2 kids together now, and 1 each from previous relationships. Sex has been dismal to say the least since the first pregnancy. 

I think I am assertive, I end up getting nowhere...

&gt;I read your comment on Facebook that I'm a great husband and dad. It was a cute comment, but I just can't. What I hear from your lack of intimacy or sex with me, is that you really don't want me as a husband. You want me to be a celibate father and friend that helps you raise kids. You can't kiss your husband. Or touch me sexually. My sexual needs are dismissed and not acknowledged. You want a practicing monk to raise kids with.

&gt;I appreciate that you want to tell me what happened at your doctor appointment. Your comments trigger lots of emotions and confusion for me. Hearing comments like ""it's normal post-partum to not have sex for 6 to 9 months even without lichen"" makes me upset. It's like you are telling me in a round about way that I'm not going to have sex for years. You won't ask for a second opinion on lichen. You won't get one. And you put a steroid cream all over your sensitive parts. Why won't you get a real diagnosis? ""Doctors can look at severe lichen sclerosus and know what it is. But usually, and therefore not making you ready for intercourse and in turn causing pain.

&gt;Then the comment about practising abstinence for our birth control just hurts. I don't want abstinence. I want a sex partner that cares to please me, outdoor sex, making love sex, dirty sex. I want it all. With you.

&gt;Going a year or more without intercourse may be normal for some people(very few people), handjobs, making out, boob sex.Even if I could just nurse from your boobs and touch myself, it would be something. Going a year or more without ANY SEXUAL CONTACT is not normal. It is crippling. Except for people that practice abstinence. And those people aren't in a relationship. I am not a celibate priest.

&gt;You make comments about not having sex for such a huge length of time as if it is normal. You don't seem to care one bit about me and my wants and needs during this time. This coming month it will be 6 months since our 1 time having sex and before that in August camping where we didn't really have sex but I pestered you and was in you for a few seconds. I've gone 3 years since I've had oral sex. 3 long years.

&gt;When I suggest that maybe I should look elsewhere as it looks like we are not going to have a sexual relationship, and am so incredibly attracted to, if I can have sex with other people. I don't want that. But I also can't be in a sexless marriage. 

&gt;You say that you ask me to sit next to you and ask me to sit closer. But that's as far as it ever goes. You may ask me to rub your back or feet, I wouldn't feel so rejected and dismissed.

Anyway, etc). Although nothing too extremely out of the ordinary. I try to help in any way possible. Not to be crude but I just thought that maybe if I pleased her ""sexually"" and as selflessly as possible, maybe she would appreciate it and most importantly, physically and mentally feel a little better.

So I kiss her and touch her last night in bed. She seems receptive at first. And with all of our DB struggles, I'm going to actually try to make love to my girlfriend and not go over all my insecurities in my head. Basically I just wanted to turn her on and go down on her then let her go to sleep. That was it. 10-15 minutes tops for the particular purpose.

As she seems receptive to my advances, ""What are you doing?!"" I said something along the lines of ""What do you think I'm doing?"" I don't know wtf the deal is, but the way she said that, I felt like I got punched right in the stomach/heart. I rolled over and just silently cried for a few minutes in between feeling pissed off. I couldn't believe my partner of 4 years just asked me what I was doing when it was extremely obvious what I was doing. I don't know why I got so upset but I felt like a fucking kicked puppy (sad, huh?) and I've dealt with a lot of sex/intimacy issues in this relationship. She apologized and said she blurted it out on accident; she was half asleep, etc. (Although she was prepared to watch a TV show 'cept it hadn't downloaded yet!)

One thing I know is that I've always been confident as a lover; I've always been attentive, I haven't been with a million people but you know the difference between having sex at the age of 15 vs the age of 30, for example. But last night made me question all that, and then I started to think, what the fuck - maybe it's not me. Maybe she should be with a woman who she WANTS to be intimate with, and maybe I ought to be with a woman who is receptive to my sexual advances.

Anyway my sexual confidence is shot even more than it was before. It's hard to ""forget and move on"" from here

In hind sight, it was mostly just not knowing how to talk to each other effectively. After a few weeks of this, she went to her parent's house, called me and told me she was in the process of killing herself.

This destroyed me. I walked all night. I was terrified that I lost the woman I love. I kept blaming my employment situation... If only I had a job and was a real man

When she came to the next day, she would get angry insisting that I was not the reason, but the recent fighting didn't help.

For the next 2 years, so never again. The work situation has changed immensely. We are doing better today than we ever have. She is pursuing her graduate work, as well as being very active in her field. Unfortunately this has left her little time for us. When we are together she is always to tired for anything. Given the chance to be out with friends, her energy is abundant. 

We haven't been physical in over 4 months. The occasional kiss, I finally said something. Her reaction? “I have never forgiven you for when I tried to kill myself.”

I wept. Almost 3 years have passed and I thought we had moved on. It blindsided me.  All I have been thinking about is how much I love her and how much energy I have put into this marriage since that night and what little I get back. I have considered an affair because I feel like my sexual needs are being held hostage as a bargaining chip for when we disagree. Emotionally

My apologies if this comes off in a disorganized mess and the length. I have just never said anything to anybody and.... well

But what to do?  I have mentioned divorce to her, but I love her and I want to believe her.

1344795817.0,y3ona,I'm not sure I could be more confused...,3mmbleed,23,3,58,"I've been reading DeadBedrooms with interest over the last couple of weeks and almost all of it is ringing very, and it's an underlying psychological issue for either one or both partners

Firstly, and on the whole it has been amazing. I am as attracted to her as I was when we first met, and our relationship has grown into a more mature couple type dynamic without losing any of the fun. I am 30 and she is nearly 27, so I am always conscious of not taking away her youth by pushing is into a settled, boring lifestyle. We go out a lot for food, to gigs, the cinema - in many ways we are still dating. We've talked about marriage and both see it in our future but not for a long time

So things are pretty good, but both have had previous partners and have a reasonable idea what we are doing. But after the first 18 months, our sex has gone down to once ever month or two. It was a fairly steady decline, ebbing to every Sunday morning (which I never find the most sexy time) to the point where it is nearly non-existent. I will go weeks of frustration, only for 3 minutes of sex to reassure me that things are okay and start my optimism that we are back on track, and then we go another 6 weeks without any action.

There are naturally some complications - my girlfriend lost her mum in her very early teens, and also suffers from IBS. She gained weight as a teenager, managed to lose it now, but has to work to keep her weight in check, which she does to great success. (To be clear, she is hot. I saw her in a bikini for the fist time last week and my erection has only just gone down). 

In comparison, am naturally shy and a little bit awkward, and if I'm being honest, not that good in bed. I have maybe had ten partners, and have never had any complaints, but I don't think I've ever made it in to any women's fantasy list. In the last couple of years, I seem to be suffering slightly from premature ejaculation, but in full penetrative sex (nice term) I last a couple of minutes at best. I also emotionally cheated on her about 3 years ago

Quite personal writing all this on the internet. Anyway, she doesn't bring it up. I've reached breaking point a couple of times when I've had to ask her if she is still attracted to me and why she doesn't want to have sex with me. She assures me that she is and she just doesn't want to have sex with anyone.

So my real problem is this. I know all of my faults. I know what I'm good at, I'm not wallowing in self pity here. I'm becoming an increasingly confident guys as I get older, I take care of myself, I have good social skills, and I think if we ever did split up I would be okay. I'm not the greatest guy in the world by any stretch, but would like to think I tick a lot of the good boyfriend boxes (sex performance aside). I have a good job, take care of most of the bills, athleticish build

I'm sure a lot of people here read through the posts and think the same as me - I already do most of these things. Okay, but why is it my job to fix everything, all on my own? And why does fixing everything involve me cooking, cleaning, back-rubbing, weigh lifting, shopping, snuggling without the expectations of having sex

Like many other people have said, and makes me start to resent her. She must know how I feel, surely?

If I had worked out that I had a drinking problem and it was making her miserable, then why doesn't she want to do anything about it.

A lot of the low libido posts on her have said that they simply do not see sex as an in anyway appealing prospect. And I can understand that. But there are many things in life that are sometimes a chore, if you didn't do any of latter 3, you would be a jerk. In my opinion, it's simply not acceptable to say you don't like it so you're not going to do it. It's the easy way out. 

I see it as like running. I didn't use to run, I went and had a 3 mile run with her. It hurt, and I was bad at it, and if I'm honest, I didn't really enjoy it. Plus, I felt a bit self conscious as I had to wear shorts and everyone could see me. But she wanted to go again, so we did, and it wasn't so uncomfortable. Pretty soon we were doing 12 mile training sessions

After my girlfriend had run her marathon, I was glad of the rest. But then her body started to crave the running again, so she wanted to start up again. I wasn't keen, but I always support her, so I decided I'd go with her. I didn't enjoy it very much, but we worked at it together... and you get the idea where I'm going with this analogy.

Plus I always run in lingerie

Sex is as key to the body as exercise. Plus in theory (even the way I do it) it's a lot more fun. Anybody in a loving relationship who can honestly claim that they are in touch with their partner's thoughts and emotions

To pre-empt any of the usual advice, and I know that we need to talk more. And I'm quite clearly having a moan, and now I've got it out of my system will hopefully be able to get on with sorting it out

When he and I first started communicating he talked big about a lot of things that I was specifically interested in. After travelling to visit him a couple of times there just wasn't much going on but we couldn't get enough of the companionship element. I ended up moving across the country to be with him despite how little sex was going on. He seemed pretty depressed and I was patient.

Fast forward a couple of years and we average once a month. Maybe. Very brief interludes when they occur. Sex has become a serious point of contention. He swears he'll fix it but things stay the same.

I'm visiting back home and have a laundry list of things to take care of here so we've been apart maybe 3 weeks or so. I had been hounding him to at the very least flirt with me because I was feeling very lonely and wanted to feel his interest in me (That sounds far dirtier than I intended.). He swore that he would take some time to talk to me and I asked if he could help me pick out a toy or something to keep me from completely raging out at him about all my pent up frustration. Last night he obliged and we had a discussion that went far more in depth than I expected. I'm fucking exuberant over this shit. Trying to reign back the excitement

I started by saying that I wanted to talk about the whole lack of interest in sex while in a relationship thing ... and I wasn't met by the usual groans and contention!!! I asked if he had sex more frequently while single, but he said he didn't know why and he wanted to fix things. I told him that it was likely because he found sex with new partners exciting and monogamy just didn't do that for him and he confirmed this was the case. There is nothing wrong with that. We talked about how sex and emotions often don't correlate with our logical ideals. I told him that I didn't understand why he would let something he found gratifying slip away in favor of abstinence. He, of course, said that he cared about me and wouldn't want to do anything that might jeopardize our relationship. I get that, but satisfying his sexual needs and having a happy relationship don't have to be mutually exclusive. He voiced concerns over me being with other men and I told him that wasn't what I wanted. What I wanted was for him to have a sex drive and that the lack thereof was just as toxic to our relationship as potential mishaps. 

Basically, rational discussion about the matter. Anyway, looks like we have a way to possibly make this work. At the rate we have been going I won't be able to deal with no sex for the amount of time we'd like to spend together.

In the past 8 months I’ve experienced a huge decrease in libido.  I don’t feel like having sex except maybe once every week/2weeks.  I don’t feel like having sex with my SO/anyone/myself for that matter.  It’s not that my SO is not attractive, or I see male models in magazine ads, I always compare them to my SO and just think that he is so much more handsome.  He also always tries to make me feel beautiful and communicates to me how very attracted he is to me, constantly complimenting me on my looks and body even when I’m in sweatpants with no makeup on.  I know he’s extremely attracted to me and I him but when it comes to initiating sex I just freeze up.  When we kiss in the back of my head I’m constantly wondering if it’s going to lead to sex, or when I come over if he’s expecting to have sex with me; that when some sort of contact happens and we start wandering with our hands, I tense up and a million thoughts race through my head.  Obviously this takes me out of the moment and my SO can feel me tensing up and the hesitation in my actions and this hurts his feelings immensely and it will often lead to an heated argument and him/me feeling like shit. 

We’ve discussed this many times, the importance of sex and everything.  I get that sex is essential to all relationships and this is messing with his head and self-esteem on a whole new level; for example he’s extremely insecure now.  He feels like he turns me off, I’m not attracted to him and that someone is going to steal me away.  Complicating matters is that I used to be borderline nympho in the first 6 months of the relationship.  We had an extremely passionate relationship emotionally and sexually, where we’d have sex 3 times a day almost every time we saw each other, and both initiate equally.  I am at a point where I realize that I am the problem, that I cannot keep hurting him but I don’t know what’s wrong with me.  We’ve tried discussing various solutions, maybe I need more space; I got more space, that didn’t work either.  I feel no desire to have sex

I feel like something psychological is messing with me and my desire but I can’t pinpoint what it is or how to fix it.  I have tried working myself up to it; fantasizing about him in the middle of the day (Like I used to) and telling myself how good sex feels etc. but when it comes to the actual act and he starts to touch my all over my body and our kisses get more passionate

**Edit 2:** TL;DR: Chronic stress

**Edit 2:** I included a lot of detail

Apologies in advance

About 4 years ago, though we'd been forced to live in it in that state due to the ongoing lawsuit and finances.

During this time, had no energy, was depressed, and got sick a lot. While I was not diagnosed, my symptoms would have pointed at adrenal fatigue. My doctor and I tried antidepressants, which didn't help. Instead I self medicated with too much video games and junk food. I'm about 6'1"", and weighed around 195 lbs

My wife also gained weight during this period

Throughout all of this, HJs, or even just kissing or sticking her tits in my face while I jerked off, etc. *Mmm, boobs.*)

Just a few months after starting her treatment, and finally getting that sorted out was all that we needed.

Over the new few months

Sometime during all this, but unfortunately my wife's was not there at all. We probably had sex about once every 3 weeks for the majority of the pregnancy, and maybe only once during the third trimester. She was much less GGG and would either act annoyed or pissed off if I tried to start any intimacy, or just push me away.

The repairs to our house were complete

Over the next few months, cleaning, shopping, and chores. I basically had a really bad roommate rather than a spouse. Some of this is understandable, what with a new baby and all, but the degree to which I was shut out was extreme.

We moved (again!) just a few months later. Things got a little worse in our relationship but didn't really change. I don't think we had sex for the next 9 months or so.

I had occasional on-call shifts for work that went from 11am to 2am the next day. Since the baby slept in our room (in our bed, and even though I'd been lifting weights since I'd initially gotten back in shape, I was getting weaker and my weight was back down to ~ 160 lbs. I would invariably catch a cold coming off every on-call shift, which would lay me up for 5-7 days.

My libido had tanked (again) and I was having trouble maintaining an erection. Attempting masturbation was just depressing. I was waking up 4-5 times a night to pee. My performance at work sucked, depressed, couldn't sleep and losing weight. ([Wikipedia on hypogonadism.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypogonadism#Symptoms)) I found a new doctor who diagnosed me with hypogonadism, or low testosterone. I started treatment and was feeling better in short order.

Sex life was still dead during this period. I think we may have been up to every 6-8 weeks, and just wanted me to get it over with. Hot. At least masturbation was enjoyable again, though my wife didn't want anything to do with me. I was emotionally dead.

I was gaining weight and getting stronger again. Amazing how anabolic steroids will do that. I was up to maybe 175 lbs

Shortly after our kid's first birthday we bought a new home and moved (again!). After moving in, then work, then go shopping, come home, cook dinner, clean, give the kid a bath and put her to bed, then either take her to Gymboree (or similar toddler activity) or play Facebook games all day while the baby played

At least I had the entire bed to myself.

After a few months, I was the only one who slept in the master bedroom at this point) the next morning, she was upset and started threatening divorce. (I'd say this is the low point of things.) We talked a little more, and I got her to agree to counselling first.

I set up appointments with a couples counselor and asked my wife to set up childcare during that time. She didn't

For the next two appointments

Somewhere around this time, we all saw that coming.) I don't remember what I said when she told me, but I it was along the lines of ""What do you want to do about it?"". I knew, of course, that having another kid would be a horrible idea (see: everything written above). While I never said that we should end the pregnancy, I was definitely focused on the downsides of having more children. At the same time, I admitted that we could afford it

Around this time

We had a counselling session the next day (or maybe day after) and actually had a babysitter. When we brought up the pregnancy the therapist was pretty floored. She also brought up that this might not be the best time to have another kid

The next day my wife told me that she was going to schedule an abortion and file for divorce. She cancelled the appointment with her endocrinologist. I managed to talk her off the ledge, and what it would take to pay off the house and fund education for two kids. (Actually, this is probably the low point.)

By the end of the week, but was sensitive enough to try not to show it. My wife blamed herself for having cancelled her endo appointment. I found out later that she was suicidal during this time. She did start seeing a therapist, one who specialized in post-partum depression and post-partum anxiety. The therapist recommended that my wife begin medication to treat her anxiety and after some contemplation, she did.

It's been a few months now

I’m continuing to see the couples counsellor on my own while my wife is seeing her therapist.

I changed my TRT method and finally got my own hormones sorted have put a little more weight on again

Sex is still not as frequent as I’d like, and I still have a lot of resentment toward my wife due to the rejection that I dealt with for so long.

A while back, and have 4 kids.  I have a HL, and my wife has a LL.  It didn't start out that way, but I digress.  We had gone to bed, and I was drifting off when I heard her vibrator kick on.  I am obviously aware of what is happening immediately.  I ask her (rhetorically) what she was doing.  She says she couldn't sleep and wanted to have an orgasm.  

I know under normal circumstances that isn't a big deal, since Christmas we have had sex, maybe 5 times.  I am a, bare minimum, once every three days person.  The spoken agreement was that if I needed it, I could just tell her.  Well shit hasn't been so good for a lot of different reasons.  I have gotten shut down again and again, so I was getting pretty hurt about it.

So she waited until she thought I would be asleep to do her business.  That got me.  What really got me was that she knew that I was desperate, and I finally have enough, and get out of bed and leave the room.  She keeps going and finishes.  She never speaks of it, I have been on the couch because I can't even speak or look at her most of the time.  She has had seemingly no problems with this.  She goes to bed, and I avoid her at all costs.  The agreement was her idea, and I conceded because it was the best I felt I was going to get.  

I wrote her a letter, am a retired disabled veteran of 32 years of age.  I was in the Army, and made a lot of money.  Well 7 combat deployments, IED's, firefights, death, never brought me down this much because it was all so surreal really.  Don't get me wrong I know I have some issues, I just can't stand to keep in contact with my old buddies

I can't reconcile this.  I can go anywhere and not have sex with someone.  I have no support from her, because out of the fear of them having to treat me for my injuries and I will have to submit new medical data.  Then we will only get my disability.  She doesn't work, she used to do nursing, then work in a financial planning place.  She ~~is~~ was doing online courses to get ... something.  I know that my family only tolerates her because of me and the kids, she is typically an internet knowitall bitch.  She knows this and even gets teased for it.  

Regardless, she isn't there, I know it can't happen.  But when she is there and it doesn't, well hell, what am I supposed to think.  She will undoubtedly see this, because she snoops on everything.  She is very insecure/nosy.  She actually told my mother that she follows my reddit posts.  Since I have nothing to hide, I never really cared.  I just can't take feeling like this anymore.  I fucking despise being lonely, and quickly.  We went pretty strong, they are there

So, then I breach the subject, but I can't.  I am going to the VA rep to set up counseling/therapy next week.  I have pretty much given up.  I don't want to talk to her, I just want to remain indignant, and not be around her.  Yes I have read what I wrote, and yes I see it too.  So spit your hard truths at me, if bombs and guns haven't killed me

&gt;In retaliation for making her have ""the talk"" over the years, the variability allowed in, and frequency of, our sex life. For instance, I'm pretty much not allowed to touch her in certain ways, at certain times, or expected to initiate. *I'm also given a very prescribed sequence of events required to ""turn her on"" if she does acquiesce to being touched.*

Ah yes

Instead up hitting Up Down Up Down A B Left Left A B on the controller, mostly from violating them:

1. Never after sundown. Heck
2. Never on a week day morning.
3. Rub her back
4. Don't try to touch a breast or butt or other erogenous zone unless and until she gives *the sign* that she is ready for me to proceed.
5. *the sign* will not be defined or discussed or acknowleged
6. Do not assume that
7. Do not let one's erection touch the butt unless and until the female crotch has been engaged and adequately attended to.
8. Do not expect her to actually touch the penis.
9. Do not attempt anything fancy - there shall be only two approved positions: missionary and her on top.
10. DO NOT - UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES - Change positions after insertion has been achieved. She is NOT some kind of whore.
11. Do not expect any help whatsoever with the act of insertion - see Rule 8.
12. Once insertion has been achieved, ""Stayin' Alive"" by the Bee Gees is the proper rhythm.  Do NOT sing it out loud.
13. And...you're done. Roll off quickly if you're on top. She will disengage quickly if she's on top and go directly to the bathroom to clean up. 
14. There's lots of tasks to be completed around the house, let's get busy.

Of course, that's a recipe for an unsatisfactory experience for all.

That unsatisfactory experience led to anxiety issues which were not helped by her unwillingness to touch the penis or help with its insertion

That's why there are no more attempts at ""the talk"" and why there has been no sex for about two years.  I actually thought I was horrible at sex,"" I told myself. I'm in my 50s.

Then, however, no rules.  There was anxiety, for sure. But she was patient and kind and made me feel sexy again and the anxiety was gone in the first 15 minutes.  I actually surprised myself (and her) with my stamina and my energy and my creativity.  

When I got back to my Dead Bedroom, but I'm no longer burdened by remembering which rules to follow and when.  Instead, I lie in bed and think about the last time I was with my lover, wonder when I'll be with her again, and drift off easily into sleep.

TL;DR - I used to have to follow a very prescribed sequence to turn her on

1348203196.0,108gfp,The perils of co-habitation,marriedscoundrel,29,8,7,"One type of pattern I’ve been seeing lately in posts is how the sex slows down after moving in together. You’d think the opposite, there are some of the issues that can contribute to a dead co-habited bedroom.

**Lack of effort** - Remember when you didn’t live together, wore something nice, put on a nice scent, etc. Are you doing the same now that you live together? Granted, you can’t really dress for a night out every day, but make sure you aren’t falling into a pattern of laziness when it comes to your presentability. Much of this may be more psychological than visual – perhaps TMI, but my wife stopped shaving her armpits and legs. Getting turned off by hairy pits is one thing, and would sometimes be self-conscious of it if she felt a few strands were coming in. 

Additionally, you have to accept that person on a psychological level first. In a long-term relationship or co-habitation situation, we sometimes take this for granted. 

**Losing the thrill** - When you lived apart, you see each other every day. Even if your schedules don’t line up, you know at least your partner is within reach. Effectively the spark is gone. Finding a way to re-create the feeling of anticipation and something to look forward to could be key in making sure you two don’t fall into a rut. Essentially, you have to figure out a way to date your partner, even though you both live together.

**Single-lifestyle habits** - Living together is more than just sharing a space – you have to change your lifestyle to take the other person into account. A lot of people, so it’s time to jump on the computer, or play your favorite video game, or read a book, or watch TV, etc. All things you do easily and regularly when single. But what about the other person in the house with you? You will want to have times where you both are free to do your own thing and enjoy your personal interests. But you both must take care to avoid letting those get in the way of interacting with your partner. I hate to admit this, but despite me being the HL partner

**Bringing baggage home** - The nice thing about home is that it’s our sanctuary. When the world is raining on your head, I’m HL, but on days where my wife was in a fowl mood even if she asked me for sex I wouldn’t really be interested. Someone who is frustrated, irritated, angry, etc, isn’t really someone who is sexy. Again, it was difficult to approach me when I came home looking exhausted and defeated by life. In some cases this caused a dead-bedroom circle - anticipating no sex I'd come home rather flat and apathetic - seeing me in that state

**No joy of the hunt** - One aspect of sex is accomplishment – that a member of the opposite sex finds you attractive and desirable. It’s very much like validation. And as such, sometimes making sex too available to your partner can turn them off. I notice this more often in men, who usually take on the “hunter” role in the sexual dynamic. But I think it can and does apply to women as well. Essentially the more available you make yourself to your partner, the less inclined they are to want you. Does this mean you have to start metering out your sex? Not necessarily. But it can help to find a way to make your partner feel like you desire them specifically, and not just that you’re horny and want to get off.

Again, and in my experiences these are some issues that contribute to the situation. Some or none may apply, or it may apply more to your partner than you. Hopefully this can help to identify some of the issues you face so you’ll know where to start in solving them.

* I was stressed beyond belief with a new business.  Rather than cut me some slack or offering to help (without lecturing or telling me what to do), 3am or later.  Every night.  It got to the point that I wouldn't even come to bed until I knew he was asleep - and then he started waking up when I snuck into bed, and starting the fight then!  I had to be at the store for 7:30am every morning, so as you can imagine, this made me extremely tired and short-tempered, and even less likely to have sex with him.  Or anyone, for that matter!

* I went on Nuvaring, and after the libido appeared to resume (I regained attraction to men, etc..) I had no desire to be with my ex - attitude counts!

* In December 2010 I fell off my horse.  This resulted in a broken hip - yay me!  I wasn't able to physically do much more than shuffle walk, a hip isn't a part that *might* get in the way - and actually said these words:  ""You could at least give me a blowjob.""  Like the break was something I did deliberately to get out of sex.  And that was the final nail in the coffin, as it were.  We didn't have sex again for the rest of the relationship (another year - because I'm unbelievably stupid).

* My ex was lazy.  He did nothing around the house

* While he was out partying (and likely cheating constantly - I'm not that stupid)

I used sex as a weapon against my ex, if your partner suddenly has less interest in sex, or life in general, don't pressure them for sex.  Don't harass them into the night and make them dread the thought of going to bed with you.  Do things around the house to make them feel appreciated, and to help them feel less stress.  Don't lecture or demand, don't act like a fool.  ANd definitely don't accuse them of cheating because ""you gotta be getting it SOMEWHERE"".

hugely different sex drives. [Xpost from /r/
relationships]",3,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/r7upx/boyfriend_seems_unwilling_to_compromise_on_our/,"Hey, reddit. Obvious throwaway is obvious.

I’m female and 23. He’s 34. We’ve been together for about 2 years and cohab for about six months. I’ve had about twenty sexual partners. He’d had about three or four including myself. His first sexual partner was at 28.

We recently moved to another city so that we could find work. Success! I was able to get my first job after a year or more of searching and he’s making twice what he used to. Our issue with sex didn’t really come up until we moved in together. Before then

When we first got to this city we were able to stay with his step-brother, X. We are both really appreciative that X and Y were willing to let us stay for the 6 weeks that we did. However, Y seemed a bit resentful that we, two complete strangers, were staying in her house without paying rent. We tried to be as helpful and cooperative as possible around the house. The boyfriend wasn’t willing to have sex while they were at home for fear of annoying her. So I tried initiating sex on the few times that we did have the house to ourselves. I was successful about half the time. The rest of the time he was too tired, or had been drinking, or watching football

I was excited when we started renting an apartment of our own. “Finally!” I thought, after I made the first moves. However, our sessions were always two-minute jackhammers without any foreplay on his part. I was more than enthusiastic with providing blowjobs, kissing, touching, and other fun stuff. It just wasn’t reciprocated. Since this was the only kind of sex we were having I began to feel used. It seemed to me as though he was just using me to get off.

I brought this up with him and he confessed that he was only having sex because I wanted to and that the sooner he finished, because I felt as though I had somehow manipulated him into have sex whenever I wanted to. Third, I really didn’t appreciate how dishonest it seemed. When I told him how I felt he apologized said that he only really wanted sex once a month or so. I said that I’d be happy with sex once or twice a week, and we agreed to compromise.

Weeks later, he admitted that he didn’t care if he didn’t have sex. He has said in one of our recent talks that, in his past reading of stories with ""frigid"" female characters, he has identified with them. I suggested that we start opening up our relationship. I said that I’d like to sleep with other people since I missed the physical aspects and I wasn’t getting it. He responded by saying that there would be jealousy issues since I’d be having sex with people that weren’t him. He also said that if I wanted that, he wanted to seek out other women “so that we could both get what we wanted”. What. But he said that he didn’t care about sex, and I wasn’t getting it from him anyway! What was there to be jealous about?

Another example of his excuses about lack of sex include turning me down on the last day (also the lightest) of my period because he didn’t want to make a mess. This happened after I told him a few days earlier that I put a towel under the fitted sheet of the bed so there would be no stains. Another time

We later discussed the possibility of going to see a counselor

I have long lost the willingness to initiate sex because I’m so tired and sad from being turned down most, I’d probably have a better chance of getting laid by a complete stranger than the person I love most in this world. Ugh.

It feels a little better just to vent about it. Moving to another city has eliminated most of the people that I can openly talk about this to.

I am a 56 year old LL woman married to a 52 year old HL man. We are about to celebrate our 28th wedding anniversary next week. Sex was good during the 2 years we dated and the 1st year of our marriage. Then I stared trying to get pregnant and infertility reared his ugly head. Sex became a chore and just created more stress. We struggled for years through medical treatments but the end result was that I could not conceive. This was very devastating to me. The fact that I cannot have children will stay with me forever. My husband was OK with it.  We then moved on but the sex that followed was never frequent enough for my husband and not always that satisfying. We had our share of arguments but he often would shut down and would not express his feelings. It got so bad that we agreed to try marriage counseling quite a # of years ago. The psychologist was not very good but it got my husband talking about his feelings and we were able to have really good discussions at a local restaurant each week after the sessions. We did talk about plenty of issues with the doctor but not about our sex life. I think it was just too uncomfortable to talk about. Things seemed to get better but then we settled into the same routine. Early menopause then started which brought on more issues such as mood swings and vaginal dryness and  low libido.
 
My husband is not happy about the quantity and quality of our sex life and intimacy, he does the opposite. He takes out his frustration on me by treating me badly. He is moody and downright mean towards me. His sarcastic tone can be chilling. He won’t communicate his feelings. He won’t initiate sex even though he wants it. His behavior hurts my feelings badly.  I can’t take it anymore!
 
I am STARVED for affection and intimacy. The things that I crave, putting his arm around me, complimenting me on how I look or for something that I have done. Just doing little things that spouses do for each other to show that they care.Do something nice for  me that is unexpected such as making a romantic dinner or buying a bouquet of flowers for no reason. Communicate with me. Ask me how I am doing. Suggest fun things to do together. Make me feel sexy. Make me feel loved and cared for through his actions or words.  Go to bed at the same time as me instead of staying up to watch tv! Tell me that he loves me.  (does he?) These are all simple things and don’t take much effort.  
 
By alienating me
 
I have discussed my low libido with my gyn doc many times. He prescribed a testosterone cream a few years ago that I was willing to try but it did not seem to make a difference. I have been using an estrogen cream to help the vaginal dryness. I have bought lubrication to use. I carefully pick out my outfits to look sexy when we go places when it just the 2 of us. When we recently vacationed in Mexico
 
I am the one that initiates sex.
 
I love my husband and would do whatever it takes to improve our marriage and make us both happy.  It will take both of  us to do that.
 
I need him to talk to me. It was a start that he told me to look at the blog as others expressed the same feeling he was feeling. He would not tell me his feelings directly. It made me do a lot of thinking and I thought that writing out my feelings that he could read would start us in the right direction.

I've heard all the excuses, not me. I honestly thought some if it could honestly just be life getting in the way. His father passed away unexpectedly a few months after it started, and shortly before he returned and this started, I was seriously injured, resulting in major hip surgery that a year later I'm still recovering from.

Recently I have come to find out our lack of sex has nothing to do with any of those things. In reality its because he's severely passive aggressive, how he never takes blame for anything, his anger issues, his lack of intimacy but no problem taking a blow job and never reciprocating, all the lies, frequently moody but always claiming nothing was wrong...

Withholding sex is his way of punishing me  for doing things that upsets him, and keeping it from me was more important than opening up and telling me what was wrong. And it has the added bonus of avoiding something that helps form an emotional connection.

I don't know if he's going to truly change and not be passive aggressive anymore. He's in counseling

I wonder how many people are in passive aggressive relationships and not mismatched libidos? I'm hoping by sharing my story others can relate with encouragement

Background: We've been dating for two years. I love him with all of my heart. We're both young (mid 20s), albeit it is good when he actually gets into it. 


This morning I felt his morning wood against me, so I would appreciate any help you can give in order to get my message across. 



**The letter:** 


""I feel hurt. I think you are perfect and amazing in every other way except for the sex frequency category. The thing is- sex is very very important to me. And it’s not about having an orgasm. Its not about feeling a hard dick. It’s about me feeling like a woman, and loved. 


I need this intimacy to truly feel fulfilled in a relationship- and I’m not crazy or a slut for needing that. It is normal. I don’t want to feel like a chore. I want to feel like someone cares about me enough to lick me up and down and make me feel like a queen. Maybe that makes me selfish


It hurts to feel such strong sexual feelings toward you, because I feel like it was just an act, or I somehow didn’t perform well enough for you. I understand you don’t feel like doing anything when your stomach hurts, and there’s not much that can be done about that. 


Except
 These are the places my mind goes when you haven’t shown interest in me in weeks… all the while dropping hints that you’re going to “do me soon.” I don’t get my hopes up anymore

Over a decade ago

For the past 6 months, it's ""my"" problem. Not ""ours"".

A month ago we had good sex on a saturday morning, etc...  The week following I noticed that the initiating of everything seemed to be a silent reponsability of mine.  If I didn't kiss her when she got back from work (I am always home before her), she certainly would not initiate it. This realization depressed me greatly. I tried to keep my spirits up.

Two weeks ago, as it really feels about one notch higher than rape, that's it. After that event, at that point, I decided to just give up.  I just stopped initiating anything.

So, period.

Fast forward to last night. We go to bed, and not even a goodnight kiss. That's the first time in two decades.  I fell asleep for a few minutes and then woke right back up.  I spent the rest of the night fighting with myself on how totally fucked up my life was.  I crave affection with someone who could be perfectly happy with being roomates and fucking once every few months.  Put two kids in the mix, and my mind is pretty much fit to be tied. I have been in this situation on and off for more than 15 years.

I'm 25, F, and was likewise until ~6 months ago when we had our first child. Since then, her libido has been non existent.

We have -- had -- what I consider a very healthy sex life. Near the start of the relationship it was amazing - we would experiment, in malls, outdoors, etc. There have always been plenty of orgasms on both sides (she had never orgasmed before me). We had sex-filled vacations, and in general had it multiple times a day, she would wake me up for sex even if I'd only had 3 hours sleep that day, and I would always get up and perform my duty no matter how tired I was... it was great. There were a few minor issues - I sometimes like my woman to really go the extra mile for me, strip tease, after having 7 squirting orgasms or so, really put my girl through her through her paces... but all in all things were grand

All throughout the pregnancy, perhaps, but still fine. Due to the pregnancy, we couldn't go at it as hard as we used to, and many positions were off limits... also, we were extremely busy at the time, what with the wedding planning, and adjusting to living together, as I considered this all to be a transitional period, it's for my baby right? 2 months is not a long time.

She ended up having a c section, and one day I wake up to a freshly showered, naked, anxious but happy wife snuggled in bed next to me. One thing leads to another, we take it very slow and gentle, but then... it hurts. I cannot recall her ever being that tight. A lot of decidedly unsexy struggling, poking and prodding ensues. We do finally manage to do the deed, and only missionary.  She seemed relieved when it was over.

That all I could handle - in fact, eventually we'll get back into the swing of things and be going at it full tilt like usual.

Of course, or even the next room... someone has to be watching baby or she can't relax enough to get into it. Ok, understandable. Problem was, she was too nervous to hand baby over to just anyone - it had to be one of a few specific family members, all of whom are themselves fairly busy. Even when the criteria were met and we were getting into it, though, I could tell part of her mind was still elsewhere, given the fact that these family members of hers are not too keen on watching a wailing baby for very long

Fast forward another 2 sexless months. After lots of communication, and decide baby is old enough to have some different people caring for her. We decide to set aside a day for couple-time-plus-sex whenever we can. This is 100% me pushing for all this, by the way; I'm sure the pattern is familiar to most of you. We ask another young mom we know to watch the baby, go through the usual routine - god I hate that word - shower, have foreplay, go down to the room, more foreplay, struggle to insert penis for several minutes

Is this the turning of a new leaf? Maybe the start of regularly occuring sex sessions which will allow my wife's vagina to become reacquianted with its good buddy in a way that allows for easier access and eventually better sex times (as I desperately hope?) Unfortunately not. No sooner had I found a way to deal with the baby situation than 'I'm not in the mood because of baby' became 'I'm just not in the mood.' With some of the distractions cleared away, she just wasn't into sex as much as before.

I should mention here that I suffer one character flaw - perhaps a strength, passive, and complacent in an earlier relationship which ended up crashing and burning. Since then, I decided I will not allow me or the person I am with to be unhappy in any way. I just simply will not allow it.

In this case, but the temptation to was fierce. I just felt irritable, impatient and snappy... no matter what she did or said some part of my mind was 'yeah yeah yeah that's nice and all BUT GIVE ME SOME SEX.' I did not feel like my usual cheerful, capable, confident, happy self. I mean, I just don't think it's possible to feel that way without being able to have sex with the woman I live with, and gave my life to be with.

The next 2 months of my life were spent in what I guess is the usual HL with LL pattern. Me searching obsessively for information on female low libido and how to cure/manage it, pampering your girl, romancing her with candle lit dinners and flowers and just waiting on her hand and foot. When my wife trotted out that laundry list of issues that she wanted fixed so she could MAYBE feel in the mood to sleep with me, it was one of the most stressful, depressing moments of my life. I quickly realized though, it was just her mind fumbling around for stuff that might be the cause of the problem, when in reality neither of us knew what it really was.

I remember being in the kitchen one day, being her human comfy chair and listening to her gab about her friends on facebook, and so forth. Whilst washing dishes, my mind was, as always, filled with endless erotic thoughts about how much I want to caress, tease, and basically just fuck the living shit out of my wife. Reminiscing inwardly about the vain manner by which I was striving to achieve that goal. All the romantic notes, back massages, particularly as far as spending time with her to be ""intimate with no sex"".

So yeah. There I am standing in front of the sink after a long, and mostly unfulfilling day, after nearly a year of almost no sex with my beloved wife. Thinking about what else I can possibly do. And suddenly it just hits me all at once, like a physical blow. I am not happy. I don't feel good at all. I feel, in fact, like a pile of fly ridden, crusty shit.

This was about the point in time where I discovered r/deadbedrooms. I already knew I could not be the only man with this problem

So, and gently but firmly explain to her that I am fucking miserable due to lack of sex with her, and try to figure out together what we can do to resolve it. I can't remember what exactly was said, but we ended up scheduling another sex session for that weekend.

My god, but just knowing I could make love to my wife finally, after all that hope, despair, frustration and blue balling, was just... incredible. We made love the first day and she came plenty, no squirting or anything, all smiles

However, and reflecting on my own, I knew that what I really wanted wasn't just sex, although that's part of it, what I want is my wife to WANT to have sex with me again.

And... now we've reached the real problem. Because after communicating, treat well, and love dearly... whose body is perfectly capable of sex, can crave sex, and even make her beg for sex, does not WANT sex mentally. Many threads I read here mention 'letting your body lead your mind instead of waiting for your mind to lead your body.' I have brought this up with my wife several times, and her answer is that she doesn't want to have duty sex, the few times she managed to have sex with me after the baby were a result of intense mental preparation lasting days

I do not feel comfortable with this. I do not feel comfortable with the idea of raping my wife, and that the effort leaves her spiritually drained and that it's some huge ordeal for her. God dammit, I want my wife to WANT to have sex with me, not want to have sex with me on some distant meta level that can only translate into actual sex through some herculean feat of will.

After some time spent coping with all these hard truths, which also coincides neatly with the time she first started seriously not wanting sex. I desperately want her to remove this infernal contraption from her body. She is, unfortunately, terrified of getting pregnant again... one baby is already so much to handle, and such a huge change. She says 'wait til I stop breastfeeding and then we'll see. Please be patient.' I would love to be patient. I am, however, fucking miserable and it is only getting worse. I fap, I hide my emotions, maybe.

Anyway. Just wanted to throw my story out, but I can't always be talking to her about it because it will spoil all the time we spend together - but in my mind it's always there. Thanks for reading and letting me vent.

I'm 25F, I always thought. I've gone very long periods without sex with no distress. Never been a huge priority for me. My boyfriend is 28, LL. Well, absolutely no libido. We have been in a relationship for almost a year, dated casually even longer. 

I could count the number of times we have had sex on one fingerless hand.

Like I said, I [stupidly] thought I hit the boyfriend jackpot. I'm used to dating people with a disproportionately higher sex drive than me and thought this would be awesome. 

It was awesome

But it also feels so *hollow*.

I can't remember the last time he didn't turn his face away from mine after a quick kiss. 

He's never initiated anything sexual. An occasional grope

The times I have tried to initiate sex, he's had his T levels tested, asked doctors about it, no solutions, but says he wants this, he wants me, he's attracted to me

We are both always stupid busy, it hurts to think about. The topic tends to ""bother"" me only about once a month, to maybe explain how we've gotten this far without any resolution. I dunno.

The last time it came up, don't you ever want to get off? He says he masturbates and watches porn. I found that site yourbrainonporn.com and sent him a link to it because it seemed possible it could be the issue. I don't know. He got the message. I mean, he physically got the email I sent with the link, but has never mentioned it to me, and has since looked at porn so I guess didn't really care or take it seriously. 

I didn't notice my self esteem was disappearing, because I hate myself. I hate myself for needing sex. 

One time recently he had been flirty all night, I was absolutely certain we were going to do something. He kissed me again and said goodnight, and turned away to sleep. I was stunned. I've never been *mad* about this before that night. I stayed awake in bed until almost 5am, silently crying and being mad, mad at him for being like this and mad at myself for wanting it enough for it to make me MAD. Anger is the single most out of character emotion for me, it just isn't a natural state for me to be in. He woke up to my crying and asked me what was wrong, he really had no idea. I said nothing for a minute because I couldn't say what I needed to. I eventually said I was crying because I couldn't sleep. He cuddled me and fell back asleep. 

I once researched health blogs and other sites to find out about how to increase your libido, that's kind of messed up.

1361422755.0,18xqdt,Finally some understanding and hope.,LadyThrowaway00,24,4,6,"First time posting. I have lurked this subreddit for awhile and have been dealing with a DB for close to a year now. With encounters happening as little as once every 2-3 months. Dealt with it for a long time because my SO had a very labor intensive job and I understood he was tired at the end of the day. Had 'the talk' quite a few times. I would always explain how it didn't have to be PIV sex I just wanted some 'us' time. His response was always either ""I'm tired"" or ""I don't know what to tell you"". Offered lots of blowjobs thinking 'hey

Finally I decided to try one more time and wrote him a letter. In the letter I explained how him ignoring me like that made me feel awful. I told him how complete strangers who catcall me in public made me feel more desired than he did and how that fact disgusted and upset me. I said that I needed to feel like I was attractive to him and how the whole situation had made me really insecure and made me feel like there was something wrong with me. Telling me I am pretty occasionally and flirting with me only after I have flirted with him and made it obvious I would like a response was not enough to make me feel like he desired me. I begged him to tell me what the problem was

This finally struck a cord with him. I gave it to him one morning and that evening we talked about it. He said that I was right about him not putting in any effort and admitted that he had this problem before. He told me that it was hard for him to think of me as as sex object (not the best word for it but I understood what he meant) because he was in love with me. He said he had separated love and sex for so long it was hard for him to put the two back together but that he did not realize the toll this took on me emotionally and how bad it made me feel. He assured me that he is attracted to me and desires me and that he will work on making sure I am very well aware of it. Even told me if he starts slipping up and returning to his old ways to tell him immediately and not to wait and let it build it up. This is the first time he has been this open with me about this subject and this has renewed my hope for us.

I am also going to do more to let him know how much I want him. Going to tell him how often I think about him

1361324577.0,18uvqs,This could go wrong... but doing it anyway.,itwasntplanned,28,8,7,"HL(m) together with wife (LL) for 21 years. DB for at least 4 years (less than once a month). It has been 5 weeks since our last encounter if you don't count an aborted one three weeks ago (kids interrupted).

So here is what I want to do. I want to wait until she initiates.  We have gone six months without sex in the past and although it was pretty hellish at the time I found reddit a month or so ago and it has given me a new perspective on things. Which fills me with confidence that I can at least try.

I never completely understood when she said I was harassing her for sex. I heard the words and promised to do it  less  (and did) but never honestly 'got it'. I have read enough posts from LL partners here to finally get some understanding and this is one of the reasons I want to do this. There are other reasons including body image issues on her part (she is now running everyday and loving it after decades of me telling her how great it is for your self esteem... only took some other mums from the kid's school to make her take it up.. bah humbug) and some changes I want to do for myself.

I am going to give myself a makeover (clothes, maybe even eating habits, friends, etc) and generally just go back to being who I was when we first met. It is going to be tough specially at the beginning but I have come to realize that I have let myself go in the past 8 years partly as a result of depression after a change of careers. We had planned for me to be a stay at home husband for 5 years but after I left my job and was set to go she chickened out and reneged on the deal. The reasons why she chickened out were valid but it was mostly about her using her low earning potential as an excuse for not even trying. This was a devastating event for me because it was something we had put into our life plan since the beginning many years prior. I struggled for 4 years to get over it. 

I made the decision to try this recently after she commented on my weight a week or two ago. I agreed she was right about it and said I was actually thinking about doing something about it (have been for a couple of months). I wasn't hurt about the weight comment

What can go wrong? I might not pull it off to starters, I am to the point I care very little if that were to happen.


**TL



**UPDATE: Week 1**. Thought about ""reseting the counter"" at the beginning of the week. She had a REAL migraine for two days. No dice. Started running/cycling. Knees very tender. Lots of icing. Still working up to a daily routine (knees main factor). Joined local sports team. So far so good.

SO says she was thinking about getting a treadmill for herself and now that I am exercising it is easier to justify the $$.

Innocent comment in bed got me a ""don't ask for sex now"" death stare last night. I honestly wasn't asking. Maybe I should not make ambiguous comments while lying in bed naked. ;-)


**UPDATE: Week 2**. SO seems a little more affectionate. Almost as if she missed some of my 'harrasment'.  Went furniture shopping (for the living room) with mixed results. It was a great shared experience until it came to decision time. I mentioned moving the location of the TV and it we ended up tiring ourselves out discussing the possibilities. No big deal except for her parting comment ""you always do this""... 

Work was extremely busy which helped keep my mind off sex. Made a new female friend. I used to have lots of female friends before. I forgot how fun it was.

**UPDATE:
Week 3**: Ditched work for the weekend (making an effort to not work on the weekends). SO noticed and was seemingly happy about it.  She also mentioned that I was sexually harassing her IN HER DREAMS... gee fucking wheez... I tried to laugh it off but it hurt.  

Exercise is getting better. Knees don't hurt as much. Doing 3X1 hour sessions per week. No change in weight though. Also trying to do away with midnight snacks (trying to not wake up at 2 am in the first place)

So standard story, guy marries girl, kids come, and sex drops WAY off.  My oldest child is 8, and since she was born there has been a lack of intimacy.  We went through several periods where we would have sex once every two months.  I'm aware there's much worse stories out there, but coming from what we had it was quite a change.

Fine, sex takes less precedence as the relationship ages -- but not to the degree it has.  She was well aware I was a highly sexed person, and billed herself as someone more than willing to reciprocate.  Come to find out, that's not exactly the case.  Sounding like a classic bait/switch yet?

So I tried many different approaches to get things going again.  Many things I've tried I've come to find from reading this forum were probably mistakes.  About a year ago I bought the ""sex starved marriage"" and delivered it to my wife along with a lengthy letter in which I spilled my guts.  I told her how much I needed her, and when she came back there was much crying, talking, and promises made to fulfill needs.

And it worked.... for a while.  We actually settled on approximately once a week.  And it was going off without a hitch for a few months.  Then things started to come up, depending on your perspective).  

So about a month ago I gently reminded her of our conversation from a year ago

So her response was along the lines of ""well if you just need to get off then just fuck me right now and get it over with.""  Despite the fact that I've explained more times than I can count that sex with my wife is about far more than ""getting off"".

But I did.  I fucked her with as much passion and love as I could muster under the circumstances, when it happens it’s still very good for both parties.  This time though she steadfastly refused to get into it.  In retrospect I should have just quit and not finished and let her know that her actions were as bad, if not worse, than denying sex completely.  But being the weak person that I am at times, I finished up and wrote it off as a fluke.

But I didn't do that tonight.  Tonight I brought sex up, oral, teasing.... basically all the things that I know should have been triggers for her.  Eventually I started doing ""my thing"", but stupidly still trying to get some interest I suppose I took longer than I should have.  She asked me if I ""would be done soon"". 

And that was the end of it.  I stopped, sitting in the booth and bawling my eyes out the whole time.  I'm sure it was probably a weird sight, but I couldn't really muster up the energy to care.

I came home after a couple of hours and told her ""I will never ask for sex from you or mention sex to you again - that's probably easier for both of us.""  I'm not sure if that was a good thing to say or not

[Her response to anyone curious was along the lines of ""I don't want that but you make me feel like it's a chore"".  I really wasn't sure how to reply to that considering the 10

And now here I sit upstairs.  I feel emotionally amped up yet vacant at the same time.  I don't think that makes sense but I don't know how else to describe it.  I did mean what I said.  I won't subject myself to her rejection or reluctant compliance ever again.  I fully intend to never so much as mention it to her again.

So here I am with some decisions to make.  Of course these are all complicated by kids and an otherwise happy home.  

I am not denying myself sex.  I've gotten over feeling selfish for making it a make-or-break issue.  I believe I deserve a healthy relationship where each partner woks hard to satisfy the other's needs.

I've turned down opportunities even very recently because I want to be with my wife, and loving) but I'm not willing to deny myself meaningful human connection for the next 15 years.

I lied a bit.  After typing that I still feel like a selfish asshole for considering breaking up my family over ""just sex"" (although I'm sure most of you realize that it's far from ""just sex"").  

So I really have no idea what the fuck to do.  I'm never attempting to have sex with that woman again.  The misery it causes me just isn't worth the occasional pleasant encounter.  I'm not willing to forego sex until my kids are grown.  Having a girlfriend just isn't what I want to do
If you read this far then I thank you for your patience.  I don’t really know what kind of feedback I’m looking for – I just really needed to get this off my chest.

Age 16 - Starts taking showers with girls at partys and becoming more sexual than just kissing.
Age 17 - Has a threesome with her friend and her friend's boyfriend. She loved being eaten out by a girl and was eating out her friend. The boyfriend rapes her weeks later while she is drunk. 
Age 18 - Meets me
Age 19-20 - She still has dreams about her crush Sarah and other girls that are very sexual. We have sex maybe once a month, so she has me suck on her nipples and slap her ass until she is done. I told her that if she wants to date a girl to see if it makes her happier then she can go ahead and do it. She refuses, but is curious. After she watches a lesbian shower orgy video, I put an ad on craigslist for a lesbian shower orgy for her. She is really excited about it, but feels bad and doesn't want to go through with it. She is very conflicted about her feelings from a religious standpoint and because she has an aversion to divorce from her parents and grandparents. After seeing her facebook message one of the many girls she had kissed and asking if she was still lesbian, I decided to put this on reddit as I feel like the evidence is stacked, I haven't been happy since we got married (1.5 years now) and she seems completely uninterested in me sexually and emotionally.

I got caught up in raising kids and running the house along with working a busy full time job. Did I lose my way? I don't think so

Our sex life was so-so then, she does not touch me and says she gives me all she can, which is a big nothing. She loves me to rub and tickle her backside, but if I reach around to the front, then I am the pig who only wants sex.

My plan is to discuss it with her this weekend while we are doing some spring cleaning in the yard. My hope is to explain to her how I am missing our sense of closeness

I'm nearly 24, but he wanted to keep it. He said he'd always found pregnant women sexy, but guess what, sex once while I was pregnant and none after whatsoever.

He used to be the initiator - you know, I asked all the time, but of course got rejected. I don't ask anymore. I think he lost sexual interest in me. Really. His eyes are never passionate, his body language never inviting. When some random guy on the street looks my way I'm genuinely surprised, because I've felt so ugly and hopeless all this time. He is emotionally abusive.

Sex is only part of our problem, clean and cook; he stays home and collects unemployment, and ""takes care"" of our son but does a bad job imo. I tell him to go out, and hang out with friends, whatever - but he is a total geek. Just wants to stay home and play video games. So, fine. But here's the thing. He is so friendly, too friendly, ""Why are you spending 5 hours straight talking to her? I'm right here! Of course I'm jealous

I'm irrational if I ever bring this up, ANY friends, because I'd eventually talk about my horrid relationship and they'd lose all respect for me(it's happened before). So I am, apart from my son and cats, alone. It's hard. I could write a novel but this is enough for one night. The end. :(

1330565947.0,qc8c5,I think I have given up,throwy123456,24,4,38,"Hello everyone

My girlfriend and I are 29 and been in a relationship for 3 years.

After the 6 month mark sex dropped down to near non existent because of an issue she was having with the pill and needed some minor surgery for.  I think this was more to do with the honeymoon period ending rather than that issue. So sex because extremely rare and I would say about once a month.

So we talked about it and things got better for awhile(improvement for 1-2 weeks) but sure enough they drop back to once a month. This has happened repeatably during our relationship.

So I just gave up

The main thing that gets me is she blames my lack of initiating when honestly it doesn't matter, can't have eaten in the last few hours, too tired, just woke up, isn't feeling well, is hungry, etc. She is just using these as excuses because when she is in the mood everything above doesn't matter.

The rare times when she wants it is usually a really bad time like after I have been asleep for an hour

I am so over the double standard I honestly think I have stopped seeing her in a sexual way.  I still care for her and I do want sex but I don't think I see her sexually.  I am bitter over this whole issue and it doesn't seem to matter how much we talk about it things will always revert back to they always do.  It probably wouldn't be so bad except there is a dash of hypocricy in there as well.

There was something she wanted me to do awhile ago and she offered giving me head as a motivator to do it. (I was annoyed she was using sex as a bargaining chip and let her know it)  She said oh she wasn't it was a bit of fun and she wants to.  So I did it and she never delivered

We have tried taking her off the pill and it had little to no effect apart from the initial burst which happens when I drop the ultimatium anyway.

I have told her I am not prepared to be in a sexless relationship and I am over giving that ultimatium

So I did eventually get everything set up and sat him down and had the talk, I assumed he also thought it was a dead relationship since he'd been uninterested for so long; was just hoping for non-violent resolution.

Apparently I was wrong about a lot.  The man hit bottom and bounced.  Turned his attitude upside down

Still no sex.

Then he did discover I was cheating, thinking, ""well, maybe I should just have an affair?  But how could I ever find someone?"" when a man walked up and...And how it had Really Changed Me Sexually, that I had now a partner who loved my body - MY body, and was so far ahead of me and that now I could enjoy so many things that I never even knew about, mindblowingly awesome sex.  I ended up apologizing for the bad sex that we had had before

After the initial shock, other stuff.

He said better for me to keep seeing the FWB as he was not going to be able to do as much as I would want, to explore with someone else if he likes.

I would never have predicted this in a million years.

I'm a healthy 26 year old guy in a dead bedroom situation myself

***Masturbating

That doesn't mean that it makes it impossible for me to have sex or orgasm, I usually go through my entire day without getting horny.  This is on purpose, because I don't want to be too tempted to cheat on my wife.  I can look at hot women and appreciate their beauty, but I don't get an uncontrollable ""i want to fuck her right now"" feeling like I do if I don't masturbate.  Actually, I get that feeling around most women, not just hot ones, if I hadn't masturbated.

Because I have masturbated earlier in the day, I'll get horny and ready to go, but it's not hormones that are driving me to the bedroom, it's the knowledge that I'll have a good time.  I never have a problem getting hard once we start making out, but I don't get horny just by looking at her.

For science, the next one hardcore porn, and the final some very BDSM rough stuff.  The last few were also really difficult, like the mood had to be just right and everything had to be perfect.  I've read a comment in this reddit where a woman said her man masturbated 8 times a day and watched transsexual, bondage porn.  That comes as no surprise to me because it takes stuff that intense to do it the 8th time.

So my advice to the women out there in this situation

(1) Convince him to go for 2-3 days without masturbating at all, ""you are not against masturbation"", ""you do not have a problem with it"", ""you are not forbidding him from it"", ""it is only for a few days"".  The worst thing you can say is that he's never allowed to masturbate again, because he will REALLY resent you, and will do it behind your back anyways.

(2) Catch him in the morning

(3) Convince him through logic and reason that even though he isn't feeling like sex right now, if I've masturbated twice in a day before sex, it takes a lot of effort to stay hard, so this approach will probably backfire.",,False,,False,t3_oukbv

Eventually it got to the point where she'd reject me 90% of the time, but she does not at all.

Even when I do initiate, I actually try to initiate sex last week.    She did not respond, and basically fell asleep.    Of course, I was hurt that she didn't try, but I chalked it up to how broken our sex life is and I basically gave up on it.

So a few days later - on Friday - she says she's sorry for rejecting me and she knows it isn't okay.    I just say okay.

Friday night, but basically was a dead fish.  No reaction at all.   Rather than having sex with someone that has no intention of liking it, I opted to go to bed.   She also dozed off a bit as well, no luck there.    Who knows if she was faking it.

So

She was trying to initiate something.  She's not very good at being direct

I close myself off to avoid pain, but there's no desire there.  She knew she was ""in trouble"" and that she should want to have sex with me and not reject me, but she didn't want me sexually.

We started off as really good friends, but she wanted to wait, and I was fine with that. We waited, got to know each other more intimately, and became even better friends. It was great. 

About six months after we started dating, but the most she ever wanted it was once a week. And I would have even been okay with that, but even when we did have sex, it was like she wanted to get it over with as fast as possible. Eventually it became even less frequent than that, and I couldn't even enjoy the times we did have sex because all I could think about was how long it would be before we did it again.

I started to share my feelings about the situation, about a year after we started having sex) she decided she didn't want to have sex at all anymore. She said that it was just something she didn't look forward to, and she always felt stressed about it. I think a lot of that had to do with me putting too much pressure on her. She told me she didn't think it would happen again anytime soon. I told her I was okay with all of that, because I definitely didn't want to be pressuring her and I didn't want her to feel uncomfortable.

She's not a very sexual person. She doesn't have fantasies, and she doesn't really think about sex at all. Because of this, things seemed pretty hopeless to me at this point. So asked her to start exploring her sexuality, in hopes that maybe she would find something within herself and want to start back again. I just wanted some hope. She agreed to this, and said she would do it on her own time.

Now it's been about six months since that conversation, but I still walk around feeling unfulfilled and rejected most of the time. She hasn't masturbated at all.

It hurts whenever I think about it, and I think about what it would be like to be with someone who genuinely wants to have sex with me. I've been thinking about that more and more lately.

I try not to say anything, but sometimes I think she's just telling me what I want to hear. Sometimes I think she'll never truly enjoy it, and I'm doomed to a dead bedroom if I stay with her. 

I brought it up again today, and hope she eventually comes around. Sometimes I think I'm wasting my time. But I'll probably end up waiting, trying to keep on hoping, because I really do love her. She's become my best friend, and just being with her makes me so happy, and that helps me to forget about the sex for a while. But the thoughts always come back, and it's so hard to ignore this part of me that's always in my head.

EDIT: I just realized I left out a pretty important detail. Sometimes the sex was painful for her, but it's probably still a big part of it. 

The problem is that she doesn't even want to consider it an issue. I've tried to share with her that it's a huge issue for me, she doesn't even think about it.

As the title says


I've tried to get myself in the mood using different strategies such as exercising more, eating better, having a few drinks to loosen up, and all that other good stuff. Combined they sort of help.

When we do have sex it's fantastic. We communicate openly and have similar interests. Despite reassuring him that I find him very attractive and that he's great in bed

The root of the problem is a combination of things. I was sexually assaulted a few times as a young teen. When I'm not in the mood and he initiates sex it makes me anxious. On the one hand I want to try to work up some arousal so we can bone

The other issue is that sometimes my body seems unresponsive or turned off by touch. I hate having my breasts touched when I'm not aroused, like my arm. I feel like a plastic doll.


So what do? I would love to have sex on a regular basis to replace my negative sexual memories with positive ones, but having something to get the ball rolling while I start going to therapy would be amazing. It just seems like most libido-enhancing drugs on the market are either ineffective or shady. Recommendations or warnings welcome!

In the beginning, a hot weekend of endless sex that was mindblowing. It was passionate, acrobatic, crazy.

When we moved in together the sex continued but as time went on it dropped and dropped. 

I got to a point where I didn't want to be touched. We would lay in bed, and I didn't want him going down on me so I never let him. We didn't hold hands. I'd still rub his back from time to him and I'd give him hugs but that was all. We were like sort of close roommates who occasionally had awkward sex.
 
My libido dips coincided with periods of depression for me. Instead of bouncing back
 
We each still used porn and masturbated. I would say at least once or twice a day for each of us we'd watch porn and get off rather than be intimate with one another. 

During a fight about a year ago, and why wasn't he enough? He broke down crying in a way I have never, ever seen another person and I have never in my life felt like such a complete piece of shit as I did then.
  
In the month following I did a lot of soul searching. I felt like I hadn't really been taking responsibility for my sexuality and for my sexual pleasure. My libido had flagged and I had blamed it on him

I sat my husband down and I told him that shit had to change but that I needed his help. I laid my sexual soul bare to him: I told him that if he wanted me to blow him to completion he needed to promise eat more fruit or else his cum tasted too funny, not even jokingly, because it made me associate his touch with something unsexy and I hated that (I am ticklish to a fault). I told him that I am really into anal and really into fingering even if he isn't, and I'm going to buy toys to explore that on my own but that I plan on using them in bed to use on myself in tandem with what he does to me, and I hoped he could accept that (he could). I told him I knew he preferred untamed pubic hair but I preferred myself smooth and I needed to be comfortable to feel sexy and empowered (he accepted that too). Basically every single little issue, hang up, little thing I had kept quiet on or not acknowledged or ignored I brought up and talked about. He brought up his own things.

For us, imagining myself doing that with my husband while I watch. Reducing our porn consumption individually and as a couple was very helpful.

I won't lie and say the road has been easy. When I am stressed or sad or anxious, I owe it to us as a couple to make the effort. I need to nurture and care for my libido as much if not more than he does. It's MY body, it's MY sex drive and thus, it's MY responsibility. 

At this point I will say though that the ""effort"" feels more and more like nothing. I look at him and want to make out with him. I want to touch him. I want to grab him and pull him close. At night when I wake up entangled in his arms I wish he didn't need his rest for work in the morning because half the time I'd love to wake him up just to fuck. When he does something in bed that I don't like, I am very direct and tell him how much I love it. He does the same with me. When we first got together it felt like we fucked like hormonal teenagers.. needy, breathless, each selfish and pursuing our own pleasure and frankly using one another's body as a masturbation device as a means to an end. Since becoming a dead bedroom couple and finding our way back, it feels like we fuck differently now, like adults, like two parts of a whole. It really feels like we made a huge leap from amateurs to pro

I can honestly say I am a lot happier as a whole now too. Our relationship outside of the sex has always been great but outside of the lack of sex I have always been plagued by feelings of guilt and inadequecy and fear because of it. Not only are we having tons of sex again but I finally feel a security I hadn't realized I had lost. 

So what was the point of this? A few things. First is that I've lurked r/deadbedrooms a lot. While I don't doubt that lots of LL partners are dealing with things like hormones, but remember it's not some permanent indictment to admit you may have fucked up, nor does it absolve your partner of any responsibility. Just realize that it isn't about the blame, it's about recognizing patterns and behavior and fixing it. And realize that if you love your partner and want your love to last and your life to be better as a whole, you will commit to fixing your shit. And if your shit as a couple is your sex life, then that is the shit you will fix come hell or high water, no excuses.

Second thing is in lurking I've seen a lot of HL people in here despairing. Despairing because things are okay for a month then goes to shit. Despairing because there's a fear if they push the issue, but I felt like it may be helpful to see a case where a dead bedroom truly was reborn without the ugly baggage and false starts and problems. There is hope.
So that's my story and observations and lessons and I hope all of you awesome people get your relationships on whatever track they need to be and get to lots of loving. I wanted LL's to know they can turn things around and HL's to know their relationships aren't necessarily over.

I’ve given into that time and time again, being romantic, no pressure, no expectations. Nothing on birthdays, nothing on mood-setting dates. I’m at a complete loss.

1352572275.0,12z0nj,never thought this would be us...(warning - long),throwingaway9,24,4,20,"First time poster/long time lurker. I'm 34(m)

I read a lot about HL and LL on here, I masturbate infrequently, etc. When my libido has been allowed to play out naturally, I average 2 times on the weekend and sometimes once during the week. Maybe I just misunderstand the distinction. I'm not beta either, though I am considerate and do the lion's share of chores and things; I have always just had a natural tendency to keep busy. I'm in good shape, I'm outgoing, pretty independent and adventurous. 

I feel like I've lost my ability to initiate, is that rejection has often been paired with - A. things about me that prevent her from wanting to have sex or B. her personal problems that make me feel guilty about trying. For example, if I get frustrated with my job, finances, home repairs, then I hear my off-putting personality prevents her from wanting to be intimate with me. Not necessarily on the same day, mind you; I could have had a terrific day

When I'd like to be intimate, we're alone, I feel attracted to her, and I get the feeling I want to initiate, I know I am just as likely, or more likely, to be hurt when I want intimacy

I'm sure some of you can relate to this. You can also probably relate to the fact that she is cognizant of both my desire for intimacy and my inability to initiate and she knows how to easily avoid me. Of course, no kisses, no holding hands...anything she feels might lead to sex. She stays up late, goes to bed complaining of how soon morning will arrive, or, if we can sleep in, food will invariably disagree with her right before bed. Of course, but if I try to have sex

A side note to LL women - if you've prevented your boyfriend/husband from having sex for weeks, do not act hurt he doesn't want to spoon you. Sexual frustration is physically and emotionally uncomfortable. You know that trick they teach to dogs where the trainer balances a treat on the dog's nose and the dog is supposed to sit still and not eat it? The only difference here is the dog eventually gets to eat the treat.

I've tried ""the talk"" a thousand times, that I find her attractive, etc. I've tried to just talk about sex like it is something fun and exciting. When she has told me things to try, I've tried them, though she will invariably deny my efforts the next time I try to talk about it.  

For years I was pretty against smoking weed, freeing me from the physiological frustration of my libido. If you don't have an addictive personality and live somewhere they allow medical, it's pretty great, but it's much more of a way to avoid the problem than to solve it. Case in point - I've actually envied our pets because she dotes on them and says she loves them; that's pretty fucking sad. Sorry about the rant. ",,False,,1352572700.0,t3_12z0nj

Ive posted in the past about my dying bedroom [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/119hhr/boring_bedroom_but_not_dead_yet/). The wife and I had a in depth chat about 2 weeks ago. She noticed that I had been short with her and spending most of my free time doing other things away from her. I admitted that I had mostly withdrawn from the relationship and that Ive given up any hope that things would change. She asked me if we weren't married (and only dating) if I would have broken up with her already. I told her yes.

She promised that she would fix things and asked for me to forget the past so we could start fresh. I got upset. I asked her why it took the realization that I was leaving for her to 'get it'. Why couldn't she make the effort months ago after we had 'the talk' for the umpteenth time?

We talked about counseling, messy, etc), but no matter what therapy accomplishes, our sex life will never be perfect or 'fulfilling' for me. Her grinning and bearing it inst sexy, and she just doesn't have the drive or curiosity that I do.  

**So herein lies my issue.** Im tired of always being the one who has to compromise. Im tired of never being able to be myself. I feel that when push comes to shove

Now I know that the above paragraph might make me sound selfish, both with our sex life, her career, the house responsibilities, our pets, etc. 

So how do i swallow my pride and this resentment and try to see if there is any chance of improving our relationship? Ive just gotten so beaten up over the past from being rejected and my needs being her last priority. I REALLY dislike her right now and I hate that I am filled with so much negativity right now.

The marriage as a whole has been decent over the past 7 years.  We've been through ups and downs like most people.  We have a lot to be thankful for that we've worked hard to get: house, dog, standard of living.  We're finally out of debt and just starting to enjoy less budgeting.  Over the last 2 years or maybe longer the sex has almost stopped.  I have to beg/plead/guilt/ask to get sex twice a month and sometimes it's less than that.  This has led to a LOT of resentment and anger on my part, but I'm sure it's made her angry too.  It also makes me insecure in my relationship and marriage.  This is a problem because my happiness is so reliant on my marriage and identity in that.  I've tried to talk to her some about the problem, but mostly it was too passive to be productive.  I don't usually have a problem fighting or arguing with people, but I do with my wife for some reason.

Recently we had a big fight about it, and I don't want to have sex with you if I'm not comfortable.  We only have surface level talks about what's going on with our son etc, nothing deeper and we're more like roomates.""  To which I responded, ""I know.  I've felt like this for a long time.  I've been trying to do nice things for you for a while now so we do still feel like we're dating, but you keep meeting me with resistance.  I need sex to be part of the equation and I can't keep going on like this without it.  Recently I put a note in your bag when you left town that told you how much I loved you and that I'd miss you while you were gone.  Did you get it?  If you did you never told me.  You never said thanks, or I appreciate it, or I love/miss you too.  I tried holding you hand all day a month ago, you're clinging to me like our child.""  I'm not happy with things

We've been married for 7 years and were friends for 8 before that.  What ""deep"" conversation is there left to have?  What does she mean emotional connection is gone?  How is it I can rub her back in bed 6 nights a week when I'm home (giving her what she wants) and I'm left not getting what I need (sex).  

I'm an awesome Dad, a good friend/neighbor, and Mr. Fix everything.  I give and give and give, and I don't know what else to do.  I'm miserable because of the lack of sex.  It's making me insecure on many levels.  I mentioned that we go see couples therapy which she agreed to, but ""doesn't know when we'll have time to do it.""  I feel like going may doom our marriage because how many successful marriages actually go to counseling? I feel like I give 90% and she gives 10%.  Anytime we ""talk"" we basically fight and I do not fight well with her.

On another note medically she's on anti-depressants (Buspirone but it's not an SSRI) and has an IUD (Mirena) which she's had for 3 years.  She also takes Tamazapam for sleep aid.   I also know she's slightly anemic but she takes a multi vitamin.  I have no health issues at all. Edit:  I think I might be depressed and easy to anger because of everything but as a pilot I can't take anything. 

Maybe a year ago we had a week where we had sex 3 days in a row.  She was laying in bed next to me and said, it's awesome.  I think it's the frequency of sex that lets us feel this way"".  I guess it didn't sink in.

I'm hoping the experience of people here can help guide me.  What do I do?   If I think of more I'll write more soon.  I'm kinda afraid to bring this stuff up to her because it's A) going to cause a fight probably B) If I can't solve things then I'm starting the beginning of the end which I don't want.

Stumbled across it about a week or so ago in my quest for more reading. IT IS FANTASTIC. Bought the book for my Kindle and took endless notes and highlighted. Felt so good about reading it

I am applying principles I've read in the book to better myself and I see such a change. Most notably getting rid of my 'reflected sense of self' (a biggie...if you do nothing else

Sometimes two partners have different viewpoints and feelings about sex, just as having a high sex drive doesn't mean there's something wrong with you! 

One of my biggest pet peeves in this community is our ease at which we are telling people to just leave their partners when they aren't satisfied. Many have expressed that they don't WANT to leave their partners and yet people on here are so quick to say leave. Get out. Run for the hills because YOU aren't satisfied RIGHT NOW. 

Sex for me was so easy with my ex that I was taken aback that it was something that needed work in my current relationship, I did have amazing, effortless, copious sex with my ex, but he's my EX for a reason, and he was a real shitty person when you got down to brass tacks. I happened to find an amazing person 4 years ago that happens to have a little trouble in the sex department. And I've been agonizing a long time about it, and as recently as last weekend threatened to leave because of our DB. Then I found this book.

I, we had sex once every 2 weeks to start, then 1/month then 1/few months then we went about a year without.  We've been married 12 years now.  

3 years ago I decided my life isn't over yet.  I began a emotional affair (that I hoped would turn into a fully physical one) which is still going strong today

Put that on the side burner for now.  With renewed encouragement and confidence I confronted my wife

We went to counseling in order to fix my selfishness and my fits of anger.  (I have always been the most laid back guy you've ever met until these last few years.)  It turns out she was the one being unfair.  She (well

After counseling my wife improved.  We started having sex more often, and then I take care of myself missionary style.  It has always been (even now) as if the only way she would touch my dick is with her vagina.

It makes me crazy when I read about men with women that were abused or are unable to orgasm or have sex related pain.  That really sucks, it would validate the years of hell that I've had.  It's almost like her sudden turn-around is worse.  

All this to say, there are times I hate her.  I use her to fulfill my needs.  I hate who I've become and I blame it all on my patient, kind, thoughtful attitude and the fact that she took advantage of it. 

My affair is with a married woman and neither of us are interested in leaving our spouse/family.  She knows all this about my wife and has been extremely supportive and encouraging.  Finding her saved my marriage.

I'm not really sure where to start. I guess with the fact that my girlfriend and I have been together for over 3 years now and we are absolutely in love. The only problem (I consider it a problem

For about a year or more after the first time we had sex I was initiating more often than not and would always respond positively when she initiated. After a while, but I'd say 4/5 times I turn her down or come up with an excuse or find a way to avoid it. 4/4 times I feel absolutely awful about it.

After thinking about this for a long while I realised that it's not because I've got a diminished sex drive or that I don't find her attractive anymore

What I mean by that is, but it doesn't. For the 2.5 years we've been having sex, she's never once been able to achieve orgasm. I used to blame myself for that (and still partially do) but we have literally spent HOURS on end in the bed, me following her instruction to the letter on what to do and how fast to do it and how long to do it for with absolutely no result. You can only lie on your stomach pleasuring your woman exactly how she says she wants it but barely getting a moan for so long before you don't really want to do it again.

The other thing is that even before she gets me to take control, no feeling that she truly, actually wants me. As I've said before, I'm always touching her and I compliment her every chance I get, but I get none of that in return. She can't even give me a peck on the cheek because ""It doesn't feel like I'm doing it right"". It's really hard to want to have sex when you don't feel sexy at all. It's so bad that I can't even get her to make eye-contact with me during sex. In the off chance we do, she just giggles nervously and quickly looks away. 

All of this makes our sex life seem so procedural

I've tried bringing these things up as subtly and gently as possible several times in the past

My wife (34F) and I (31M) have been married for 4 years, just making-out and having physical contact with each other.  Words were unnecessary.

Once we moved in together, just lying in the bed, giving each other messages and talking.  When we started having sex, it was exciting and frequent (multiple times per week).

Because we weren't teenagers, but it was still a number of times every month.  And, more to what I enjoy, I still got to spend lots of time, just caressing her beautiful skin and feeling the warmth of her body on mine.  Oddly, despite repeated requests for make-out sessions, she refused to kiss me with anything deeper than a parent  might kiss a child (at least

Fast forward to last year (a few years into our marriage); sex has gotten to the point that once a month is stretching it.  I went from Valentines to our Anniversary (in June) w/o any action.  Our evenings plans mostly involve her putting her head in my lap and falling asleep while I watch TV.  She gets remarkably offended if I choose to browse reddit over letting her fall asleep in my lap.  On the rare occasion that work prevents me from being home in our bed from midnight to 6am, she thinks I'm just being ridiculous.

Moving to current conditions, she gave me some story about how she feels queasy when I ""release"" in her, but she feels sore when I use a condom.  When I asked her to have her lady doctor see about treatments that can help, my wife promised that she ask at her next appointment (in December 2013).  When I told her that sex isn't the only intimacy that could help (like a nice make-out session, maybe?), she replies that her falling asleep in my lap is a sign that she trusts me, and I should be happy in knowing that she feels that safe with me.  Whatever.

And then tonight just sent me into insomnia land.  From time to time, she was being very insistent that if I didn't start spooning, she was NOT going to let me sleep.

And that is why tonight I am feeling more hurt than ever.  As I told her, but I need more affection from her in more ways.  She says she loves me and cares about me, but I'm having a real hard time believing that when it doesn't appear that she cares about my needs.

I don't desire anyone else but her.  I don't want divorce.  I don't need sex.  I do need intimacy.  How do I get her to see that I'm just looking to rekindle my connection with her?",,t5_2t25p,1375856095.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1jv8gy/so_now_she_wants_to_cuddle/

At first it was a long distance relationship, so that might have lead to me thinking we had sex often.

That cuddling or lying in bed together doesn't always need to lead to sex. 

I fully agree with that, it doesn't seem to change anything.

If I give up entirely and don't initiate anything

I've mentioned to her that I believe I have a high libido, that I'm just ""normal"". 

She says girls don't go around thinking about having sex like men do. She says she can always be ""convinced"" to have sex
Really? Do women think this way?


Reading this, it sounds sad and desperate.

-I don't want to come off as bragging (trust me) but I'm fairly large (down there) which made sex uncomfortable for her as she healed

Here is a letter I wrote today, you'll notice some overlap. I personally found his book instructive; but your mileage may of course vary.)

Dear Younger/Older Me

So you look back over the past few days, years(?) and things are going through a bit of a dry spell. The first thing to remember is that you can't talk your way through this problem. You don't just want to have sex more, you want her to want to have sex more, right? And you can't talk someone into wanting sex more -- you have to be more attractive, on a few different levels.

Summary:

Be fit

More detail comes in 4 parts:

Set-Up  
1) Long-Term  
2) Short-Term  
  
Actually Do It  
3) During the day  
4) At Night  
  
So here we go.  
  
1) Set Up Long-Term  
These are things that you may not be able to change immediately. Maybe you're already doing a lot of this, you've been slacking, you should fix that; but you don't have to make them perfect before you get laid. It's much more important to just make a plan and take the first step in that plan, and then take another step each day. But the step is significant.

a) fitness. you should be in the best shape of your life.   
  
Imagine you went to go pick up someone at a bar or club. Could you pick up someone as hot as your partner? It's not reasonable for your partner to give you 'bonus points' for being in love with you; whatever 'bonus points' you've accumulated are counterbalanced by the boredom of seeing the same person over and over. 

Also, the fitter your partner will want to be. If you get hotter and hotter, they will feel uncomfortable being the less hot one, and feel positively inspired to become a better version of themselves. So you will feel more confident, they will feel more confident, and you will both be more attracted to each other -- four ways the sex will be better.

Look at what you're eating. Re-commit to an exercise plan. read /r/fitness. Get off the couch and get sexy!
  
b) present yourself well day-to-day  
  
Wear nice clothes
  
  
2) Set-Up Short-Term  
  
a) hygene  
  
sometimes, maybe half and hour or so, and be at your best in the following:

- trim your facial hair
- trim and clean your nails (hands and feet)
- clean up your browline
- clean hairs out of you nose and ears 
- brush and floss your teeth
- take a long
  
b) household  
  
Your partner is not going to feel super sexy if the house is a mess. Solve this problem while giving them a dose of comfort-inducing oxytocin by working the following areas:  
  
- laundry
- dishes
- pick up obvious crap throughout the house
- spend five minutes or less cleaning the bathroom

It's not hard. You shouldn't have to do this stuff in order to earn sex. At the same time, feel free to do a little extra to make up for it. It's just sharing the load like Samwise.  
  
  
3) Actually Do It - During the day  
  
If this was someone you had just met, you need to keep doing this, maybe not every single day, but frequently, in order to prevent a backslide into 'just-friends-town'.

During a day in which you'd like to have sex
    
a) flirt - in person  
  
Kiss more. She's not going to say no to a quick peck turning into a series of sexy pecks turning into a nice long deep kiss. A real kiss

Also

Another thing, but tell her exactly what you're going to do and when. This works.

b) flirt - via text  
  
If this was a new lover/she was having an affair, just be the person she's texting with.

More homey 'how is your day going?' texts are beta -- this is a *good* thing, or just imply that you've been thinking dirty thoughts. Tell them about a fantasy (feel free to say, ""I had a little dream about you..."").   



4) Actually Do It - At Night  
  
This means you've put in some changes

Remember that she likes sex. Just because you didn't spontaneously stand up and announce ""I LOVE PIZZA"" while reading the previous paragraph, stupid -- the point is that she really likes sex. She loves sex! She just says, ""I just don't think of it.""

Well hopefully in step 3 you made her think of it. But now its time to seal the deal.

a) be alpha (as fuck!)  
  
Being beta is a good thing. It makes her feel safe and stable. (did you do the dishes yet?) But being alpha is where you get laid. 

A good model is two guys (a guy and a girl, the guy in charge decides to go left or right. Maybe if they had a debate, they would each take a side and talk it out. But in this case, its more important to just make a decision and get to the next room. If they have a formal hearing about every door, they are going to get shot. 

In other words, hamburger or mexican. She makes decisions all day. She doesn't care what we're having for dinner, probably. Give her the gift of not having to make yet another decision for someone. Give her a 10-second vacation from being assertive. It's sexy.

It's good to playfully tease her verbally. It's good to decide what and where to eat. You aren't being a tyrant

To take it to the next level, but also matter-of-fact. This will work, be bold.

b) Initiate       
  
If you want a pizza, ""that's a long wait for a train never comes."" But if the pizza guy really wanted your business, he'd call *you* and offer a pie, right?

I know I'm mixing pizza metaphors, you are primed and ready. She expects its coming. You don't have to do a rain dance. But you do have to do *something*.

Here are two options that will work:

Kiss her. kiss her again. Kiss her a third time, but end on a real, lingering kiss. Then, on a scale from alpha to alpha-as-fuck, say: ""You want to head to the bedroom?"" ""We should head to the bedroom"" ""Bedtime."" or just point at the bedroom. If it's 10:00 or so, ""Bedtime"" is the magic word that will get you laid.

Did plenty of groundwork already? Been flirting all night? Skip directly to the magic word. The episode comes to an end. Which of the following great things sounds even better than the other: One more episode of Fraiser? Receiving a blowjob or kinky sex?
  
Say this word: ""Bedtime!""  
  
It's 9:45. She gets it.  
  
That is ALL YOU HAVE TO DO.

So I see one doctor

Then yesterday I went for a talk with my GP as I had to get more birth control (no idea why im still taking the bloody pill as I no longer need them) and she suggests a ten min gyno exam. While doing so she asks ""does it hurts when you have sex?"" and I start crying.. a ten minute appointment turns into me sitting there for half an hour and my GP telling me I have something called cervical ectopy that can be caused by the pill and is most likely the reason for the pain Im getting during sex. 

Now this doesnt explain my LL

How wrong was I.. He isnt happy at all.. oh no

I get it

I love him, but when it comes to the pain I havnt actually made that up and now that I know what was causing it there is a way to make it go away? And how can I make him understand that these little remarks he keeps coming with is making it even worse for me to do anything with him when my LL is making it hard enough in the first place?

So I've had a bit of a read around this subreddit and most of these posts seem to be about people who are the 'victims' of DB and the majority of the advice here is ""get the fuck out of the relationship"". Fair enough. I probably wouldn't even argue with most of those comments. 

However

**I have tried to bold the main points to help you guys read through this.**

Some general points. I am female

When I first started going out with my bf, me not being too comfortable with initiating physical contact and sex was very painful. 

A side note, to the point of slowly falling asleep in eachother's arms (even though I had to go home each night). It was just easy. I wasn't too affectionate in public, but our sexual life was quite ok to be honest. The reason we broke up was because of us just going separate ways and not being very compatible. Sexually, we were compatible however.

Anyway

- First 6-12 months we were very happy with eachother. However
- **He couldn't get it up the first time we tried to have sex with a condom. He couldn't get hard when I touched him. He couldn't stay hard even if he did get hard at first. He couldn't get hard even if I tried to give him a BJ. My self-esteem absolutely plummeted. Very quickly. **
- We tried things here and there
- I had problems initiating physical contact before. but now this issue grew enormously. I did not want to reach out and touch him
- after a huge fight, and even elaborated on which physical ""defects"" he didn't like. 

This went on for a while... 4 years later

**But

He decided he's going to let me initiate ""when i want it"". This made things worse because I was already having trouble initiating and I felt like none of these issues got resolved.

Now I'm at a point where I don't want to get into bed. Once I get into bed

I have tried to tell him. **He has tried to not pressure me**. But I know what he is thinking. And I have no self esteem left. **I wake up in the morning angry and irritated because I feel guilty and incapable. I go to sleep annoyed

**I am constantly feeling guilty, because I see these symptoms from him even now if I try anything. I give up too quickly. I know. But I wasn't the type of person that could handle so much negative feedback. 

and now i'm stuck. and** I can't convey these issues to him because he tells me that things have changed now and that I should let go of the past. But he cannot understand that this past has shaped a lot of my habitual reactions to him now. **

I've realised this is a massive rant

looking forward to your responses. Good luck reading this post.

tl;dr my bf's sexual issues and negative feedback have led to my incredibly low self esteem and motivation to do anything in bed. 

just read the bold bits.

I need passion. I need to be needed the way I need her.

... meanwhile knowing the woman I devote my life to barely sees me as a sexual creature at all. It hurts.

Why am I so fucking jealous? I can't help it. I try to help it. I am doing everything I can. I can't open all the doors. I can't make her love me. I can't make her be in love with me. I can't hold hands and stroke hair and hug forever. **I need more than this**

... in some sense

We give up the hope of having some of that stuff when we get married ... I understand that. But I don't think we have to surrender as much as it feels like I've had to for this.

It may or may not improve things but since I have a significant amount of money involved(basically I can buy a decent house outright) it is not a chance I am willing to take.

However where I feel bad is that I feel like I have just wasted her time.  She wants kids before 30 and well I don't think that is possible without me. I honestly feel like me leaving will destroy her and I feel absolutely terrible for doing it.

I was after some advice

I guess I could stay at my dad's for awhile

We have had sex more times in the past few weeks then we had in the past year. As a result we're both a lot happier. I know its still early days
It really did come down to communication. I've always been shy in bed until we 'get going' and he always initiated. He stopped initiating due to gaining a few kg due to stress at work. I assumed he didnt want it anymore so I never pushed for it
So after far too long we had a chat, if his extra weight I'd help him get back into shape. He thought I didnt love him anymore because I never pursued sex. That was the wake up call. I decided then and there to lose some inhibition or I could possibly lose him. So I've been acting out all the things ive wanted to do, but held back. 
Well.. it's been pretty mind blowing. We promised each other to never get back to where we were. Just be honest and talk it out. It is hard for me. Ive always held back and felt the words I wanted to say on the tip of my tongue

One week ago I tried to initate some intimacy/sexy time with my wife after a TV show we watch together had ended as we were sitting on the couch snuggling and watching TV wile she was wearing a sexy camisole/thong set that I had asked her to put on earlier in the evening. She rebuffed my advance (kissing her neck softly and asking her if she would like to go to the bedroom) by telling me that she would be happy ""never having sex again"" (her exact words). I was devestated


She has since cut off any sexual activities and gets openly hostile when I try to initiate. This is the culmination of a slow decline in intimacy in our marriage over the past few years. I am 33 she is 34 We have 3 children together all under 4years old and she is at home on a maternity leave while I work full time Mon-Fri. When we were dating she was full of passion and put effort into making love. She is multi orgasmic and would normally have 5-10 orgasms every time we had sex. I have never had any erectile or performance issues.


When we were making babies we were having sex twice a day until she discoved that she was pregnant


I assist with housework and child rearing a considerable amout (much more than many other husbands I know) but I could be doing more in this regard (ie waiting on them hand and foot and taking no time for myself).


In the last month she has starting spending all of her free time playing facebook games and watching television shows to the exclusion of anything else. She has a passion for playing a particular sport and will be starting this month one night a week playing it on a local recreational team.


I do not suspect her of cheating on me and have never cheated or could cheat on her. I was cheated on once by a past girlfriend and know how devestating it feels. She in not on birth control and has not been on the pill for years. Birth control has been managed surgically since the birth of our last baby. I have asked her to attend marriage counceling with me and she has agreed


I do not understand why she has chosen to deny me the love and closeness that I need from sexual intimacy with her.


AMA or provide advice please. This situation has made me terribly depressed and I am willing to do anything and put in enormous effort to resuming a healthy relationship with her.

1332626990.0,rbwpc,My Dead Bedroom Story,ComDotBoom,22,3,29,"I am glad I found this subreddit. Talking about the fact that my marriage has only seen sex a handful of times in the last few years is difficult and there's a certain humiliation factor that prevents me from bringing this topic up with my friends.

I have been married for 5 years

Let me preface this by saying that I am not an unattractive person at all. There is room for improvement

I feel stuck between a rock and hard place in this situation because I love my husband very much. I don't want an open marriage

I ask for sex often and am rejected 99% of the time. He gets agitated if I ask too frequently, half because I'm glad he's getting some sexual release when he needs it and half because it gives me some sign that his libido isn't completely dead.

I am good to him. I do my best to take care of him and do my best to try and create ""sparks"" in our marriage by going on dates and stuff. I bought some massage oil the other day so that I could give him a massage or two

On the rare occasion I will get him to agree to have sex on a future day (i.e. in a few days). This actually ends up being more painful for me than an outright rejection because in the day leading up to our planned sex, I'm not feeling that great today."" or, ""Oh boy, am I ever tired."" and I know when he starts rolling out those statements that we won't be having sex that night. On some sex date occasions he'll mention his tiredness so often I'll tell him, ""Ok, I get it. We're not having sex!"" ... which is kind of funny, if only it weren't so sad. It's almost as if when my sex drive is high he is living in a constant state of fear that I will be asking for sex and he knows that he cannot or does not want to engage in it with me.

It definitely comes and goes in cycles. Some weeks my sex drive is kind of low, my sex drive is insane. I feel like I could have sex 24x7. This is obviously when it is hardest for me to deal with and when the rejection hurts my self esteem the most. I almost wish I didn't have a sex drive so that we were both on the same page in not wanting it.

Outside of the fact that we have a dead bedroom, spend most of our time together when we aren't working, and have a lot in common. I guess that's the thing. Since we otherwise get along and make each other happy, not having sex is not enough of a reason for me to leave the marriage.

I am going to keep on figuring out ways to create that ""spark"" that I am looking for in our marriage:

- I'm working on keeping myself healthy and attractive.

- I'm supporting him in his efforts to be healthy and attractive. I know that he often feels like a bit of a ""slob"", but we're married so you're supposed to say that."" and I usually reply with, ""Maybe, but the fact that I want to have sex with you every day is probably proof enough that I think you're hot""

- I'm trying to communicate to him that I am open to ""anything"". Maybe this guy wants something in the bedroom and just can't bring himself to ask me.

- We don't watch porn together but I think it's something that I'm going to encourage. I'm not totally confident that he'll want to do that

And if none of that works...

I guess I'll have little choice but to settle for the sexless marriage thing. Like I said

That said, it kind of makes her seem more like a sexual servant than a partner. She doesn't get that much enjoyment from sex. I've asked her and asked her what I can do to make it more pleasurable. She said it's not my fault, she just isn't that into sex. She never initiates.

We have sex a couple of nights a week (I've told her that anything less than this is a big problem for me). Every time it's the same thing: she comes out of the shower, and I mean NEVER, any initiative taken. There's never any spontaneity, either. If I do something that might turn her on outside of the bedroom, she tells me to stop, because she doesn't want to get turned on. Even if the kids are already in bed, she won't let anything happen outside the planned time, or in the garage

We've argued about this so much, not a servant. Do I have a right to expect her to take initiative with sex? I am VERY unhappy, and just don't know what else to do.

For the last several months, we discussed separating. The big turning point came when we realized that we both felt a sense of relief at the idea, not despair. We decided to separate but not to make any rash decisions, just let it sink in for a few days to make sure it was the right decision. 

That's where it got weird. We started having conversations about how we'd work out our post-marriage lives, finances, etc. The conversations became calm, supportive, and rational. This went on for a few days and all of a sudden a little tenderness crept back in. Then I kissed her one day and it felt like a first kiss. That night I held her and it led to more. 

Then, has two kids, a low sex drive, and is incredibly picky about who she'll date. While my prospects are pretty good (lots of single moms in the area and I like kids), hers are not so great. She decided that her chances of finding anyone are kind of low, her finding anyone she’d be okay with are very low, and her chances of finding anyone as good as me are almost nonexistent. 

On top of this, we did it three times.

Ok, the youngest is only 8 months old. I'm breastfeeding him and he's very, very attached to me.



We have pretty infrequent sex due to my being very wrapped up with the baby and kids and he falls asleep very early (by 8:30) because he works in the hot sun all day at a pretty physical job. The kids are still up by the time he's fast asleep. I would like more sex, cuddling, or focus on me for a while, just wham bam thank ya ma'am (which is mostly OK with me, I like it fast and hard too) but we never have time to ""make love"". The last time we did, his mother came over to watch the kids and we went to her house and had awesome sex/lovemaking in his old bed. It was amazing and I personally want more of that kind of sex...although I know its rare. That was about a month ago, and that was the last time he got a BJ.


So now just a few minutes ago I was texting with him and I mentioned how we havent had sex in 5 days and how he must be ready to burst. He says
Idk why but this pissed me off. Not, making love"" just pretty much, ""woman its time to service your man!""


Do men ever consider that unlike the bullshit world of porn, it turns us on and then ""pop"" the man is done and the woman is left hanging. Now, if I knew he'd reciprocate I'd be more willing to do it. I have too much shit to do to deal with added sexual frustration. If BJs were totally normal and natural to give and receive than I could cum with my mouth and dicks would taste like chocolate! Personally, I think he's looking at porn and wants what he's seeing in porn. He even got pissed and said, ""I guess this is married life! No blowjobs!""

Update: So we spoke on the phone about all of this and I told her that I'm having a lot of difficulty waiting until marriage (which we've forecasted at 2-3 years from now = 8 years of no sex ... just typing that out made me uncomfortable). I told her that it makes me feel rejected

I then explained to her that it's not just the idea of mechanical penetration
I then tried to explain how this rejection feels
just the idea of penetration
and her lack of initiative. She admits that I've complained about her initiative before

I then asked her why was she trying to put me inside her, and she thought I would get pleasure from that. This bothered me because I never asked for this, and I've only told her that I'm worried about her doing that  and that she shouldn't be doing that if it's hurting her. In fact I asked her what was she expecting out of it, and how would she have reacted if suddenly one day I was able to go in all the way. I told her that I really misinterpreted this as that she wanted to start trying to have sex, and I honestly feel led on. She apologized for that.

I then asked her about why she always pushes me away when I try to go down/finger her. She said she likes the idea of me cumming first because she feels like when she cums her body gets too sensitive and she gets ticklish if I touch her

I then explained to her she always pushes me away when I try to bring her to orgasm after I cum, I almost felt like I was going crazy. I asked her if she wants to wait until marriage, even though I felt rejected and etc. And she said she still wants to wait and that a lot of women wait, and a lot of women do what she's doing (Honestly, I don't know any of these women and I wish she would introduce me to them). I tell her I'm scared that marriage won't change any of this, and she says it can, and there's no reason why it can't. I'm honest and tell her I'm not sure how.  She then says she is making this choice and she can't compare her choice to my feelings of rejection because she can only try to understand what I'm feeling. I don't know how I felt about hearing this. 

At this point I was getting frustrated to the point of being upset
I just asked her why wasn't she saying any of these things to me
before, and all she was told was from catholic school, ""only speak about sex when you're married"". I told her I was really bothered that she never even told me that either. She's told me about her choice to be a virgin in the past, but not something like that. I told her that I want her to talk to me about these things and I couldn't understand why in five years she never brought anything up. I told her this is really hard for me, and that it's harder that I can't talk to people and have to reach out to the anonymous internet. She then got upset and said that she feels like she's always messing things up and that it's because she just doesn't open up, and she never knows how to, and that she wishes she could understand how to talk better. Leading to she feels like she is incapable of being in a relationship because she always thinks things are going amazing and then out of nowhere things go bad and it always ends up being about her communication. At this point I just felt like shit. I didn't say it but I just felt like I was being selfish

Today, just asked ""are you going to break up with me"" jokingly, and I said ""no"" but she didn't go further into anything to do with last night. Called her back later this evening, asked her a few times if she was okay, and if she wanted to talk, no and no. I texted her and again asked if she wanted to talk about last night, and she said ""not today"". And so I asked if that meant that she wanted to talk about it later, and asked was there any reason why we shouldn't talk about it, selfish, instead of having to ask. She started again with saying she just keeps upsetting me. I'm to tired

Overall there's a voice in the back of my head telling me that we have extremely different definitions of sex. Mine is expression and physical validation, and she can be completely honest. And she just said she has communication problems and she still wants to stick by her choice. I feel like I shouldn't have gotten upset at her trying to push me inside her, and I wish I could've just been appreciative that she just thought it would give me pleasure, maybe I'm just being selfish, I don't know. She knows I have a high libido, she knows that last year I went on medication that increased my libido. I'm tired of masturbating to porn. I'm tired that people say I should get a hooker or go to a strip club. I'm tired that I can't even talk to my guy friends about this kind of stuff. These are battles I don't need. I'm so tired.

I feel ugly because I feel like if I was more appealing as a partner
she'd be willing to take a risk on me after these five long years.

1371578600.0,1gljye,[32/M] Marriage to a [32/F] and Forced Celibacy,monkeysmademedoit,24,8,34,"Greetings!

I'm a 32/M married to a 32/F. We've been married for about 5 years and we dated for about a year prior. She and I met on online.

My wife is pretty dang cool. She's funny, and is my best friend. I love her, truly. We're expecting our first child soon, too.

I imagine at this point you're sensing a ""but"" coming up, is sex. Actually, it's the lack of it.

After we got married and before she got pregnant

If we do have sex, and I feel bad about it. It's all about getting it done ASAP. I feel like the girl in the relationship when I'm trying to get her to cuddle for a while first.

She says she enjoys it (and she seems to) but has also said it's just not something she wants to do. I've asked for BJs (emphatic NO). I've asked for HJs (""Ugh

I tried all kinds of things to ramp up our sex lives:

*     cleaning and doing housework
*     buying her gifts (I do enjoy that)
*     being romantic
*     talking about it
*     not bothering her about it (at this point I haven't ""put the moves"" on my wife in several years because I'd be shut down 100% of the time)
*     reading self-help books on the subject
*     telling her I love her more
*     telling her I love her less
*     asking about toys/fetishes/fantasies
*     humor
*     telling her she's beautiful (every day

The list goes on. I understand that women go through changes when they get pregnant, (b) I was on the fence about having a kid. I'm glad we are, but part of me regrets it. I honestly didn't think we had sex often enough for her to get pregnant, but it does only take one time. Plus, I had the ultimatum of baby or else (or else she'd leave). I was at least looking forward to a long period of trying to get her pregnant... No such luck.

It's starting to affect me more than I thought possible. It's all I can think about and it stresses me out beyond belief. I'm turning into a huge grump and I don't like it. It's making me short with her and my friends. It's making me more than a little crazy

I don't want to cheat on her. Honestly, but I cancelled it. Part of me feels like, if you're going to close the store for good, don't be surprised when people start to shop elsewhere. I realize that's probably the wrong attitude.

I'm not a perfect man by any stretch of the imagination

I've even done some research into drugs that suppress the male libido. I mean

So

TL;DR: My wife never wants to have sex with me.

As I look at the calendar and see our 13th anniversary approaching this weekend, but I'm starting to think a full Talk with an ultimatum or trial separation is the next step. 

Incoming wall o' text

My wife has degenerative disk disease in three disks in her lower back

The injury that precipitated all this occurred years before we even met. It was mild, intense, creative, adventurous, physically and emotionally satisfying for us both. 

She had a second injury about a year after our daughter was born. We had no health insurance at the time of the injury

Eventually, but after those failed to even touch the pain an x-ray and MRI showed the extent of the damage. She graduated to opiate painkillers, and has since been on a slow upward climb as her opiate tolerance builds. 

Every new scan shows worsening of her condition. She refuses to try a surgical repair because of an anesthesia scare during a hernia operation a few months after our daughter was born. Every few months, her libido has been destroyed - although as I think on it, it had started suffering before the opiates, during a time when we didn't have a place of our own and had to couch surf with a friend. We went most of a year celibate then, due to no real opportunity or privacy being available to us. 

On rare occasions, it died off again. We've had sex twice since February 1st. 

So that's my situation. Here's the killer: I'm faced with an effectively sexless marriage for the rest of my life. I have no good options. My wife is the love of my life - I don't want just sex, every time she has a flash of libido at an inopportune time (and I know that by the time we can act on it she will have lost the urge), every time I try to initiate and get rejected. Or I can leave, breaking up an otherwise happy family, possibly losing my daughter, being seen as ""the bad guy"" for bailing on my disabled wife because of what many will see as a selfish reason, and knowing that my leaving would cause the woman I love to suffer just so I can get laid.

All this time, it never happened. I have to say that we still had a great time together outside of the bedroom...

This is where it gets complicated. I haven't been able, it gets awkward, anxiety sets in, and I refrain from doing so. This awkwardness snowballed up to this weekend, when she brought it up again. 

Anyhow, but she refused to tell me what they were). Divorce is definitely one of her option (not that it matters, but she is a divorce lawyer).  One thing is for sure, sex is off the table for now, and I was told that there's nothing I could do to make things better at this point.

I mentioned my reasons why things went down like they did over the past few years

After much soul searching these past few days, being the dominant person in this relationship, is unknowingly(?) using me as a doormat and it decreases her attraction towards me.

-After having sex the first time

My marriage is a mess.

The reason I haven't been able to face leaving him is because I have allowed myself to be such a mess in the meantime. I can't even think about whether this marriage is salvageable or not until I fix myself. I have actually been terrified that if I was desirable to other men I would stray

Things I Want from Life &amp; from Marriage:

1) I want to be attractive again. I want to look in the mirror and know that if he isn't going to want me

2) I want to be valued. I have never been valued in this marriage. From day one he has treated me with complete disrespect

3) I want to be able to make simple choices without it becoming a life-or-death issue. I should be able to go out with friends without getting passive-aggressive sighs &amp; comments and abuse. I should be able to decide I want a dog (he has his big dog that he has completely relinquished all care of!). I should have equal access to our money without being berated for it.

4) I want self-respect again. I've given it all away.

Simply put? I've let him mash me down into a part of a person that I don't even like. I'm scared, I will never be able to choose a relationship for myself where I get what I want.

I say anything, I've given her time, space, I've been gentle and never gotten annoyed with her at failed attempts (I mean this - I haven't just hidden it, I haven't been angry at all). I've told her to try whatever she can - although I've told her I'd prefer something better than a handjob because I can do that myself. It's becoming less and less frequent, as though she's not trying. We've tried lube, we've tried rules to make it easier (eg. both agreeing we won't try penetration even if we both want it). I've even suggested mutual masturbation would be enough to get comfortable with each other again. The only time I get angry is if she's trying something and obviously looks annoyed.  

She says she doesn't like sex, and she can't help it. She says everything leading up to it is the same; without arousal she doesn't want it. I asked her to try building up to the point where she remembers how much she used to enjoy it. I make sure she has an orgasm every time (even if she has to help out).  

We've only ever been with each other, and I believe her reasons.

I met my wife in 2005 we became friends very fast and connected very well. We was friends for a year until I stuck myself out and we started dating, sex was great 3/4 times a week.

So what went wrong? Well in 2008 my wife was on her way to work and way trying to open our garage door and it was frozen shut. She pulled hard and threw her back out. In a ton of pain she came back in called me at work and told me what happened, they gave her some meds and told her to go to her family doctor. We did. X-Rays MRI she damaged 3 discs, and calcium had formed in them. We was told her would have to work her back and help build it back to where it was. We tried and tried. Sexual intercourse now hurt her in ways she couldn't handle, which I could totally see the change in her and how it made her. 

2 years after that winter 2010 our bedroom is almost dead it's hard to have a sex life when no matter what position it's done in. We pleased each other in other ways which I was totally fine with. That winter was hard my wife couldn't get off the chair she couldn't move felt like her arms and legs Back to doctors

Over the last two years she's in pain 24/7 sleep is scarce and she up 5 to six times a night. I have moved out of the bedroom and got my own room so i could get a good night sleep. Which in it's self made sexual stuff down to almost never. The beginning of 2012 in January, she's my best friend, and it's not like she is choosing to not do anything she simply can't. We found out she has a couple different things which have all come together to make a shit storm. I love her so much I wish i could take the pain away, my bed is dead but not by choice of me/my wife or just growing apart. complex medical problems have made things stop. We don't snuggle/ touch/ kiss sleep in the same bed. It saddens me to see people on here some have kids and i can see why they want to keep things together, but those that are on here because they don't find there partner sexually stimulating or other things. I see them and think you can move on and find someone more compatible with you. I do not see any change for my dead-bed, I love my wife and hope someday she will be better.

Reason I have been reading through these posts, although it is a very bad (painful) position for everyone here to be in a relationship such as these, I want to remind everyone that it is JUST as painful (if not more) as well to be on the other side.

You can call me the reason for a DB. Yes. It's me. I rarely have sex with my ""S.O."" and he/she comes to this subreddit

I am assuming that most people understand the pain is on BOTH sides of this, PLEASE, don't (for a minute) think that it isn't painful for the other half.

My average day is:

1 - Watching my ""S.O."" walk around and attempt to function from day to day, knowing how deep the pain goes for him/her due to the fact that there is something in our relationship that i can't provide. Something that is ALWAYS missing. It crushes me so deep down inside, that, I wish the roles were reversed.

2 - Every so often, this is as if it is being kicked in harder. I know I am not being reminded for any hateful or devious reasons, but, just to be reminded of it at all brings the pain to an all new level. It sometimes feels that i am being reminded of a problem that i have. For example , if I was in a wheelchair. To have your ""S.O."" remind you every couple of months that he/she is sad because you are wheelchair bound. 

3 - There ARE times I feel ""in the mood"" (if you will), I feel that if I do engage in any ""activity"", that he/she may think I am reacting to NOT being active. In other words, just trying to make him/her happy.

4 - Last, I just don't get the urge for sex very often. So, what am i to do? Engage in activities if I really am not in the mood? Many years ago we made that promise to each other that we will NOT fake this. I feel it would be a lie to have sex with him/her if the mood isn't there.

I also want to make it clear, or, saying that certain parties are right/wrong. 

This post is to make it clear that this pain is on BOTH sides of the relationship. not just one.

Perhaps there are people that will disagree with the points I made. That's fine. I just needed to get my feelings out there.",,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/z8foa/a_message_from_the_other_side/

So I've never posted, and excited to have adventures together. However my dissatisfaction began to bubble up not long after the honeymoon period was over. He started basically living at my apartment, and soon after I complained to him that our time together was getting boring; that we weren't spending *quality* time together but merely cohabitating. He was very resistant to this and frankly quite miffed at my complaint. Over time I got used to the new norm. When we moved in together legit-style, cleanliness quickly became an issue. Cleaning is not something he deems necessary. He does do dishes and laundry, but everything else he needs to be asked to do. I do the lion's share of work, in my opinion. And I can't even clean up his things for him because he gets mad when he can't find something. 

But probably the hardest thing for me was that our sex-life was starting to slide. It didn't happen over night, to once a month. And now I consider myself blessed if I've gone through a cycle and had sex once. I would proposition him occasionally, and as I was rejected with more frequency it would sting more and more. 

I've of course talked to him about this

 None of these conversations helped

Around 6 months ago I suddenly realized just how little affection he'd been showing for me. Very rarely would he hug me or kiss me. I'd be the one to initiate these things. He would only say he loved me if I said it first. He's also vehemently unromantic. I used to really enjoy romance with my previous boyfriends; I'd make cheesy hand-made cards, which really bummed me out so I told him I didn't want flowers or any of that stuff, but I simply wanted him to not be *mean* to me on Valentine's Day. Well this incensed him and he totally went off on me for reasons that I still can't understand and left me sobbing alone in our bedroom. On fucking Valentine's Day.

So now we have the present. I feel under-appreciated, but can you blame me? I'm frustrated, and locking up my frustration doesn't work. I also don't think that having very basic needs is ""needy"". I've given him plenty of space. But what I have right now isn't anything close to how I think a relationship should be.

I've stuck through it for quite some time feeling unsatisfied. I did this because in a so many ways we are very compatible. We've had a lot of fun and adventures together

tldr; very little sex, doesn't give a shit. Is there any hope?

The relationship is very loving. Our bedtime routine for the last two years is him reading to me for about 1/2 an hour, and really, I shouldn't complain. But I am.

Today I threw away an empty BC packet. It's the second one. We've been two months without sex, it's been a very cursory ""quickie"", either that he's initiated right before we have to go out, or after I've basically straight-up asked him to fuck me. It's all been missionary, too - though we used to try new positions and things all the time.

This last week I did a ""steak and BJ"" night

The part that's my fault... The last time I basically begged and got a 10 min quickie, exactly, ""Um... Can we be romantic sometimes too?"" - he felt really badly and apologized a lot, kind of to the point of carrying on *too much* and... that was the end of it.

Shortly after we first got together, where the pills ran out (for the week off) and realized we hadn't had sex for the entire month (well, I realized, I'm sure he was hyperaware of it). Even if he only brought it up once a week, I felt pressured. But the empty BC packet was a wake-up call, I got myself to the dr and switched prescriptions, and everything was fine for a few years.

Now it seems like a role reversal. He's still very loving, but the conversation either becomes a(n unsatisfying) quickie - what feels so much like a pity fuck to me - or he gets really upset and I have to spend the next two hours telling him I *do* love him, and it's just a sex thing, not a loving-in-general thing.

Other stuff that may be relevant:
* This last year I finished my undergrad and will start my Masters in sept. My MSc program comes with funding

* He works from home

* I have pretty awful body issues. I feel fat, despite actually having lost weight and gotten in better shape in the last year. I know it's in my head, but it's hard not to say he's lying when he tells me I'm beautiful. Maybe I finally convinced him.

* We adopted a cat three months ago.

Even if we never had sex again, so maybe I should imagine this is the same thing.

When I found out she got the advice to break up with me from the internet I was pretty upset. She promised everything would be great and that she was only hooking up with this guy as a part of her sexual health. It was really hard for me to agree to this

Prior to this she said even being attracted to other people or putting yourself in situations where you are attracted to other people is cheating. I went ahead and followed these constraints close and she even went as far to say if I hooked up with a random girl that wasn't my friend then it wouldn't be the same so I wasn't allowed to do that.

Right after she had sex with this guy the whole tone changed. It was the first time I had seen her in a week and she wouldn't look at me or kiss me or touch me. I found out she had hooked up with this guy because she had hickies on her neck. Then later I went to face book to tell the guy off because I was really upset and she wouldn't take the time to talk to me about it. Then she yelled at me and told me that I was being a dramatic about this whole situation and went on to call me a fucking idiot for three days solid.

It makes me feel like I have wasted 3 years of my life to get treated like this. I have only been there to support her all this time and now I feel like I am being thrown away. Every once in a while she talks about our future and how it will all be great after she gets single time in and then other days I am not even allowed to hold her hand.

She said we are broken up now and that I can go out with other people

I am currently looking for a job and it is difficult. I am in a new place and all the people I hang out are from reddit. I want to get a job soon so I can move out but I have a hard time getting employers to talk to me.

I'm just spiraling into bitterness, emotions, and needs. Every time I bring something up, I end up feeling worse than I did before. I've been distant and bitter, and I'm having a hard time controlling it, because our dead bed and everything that I feel because of it is always on my mind. I know that I need to not be so bitter in order to have any progress, but every time that she refuses to view things from my emotional point of view, and so I give myself some space. Besides

This is a letter I wrote and read to her last night

&gt;My choices are between setting myself up for disappointment or resigning myself to disappointment. To me, but a necessity. It brings me close to you and makes me feel like I have a real partner. It changes how I view the world and makes me feel like I can do anything, and we are unstoppable. 

&gt;Without sex in our relationship, all the while we suffer? How can you be so unsympathetic to my feelings? What it says about how you think of me and us is what upsets me the most and makes me feel the most alone. 

&gt;With that as context, and it should not be terribly surprising that I may be a little bitter.  

&gt;I need sex out of a relationship. That's the reason to be in a relationship instead of just friends or roommates to begin with. When I want things to get better and you are indifferent, like today, I feel like you are validating my sense that you don't give a fuck about how I feel. 

&gt;I would think that you would thank me for sticking with you through this extended period of abstinence. Show appreciation

&gt;You want me to shut up, are framed by the effects of our celibacy. It doesn't go away, because again, back to the beginning, my choices are between setting myself up for disappointment or resigning myself to disappointment. 

&gt;At the very minimum

She also does not like when I use various opiates, I am productive, happy, and care a whole lot less that I'm celibate. I never have had a physical addiction to dope, and in general think that it has served as a very effective anti-depressant. But whatever, I can't blame her for wanting me to not fall off the deep end with that. However, with that coping mechanism removed from my bag of tricks, but that is neither here nor there. 

My mental health can't maintain this situation. I just feel broken down. I'm torn between making a real effort to just swallow my pride yet again and sublimate my feelings, but I know from when we have had sex in some form or other on rare occasions over the last few years, that it changes everything for the better. It's like when the color comes on in the Wizard of Oz. At the same time, I also have a healthy fear of her, because just like I've grown accustomed to rejection, I've become accustomed to frightening acts of anger when she is crossed.

Backstory: For the last few years, we never fight.

This might be long.  To begin, but I made sure to be the rock for our family.

My wife started gaining weight after that

After two years of very little sex, or to go to bed early, or to stay with the kids in their room when they woke in the middle of the night as ‘they needed her’.  I talked to her about that not being good for the kids or our marriage but it fell on deaf ears.

Then I just quit coming to bed, we keep our kids busy and she really is a great mom.

Anyway

In the last month

Her suitcase hasn’t even been unpacked yet since her first trip in April and my curiosity got the best of me and I looked through it yesterday.  I was surprised to find lingerie
 
In her top drawer at the bottom I found some American cash she had stashed away.  This  was surprising too has we have never hid money from each other as far as I knew.  I counted the money, but I wrote the number down and put the piece of paper back in her drawer.

I Skyped the number so it would show up as ‘unknown number’

Now things start to fall into place, and she got up, went to the washroom for a bit and then went to sleep in the kids room with her phone.

So last night I tried to make excuses to see her phone at the kids baseball practice.  I knew she had it with her, but I went though her text history quickly when she wasn’t around and it was blank – nothing there.  This is a person that usually had 500 emails and texts saved on her phone because she doesn’t clear her inboxes.  I sent a text to the number just asking if he was there and didn’t get a response back.

When I came back upstairs.   She asked me if something was wrong.  I told her I was upset about her going away again to Michigan.  I wasn’t ready to tip my hand about what I knew yet.

I asked her if everything was okay with us.  Ironically

 I think she beginning to suspects that I may be on to her. So, I took that number our of her drawer again and wrote ‘I know about this and I love you’ on it. 

Really, hidden money and trips out of town don’t prove anything, but things certainly don’t look good for her.  I don’t know if she’s already cheated on me, or if she’s about to cheat on me and there’s still time to stop this.

My goal is to stay calm, people tell me all the time what a great couple we are.  She always been a great mother, and this is totally out of character for her.

I don’t know if I just need to vent

Here are the facts.

* We celebrated our 20^th anniversary last summer. She's 50

* We both currently work at the same company in different divisions; our work sometimes overlaps

* Although she's fit

* Because of her diseases

* Apart from a friendly hug here or there, I would guess.

* A little over a year ago I decided to try to change my life by going back to weightlifting and commuting to work by bike. I've since lost nearly 60 pounds (I'm 6'5""; while I'm down to 285lbs, although she tells me she's very proud of all the changes I've made.

* Over the past year, and I don't want to hurt her. I'm sure she loves me, too. Whatever spark I may have had for her feels finally and utterly extinguished.

* Also over the past year, for the caress of another person who wants me as much as I want them and who wants to touch me, body and soul, as much as I want to touch them.

Okay

While out of town several weeks ago I visited a friend--a young woman (25yrs old) for whom I've long felt great fondness. I was her mentor for several years and we worked on a number of projects together. I drove to her house, a caress led to a kiss, and the kiss led to a night of the most fulfilling, deeply moving sex I've ever had in my life. Maybe it was because it had been so long for me, or maybe I've just never had a lover who was so compassionate and giving, while being so lost in passion herself. I abandoned myself to her completely, and she to me.

We've since chatted online, showing me what was possible in life.

Sunday I told my wife I couldn't live like this anymore. It was the hardest conversation of my life. She wants to seek medical care for her sex-drive and marital therapy to help resurrect our marriage. She told me she thought we were doing fine these past years

I welcome your thoughts, should I go and maybe end up alone--or maybe, just maybe, find that human touch I seem to need so desperately?

**TL;DR** Wife and I of 20 years have not been intimate in the last 3 years; I don't seem to have any feelings left for her

**Update:** I very much appreciate all your thoughtful contributions, many times. We've always been able to talk--we've at least had that much going for us. Sometimes we would attempt a kind of awkward, begrudging intimacy. Other times she would become angry at my attempts to tell her how lonely I was for her. Clearly, my attempts were inept. Yet I think in situations like this it's much easier for the one who doesn't want to be close (or, to put it in better terms, doesn't feel the need to be closely connected in those ways) to win the day, so to speak. Let me also say that I don't resent my wife or blame her. I think she's terrific. But I'm terrified on two fronts: Ending up alone myself in the search for some fantasy I'll never realize; Staying in a marriage that amounts to a kind of platonic priesthood.

23 y/o male here. My girlfriend andihave been together ~4 years. We were each other's firsts. Our last sexual encounter was the morning after valentines day last year when she had a quickie with me because she felt bad for rejecting me the night before. Nothing since. Had hopes for tonight

We used to have a bit of a sex life; handjobs and fingering were frequent in the first year and a half. Sex a handful of times. Never oral -- she has zero interest giving or receiving. Before the last years pity-fuck, and then withold it if I wasnt doing what she wanted me to,but that seems to have stopped; we just don't do anything sexual now. Oddly enough, because the sex was never a regular thing, I don't find myself going crazy, maybe because I can't miss what I've never had. That said, I am always horny and ready to go

She is almost always fine with kisses, unless she's in a bad mood or watching tv or something (understandable), and every now and then she'll put my hand on her boobs, or touch my junk or something, but try as I might it is never followed by anything more.

I've to go all throwaway on this as my normal reddit account is well and truly known not just with my wife but friends and even family so apologies for the secrecy!  

On to the history.  We have been together for 13 years, and has caused a few fights between us.

Sexual history is that I've been with a few partners and have had a threesome while my wife has only been with me.  I consider myself to have a high sexual want and am quite open minded in the bedroom and I genuinely consider trying anything once (I apply this idea outside of the bedroom too). 

When it comes to frequency

I know this may sound a lot compared to some of the stories I've read in here but my main problem with having sex

She is the most beautiful and sexually attractive person I know.  I always compliment how great she looks, pick up kids from day care, cook, clean, etc.

We've had the talk so many times I have lost count.  We've covered every angle and it ends with both of us finding faults and agreeing to work harder on it

I came to the realisation today that my wife may actually just not be interested in sex.  I'm initiating pretty much all the time and the rejection or dashed hopes have finally taken their toll.  As above

There's so much sexuality I want to explore and I just feel like it would never happen

I'm really lost for what to do next.. I don't want to feel like this or be in this type of relationship but yet love her to death and only want for her to be as sexually interested as I am.

But I digress, nothing too kinky but when it happens my side the emotional connection is very high. We get very ""no, THAT was the best one ever."" and that parlay's into a good 2-3 days of sex, mostly quickies in the bathroom. Then life happens, we get tired and it stops. It seems that we either forget we had a connection or it was only physical and camouflaged the lack of one. 

Her boyfriend previous to me was completely whipped, too much other stuff in the house to do, or when she is feeling really hurtful or retaliatory I'll get a ""I have zero emotional connection to you, you disgust me."" I am aware that she knows how to cut deep, I don't think she means it. Honestly, I feel like the girl sometimes because I really want to have in-bed sex or make out with a lot of touching. She'll do a quicky from behind in the bathroom which is terrific but I've told her before that coming is my least favorite part of sex with her. I will sometimes be ""punished"" if I am not kind or helpful enough, if I breathe impatiently (sometimes intentionally) or my tone is not supportive by being given more chores or events taken from me. 

Additionally

 - I am not sure I like the -do all her work so she appreciates you. I work full time, mow the lawn, put away laundry and a lot of home improvement projects. I think this would further feed her ""earn me"" view of her role in the relationship.
 - The exude confidence so she is attracted to you appeals to me. I'm a little chubby and balding and not sure I have the time to do anything do justify any rise in my confidence. I am flirted with at work but I think it's only because I'm the harmless married guy. 
 - She has friends who are divorced. She see's that it's painful for the kids and that the girl usually has to find work. I think I'm a success-object (as opposed to sex-object) and I'm being used to fill in the blanks of her stay at home life.

Fast forward to the present day

I have tried the following to tell my partner that I'm not satisfied with our sex life: At the start when I noticed our sex diminishing
After 4-6months of starting the job
I sat down with him and asked about his masturbating habits
He said he didn't watch porn
I found porn on his computer, all optimal times for sex, and I'm always willing. 
Finally,but only when we are not together and IF it doesn't effect our sex life ( ie no initiating on his behalf, refusing blow jobs, lack of interest).

Well
I sat him down AGAIN

Well, trying to let this just ''happen'' and I am becoming more and more paranoid and resentful every day. I'm so convinced he masturbates before work that when he wakes up before me, I check the trash can when he's in the shower, too see if there is any 'evidence'.
 I'm so resentful that he doesn't seem to care about our sex life that sometimes I just have to literally bite my tongue because I'm afraid that I'm going to snap and let loose on him.

I've asked him straight out what turns him on, he says he always sees me  and feels horny, but he doesn't act on it.
I'm always ready for him, nails and hair are always well kept, I'm open to anything in the bedroom, just last week I offered him a blowjob twice on different days and he just shrugged,said no, like I was offereing him a cup of coffee.
I like anal
I have suggested to him to get a work up of bloods, that will be a miracle, but I don't think it's a hormonal problem because he masturbates.

The things that I have noticed about him is that he doesn't like talking about sex, cause arguments when I bring it up.
He says he's horny but he doesn't know why he doesn't go for it when he feels the urge.

I know people are going to suggest couples counselling, but I know my guy and I just don't see him talking to a stranger about our sexlife, when he can't even talk to me.

He has really bad anxiety about different things in life, which was fine and I never said ANYTHING about it. His anxiety started to worsen and he was depressed for a time so he went on a medication that completely shattered his libido. He could not get an erection. He stopped taking the medication and eventually he could maintain an erection again. But by that point, he had worked himself up negatively about maintaing an erection and pleasing me so much that it became and anxiety-driven activity. We didn't have sex more.

I have tried talking to him about it but every time I do

I don't know what to do. This situation is literally depressing me. I feel ugly, he is wasted out of his mind or high.

1372157250.0,1h141l,Think I've got a dying bedroom here,flyingzombiejesus,18,2,17,"I've been with the same girl

As time went on we both gained a bit of weight

We had a typical married/long lerm relationship sex life

In the last couple of years a few things happened that have put a crimp in things. 

1) We had our first (and so far only) child, as you can imagine an infant waking up at 5/6am sort of puts a dampener on that. Nap time at the weekend is used to get jobs done around the flat or catch up on sleep ourselves. By the time evening rolls around she's flagging, is in no mood for full sex and even when she's willing to try and finish me off another way she tends to fall asleep while doing so.

2) My Dad died suddenly, but enough that I'm back into my old fatso clothes again.

3) Possibly as a result of not giving a fuck following my Dad's death I got gently pushed out of my job with a 6 month payoff. Having just started calming down from binging following Dad's death this wasn't exactly what I needed. It was good to be at home with my family

--------------------
In the short term there are a few things that we can try and work on to give us more time to focus on our relationship:

1) me taking up more around the household. In the past I've tended to have a lazy man approach - ask me and I'll do it

New plan is that I bath the baby when I get home from work

2) I'm hoping to do a charity run in my dad's memory next year

I'm also back in work

----------------------

The main thing I'm worried about is that even before the baby/dad/job induced dry spell she didn't seem too interested in sex, but even when we are building up to sex she doesn't seem to want to reciprocate - I'll be stimulating her erogenous zones, getting obvious aroused reactions (legs parted, grinding crotch into me) but I never get any mutual play. Sex almost always devolves into foreplay (i.e. I finger/lick her till wet and ready). Then missionary/cowgirl sex until orgasm at which point she's satisfied and isn't interested in a second round. I can't remember the last time I had a blowjob either.

Sex only ever happens in bed

She is generally receptive to trying new thing I suggest, I feel like a teenager again at times.

I try and compliment her figure, but after a long while without sex I can't help it and often end up frustrated when she doesn't reciprocate. She also feels pressured when I get too horny which doesn't put her in the mood for loving. Then there are the odd occasions when intimacy is on the cards, but she kills the mood - as an example we were about to get it on, I had to nip back to the bathroom to grab the lube from my washbag as we'd been on holiday and hadn't finished unpacking. I got back to the bedroom to find her sat half on the bed with her head proped up with one hand with a bored expression on her face as if to say let's get this chore over with. Instant boner-kill. I don't want her having sex with me because it gets me out of her hair for a few weeks. I want to make love with her.

I love doing whatever I can to make her intimately happy.

Regardless if it's true or not, we all know the feels.

It's gotten to the point where I just don't even bother to initiate at times. I mean, all that's going to happen is I'll pour all of my passion into the 4 minutes it takes me to get her. She's a one and done gal, and I'll get a sad hand job.--You know like that card against humanity card that everyone says ""awh that's so sad"" to, yea.-- When I ask if I can get anything extra she just looks at me with a face that looks like a homeless person just hit on her, with a small hint of pain. You know the one.

But, and I hope to God she at least knows by now. When she asks ""What's wrong,"" she has to know. I would honestly be disappointed if she didn't actually know what was wrong. The paradox is that no physical intimacy makes HL people a bitch, which is certainly not attractive, which makes intimacy even harder.

At first, and we would do everything from full-on coitus to going down on me to fingering me, whatever. I'd give him hand jobs or blow jobs and sometimes we'd try different positions. All in all, good stuff.

Within the last couple of months, but whenever I try to turn him on or ask for sex, he says he's too tired or too distracted or too busy. I know he isn't cheating on me--in fact, it almost feels like he's gotten his fill of sex for this year or something and doesn't need to do anything intimate again for awhile. He doesn't even want to touch my breasts or make out, both of which are things I really like and will accept instead of sex if he's not in the mood.

I feel kind of silly about being in this position because he sort of warned me about this up front. We've both had one other sexual partner in our life

The sex got steadily worse as time went on

I'm trying not to be pushy about this--I know he acted this way somewhat with his last girlfriend, but I'm in great shape and I'm a very attractive person, and I often reach for him in bed or meet him naked or do other things to try and turn him on. What's the deal? I'd be happy if he'd just make out with me or feel me up or something every once in a while, but I get absolutely nothing. I'm getting kind of bitter about this whole situation, too. I'm trying to stay calm and be patient around him, but I sometimes get testy and snap at him for things he doesn't deserve to be yelled at for.

I've wasted an entire month of birth control pills because we haven't been having any sex. He left on a business trip a few days ago, and I told him a week before his departure that I really wanted to have sex at some point before he left. He promised we would, but it never happened. Now he's going to be gone for the next two weeks. 

I'm also frustrated about this because my last boyfriend and I had amazing sexual chemistry. We both had some hang-ups and reservations regarding sex when we started dating, wanted, and appreciated. Now I just feel...kind of insulted. I'm actually a little worried that he might be asexual.

* Sex starts first thing in the morning and lasts until evening. We plan it ahead of time. The whole day involves various levels of romance such as hanging out washing together or getting high on large amounts of chocolate.

* Keep the pressure off. Take an attitude of ""I'm happy that you're here with me"". It's hard, get frustrated, rage, sulk, etc. An appropriate reaction is ""I'm disappointed, but I still love you."". Go in with the expectation that it's not going to happen anyway, so you're not setting yourself up with disappointment. This is a long-term thing; pressure kills libido

Girlfriend 24(f) and I 26(m) have been dating for a little over a year. Usual story, experimenting, positions, dirty texts, etc. After 6-7 months, she moved in with me and things continued to be great. Of course, after the honeymoon phase (10 months or so) things slowed down and I noticed she stopped with the dirty texts, less spontaneity, claiming she was just busy at work. When we first started dating we talked about sex and how we have high sex drives

Her way of rejecting me started to get under my skin. I would try to kiss her when we first got in bed and she would give me ""pecks"" back, we can do it, get on top of me"" which can only be summed up as what felt like pity sex. We would still have exciting sex during the weekend but this type of rejection started happening more and more during the week. Eventually I spoke up and said ""I really dont like it when you ask me that, of course I want to have sex with you which is why I'm making a move. If you are into it just go with it, if not thats fine"". That talk really didn't change much and eventually I decided that pressuring her in any way for sex was a bad idea and I started to significantly drop off how much I would initiate. 

Time went by and I would rarely try to have sex with her at night during the week but I could tell she still knew I wanted it because of past discussions on sex drives, maybe twice during the week right before bed she would ask me ""oh wanna do it?"" I would ask her back ""do you?"", she goes ""can you come quick?"", I'll reply back ""maybe"" and then she says ""get on top of me"". As in I have to do all the work, shes too tired to put any effort in. To me, this translates to get on top of me and lets get this over with. Its effectively ""duty sex"" which I think 1 year into a relationship at 26 years old is a little ridiculous.

This ""get on top off me and can you come quick?"" initiations of hers started creeping into the weekend but I kept my mouth shut for a couple of months and just let it happen, only to still get rejected. Even on Valentines day, she fell asleep and woke up with me turning the lights off and said ""its Valentines day were supposed to do it"", I said ""dont worry you're sleeping, tomorrow we can"", to her saying ""can you come in 2 minutes?"". 

This all built up to last night where she asked the same question before we went to bed, can you come quick?"". My response, ""me on top, 5 minutes, got it"". But then something happened, she asked me a question I didnt want to answer but had to ""is that mean of me?"". I looked at her, feeling an opportunity and said ""can I be completely honest? I hear it more often than I like to"". She looked at me, I turned to her and tried to talk about the situation but it was just a mess, I'm not upset with the frequency of our sex but I would like my girlfriend to be a little more enthusiastic about having sex with me. The enthusiasm comment lit a fire under her ass because she then went off and said ""fine we'll stop having sex at all and only when I'm feeling enthusiastic about it"". I told her shes using sex as a punishment and she said I'm doing it to myself if I'm not happy with how shes ""putting out"". 

Reddit, kiss me, etc. If she would do all of those things and then right before say ""but I'm going to make you come quick cause I have an early day tomorrow"" it would be completely fine. At least shes showing interest in me and the act. Do we have passionate sex still? Yes but only on the weekends and that is starting to become less and less frequent, getting replaced by this ""lets just get it over with"" type of scenario. This morning she was trying to be sweet and said lets talk tonight when we get home. What the hell do I say? I want her to know that I value quality over quantity and that I dont want her to feel pressured into having sex with me because I dont even initiate anymore. Really, I just want her to be ""present"" when she does decide to have sex and do it for herself and not just to satisfy what she perceives as some chore or obligation. What should I say to her tonight without making this situation worse????

We starting dating in 2010 and the lack of physical intimacy was always chalked up to him saying that he just wasn't touchy, we only saw each other once a week, so when sex only happened once a month, I guess I just equated that we had sex 25% of the time we were together, so when we decided to live together it'd even out to be 1-2 times per week or more.  Right.


So long story short, so I went with it.  We were engaged for about a year before getting married and didn't have sex, oral, or any manual stimulation from one another for about 8-9 months of that year.


For the first week of marriage, things went south. We've been married for 10 months now and have sex about once every 4-6 weeks.  He puts his arm around me at night and we kiss and hold hands, but there isn't any passion behind anything as far as our intimacy goes.


Thus far:

* We've had the talk more times than I can count

* Been involved in couples counselling for about 7 weeks now

* I've written him a long

* Given suggestions for things that I'd like from him

* Asked him about his fantasies and offered to do *anything* he desires

* Had his T levels tested a few times (he's 450-550)


So many times, nothing ever changes.  And we go a few months until I'm so broken inside that we finally have ""the talk"" all over again.  


Rinse


It's gotten to the point that I feel disconnected from him emotionally a lot.  I just feel so alone and sad and rejected and I don't understand how he never seems to think about sex.  I just don't get it.  He doesn't look at porn, etc.  I've never seen him wake up with a hard on and he's never mentioned having any ""dirty"" dreams, says he doesn't have any fantasies, no specific desires to try anything new in the bedroom, etc. I feel like some kind of pervert and am ashamed of my sex drive most of the time.


I used to text him pictures or dirty messages, think about how nice it would feel to spoon or to cuddle, but I know that if I try, he'll pull away, so I just lay in bed and pull a pillow closer to me and cry.


He's mentioned things in the heat of the moment, completely shuts down about it.  I've tried to talk to him about buying lube, as well, but he avoids the topic or jokes about it.  Honestly, because we have sex so little, it's initially painful for me nearly every time and a little lube would be nice :(  I've expressed this and was shot down.


We're in counseling with a therapist and while I think it's helping him work through some personal/family issues from his past


Over the last week, which is the first time we've had sex back-to-back in that short a time period since the week of our wedding.  I want to be excited about that, but I'm so discouraged that I feel like I can't because I'm just expecting it to go right back to nothing for a month or more.  I don't feel like he even *looks* at me like ""that"".  I see other guys give me a once over, or stare at my chest, or look at my ass, but I never see his eyes linger on me like that... like he *wants* me.  Sigh.

I love my wife dearly and i am sexually attracted to her but i basically destroyed her self confidence by not being there sexually for her for the 7 years we have been married. We went for 6 months and even longer without sex (1.5yrs was the longest) however when we did

About 9 months ago i decided i had to change my behaviour, listen to my wife and look after her and the kids needs. I also gave up porn and controlled the masturbation so my desire to have sex with my wife returned with a vengeance.

At first my wife was quite receptive and we were having good sex again, i have been honest with her about the use of porn and she is understandably very upset. She feels like i have been cheating and it's causing issues again with sex.

Last week was terrible, whatever confidence had been instilled was now removed.

She told me that the physical side was over, nothing. I was utterly devastated, ashamed, guilty, That was on Wednesday. We didn't talk much until the Friday, we both had a long talk then and basically ended the marriage there and then. We would agree to stay together for the kids. I did ask if she still loved me and she said she didn't know any more, she didn't know who she was any more, personality

It goes without saying that i accept full responsibility for what i have done

On Sunday morning i wrote my wife a letter and laid bare everything about myself, as some way of explaining my behaviour, i feel like a pretty messed up person but that for the last year or so i am trying and maybe trying too hard and freaking her out.

We had another long talk last night and have decided to try and get over it. She explained how she had been let down in the past, running on autopilot, how she felt i thought she is unattractive and undesirable. I explained as best i could how i did still have those feelings for her, but she is obviously still very much broken inside.

So at the moment, but i think the physical side is still a major hurdle.

I understand that my wife is going to need a lot of time to heal, confident and sexual self, since she refuses to see a councillor.

Any advice is most welcome.

tl;dr - I destroyed my wife's confidence by withholding sex for years. Getting slowly back on track but she is still broken inside.

While we were dating, but it always seemed like kinky stuff was ""porn stuff"" and our sex was ""regular."" I like to be more creative, but he never seemed very comfortable with that even though we would talk about it. Even so, mutual enthusiasm was still there and it wasn't hard to be or get ""in the mood.""

After we got engaged, I joined a website did webcam shows for money for a couple months (never anything beyond that), and he found out about it and hit the roof. He was very upset about my doing that with other men, which was understandable. But what made him the most upset was, I think, that I was doing ""porn stuff."" I made the mistake of telling him that I thought it was fun and exciting and that we could maybe do it together, and he literally went nuclear and we actually weren't engaged for a while. 

We worked through it and got married, it was turned down or met with negativity. Efforts to learn how to please me were deemed ""too difficult."" The enthusiasm turned into silence and routine. He eventually got over his anger and it's been years since then, but a lot of the bedroom habits remained like the silence and routine and lack of creativity and undercurrent of repression. I started getting incredibly frustrated because everything I tried was getting shot down, I wasn't getting satisfied, and I was being blamed for things not working out. 

I admit that it eventually made me lose my attraction and motivation to even have sex because I just don't get anything out of it at all. I can't really explain how it's almost physically painful to always get ""some of the way there"" or worse, I feel like it's conditioned me to not get excited during sex because I'll just get left hanging.

Strangely enough, but he still acts like he's the only one in the room and does things according to his comfort, not my enjoyment. He keeps doing porn move-type things I don't like, and it turns me off and makes me frustrated. I tell him to do it differently because I don't like it, and he gets mad. I try to get a little creative and he clams up like I'm going to anally rape him with my vibrator and post it on Xtube.

When we were first dating, the sex life was great. Spontaneous. She is and always was a very beautiful woman.

Then we got engaged, during that period - she worried one thing would lead to another.

My God, very occasional. There have been times where we've done it several times a month; some very steamy occasions. There have also been periods where we've gone 6 months, or even longer, without it.

I did have an affair once

For my wife, her legs aren't shaved, she doesn't ""feel"" pretty/sexy and isn't in the mood when she doesn't feel right. When we go out - when she gets all dolled up - those are the times we wind up in bed. Be nice to have more of those times, but with 3 young kids and finances tight, well...

For 2 years

Then she ran into a year of various unlucky illnesses that compromised the pace of our sex life but the illnesses were temporary and I survived the year.  Things were beginning to turn around and I could see the light at the end of the tunnel.  She was feeling better and that meant that I was getting proper laid... things were looking up.

Then she was again very unlucky.  Someone rear-ended her in a terrible car accident that has given her a host of issues like major back problems

She works her ass off everyday to get better, massage and anything else that she thinks will help her get back to a 100%.  Her work ethic is unimpeachable when it comes to her recovery.

Now to the dead bedroom part... We have sex about 3 times a month and it consists of maybe 15 minutes of her placating me(Same 2 positions and no oral).  It happens because she generally knows that I'm going mental with horniness and she honestly wants to make me happy.  I'd say about 10% of the time

Then the cycle continues and we have cursory sex the next nine times that it happens.  No oral

My sexual needs are making me very

She's the one for me and I can see us lasting together till we're old.  Literally all the aspects of our relationship work really well except the sex which is directly related to forces outside of her control.  It isn't an issue of her attitude or low libido.  She's got plenty of libido when she is healthy so I know that one day she'll recover enough from the accident to make our sex life satisfying again.

Thus my problem.  I am literally dying on the inside because I need sex.  I know very well that most of you know how I feel about being in a deadbedroom but I have no one to blame(except maybe the guy who caused the car accident).

I can't share how I really feel about our sex life(I have had 'the talk' with her a couple times) with her because she is doing everything she can and all that would accomplish at this point is to make her sadder about it than she already is and drive us further apart.

I don't want to leave her

We've talked previously about opening up the relationship but that was when she was healthy and I don't think she really wanted it to happen.  Now I know she'd not want it to open up due to the imbalance of that equation now.  She worries that she'd lose me to someone else.

What the hell am I supposed to do?  

Destroy my satisfying relationship to be single?(I don't want that)

Massage Parlour?(scares me

Pay for sex?(cost prohibitive

Start an affair? (afraid of getting caught and breaking her heart) This seems like the only answer I can think of but I know this is the one if I was found out would hurt her the most.

Our lives are entwined

My DB situation is driving me crazy. I (23F) have been with my (26M) boyfriend for going on 5 years. We connect in every way BUT sexually. He has a nonexistent libido, I didn’t know why until a few months into our relationship but the story goes a year or two before we met he was injured and had surgery in his groin area, a hernia repair. He says ever since after the surgery his libido is just gone. At the beginning of our relationship we did have sex, but I noticed right off the bat something was “off”. He never really initiated which was ok because I have an extremely high sex drive and had no problem “attacking” him and getting what I wanted. That worked for a while.  Eventually it did get worse and worse, we have had many fights about it.  I’ve tried to compromise with we don’t have to have sex, but pleasure me in other ways, but it doesn’t happen. He wont even touch me down there and I’m pretty sure he’s gone down on me less than 10 times in 4 years. The only way he has ever explained his extremely low sex drive to me is: “when the “average” man sees a girl walk by in a short skirt or something they might get a “tingle” or be like ooooh yeah, I don’t even notice”. 
 I love this man and the thought of not being with him is just as sickening as the thought of never having a decent sex life. I mean I’m 23, I’m desperate. Is anyone else in a similar relationship where a partner has a low sex drive due to an injury or illness? How do you cope? Your thoughts/stories/advice is much appreciated.

Bit of back story: Me (23F, but his sex drive started to taper off around the 6 months mark to about 2 - 4 times a month. Sometimes the sex was great

Here's the long story:

A couple weeks ago I brought it up again, *if he could change how he feels, would he?* he said he would. He just keeps saying he doesn't know what to do. At this point I am feeling like perhaps he has a low thyroid or low testosterone. The discussion was ended on me confirming I loved him and we'd work through this. For the past month we have not had any sex at all.  Now that I've stopped pressuring his efforts at romance/affection have sky rocketed. Compared to the tension in the relationship before, I'm really enjoying this.

BUT WE ARE STILL NOT HAVING SEX! In the last year he's gotten very fit in terms of working out, his work situation has improved. All extrinsic factors that low libido is blamed on are covered. I'm preparing myself to ask him to see a doctor/endocrinologist for some blood work and praying its as simple as taking supplementary testosterone. I have dreams of this getting fixed and us living happily every after but I'm young damnit, and the norm seems to be that it never gets better. He's more affectionate than ever but knowing someone doesn't want to have sex with you is a huge ego kill and I'm beginning to resent him. Its heartbreaking to think this is something he can't control and I might have to leave him when its no fault of his own; I'm really torn.

**TL;DR - Had the talk, he just doesn't want one. Preparing to ask him to look into low testosterone. Not sure if I should have hope for a solution or face the inevitable that things need to end.

We split up for about a year. In that time I dated someone who was closer to my age. It wasn't the best relationship. The guy was kind of unstable, so I think I stuck around pretty much for that reason. It ended when it seemed like he might become physically abusive.

I ran into my old boyfriend out of the blue one day. He's been through a lot of counseling and has attended support groups regularly for the past year. He's doing better in a lot of ways. We started dating again

But now things are going south again. He started having issues keeping an erection again, flopping on top of me and squishing me, unenthusiastic humping without making a sound until he loses his hard-on, wants me to play with his limp dick for half an hour, or more, and keeps claiming that he's really close to having an orgasm when that's clearly not true. It ends when I tell him I've got a hand cramp and just stop doing it. He won't try new positions. 

After dealing with this a couple times I tried to talk to him about it. I gently said that I'd noticed the erectile issues and it was a problem. I didn't even get into the other things. He apparently didn't notice that he was having trouble keeping an erection? I'm not a man and I don't have a penis

So, but this time it lasted about 10 seconds and he went to sleep. I am so beyond frustrated with this. I left the room and pretended I wanted a shower but I was really just trying not to cry. I'm extremely frustrated and I don't know what to do, but I'm at the point of leaving.

I used to be depressed about an ex-boyfriend who never wanted sex, and instead of depression I feel rage that I'm married to someone who will only have sex with me when I'm not horny.

Details follow.

----------

After a lifetime of atheism/agnosticism, like the Catholic teachings on homosexuality and same-sex marriage. I have been ignoring/saving these issues for last, knowing they could be deal-breakers.

Over the past few years I've come to realize that I let go of all my close friends because I was afraid of offending them with my ""new beliefs"". I constantly censored myself to try to save my Catholic identity. I came to loathe myself for losing my exciting, and I don't feel like I can share much with them.

My health deteriorated through the course of our marriage, and my personality.

I think that becoming Catholic really did help me stay afloat. Because of my illness, but I can no longer see myself raising children in a church setting.

Over the years, sex, and stability. I think that two are great, but two are suffering. (Are there other modes that I am neglecting?)

Friendship: My husband is my best friend and my biggest supporter who helps me deal with all of my health and emotional issues.

Financial stability: We've both grown in many ways

Philosophy: Here we diverge. As I've mentioned

Which brings me to my biggest problem - Sex: My sex drive was fairly low for the past couple of years because of my depression and ill health. Now that I understand MS, this was not a problem. But now I have a healthy raging desire to have sex with my husband, but the main point of NFP is that you DO NOT have sex when the woman is fertile, which is when I am most desirous. This is driving me batshit insane, because basically I'm only allowed to have sex with my husband when I'm only sort-of into it.

I find myself fantasizing about tons of the men and women who I help at my job. I get to the point where I feel like I want to proposition the nearest person and head out for a quickie. And I try to be calm

I share everything with my husband. We've begun to discuss my loss of faith and my frustrations with not using contraception, I had to leave work early in tears, so I scheduled an appointment with an MS psychologist, and when my husband got home, I told him everything.

I also told him that these things seem consistent with bipolar disorder, and then I sort out my problems with the relationship and get the hell out of it. I'm hesitant to call it a problem though, because it has saved me several times: it provided the confidence that I needed to leave a few relationships that were genuinely not good. But now I'm confused and terrified, because my husband is a wonderful, good, and amazing person, and I NEVER had any doubt about our marriage until I got MS and lost my faith.

I'm worried that we won't last without religion. And I'm worried that if we do last

Since I haven't stayed in touch with my old secular friends, guess what, I have MS and I'm not really Catholic, can you talk to me about my problems?"" So I'm here on reddit looking for perspectives. Catholic, secular, married, single, whatever. Thanks for anything you've got.

1370032244.0,1ffc15,"DB (new baby, depression, loneliness) for Dad",adios12345,18,6

My wife (31F LL) and I (34M HL) have been married 7.5 years. Together we are proud parents of a new 6.5 month old. My wife is a great mother and my child is perfect. My wife is also breast feeding which I have heard has an impact on some women.

Since our child's birth we have had sex once (4 mo. ago).  It was terrible.  It felt forced and as if she was going through the motions.    Any other sexual advances (kissing

Prior to our child's birth we had an awesome 6mos of dating as I finished graduate school and her undergrad school.  Then we had 2 years of long distance and we have had 7.5 years of a normal 2+/- times a week sex life. 

We did have a challenge over the last 3-4 years with infertility and miscarriage.  I have a low sperm count and over those years our efforts to get pregnant were unsuccessful. We lost one child to miscarriage.  One day we just got lucky.

My infertility was very hard on me but I feel like I have come out of it better than ever. In general I feel as a person I am doing really well.  I am in the best shape of my life.  I recently won a state wide award for work. I am kind and hard working husband to my wife and father to our son.

I have tried to talk to her about our relationship but it always just ends in crying and both of us feeling worse.  My wife over our marriage has gained significant weight (60lbs) and I think she is self conscious over this issue having seen my dedication to exercise over the past 4 years.  To me her current weight isn't stopping me from sexing her up.  I am proud she is starting to at least try to do something to become more healthy after pregnancy.  I was also very proud of how she took care of our child during pregnancy.  At the end of any discussion I come away feeling like she does not take my hopes / desires seriously. 

The major questions I find myself asking:

1. Am I not attractive anymore? (I think I'm the most attractive I've ever been)

2. Maybe I'm just bad at sex? (This sexual relationship was great early on and I have had other good sexual relationships prior.  I would do anything to give her the best sexual experience I can.)

3. Is there something non sexual I am not doing for her?  (she compliments me on what a great dad I am and how I am such a good husband quite often?)

4. Is she broken?  I have suggested her seeing someone about weight loss and lack of libido.  I would come to if that would help to talk about it.

5. What can I do?  Every thing I try to do just makes my resentment higher and depression worse.

Bottom line it looks like I have a wonderful mother to my son but I want a lover and partner too.

I feel so stupid for even writing this.  If my wife read this I think she would be crushed but I have to vent this somewhere.

I am sorry if it has English

==============EDITED FOR UPDATE============== 

Finally had a good conversation on this topic last night.  The discussion finally felt normal again and I think I learned a lot more about what she/we are going through.  We had some limited sexy time that I think was good for both of us and it was great to hear what felt good and what didn't with this new body from her.  Are we 100% no way but the communication makes me feel like we will grow and be back better than ever.

One reason I am extremely optimistic about the future is that we are doing quite awesome (in my opinion) on raising this baby.

Looking back I think I/we were really prepared for the pregnancy BUT TOTALLY UNPREPARED FOR THIS FIRST SIX MONTHS OF LIFE.  No one ever told us some of these post baby secrets regarding body transition out of pregnancy, sex life etc.  The things we knew about we are handling awesomely (work, feeding, diapers, play time, walks, exercise

I think the main issue we had is we just weren't communicating on the things we weren't ready for. In all reality this is probably the first  challenge we haven't been able to immediately talk our way through.  I feel like I have my teammate back on my life trip.

Here goes.. I am married to my husband for 1.5 years, they are always fairly soft and he usually loses them before penetration. The few times his erection stayed hard long enough for penetration, he came in seconds. 

Also

Initially we tried often, viagra and a flyer with info. Viagra worked to some extent, but he was not keen on it so we didn't pursue that further (although that was by far the best sex we had together). His initial theory was that it's due to shyness and lack of experience, which sounded plausible. He suggested that we should keep trying and that things will slowly improve. 

After four years though, I have pretty much gone off sex: I know that I will have to initiate for anything to happen anyway, and given that I know how it will end, I just can't be bothered. He doesn't really try anymore either, but I guess I don't give the most encouraging signals at this point. I am convinced that it is not psychological or lack of experience issue but rather mostly physical. He can get erections and he can come but his erections are never particularly hard and he comes too fast. Other than that, our relationship is awesome but I don't want to have a marriage without sex. 

This has been pretty hard to deal with so far, etc etc. So should I keep trying? Should he go see a doctor again and get some tests? What do you think Reddit?

I'm in my early 40s my wife is a couple of years younger than me. We met when we were both in our late tenns and married when I was 23 and she was 20. 

All pretty typical I think for here in that we were at it like bunnies at the beginning. She was never super adventurous but we would go at it pretty much anytime we could. For us both this was our first serious relationship
I was understanding and we would make love when we could but it got rarer and rarer.
So fast forward to now and even though our kids are pretty grown up

We went from a couple of times a week to a couple a month and now
Thing is she just isn't interested, shes told me as much.
If I ever try to initiate I get the laughing - ""stop being silly"" answer. so pretty much I don't bother

So I expect some grief from this but I've spent a large part of the past 10 years having affairs

Im not looking for absolution just saying its been my way to deal with it. In most other aspects our relationship is fine, we share interests in movies and TV shows (mostly). She is pretty, slim but I just can't see her as a sexual person anymore.

I have thought so many times about leaving the marriage. It truly has been a miracle that none of this has come out or that I havent been caught over the years. I've gotten good at covering my tracks I guess.
I know I will never stop doing this

So why don't I leave? I love my kids, as selfish as all the stuff I've done. Probably a shrink would say deep down I want to get caught so I get thrown out, taking away the decision making process.

I do know in the cold light of day that I'm treating my family like absolute crap by continuing like this. My kids are mid and late teens so in truth I think they would handle a breakup ok.

Although I know from her opinions on friends of hers that have divorced - she has told me ""if you ever leave me I will take you for every cent and poison the kids against you"" - so that's kinda sobering thought.
To address an earlier point other women constantly tell me how attractive I am and really I have never had a problem finding women

I posted a [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/18eqrc/just_a_rant_opinions_are_appreciated/c8e51ze) a few days ago about my experience with my nearly 3 year DB and how I broke up with my LL SO

You can read my post history here, telling them that I couldn't imagine how someone in  DB *marriage* felt because I couldn't even see the way out of a dating relationship! 

But I'm here to tell you that **there are happy endings**. Each and every one of you deserves a happy ending....but it may not be in the way you want it to. Of course, my job wasn't done. But then, something clicked. Our relationship would never be the same. Sure, he could ""change"" and want the sex and intimacy again, but would I be able to accept his love? I didn't even know what it felt like to be normal anymore. I had forgotten what a healthy sex and intimate life was. I had forgotten what it felt like to be wanted, to have a mutually fulfilling sexual experience. But I wanted all of that so badly! I realized it couldn't be with my LL boyfriend. Our relationship could never be 100% again because I would never fully believe that he was attracted and desired me. I just knew it. I knew I would always second guess his motives, I knew that I would always talk myself down in front of him, because his presence reminded me of everything I hated about myself. He was not helping my life

I broke up with him and we both cried for hours. He swore he was going to change, he actually *had* been getting better. But I still new that even if *he* could recover, I couldn't. The cut had been too deep and I had felt so sorry for myself for too long. I needed to be free, even though I so desperately wanted him to want me. He said he loved me, that he was attracted to me, that I was the best thing that ever happened to him...but I still held my ground. He even came back to my house the next day with flowers, begging me for forgiveness and for another change. But I was already long gone in spirit. I needed a fresh start, not me. Until I broke ties with him

I was so upset the next day, and they brought a few new people. One of those guys really caught my eye. He looked at me differently, his eyes seemed so soft and so understanding. Nothing like my ex. I knew that I had to move on, and I wouldn't move on until I had allowed myself to feel vulnerable and open to another man again. Yes, I dived into a new ""relationship"" right away. I can't call it a rebound, because I had been so disconnected from my ex for so long, it had felt like we had broken up *months* earlier. Now I'm not particularly religious, but I call this new man an answer to my prayers. 

We began to talk and got to know each other. He would randomly compliment me

They say ""you don't know what you've got until it's gone"", stop wearing tight clothes around him, etc. I would even just look up at him and he would laugh and tell me to stop looking at him in such a sexy way. Me....sexy?! Was this guy on drugs?! 

I told my new guy about my ex a few days later. I told him everything....because I knew that he would still like me. That's a valuable thing to have. With my ex, or do anything that would turn him off even more. But with this guy....I felt the bond, the attraction, the chemistry. I could walk around with no makeup and he'd still want to fuck the shit out of me. I could put on a sweatshirt when I was cold and he'd still imagine me naked. I was a woman, a woman with power again. I felt like I could take over the world. 

We got more comfortable with each other, I found myself having....phone sex. What. I hadn't been with a guy who actually knew what he wanted in so long. He would tell me what he wanted to do to me, and I had never felt more comfortable with myself. This new guy made it okay for me to be a sexual being. He *wanted* me to. He actually wanted to hear about what I liked and disliked. He wasn't ""weirded out"" if I mentioned masturbation. I felt *normal*. It was (and is!) so exciting...to be able to buy lingerie and rock it again. Even the most plain sex with him is better than the most wild sex with my ex because *I know he wants to be there*. He's present, he's willing, he's eager. I know he's not having sex with me because he feels like he should. He's not kissing me because it's been a month and I'm in a bad mood. He's not complimenting me just so I won't leave him for someone else. He want me all on his own, and for genuine and pure reasons. 

This is possible for you. 2 weeks ago I didn't feel like it was possible for me. My mother says that every pot has a lid. Just find your own. It took me some time to realize that my ex wasn't a good match for me. Don't feel like you're worthless, sexy, and *normal*. Ah, normalcy. Sweet, sweet normalcy.

1357142879.0,15twkc,I've just found this subreddit. Here's my story:,d-spare,23,7,27,"Hi all.


I've just found this subreddit and am so glad to find people in the same position as me. As a coping mechanism I really wanted to write down my thoughts and feelings and may even pluck up the courage to show my wife this message and any responses.


I married my wife nearly 5 years ago (we've been together over 10 years in total) at which point we were still having sex but at an alarmingly infrequent basis. When we were first together we were at it like rabbits but I'm now sat here having not had sex for somewhere between 2 and 3 years (I've forgotten the last time we had sex).


My wife is my best friend. I feel so lucky to have her in my life and every day I can't believe I am married to such a beautiful woman. Now at this point you probably have jumped to the conclusion that she's cheating on me. Obviously I have no proof however I have outright asked her and genuinely believe that she hasn't.

There are a number of factors that I believe are killing our sex life but I'm not sure if any one of them is responsible or all of them:

Kids: She got pregnant with her previous boyfriend. She was around 18 and had a termination. She has made her mind up that she doesn't want children and even though I probably do I'm willing to forgo the passing on of my genes if it meant I could have a life with her. I think the thought of getting pregnant is scaring her when we have sex and even with protection (pill + condom) I think it plays on her mind that none of these are foolproof.

Health: The last couple of times we had sex it was physically painful for her. She says it was due to thrush however I have two theories on this. I think she may have something wrong that she is too embarrassed to get seen, she may not be wanting sex due to physical discomfort.

Appearance: When I met her, long hair, piercings, a bit of a rebel and unemployed. She was a goth in to the same kind of stuff and we were instantly attracted to each other. I'm now 30, 175 lbs, no piercings short hair and have a super-responsible job (which is supporting both of us, she has a job but the earnings are minimal). She left goth-kind too and dresses extremely nicely and has grown in to an extremely attractive 30 year old.

I also have to consider that she just doesn't love me any more. We are still best friends and our relationship is going well other than sex. I'm feeling like her gay best friend!

I've started seeing a personal trainer

I cant figure out if the problem is her

I genuinely don't want this relationship to end

If anyone can related and give me any advice I'd really appreciate it whether it be saving the sex life or formulating an exit strategy.",,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/15twkc/ive_just_found_this_subreddit_heres_my_story/

I have the typical story going on in my db

However now that we are getting past the holidays I feel like I need to address the issue one more time.  I feel like I need to take a hard stance this time.. kind of an all or nothing situation.  The reason being is that we are on track to buy a house together in the next 6 months

I am afraid to move forward with her knowing that I could be resigning myself to a sexless life.  I am planning on sitting down with her and telling her that if we are not at least trying to address the issue I will not move forward on the house and children.

I guess this leads me to my two questions.

* How can I tell if we are truly making progress and that is not just buckling down and giving me what I want in the short term so she can have what she wants in the long term?

* I need to find an outlet for my sexual tension, however if I do not do something to take the edge off I feel like I might snap.  Me going off the handle starting a fight only serves to make this issue worse, at least that is the way I see it.

My SO is not good at communication. He has a difficult time putting int owords exactly how he feels. Getting answers and his honest opinion are like pulling teeth. I had ""The Talk"" with him many times. From all of these talks, confessions, ""solutions"", ""goals"", etc, this is what I have heard from him:


Reason 1. At first he said it was because of my weight. This is an issue for me because I'm completely average and healthy weight-wise, and my SO, being the type to heavily rely on his friends' opinion, gradually started to adopt the same view toward my body. 

Reason 2. When he told me a few months later that it wasn't in fact my body that was the problem, this is his viewpoint) that he had to sort of ""train"" himself to not expect or want sex in order to deal with the fact that I rejected him a lot. Also, we are semi-long distance for nearly the entire relationship, so he said that not being able to have sex with me very often because of the distance also made him gradually not interested.

Reason 3. Then, he told me ""I used to look forward to every weekend when I would get the chance to have sex with you again. Now I actively avoid it"". He's not on *any* medication. He's been to the therapist. No depression. No drugs, doesn't drink. No ED whatsoever. Goes to the gym 5 times a week and eats healthy. Not insecure with his body or sexual performance at all. So I have a hard time believing his libido could change *so* drastically like that. And no, we've had no real issues outside of this in our relationship (so no triggering trauma or family, school, work issues, etc.)

Reason 4. After he decided that he did, he told me that he still wouldn't mind having sex *in general*, it was just that sex *with me* sounded very unappealing. Not just ""meh"", but completely awful. He told me that while he didn't think I was unattractive, just *certain parts of my body* turned him off. So, I toned up even more (lost 10 pounds over the summer actually), and nothing changed-he didn't even notice the change in my body.

5. Then he changed his mind *again* and told me that he always felt pressure to do lots of foreplay and have sex for a long period of time that it became tiring and felt like a chore. I told him how sorry I was that he felt that way, I told him that it was my fault for not communicating sexually that he didn't need to spend a long time with foreplay and that he should only have sex until he felt like orgasming. (He told me that having sex when you really want to cum is very unpleasant and made him not want to have sex at all). 

5. About 5 months ago I reached a breaking point with of his drama. Throughout all of these number's I've listed

And the thing is

So, and that he had been trying and feeling pressure throughout the last 2 years to change, which actually made his problem worse. I told him that he shouldn't feel bad if he wasn't sexually attracted to me. But he did, oh, so bad. He was crying (which is *never* does) and talking about how awful he felt...long story short, we both decided to keep working on it. 

We had another falling out about 2 months ago, I chalked it up to a moment of fear over losing a 3 year LTR, and cut all contact. 

A week went by and he left me alone. The, here's the boy who I still love, who hurt me, that I desperately want approval from. I want him to want me. But, I tried to be the stronger person and end a relationship that I thought was going no where. 

We went on dates, that when he would reject me again, it would hurt even more. But I was so confused. We had been romantic and intimate all throughout our relationship. I didn't know what I did wrong to make him change like this. After a few weeks of talking, we decided to try dating again. 

And that's where I am now. He has done an excellent job as far as sheer number of sexual encounters we've had

1. My SO gets sort of uncomfortable when talking about sex. He has *no* fantasies, BJs, etc.) So, I can't exactly ""spice things up""…in fact, he says he enjoys the sex we have (which is about a vanilla as it gets).

2. I asked my SO if he wanted me to initiate more (I thought maybe he was the responsive desire type). He said that was a turn off actually. So

3. I told him exactly what I wanted from him, he *sort of* does it for a few times, then stops again. 

4. Now, groping, etc.) that he's not really into it. I feel like he's doing it because he's going through the motions and trying to be a better boyfriend. He swears that he loves me and the sex we're having…but it seems so lackluster when it used to be so passionate. I told him this, and he told me that he thinks that no matter what he does, I'll still continue to feel and insist that I am unwanted by him because of the past hurt and insecurity I face. I worry that this could be true.**

Is that the truth? We still only have sex 2-3 times a month. The problem with this is the fact that we can only see each other on the weekends. I wonder if we saw each other every day how often we would actually do it. Yes

I guess I've typed out this novel because everything is so complicated. Now I don't know if I'm the one with the problem or if he is. Is he really changing? I don't know. He has done a similar thing in the past

**TL;DR: Boyfriend flip-flops on reasons for LL. I try to be supportive and make personal changes to help. Doesn't work. I break up with him. After a few weeks we talk again and he acts like a changed man. Sex is more frequent

We have had talks in the past.  She has severe body issues.  She is seeking help.  But I don't even know if she feels we have a problem.  We don't talk about it anymore as all talks led to her going down a list of all the things I do wrong.  I've never been good at arguing and when I do fight back she yells at me for being defensive.  After awhile it's not worth the fight.

I have thought of leaving, either I would feel guilt for leaving her practically destitute or the state would just have me support her for a while (which I can't afford as I barely make it as is).

This is a throwaway due to the fact that I finally felt the need to post after lurking for so long.  Because this week she finally said something that just crushed me.  Suggesting that I would have to get her plastered to even think of us having sex.  She didn't say it with cruelty and it's hard to explain the context it was said in.  But it crushed me and kind of woke me up to my insane denial.  We will never have sex again.  If I stay with her...I will either have to cheat or go without for the rest of my days.

Long story short

Due to the economical crisis we had to stay at my mom's house (consisting of myself, my job for example always owed me 1 month of wage from how bad they were doing. Since we couldn't move out we stuck around until 2 months ago when we finally moved out. Living in a home like that is very...depressing to have sex, to top it off never having the chance of having some privacy.

The reason we haven't had much sex was because of how stressed I always was, I was hospitalized from stress and after that I was fired). I have type 1 diabetes which is now well controlled, back then my diabetes wasn't well controlled due to the stress of course and lack of money to be able to see an endocrinologist.

I started feeling worse

I was very ill for about 2 years thanks to endometriosis

This is a whole bigger story combined of course but it is years and years of problems that will take ages to write down


I haven't been diagnosed with depression but I am sure it is there. I think everything that has been happening all these years has caused me to be so worried and stressed that I have other priorities in my head than sex.


Another thing is that he begs me for it, he nags, he whines, he demands. He is a healthy young male so I understand it is normal (I want sex too!) but I tried telling him that it feels like harassment, that I have so many things on my mind at the moment that him begging me for it actually puts me off! I told him to PLEASE give me a few days of break considering the situation, as I am most certain if he stops chasing me and treating me as if I were some kind of fuck hole (excuse the language, but this is how I feel) I would be more inclined to do it.

I do think of sex, it feels like a chore instead of something I would enjoy when he acts like this. I tell him to please back off a little bit, see if it works and I am certain I will initiate it because I won't have the constant worry in my mind about the sex issue. I need to not associate it with a chore or with a problem. He simply calls bullshit...

Another thing that is happening because he is frustrated and says he is depressed because of lack of sex

When he shouts I can't help but get terrified as it reminds me of how things started to get bad with my father. I know it may not be the case but I can't help to get frightened and I get a bit panicked and remove myself from the situation. I have tried explaining it to him but he doesn't seem to understand that either. Obviously this is a mood killer for a few days as I have to try and get my mind out of the state of ""It is going to happen again

He says he wants to end the relationship due to lack of sex. I understand his frustration
The endometriosis set me back a lot, he whines and complains about that too...I have to show him my meter to prove it is real. Sometimes stress itself makes it rise for no reason, I don't know.

Then the whole trying to end my life thing 3 weeks ago I just find his behaviour *at the moment* very inappropriate. I try to talk to him and have him understand as I do understand him

What am I doing wrong? How can I make him happier? Should I just do my best to disconnect and put out?

8 year relationship
Healthy sex drive in both partners


I'm not sure how or when our relationship started falling apart. At some point I guess we stopped touching - no cuddles on the couch. No snuggling in the morning. Smooch before work, mostly OK but we both wanted more (but didn't know how to communicate to get it.) I'm not sure when, or if it was on purpose, but I stopped initiating sex.


Then I clued in - SO would only touch me on nights where he would later initiate sex. Something small - tickle one of my toes on the couch. This realization, I went still went along with having sex, but it went down to once a month. I wasn't enjoying it, but did it for the relationship. 


Those little touches once a week or so made me dread going to bed.


I started to play the avoidance game. Stay up late when he has to get up early. Go to bed super early when he had to work nights.


Neither of us said anything about what was happening. 


I know it wasn't completely up to him to fix it, or maybe he just didn't care. 


The only thing he did to approach the subject was to say a very sad ""good night"" when it was clear that I was in bed but going to sleep


That made me feel so guilty and so sad (because I was hurting him) but also angry that he wanted to have sex but wasn't man enough to bring it up or try to talk about it


Then I took a new job where I had a huge learning curve. My brother got married and we had the stress of traveling halfway around the world (planning and paying for it all my responsibility) and then I had to pretend to my family that all was well with SO (they love him.) He seemed fine the whole time. We were still having sex once a month or so (once during our trip)


After we got back


I went to bed willing, I went along with his advances (since I was the one who initiated it) but then it was clear to me that he was just in it for himself. He pulled down my clothes, did what he had to, and that was it. No attempt at foreplay, nothing nice afterwards. 


I left to sleep on the couch. 


I felt horrible.


I started to stay away as much as possible - out with friends, whatever.


He still stalked me around the house at bedtime.


I couldn't take it anymore.


I emailed him and said we needed to talk. Said that I knew he wanted to have sex


He replied


Two weeks passed


I aired all of my problems - he only wanted sex, does not make plans or have friends independently from me despite my encouragement (and sometimes frustration.) 


Every major decision he's made


That was in September. Since that talk


I don't know what I'm looking for here on reddit


It just sucks so much.

Since November marks the third anniversary of this sad endeavour I had to bring it up at the two month mark. She responded at first by crying and asking me not to leave her.

We have been married for four months, once a month *maybe*.  Now, nothing.

Everything else about our relationship is perfect and I could not ask for more.  We are on the same page about everything except the no sex issue.  The idea of having sex with anyone other that him is completely abhorrent to me

When we were dating things were fine, and I am so grateful.)  Then in March I had a heart attack.  We are both 30, so this was completely unexpected on both fronts.  

My doctor has told him that it's okay for me to have the sexytimes.  I just needed to spend a majority of my time resting and ended up quitting school and my job.  He used every excuse in the book

I try to behave like a responsible and mature adult by always coming to him with any of my relationship concerns, what I think the issues are and wanting to know how we can address it.  I don't make passive aggressive posts to Facebook or trash talk him to his friends.  The first words out of his mouth whenever I tell him I am depressed, sad, not feeling well, or upset are always ""How can I help.""  ""What can I do.""  He gets upset with himself that I'm upset and lays out how he will take care of the situation, because ""You deserve to be happy and I will do everything I can.""  Except when it comes to the ""trouser problem""...nothing happens.  

He has promised for the past month to see a doctor but he won't even find the time to schedule the appointment.  It's always ""I'm busy with school.  There's a rehearsal tomorrow.  There's a concert coming up.""  To this I said ""You are a band director.  This is your life, but I didn't think that he would put off our health issues so that rehearsals could take precedence.  

He never had problems managing time like this before the stroke.  Not only this, focusing on his job seems to be the only thing he really can do 100%...we only had sex once on our honeymoon, on the next to last day, and even then he wanted to cut our honeymoon short and go home a day early so that he could work on stand tunes for the new marching season.

But yes, maxed out my Victoria's Secret credit card, gotten brazillian waxes.  He still gives me kisses and hugs and tells me I'm beautiful.  I don't see it anymore.  I get honks from men who are stopped at the same intersection as me wanting to get my number, I get propositioned in the grocery store.  And I want no part of them.  I am so hurt that I can have men walking down the street hit on me and the only man I want to touch me can't be bothered.  I really do look in the mirror and not see anything that makes me beautiful.  I think I look fat in my wedding dress.  I can't look.  I've already had some issues coping with my heart attack and the fallout from that.  I was working on a second bachelor's while working and I've had to cut that back so I can continue to rest and recover, so I've gone from going full tilt to having days on end by myself at home with nothing to do. I found a free therapy group at the most liberal church in my conservative backwards state.  I've never been much of a churchy person and I know this isn't popular on Reddit but that helps me.  I've also joined a book club and picked up a new hobby, quilting, so I go to the ""sew ins"" at the quilt shop almost every day.  

I have tried my best to understand, beautiful, or wanted.  Whenever we did have sex, it was like pulling teeth.  He looked so awfully bored it almost killed off my sex drive completely right then and there.  It never happens, on the rare occasions when it does it's awful.  I've tried so hard to make up any deficiencies on my part.  I didn't think living with a husband would be like living with a roommate.  It looks like it doesn't even bother him.  He tells me I'm beautiful.  I don't believe him.  

This drastic change didn't really start until he went on meds for the stroke.  I have already decided that if this truly is a med issue I would rather have him alive and our relationship fine in every other way except a passionless marriage.  But we can't even determine that because he won't go to the doctor, when my IUD has to be replaced in two years, just telling the gyno ""Don't bother replacing it.  There's no point.""

I've been lurking for a whole 12 hours

I'm in my late 30s. My wife and I have been married 10+ years. About 6-7 years ago, obviously because she was getting sick. The surgery went fine, no complications, but sex was painful for years afterward, when it even happened.

Meanwhile, it seemed like the right thing to do. 

My wife can't have hormone replacement, and she dropped it. No change in her sex drive so far.

Anyway, amazing, adopted child's home, but don't know what to do. I don't think I can do this for more than another year. Even that seems impossible right now.

Kisses are quick, very loving toward me emotionally and verbally. It definitely frustrates her that she can't ""just do it"" like we used to. 

Our relationship is, get along very well as best friends, live together and share most of our time together. We've had ""The Talk"" a couple times, and she's clearly frustrated with her lack of sexual interest, but she just can't will it back into existence. She tried going off her birth control pills, but it didn't seem to help. The pressure of ""is something going to happen?"" and the stress of it all was probably enough to negate any libido that going off the pills may have returned. The stress of the whole situation in a way makes a DB perpetuate itself.

It's been a bit of a silver lining that we've gotten better at communicating through all this. Our talks have gotten more constructive and affirmed in communication our love for each other that has been lost physically. 

The reason I'm posting today

It's to share a little success and give a little bit of hope to those of you who (along with your partners) are willing to try and keep things going in a relationship full of love

Last week, you may understand how much of a step in the right direction it really is.

It starts with no sexual touching being allowed. Although it's just a beginning to a road back to (hopefully) sex

I've been trying to let go of the need to keep my partner's attention on me and trying to stop feeling threatened by pornography as well. Recently

As a result, I was too scared that he would go masturbate to porn if I turned him down when *he* wanted it. I'm trying to teach myself to cope with those feelings and realize that he's not going to leave me because I don't look like the girl from the porn he just watched. 

His initial confusion and annoyance at being turned down actually made me feel proud. I felt like he needed to understand how it feels because it was literally the first time it had EVER happened to him. The more I consider that

Finally, it was a heavy, crampy period day, so we ended up just pleasing him. It went well on his end and I was glad that maybe our sex life might return again.  

But no. Nothing since then. Today

Now, but instead of it. This was just the last straw. I really don't want to make any effort anymore and obviously he doesn't, either. We had spent the entire morning together and I obviously would've had sex with him.

1342034944.0,wef5s,No one ever validated my need for more intimacy till recently,bbgnot,16,1,37,"No one ever validated my need for more intimacy till recently.  

I ( 35/m) am 10 years married to my wife (35/f).  We have a 1.5 year old son. 

I grew up a cafeteria Catholic in a pretty worldly/liberal household.  She grew up in a devout Catholic very conservative household.  We started dating in college and married 2.5 years later after we both graduated.  We did not have vaginal intercourse before marriage but engaged in other activities frequently and mutually enjoyable.  The about 6 months before we married Catholic guilt caught up with my wife and she asked if we could wait on any sexual activities for marriage and I agreed.  

Once married we tried to start things back up but she was having pain during intercourse (she blames my size which is larger than average but not to porn star proportions).  She also had a very severe bout with IBS and general anxiety during which time she went off birth control and we stopped having sexual contact for ~ 9 months.  Once we restarted our sexual relationship things went from 3x/ month for the first couple months down to about once every two months.  I would prefer 2-3x per week.  When I would try to discuss our sexual relationship she was insistent that we had it often enough and that we were the same as most couples.  

At some point she asked to eliminate oral sex from our repertoire.  She has a strong aversion to most smells and did not like her own or mine (I am clean and well groomed and from my small experience she has a similar scent level to most women).  In this past this was an activity that seemed mutually pleasurable and she would frequently have orgasms.  I didn’t feel like I had any choice in the matter and conceded.    

I have never felt that my need for a more frequent and enthusiastic sex life was valid until reading Sex Starved Marriage and related material on the internet.  I have asked my wife to read it and is making slow reading progress but our bedroom is still on life support.  I certainly appreciate hearing that we are not alone.

For most of our marriage I would fantasize about my wife, but the nuts and bolts of dividing assets, custody, moving to a new home, and so on.  I truly don’t want a divorce if only for my son’s sake.  I love my wife.  I find her intelligent, thoughtful in every other way, a good mother

To preempt the standard suggestions I am physically fit, propose going on dates (she is not as interested now that we have a son), do my share or more of the household chores, moved to live closer to her family with a longer commute for me, and make sure that she has time for herself and her friends.

Summary and things left out
We have been married 10 years with a 1.5 year old son.  Outwardly model nuclear family.  Internally suffering because of DB and me becoming bitter.
She has low libido, Catholic guilt, and still has pain with intercourse.
I have higher libido, don’t know how to make my wife happy/want me.
I would like 2-3x/week with some enthusiasm.  Current and for marjority of the last 9 years 1x/2 months where she would like it to end as quickly as possible.  She rarely initiates.  

Thank you for any suggestion.  As the partner with higher libido did you ever stop wanting your spouse?  Did you ever recover those feelings?

I flat out asked him if he wanted to cuddle with me or if he wanted me to masturbate after he left.  He chose to cuddle with me. Tuesday I sent him a picture of my breast. He came in the room, and left.

We are both in our early 20's. We dated for 2+ years before deciding to get married. Due to religious background and some of our friends experiencing accident pregnancies

Honeymoon was the usual clumsiness of being new to sex and trying different things, it got worse still. At about 6 weeks post honeymoon we started to click again and had the best sex yet. At least twice, my wife let me know by interrupting our conversation that “sex was awesome last night”. The getting better phase lasted another month. I thought we were making some good progress since I was  starting to figure out what my wife liked. It was great seeing my wife satisfied, or at least enjoying sex.

After about 3 months, before bed.  Oral sex both ways is off the table since it's “gross” or “disgusting”. Hell, I actually don't mind and used to enjoy going down on my wife, but now it's off limits. My hands are  covered in bacteria, so touching is kept to the absolute minimum. Sex itself is all about avoiding pain. A lack of pain is pretty rare. Even a slight movement inside can cause her to recoil. As soon as I'm finished, I'm pushed outside. I've tried to find out what my wife likes, what gets her going but it's as if there is a mental block to responding to any advance that I offer. I can see her get goosebumps and get aroused, she rarely responds by kissing me back. Not once have I made a negative comment about her body, hand holding without pressuring her for sex seem to have no effect her comfort level. As far as I know

There are days when even a simple touch on the shoulder gets her pissed off. Those are particularly bad, the cold fish response during and just plain feeling like shit after.

35 Male here, but of course the one which is why I'm posting here.

I literally hit the relationship jackpot with this woman. We have known each other since gradeschool and have seen each other go through many different relationships. Even at one time

Fast forward a few years and both of us are unattached after parting ways with our significant other. We hang out constantly. Not dating but doing stuff without the commitment of saying this is my boy/girl friend. Many people around us say that we are dating

This woman is the person that I wanted to be with

Now we both have our hangups. I over-estimate myself while she does the complete opposite. I'm confident that I can do anything and put myself into difficult situations. She doesn't have faith in herself and avoids uncomfortable situations at all cost. Opposites attract maybe? But recently the anxiety of our lack of intimacy has her taking the stance of: ""I don't want to talk about it"". This has been the standard answer about any type of sexual contact for years now and it has been getting progressively worse with each passing year. 

She had issues with physical contact that I was unaware, someone suggested getting *The Sex-Starved Marriage.* She read about 30 pages of it, and it has sat under our bed on the same page for the last 7 months. 

I tried going to therapy for myself. She said it upset her because she was already seeing a therapist and to ask her to take on yet another appointment was just too much. After a session or two

Almost done, does quite a bit that I think sometimes she doesn't feel appreciated for it.

*So here it comes* We don't touch each other anymore

In the past I've had rants about this that are a lot more derogatory than this post and to be honest more spiteful. But I need to look at this now with a clearer head. I've come to resent her for this. I've tried books. Therapy. Waiting her out. Going hardcore alpha. Doing much more around the house. Trying to reduce her stress. Giving her alone time as she said she wants. Being romantic. Being aloof. I don't know anymore. I don't want to spend my life feeling like I am forcing the person I'm with to put a hand on me. I don't mean sex per se. I mean someone who is comfortable just with touching me. I have begun to feel like I am some deviant because I yearn for *some kind* of physical contact. 

**To the Question: If you could tell/show your significant other anything about how you feel right now

For me: I've seen too many types of porn and too much of it trying to substitute that feeling that you once gave me. Nothing works anymore. The feeling is hollow when the deed is done. I feel awkward sleeping beside you anymore. I don't want to lose my kids, but it doesn't matter. You'll find another reason why you can't or won't. 

TL:DR - Another guy(35), no sex. The same story as every other post.

I'm worried that I'm in too deep here and the request is fairly unreasonable at this point.  I've clearly made a mistake and her financial dependence on me has only amplified my resentment.

She knows what I've wanted for a long time and has either purposefully or passively withheld it.  I've given her all that I have.  I'm done initiating conversations about this and she hasn't said one word about it since she joined me here.  It's eating me alive and I'm unhappy.

So the other night my SO of 10 years kind of vented at me over our lacking sex lives. It's true and I can't really argue: in the earlier part of our relationship we had sex every 1-2 nights, and I like to cuddle up with her on the couch at night, I just have very little sexual desire. Also this isn't a problem with no longer feeling that she is attractive: I don't fantasize about other women, and I very rarely masterbate. I just don't feel that drive.

I honestly think my problem is born out of my occupation: I am a doctor in a field involving the female anatomy.

There is a definitive aura eminating from both my parents that affects everyone around them.

Now, I don't know the details, nor do I want to, but this needs to be fixed. Yesterday before I left, I dropped a note where my dad would find it later giving him the name of a few websites to check out, so I'm hoping that helps the situation.

Girlfriend is also in her thirties.  Never married.

Our relationship is almost two years old.  We are both responsible adults

As the story goes, there were signs I should have seen which I should have known would lead, inexorably, here:

Though our bedroom is not yet dead, but I want no part of it.  

Sex, not giving a shred of concern to her own.  As a consequence, she cannot obtain orgasm at anything less than 3000 rpm (toys) and derives virtually no pleasure from penetrative sex.

She does not enjoy oral sex (giving or receiving due to jaw pain[giving] and extreme ticklishness[receiving]).  

She has a very hard time getting wet

She claims that I am the biggest she has had

She has also admitted that she is rarely horny.  Though she is the prime initiator

Though this situation might seem ideal when held against some of the other stories I've seen on this subreddit (""I've never had sex with my wife of 7 years"" What the actual fuck?) and maybe this would be better if posted in r/sex

The characteristics I listed above, if you couldn't get them off, then you'd better lie down and prepare for the ride of your life because you're not going anywhere until you get that pussy off!

But

That last part, disregarding her own and taking what is my right as man (not something I don't believe, btw though I have characterized it in that way to her when framing our situation during conversation).

But I cannot be content with this arrangement.  The greatest pleasure that I can derive for myself is the knowledge that I can please my partner.  That we can share in a union of bodies that will result in earth-shattering mutual satisfaction.  I cannot abide sex so stagnant in passion and physicality that a sweat won't even be broken

I just got out of a two year relationship (21F), yes I know many of you would kill for that, but then I didn't tell you to stay in yours). 

More relevantly, so it clearly wasn't a bait-and-switch tactic. She had literally lost count of the number of ppl she'd been with in the year before me, but was guessing high 60s. As someone who thinks one of the world's biggest problems is that women are taught not to admit they like sex, this was obviously fine with me. It almost doesn't get any H-er L than this. Seems like a ""stay out of DB free"" card, no? 

NO IT ISN'T. To bring it back to my title question, I have always thought of marriage as something you only do when you're completely done being single and you've exhaustively appreciated every pro and con of staying that way, because marital mismatch is a friggin pandemic. If ever at all. I feel like unconsciously, all my romantic behavior works toward avoiding a marital DB and being my parents 2.0. But if even nymphoids like my ex lose steam in two years... ""if ever at all""...

**First stab at an answer to my own question**

You can't avoid marital DBs because there are no warning signs, potentially devastating contract one ever enters, while idiotically being also the contract with the fewest terms spelled out and agreed upon. Combine these two and the only answer is to spell out that one, extra-special term before you marry. 

From what I've read on this forum, spoken premarital agreements people make every day (how many kids, old mom has to move in, etc.). It wouldn't necessarily prevent DBs, but what it certainly would do is move LLs from probable to definite moral high ground and end some unnecessary self-hate and dithering. ""Am I to blame that we're not having regular sex? No, she agreed to it."" ""Am I being a dick for being pushy with him about it? No, he agreed to it."" ""Am I perverted or wrong to expect more? Absolutely not."" ""Should I feel guilty for wanting to break up/see other people? He compromised our relationship, desire and resentment both pre-validated, because SO agreed to not let this happen. 

I'm not pushing an ""I vow to bang you exactly 3X+/wk"" approach. More something like ""Sex says 'I love you' in a way that's even more important than saying 'I love you'

I doubted these preferences mattered since he choose and loved me. But now I can't help but feel that my race is contributing to the DB.

I have started feeling uncomfortable being naked or scantly clad in front of him.. because now it feels like I am trying too hard to make him notice me sexually, and as he looked at me disgusted and told me to move out of his way I became extremely self conscious of my body. I just wanted to cover it up and hide. He says it's not me and tells me that I am attractive but I can't seem to get him aroused. He does masterbate and has told me that he never had this experience with his previous gfs, which leaves me feeling like it IS me. I really don't know what to do.

It's common for those of us affected by a dead bedroom to feel like we don't deserve these things. I've written about this before in more detail ([example](http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/19ijqg/305_am/c8oe8gg)).

I struggle with internalizing this. I struggle with it all the time, long before my marriage even. I almost never feel like I deserve the intimacy I get or that I crave. In case that wasn't clear: my dead bedroom was not the sole cause of this - I've never been the most confident guy when it comes to sex and sexuality - but it definitely exacerbated these feelings.

I discussed this in therapy some a while ago. It was something I never got very far with. I was asked how I feel when I'm having sexual contact. My response was ""lucky"". I've always said that, ""lucky"" was also this subtle insult aimed at myself. That is to say, I didn't deserve it, but *luckily*, I somehow got it anyway. I could instead say that it makes me feel special, or loved, or cherished

I believe these feelings of non-deserving were the reason I did not really consider leaving my marriage, no shared property). I had lots of thoughts like:

* Some people have an exciting sexual life
* I should work on trying to help other people and less about myself
* This is just the way life is meant to be for me
* I am happier being together with my wife

And so I kept myself in a situation that could very well have perpetuated itself for so much longer than it did. I don't know what to think of these feelings of inadequacy. They have caused me a lot of grief, to keeping my marriage going during our most difficult times. I'm very conflicted about this, but I ultimately think they are unhealthy for me, even if they serendipitous-ly(?) helped my wife and I get to where we are now in our marriage (along with a lot of effort, support, therapy, improved communication

The main way I know to try and make progress with reversing these kind of negative though patterns is to work on recognizing them consciously when they do occur, and it has helped my wife remove some of her negative associations of sexual encounters, whether anxiety or shame.

Recently, I don't deserve to feel *this* good"". Again, an insult wrapped in a tidy little mask of a compliment. How sneaky I am! Luckily, this time I noticed it almost right away, and somehow that was enough to let go for a bit and enjoy what was happening in the present moment. I hope to be able to do that more in the future.

His explanation was that he has never been able to pick up on subtle hints or body language, having the opposite effect. I guess when I think back, he has usually been on the passive side. I was the one who made the first move on him and it was pretty direct (not much in the way of flirting, just sat on his lap). 

I asked him **when** was a good time to reach for his cock

I also asked him jokingly why he didn't grope my ass anymore

We didn't get further than some cuddling and groping last night (it was bedtime for him) buuut I decided to put this ""just touch the cock"" thing to the test tonight. He went to go read in bed before he had to go to sleep. I came in a few minutes later, sure enough, it woke up. So then I decided to go to town on his cock with a blowjob, something I had been thinking about all evening.

So. There's still some other things we need to work out, because I hate flirting and coy bullshit, and I am terrible at it. We'll see how this progresses.

I only recently had a discussion with him regarding the matter. His conclusion on the situation was, ""You always want to have sex after I get off work, which is when I feel the most exhausted."" I attempted to explain that he starts his day at 5:30AM, and it's been made clear that waking him up shortly before that to have sex isn't an option. He'd rather sleep. So that leaves us with strictly the weekends, but he uses the same excuses. ""I would rather just relax and watch TV on the weekends"", ""I need to take a nap so I'm rested for the work week"", etc. I feel as if he treats it like a chore

One issue that I suspect is part of the problem is his sleep apnea. He never knew that he had it, and that the real problem is that he needs to lose weight, which he'd rather do. Problem is, he's not losing the weight, so he needs to do the CPAP for now. He truly seems constantly exhausted and tired, and always has, so I believe that treating this really might help the situation. But he won't make an attempt at dealing with it

What I don't want to believe is that the problem runs deeper, he still won't be interested in sex. Unfortunately, I'm starting to believe that's the case. If the thought of us having a healthier sex life appealed to him, I feel as if he'd put effort into that goal. Instead, I just get every excuse in the book. 

A little more about me. I am 21, and when is a good time to leave. I love him immensely, and the thought of him being saddened by a break up kills me. But our lack of sex manifests itself in all aspects of our relationship, and I very seldom feel any sort of affection in any form from him.

1359584771.0,17l7pk,On Talking to Men,talkingpointes,32,17,23,"Men are dumb. Actually this isn’t true

Remember the last time he said he wanted to have sex with you, and he’s rationally aware that you want more (better, harder) of it, he will agree to pretty much anything. In his mind, later can be dealt with later. Your husband will promise you sex to make you happy. And it works too, at least for a while: you get that little bubble rush of excited anticipation inside you, and you show it. He sees this and realizes he’s made the right choice. When your husband is presented with a choice of two outcomes, and one in which you are unhappy right now, especially if you are part of the reason. He takes the rationally easy route to avoid making you emotional. The key point: he is promising sex later to make you happy

So that explains why he agrees in the first place, **he doesn’t want to**. That might sting a little to hear, but it may not even have much to do with you. This is when his own lack of sexual desire comes face to face with his need to keep you happy.  We could make a list of reasons why a man might have a reduced libido, but it will be long, diverse, and not really relevant to this topic. (We’ll tackle it later.)

Whatever his personal issues may be

Men are dumb. When we see you get emotional because of something we said, dispel it, even fight it. The truth is we don’t really know how to deal with it. The best way for you to overcome our slight mental deficiency is to *be blunt and minimally emotional* when you have something important to tell us. If you are blunt then we are unlikely to be able to misinterpret your intentions. If you are keeping your emotions under wraps then we won’t feel like you could get upset at any moment. We have no problem participating in a rational surface conversation. 

The final critical component is real consequences. Not only are we dumb, but then you keep living the rest of your life as normal, you’re not giving him a good enough reason to change. Since he is considering this rationally, he sees change as difficult (it is), and he sees little repercussions for continuing the status quo. (Aside: these are not conscious decisions.) Yes, he does want to make you happy, but you only really seem unhappy when the topic of sex comes up. So when sex comes up he will quickly assure you that it will happen soon. If he is forced into sex it is likely plain and ends quickly. It’s a simple pattern, you’re part of the problem because you are not acknowledging how motivation truly works.

So how does this apply itself to real life? Good question. If you are having occasional mediocre sex, because then he will rationally file it away as ‘good enough, she’s happy!’. If you are not having much sex at all, have another talk with him about it. Here’s the golden rule: **do not lose your cool, whether it’s getting angry or crying**. As soon as your emotions show up his main concern will be addressing them immediately, and he will lose focus of the longer goal. Tell him exactly what you want, when you want it, but he will listen. Tell him (coldly) that he needs to figure it out, it might develop between me and someone else’, and choose a consequence that is both *concrete* and *realistic*. 

**tl;dr:** Men are dumb and lazy. Women: If you want change you must be blunt, you can’t fix him, so make it clear that you think it's a priority for him to self-examine. Support him if he decides to try.

As always, what do you have to lose? No really, start by thinking about what you’re willing to lose to get that intimate connection with your man. That is your consequence. If you are willing to lose everything, you might have a chance. Thanks for reading! Until next time.

Ok, but that the reasons we love eachother will never change. The past year has changed us immensely, and we love eachother a million times more than when we married. All is well.

Except our sex is broken. We have talked SO much about this, because I have plenty of that shit. It's frustrating. We have sex for like 10 minutes about once a week. I have some ideas of why this is happening, but as we try to fix it, nothing has changed. He is satisfied, so it just isn't going anywhere. He has a habit of finishing quickly, and going to bed. Since we've talked about this, he has tried finishing me off by hand after. This is a turnoff for me, because oral is my favorite.

Here's the worst- I have subconsciously taken my desires elsewhere. I now have a huge thing for his best friend, this is way bigger than anyone knows. I don't have the reigns on this anymore. If we had sex, I know it would be amazing, because I am incredibly attracted to him in every way possible. It kills me. If he touched me, my fidelity would be over.

My husband and I met on a BDSM website. I was very involved in the local scene where I was from, by chance, ended up visiting his city on vacation with a friend of mine 6 months later. We immediately hit it off, and had an awesome time together. 

Fast forward 4 months and I actually packed up and moved to be with him. I knew I was taking a chance, some family things he had going on, etc. 

To be honest, but yet doesn't want to try to make it better. 

We ended up getting married about a year ago. Anyone I have ever explained our sex life to (Kinky or not) has said ""I cannot believe you didn't leave"". I can't believe I didn't leave. Adding to the complication, etc.) All of these times have been extremely uneventful and not satisfying to me in the least. The irritating thing too... is that right before I found out I was pregnant, I told him I didn't want to try anymore because I was SO frustrated that he never wanted to have sex and I was so, so angry. I honestly don't even know how we managed to get pregnant.

Sex aside, rubbing me, snuggling, etc. and is an amazing husband. He takes care of me, makes me feel safe and secure... and would do anything I ask. I am tired of the tears and frustration... tired of crying myself to sleep. Tired of endless conversations with him (I am communicative- I don't expect him to be a mind reader!) Tired of being excited for the RARE opportunities (once a month or so?) where I am home alone and can satisfy myself sexually. 

I feel like what I have tried to do is push my sexuality aside... realize how lucky I am that everything else is so great. We really have a wonderful life together. I hoped that my fire and passion as a sexually submissive person would go away. It just doesn't... and now I am angry that I feel like I have to keep this part of me to myself.

A little background, been in relationship for almost 7 of those years. When we first started dating, being in a country where its normal to live with your parents, we didn't have a place to get intimate etc. He never talks about sex. From the very first day. at all. we did not do the deed till 5 years into the relationship when we moved to a different country for our further studies. for the first 5 years, we would not even kiss everyday or get to hug each other because we wouldn't have a place to. once in a month or may be two, his parents or mine would go out of town and we would have the place to ourselves and still it was all under the t-shirt action, nothing below the belt. When I would ask him why this was, I got my own place which I shared with my roommates but I could still get the place to myself more often. still, not even talk about it. He would show up without them, right? It just started feeling more and more like i wanted it and he didn't. If i ask him

An entire almost went by, I asked him to get the condoms and again, he shows up on the trip without any. We go buy some and we start the deed. we do it and it was okay. the first couple of times, we struggled because I would be dry and he didn't know any better because we were both virgins. If the first weekend you have with each other after such a long time and you just start having sex, you should be all over each other and not leave the room right? But, nothing such happened. We did it twice. very awkwardly. After coming back from there, I moved in with him and his roommates. I started sharing a room with him. Still the sex would be once a week or sometimes once in two weeks. It's almost as if I am the one who initiates it every time. I keep asking if he is not attracted to me anymore as I had put on weight, working out, on the other hand, found out that it's normal. So I suggested that he does some fingering first

Apart from the sex life, but in a childish manner most of the time. I am really stuck here. I don't know what to do or how to make this better. It feels as if He is really shy and when I try to make him more comfortable by trying to be naked around him more, or ask him to take showers with me. But nothing. Everytime we have sex, he finishes, asks me if I have come, when I say I didn't, and that he could help me finish, talk things out but he just shuts himself up. He has never raised any questions about our sex life. i am the only one who brings it up. I feel selfish trying to complain about this and slowly started getting content about once a week sex or once in two weeks but I still need to talk about it. He doesn't hug much, but the kiss becomes awkward and this slowly just turns me off. I feel like I am putting a lot of efforts but to no avail. and this is making me lose hope day by day and I fear it will drive me away from him. Is 7 years too long for someone to open up to you? 

May be, it would be really helpful. I really need some perspective here as i am not able to talk about this with anyone. I would really appreciate any advice.   ",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,

I'm extremely HL, but I couldn't remember a thing and I was told it didn't get anywhere.

No such luck, nerves got the best of me AND I knew he was tired so I attached some guilt right on it.

I suppose now would be the time to mention that I ONLY get sexytimes chances twice a week on his weekend days

Unlike many of you here my partner wants a higher libido, I'm spinning in a circle of perpetual failure.

Feels better getting this off my chest but I still don't know what the fuck to do. I'm so mad at myself for not being able to go for it, or break something. But instead I lay here. Confessing all of this to however many random individuals on the internet, with less than half battery life, still wide awake and unable to sleep. Bitter that work starts for him again later today (he's a cna and is always tired after work, which makes me feel guilty for even thinking of bothering him, though he insists its not bothersome at all).

We're both 26 and have been together 3.5 years, maybe) and I started to feel a lot of pressure from him. He's horny basically all the time and would be perfectly fine having sex 4-5 times a day. At my highest libido I was fine with once a day/several times a week. He also tends to beg or get frustrated when I say no. We couldn't snuggle or sit on a couch or bed together without him trying something or begging for a blow job. 

Then I suffered a series of blood clots as a side effect from the birth control pills and had to immediately stop taking them. It took more than a year to get my hormones back in check and feel more or less normal. In August I found out I was pregnant and then suffered a miscarriage. So yeah it's been a hell of a two years for me.

I think we've been making progress dealing with our issues over the past few months and we went from having sex maybe once a month to several times a week. We had a talk about it tonight. He feels like shit because he's horny all the time and hates himself for begging. He also seems to think he should somehow try to make himself less horny and I'm not even sure what that means. I feel like shit because I feel like it's my fault. I've really been making an effort to have sex more often and I don't mean just for his sake but I've really been making an effort to get in the mood

There have been, or I'll flat out say, hey, how about a nice romantic evening tonight.  I'll usually say this at the beginning of the week, and each night I hear ""How about tomorrow"".  When Thursday or Friday rolls around, an argument ensues due to again having to wait.

Not to long ago my wife told me she said ""I've noticed you're trying harder at this relationship"".  I was happy to have her notice.

This past week, tomorrow"".  Thursday, she gets home after a dinner out with family.  She's talking, and I'm cuddling with her.  She then looks at me, and says ""I'm not comfortable with this""  ""Not now"" ""etc"".

I'm beyond pissed at this point.  Three days of delaying sex, I'm angry, I'm confused, all in one.  

She said she expects certain things, I got that.  Thats why I have tried a lot harder to make her feel good about herself.  She said she noticed!  She even mentioned that she noticed how hard I was trying.  I was trying hard?  Yet that's not good enough?  What must I do?  

I tell her that she's complained about the frequency of our sex life.  Well hell, in a past argument about her concern about not enough sex.  She rarely initiates, its usually all on me to initiate.  I've gotten to the point where I don't want to initiate, because I know I'll get rejected, shot down.

I'm crying.  I feel helpless.  I hear her pleas

I'm now depressed.  I'm confused about all of this, so it saddens me that I feel like I'm putting 100% of the effort in now to repair it.  It depresses me.  I'd like more sex, twice a week plus some oral once in a while would be awesome.  I have to settle on once a month now, which appears to be the average.  If she wants me to put more effort now into it now than I already am, will that get me the amount of physical affection I'm looking for?  I'm not sure what to do.  I'm angry too because of the promises I'm being made saying ""It'll happen tomorrow"" and the obvious happens where it doesn't.

My wife(f29) and I (m32) have been together for nearly 8 years.  We got married 3 years ago. We have a 2 year old son. He's the light of my life and she comes in a close second. For most of the time we've been together

She's the sort of quirky out of the box girl with a lot of energy and really smart wit.  I'm more of the Hank Hill middle of the road type of guy, socially awkward, prefer evenings in, but I'm generally the nicest guy you'll meet. I always make sure those around me are happy, and that's always my number one concern. 

For the past year or so

She has had some serious depression for the past year, this makes it pretty hard to try to put the moves on someone you are in love with, and its hard to come to terms with the idea that she probably thinks its ""blegh"" to be advanced on by me.   I've been Hitting the gym, and trying to be super awesome with her, but the results just seem like she's tolerating me. 


Before we were together, I know, but she decided to settle down with me.  I had some weird thoughts about that at first, but I got through it.  

I've come to the conclusion that she misses how she used to be. Not necessarily being promiscuous

By no means do I put her on a leash. In fact, I stay back and she goes out.  We rarely ever go out together, and when we do we have almost nothing to talk about with each other.  And just end up shooting the shit and being funny, but like normal friends would and not a couple. 

Anyway, or at the very least, no ""thanks"" or even acknowledgement that I was being nice.   Sometimes I linger around just to try to make a point that she should thank me. And it doesn't work half the time. 

She seems to be in such a bad mood all the time that she can't see the nice things anymore.  I know her bad mood is only caused by our relationship

Anyway

We were out to dinner tonight, he hit some other buttons and exited out of the game he was playing and got fed up.  I grabbed to phone to get it back on the game and noticed it was opened to an SMS conversation with a guy friend of hers. Someone we were both friends with in the city we used to live in a year ago,  halfway across the country. 

The gist of what I saw, and not just because of the ""awesome cuddles"" but because of their interactions and how well they mesh together.  I had just sent her on a mini vacation to visit some friends in our old home-town.  It was a surprise gift for our 3 year anniversary. And one of those friends told me that instead of staying the night at their place, she crashed at his place.  She had originally said they all crashed there together, but then pretended I didn't hear it right when she said that, and that they just hung out. I pretty much called her on it and she swore up and down that she's been an absolute saint and would never cheat on me. 

Personally, per-say, but the ""awesome cuddles"" comment, along with the boner talk and the profession of love are pretty much horrible to find.  I had so much adrenaline and shock pumping through my veins when I read it, I hardly knew what to do. I gave the phone back to our son, and kept quiet at dinner. Trying to be nice as if I didn't know.  I didn't want a huge argument in public, and when we got home I just didn't know what to do.  I stayed out in the garage

The thought of tearing up my family is making me ill. I couldn't stand the thought of not being around them, and can't be there whenever I want. To be alone in some cheap apartment with no one around, left to silence. Even typing that out has me nearly in tears.  I've had reoccurring nightmares about the situation and I wake up in shambles. 

I'm not sure what to do next here. I know this sort of behavior should be unacceptable.  That I should just start filing for divorce and not look back. But I really want to make this work. My wife has been the best thing to ever come into my life

I know this isn't a strictly dead-bedroom scenario

What the hell am I supposed to do here? I don't want to be the one to initiate the horrible action. I can't be the fault here. Everyone would just blame me for not making it work and taking the ""easy way out"" by not working through it. 

I have discussed counseling with her and her response 2 months ago was ""it is what it is.... I don't think it's worth the trouble

I'm just really left with no idea of how to move forward. I would be a husk of a man at the end of a divorce in this scenario. The 2 things in my life that keep me going everyday stripped away from me in a very permanent way.  Yes, I want to be around him every day, to follow our routine and teach him all the cool things he needs to know.  Being a father has given me so much reason in this world.

When we started dating it was great, we once discussed how long we've gone without sex since our first time. Me: 1 year Her: 4 months. It has now been 5 months since we last had sex with only 3 sessions of foreplay leading to her being satisfied. Her record is broken I suppose. 

Before we were together I had 2 other partners and things were so so. I actually had a similar problem with an ex and broke it off because I was not happy. But now I am extremely happy in every way but this. She has had a pretty exciting sex life before me with 5 partners and some curious fetishes. We have never done any of them despite my attempts. 

When we talk about sex she always says how good it is and sounds like she loves it. Her actions say otherwise because when I attempt any move I am instantly rejected. If I try a long kiss she backs out after 1 second. I tried the 10 second kiss idea and she said I can't force that. If I try to feel her up she just says ""What do you think you're doing?"" or ""And what do YOU want?"" (playfully

About a month ago we tried mojoupgrade and really had fun doing it. We learned a lot and it got us talking...and that's all. The only time anything ever happens is when we've been drinking and she gets really into it and says she loves it. The last time we fooled around we almost had sex but it turned out she is too tight for me now. I suggested that we have fun to fix this

So I'm about to have the talk

We actually want to have sex.  It's just not working for whatever reason.

So

This is the same thing that schools use to promote positive behavior and extinguish unwanted behaviors.  This is a ""proven"" method to shape behavior.

So-I have literally made ""masterbucks"" featuring ""Uschlickes S. Grant"" and ""Thomas Jerkofferson"".

Working together last night we made a list of things we can do to earn our ""masterbucks"".

-sex
-foreplay
-15 minutes of cleaning (it needs to get done-let's reward ourselves!)
-15 minutes of laundry/dishes
-activities done together (dog park, cooking, dinner, etc)
-date night


Things we can spend our ""masterbucks"" on:

-oral sex
-pick a position
-pick a location
-tie up
-talk dirty
-sex toy of choice
-act out a fantasy
-sex outfit
-masturbation 

With this masturbation is allowed

I'm printing the coupons on two colors (mine/his) and that way we can buy coupons towards either person.  So

It's kinda fun

I am a 29 year old female. 
Unfortunately I have a very long history of sexual abuse. My stepfather was abusive towards me for a period of many many years (rape and other sexual abuse, I turned out basically as well as anyone could hope having gone through that. 

My husband is 30, insisted on us marrying the moment I arrived here, so that I could not tempt him to have sex with me and lead him straight towards hell. We were married within a week of me arriving.  

We had sex in the first few months, or really awkward. But it trailed off really quickly. 

His 3 younger brothers lived with us for the first 5 years of our marriage. For me this was a major issue

I think at this point we haven't had sex in about 4 years. 

I'd like to fix it. 

Sometimes  I have flashbacks during sex which are pretty crippling and sometimes the after-effects of that can last days. And I know this makes him anxious, or even the majority of the time. But they are unpredictable. 

He has never been with anyone but me. He is also quite anxious about sex

May of last year we finally got rid of the last of his brothers. Our relationship has improved a million times since then. Honestly he is absolutely amazing and he has dealt with the lack of sex like a complete champ. I couldn't ask for more in a husband. 

I'd like for us to be having sex. Or at least trying. But I don't know how to bring it up. After 4 years it's so easy to just not. 

I know the obvious answer is simply ""Just go jump him"" or 'talk to him about it'. We've never been great at talking about it. And I'm worried that if we do try having sex

My boyfriend (27) and I (f/26) have been together almost 2 years. I've known he has a low libido from the start

I miss him while he's gone and am always excited to see him so we can talk face-to-face and so I can be physically close to him (cuddle, but the fact that sex with me doesn't even cross his mind when he hasn't seen me in 7 days and won't see me for another 7 days really.fucking.hurts.

I got upset this morning after no sex. We've discussed this before and I've been pretty honest about my needs and feelings, but I'm at my breaking point. 
  
  
  
These are some ways he's responded to this situation:
-He feels like a piece of meat
-Asks why spending a whole night talking and cuddling isn't good enough for me
-He's tired/stressed from work, he LEAVES almost every weekend to go skiing or fishing, so yeah, that weeknight is our only opportunity and he knows it)
-He likes sex in the morning (except sex in the morning has started happening less and less and less)
-Says he gets horny at certain times and those are usually times I'm not around
-He does watch porn, but I have wondered if he's said that so I don't think he's just totally asexual all the time) 
-He feels inadequate as a man that he can't keep up with me and might lose the relationship because of it
  
  
As much as it breaks my heart, I am willing to talk about it to try to make him understand and give him one more chance because I haven't been perfect either. When do talk about it, he says he feels inadequate. I know I might've been harsh at times instead of more understanding/non-judgmental, but it's only because I've felt so hurt and rejected. I realize it's counter-productive and I don't want to hurt his self-esteem. I have verbalized many times how it's all about my wanting to feel close and connected to him. I want to have sex with HIM, not just have sex to feel physically satiated. 

TL;DR: 
Question #1: Boyfriend has a low libido and doesn't understand why it hurts me so much that he never initiates. How do I explain to him why it's important to me and why it's not just about ""getting off""? I need help putting it into words.

Question #2: How do I initiate? I used to initiate a lot more and I almost never now because my self-esteem has taken a hit and I don't want to get rejected again.

My girlfriend and I are both in our mid-to-late 30s

But recently I'd been getting really close to wanting to break up.  Over the past 5 or so years, and not all that frequent, but still good.  She is a bit of a workaholic with a generally low libido, not terribly experimental, and I'm not a very take-charge kind of guy.

I've always had trouble because I take too long, but it hurts her) and we've never really been able to talk very openly about sexual matters - I don't think it's because she's embarrassed, she just isn't that into the idea of discussing new stuff.  Her attitude's always been ""don't talk, just do"" and despite our long time together, despite the fact that I'm generally pretty self-confident I'm pretty insecure about asking her to try things, it's just who I am, so that's already a bit of a weird combination

So about 2 years ago, and switched her to a new kind of lower-hormone pill and medication, which started clearing it up a bit, but we still couldn't have sex, it didn't clear it up.  Recently she'd been turning me down and blowing me off consistently, to the point where I just found myself no longer caring, and she didn't seem to realize how much that was fucking me up - to the point of telling me to just go jerk off one night when I told her I was really horny - and then she just shut down completely.  

The whole thing was exacerbated by the fact that I think I'm a pretty nice, neither a total fat orc nor some glamorous model-man playboy, I know there are probably millions of thing I could do differently or better, but she'd told me a number of times she found me attractive.  I guess there's no accounting for taste.

I'd brought up the topic about lacking sex quite often, I'm increasingly frustrated (and ""performance anxiety"" made it difficult to get what I want from sex anyway, thus causing her frustration because in her eyes I didn't seem to be enjoying myself as she couldn't get me off - and the risk of causing her pain made me very reluctant to ask her to try to do things differently).  I felt bad bringing up the subject of sex, because it felt like I was pressuring her, despite her stressful job and other responsibilities.

A new gynecologist advised her to try a [Mirena](http://www.mirena-us.com/) IUD - she was unsure about it, constant pain, lowered sex drive, the list goes on.  So she got it a few weeks ago - and our sexual interactions went from ""almost nothing"" to ""zero"" nearly overnight.  She was very open about the fact that most women take a few weeks to adapt to it, so I tried to understand, but I found myself manning the flagpole more than usual and becoming increasingly frustrated and feeling rejected.  

I mean, successful woman, I'm not getting any younger, and I don't want to go into monk mode.  This is exacerbated by her always having been open about wanting a child, and me not being really all that ready for it - now that I've reached the point where I see it as ""yeah, sure, why not"" more often than not, then bam

So yesterday morning, I was prepared to just end it, I was that head-fucked.  And lo and behold, she responded and it was some of the best, most intense sex I remember having.  I think I still need to get used to actually having intercourse, so it's time to go ""hands off"" for a few weeks and see if that works, but at least we did something again.

I strongly suspect that hormones from the pill had something to do with it, but her gynecologist had advised her to try different positions, and we found one that appeared to work - I assume the medication and switch to an IUD tremendously helped with the pain, making it go away except in very particular positions.  At least now I know our sexual relationship isn't totally dead, and there's some hint of a hope of light at the end of the tunnel.  I told her how awesome it was and that I'd rarely seen her so into sex.  She also seemed happier and relaxed.

I am currently in a five-year-old relationship( no marriage, offers of cunnilingus, or really any attempts of physical intimacy whatsoever.  On the extremely rare occurrences that she permits me to go down on her, she has to cover her face with a pillow so she can ""concentrate"", and I usually have to agree to a ""no sex guarantee"" such that I don't attempt intercourse when she is finished.  I am 32 years old, and she is 30.

When we first began seeing one another, caressing, showering together, fondling, oral, and penetration in numerous ways, positions, after which it began to peter out to its current level after about a year

I have been able to comprehensively rule out birth control, house orderliness, asexuality, and passivity as possible causes.  What I am left with is a 95% certainty that she doesn't, nor has she ever, found me to be sexually appealing.  I have not gained fat during the course of our relationship, and I have been fairly good about keeping myself in shape.  I earn a good living

Typically, and leave it at that.  Ok, fair enough, but she doesn't even want to *kiss* me with any degree of passion that exceeds a peck on the lips.

 I got real mad and can say I didn't deal with in an emotionally approaite way. I would cry and hold it in. When we'd drink together it would come out in terrible fights. He stopped watching porn(I have no problem with it if you still want to have sex with your partner) who knows how much he masturbates.

Now it's nine months down the road. After many conversations turned into fights. It comes down to him just telling me sex isn't important to him. Hed say to me ""You want to have sex more then once a week?""

I feel like I can't bring it up anymore without it causing a terrible fight and pushing him away. I'm constantly sexually frustrated. Our relationship is perfect in any other way. Hes super loving and cuddly. I love him more then anything in the world.

It seems to me that if I want to stay with him Im stuck with having sex once a week or less. Who knows how it will be when we get older. I don't know what's wrong with us

DAE ever find it difficult to fully enjoy sex when you DO get it, but I know there is a kernel of truth to every joke. I know it's not healthy behaviour to only look to the future all the time, but this isn't really how I am in everyday life. I know I should live in the moment, especially while doing something I enjoy immensely, but I feel like if I let myself fully go to enjoy the experience I'll miss it that much more when he lets me down. Again.

We're only 23 and 27. I feel that he's way too young to never be interested in sex as he claims. I feel it's important to mention that we both have HPV (neither of us is sure who the transmitter was) and he still has genital warts. I told him it doesn't matter to me, he can't be turned on and off like a switch, you're either horny or you're not, I don't feel sexy because of my HPV, I am busy (probably playing a PC game), I don't feel like it right now, or simply just 'no'.

I feel like I'm ranting. I want to go through the entire history of our relationship as much as I want to just make this a short post. I'm just so frustrated. I'm tired of trying to have a conversation with him about what the problem is

I have a boyfriend, funny, gorgeous, and he treats me perfectly. There is only one problem: We don't have sex. Ever.

His past relationships weren't the most healthy, I rarely, if ever, intigate anything. Because of THAT, he's never flirty with me. He never just pins me to a couch and makes out with me, sends me a dirty message... I feel like I get no sexual acknowledgement whatsoever. We do have sex, it's very infrequent and it's good but not great. We've talked about it several times and it always ends up hurting him and I HATE hurting him. Nothing ever changes.

Flash forward to now.

This guy, I know. Pedo-bear). We have a lot in common and I always thought he was cute and we had fun hanging out. We would flirt innocently enough and it was all tame and great. One day, I'm over in his dorm room, we are drinking and play video games and we go to have tipsy cuddles. He ends up kissing me and DAMN that boy knows things a 20 year old should not know. Mike ends up saying that he does have a teensy bit of feelings for me but he wants to keep this strictly a FWB situation because he's always jumped from relationship to relationship and he's going through some major life changes and doesn't want a relationship. I'm thinking, this is awful but fantastic... oh shit. So at the time I just say ""sure"" 'caue I wanted him to keep kissing me.

We meet up a few more times over the days and we eventually go to a party and we're drinking

We arrange to meet up on Sunday to have sex. Again, he got a little weird. The next day I get him to talk about it and he says that since things happened so fast he needed a day to ""process"" what happened. I eventually bluntly asked him ""Do you have feelings for me?"" After a few minutes he responded with ""I think I might if we keep hanging out a lot."" Flattered, and with butterflies in my stomach, I let him be.

He was weird for a few days but today he was back to normal and we hooked up again. This time

I know what I'm doing/did is wrong and I feel like shit about it. The problem is, and really sweet, funny, but he's not the type of person I THINK, as of right now, I would want to end up with. He's a little too irresponsible. Kevin, on the other hand, even though I did these awful things.

I was a late bloomer. Came into my own much later in life, and attractive. By the time I was introduced to the woman who would become my wife, I had only had 2 prior partners: My highschool girlfriend, and an ill-advised hookup with a crush rebounding off her recent ex. When my wife and I first got together, I swear to you we could have fuck-powered a small town's electrical needs for a month. 

And as is often the case, and some it's steep. And mine was the latter. She had body image issues, as she had started to put on a lot of weight. I too had suffered from them, and there was a point where we both went crazy with diets and exercise. We both were turning heads, getting flirty looks at nightclubs, friends who were drunk crossing the line with if-your-significant-other-wasn't-here statements. 

And our sex life was still painfully anemic. Less, how was it that I was so unfuckable to my wife? At the height of feeling like somehow everything just had to change, because maybe if I just worked out a little bit harder or lost a bit more weight, I might be attractive to her again... I proposed, and she said yes. 

I was (and am) nuts about her. But I started starving myself to the point where my body freaked out, it was), and flooded my brain with ""GO EAT NOW"" signals. And I gained all the weight back, and some extra to boot. And only in a matter of a few months. Eventually, we both came to understand that healthy is not a number on a scale or a size on a garment, and we started to accept ourselves and take care of our bodies instead of going to war with them. 

All during this time, where I'd make lots of ""I"" statements, and tried to make a space where she could talk. 

And she just. Would. Not. Do. It. The times we did have sex

Eventually, they were emotional). I was so tired of her being possessive and affectionate when we'd be out at a club, but would instantly plug into her laptop when we got home. I called off the wedding. We went to couples counseling. We felt like we were having breakthroughs, and the wedding was back on, and we got married. 

A few years later, and I asked for a divorce. We almost went through with it, and after one last big blowout where I went through how much she was hurting me and how I felt I had no other choice (because she was hurting me more than I could love her), she finally got it. We reconciled, and our lives went on. 

Things have gotten very incrementally better. We're more comfortable with our bodies, some are sex educators... we are litterally, at this point in our lives, in a sea of sex positive and body positive friends, information, and imagery. But against this backdrop, and as we hit middle age, we have a talk. I'm super-positive, it's still infrequent, like it's getting chores out of the way. 

It's good sex. Fuck, I'm starting to freak out again. She knows it. I've banked my libido for well over a decade, trying to get things to a place that works. I've tried asking her to start from zero, relearning everything that turns us both on, to show each other how we masturbate, to me asking her how she wants sex initiated and what turns her on. Flirting during the day. Asking her to try the mojoupgrade quiz. 

I get shrugs and no answers, she just told me.

My SO and I have been together for almost 6 yrs. Me (M29 HL) Her (27 LL). Like most relationships it started out great in the bedroom. I used to go and visit her before we were living together and she wouldn't let me leave without some sort of sexy time. This was going great for about a year then it started becoming less frequent

After a year or so sex became a fair bit less frequent and I just assumed this was because she still lived with her parents and as her room was right next to theirs it was a bit awkward (mind you it didnt seem to be an issue when we started seeing each other. Oh well).

Eventually about 3 and a half years ago we decided to get our own place and I thought ""Great

We have now lived together for nearly 3 years and I would say that we have sex or anything remotely intimate maybe once every 2-3 months. Which really sucks. 

We have spoken about it and she tells me that she ""doesnt need to have sex and that she doesnt ever feel like it"". So now whenever I try and initiate anything remotely intimate (kisses or hugs even for an extended period) she is quite unresponsive and I get the distinct impression that she thinks that I am pressuring her. I dont know

The few times we have had sex in the last few months has only been because we have been out and she is a little bit tipsy so her inhibitions are a little more relaxed. That frustrates me too. 

She has gained some weight in the time we have been together and I think that might be part of the reason for her LL. Not feeling as sexy and whatnot. I understand that. I think she's beautiful as she is and I tell her that all the time but I guess the self confidence is probably not there.

We probably have sex maybe once or twice a month now.  I've always had the higher libido, and a stressful professional job. She's never been a touchy, affectionate type.

It's important to me that she be driven to have sex with me, or going down on her and feeling her legs shake. Her disinterest makes me feel like something vital is missing.

We go out dancing and drinking. She'll be all over me on the dance floor, but I'd be lying if I said trying to get her in the mood wasn't among my motives. 

Her body language and attitude kill me. We'll start to get into it, slightly annoyed adult. When I do stop, she gets mad. I find myself in situations now where I can tell she's really not into it, and I get this dreadful feeling that neither stopping nor continuing is right. 
 
Communication is not an issue. We discuss everything, I understand that it's hard to put an effort into being into sex if you just aren't.

I have been married for just short of 2 years, she and I had very different skill sets. I was one of the early bloomers who had received a lot of awkward hand jobs and blow jobs during high school into college. She had, however, been one of those girls who skipped from kissing to sex (Brief musical interlude: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqG0rc7vZX4 ) She literally showed me this video to explain the situation. 

Needless to say, she seemed receptive to learn more. Things went downhill from there...

Around the 1 year mark, but she felt uncomfortable with the whole situation. And so it just about stopped. She became so increasingly frustrated that she wanted nothing to do with me sexually. I understood that the meds were messing with her, and that I should be patient. 

Graduation, and an eventual move to a different state followed in typical order. I gave up a fruitful job prospect to put her through grad school, and we both moved 400 miles from the nearest family. I became increasingly depressed, frustrated, and lonely. I gave up everything, for her, and and working my ass off for no affection, and no appreciation. I dug in, in my limited field

Our routine included coming home, cleaning, cooking, and laundry while she focused on school and the careful metering out of the money that I brought home from work. We would watch TV, I would work on the computer, and pour myself a glass of whiskey before bed. She was completely unreceptive to anything and every advance. It was hell.

Here is her side: She felt unattractive due to some weight gain

My side: I was/am, on top of my profession, and feeling like my wife, my love, and I should enjoy each other. I will admit that at this point, I seriously considered exploring an extramarital affair. I was working so hard to make her happy, but without any reciprocal affection

Finally, I decided that I would lay the whole thing out for her, and give her the option to leave, allow me to have an open marriage, or to work through the issue to overcome what we both considered a difficult problem. She chose the latter option, and we have been working to better our relationship. Once we aired all of our insecurities and issues with ourselves, we offered our honest assessments of each other. I was an oversexualized male who drank and worked too much, unapproachable bitch who had no sense of what her man needed. These discussions were not pleasant

Here is the key: We talked it through. We were honest, but necessary. You just need to understand what may be holding your own self back, and be honest about your partner about how this effects you. 

We continue to work on the issue

I'm posting this on a burner account as wife is a redditor. 

Backstory is long but will keep it to the point. Wife and I have been together for 7 years. Found out she cheated on me with the same guy a couple of times over our marriage. We tried to make it work but it hurt me deeply so we separated and I moved out. 9 months later after much talking

Since then

The bigger issue being that she has always had a low libido and I have dealt with it in a understanding manner. Never pressured her when she says she is not in the mood.

Recently

I've bought it up several times that I do need some level of intimacy as I do have some trust issues (seeing a doctor about it) to keep me grounded and to reinforce that. She has responded that unless she feels in the mood

I'm almost at wits end. I don't know what else to say or try. I've tried everything listed in many of the posts and this subreddit but have had no headway.

When we first started dating, things cooled down, which is normal for relationships, and we settled into a pattern of one to two encounters per week.

Lately (in the aforementioned past six months), but we're down to something like once per month at this point. Worse, I'm always the initiating party, and often feel like I'm being thrown a pity fuck to shut me up. It's emasculating and I feel neglected.

Of course, we always end up discussing her body image and her job.

She's gained some weight in the past year; enough to hurt her self esteem, and it isn't what she went to school to do, but her chosen field isn't hiring, and she's starting to come to terms with the fact that she may not get to do what she wanted to do with her life. In the mean time, she pays into the household expenses, but I am the primary earner.

I know that these things bother her, I feel like we're just best friends but not lovers. It breaks my heart and hurts me dearly. Not to mention the fact that I get really down on myself when turning all of this over in my head.

It's gotten so bad that I've considered cheating on my wife just to relieve the frustration and give her some space to do what I know that she has to do. That's obviously not the best approach, but there's only so much that a guy can do in a nearly sexless relationship.

The background is a bit complex so sorry if it's a bit jumbled. Me [21 M] and S.O. [21 F] have been dating on and off for about a year. When we first ""got together"" she was still struggling with some issues of her previous boyfriend

 
We took a break for awhile

During our talks I've tried to be as open and honest as I could. I pointed out what bothers me, and compromises. We've had this talk countless times over the past year and each time either nothing changes or if there is more sex it's only for a week or two. I don't think my libido is terribly high- once every other day is my target while more than once a day everyday would be too much for me. She, on the other hand, would prefer 2-3 times a month. I realize I am the HL in this situation and she is the LL. She is on birth control but I could kind of tell she was LL even before she started taking it. She claims her finances don't allow her to change birth control (which is OK as there are other possible reasons to help our situation). She is also not willing to go to counseling because of the cost and idea that she can handle it herself. 

During our talks I've heard almost everything that has been posted here, she has said no. Sex is not something she will compromise for and if she doesn't want to have sex or be intimate then that's that. Anytime it's ""for me"" she says it feels faked and that makes her hate it more.

This is me just having a bit of a vent really. Taking the opportunity to tell my story even though I know there are only 3 options. It’s turned into a bit of a wall of text

 
My History.


I’m 56 years old


I was originally married in 1979. X had been raped at 15 so I was not surprised that the sex was slow, hugged and touched. Neither of us wanted kids and both had average careers. I was a fireman and she a secretary.


I met Y. She was married also and we were friends for a couple of years before I touched her. I was surprised when I wasn’t rejected and we had sex a few times. We were not ‘in love’ and it was never meant as ‘an affair’


Well


My current life.


Y is Low Libido. I discussed the fact that sex is important to me and she said that it would never be a problem. It was, sad that it was so rare but more than X.) 


So


They are still vivid though, changing the bag, cleaning up when it leaks (often at 3 am when we have to change the bed), the smell. She hates her body, she hates the doctors for giving her this bag, she hates the ‘plug’ that builds up in the remains of her arse, she hates me for calling the ambulance… 


I have spoken to her doctor about counselling but unless Y chooses to go it cannot be forced on her. You guessed it


And so to sex.


As I said she hates her body. I have managed to masturbate her a few times but the last time was more than 2 years ago now. She says that PinV hurts her but once every few weeks she will lie on her side and let me slip inside from the back, but No means NO! and I have to respect that.


I’ve asked her to ‘help’ me, you’re sex mad! Anything at all? I SAID NO!!!


My libido is reducing now. Yes, by me for taking it to heart and by the world because there have been no more than three other short relationships in my life. But I still mentally undress almost every woman I see. I still want to be held by, someone.


I don’t want to leave because:


1. It most ways


2. Y doesn’t / can’t work and has no income


3. Son needs stability.


4. At my age I’m scared of being alone. I didn’t know it until just now


I tried a prostitute but it was no better than having a wank. There was no comfort in it


I’m in the middle of the south coast of the UK if any older ladies would like some company! :)

Part the problem I am about to reveal is my fault because the roots of it go waaaay back.  I have been in a relationship with my wife for 20+ years

The sex has been infrequent since the birth of my first son over 15 years ago.  But at that point I was the one who resisted because I suspected she was trying to get pregnant again.  She always wanted a huge family but because she gave all of her attention to the first child and shut me out of a lot

At that point I began drinking more.  Kept drinking more and more.  And at some point I became a critical dickhead and alcoholic.  

Since then we have had sex less than 20 times, I have felt isolated from her and resentful of her giving all of her attention to the kids. We haven’t had sex in 3 years.  Or more; I lost count.  I resent her for that too.

2 years ago I decided that I was not going to live my life as a depressed drunk.  I quit drinking and went to psychotherapy.  

The last time I directly addressed sex with her was around then.  She said

There are very few opportunities to talk together

I’ve asked to go on dates but it rarely works out.  And I’ve kind of given up on bringing it up again

Anyway

I gave up trying to display affection probably 8 months ago when she stepped out of the way and brushed my hands off of her.  She probably has body issues.  (Despite some hair issues (balding
  
She sleeps in another room.  It started because she said I was snoring and she also didn’t like me surfing the web on the laptop in bed.  I took actions to correct both (stopped drinking and stopped using the laptop) but that did not bring her back to the bed.

I've been lurking this subbreddit for a while

My (24M) gf (30F) has a very low libido, but usually we do it either once every two weeks if the starts align, or otherwise once a month or every two months. 

She's my soulmate, we complete each others sentences, we complement each other in many things... but... she is never horny. Never has dirty or kinky thoughts, never initiates anything, never masturbates, ... this has remained constant throughout the time, but regardless, then it goes back to normal once partner is secured"" so I'm not counting on seeing that back.

I have not had ""The Talk"" with her yet. But I've given hints here and there, maybe I'm not doing enough... she hasn't shown interest for anything at all. I'm pretty sure she understands I'm concerned because even though I've never brought the issue as a dead serious problem, I've mentioned and talked about it enough times for her to realize that. She blames the enviroment, the place, the situation, work... but the more the time goes by the more I'm sure these are just excuses to avoid admitting the cold truth: that she has low libido and there's nothing I or she can do about it.

I don't think having ""The Talk"" or going to a therapist would help here in any case. I'd love for my SO to *want* to have sex more often

I have a growing cocktail of frustration, she is the best I've ever had and I really enjoy spending time with her and talking to her. When I can forget the aforementioned cocktail for a while, that is.

So... I've come to the conclussion the best I can do for the moment is to tame my libido. If I lower my libido, but this is what I want to do for the time being. 

What do you guys suggest? I'm growing specially concerned at the fact that masturbation just.. doesn't cut it anymore. Internet porn doesn't turn me on at all, but it doesn't feel satisfying, it doesn't really satiate me anymore. What are other things I could try? I really would prefer to stay away from antidepressants and any other drug in general by the way.

I have the strangest story I suppose. My wife and I have been together since the late nineties, or effort of time and patients would do anything at all. She would be confused and saddened by the resulting effects of not being turned on with me. I myself have the damnedest time having a good time with another human being if they aren’t turned on. If I don’t have that connection I’m turned off eventually and just going through the motions. I need a true partner into the whole deal with emotional connections and heated sexual desire as well. So this went on for, well, years as it turned out. 

Finally in 2012 she suddenly turned on again, no ability to get her going and frustration again. I thought she had just “turned on” and I would be scott free again. Sadly no. 
Now I am faced with her not being able to be turned on but being sexually aroused by other men. It turns out that if someone is interested and there is chemistry she is turned on

Sex with my wife of almost 23 years has been a slowly dying situation with any sex at all coming about once a month at best for the past few years.  I'm almost 45 and my wife will be 46 later this Fall.  My sex drive has not diminished at all since I was in my teens/20's and I don't see it even slowing down.  My wife's sex drive appears to be almost non-existent.  If any sex happens at all, sex was back where it was when we first got married (she was literally jumping me every night and she was actually making love to me rather than just laying there so I know she's still capable of being amorous when she wants to).  After the other person and I agreed to not have any contact with each other because it was going to wreck my marriage

I've have now decided to start an experiment to see just what it would take to make her interested in sex with me again.  I've always been affectionate toward her. . . I usually go around grab-assing her and pulling her close to me (which for the past few years has been met with nothing more than sighing and pulling away from me or with ""Let me go. . . I've got (insert whatever excuse) to do right now. . ."" every single time.  I actually looked at her a few months ago and told her that it gets very frustrating always getting rejected and that I'm not going to keep making the effort forever if this type of rejection keeps going on.  I guess she thought I was kidding. . . Now I've had enough.

For the past couple of weeks, no more hugging her in bed (for the past week, I've even taken it to the extreme of starting to sleep alone), and no more ""special treatment"" like picking her up a cup of coffee without being asked when we stop at the gas station for fuel.  This is an extreme change because, as I said earlier, she literally kept a full set of my fingerprints on her ass at all times (I'm always been like that with her) and all my friends tell me that I spoil her.  I guess this has put her a position of power in our sexual relationship. . . and power can be fleeting.

After 2 full weeks, I just kinda gave it a non-interested ""It looks fine."" and left it at that.  (I really liked it because she cut it very short and it made her neck look delicious!)  She knew this type of hair style normally sent me into fits and she looked kind of puzzled when I didn't make a big deal about it.  She asked me this morning if her hair looked OK because she taking the kids to a birthday party. . . I gave her the same ""It looks fine."" and said nothing more and went on about my business like I barely noticed (Yes, I really liked it!).  She finally got this really confused look on her face and said ""Humph. . . You normally can't keep your hands off me when my hair's fixed like this. . . When it shows-off my neck. . . "" and left looking really pissed.  LOL  I think my little experiment may be getting some results.  I'll keep you guys posted. . .

I don't remember her initiating it in the last 6 months+ She says she has really low libido

I tried pleasuring her without wanting anything back for a while

I'm quite dominating

If she's not in the mood I get it and don't push it

It's especially disheartening when I really try to make the effort - cooking a nice dinner for her, giving her a massage etc and she then turns down my kisses and goes on the computer.

I've told her this (minus the finding her less attractive part) but neither of us are sure what to do about it. She isn't a switch I can turn on and I get that

tl;dr: She isn't all that interested in sex and I'm concerned that this will be a slow death to our relationship.

1)  I have never experienced orgasm
2)  I do not masturbate.  I was never ""inspired"" to masturbate, there is no feeling...just numbness.  My SO purchased me a vibrator, and I feel so child-like and confused with it. Like, ""Uhh, what is this supposed to do?""  Any time that I am aroused, it is with a partner. Never alone.

All three were ""quickies"".

This is the norm now. He has his quickies every great now &amp; then

He has said that it is my extra weight gain (I have rapidly gained weight in the past 3 years because of a health problem that I'm getting back under control now). Ironically - he has been more than 50 pounds overweight since shortly after we married

The problem is - he didn't want me when I was thin

He only seems to want me if he thinks he can't have me. But then he gets bored quickly. The interesting part of this is that I am the only one who has ever initiated anything new

When we first got married

Now he says me not initiating is the other reason why we hardly ever have sex. Even now if I do initiate

His mother is a classic narcissist and manipulates &amp; controls all her children. She lives in a different country &amp; manipulates our marriage in all sorts of ways. Everything he does seems to be a reaction to her

But it seems like he is threatened by me being competent or self-assured. I've noticed over time that whenever I am confident he has to discourage me somehow

For a long time he wanted affection, he wanted to hold hands, play with my hair, etc. Now it is nothing. When he does touch me &amp; wants sex now, I feel like I'm being touched by a stranger.

It's as if he wants to have as little to do with me as possible. He only wants sex when he can't hold out any longer

My kids are 12 and 9. I no longer feel like this marriage has any real hope. I can no longer even imagine a future with him where we are a true working partnership with true intimacy. Right now I feel trapped because we live overseas and my kids are in an amazing international private school. I would have to wreck their lives to leave my husband.

Over the next 2.5 years, depending on work and stress, but never exceeding 10 extra pounds (I'm 5'2, anywhere from 130-140 lbs). The declines in our sex life don't always sync up with my weight gain, so I can't blame it all on that. The fact that we've been working together could definitely have something to do with it, but the sex was great even when we were working together 60hr/wk.

About 6 months ago, and I was in the best shape I'd ever been in since we met. After almost a year of stress, sleepless nights, and junk food where we worked together every night, we were finally able to sleep in our own beds (he lives with his parents, and I rent an apartment), work out regularly, I felt hot

I brought it up to him, and we had to leave for work early the next day), and now that we were working less, he wanted to spend more time at home with his parents. So yes, we weren't having sex because he wasn't sleeping over, but I felt like he could sleep over more if he wanted to. I don't like to nag, so I decided to let it go

I started out sad that I felt unwanted, but now the comments just sound rude, and I'll make a snippy remark back. Then we get irritated with each other, and the cycle continues.

I find him very physically attractive, and isn't looking for a better job, makes me feel almost like a mother figure. I enjoy cooking for him and taking care of him, but I always felt like I was demonstrating my ""wife"" abilities. Now that we're not having sex, I feel like more of a caregiver than a partner. These thoughts are creeping into what few intimate moments we have, and it's driving me crazy. Lack of sex is making me feel like a mother figure, and feeling like a mother figure makes me enjoy sex less

TL;DR- Sex frequency is decreasing with many possibilities as to why. I've already brought it up with him a few times, so how can I stop this before the weeks between sex become months?

Frequency of sex is not the only problem. Since getting wed, she is somewhere over 200 pounds now.  I try often to get her to wear sexy things, but she will always refuse, because she doesn't like her body, but she will not make any real effort to improve her body either. Combine this with the Coolridge effect, and my lust for my SO has dried up considerably. I will often see a woman who has a similar body type as my SO, but who puts on a short skirt with a boob top. I strongly desire the appearance and confidence. Recently at her birthday, and I was crushed. In addition

The Aruba trip a month ago was my last full force effort to repair the shambles of my sex life. When the trip was initially planned, and this wanton desire clouded my judgement that it probably wouldn't. In early October, I was able to have sex with my SO, after about a 1.5 month hiatus. Afterwords, a sex talk commenced afterwards. She told me tales of reinvigoration to our sex life, and to improving her body. She talked about wanting to have sex all the following week when she was off her period, and how Aruba would be a sex fest. I truly believed it

The illusion began to fade as quickly as it came. Before the end of the week, sex was not there. Not even once ever for the supposed sex week. No sex would be had at all that month. Once in Aruba, I tried to have sex, but again was shut down the first two nights. We had sex on the third night, after I was admittedly quite pouty during the day at the prospect of our sex lives going down the tubes again. I tried more for the rest of the week, culminating with the statement on the last night, ""Why do you always try to have sex with me when Im feeling tired""?

So here I am, and she is good around the house with responsibilities. I just wish things would go back to the way they were, but I think I have finally accepted that they will not.

This is the other side of that story. My side

I was in two long term relationships where I lost interest in having sex with my exgirlfriends.

**TL;DR Everything got boring and it's hard to want to have sex with someone who is boring**

Before the sex stopped, I stopped hanging out with friends, because in all honesty neither of these women had friends and just assumed all of my friends we de facto their friends. Now, people who don't have friends of their own tend to not be able to make friends at all, and to alienate the people around them. 

I know because I watched this happen. Twice. Both of these women entered my life and ended my social life, because I shouldn't have let anyone do that to me. But after going through that it's something I can never forgive anyone for doing to anyone else.

Other things stopped, positively hated every other kind of food, and what kind of moron tries new things anyway?

Keeping all this in mind

I had to initiate. I had to do all the work. They didn't prefer any position or have any opinion on sex

I heard way too many times

Does that actually sound attractive to anybody?

Obviously it became a topic of discussion

One actually told me she didn't need to do anything else since she had me in a long term relationship. Like I was her fucking pet, her child.

When I pointed out to the other that staying home every weekend drinking vodka and watching reruns was pathetic

Both questioned my masculinity during these conversations. Both accused me of cheating-- I never did

Both called me all sorts of names.

Then

I've been single for four years now and it's been the best time of my life.

What I have noticed the most while being single is that when I'm the most active, I have had a very high sex drive-- but that depends a great deal on who I am seeing. I've found myself uncomfortably close to getting into serious relationships with women who were much too similar to my exes, and my sex drive suffered when I was around them.

I was shocked by his side of the argument since I don't feel like that ever happens. We ended up deciding that when he feels like he is initiating sex he is being so subtle and tentative that I never realize he's not just being affectionate. For example, and just look at me. If I don't then take the initiative to throw myself at him he feels as if I have rejected his advances. How am I supposed to know that this time he wanted sex and non just a pre-sleepy-time cuddle? (more about this later- our morning sex issues definitely feed into him feeling like I always reject him) 

Since we talked the first few times I do try to initiate in that situation much more but always having to be the aggressive one still just makes me feel needy and unwanted. I want him to want me enough to go for it

Most of the time when we do have sex I don't orgasm. We've talked about that as well and I've assured him that sometimes I don't mind because it still feels really nice and I enjoy the feeling of closeness I get from sex. This is completely true

One of our other main problems is that he usually wants sex in the morning and I have a horrible time waking up. It generally takes me about 10 minutes to figure out where I am and what is going on. I can't move my limbs right away and have a cloudy, this makes it hard to get in the mood when he is trying to wake me up for sex and I tend to be kind of cranky until I stop being confused. That being said, once I am all the way awake I'm always up for some morning sex. The problem is that, even though we've talked about it and I've explained all of that, my husband is never willing to stick around until I've woken up completely. This leads to him masturbating in the shower on a regular basis.  We've talked about that as well and I've told him that I don't care if he masturbates except for when I feel like it's depriving me and our relationship. Lately I'm feeling very deprived. 

Last night I tried to initiate sex and he rolled over and went to sleep. That's fine, passive-aggressively asked me to do laundry today, and left for work. I'm really upset about it because he clearly chose masturbation over sex with me. He tells me all the time that he thinks I'm sexy and beautiful but his actions show differently and I'm starting to feel really bad about myself because of it. 

What's a girl to do? I've considered just going in there and joining in but I feel like there is a reason that he's left me out and he probably would just get embarrassed and not want sex anyway. We've talked it to death. No matter how nicely I try to approach it and how reassuring I try to be he always just ends up sulking and feeling attacked. Are there other ways that I can try to address my needs with him without making him insecure that he's doing the wrong thing? Would it be so impossible for him to wake up horny but wait until the end of the day and have sex with me then? I'm at a loss for what to do next. Any ideas?

tl;dr husband and I are in a dry spell sexually speaking. He's been choosing morning shower masturbation over sex with me and we never have sex unless I'm very aggressive about it. He's too insecure to have a productive conversation about it. I heard you guys might be able to help.

She never tells me if she's horny and can't articulate what turns her on/what she likes/what she wants to try, yet doesn't reject me in person (only long distance).

So I sometimes try to spark some sexual conversation very gently and she'll deflect by saying something silly.  Recently she told me sometimes she thinks all I think about is sex, and that I miss being intimate with her and having fun in bed, which she said she appreciated hearing (though it is very sad to hear she actually thought otherwise in the first place, I bring it up barely at all, like once a month).  I said I wanted to really talk about this more before we get married and she agreed to it.

We waited (by mutual agreement) to have sex until we were married. Before we got married

Here's the thing- when we have sex, what was 3-4 times a week when we're were newly married has slowly devolved into once a week or so now, only 4 months in. I know there are plenty of guys and gals in here that would live to get it that frequently, but it's just not enough for me. I end up feeling disconnected, unloved, and undesirable, which quickly devolves into a bitter and mopey attitude unless I am constantly holding myself in check. 

We are currently seeing a well-qualified pastor from our church (wrote his master's thesis on the importance of sex in relationships and is a certified counselor)

What seems to be the sticking point is that she nearly always refuses to engage in any sexual intimacy unless she initiates it. She has told me that she thinks that since sex is something to be shared and mutually enjoyed

Also, I go to school full time as well, I do all the cooking and dishes, I do the majority of the housework, and she gets daily foot rubs and other relaxing physical touch. We don't lack for affectionate physical touch, which is love language #1 for both of us (took the test and read the book). She is on hormonal bc (Mirena iud), but she has been on hormonal bc for years and it hasn't affected her libido. 

She regularly praises me for how affectionate I am and how well I meet her needs. I just understand why she won't meet mine. 

Edit: missed words

Second Edit: last night, and it came out pretty quickly that this was ""duty sex"" (my term, not hers). Needless to say, I I wasn't interested since she pretty clearly wasn't. We had a good talk, and it finally came out that some of the abusive and manipulative relationships she's had in the past are really affecting her. We will continue to work on this and through counseling.

Ever since we initially ""hooked up"" she's had an issue with vaginal penetration. The first few times we tried to have sex we had to stop as soon as I entered her because she said it hurt or ""stung."" Now, after bonding and showing her that I care for her, we were able to have sex and the thrill of that accomplishment kept us going for awhile. For the first couple years we were having sex regularly but it was never anything to write home about... I was mostly satisfied that we could finally do it and that I was able to get her off by going down on her. 
However
For one thing, she's always had an issue with French-kissing and I can't recall a time when we ""made out."" She's told me that she doesn't like it and it drives me crazy because I do, and I know from previous relationships that I'm not a terrible kisser.
This unequal distribution of affection filtered into the bedroom as well. I like giving pleasure but our sex has always been a routine in which I do 95% of the work and it became boring. Due to her penetration issues, we have intercourse until she finds it too uncomfortable and then we stop to finish each other off orally(me to her) and manually (her jerking me off). In the five years we've been together, I think I've orgasmed insider of her once. This routine, and the constant process of stopping mid-sex, has led to me feeling unsatisfied. I've addressed this with her and asked her if there's anything I can do to help and she agrees its a problem but has never done anything about it. I've also approached her about spicing things up in bed, asked her what turns her on and it's gone nowhere. She was reading 50 Shades of Grey and admitted that she likes it when the guy takes control.... but I've been taking control since the beginning and it's almost like an excuse for her to just lay there and do nothing during sex.
I've told her that I find confident women sexy and I wish she was more sexually confident but she hasn't attempted to change at all. She's a very beautiful girl, I think it goes both ways and I find I've become less and less sexually attracted to her.
To add to all this, I had a one-night stand with my ex. And though I still feel extremely guilty, I think about that night all the time.... it was the best sex I've had in as long as I can remember. We screwed all night long, hot and sweaty, grunting and groaning, dirty talking.... it was so good that we had sex again when we woke up the next morning. I regret it but at the same time I don't regret it.... it reminds of the fact that I love having sex and that with the right person sex can be absolutely incredible.
And this worries me because I don't know what to do now.
The boring and passionless sex
I've taken the steps to address the problem with her a few times now but I find myself back at square one again. I would love to know what you all think of this situation.... is it salvageable? Should I just give up? Is there something I'm doing wrong?

I’m a 26 female and my bf is 31. We’ve been together a little over a year. We are facing some serious DB issues and we are both unsatisfied. We both want more and better sex

In the beginning things were great. I joyfully told my friends it was the best sex I’d ever had. Then things changed over time. I realize this is only my perspective

Firstly, but I feel he’s just being lazy and so blames me. For info, it takes 10-15 minutes, and I always get there. 

I told him when we first met that I don’t orgasm from intercourse alone, etc., but like I said, that has disappeared. After awhile he suggested we stop having sex and just do oral because we know it works. Wow, did that ever hurt to hear my boyfriend suggest no sex at all. He said it was too much work and he doesn’t enjoy it because he’s only thinking of me and can’t enjoy himself. So it’s the “I’m too selfless” argument. To me it’s obvious that he is the one with mental blocks about it. There’s nothing unusual about not cumming from intercourse alone. I feel that I’m being punished because I can’t do it. 
Actual penetration is down to maybe 2-3 times a month, I’ll get you tomorrow” and goes to sleep. And tomorrow never comes. Pun intended. I’ve confronted him about this and he says he can’t function after he cums, so I can’t do him first. That’s fine too, but he never initiates, so what then? I don’t feel comfortable saying “Hi please go down on me.” That kills the fun for me.

He wants anal, and the doctors kept asking me if I inserted things into my anus (because that coulda caused the problem). I didn’t insert anything and it was just a fluke medical condition, but it required surgery and was very painful. I feel I have more reason than most girls not to do it. The other day we had sex and to make him happy I said “ok give it a try.” And he just went “nahh I know you don’t want to.” So I can’t win. I offer to do the thing that will satisfy him and he says no. 

During our talks about this he has repeatedly called me reserved. In reality, toys, lingerie, etc. and used them all with him. Yes, that sounds really uptight. I loved the wevibe but he didn’t like it. I used a vibrator on my clit alone, but he said it was distracting and he felt he had to hold out too long until I came first and by then he was numb. He’s upset that I won’t blow him after he has penetrated me. I’ve tried to just wipe him with a baby wipe first but he says that ruins it for him. He says I have too many “rules” about place and time for the act, but we both work 8-4 Monday to Friday

I would love some advice from you guys. I would say we are both average libido, and lots of love on both sides is there.

Edit: After another teary conversation about my non-satisfaction yesterday

edit: It has gotten a little better since having a few talks about this. I used a lot of information found on deadbedrooms and it really opened his eyes. He has agreed that he has a responsive libido, I'm never ever turned down, he just lacks in the initiation department. So maybe this revelation isn't the worst thing, it's just how he is and we have to adapt our sex life around it. Could be worse, I mean I can get it whenever I want it.

At one point before we started having sex, somewhat.  Lot of patience needed there.  It got me started saying ""I just need to do X and she will want sex as much as I do.""  I wish it hadn't.

She seems to experience very low levels of stimulation.  She has trouble getting wet, hates even being kissed in the morning, won't kiss me with tongue anywhere outside of the bedroom, hates receiving oral and isn't much a fan of giving it.  She can't stand 'mess' during sex, and was horrified of pregnancy (we're childfree) so much that she is afraid to even let me touch her down there if I've handled myself.  I had a vasectomy to deal with that and now she complains of the 'dripping' if I finish inside her. This doesn't leave me with a lot of options to get turned on by our foreplay, and most of her idea of foreplay is receiving a LONG back massage from me, then immediate penetration.  

After we started having sex, and I wanted it.

I lost fifty pounds

I proposed and she moved in, but also had planned to end her use of birth control and actually forgot to take her pill the last couple days before the wedding, bringing the period to start almost as soon as we were gone.  She then took some of the remaining pills to ""stop"" it.  That didn't work, and long story short, she was basically on her period for our entire 2-week honeymoon, excepting a couple days.  When I suggested we lay a towel down she threatened violence.  She DID eventually decide to do that anyway, and we had sex maybe half the days of our honeymoon--and that's the most frequent sex we've ever had--but it seemed like a far cry from what's supposed to be happening.

Now, and it got worse. 

Eventually

She has asked me to stop initiating and indicated she'll initiate when she's ready.  I felt insulted by this--as though she only wants it on her terms.  Unfortunately it's made me want to reject her the way she rejects me

I kind of feel trapped now, I did just that.  

Now I'm attempting to separate myself from it again

Her personal projects over the last year revolve around food.  Growing, 'boy I sure have been eating a lot'.  This prompted a discussion during which she asked me to help her stay on track with her exercising.  I was thrilled and she went for about two weeks before the excuses started.  Eventually I gave up because she just wasn't making an effort with exercising nor her diet.  Even if I could have convinced her to continue exercising, she wouldn't have made any progress because it's near impossible to out exercise a shitty diet.  She's been doing most of the cooking lately and was in the middle of long-term plans regarding our meals.  This made it near impossible to take over the food preparation as I would have liked.  I've made suggestions and requests and offers to take over, but I can't get her off the cycle of rice, pasta, potato with cookies after every meal, too little protein and too few vegetables.

After he returned, but also had a pleasant brunch and shopping outing. 

Yesterday after work, what is now, an enormous hole in the backyard. I was stewing in frustration, trying to figure out how to ask him for more intimacy or if he'd rather throw in the towel. He came outside and saw the hole and asked me what I was doing because I ""had crazy eyes."" I made a joke about how this is what sexual frustration looks like. **Foot in mouth.** NOT how I wanted to start the conversation, but I've never been good with controlling my impulses. He looked sad and uncomfortable and went back inside to prepare dinner without saying anything.  

I followed him in and asked him to not be upset. A perfect conversation then commenced. He revealed that he doesn't feel close to me or like being sexual with me when I act so nagging and high-strung. I explained that the nagging originates from a decreased amount of forgiveness and flexibility ordinarily bestowed upon someone I see as a partner and lover, I don't feel that we are lovers. He asked what I want, and I replied that I want to have sex at least once a week, and I need more non-sexual contact and attention too. He said that he needs to feel more peace and emotional connection between us. I pointed out that we're in a cycle where my frustration leads to behavior that turns him off and when he's turned off I get more frustrated. I offered to break the cycle by controlling my nagging and being more flexible, for a certain number of days, and then we could sit down and assess how we were feeling. He agreed.

I feel like his mother/sister at this point. We’re incredibly close, but there’s no sex/sexual tension/passion.

We met as I had just gone through a very messy divorce.... the sex was never great but I was fragile at the time and I never really paid attention. The alarm bells never rang in my head and looking back the signs were all there I just wasn't paying attention.

 We moved in together a year after meeting. Between us we had 5 children. Their ages when we first moved in together were  5 yr 9 yr 11yr 13 yr 22yrs... the two oldest being his from previous relationships. 

He was a good partner intelligent funny affectionate but also a workaholic. We both started new jobs/ business when we first moved in together and he would routinely work until 2 am in the morning leaving me alone at home from 7 pm ish.  Every night and most weekends he was at work. This went on for a number of years and even now he works some nights and virtually every Sunday night. 

Sex diminished until it was 3 times a year and then in the last 7 and half years we haven't had sex at all. Oral maybe once year but nothing in the last two years. I have lost all interest in even trying. 

He cannot maintain an erection. At first we tried counselling

He would constantly make excuses why we could never have sex.  When I challenged him on the subject he would become defensive and deny we had a problem or he would refuse to discuss it and promise me things would improve. He made it seem as if it was my fault - if only I would do this or not do that etc .. things would improve. 

In the last 7 years I have tried to leave him several times. I haven't for several reasons. My divorce was so traumatic I don't have the strength to go through something like that again and he has made it clear he wouldn't make it easy for me to leave. I have 3 children - its not that simple to just pack up and leave- he refused to move out of the house. I didn't want to put the children through another traumatic split and he is the only father my son remembers. 

I made him an offer to give him our home we had bought together, he could sell the house and use the profit to pay for a small two bedroom flat cash.  He refused my offer saying that it wasnt enough and that he wanted someone to look after him. if the roles were reversed I would expect him to look after me.  

Financially his business hasn't done that well and I have paid a lump sum into it to avoid him being prosecuted for arrear taxes. I offered to release him from that loan as well. It still wasn't enough to allow me to have an amicable split.

if you take sex out of the equation - we actually get along really well most of the time. However its like living with my best friend I am beginning to look at him as a friend and as much as I love him I just don't love him in a sexual way. I am not attracted to him at all. 

I don't want to see him hurt

In the last 7 years I have cheated on him with 3 separate guys. The first two was pure sex - it was like a stress reliever. Both one night stands purely physical approximately 5 years ago. I needed the affirmation that I could still be wanted.  I also had an active online cyber and phonesex life. It was the only way I could deal with having a cold bed.  Night after night alone I needed a distraction. I discussed the online chats with him and he told me to go for it. He didn't see it as cheating and if I enjoyed it then why not. I think he was relieved that I was being distracted elsewhere. I tried to open up the relationship physically but he wouldn't discuss it with me and once again kept promising me things would improve.  I have never told him about my two encounters.

Approximately two years ago I met a guy online. We became really close chatting every night for hours at a time. Phonesex daily. I eventually told him of my situation - he wasn't too happy about it but we continued to talk daily. I eventually bought a ticket and went out to see him for two weeks.  We hit it off straight away the sex was brilliant and it was incredibly hard to say good bye. We both live half a world apart. 

I am completely confused. I dont want to hurt my current partner

I am not sure if I am looking for advice - it just feels good to write it all out. 

Reading peoples stories here makes me realize I am not alone in this type of situation and my heart goes out to those who chose to stay. I just really do not know what to do anymore.

1338246960.0,u9f0n,Help save my bedroom,misterblank2,15,1,9,"I’ll try write this without bias

About me: I have a good career, I’m a hands on dad, I do my fair share of housework, I’m affectionate, communicative and a recovering “nice guy”. For some reason I’m also incredibly insecure and have some pretty big trust issues, which I’m working on.

About us: We have 2 kids together

About her: She’s one of those bubbly fun people, only in front of other people. It drives me crazy and she knows it. While I’m craving some PDA and getting nothing, she’s hanging off the shoulder of a some random guy. It’s gotten loads better from both our perspectives, but it’s still there.
Has trouble expressing herself in the bedroom, but never orgasmed. Grew up under the notion that sex was dirty.

She was quite upset when she learned that I masturbated. She hates porn and is not open to toys, I can feel her walls tighten and she gets extremely wet, gooey eyed, bites my neck and pretty much loses control, but stops herself and moves my hands before the climax. Why, I don’t know, but she says that she’s focused on “getting there” so much that she’s too much “in her head” and not enough in “the moment”.

She is breast feeding, she deals with it a few ways. 

Refuses to talk about it, usually in a torrent of abuse, or breaks down.

Naturally as a communicative guy I’m happy to talk about issues and problems

Onto the problem. I’m on my way to a dead bedroom. Our sex life has been the most confusing thing I’ve EVER dealt with. I’ve struggled with self esteem issues my whole life for one reason or another, but it was more than the frequency, she was “in to me”. After the first child, that seemed to change, where as we would still have sex, but there were “rules” attached. Don’t do this, don’t touch that, “I don’t do that anymore.”  She wanted another child and we fought a lot about it. I brought up issues with our current sex life, only this time I’ve had a vasectomy so no more kids. I feel a little like I’ve fallen for bait and switch maybe?

Our sex life is back to vanilla

Story down

I want to bring the fun and intimacy back
I want her to want me, but now if I try anything, my hands get smacked away. I read stories about guys being woken up in the night for sex and that’s NEVER happened to me, it makes me a sad panda.

I know she’s tired, study, kids, and housework, so am I!!! Even though I’m drained I could think of nothing better than settling down for some intimate time, but to her it’s just not a priority. 
She’s said that after being a SAHM, if anything I try to be more “intimate”, with massages, candles, hair stroking, just giving her some time to herself, baths, but it hasn’t changed anything.
I understand she obviously has self esteem issues, and I thought we were past that. I have them too, I read books, I’ve had counselling, I’m always actively working on it.
I want to be able to talk about it. This is my biggest issue. As soon as I mention it nowadays, we fight a bit, but nothing gets solved. She even said that because I talk about it so much “It makes her want it less.” So I leave it alone for a month and nothing changes. 

I’ve suggested couples counselling, I come home with some things to try and get stonewalled. 

I feel so frustrated

I feel I’ve doted on the negatives a lot here, not to mention two kids, so it’s not something I can just leave lightly. I love this woman, perhaps too much. I once read you should never love a woman more than she loves you and certainly feel this is the case here. I mentioned this to her and she just said “Don’t change who you are, it’s who I fell in love with.”

I realized a couple years ago that it seemed she would only be receptive to my advances after she was very intoxicated.  We talked about sex a while back and she said she prefers to masturbate instead of sex with me (and men in general). The last time we've had sex was July of last year and she was super wasted and actually initiated sex. 

Fast forward a few months ago she confronts me saying she is not happy in our relationship and was ready to walk away.  She assumed I would get mad and kick her out!  I've always been very supportive of her and her needs, but she made a comment the other day in therapy that kinda freaked me out. She said that she could go the rest of her life without sex, and has no desire to have sex.  She also said that she's always felt used by men in regard to sex.  This gives me hope that when we resolve her anxiety and self image issues that the sex may return.  Am I being too optimistic?

I don't bring it up or talk about.  When she does I just agree that it's not happening and move on.

I prefer sleeping with clothes on.  Anyway I finally did this one night, if I rejected sex

Most of the ages listed are young - 20's etc.  So

POF:  Premature Ovarian Failure.  I know quite a few women in their 20's that experience this.  They stop producing Estrogen and Testosterone which is what gives us our libidos.

Natural Menopause:  as a woman enters this, ability to lubricate and orgasm.  Estrogen is a part of the mix in that it gives us help in the lubrication area.

Surgical Menopause:  Menopause hits us as if we were slammed up against a wall.  

The symptoms for natural and surgical can be and often are debilitating.  Hot flashes, brain fog, loss of libido, urinary problems, bone loss, anxiety, depression, headaches, physical and mental exhaustion

Some some experience all and some just a few.

Andropause:  Testosterone levels start dropping when a man hits 40.  However, decreased ability to become erect or loss of erection, decreased orgasmic response, depression, diminished feeling of well being, fatigue, incontinence, memory problems

I think that any man or woman should get blood work done to see what their Estradiol (estrogen), then that can be an helped/fixed IF the person is willing to do that.  

How do I know all this?  I had a hysterectomy in 1987.  No doctor told me about the benefits of Testosterone and libido.  I went for 16 years with no libido.  I had sex

About 8 years ago, my libido came roaring back like a freight train.

I became passionate about helping other women like me.  I have a Yahoo group about the pellets with over 400 women and a few men.  One member is also a pharmacist that owns a pharmacy that makes the pellets.  I have personally helped over 100 women find doctors that do the pellets all over the states and as far away as New Zealand.  I get emails weekly thanking me for saving their marriages and lives.  These women come to me desperate for information about finding help.  Many of the women in my group are in their 20's and suffering from POF.

I've since gotten divorced and just married a wonderful man this fall.  He's 60 and I'm 58.  His testosterone level last spring was about 300.  He got 1200mgs of testosterone pellets inserted in his hip and all I can say is WOW!  He's like he was when he was in his 20's.  We make love  4-5 times per week

His pellets last between 5-6 months.  Mine last anywhere from 12 -16 weeks.

Besides the above, I think some cholesterol can, anti-depression meds.  Then add kids, work, financial problems, the list goes on....sex is the last thing one thinks about.

If it's relationship based

Guys, it won't. You can beg, plead, get mad, walk away, and just quit, it's not going to go.  You can press on the gas pedal (clitoris) forever and it's not going to go (orgasm).  But....put the right amount of oil and gas in the car and watch it take off!  Even if the car has gas, it's not going to go.  Same with the reverse...no gas and lots of oil?  Still no go.  It's the balance of the two.   This actually applies to both men and women as men have E and T as well as women.  

So is it possible that any of what I've written might apply to your situation?  If so

Well

I also figured that since I've changed the particular type of anti-depressant I take so many times with no effect on my libido, the two must not be related, but they all have decreased libido as a side effect.


I'm 25 now, but I'm hopeful.  I think my horniness will calm down a bit as the effects of withdrawl subside, and then I can finally be myself in bed.  I'm really excited to see what happens the next time I start seeing someone special.

But in the last month, he pulls away and remembers something he was going to do/show me on youtube/whatever. Sex is now a bed-time only event, and most of the time we spent the night together, he starts to get steadily depressed a couple of hours before going to bed, meaning sex is a no. I try to be as supportive, as understanding as I can, but he's resistant to even talking about it. 

Any time I try to make an advance, it's shot down. I kiss him when he seems happy, I continue suggesting more, he wants to stop.

Our bedroom isn't exactly dead, but am really not sure how.

We have sex 3-4 times on a good week, doesn't really have much interest in sex. She enjoys the sex we have, once we get started, and orgasms regularly (most of the time at least twice), but if my penis isn't in her then she isn't interested. I am thankful that she actually lets us have sex as much as we do considering she has such a low libido.

The actual problem comes in the the form of as follows. I had a paragraph

- She gets sore anywhere between 5-15 minutes into sex

- Playing ""beat the clock"" is very disconnecting because I have to imagine all the stuff that turns me on. It ends up feeling like I'm masturbating.

- She has lubrication issues

- She doesn't like to use lube to the point of being disgruntled if I try to force it's use.

- She doesn't like foreplay. Oral sex on her gets me scolded. Touching her sexually is sometimes tolerated for 30 seconds to a minute. She will

- She doesn't enjoy heavy kissing. Kissing heavily will only last about a minute tops before she has to turn her head from me because she feels claustrophobic.

- Positions other than missionary or doggy are a rarity. She prefers not to be on top because she gets tired after a minute or so. She prefer to lay back and let me work. Any more ""exotic"" positions are only achieved in the middle of very hot sex

- She usually has to say ""No"" to sex first before she will say ""yes"". This means I try to initiate by being kissy and fondling, she will drop her pants and say ""alright, come on"". It majorly deflates the whole experience for me.

- When asked

- There have been times when she gets crazy in bed, and attacks my face with her mouth. Way awesome! All of these times, however, have been when we were on the outs or separated entirely (make up/break up sex). The pattern I've seen is that she is far more open and free with her body when she is trying to get me (or someone else) to like her. Like having sex with me when she's not sure if I'll be there tomorrow actually seems to get her wet. **This is the only thing I've seen to actually turn her on**. Good information to know, but I have no way to reproduce this in a healthy manner. This awesome sex behavior usually only last about 2 weeks before it mellows back to the usual. There is also the very rare anomaly of her being really horny for no perceivable reason, which only tells me that it *can* happen but still have no idea how. She doesn't know either. "" I just was"" is her answer.

- Talking to her about it is embarrassing for her and usually leads to a very distracting argument about more abstractly related subjects. She doesn't not handle guilt well and is the type to be angry at others for making her feel guilty. This

- She knows I'm not satisfied

- She does not masturbate. There is inherently nothing wrong with this

- **EDIT** - Adding another point that is pretty important. She was date-raped 10 years ago during one of our ""off periods"". Not violently, is a major contributor to her knee-jerk reaction to control our sex. Hence the ""No"" then ""yes"", the lack of trust and comfort with different positions and likely overall anxiety with sex itself.

We (well I) developed a system to help us a little less than a year ago. She never initiated and felt pressured to initiate, I also had to be considerate to her soreness (giving her a appropriate time in between sessions to recover, usually 24+ hours). It also made her wonder when I was going to pounce on her. Every second we were in each other's presence and I wasn't attacking her, she was wondering when I would. It had the great side affect of making her think about sex a lot more and helping her get a little more turned on and get less sore.

We eventually, holidays with the family, getting a really nasty flu, and stress. We have been unable to get back on that horse through a couple attempts.

We verbally compliment each other often. I tell her she is sexy (and she is) but she has self image issues that make her feel unsexy. I'm not sure how to boost her confidence if my pawing and drooling isn't enough. 

I want to reiterate that breaking up and finding someone else isn't constructive right now. We've both slept with other people and aren't interested in sleeping with anyone else

I'm 23 HL, she just doesn't seem like she wants to be there, it's always me doing everything until she decides she wants to get on top. She always has her eyes shut, sex almost always starts with her facing away from me and me having to do everything while she just lays there. She very very very rarely gives/receives oral which she will stop after a few minutes and she won't try anything else...at all.

We've talked a lot about her LL over the years and have argued about it far to many times to count. She says I put to much pressure on her. She doesn't make any effort to do anything intimate with me, don't kiss her, don't be close to her and want to do things with her. She absolutely hates it when I say that it doesn't bother me when we aren't intimate, this is after trying and trying to have nothing happen again and again being turned down and rejected constantly and just giving up. She will make everything out to be my fault and in most arguments we have I have to walk out and leave the house because otherwise I have to spend hours arguing if I don't just agree with everything she says. When I come back she will then start the argument all over again so in the end I have just left a gap of time between another stupid argument which in the end I just have to bow down and agree to whatever she says otherwise it will not end.

So tonight there's stress all day kids fighting each other, then comes bedtime. More tears, from complete exhaustion. I have enough with story time and send everyone to their rooms. Exhausted at all the fighting I wonder if my husband still feels like doing the nightly routine watching a show or movie with the usual couch / floor seating arrangements. So while I am sitting in the dark waiting for him to show he seemly take forever. Finally I head up just to see if maybe the fighting was his limit too. He's fiddling with his phone and says he's resting and I should go see a movie with my friends... They had called earlier in the day. I had not responded. He says he's just too tired too exhausted to do anything. Just wants to go to bed. So I go. I come home and he's wrapped up as if he has been asleep yawns as I turn on the bathroom light and acts as if he has been asleep this whole time. So as I look over there it is clear as day. A giant load off his side of the bed. Obviously still fresh and dripping. So I say ""the least you can do is clean it up. I'm sick of stepping in it everyday. I can't be asked to clean it myself.""

Problem is he's the only guy I have ever really truly loved. He is the only guy I actually want. I don't want anyone else. It may sound stupid and it may sound idiotic but I want him. I want him to want me. But obviously he doesn't. Obviously I've had other options. But what am I to do about it?

* Do I just lay it out there tell him I'm lying about being able to deal without?  
* Do I let him know I have to suppress my own desires multiple times a day and satisfy my own urges?

* Do I come out with him about my other activities to suppress my urges?  

I don't have a damn clue!

Our last sex was 2-3 weeks before, so maybe that means she's receptive. 

So after the kids go to sleep we're sitting together. I'm kind of trying to start things but she's not really responsive so it's difficult for me to push things forward. It starts getting later and later and she makes a couple of vague remarks - ""If you're sleepy we should just go to bed"" and ""What are you going to do?"" She then gets angry - ""I thought we were going to have sex? Why are you taking so much time to start?"" Oooookay. 

I try to get things rolling with some foreplay. I go down on her, nothing too extreme, and she orgasms 5-6 times. We try to transition to sex, but we have to stop after a few minutes because of pain. She says I used my finger too much and irritated things down there. I wasn't doing anything extreme at all (actually it was very mild) but okay, every vagina is different and maybe hers can't handle it. Too bad, but it happens.

She got up and put her clothes back on. She came back and said that she had been in the mood for sex all day and had been looking forward to it, caressing, fondling, etc, but the whole time she just looked kinda bored. After maybe 10 minutes I suggested we should just get some sleep and she agreed. She got dressed again and said to me ""If you need some extra time to take care of yourself go for it."" I tried to explain that sex and masturbation are two completely different things but she didn't get it at all and again suggested I take care of myself before bed.

I'm not bothered by the failed sexual encounter. It happens. What bothers me is everything else. The whole time she never touched me in a sexual way at all. Apparently her ""really horny"" is to make vaguely suggestive comments and wait for me to do everything. And she wasn't the least bit interested in my pleasure

We're not sexually compatible. That's not new info but I didn't realize the gulf was so wide. Maybe way back when we were on the very edge of our compatibility zones but now we're way off.

Of course I can't say this could be the case with your girlfriends/wives, veg, seeds, nuts etc. Make delicious smoothies. It could give her body a kickstart.

1369284749.0,1evwt1,I don't know what I should do about the horrible sex life in my relationship anymore. (A little NSFW),horriblesexlife,17,4,34,"Hey guys. I'm not sure if I'm doing the format correctly or if I'm even in the right place so let me know if I need to fix anything. This account is a throwaway. My boyfriend knows the username to my normal account. Also

For informational purposes

At the beginning of our relationship (first 3 months) we used to have sex like bunnies. Almost 2 times a day

Around 6 months into our relationship he didn't want to have sex as often anymore. I still wanted to have sex at least once every two days. At the time

By the time we were a year and a half into our relationship we weren't having sex at all. He never wanted to because he was ""too tired from school and work all day"". I understood that because he did have a physically-demanding job, but if I didn't ask when would I have sex with my boyfriend? I could tell he was getting annoyed by me because I wouldn't leave him alone about it, so I just stopped asking altogether. I began to wonder if maybe there was something more behind why he didn't want to have sex. My thoughts eventually led to thinking that perhaps I was the reason. I began to think of myself as disgusting and undesirable. To say the least, my confidence went from a 3 to -5. If my own boyfriend didn't want to touch me, who would?

I tried explaining to him that I understood he was tired from school and work

Now, but I get so nervous and scared when we're about to engage. I know that sex isn't going to be pleasurable. I know it's going to hurt. I've told him this multiple times. I've been telling him that he needs to arouse me so it doesn't hurt when he puts his penis in, but he doesn't try to do that. He just brushes it off. 

Finally, which hurt me. I told him to be gentle and he got mad saying ""Well I don't know what the heck you want me to do"". After a while, he started falling asleep. Am I really that boring and undesirable? I moved his hand out of my underwear and turned my back to him so I could go to sleep. He woke up and asked why I did that. I told him, ""You're falling asleep. You're not even trying to arouse me. It seems like you don't care whether I feel pleasure. You just like to pound me, while hurting me, and use me as a cum-bucket."" He started laughing and said ""isn't that what sex is?"" I got so upset and just went to the bathroom and cried. He fell asleep and after a while I went to bed and fell asleep too.

This morning I was getting ready for school and I wasn't talking to him like I normally do. I was just too upset to try to say anything. I've been trying to work on my anger so I'd rather not say anything until I have calmed down or else I'll just scream and cuss (which gets me nowhere). He walked up to me and asked me ""Are you mad at me?"" I answered ""Please leave me alone right now. I'm trying to get ready for school."" He continued being persistent about telling him if I was mad. I was getting really annoyed so I just answered him and told him that I was mad. He asked me ""Why are you mad?"" I was irked by that question because he had no idea why I was upset. I told him ""do you really not know why I'm mad?"" He said ""No."" He fucking said no! I continued

So

**EDIT**: I wanted to thank everyone for their concern and their input. The general consensus here is that he's a manipulative douchebag. I can see what everyone is referring to and I agree that he is being a dick about this situation. I think it would be fair to mention though that he's like this towards the sex aspect of our relationship only. I'm sorry to have made him out like such a horrible person, trying to make special moments by taking me out to dinner or a movie. If I'm upset even a little he'll try to reassure me that everything will be fine. But when it comes to sex...he just completely changes. Now that some of you have pointed it out to me, I feel like there's something he's not telling me. He may be depressed, have low testosterone, may feel inadequate...I don't know. Either way, it still sucks that he's not trying to fix this issue- either by not trying or not telling me how I could help. I will try to talk to him some more, but when I have previously tried discussing with him the issues of our sex life he just avoids having any involvement. These are my new questions now: Should I be concerned about the different person he becomes when it comes to sex? Could this somehow be a new red flag? If the reason we're not having sex is because of something that has to do with him

EDIT 2: I also wanted to mention that this is not my first relationship. I've been in a couple relationships before and none have been less than 6 months long. I know that doesn't make me any more experienced,True,,t5_2t25p,1369351331.0,,,t3_1evwt1
1368265343.0,1e4ej5,Didn't think I'd end up here,throwaway51113x,16,3,18,"I'm a 29fHL married to a 30mLL. Been together a decade

He's always been LL and yes I made a huge error, it was just stress or his living situation or his job or whatever excuse. (He makes excuses and I make them for him but he has admitted/claimed for a long time now he doesn't really know what's wrong.) Ten years later and I am half dead inside. Like many of you I don't recognize myself. The past few years he keeps nagging me about keeping up with some of my old hobbies like ""you used to do such-and-such, I love that, why don't you do it anymore?"" Well maybe it's because there is no color or joy to my life when my own husband can't be bothered to remember I have a working vagina? I can barely get out of bed in the morning and crawl through the day knowing that the part of my life where I was a sexual being was over before my twenties. Arts and crafts just don't hold the same appeal anymore....

So I have seen my twenties wither away in a sexless marriage, all that stuff). We get along great and sleep in the same bed at least, so for the time being I don't think we're damaging the kids or anything. I would leave if it were better for them (having learned from my aforementioned shitty family) but they're still pretty young and for the most part the DB issues remain confined to the bedroom. (Outwardly anyway.)

He has tried counseling a few times and meds but nothing has worked. (He's been tested for some medical causes and nada.) He's with a new therapist and new meds now which seem more appropriate to his problems. But all it ever accomplishes is dealing with his feelings (mostly job stress), let me mortify myself to you so you can probably tell me my only option is to deal or divorce anyway.

The current dry spell is after having a kid so I thought, WTF? I've/we've actually never used anything but condoms so I didn't think it was too rude to mention. I know it's not fair to hold this incident against him but seriously, come on. Why the fuck am I going to go out of my way to get to a doctor appt and get this physically intrusive birth control for no fucking reason? Duh!

I want to love him so much but all I feel lately is contempt. Every little thing he does I'm thinking ""Stupid asshole!"" or whatever. Nice way to be right? I have made a huge effort to do more around the house (after getting some depression and medical issues taken care of) thinking being a better wife would spark some interest. Nope. He basically told me today that he's been helping out less around the house because I've been doing more! Like it was a win or something. He thanks me for doing things but that's all I get

And now I'm contributing. My sexual side is dead and I feel too awkward to take an active role in trying to fix this. He of course puts in no effort. He will have sex with me if we argue about it (!) but it's awful. He clearly has no interest in pleasing me (or himself really) or even trying anything different. The rare sex we've had has been the EXACT same routine every time for ten years! It's not that he's selfish, lazy, not truly interested, yet somehow completely oblivious. I know he could be good in bed if he put in an ounce of effort. If he were 10% the man in the bedroom he is outside it I'd have no complaints. But if he would even listen, how do I tell him that? ""You suck in bed"" doesn't exactly light the fires of passion. And I'm not in a position to be turning up the heat when I feel like a disgusting monster. (Not to mention feeling more virginal than when I was a virgin!) On multiple occasions (on my own or at his request for help) I've given him books or clear instructions (literally a step by step few paragraphs-long guide to cunnilingus) and he had no problem casually admitting to me that he never even glanced at them.

Sooooo healthy right?! Every day I think about leaving

Through writing this I realized why I don't work on this anymore. Because if I give it any more effort, or even talk about it, that is an investment I can't take lightly. If I fail it will kill me or force me out. Logically I know he won't change and I need to go if I want to be happy. But I'm not willing to face that now with two young kids, improving but tight finances, and job prospects that are okay but won't totally pay the bills on my own. I can't face that decision right now. Hanging around feeling worse isn't better but I'm not ready to be alone yet. Not to mention how shitty my self-esteem is right now after a DB and two kids—I doubt any man is going to be interested in my post-pregnancy body covered in stretch marks and loose skin.

And yeah, if anyone could be. So I am abysmally alone in so many ways. Imagine how much relief I felt when I found out a few years ago other people deal with this! Wouldn't wish a DB on my worst enemy but it's nice to know it's not just me.

All the things I've missed kill me. I did things with high school boyfriends my husband has never even mentioned in the best of times. (And I'm pretty damn vanilla if you couldn't tell, holidays, a sexless joke. Actually I've come to dread holidays because I know I'll just be sad and lonely that night. Even making our babies was scheduled out and routine. Forget creating these beautiful children out of love. I had a fucking fertility calendar reminding me to let him know we had to have sex that week. Yeah. Don't even get me started on how big a sign that is NOT to have kids (though they are totally worth even this misery I'd rather have them with a man who notices me). I will never get all of that back and I have no idea how /not/ to resent my husband for that.

I wonder if I should just get ballsy and send him a link to this. I know I won't. He knows enough of this already and hasn't changed. He never will. It would just cause a fight followed by an awkward attempt at obligatory sex. Then we just have more resentment built up on top of him knowing how unhappy and angry I am. Well

Thanks for listening. It's almost 3am and I'm about as lonely as I am at 3pm. Sigh.",,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1e4ej5/didnt_think_id_end_up_here/

She's a nice person, I did not.  Fastforward to the present, I'm raise our child and keep the house while she works at a university and is pursuing her PHD.  So on top of never feeling wanted or attractive to her now I can't even offer intellectual stimulation.  She disagrees, but I feel like I could easily be replaced by a nanny.  I feel like that's my role anyway, the only difference being that a nanny wouldn't sleep in the same bed (but really that's about it).  I've gone back and forth on whether or not to leave, but I don't think I can do that to our child (soon to be children).  I've even brought up having someone on the side, a friend with benefits type situation

I don't think I can have that 'sex and intimacy conversation' again, I do find myself picturing it.  We've been to couples therapy and I've been to therapy on my own (stopped going since my therapists child started school with mine so I see her frequently, little awkward and not sure how she feels about it).  I also acknowledge that our current residence isn't helping since we live on campus where I see so many happy young couples who are overly sexually charged 24/7.

This has been bothering me for a little while again, to which she said she was fine, but worried about me.  I don't know why but that seemed to break any mental barrier I had up holding back all of this.  We haven't talked yet, and honestly doubt we will (she's rather busy in general and has a lot going on personally so I don't expect her to remember).  Anyway, I think I just needed to vent, but any advice or thoughts would be really appreciated.  Thanks for taking the time to read.

I stumbled onto /r/DeadBedrooms and so far it has been pretty cathartic.  Also

My situation is somewhat unique than most i've read.  We will have sex almost as much i as initiate, so i won't look to someone else.  

Early in our relationship I was informed that she can't and won't likely have any orgasms

She soon developed an aversion to me touching her vagina.  The only time it became ok to touch her there was when we(I) were preparing for penetration.  Coupled with no feedback on how to please her our(my) foreplay diminished to nothing.  During the act itself she is very rigid

I read somewhere, all i interpret her saying she doesn't want any of this, that she's submitting only because i want it.  

So basically now i fear sex.  I feel alone.  I feel rapey.  I feel frustrated.  I feel inadequate.

I need to have 'the talk' with her soon

The sex has never been mind-blowing. In the first couple years it was good but my wife is not sexually adventurous. For the last 3 years or so we've had sex, begrudgingly gives HJ's though hasn't done that in 6 or 7 months. When we do have sex there is no foreplay - she wants to get to the act. She doesn't like pillow talk - doesn't like sex with lights on - doesn't want me looking at her when we have sex. Generally

She is willing to work on this but that generally amounts to lip service until I can't stand our situation and blow up at her about it.

Some background information that is really necessary to understand the situation we're in:

* She was molested by a babysitter when she was a kid and her parents didn't do anything when she told them.

* We can't have children because I have asymptomatic Azoospermia - no rhyme or reason why but I don't produce viable sperm (low sperm count is 20 million in a sample - my last sample I had 7 total sperm - not 7 million

* She is constantly stressed about everything in her life - work

* I run our finances

* I am based out of the house for work so I am typically home by 3:30

* Over the last couple years we've both gotten on track with our health. She's lost 190 lbs and I've lost 80 lbs. The sex hasn't gotten better

* We sleep in different bedrooms because she's a light sleeper and I'm a heavy breather/snorer (no I do not have sleep apnea). I do not agree with this situation and want to sleep in my bed more (currently I sleep in there Fri/Sat nights)

* She is on Wellbutrin (you know

Last night we had a talk because I found her crying in our Living Room. What set her off is I tried to come on to her on Friday about having sex and she said

So on Sunday morning we wake up, that's the difference, you're doing it to make a quota, I'm doing it because it's enjoyable and fun. I then go on to tell her how I'm lonely, how we're not connecting, how I need intimacy and I take confidence from my partner desiring me. She says she just doesn't want sex - with me or anyone. 

I feel duped and cheated out of a sexual relationship. I bend over backwards for her to make her life easier and she won't even sleep with me!

Anyway, that she loves me. She wants me to work on 'my stuff' w/ my therapist - my stuff being my self-confidence, emotional neediness.

I'm thinking the most likely reason she experiences pain is because she doesn't get in the mood

When we were doing it at least once every 3 weeks (even that was bad enough) in the two years before

I used to always suggest sex, but she wont go. It should be noted she has mild Aspergers Syndrome.

She is not cheating, sometimes i feel it's in the companion way rather than lover? Make sense? I feel like our views on love have drifted apart over the years. She is comfortable with love as being simple hugs, a peck on the cheek and ""i love you'"" comments from time to time.

He says that it doesn't bother him, even though I absolutely do.

Let me stress that in general these things are small issues that come up occasionally, and I was really excited to get it on with him. We were going down on each other, and he started licking me kind of hard, and it stung a bit, and I asked him to be more gentle. He lost interest completely. He just laid there, sort of slowly kissing me, until I asked him if something was wrong. He assured me that it didn't make him feel bad when I asked him to be more gentle, he said that my asking him to be gentle made him think that sex was going to have to last several hours in order for me to reach orgasm

I've had to work a bit to become someone who can comfortably initiate sex or ask for what I want, that it was ""sexier"" or whatever. It's become difficult for me to masturbate, because every time I get horny I immediately think about our latest sexual mishap. I want to reassure him that just because my orgasm is elusive, it doesn't mean he's bad at sex or unattractive. But I also want him to reassure me of the same thing.

Just to give some background... he recently graduated college and got a job in a different state, which has been slow to the point that I feel depressed and useless. I'm planning on starting school again this summer. Also, he'd been taking Adderall while he was in school, but he stopped after we moved here, which I think took a small but understandable toll on our sex life. About a week ago he started taking it again. I've struggled with weight-related body image issues for most of my life, but am currently the fittest I've ever been, and wish I was better able to enjoy sex in my ""new"" body.
