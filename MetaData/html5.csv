I made this originally as an easy way to get a voice chat going in video games without built-in voice-chat support. Other methods require exchanging usernames, installing programs, etc.

Right now I'm using the excellent and well-documented [WebRTC library made by Muaz Khan](https://webrtc-experiment.appspot.com/) and performance is great. Node.js in the back

Please let me know what you think. It's supposed to by extremely simple and straight-forward.

The two major issues on my mind now are:

* Improving the audio controls. Right now
* Occasionally there are two people who can't hear each other (although everyone else can hear each other and both of them). This probably has to do with the STUN server being unable to ""punch a hole"" in one firewall/router pair. All of that stuff is a huge mystery to me

The website includes a small ladder system developed with CodeIgniter

The game runs Box2D on the rendering thread (I may move it to a web worker eventually) - but that is not the issue. For people who can run it fast enough to be able to profile it using the Chrome developer tools, so I have compiled them into per-object images. It uses requestAnimationFrame, only when the Box2D world has finished ticking. It clips the canvas to ensure no extra effort is done to render objects outside of the viewport.

Basically

Via mouse, group them together, create piles, spread piles out, create new ones,  and edit or delete old ones.

One requirement that makes it more difficult in canvas (though it seems possible via canvas and absolutely positioned text blocks) is that displayed text should be selectable so it can be copied.

Actually out of ignorance, but is that right? Would SVG be a better fit and if so, why?

In some ways, something else?

1371087352.0,1g8lo0,When will we have UDP?!,JimmyJamNobody,7,0,16,"I just hit a roadblock developing a fast-twitch html5 game. Websockets only use TCP which are just way too slow for this. I'm aware that webRTC datachannels are coming along but they seem to be soley p2p. We need UDP connections with servers! Why don't we have this already? It's insane.

**Edit:** I'm by no means a master in this subject, and if the packet doesn't arrive, it will resend it. This uses more bandwidth than UDP for the packet confirmation and holds all of the other packets up. So one small packet loss has a compounding effect, causing a whole bunch of packets to be sent late.

**tl;dr:** problems with TCP for reaction gaming as opposed to UDP:

* increased bandwidth used per packet
* does not allow packet loss leading to knock-on latency after any amount of packet loss.

**Further edit:** I think our best bet is the [webRTC project](http://blog.chromium.org/2013/06/play-cube-slam-real-time-webrtc-video.html). They already have peer-to-peer UDP via the RTP protocol. If this could be extended to include servers then it would bridge this gap.",,t5_2r7u2,1371167236.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/html5/comments/1g8lo0/when_will_we_have_udp/

So for the last few months I've been working on a slick little project to manage my emulator and rom collection. I already use it on a daily basis. I have the entire thing working well

What I would eventually like to get going is a simple menu system similar in appearance to the x-bar that sony uses with it's ps3 and psp system.

I have an API that acts as a communications layer between the html document and the host application. It already handles things like launching games, etc.

Javascript is kind of not my thing though. I'm not very good at it. I'm much more used to statically typed languages

So I guess what I am looking for here is

* a good UI toolkit or that will play well with non-traditional input methods (no mouse)
* mentorship (a js buddy that can push me in the right direction when I go off course)
* and / or somebody who would like to try and create a theme on their own.

I'm building an offline HTML5 app (it will be delivered as a zipped up .crx file). It will be installed and used entirely offline. At no point will there be internet access.

AFAIK, but accessible to the javascript code, and then on the first run, put into the database.

What's the best way to do this? (Both from a development/maintenance standpoint as well as actual deployment)

Do I create a database in development and write additional code to spit that out as one of these:

    JSON objects?
    Arrays?
    Actual JavaScript code for inserting into the IndexedDB?
    CSV files?

* Image class ( caching and simple rendering )
* Entity class ( self contained object with update &amp; render methods )
* Input Manager ( simple isdown for mouse &amp; key )

I admit, these include:

* Tile based and entity collisions ( using AABB )
* Multi-channel audio ( with caching - not working 100% )
* Animations ( split images up into frames )
* Timers ( frame based and 'precise' )
* Tilesets and Tile maps ( pre-rendering on the maps for speed! )
* Websockets ( send,..] - very simple )
* Vertex based shape rendering ( uses render types akin to that of Game Makers' primitives )
* Smart redrawing ( using 'dirty' rectangles

Regarding the app it is aimed to be a desktop app (like old school Photoshop.exe for instance).  

What is the best way to make the Menu system along the top of the app in the browser?  How should this be done using HTML 5 canvas?  

Typical headings would be:

 File

I am hoping that someone in this community can help me make a case for using HTML5 instead of the C# code that is being put in place currently. 

The goal is to do the following: 
1. Pull images from a database and present them as resized thumbnails in a slider. 

2. Thumbnails from the slider can be dragged and dropped into a ""drop zone"" on the page.

3. Thumbnails can be resized while inside the drop zone and layer order can be adjusted.

4. Entire drop zone can then be captured and saved as an image by clicking a save button.

5. Meta data is stored along with the saved image. Example: If you drag a Carrot and an Apple into the drop zone and save the picture it gets stored in a database along with the original attributes (tags) assigned to the components that were dragged and dropped.

I am wondering if someone out there can point me to any resources that would help me learn how to accomplish the above tasks. 

Currently I have this all set up using c# but it is not ideal as it does not work on smartphone browsers and iOS tablets etc. I am thinking HTML5 might be the better way to go.

What do you think? Am I wrong in my assessment?

Oh yeah - everything is running on .net servers if that makes a difference. Unfortunately this can not be changed. 

Thank you all for any insight you may be able to provide.

So, etc), but I'm not sure how significant they really are, when decent canvas libraries abstract that sort of thing away by having their own object-based approach.

How does that work? Were there any changes to javascript?

Is there any article that explains how HTML5 is able to do what it does?

I guess what is confusing me is that whenever you see shiny stuff like drag &amp; drop it's labeled HTML5 - but isn't it actually javascript that's responsible for that behaviour?

There's a copy of the page at:

http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1482003/canvasshadow/404y.html

Here's the function that's causing the problems:

function makelight(){
	var bcxt=beamcnv.getContext(""2d"");
	bcxt.clearRect(0,document.height);
	var midx = (beamx+beamx+(130+textpos*4))/2;
	
	bcxt.lineWidth = 5;
    bcxt.strokeStyle = ""rgba(250,0.3)"";
	bcxt.fillStyle = ""rgba(250,0.8)"";
	
	beamx+=15;
	bcxt.beginPath();
	bcxt.moveTo(lampx
	bcxt.lineTo(beamx
	
	bcxt.arcTo(midx,beamy+60,(90+(textpos*5)));
	bcxt.lineTo((beamx+(130+textpos*4))
	bcxt.lineTo(lampx
	
	bcxt.closePath();
    
    
    bcxt.fill();
    
    bcxt.stroke();
    beamx-=15;

	
}

I've tried changing the color from rgba to ""yellow"" but that doesn't help anything.
I've fiddled with the z-index to make sure it's not just being rendered behind anything and it doesn't appear to be. 
I've taken out the ""arcTo"" to check if that's what was causing the problem - it wasn't.
I've looked at Mozillia's dev pages for canvas and I can't find anything that says this shouldn't work.

Anyway

Contact Page: Box to write name

Gallery Pages: For this he wants of course his pictures, and option to add to cart.

Other Pages: Basic writing with some more pictures

So my question is, and how can I learn. I do not know anything about webpage coding at all. Also, the site he uses to edit his photography site is homestead.com, if that changes anything. If you are wondering why I am doing this, its for the large amount of money he will pay me, I am willing to whatever it takes!",,,,
