Obviously we're all impatient for Phase 4 to start and answering the same questions all day every day is likely frustrating but it's worth remembering that FFXIV hasn't really started off on the best foot. With that trainwreck of a launch in 2010 making Square a total laughing stock people are hardly going to be rushing in droves to buy ARR

It doesn't really take that much effort to simply give them a helpful answer and maybe a polite link to the FAQ where they could have found it along with whatever else happens to be in there.

I know this might sound like heresy by saying this on the /r/ffxiv subreddit

I played the first two months of 1.0 almost exclusively with redditors. 
I was one of the original sack-holders for the 1.0 Reddit LS

http://www.ffxivpro.com/player/Aegis/Seiken-Valk


When MMORPG players start a fresh new game, I'll be the LS Alchemist."" or ""Hey, feed me shards and ore and I'll make the LS weapons!"" As you would expect, this turns out to be a logistics and diplomacy disaster. What I don't think many people realize is that Reddit is not a small, exclusive entity. If you look at the side-bar, **there are about 14,500 FFXIV redditors.** While I don't think we were this large back at 1.0's release, but there are also a lot of inconsiderate

During the first few weeks of 1.0's launch, so isn't it fair for you to craft them free gear when they ask for it? With hundreds of Redditors in game, you can imagine how terrible of an idea this was. Players who cared even less just stopped responding to requests and quit FFXIV after being fed tons of mats. This is what happened with the original Karma Knights leader, Hito Goroshi. **What initially started out as some kind of semi-socialistic endeavor to help out other redditors soon became a disjointed and somewhat jaded group.** 

It wasn't until only about 8 players were left that we decided to abandon the Reddit name. Those of us who remained started an independent endgame LS called Dancing Mad led by a redditor who wasn't active in the original Karma Knights. Now 3 years post-release

I know that the launch of FFXIV 1.0 was a fairly unique situation. Many players were very disappointed and under a lot of stress. Should they keep investing their time and energy into a game they did not enjoy? Or should they cut their losses despite any obligations they had towards others who helped them? I'm not trying to judge anyone. However, then that is great. But **don't let your expectations of playing with people who you have never met or really interacted with influence how you will play the game.** I hope players reading this can save themselves a little bit of a headache and have a more rewarding experience in 2.0.

**Edit (8:45 am EST)**: A lot of people are commenting that the problem was a lack of leadership or that the problem was crafting related. I understand,Discussion,False,self,t5_2rgs7,1376484863.0,,True

We've extracted a lot of data from the game and we are proud to be one of the first and most community driven websites for FFXIV database related information! The database contains information related to Items, Achievements, Emotes and such :D

We recently completed the Maps tool which shows all the maps in the game with overlays for: F.A.T.Es, Important Places, Landmarks, NPCs, Gathering Points and Mining Points. Icons have tool-tips to show what they are and you can click on zone lines or use the drop-down menu to navigate :)

**What is early access?**

Early access is a period of time before official service begins where those who have permission will be able to play the game.

**Isn't that the same as phase 4/open beta?**

No.  There are two key distinctions between them. 

First

Second

**When does early access begin?**

It starts on August 24th

[Source.](http://i.imgur.com/PMW87Se.png)

**When and where can I put in my code?**

The site will open on August 20th

**How can I get early access?**

There are only two ways to gain early access:  Legacy-designated accounts and those who pre-order.

**Do 1.0 players automatically get early access?**

No.  For a 1.0 player to get early access

**Do Beta testers automatically get early access?**

No.  You must have a Legacy account or preorder.

**I have my early access code.  What do I do now?**

First

[EU version here](http://preorder.eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/gb).

**I inputted my early access code

No.  There isn't a way to tie your early access code to your FFXIV service account just yet.  You most likely entered the code on Square Enix's member's site

**I ordered from Square-Enix directly

Square Enix has said that they will email you your code at a future date.

For Digital River related downloads

**I ordered from a third-party retailer

Generally speaking, after your order has been confirmed.  

If you preordered from a third party

Please be advised: it has been reported that EU online orders are sending their codes out at a later date

**I ordered from NewEgg

NewEgg is not part of the early access program

**Can I just buy an early access code?**

Square Enix has not made this option available.

**What does a preorder code look like?**

It is an 18 character code

XXXXXX - ### - XXXXXX - ### is the general format people have been reporting.

**How will I play the game before release if I don't have my software and product key?**

Square Enix will contact you with directions on how to download the client.  You will not need your physical products for early access.

**Once I input my preorder code

Yes

*After doing some thinking about this, which was emailed to testers who applied for PS3 beta.  There is no real way of knowing what will happen, but I wanted to make sure this disclaimer made it in.*

**Do I have to preorder the Collector's Edition to get early access?**

No

**Will the Collector's Edition Digital Upgrade qualify me for early access?**

No, and as such, will not come with early access.

**Gamestop gave me more than 1 code -- what happened?**

They simply printed multiple codes

**My Gamestop told me they were out of codes -- what happened?**

The computer is reporting that codes are exhausted at the time of preorder

**I preordered with Green Man Gaming

The code you got from GMG is an early access code.  Your FFXIV:ARR product keys will be emailed to you at the release of the game.

1373910874.0,1icq15,Chocobro.com // FFXIV Web Sim,Eein,173,21,70,"I have been holding off on releasing my site for now, and DRG ready for it

Chocobro.com is my personal domain for my web based FFXIV sim
The idea of the site is to optimize rotations and have a tool available to judge gear upgrades and raid optimization.
I will also have job guides with stat weights and other data generated from the sim.

Before I go into extreme detail

The sim uses Javascript (GASP!!!) to run the sim. The reason why I chose javascript is because it is a client-side language. Which means it will use YOUR processing power to run the sim rather than the servers. This keeps me safe from my host and any harassment from their end in case the site gets busy. It also allows me to develop rapidly instead of using a low level language like C++.

Instructions:

You input your lodestone ID; If the job is available it will import your character and run a parse to the precoded priority system. 

You can set iterations; Fight Length;  and up to 2 bards to personally buff you.
Food/consumable support coming soon.

I'm currently using the available DPS formula (95% accurate)

I will have options soon to adjust your stats manually (in the case of gear optimization and stat allocation)

EDIT: For those who want to see what it looks like
http://chocobro.com/sim/?lodestoneid=361126&amp;iterations=100&amp;fightlength=300&amp;bbqty=0&amp;bbmp=2500&amp;tpsettings=0
-----

For the future: 

1. Set up a beta release repository for modules so trusted module developers can make fine tuned adjustments to increase damage.

2. Move to C++ and a GUI with biweekly/patch releases once a stable web sim is completed.

3. Only DPS classes will be supported right away
There's really not a reason to sim healers besides to have grumpy people compare throughput which has always been a pretty sore topic (imo).

4. Show the priority used for criticism by the playerbase. All priority rotations will be tested and verified under a ton of iterations. 

5. Tons of other stuff!

Please leave any questions here!
&lt;3!

EDIT: Just a note - Since lodestone beta will go down and characters erased

Also, let me know!

EDIT: If you're a free company that wants to crosslink send me a message!
I want to make a FC's Using Chocobro page called 'Chocobros' :)

EDIT:
I'm also planning on setting up some documentation of the features available and what is in place for each class. When I do patch notes, and I'll have it fixed asap. Be sure to leave your name so i can credit you on the bugfix :)

I am bored without my FFXIV fix so I created a quick 6 question survey asking about the REAL you! I love surveys and I think it would be neat to figure out what this subs Demographic is! It will take you under 1 min to complete and I WILL post the results to the survey at the end of today or early tomorrow. I may leave it up longer depending on the popularity of it. 


**NEW SURVEY LINK** : https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1e_6MuSSQLsBwwVVj3LkIHNN6BP59Yx4pYzWUqNmCrXM/viewform

EDIT: Deleted my old edits because they pertained to the old survey. I used surveymonkey.com and they wouldn't let me view answers passed 100 people without paying. So I said screw it and I created a new survey in google docs! It is much better and allows everyone to view the results in real time! Sorry for the mess! 

EDIT 2: NEW SURVEY LINK IS UP: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1e_6MuSSQLsBwwVVj3LkIHNN6BP59Yx4pYzWUqNmCrXM/viewform

1372366437.0,1h7cf9,The Macro Thread,PessimusMax,164,15,186,"I'd like to start a helpful, here we go.

First of all:

###[**Official Current Command List**](http://forum.square-enix.com/ARR-Test/threads/36955-Instruction-Manual-for-Beta-Test-Phase-3-%28Windows%29?p=686800&amp;viewfull=1#post686800) as of Beta Phase 3

I'm not sure if people who don't have access to the beta can access this site or not, so ask away.  Don't be afraid!

###**What is a macro?**

A [macro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_\(computer_science\)), and sometimes conditionally (unsure of this in FFXIV:ARR) if certain circumstances are met.  For FFXIV:ARR, they must use the commands in the aforementioned link to work.

###**Why are they necessary?**

Macros are not *necessary*, or saying multiple things, you can have a macro button you just hit and it will do this for you.

Scenario:  Let's say I am a CNJ or WHM and I want to [Raise](http://www.xivdb.com/?skill/125/Raise) someone after our group just had about five people die.  Then let's say there is another CNJ/WHM.  What if we both start casting Raise at the same time on the same target

Macro Solution:  As a CNJ, *without typing a thing* and only pressing one button.

The Macro:  Here would be the macro to do that:

/s Raising &lt;t&gt;

/ac Raise &lt;t&gt;

You prepare this macro ahead of time and assign it to a button.  All you have to do to use it is target a dead player and press that button.  Let's say the dead player's name is Quina Quen.  When you use this macro

This is just a very small, then welcome to the world of macros!



**Basic Commands** to get you started (non-exhaustive list)

Please note that [brackets] and ""quotes"" I do not believe are to be actually put into the macro.  ~~Will confirm this weekend.~~ **Update:** Brackets are definitely *not* needed, a player's name.

Please post MORE of your macros in the comments, follow some basic macro etiquette:

* Don't use macros that unnecessarily start throwing /say

* DO post macros that have excellent functionality

###**ADDENDUM**

#""**Ugh

There can be much consternation with some when it comes to people using macros.  Typically though, etc. excessively.  For example, don't be that guy/girl who will use macros like ""/s I call upon the power of &lt;insert diety here&gt; to heal &lt;t&gt;!"" *every time* you cast Cure.  This is going to get on people's nerves when they are trying to focus on the fight.  In social settings, RP settings, sure, but use your macros with your community in mind.  Don't be an annoyance; be a boon.

[Lodestone to see level 31 THM stats (all points into INT)](http://na.beta.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/1896196/)

---

**Playstyle**

Right now the most important aspect of being a THM is managing 
your two main buffs: *Astral Fire* and *Umbral Ice*. Both buffs last 10 seconds and refresh when you cast a spell of their same element

&gt;What do they do?

*Umbral Ice* gives INSANE MP regen. I literally go from 0-100MP back to full 1064 in 5 seconds. You essentially have infinite mana as long as you keep this buff up by spamming Blizzard. *Astral Fire* stops ALL Mp regen and makes Fire I/II/III spells cost more, you quickly learn [Transpose](http://xivdb.com/?skill/149/Transpose) at level 4. The basic gameplay idea you will realize as a THM is to spam Fire for optimal damage until you run out of mana, Tranpose to Ice, and spam Blizzard while waiting til MP returns and Transpose back to Fire.

    Note that Tranposing Ice II/Fire II only carries over one stack to the alternate element.

**Other Skills**

[Thunder](http://xivdb.com/?skill/144/Thunder) and I have a love-hate relationship. At first this spell seems really weak, in-game damage. Once you get Thundercloud, you have a chance at some interesitng interactions. If you want to plan on using Thunder in your rotation early, I would do it while you're in Umbral Ice and getting MP back. When you're in Fire, don't waste the time or mana on anything but fire spells.

[Sleep](http://xivdb.com/?skill/145/Sleep), then 15 seconds, then 7 seconds. This spell lets you sleep adds in dungeons, run away from a fight, give you time to Cure yourself, turn 2v1 guildleves into 1v1, and even cheese through story quests by sleeping enemies instead of fighting them.

[Scathe](http://xivdb.com/?skill/156/Scathe), this one has no cast time so you can use it while kiting. The downside is it's weaker than both Blizzard I and Fire I and has no relation with the buff system. Also, its [trait](http://xivdb.com/?skill/90071/Enhanced-Scathe) is underwhelming. Still, being mobile has its advantages.

Sprint, out of a red circle, or kite a mob.

**Cross Class Skills**

* [Cure](http://xivdb.com/?skill/120/Cure)[CNJ Lv.2] - The single best skill I took from any class was Cure. With Umbral Ice giving you infinite mana, put them to bed for 30 seconds, get all your HP and MP back, and then resume the fight. This skill is a must.

* [Protect](http://xivdb.com/?skill/123/Protect)[CNJ Lv.8] - At level 17 when I first got this skill, since their version has [Shell](http://xivdb.com/?skill/90058/Proshell) added on to it.

* [Raging Strikes](http://xivdb.com/?skill/101/Raging-Strikes)[ARC Lv4] -Increases damage dealt by 20% for 20s. I like to use this when I have all my mana back right before I Tranpose and starting spamming fire.

* [Inner Release](http://xivdb.com/?skill/59/Internal-Release)[PGL Lv12] - 30% Crit for 15s. I use this one right after RS because it lasts 5 seconds less. Same idea with use. Using them together

* [Second Wind](http://xivdb.com/?skill/57/Second-Wind)[PGL Lv.8] - Instant cast and you get back 15% of your max HP immediately. Sometimes we eat a nasty spell or hit from a boss and need a way to get back HP fast. I pop a Hi-Potion and this bad boy at the same time and usually get back 50%~ of my HP immediately. Feel free to Cure to get the rest back.

* [Foresight](http://xivdb.com/?skill/32/Foresight)[MRD Lv.2] - Some defense never hurt

* [Bloodbath](http://xivdb.com/?skill/34/Bloodbath)[MRD Lv.8] does *not* work on magic spells

---

**Dungeons - Big Bada Boom!**

The most important job of a THM in a dungeon is to sleep adds. Add a marker to your hotbar if you don't want to keep pressing Shift+M and let people know what mobs you will sleep. In a 3 enemy encounter

The second role of a THM is the obvious one of nuking your enemies. Pop some cooldowns, then Fire I and Blizzard I will do fine.

The third role of a THM is to use the AoE Limit Break

The last role of a THM is acting as an offhealer. Yes, my INT is only 27 points ahead of my MIND. I mainhealed every GuildHest up to level 30 and every dungeon up to Haukke Manor on my THM before we needed a CNJ in the party. CNJ's have mana problems in long fights. We don't thanks to Umbral Ice. Even with a CNJ in your party, you can help offset the load by throwing some Cures in critical conditions when the tank dips a little low or when the damage is spread out and serious (Ifrit's Hellfire). Later on the Cure probably won't heal as much and we won't have access to it as BLM but right now it's amazing and you should use it. Sometimes I barely even cast Blizzard/Thunder while under Umbral Ice and choose to Cure people instead.

---

**Spell Speed and Food**

Physical classes have instant skills and a 2.5s GCD recast timer that is affected by Skill Speed. Mages have a cast AND recast timer that is affected by Spell Speed. Having more spell speed makes you cast faster and it lowers cooldown. They both go down in a 1:1 ratio so you should be able to spam a spell immediately after finishing a previous one.

I started off using Dried Prunes for the 8% spell speed (max 2), Piety and Vitality instead. Accuracy wasn't that important.

**AS OF JULY 1

---

**Criticisms**

Having a bigger MP Pool didn't seem to make a difference for two reasons:

* I never ran out of mana under Umbral Ice buff.
* Cost of fire spells increased proportionately with my level. I can only ever get off 5-6 fire casts before being out of mana.

If you were playing under Fire buff

I haven't really tested to see if the cost of spells is affected by level

Another criticism is [Manaward](http://xivdb.com/?skill/157/Manaward). It claims it only works for magic damage so I haven't really found a niche for it yet. I'm hoping I'll figure something out next weekend.

**Beta experience Pros and Cons**

Pros:

* Infinite Mana ^^if ^^you ^^keep ^^ice ^^buff ^^on
* Sharing loot only with the healer. If you're the healer and there are no other THMs in your party
* Cool long range nukes
* Good AoE capabilites
* Current rotation allows room for all spells to be cast
* Lots of CC - Sleep, and Bind
* Being able to offheal comfortably with a decent MIND stat
* Has Scathe as an option for kiting

Cons:

* Squishy - Low HP Pool with cloth armor
* Rooted while casting. Moving interrupts all casting spells.
* Burst style of damage due to skill rotation
* Not as much damage as LNC or PGL class
* Not really sure how they will compare to Arcanist

Tips:

* Mash the hell out of your spell buttons. You can atually start casting  your next spell before the animation of the previous one finishes. This will severely improve your DPS and Cures.

* use /action ""Cure"" &lt;tt&gt; as a macro. This let me keep my target on the boss while still healing the tank. &lt;tt&gt; stands for ""target the target of my target"". That's why I have two Cures on my hotbar on f10 and f11. The second one heals me or my current target.

* There's a bit of a sync issue with the game. That's why you can get hit by red circle skills if you move out too late even if you're not inside when it finishes. You can abuse this as a THM. You can start moving towards the end of your cast without interrupting. In the case of Blizz II

* Sleep is my favorite spell to [Swiftcast](http://xivdb.com/?skill/150/Swiftcast).

* Cast Scathe or Aero before using Transpose since Transpose works off the GCD.",self,t5_2rgs7,1376585319.0,,uldah,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1gzdso/thaumaturge_primer/

1376157812.0,1k3kzs,We're almost there: Getting the most out of experience chaining at release.,hopebaby,154,28,133,"For those of you that may not have tried experience chaining in groups

Before I found out about the beta function that allowed you to get your classes from 1 to 15 by talking to an npc, each level getting faster and faster by finding new ways to jump experience. Then when I figured out it could have been easier in beta, I felt like an idiot, but an idiot that will have an easier time in live then most.

Experience chaining is not really a new thing. FFXI had chains
Here is basically what I found out about FFXIV chains specifically:
    
**The obvious:**
    
* When you kill two mobs that are your level
    
* When you kill more mobs after the timer begins within the time limit
    
**The not so obvious:**
    
* For each member in a party
    
* In order for you to get full experience
    
* Killing marked targets count towards your chain. Most people never realized this

* Exp chains in FATEs are broken as hell. Why do I say this? I had the fortunate chance to join a FATE party under the level of the mobs in the FATEs. Though I did not always gain the full FATE exp bonuses

 * What does this mean? The exp chain caps around chain 8
Now you might say, all mobs that are part of the FATE are automatically pinged for you if a member of your immediate party kills it. This means...GET A FULL 8 MAN PARTY AND GRIND!!! Try to get your party to ping as many mobs as possible so others doing the fate don't remove your chains. Don't worry, they still get full FATE exp and mob exp as long as they keep fighting, so you're not grieving them for real.
    
* Increasing the number of party members does not decrease experience gained. This means the more the merrier! Get your friends and go kill stuff. Quickly!!
    
 * **One VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:** When you are in the last 10 seconds of the Exp Chain timer
    
* And last
     
 * Player 1: Attacks target mob that is at least his level or higher.
 * Player 2: Kills target mob that player 1 attacked.
 * Player 1: Gets full experience.
 * Player 2: Gets reduced experience due to mob level. (who cares
 * Player 1: Attacks a second mob at least his level.
 * Player 2: Kills the second mob.
 * Player 1: EXPERIENCE CHAIN!
...rinse and repeat! I've gotten a friend up to about chain 14 before he outleveled the mobs we were fighting around level 8. Before level 8 you probably wont get past chain 6~8 before they level again.
 
I hope this helps! Good luck in your chaining!!

1372606393.0,1hd95g,White Mage : Phase 3 - Things you should know and look forward too,Eliroo,146,28,90,"
Hi guys

I'd like to introduce myself a bit before I begin(Boooooring stuff). I play a lala on Sargantas named Lavieh Sevald (Call me **Lavi**) and I played during the end days of 1.0. I have level 50's of all DoW/DoM classes and I'm a pretty versatile player

Ok 

* **Cure Combo'ing** - Instead of the boring ""Click the highest cure number and win"" mentality SE decided to make our level 2 healing skill our bread and butter. With a scaling potency and no gimpy cap

* **Medica II/ Cure III** - Ok so both of these are AoE heals. Cure III stands at a 400 Potency and Medica II stands at a 350 potency with 50 pot 15 second Regen ( 600 Potency over all). Medica II also cost ~200 more mana but it is also the strongest healing spell aside from benediction that a WHM has. With that being said Medica II will probably be your go to AoE healing spell

* **Divine Seal / Presence of Mind** - Though content is lacking I can easily see both of these being crucial to WHM's kit come the last 25% of a bosses health. DS alone will save you tons of mana and probably best paired when you have Free Cure or Over Cure active. PoM isn't what it was before (Sadly) but the minor casting speed increase that it gives can save lives and when paired with Raise... well can bring back lives. Getting the THM **Swiftcast** also helps out immensely.

* **Cleric Stance/ Aero II/ Holy** - Cleric Stance is amazing, *meaning when you click off cleric stance the damage of the tick will be the same as if you had cleric stance on*. Not to mention that Holy is on the GCD for only 500 MP and is an AoE stun, you can create a lot of opportunities for your party. Finally WHM isn't just a curing bot!

Ok now the things that disappointed me :


*  **Regen** - I had to put this first, could critical, was effected by divine seal and could possibly proc Free Cure. Now before you say ""But its instant cast on Regen! And you can leave it on a DD!"" - It takes up the GCD and burns your mana rather quickly for such a small effect. If you want to regen everyone you are better off casting Medica II, If you want to heal someone you are better off casting Cure I. As it stands... Regen is useless. Even if the WHM AF boots do give you increased Regen Potency - The cost is still to expensive to justify casting it.

* **Stoneskin** - Can I tell you how much I hate Stoneskin in 2.0 ? Don't get me wrong- It is a great spell... For tanks ( Or anyone who has over 4000 health). I just hate that it scales off of their HP and not something you can control

* **Shroud of Saints** - In 1.0 SoS actually meant... SoS. Now healing seems to build up almost no enmity


My overall thoughts:

SE did a good job in making WHM very interesting. You could easily click 1 and 2 all day and get some sort of results but good WHM's will be Healing


Anyway

1371348006.0,1gfk33,FF XIV : ARR the best mmo experience since EQ1,ImSorryIV,132,17,126,"For me FF XIV : ARR is the best mmo experience in the past decade. Here's why:

* **Graphics:** Something everybody agrees on. The game beautiful

* **The FF Factor :** Playing this game, well you will be ecstatic about all the references to the franchise and if you are not a fan, it won’t really matter for you. The world, is a FF world, the characters, the humour, the graphics, the materia

* **The Music :** Something i never cared for in a game until now. After playing every FF game there is, or comes a cinematic, the music feels so nostalgic and just reminds me of past gaming adventures. 

* **The Cities :** The cities in recent MMO’s are really just these hubs without much to them. In FF XIV : ARR the cities are awesome, you have many establishments you need to visit which create a link to the city. It’s not 1 daily quest giver or the AH, it’s many many place’s and NPC’s that give it the feeling of the old mmo’s cities. 

* **The NPC’s :** Like every FF game, scroll as fast and you can and just gtfo. You learn to like them, appreciate their humour, and let them finish their text.

* **The Mechanics :** The game isn’t breaking the mold of the MMO genre. Nothing is really new, levelhest, Guildhest, Materia, all the guilds and their quest lines, a typical FF class and Job system etc) and some innovations like the Fate or the Armory systems. All the systems in place are really solid. The game have everything in it and more. It won’t be a GW2 without a Group Finder system, or a half ass Guild/Friend list interface or incomplete stuff. This game have everything

* **The Interface :** I beta tested the game back in 2010 and hated the interface, you have all you need, it’s pretty ergonomic and have a FF feel to it as you will recognise some of the interface parts from other games. It can be adapted to your linking and there is plenty of options to mess around.

* **The Gameplay :** If you are a PC gamer
For me, grind, and customisation around your character. You can level many class’s with the same character, mix their spells, and build your own class out of what you got or you can tailor a job that is meant for a specific role, it’s a little bit restrictive compared to the freedom of the class system but also more efficient and powerful for the role you want to fulfil and you don’t even have to choose since you can’t have and do both !

* **It feels like an MMO !** There was people all around i swear ! i talked to some, talk to each other, and get that urge to just play together and group and socialise which is something nonexistent in the recent games. The World is huge, the cities are huge, everything is overwhelming and it have that 1 hours part that the old gamers know very well where you are lost trying to figure out things and wonder around the main city  trying stuff.
It have content ! and i’m not talking about the late game content, but not as sandbox as an archeage. It’s just enough for the fans of both types to enjoy themself a lot.

Essentially, and someone in your shell/FC signs on and wants to do something? Maybe you would have dipped out to go play with them, but now you have no clue they even said hello of offered to do content in lS because you can't see it. It's a huge detriment to this game and is the first thing that legitimately cuts into the social aspect of the game (Duty Finder itself as a concept does not, nor does fast paced gameplay).

I think this is something that SE needs to get some more noise about. Every other game can handle this, but that's a load. If they made it impossible then they need to make it possible, or they're going to severely hurt the experience of their game. 

I'm generally not one to complain or make a big fuss

 **Building a House**

&gt;The housing system will be instanced

&gt;Housing will cost a lot of gil. It has been said that in order to buy a medium sized plot of land you will need to spend the equivalent of levelling a class to 50 on quests three times and put all the gil you earned into your house. Large plots will be insanely expensive and there will only be 3 such plots per instance. It may be better to start small and work your way up. But there is a twist. Land prices will fall over time if the plot has not been bought up. So it is effectively a good gil sink



&gt;Two types of housing will be available. These are free company housing as well as individual housing

**Customization**
&gt;In each house you will be able to build parks and towers, making crafting faster to level, to aid in HQ crafting or to increase the rate of gil acquisition.**

1372976635.0,1hnqoi,Paladin - Phase 3: Things to look forward too (Bonus WAR vs PLD comparison at the end!),Eliroo,127,26,118,"Ok so I refilled my cup of coffee and I'm ready to talk about our knights in shining armor. If you were to talk about MMO Tanking and what the usual MMO tank looks like I would immediately point my finger over to Taric and than over to PLD. Sword and Shield with white shining armor it looks just as heroic as it sounds. While in ARR a Paladin looks like its iconic self throughout the series I found that it wasn't as iconic as I thought it would be. For starters - Paladin's can deal damage and they heal for very little. Well let's get to chattin!


Things to look forward too:

* **Sword Oath** : I underrated this skill so much... and in the end I was so wrong. This is a straight 25 Potency that is tacked on at the end of your auto attack (Two numbers pop up) and for me it was doing roughly 1/3(?) of the damage my AA's were which leads me to believe that Paladin's AA is at a potency of 75. Regardless this skill adds a lot of damage. I must applaud SE for making PLD a competitive DD in such a creative way.

* **Shield Oath** : This is a PLD's answer to Defiance. Essentially you lose out on 30% of your damage but you get a straight 25% damage reduction and double enmity generation in return. I must say for PLD this skill makes holding hate extremely easy. So basically PLD has two forms : Deal Damage and Tank or Tank something that hits really hard and I like that choice!

* **Savage Blade Combo** : So unlike Warrior paladin doesn't get some fancy damage increasing Combo but what they do get is a fancy enemy damage reducing combo. Most of you have probably been spamming this already since you have access to it in the beta. Honestly this is the only legitimate TP combo you get as PLD and most of the time you will be using it. But that's good since 10% STR reduction is probably extremely awesome( I don't really know).

* **Riot Blade** : This skill serves a niche role and is only really viable when you **NEED** mana. But regardless it will really help you out in a pinch.

* **Spirits Within** : This skill has a really cool name and looks really awesome. While a situational 1s Silence is nice I'd like to think of this skill as DPS tool. I think it should be used whenever its off CD and you are &gt;90% HP. This skill does up to 300 Potency with full HP and does less damage with lower HP ( I don't know exact  numbers : ( ).


* **Provoke** : For those of you who missed Valkky's description on how this skill works : Basically it takes your current hate value and matches it +1 with the person with the highest hate value (All credit to Valkky for figuring this out). This makes Provoke an extremely useful skill! Just not in the way we are used too. Obviously this skill will be best used after you die and you wanna snag hate back but it can also be used to offtank. I think this skill will create a lot of different strategies involving two tanks and I can't wait to see what the end game content brings.

* **Flash** : This is your only real AoE threat skill but it comes with a huge mana cost. I think the most useful thing about Flash is its level 20 trait that gives it the blind effect. I will cover more on good Flash uses in the tips section.

* **Shield Swipe** : I think this skill will go underrated as well. Basically you need to block to use it but it only costs ~40TP(?) and gives the mob a 5 second pacification effect. From what I've seen this applies to bosses to. Pacification means that the target can't use skills for that duration. This will make PLD the more ideal ""Stand still"" tank and will definitely relieve a lot of stress from the party. 

* **Bulwark/ Rampart / Sentinel / Convalesence / Hallowed Ground** : Ah the panic buttons. These skills are obviously pretty self explanatory. Bulwark will give an almost guaranteed chance to block which is good for Proc'ing shield swipe. Rampart and Sentinel are both good for mitigating damage

Things that I'm a little less excited about :

* **Shield Bash**: 150 TP and on the GCD. That should sum up why I'm not to fond of this skill. Can you spam it and keep a mob stunned? Yea you can but you will burn TP pretty quickly and probably lose hate eventually. Not to mention that MNK/DRG/WAR all have a stun that are off the GCD and cost no TP. I don't really find a use for this in a normal party setup. My opinion : Take it off the GCD and remove the TP cost or just lower the TP cost.

* **Blocking** : Now I didn't spend an extremely long amount of Time on my PLD but while using my Hoplon ( A shield that specializes in blocking more often) I noticed that blocking sucked. It felt like I had a natural 15% chance to block and when I did I was only blocking for about 8% of the damage. I mean if I'm gunna block something with my shield I wanna take no damage. Maybe it is just me but blocking seems very underwhelming. I was looking at some numbers that Valkky posted and they were rather discouraging too. If you are gunna play PLD don't spec for blocking since the results don't seem worth it. I could be completely wrong. If someone else played GLA/PLD extensively and agrees or thinks otherwise please comment below.

* **Lack of a specialized self healing spell** : PLD can get cure and that is great. At level 50 it heals for about half of what my whm can heal - Which still isn't that bad. That really isn't my problem and I'm not sure if this is a problem at all. Just in every FF game I played where a Paladin is present they get a pretty decent healing spell. Maybe the answer to this is to just raise the MND of PLD a bit or give them a spell like Holy Succor. Maybe its just my Cecil fanboy coming out but I'd like to PLD have a bit strong healing magic side to them.


Some tips from playing Paladin :

* When going through a dungeon keeping Sword Oath up until you run into a miniboss/boss is more than likely ideal (Though I can't tell you how hard the mobs will hit in later dungeons) and then use Shield Oath vs. the harder mobs.

* Don't use provoke at the start of the fight or if you already have hate.

* Flash is cool and all but you could probably use that mana else where. Try splitting apart your Savage Blade combo onto different mobs to keep hate if your DPS aren't focusing them down. Try to become less and less Flash reliant when it comes to tanking mobs.

* Don't spam shield bash. Your WHM has MP and you have MP and a slew of other skills to protect yourself. You are probably just going to end up losing hate if you keep blowing all that TP. Only waste the TP if you absolutely need too.

* IMO don't stack all your reduction skills. Spread them out over the fight since consistency is ideal.

* So at level 50 THM gets a teleport skill. If you ever run into a big pack of mobs have to BLM nuke them all and teleport to you. Then you cover them and let them finish it off.

* Healing and Stoneskinning yourself will always be good choices in combat. Figure out which one you need more (Damage mitigation or Damage healing) and use one!

* Don't use Riot blade when you are missing a little bit of MP

My coffee is getting cold!


______________________________________________________________________________________________

**Now let's talk about Tanking in general**



First a few tips :

* If a trash mob in a dungeon slips by and starts attacking a DD don't make a big deal about it. This goes for the tank and the other players. Trash mobs really don't hurt all that much and they don't really live that long. It isn't the end of the world if you or your tank can't let that one sprite hit your precious DD. Now I'm not discouraging you from trying to hold all the hate just saying that it isn't the end of the world.

* Single target enmity holding is easy in this game. If Provoke didn't make it easy already the enmity bonus on the two tank buffs make it extremely easy. Honestly - There is no excuse to lose hate on a single target. You can almost do it mindlessly.

* Sometimes you will be splitting your priority in some fights. SE likes to shake things up (Ichorous Ire). So watch the hate meter and warn someone if they are holding the 2 mark on the hate list.

* Dodge

* Love your WHM.

* Be the party leader

* Tanking is easy in this game so don't stress over it or build a superiority complex over it.



Now time to put on my big shoes and start stepping on people toes. ( I really feel this deserves its own post... but w/e)

**Paladin Vs. Warrior - Job vs Job**

So you can basically classify every tank in any mmo into three different categories: Straight HP Tank , before reading any further, is asking yourself ""Which type of tank would I rather be"". I can only hope that we eventually get an Evasion tank! (Monk does not fill that role lol ) 

Now to actually compare them. **Both Jobs are very similar** and I'm positive that SE will make it so each on can tank whichever instance since that is the path that they seem to be taking but ATM I feel WAR has a slight advantage. Here are my reasons why:

* **Tanking** - Holding enmity is easy for either of the two jobs so no point in comparing but let's talk about taking damage. PLD has a lot of mitigation spells in between Sentinel / Bulwark / Rampart / Hallowed Ground / Rage of Halone they can significantly nerf the amount of damage done to them

* **Dealing Damage** - Warriors will deal more. I can tell you this hands down. My Warrior with a ilvl 65 Serpent Axe was dealing 40-50 more damage with Butchers block than my PLD with an ilvl 80 Garuda's weapon Spirits Within. Sword Oath will catch PLD up in terms of DPS to an unstanced WAR but if both of them have their main tanking stances up (Defiance/ Shield Oath) I'm afraid that WAR will pull ahead. Why ? Well first there is the fact that WAR gets Unchained/ Berserk and Infernal release at their disposal but also because Warrior gets skills that are not bound to the damage reduction (Steel Cyclone 

______________________________________________________________________________________________

* So WAR is better and I should just invite them right? **Absolutely not.** Dungeons are easy with any tanking classes and I feel the difference between the two tanking is pretty small that it won't make a difference. **Let people play what they want.**

* So I should just level WAR then right? **No.** I don't know what end game content will look like

* How would you make PLD better ? Probably fix block so its more impactful on the game and up the damage of Spirits.

Anyway... Thats that. I'm sure someone will disagree with me - And thats fine. Opinions are ok as long as you understand mine and I understand yours^^

I may get to BLM tonight.. Maybe...

I am making this post to provide some clarification on a subject that seems to be confusing to a number of people. Specifically, I will go over how and why the class/job system works the way it does and address those issues as they come up. For most examples I will use the relationship between Pugilist and Monk as it is a currently available frame of reference. I will also use Arcanist/Summoner/Scholar as examples of how you can expect the system to work in the future. I am not making this post to convince people that they should or should not LIKE the system. I will address concerns only where system itself inherently addresses them.  Lets get started. 


The class/job system in FFXIV:ARR is in place to provide a fairly simple service to the players. That is


To begin illustrating HOW the class/job system works we will assume that I am playing the game as a Pugilist. I gain levels through quests and combat among other things, my Pugilist can equip 4 cross-class abilities. Cross-class abilities are abilities that can be slotted by classes other than the class that learns them. So by way of the Armory System, let us also assume that I leveled Conjuror and Lancer both to 15. My level 20 Pugilist can slot 4 cross-class abilities from those to classes to compliment the Pugilist’s own abilities. Lets say I slot Protect and Keen Flurry. This means that Pugilist can use the Conjuror ability ‘Protect’ and the Lancer ability ‘Keen Flurry’.  I have 2 empty cross-class slots that I can fill with cross-class abilities from any other class I have leveled. I can even slot more abilities from the same class, like Conjuror’s ‘Cure’. You can extrapolate this system all the way to level 50. At level 50 my Pugilist has 10 cross-class slots that can be filled with any cross-class abilities available from any other classes I have leveled. 


Before we move on with the HOW, which increases play time. The other reason is that this system boosts the versatility of classes, making solo play less punishing. Through cross-class abilities all classes have access to healing, damage-dealing, sustaining, and defensive abilities. If a player wanted to run some minor content solo (dungeons and such REQUIRE a party) then this system facilitates that by giving the player access to the full gamut of necessary skills.  


Lets move on with the HOW. Eventually


**To clarify; in order to qualify for a series of job quests you must have the PRIMARY CLASS to LEVEL 30


 In the case of Monk, one of my rewards is an item. I’ll call the job souls because I can’t recall the technical name (somebody please help me with that). This particular job-soul, the Soul of the Monk, is only equipable by my Pugilist. Once equipped, the item confers various stat boosts and a separate pool of attribute points to allocate. Another effect of equipping a job-soul is a change in the number and type of cross-class slots. While a job is equipped you are only granted one cross-class slot every **TEN** levels, effectively reducing the number of available slots by half. Furthermore, you can only slot abilities from two specific sub-classes. In the case of Monk in ARR these subclasses are Lancer and Gladiator. This means that I can continue to slot ‘Keen Flurry’, job quests award five job specific abilities unique to that job. On top of all this


This was a bunch of information, party play would feel like a potluck mishmash of same-y characters. Everybody would have access to cure and raise and second wind and invigorate, and party roles would blur into nothingness. With jobs, every person in the party has a role to play, and their class is designed and buffed to excel at that role, at the sacrifice of versatility. One of the concerns I see pretty frequently is that there is not enough diversity between people of the same class, or even between the class and that class’s job. I think these concerns come out of a misunderstanding of the class/job system. Players of the same job all feel the same and all jobs feel extremely similar to the base class for a reason; because the list of available jobs is not yet complete.  Lets go back to the HOW to illustrate what I mean. 


Our current list of classes has been carried over from 1.0. Jobs were implemented in the restructuring of 1.0 to showcase where the new development team was headed and to facilitate more party-centric gameplay. Now that we are on the verge of ARR, and the two jobs are Summoner and Scholar. Because I believe these elements have been fairly adequately explained by the developers, I can tell you how I think the class/job system will work in the future. Arcanist will gain access to it’s jobs in the same fashion we talked about earlier, though there will likely be a separate quest line for each job and different sub-class requirements.


 To give a bit of reference, it is likely that the number and effectiveness of its DoTs will increase, making its role more DPS than Support. The developers have said the Scholar job will grant Heal over Time abilities to the Arcanist, likely pushing the role of the class to Heal/Support rather than offensive/support. 


If you take this same job system and apply it to the rest of the list of classes, so does the amount of diversity in the player community. Pugilist will get a second job that operates slightly differently than Monk, likely even changing the function of some base abilities (like the Elemental Fist stances). Additional classes will be added to the Armory System to accommodate other unaccounted for weapon styles and jobs. 


Now another concern that often pops up, a number of people claim to be upset at the prospect of being unable to experience the leveling up process of a job when the sister job has already reached max level. For example, if you were to level Arcanist to 30 and get the appropriate sub-job to unlock Scholar, then continue to level Scholar to 50, your Summoner would also be level 50 despite having never equipped the job-soul. While I can understand the reason most people find this upsetting, I think that they miss the point of the system. 


**JOBS DO NOT GAIN LEVELS!**


This is imperative in understanding the function of the system. If we go back to our HOW then WHY format, and Cross-Class Restrictions. To signify to yourself and other players that you have this gear equipped, your designation changes from class name to job name. You shift from a level 50 Pugilist to a level 50 Monk. The level does not change because jobs are independent to level and the level is irrelevant to the job. Even the Unique Job Abilities are independent of level. The reason they have a level attached to them is because you must be a specific level to accept the quest that awards them. I will repeat; **JOBS DO NOT GAIN LEVELS**.


And now I will explain WHY. Jobs are designed to be specializations. It is confusing because currently, and it is simpler to call yourself a Monk than a Pugilist/Monk. This is where more diversity comes from. Two players can play as Arcanist but be diverse because one specializes in DoTs with Summoner, and the other specializes in HoTs with Scholar. This will eventually happen with all classes. Jobs serve as Final Fantasy flavored tech-trees (that you can freely switch between). Later, when the level cap is bumped up, the differences between sister-jobs will increase as they gain more job abilities and cross-class slots.  


This is HOW the class/job system works


**THIS ENDS MY EXPLANATION** 


In my opinion, I think certain class abilities that bleed into a job, like the Elemental Fists the pugilist has, need to undergo a function shift when a different Pugilist job is released. It would seem silly to have fists of earth and wind without fists of fire (a Monk exclusive). So if those abilities change to different abilities on a different job I think that would go a long way to making this system successful. As an example if Pugilist gained the Dancer job, then those elemental fist abilities could change to dances while you have the dancer job equipped. The same would work for Arcanist, and this would be when we could determine if they are going this route. While you are Arcanist, you have a Summon Ruby Carbuncle and a Summon Diamond Carbuncle ability. Since you can’t summon Carby while playing as either Summoner or Scholar


Anyway


tl;dr: Yes you did. Don’t lie.

I realize the whole ""it's only beta"" thing was one of the reasons FFXIV 1.0 failed (yeah, I said it) but when people are flat out critical about things that

* A: have been specifically talked about by Yoshi P
* B: are explained in the beta test road map
* C: could be easily understood by reading the info posts on the beta forums

...and then take their ridiculous thoughts to the uniformed masses as a critique of the final product....I don't know

**TLDR:** Anyone else upset about the amount of NDA breaking by people who really don't understand what they're talking about?  I think SE has done a great job of being transparent as far as their goals and intentions here

**edit:** Maybe I should've been more clear or something

**more thoughts:**   Since this thread is getting way more exposure than I thought it would

My opinion is that we shouldn't have ANY opinions yet because no matter how any of us feels about anything we've seen in the game so far

We have no idea how ANY of these seemingly disparate systems intertwine because we have yet to see the big picture. Don't like the combat? Well maybe you will after you see limit breaks and have more classes to pick from. Don't like the enclosed spaces of Gridania? Maybe it works as a contrast to the open air of Limsa. See what I'm getting at? Our view of this game is so narrow that quite literally having any opinion at all at this point (and I'd argue even up until beta phase 4) just makes us all

We aren't playing

A comparison, I surely don't want to play a game where all you do is swim all the time."" Again, do you see what I'm getting at? It's about the bigger picture. And quite frankly, we don't know what that picture is yet.

**TLDR (pt2):** Everyone needs to **STFU** about their personal feelings (be they good or bad) towards things until we have a more solid understanding of the game as a whole.  We're not playing, *knowing* how *ignorant* we all are to how the game actually works...then there's a place for you.  The feedback threads in the beta forum.

A bit info about me and why I'm doing this is below here.

If you would like to play with me

For those interested, and gave 21 away during version 1.0. I only barely played the first free month because I felt the game was very, let's say, stale and dull. I had built up too much hype for the title, as I am doing once again for ARR, however the game didn't deliver what I hoped for.

As a fan of Square Enix and their Final Fantasy series I just wanted to share their game with some other people who was interested in the title. I stopped handing out copies because I didn't want other people to feel like I did
I want people to play the game and most of all
 
As the legacy campaign was getting to its end I though that maybe I could get it by telling Square Enix about this, a cactuar plush or whatnot. I don't own anything special made by them, exept most of the Final Fantasy games!

Many of those I gave my keys to during 1.0 didn't have a computer capable of running the game

Please give me some time to reply

EDIT 1: I have now handed 3 games out. I will wait for more entries before I start handing them out again!

EDIT 2: If you'd like to watch my box of games and once in a while see my hand grab one

EDIT 3: 10 copies got a new owner now! I will wait for more entires before I start handing them out again!

EDIT 4: I've decided to hand out 10 copies each day until beta phase 4 starts. You are still able to enter the giveaway but there won't be any winners until tomorrow! Congratulation to all the winners today! Also

EDIT 5: I've noticed that one of the winners has removed their enrty, even if you delete your entry I have noted your name down so you won't be able to enter the giveaway again!

EDIT 6: The stream is up again and I will start giving some keys away in about 10 min! Check EDIT2 for info about the stream.

EDIT 7: Todays giveaway has ended! I will start the next one tomorrow at [4pm/16:00 GMT+2](http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/time-zone/europe/european-union/sweden/) I'd also like to apologize to all day 1 winnners. I noticed that the links in my PM were outdated. I've updated my PM so the new winners won't get as confused as the first ones probably got! These should be the correct links: [Exclusive Square Enix Member signup](
https://membership.square-enix.com/register) and [Square Enix EU account site](http://eu.square-enix.com/en/seaccount)

EDIT 8: The giveaway for 13/08 is over. The next one will be 14/08 at 4pm/16:00 - 5:30pm/17:30 GMT+2.

EDIT 9: Today's giveaway

**1)** Go to ""My Games"" folder. It's in ""My Documents""

**2)** Go to ""Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn (Beta Version)"" Folder
______________________________________________

[Now

The Folder **""4AXXXXX""***, Keybinds, Hotbar Action Layout and Gear Sets are location. You get multiple of these folders for each character you have.

The Folder **""FFXIV_CHRXXXXX""**

The Files **""FFXIV_CHARA_BETA0x.dat""** which are boxed in Blue are my Character Creation files which I can import when creating a new character.

The 6 numbers at the end of the folder ""4A"" represent your character ID. This ID is also the same as the last 6 numbers of your ""FFXIV_CHRXXXXX"" folder. So these two folders are linked together. This may prove difficult to find out which Character ID goes with which one of your characters (if you have multiple).

(*for example

**NOTE**:  You may have **01**XXXXXX instead of **4A**XXXXXX. The first two letters/numbers are server related *
______________________________________________

**3)** Go into folder **""4AXXXXX""**

Now you'll see a bunch of new .dat files. I'll list what each one does

* addon.cnf - **THIS IS YOUR UI/HUD LAYOUT FILE** If you want to use your existing HUD/UI layout

* gearset.dat - This lists all of your gearsets and what items are currently in the sets

* hotbar.dat - This all of the actions which are on your hotbar. This will save the layout of your actions on your hotbar

* keybind.dat - This is fairly obvious. Its your keybinds. What button does what command

* macro0.dat - I don't know if you can get many macro files

______________________________________________

So if you want to back-up your entire UI layout

What you'd want to do is go into your desired characters folder

* addon.cnf
* every file inside the folder ""FFXIV_CHRXXXXX""

You can also transfer these files to your other characters.

Enjoy your remaining last few hours of P3 and get ready for Open Beta/Phase 4!

**NOTE**: It's important to back these up as we will be using a new client for FFXIV:ARR. If you want to keep everything for P4

Like everyone else in this subreddit

The circlejerk hype-train always rolls on by a new MMO project and quickly leaves as it endlessly looks for that same feeling it got from its first MMO experience X years ago (*we are all guilty of this*). For the first time in a long time however

For a bit of backstory

What greeted me was without a doubt the worst MMO experience I have ever had. I put it down 25 minutes later

Square Enix burnt me so badly I never even considering going back

That being said

* Square Enix knows its development team screwed up royally with 1.0. It not exactly everyday when a company fires pretty much all of its development team

* The expenditure required of the point above means that they really need to make sure this is a game that can justify its asking price. The fact they are **so quiet** about its marketing to me says they are very confident they have a product that appeals to it's demographic that will sustain and justify its ongoing costs. *And from what I've seen so far I have to agree.*

* Square Enix seem insanely humble about the failings of 1.0. How often do you have publishers openly admit their mistakes?

* Naoki Yoshida and his team are a breath of fresh air from the stuffy shirts from other MMO's. They're down to earth and have no qualms praising elements from other games for their inspiration and ideas. Have you ever heard of Blizzard or Trion praising other for its elements that it lifted from it?

* The game is social! It sounds stupid considering how obtuse and clunky the chat system is, or make your own. If you want to be a introvert, you don't have to do any of it. 

* They have openly and frankly detailed the game design plan and implementation going forward. This is a wait and see kind of thing if they are actually going to stick with it but it means you know exactly what you are getting this time around and any deviation or back flipping on this will be met with open anger and losing its community. Points 1 &amp; 2 seem to infer they can't afford to do this.

* Besides the first 10-15 levels

All in all I think that its upfront design nature

The mentality nowdays from publishers seems to be that it has to be ""#1 or go F2P"". Marketing teams tend to overplay their game features or make just utterly insane claims about how their games will redefine the MMO market and how it will bring world peace etc etc. 

**What makes ARR so brilliant is that its not aiming to be #1 or to change the industry

**TL:DR** ARR isn't going to bring the *WoW crowd*

I'm writing this not just to explain to those people that their complaint is wrong and just to give an overview of DPS mechanics and buttons. But also to give a small primer in how to become good at DPSing in General. In order to do this

---

I'm a subscriber to the school of thought that it's better to give theory and have people 'discover' the proper playstyle through trial and error

**Playing a DPSing Class Effectively**

This really only comes down to two things: Survival and Total Damage Done.

Ironically

In order to DPS well your first job in a raid or any encounter, use defensive cooldowns, just stop DPSing if you're going to die. Just stop. Walk away from the monster. But muh numbers! No. Shut up. Don't die.

In order to improve the second aspect, the cost of it, the cooldown, and ask yourself these questions. Why did the developers give me this skill? Where should I be positioned? What if I used this one instead? Am I sitting on dead air? If you can reason through these questions and look at your DPS priorities in this way, I can tell you you're already better than 80% of the people that simply look up a rotation and press those buttons mindlessly.

Now to get to the meat of what I said earlier

**An Overview of Kickpunching

Like every class/job in FF14, altering your active abilities and so on. Let's take a look at the PUGs active abilities.

---

**Bootshine** - Lv.1 - Cast Time: Instant - Recast Time: 2.5 

Delivers an attack with a potency of 130.

Opo-opo Form Bonus: Critical damage if dealt from behind target

**Additional Effect: Changes form to raptor**

Duration: 10s

---

&gt;Hold the phone? What the fuck does that mean?

Alright this is the first step down into the depths of understanding how to DPS. A lot of the active abilities of the PUG makes her switch forms. There are **three** different forms to switch around in; **Raptor, Bootshine itself gains the ability to have 100% crit **IF** you are both BEHIND the target, and in Opo-Opo form. Sadly, since Bootshine is usually our starter ability until the rotation gets goin, your first Bootshine will usually be not of the 100% crit variety.

---

**True Strike** -Lv.2 -Cast Time: Instant - Recast Time: 2.5

Delivers an attack with a potency of 150. Chance for critical damage increases by 5% when dealt from behind target. Can only be used when in raptor form.

Additional Effect: Changes form to coeurl

Duration: 10s

---

&gt;The second piece of the puzzle

Bootshine leads us to Raptor Form, Bootshine gives us Raptor and this can only be cast in Raptor. Hmm but this doesn't give us opo-opo to take full advantage of Bootshine's properties. Let's keep looking

---

**Featherfoot** - Lv.4 - Cast Time: Instant - Recast Time: 90.0s

Increases evasion by 15%.
Duration: 10s

---

&gt;Defensive Cooldowns

Our first defensive skill. This isn't kickpunching at all! However, lesser mortals can't keep threat off you. Use this to survive in those occasions. Or maybe sometimes you just fuck up.

Another way to think about it is this. Raid encounters are tuned around your Healers' mana bar VS the raid's overall DPS. The less burden your healers have to brunt

---

**Snap Punch** - Lv.6 - Cast Time: Instant - Recast Time: 2.5

Delivers an attack with a potency of 140. Potency of 180 when delivered from a target's flank [from the side].

Can only be used when in coeurl form.

Additional Effect: Changes form to opo-opo
Duration: 10s

Additional Effect: Grants Greased Lightning

&gt;Out of the pan and into the fire; The Early level Triple Combo

We have now leveled to level 6 and we have our first 'rotation'. If you want the easy answer: Bootshine -&gt; True Strike -&gt; Snap Punch -&gt; Bootshine -&gt; True Strike -&gt; Snap Punch etc etc. Read the skills again and it's really easy to see WHY we do this. However

&gt;Greased Lightning

Greased Lightning is what is usually called a 'priority buff'. You want to keep the uptime of this ability up as much as possible. At level 20 you unlock the passive ability to keep 2 stacks up

The priority is actually pretty easy at this point

I really want to write more of this but I actually have to leave for a bit right now. I would hold off on posting this right away

1372726437.0,1hgr7l,Dragoon : Phase 3 - Some things you could know and my thoughts.,Eliroo,99,22,62,"Ok my second and last post for the night - Dragoon. This is the one battle class that I probably spent the least amount of time on. Though I did spend time on it

There isn't really anything I was disappointed in when it came to DRG so I will just list some of the good things I found and give you guys some tips.

* **Heavy Thrust / Feint / Straight Shot** - These are the few standalone skills that I found out to be really great. I know Straight Shot is from the ARC tree but I find it necessary to mention it and how it should be on every DRG's bar. Heavy Thrust is LNC's answer to Twin Snakes and the duration of the buff gets boosted to 15 seconds later on making it a must in your rotation. Feint is another skill that needs to be pointed out - I don't know the full effects of a 20% Slow but I'm sure it can't be a bad thing. Feint won't always be ""required"" but I feel it will definitely be important in your decision making.

* **The Full Thrust Combo** - This combo is mindlessly easy to pull off. Really its just a 1-2-3 button push and bam! 300 Potency skill. I feel like the simplicity in this combo is a must considering all the actions you can pull off in between skills.

* **Chaos Thrust Combo** - This will probably be the first combo that you pull off in a single target fight. All you have to do is land Impulsive Drive in the back (I hate talking about DRG combo's makes me feel weird...) and Disembowel /Chaos Thrust can be performed anywhere. This whole combo does a good bit of damage

* **Jump / Spineshatter Dive / Dragonfire Dive / Elusive Jump** - Jumping! Wouldn't be a FF dragoon without jumping! And they sure do give you a lot of them. Actually all your DRG skills involve jumping. While at first they may seem underwhelming they all cost no TP and all of them are off the GCD

* **Power Surge/ Life Surge** - Power Surge will make your next Jump / Spineshatter Dive deal more damage. Obviously this skill is best used on Jump and it times up perfectly to boost every third jump. Life Surge is a DPS skill and a life saver

* **Leg Sweep** - I think this skill is best saved for whenever a boss is charging a skill since interrupts are priceless but in an all out DPS race keeping this on CD isn't a bad idea. 3 seconds worth of stun is priceless towards the end of fights

* **Invigorate/ Blood for Blood** - Invigorate restore 450 TP at level 36 meaning that when your TP drops below 550 Use it!!!! You can easily make it the end of fights faster if this skill is used properly. I found on DRG Tp problems were a myth (Though I'm sure in 10+ minute fights it would become a problem =P). Blood for blood is another skill that is best paired with Full Thrust and Dragonfire Dive. When you use it be careful! I could only imagine a DRG with Blood for blood up and getting hit with a primals astral flow : (.


Quick Tips :

* Coming up with a solid combo for DRG is hard but I can at least get your brain thinking : **Straight Shot &gt; Impulse Drive ( Back ) &gt; Disembowel &gt; Chaos Thrust &gt; Heavy Thrust ( Side) &gt; True Thrust &gt; Vorpal Thrust &gt; Full Thrust.**

* Imo Dragoon's playstyle is a bit different than MNKS

* IIRC using a standalone GCD skill will break your combo link

* If you are AoE'ing Trash mobs Dread Spike is probably going to be your best bet but if you are AoE'ing mobs centered around a boss Heavy Thrust ( Side) &gt; Ring of Thorns will probably produce better results. DFD also makes a great AoE skill.


Overall:

I'm mostly happy with DRG in its current state because as it is you can easily just Spam the Full Thrust combo and be useful but again if you wanna be your best utilizing all of your tools is going pull you ahead. Dragoon definitely has a ""Fast Burn"" effect while Monk is more of a ""Slow Burn"" class and I'm really glad SE made them comparable but still different. I really feel DRG is in a really good place and I hope they change almost nothing about it : D.


Sorry if for the lack of information here


Hope this helped someone  - Lavi.

Here you go!

**Before reading

Well, now what do I do?"" Fret not testers for there is still a lot of untapped content that we need to help SE with!

First and foremost: Duty finder! Repeat those instances on your level 15s. Need to know how to get an instant level 15 DoW/M? http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1gubii/instant_level_15_on_jobs/

Get those jobs to 15 and try out classes you would never try and abuse that Duty Finder. Your info isn't going to save anyways so dont worry too much about your 35 not getting exp. Unlock the rest of those GHs and see what the heck to do. You never know

2) CRAFT

Now that you've had time to hunt a crazy amount of mobs you should of gathered a ton of crafting materials (pending you didn't sell them all). Not only that, sorry! (might have some costs associated), receive exp AND gain materials. 
Why craft? because it's going to be essential to this game. Instanced armor is great and all but crafted gear is still going to be a strong point when you can stack materia into it like a bauss. Another reason is that it'll give you a feel on how much time it'll take to get to a certain level. However

3) Gathering!

Ah yes
If Hamlets do make a return

4) Bug Report

The more bugs we submit the better. Most likely a lot of people have experienced bugs but haven't reported with the reasoning ""I bet someone's already done it"". Who Cares! Write it down anyways on Notepad or Google Docs, post it! Follow the post guidelines of course. Don't forget to take lots of pictures. Pictures are great evidence and they need all the evidence they can get. 

Lastly
5) EXPLORE

While a ton of areas are closed off, locate every zone.This will be a great way to plan your route for phase 4/open. If you can find xx NPC that'll sell xx item so you can craft xx, come p4 you can make your first few levels that much easier. 

Oh and I guess an extra/tidbit
6ish) Be Open

Use duty finder, come release you should be there to help fellow new adventurers out. Do not exclude them from the content. Yeah it can be easy saying ""google it"", but it's just as easy to say ""Central Thanalan 32-23"" if you know the answer. 

Remember

Take care Eorzians.

Producer/Director Yoshi-P here.

Thank you all so much for your feedback.
I'd first like to start off by apologizing for the heavy lag caused by the increased frequency of FATEs during our previous test. A majority of the problems with auto-attack not activating and position lag stemmed from this

Now then, so get comfortable, grab a cool drink, and prepare for a good read. In the future, I hope you guys keep what I cover in this post in mind as you continue to provide feedback.

■The Idea Behind FFXIV:ARR Battles and Content■
I've talked about concepts for the game's battle system and content in interviews before, so first I'd like to set some groundwork and clear up a few things. 

■Monsters and Their Role in the Game■
Rather than focusing on encounters with common enemies out in the field, bosses, and other content we're preparing for A Realm Reborn. At the end of the day, normal enemies seen running around outside the cities aren't meant to require a great deal of effort. In contrast, when facing a boss while trying to clear a dungeon, for example, we want players to give it their all and have a fun time doing so.

■FFXI and FFXIV■
When FFXI released on PlayStation 2 a little more than 10 years ago, and FFXIV will again be the first MMORPG experience for many console gamers. With this in mind, we designed the battle system based on three key principles.


- Playing in a party should not be necessary until level 15. This includes story-related events.
- Regardless of the learning curve
- The game's core design should allow for leisurely play over a long period of time.

Because there are so many things to remember and keep in mind when playing, perhaps, why some consider MMORPGs to be so interesting. 

■Perplexity
Many games on the market attempt to rationalize needlessly complicated game features with phrases like ""Dynamic Action!"" or ""Revolutionary Gameplay!"" but with FFXIV: ARR

- If players have a goal
- Players should not feel the need to avoid or sneak past enemies to enjoy any given content.

Considering players should be able to enjoy an MMORPG for months

Unlike games from other genres, your average player is younger now than when the first generation of MMORPGs were released. Nevertheless, players tend to be older due to the use of a subscription model. So when they come home from work or school and decide to play, even if it's only for an hour or two, they should be able to enjoy themselves. In other words, the use of mundane grinding for hours on end is no longer an effective means to stay competitive in the current MMORPG market.

Also

1. MMORPGs are based on the premise of party play.
2. If the game has a wide variety of exciting game elements
3. The over use of non-targeted / area of effect skills can result in bland gameplay.*
* Encounters meant to be challenging such as dungeons tend to become unbalanced.

Even now, we first eliminated the stress of needing to form a party in the beginning of the game, and by mid-game players will start to find more content that requires teamwork. By end-game, players should be fairly comfortable with the duty finder and accustomed to group play as they take on the more challenging content we have prepared. 

Although some may come to the conclusion that constant interaction with others can become tiresome in an MMORPG, and the lack of interaction with other players would detract from what it means to be an MMORPG. Mind you this is a comparison of one extreme to another (completely party focused versus solo play). In the end, an MMORPG is selective in its audience, which is both its strength and its weakness.

Regardless of how particular FFXIV: ARR may be in choosing its audience

This is where the remaining two aspects necessary for productive gameplay come into effect. But with so many games out on the market, but this is a given. As mentioned previously, however, no matter how hard one tries to attract new players, no MMORPG is capable of appealing to all audiences effectively. I personally believe an attempt to appeal to and retain every type of gamer effectively is too idealistic.

To speak specifically about game balance, and does not hinder party communication when playing through it. Moreover, there should be a variety of things to do to keep players interested. Gameplay should also have a steady pace, but not simply devolve into spamming weapon skills.

As many of you know, along with an assortment of quests and stories befitting a Final Fantasy title. For those of you concerned about a lack of challenging end-game content, if Version 1.0 is any indication, you can rest easy knowing there are fierce battles on the horizon. 

In short

■Research and Analysis■
The title of this section speaks for itself, people tend to concern themselves with sell-in and sell-through, but the longevity of an MMORPG depends on retention. This is why it's important to understand that game developers for online games always make their decisions based on retention rate. Because I'm a gamer myself, I also take time to play the game, as well as take feedback from players, which I believe is also very important.

This, but all aspects of the game. Whether it's a simple FATE against a wave of enemies, or a gritty battle against a powerful NM, offering players a variety of options to have fun is our goal.
(Speaking of FATE

FFXIV:ARR and the Battle System Part 2 (Another long read!)

Now that I've gotten the groundwork out of the way

■GCD and Planning Time■
The current implementation of the GCD (Global Cooldown) is a result of our aim to keep things simple while ensuring players can enjoy the game for a long time. Unfortunately for seasoned MMO players, and you guys haven't had a lot of time to really dig into the game yet, but as you progress in level, your characters will acquire a variety of skills to use in battle. This includes combos, weapon skill and action rotations, debuff skills, and crowd control skills. As you acquire more skills to use in battle

■Skill Rotations and Adjustments■
While our goal is for players to have access to more skill rotations as they level

Archer in particular has no actions that combo, this lack of combos and skill rotations is much more noticeable. Over the course of the beta test, we will continue to make adjustments to actions while taking in your feedback. 

■Auto-attack■
There's been a fair bit of debate as to what purpose auto-attack serves in ARR, one thing I can tell you is there are be no changes such as the use of auto-attack to restore TP.

It may be hard to tell when you experience the first dungeon at level 15, you will have to make smart choices with your skills to not only use TP and MP effectively, but to survive more dangerous encounters. In the event you do run out of MP and TP, however, you will still have auto-attack as a constant source of base damage. There are still more adjustments to be made, but in the meantime, your feedback is always welcome and appreciated.

■FFXIV is Like Poker?■
This may be a stretch

- There is little time where you will be sitting there doing nothing. (However
- You won’t start with a full hand
- As more cards are revealed (as you level up and acquire more actions/traits)
- Each weapon skill serves as a ""card
- You change your ""hand"" according to how a fight plays out (but you’ll always have time to think on your strageies).
- Limit breaks
- Auto-attack serves as one of your ""cards"" when all other options have been exhausted

This is the premise of the battle system. I know poker wasn't the best analogy to describe how the battle system will work

■PvP Actions■
When discussing the design of actions and weaponskills, realized this would create problems. For those who only play PvE, they would have no use for skills catered to PvP. In contrast, those who do play PvP would inevitably have too many to sort through. What we've decided to do is create two separate sets of skills for that players will have the freedom to interchange depending on whether they’re playing PvE or PvP. These PvP actions will be obtained through participation in PvP.

■Constantly Contradicting Elements■
Phew
- It's great when solo play is easy
- If you make a game simple
- If you make the game complex and action oriented

Unfortunately, a happy equilibrium between these three points must be met in order to make an enjoyable game. As we continue making adjustments and planning for the future, we are always mindful of our preferences for one idea over another, and we ask that you do the same, but don't worry about it too much. Leave the sleepless nights discussing designs and game mechanics to us (as well as the lag problems... We’ll working on those, I swear!)

Your feedback is vital to balancing the game, the developer's comments, and all the tester feedback in here, I realize there is a lot to read through, and I thank you all for taking the time to do it.

I can say with confidence that only FFXIV could receive so much feedback and support from around the world for a beta test that's only getting started.

Here's a list of things I've found. Discuss any others you've found too!

* Footsteps on different material - Very easy to test in somewhere like Limsa Lominsa where the material you're walking on can quickly change from grass to sand to stone to metal to wood to carpet. All are quite distinguishable.

* Environmental visual effects on appropriate attacks - I noticed this the first time I used the Marauder's Skull Sunder ability, there were no leaves for that attack!

* Dynamic lighting - In areas with multiple lights

* Weather effects - Self explanatory. It's simple but it adds so much to the atmosphere of a living world.

* Music changing instruments depending on the time of day / current weather conditions - This just adds so much more onto the previous point. Sunny weather has happy

* Location-sensitive SFX - If you have a weapon with a loud sheathe, the echo is no longer there and the sound effect produced feels much less cramped.

* Player-sensitive ambient noise - I didn't even realise this one until the last few moments of Phase 3. If there are a lot of other PLAYERS (read: Not necessarily NPCs) then you will have a lot of ambient voices  to give the feel of a lot of discussion in the area. If you move to a less crowded place

**Guidelines:**

* Should be original artwork you created for the subreddit.
* Related to FFXIV:ARR in some way.
* As high-resolution as possible (we can downsize if needed).
* Transparency (if any background) preferred.
* Submit it to us [via modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fffxiv) (upload it to a file share or image host).

**Example submissions we're looking for:**

* Icons (upvote/downvote
* Sidebar image (~300px width)
* Top header banner (~1300px width)
* The words ""reddit"" or ""/r/ffxiv"" in a FFXIV:ARR style.
* Overall subreddit background (large resolution)
* Anything else (reddit themed FFXIV characters

A sample image for the subreddit would be the current reddit alien Moogle in the upper-left corner. If you're not sure what kind of theme to make it

If you're not too talented with artwork (like me)

You can take a look at /r/diablo3 how many custom images were used to make a stylesheet

This nonsense needs to stop. You can still feel pride and accomplishment in raising your character without it taking over a year to reach cap. 


Having a long quest/keying process in order to reach end game content and struggling to find people who are actually keyed does not make end game content challenging.

1372969907.0,1hnjdc,Warrior : Phase 3 - Lavi babbling again. (Things to look forward too),Eliroo,81,18,29,"Hey guys it's Lavi again and today I want to cover the tanking paradigm of this game. I'm a big believer in the Holy Trinity

Note- I'm going to make this two posts

Things to get pumped about :

* **Defiance** : This is your first Warrior skill and right off the bat it lets you know that Warrior was designed to be a tanking class. It increases your HP by a straight 25% and drops your damage dealt by 35%. It also increases the enmity generated by each attack (This may be double like PLD, Second Wind( w/ Conv too), Mercy Stroke and Thrill of Battle. Obviously all of these spells now heal/ protect you for more. The fact that it gives you an enmity boost too makes performing your level 50 Warrior combo a bit easier without having to worry about hate issues as well. Again don't sweat the 35% damage chunk - You get plenty of things to make up for it. One of the things is the fact that every time you use certain skills you gain one stack of defiance and each stack gives you 2% Critical chance. At 5 stacks you become ""Infuriated"". I'll touch base on that in a bit.

* **Heavy Swing &gt; Maim &gt; Storms Eye** : I really love how SE gave Warrior their two damage buffs/debuffs all in the same combo. Maim will give you a 10% Damage boost and Storm's Eye will lower the targets Slashing resist by 10% and even lower their healing done by healing spells by 50%. That latter part may be extremely important in later dungeons so don't forget about it! Another note is that this combo will give you **1 Stack of defiance.**

* **Butchers Block Combo** : Your best damaging combo is also combined with your best enmity generation combo. This is extremely ideal and I really think SE wanted to give Warriors a break with this. This combo also provides you with **2 stacks of defiance.**

* **Unchained/ Inner Beast / Steel Cyclone** : Each of these skills require you to be infuriated, which helps with keeping hate in return. Pairing Berserk and Unchained together will give you 20 seconds of pure hard hitting damage. I can see this type of damage spike important in fights like Ifrit where taking out the Nail (Fetters) becomes very important. Inner Beast is another nice skill since it heals on a 1:1 ratio. On my warrior my Inner Beast was doing 230-280 damage regularly making this is a very nice healing effect. It is also good when Paired with Infernal Release  or Berserk to optimize the healing a bit. Steel Cyclone is definitely a shadow of its former self but that is a good thing. This is probably going to be best used in Boss fights or if you come across adds when you already have 5 Defiance stacks.

* **Infuriate** : This skill basically gives you 5 stacks of defiance. Now I can see this being used for a lot of things such as : Starting off the battle with unchained

* **Thrill of Battle / Mercy Stroke / Blood bath**: ToB is an excellent skill because not only is it an instant 20% Heal but it also boost your max hp by that much giving you some more wiggle room to survive strong attacks and it also *increases the potency of a WHM's stoneskin by 20%*. This is definitely an emergency skill and tell your whm when you use it! Mercy Stroke is a skill that is very potent to

* **Overpower / Fracture** : These two for sure get notable mentions as Overpower is a pretty strong and spammble AoE that also nets you a good amount of hate. Fracture will also deal a pretty hefty sum of damage in a long fight and considering that DoT's don't seem to be effected by damage boosts I wonder if they aren't effected by damage reduction.

* **Brutal Swing :** Another note worthy mention  - a 5s second stun not on the GCD with a 30 second CD? Wow...

Underwhelming Abilities :

* **Storm's Path** : Maybe its just me but at 100 Potency I don't feel like this skill is going to heal for a whole lot. Maybe it would be more viable at like ... 180~200 Potency?

* **Vengeance** : Joking

Some tips to go along with Warrior :

* I already mentioned this but - Communicate with your whm when you use ToB!

* There may be an interesting interaction with WHM/WAR since Warrior can heal themselves quite a bit and have a lot of HP I think they would make perfect candidates for stoneskin up keep. I'm thinking like - Let them take some damage

* Flash is cool and all but save it for when you need it

* Don't use Inner beast when you are full health

* Fights get harder at the end

* Warrior Combo'ing is pretty simple just rotate in between Storm's Eye and Butcher Block combo's with a Fracture thrown in when its needed and using Inner Beast / Steel Cyclone when you are infuriated.

* To get stacks of Defiance on your TP skills you have to use them properly in the combo. Also Berserk/ Thrill of Battle and a few others buff gives you stacks ( I don't have a full list on hand but it tells you in the description =p)

Going to skip the overall review part since I'm going to cover it when I Cover PLD ( Ha you get it?!)

1372071384.0,1gyn4i,Eorzea – Does it feel like a world? A Beta Observation,The_Inferiae,86,23,138,"Good day all

I’m here to talk to you about my experience in the latest beta

**Graphics**


*What it does well*

* The graphics in ARR are simply breath-taking, there’s a fantasy feeling to them without feeling too out of this world, Eorzea has this fantastic quality where one minute I’m slaying monsters in a faraway land yet at the end of it all can chill out in the local tavern and speak of our adventures over an ale.

* There’s an attention to detail that should not be overlooked, coming out a dark cave into the light makes the screen brighten and your retinas adjust, NPC’s that seem to have a purpose and a drive and many other small touches combined with the fantastic lighting engine in ARR and you have one of the most fantastic believable worlds I’ve seen in a long time.

*What needs work*

* Combat effects are fantastic but get a tad too much if too many people are involved

* My only real complaint currently is that the in game AA is incredibly poor, I forced it in the end through NVCP but it had a knock on effect of text appearing slightly blurred, hopefully this is addressed in the near future


**Animations**

*What it does well*

* Overall the world is well animated, this translates well into combat where you never feel tied down into actions, there’s a mild sliding issue when moving and using weaponskills, but I feel that the sacrifice is worthwhile for how fantastic they feel during combat, attacks feel weighty and playing mostly as a Lancer I felt my characters animations portrayed its weight and length well.

* Additionally the world is interactive and chairs and beds were all able to be sat and lied in which I believe is a small feature but pretty much essential for any game hoping to capture the RP crowd.

*What needs work*

* Currently the animations are in my view

* Firstly, you don’t stretch or scratch your elbow, you’re incredibly static, now I know this may not seem like much, but compare it to the last of us, Joel strokes his stubble, shifts his backpacks shoulder straps, it all adds to making your character feel believable

* I mentioned above that ARR has this fantastic setting where I feel I could walk into a tavern and discuss my adventures with the locals, characters don’t gesture or motion when they talk, and combining this with no speech bubbles makes towns feel lifeless, I’m in no way a WoW fan but they nailed this feeling, I lost count of the amount of times I’d join in conversations with strangers in that game around the towns and cities as I’d overhear them, and the subtle things such as ending a sentence with an exclamation mark changing the animation is fantastic, perhaps most importantly

* There’s also the issue of mouse turning not actually turning your character, currently it just looks incredibly cheap and I hope they animate the mouse turning as that’s what 90% of players actually use.

**Sound**


* I don’t even need ‘a what it does well and what needs work section’ here, the songs are classic FF songs that I found myself humming even after a few short hours, but most importantly, they’re not just good songs, but songs that sum up the area brilliantly, it’s not only the soundtrack that is so beautiful, crowded areas play ambient voices depending on how many players are present really helping areas feel alive.

* Combat sounds fantastic and with the excellent combat animations really make you feel like you’re inflicting serious damage to your opponent even in the early levels.

* Footsteps in a cave echo and give that sense that you’re all alone in isolation and you’re more than happy to hear the reassuring sound of a Chocobo’s chirp as you manage to stumble back into town


**Conclusion**

People dismiss us RP’ers as being a small bunch who shouldn’t really have a game tailored for them, if it all came down to combat, I’m fairly sure we’d all by playing Vindictus.

SE are on the brink of something special here, and the fantastic soundtrack that evolves with the time of day, but unless they implement some of the key features listed above such as chatting animations and bubbles and improved character animations when doing something as simple as turning, then Eorzea will be the most beautiful world that never let us love it.

But here's the funny thing; the only other FF game I've ever played was aaaages ago on the GBA remake of the first game

The game does a stellar job of melding the line between a personal story and multiplayer features without breaking up the gameplay or story (See WoW

The controls are responsive, oh man the soundtrack. It's far better than the single looped tracks in any other MMO I've played, the combat music especially and even the music changing from day and night. Did I mention the dark nights? I love 'em, WoW is still suffering from absurdly bright nights where everything just gets a slightly blue tint on it instead of being, well, NIGHT.

My only complaint is that it took quite some time before a quest introduced me to combat, Custom Robo DS, Lord of the Rings: The two towers on the PS2 and other games) to help hype me up for leveling. As is I seem to just be mashing one or two abilities over and over, then again, not much different from typical MMO's or RPG's, so I won't let that ruin my enjoyment and I'm sure it'll pick up later.

My other, get quest to kill X of Y/Gather X of Y, return to dude, repeat. The FATE's however break this up nicely and the overall presentation makes what would be considered generic kill quests much more enjoyable than they would be in WoW for example.

I haven't had a chance to try switching classes or anything yet


I would happily subscribe and buy this game on launch if I already had my allowance of cash being funneled into World of Warcraft. Say what you want about that game but I still love and enjoy it. But I'd be lying if I said XIV didn't tempt me, maybe pay for a month or two every so often. While I'd love it to go free to play, I can safely say that if you don't play WoW but don't mind paying a sub fee, you'll -definitely- be getting your Gil's worth here (See what I did thar?) and this is quite literally the first MMO besides WoW which I can look at and say ""This shouldn't be free to play.""

In 1.0 BRD was basically a support that could deal some damage

Anyways let's start with the good stuff:

* **Barrage** - I wanted to start with this one first because when I first saw the skill description I was like ""What place do auto-attacks have in a skill spammy game"" and it wasn't until I learned that AA's happen at set intervals regardless of what you are doing that I truly began to appreciate this skill. Basically even if you are shooting out skills like crazy you are still doing AA's even though it doesn't seem that way and Barrage triples your AA damage for 10 seconds (Roughly 2-3 hits) and that added damage is pretty amazing

* **Raging Strikes / Increased Action damage** - Holy mother of straight up damage boosting potential! Combine these with Blood for Blood and if you can't see an Archers damage potential then you need new glasses! I know you get Raging Strikes relatively early but when you consider at level 40 that you get a 20% boost in action damage passively, should always be on cooldown.

* **Heavy Shot / Straight Shot** - This is why I absolutely love this game

* **Venomous Bite/ Wind Bite / Blood letter** - If I had a nickel every time I was like ""Wow DoTs in this game are really amazing"" I'd probably only have one nickel ( Maybe 2 if you consider that time when I lapsed into WoW for 20 levels on a warlock). VB and WB will probably compose a good portion of your damage and you are encouraged to use it because of the River of Blood passive and Bloodletter. Bloodletter is another amazing and good feeling skill that you will be using every time its up( Use an action first to get the GCD spinning so you don't waste any moments). On a side note - River of Blood doesn't feel like it activates all that often.

* **Rain of Death** - The effect on this skill is priceless and only becomes more valuable with the more party members you have. Not only does it make a fight go faster but it makes a mob(s) hit smaller. Meaning you are saving your WHM MP with this skill! the 200 TP cost on it can be rather brutal though : ( .

* **Misery's End** - I love these types of skills


Ok Now the bad - 

* **Songs** - What 


*If I could change anything to make Bard more like an iconic bard I would probably scrap the MP cost on the songs and extend their range to 25-30 yalms.*


Just in case some people are wondering about how me and my ls mate played our level 50 BRDS :

Essentially you wanna start every fight off with a raw Straight shot to get you that Critical hit rate and then fire off Bloodletter while the GCD is spinning. Next you want to apply both Poisonous Bite and Wind Bite. Then you just use Heavy shot unless you get a combo proc and then use Straight shot. Use Bloodletter/Blunt Shot / Flaming Arrow whenever they are up inbetween GCD skill casts


Overall I'm really happy about BRD. I like how they feel as a DD class and they definitely fit the role nicely but I'm just not to keen on where SE is taking their support aspect.

I feel this edit is in need since I have been a bit harsh on the songs

* My use of the term ""useless"" may be exaggerated. Paeon is indeed useful and Ballad may have some small use somewhere. But I feel the songs are definitely lackluster and where as they should define the class as bard they really don't. In long fights you are maybe only restricted to about 1-2 minutes worth of song time and that will probably be towards the end when TP levels have all gone to nil.

Really enjoyed the content and a lot of the new dungeon mechanics. Thought I'd give a rundown of my impressions on the two tanking classes available in ARR.


A bit about me: I am a Legacy player on Hyperion that has Lvl 50 PLD and WAR. Tanking is my preferred party role


The primary difference between the two classes that I have felt thus far, and 30 dungeon runs and going out on my own to tackle level 45-50 monsters, seems to be that WAR is a much more ""active"" tank than PLD is. 


I say that with a bit of resignation, I have thus far found the play-style of WAR much more attractive.


The reason I say that WAR is more active is that it has a much more diverse spread of combos that allow for a wider range of decision making in the midst of battle. The bulk of its abilities are on the same Global Cooldown, forcing you to really consider when and where you want to activate your abilities. 


For example: During a lvl 30 dungeon run (Brayflox's Longstop) as WAR, since I was now the center of attention for 8 monsters, our healer had to go into spam healing on me to keep me alive. Simultaneously, I used my Foresight (20% defense increase for 20 seconds), activated Bloodbath (convert 25% of skill damage to hp for 15 seconds), and activated Berserk (20 second 30% attack increase, unable to use weapon skills for 5 seconds after effect fades) . This let me hit 8 monsters at the same time for increased damage and heal back some hp for all 8 hits on every Overpower, while keeping myself alive from the healing on Overpower + Bloodbath. As soon as the first enemy was about to die, and I switch back to my standard 3 skill enmity combo. 


The number of chains and combos for Maurauder only increases further as you level up and change to Warrior (Heavy Swing &gt; Maim &gt; Storm's Path for healing OR Storm's Eye for additional damage)


As a PLD, mp is not a huge priority. 3. The presence of a BRD in your party or Ethers in your inventory will significantly alleviate MP issues. 


Most of PLD's other skills are not on the Global Cooldown, cover (useful primary in situations when enmity spread is bad), and Spirits Within (An additional attack not on GDC that should be used every 30 seconds for additional dps, though could be saved for the 1 second silence effect?)


What this essentially boils down to is a class that is relatively passive, may become somewhat stagnant in the hands of experienced players. 


In addition, it is the opposite, with WAR's on GDC and PLD's not. 


DoTs are easy to work into a skill rotation, simply fit it into the middle of two combo chains to refresh the effect. Circle of Scorn, while Area of Effect and costing no TP, has a recast longer than the effect duration, and really does not benefit well from not being on the GDC (since PLD has only one other Area of Effect move: Flash). Seeing as how PLD is already considered a ""Single target tank"", Circle of Scorn loses a lot of functionality in the very fights that PLDs are supposed to excel in. 


Stun, and is essentially something that is saved till you see a move that needs to be stunned. The PLD stun takes a hefty TP amount (150) and is on GDC, which means using it will interrupt your DPS chain combo, and cannot be used if you just used another skill. This makes the PLD stun both harder to time for moves that have narrow windows to stun AND unappealing to use from a damage output perspective. In addition, the benefit of being able to ""spam stun"" is heavily mitigated by the enemies' increasing resistance to stun over a short period of time and shield bash's high TP cost. 


All of the factors listed above contributes to a feeling of the WAR ""living in the now"", using the same combo pretty much all of the time, and having relatively little synergy between its skills aside from activating them when you simply want to take less damage, and having no drawbacks to think of like in the case of Berserk. Couple this with the naturally higher Damage output from MRD, and PLD begins to look a bit lacking. 

I understand that the two classes are constructed differently, and using a Rage of Halone for increased damage from behind was very satisfying. If PLD is supposed to be the ultimate single target tank, then there should be abilities that really boosts its performance when focused on one target. 

This is not to say that PLD will be ineffective compared to WAR or that WAR is OP or too good. However, it seems that WAR is simply more dynamic and engaging to play.


Anyhow

~~Also


TLDR version: PLD seems somewhat stagnant and lacking in variety/adaptability compared to the WAR playstyle. ",self,t5_2rgs7,1372110177.0,,limsa,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1gxjh0/tanking_impressions_in_arr_comparisons_of_the/

1372717424.0,1hgfxw,Monk : Phase 3 - Things to look forward to and my thoughts!,Eliroo,82,24,56,"Ok so today I thought I would cover Melee DPS

Things to look forward too :

* **Bootshine** - Let's start with this skill

* **Dragon Kick / Twin Snakes** - I decided to mention these two skills together because they are both pretty core to a MNKs DPS abilities. Maintaining the Dragon Kick Debuff on heftier targets is pretty important when trying to increase your single target damage. Dragon Kick makes for a great opener on any mobs. One thing I couldn't really confirm, Twin Snakes, not only does this skill hit from the flank pretty well it also gives you a pretty big damage increase (10%!) making this another important move in your first combo.

* **Greased Lightning** - How could I not mention this buff? Keeping three stacks of this buff is important and maybe even crucial to increasing your overall DPS(21% Damage and 15% AA speed and GCD reduction). It isn't that hard to maintain in a stand still fight since if you are combo'ing right you will always end up in couerl stance and every couerl stance move gives you the buff. I can see this buff hard to maintain in more active fights

* **Perfect Balance** - This buff has one core role in my opinion - Greased Lightning Stacks. Using this at the start of a fight and quickly using Demolish / Snap Punch / Snap Punch will net you the three GL stacks that you need to start pounding away at an enemy. It can also be used when you lose your GL stacks maybe from having to deal with boss interactions or from having to dodge for a long period of time.

* **Fist of Fire/Wind/Earth** - There isn't much to say about these. Obviously FoF will be your main go-to spell but considering Monks can use Provoke/Flash Earth doesn't seem like a bad option for off tanking and taking hits from primal astral skills. Fist of Wind also seems incredibly useful

* **One Ilm Punch**  - I could be wrong

* **Steel Peak** - At level 38 you finally get something comparable to leg sweep

* **Enhanced Mantra** - This also is an important skill to have. When fights get tough the healing needed gets tougher


A few things I'm not to keen on :


* **Touch of Death** - Monk gets two DoT's spells that hit relatively hard (Though according to Valkky they aren't effected by damage increases). Demolish is one hitting for a total of 240 Potency and Touch of Death is the other hitting for a potency of 270. Touch of Death is probably the strongest ability that a Monk has in their arsenal but what could my problem be with it? To me it just feels disconnected. Monk thrives off of their Opo-Raptor-Couerl form rotation and their ability to keep Twin Snakes and GL III up and Touch of Death really finds no place anywhere in that rotation. Every skill serves some purpose and is connected but this one. I can definitely see a good use for this ability but I wish either A) It was connected to the combo chain or B) It was off the GCD. Honestly when you are running from the Flank to the back of the mob and trying to maintain everything this skill doesn't really have a place in the GCD and I feel like it goes to waste : (. 

* **Howling Fist** - This skill's animation is awesome! Its damage isn't to bad either and the hit radius is nice. I only have one ""Complaint"" - the 300 second CD. I just don't understand why


Somethings I learned by tinkering with my level 50 Monk:

* Always know how to take advantage of your skills positioning bonus'! And always do it!
* When fighting big Mobs (Like Cancer) don't run a full circle around them
* From my findings the best single target Damage rotation is something like: **Dragon Kick (Flank) &gt; Twin Snakes (Flank) &gt; Demolish &gt; Bootshine ( Back ) &gt; True Strike ( Back ) &gt; Snap Punch (Flank ) &gt; Dragon Kick (Flank)** and repeat from there changing out Snap Punch for Demolish when the DoT needs to be refreshed. Use Blood for Blood when you are on the bootshine part of the combo and Infernal Release before you use True Strike for best results (Imo).
* Adapt your combo
* AoE'ing is easy
* Set **Invigorate and use it the moment you get below 700 TP!** The more you can use it the less TP problems you will have later.




My Overall thoughts:

Its true that in this game you can probably close your eyes and mash the 1-2-3 buttons and be effective to some extent but if you truly want to meet your potential mastering Monk can take some time but really be fun. I've spent the most time on PBE using my PUG/MNK and I have had a blast. Not only do you have to be aware of your buff timers


I hope this helped people or got them thinking!

The only thing that wasn't really gone into was how to get to the overclocking values there were supplied for Luna's video card - or if you have another card what you can use.

The first piece of software we are going to need is MSI Kombustor. You can download this for free from [**here**](http://event.msi.com/vga/afterburner/download.htm). It comes paired with the MSI Afterburner as well

I like to bring everything up so I can look at it all at once. You should have something like **[this](http://imgur.com/RUq3ZL2.jpg)** on your screen (you can ignore CPUZ in my screenshot

The first thing you should do is run a stress test on MSI Kombustor - put **[these](http://imgur.com/IortHJQ.jpg)** settings on (set the resolution to whatever yours is). What we are going to be doing is running a stress test on your base settings to see how much room you have to work with in terms of the temperature your card runs at. I would turn this on and let it run for at least 15 minutes. That being said, but those can be fairly hard to find sometime. I am not familiar with laptop video cards, so I really recommend looking up those temp ranges - my safe temps for desktop cards may or may not be valid on a mobile card.

After you figure out you how warm your card runs when being taxed, Nvidia Inspector or AMD Catalyst) to make small increments to your core clock or memory clock - and then stress test again to see what temps you hit, and then adjust accordingly. Make sure you hit apply after you make your changes - the bars are not a real time representation of what speeds you card is at. Also, set the power limit to 20%. All this does is allow your card to draw more power as you slowly increase the clock speeds (Which it will need!).

Another step you can take to get more out of your card is setting up a fan curve. Click the settings button **[here](http://imgur.com/FIkw7Tl)**. From there

You can manipulate how fast the GPU fan will run at what tempatures with this

I got fairly lucky as my card was extremely easy to overclock - I have a good case and play in a fairly cold room so I was able to turn everything to max. With a full gpu load for 45 minutes I max out at 77c. [**This**](http://imgur.com/U4H7mOE) is what my final settings look like.

1372810443.0,1hj85h,EDEN of Gilgamesh Official Recruiting Announcement (Full Details Inside) starting Phase 4~Rocs Lock,Rocslock,135,81,203,"Greetings

First I would like to thank everyone for taking the time to read this post. I am officially announcing to Reddit that the **EDEN** free company will be recruiting casual/hardcore players for FFXIV on the **Gilgamesh** server with events starting around the times of 8/9PM EST.  This is a non-legacy server meaning this server is brand new and everyone will be starting out equally.

Our goal is not to race to the finish line and rack up server firsts
[Original Video Annoucement](http://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_781342&amp;feature=iv&amp;src_vid=rf7efN9nwBQ&amp;v=eHunyCu7DS0)


**Our rules are simple and easy

* We will not tolerate discrimination of any kind based on *race*, or *sexual* orientation. 
* Members of **EDEN** should go out of their way to make others feel welcome.
* We will not tolerate trolling or disruptive behavior on the **Gilgamesh** server from our members to any *outside* players in other Linkshells and Free Companies.

**Our goals are as follows:**

* **Phase 4**

During Phase 4 the officer staff will be actively monitoring all recruits. Once we near the official release; (within a few days)

* **First Month**

We will continue to monitor the company

*  **Second Month**

A stricter application process will be instituted at this time. By this point our first raid team should be assembled or close to. We will also have begun assembling a second raid team for players interested in a more casual experience.

* **Third Month**

By this time we should be raiding two to three times a week. Spots available on raids teams will first be offered to the veteran and more skilled members of the company. Keep in mind that if you earn a spot on a raid team you will not lose it unless you begin to show lack of concentration or commitment to showing up on time.
If you like what you have been reading or are at all interested; come on over to our forum and fill out an applications. Spots are filling up fast so be sure to knock it out!
Thanks everyone who made it through this long post and see you on **Gilgamesh**!

1373978604.0,1ierax,Enmity Tidbits &amp; Some Flash Testing,kestiel,58,9,28,"These are mostly things I haven't seen around elsewhere that I was able to test and confirm. Nothing massively ground-breaking but again

&gt;**PLD/GLA Enmity Modifiers**

* **Savage Blade:** 3x DMG
* **Shield Lob:** 3x DMG
* **Rage of Halone:** 5x DMG


&gt;**Abilities**


* **Quelling Strikes:** -50% Enmity Generated
* **Elusive Jump:** -50% Current/Total Enmity (Elusive Jump will lower the enmity generated by Quelling Strikes @ -75%)


&gt;**Enmity Tidbits**


* First hit / aggro does not generate extra enmity. The misconception likely stems from people hitting the same enmity as the first attacker

* Critical hits *do not* generate additional enmity besides their higher damage. 

&gt;I saw this a few times, turn and let a low level job w/ broken weapon hit it until it turns. If their damage equals yours +1 when it turns, you can be also be sure crits don't generate hate. Keep in mind that activating abilities while engaged grants enmity and this can skew results. So be sure to activate internal release then use straight shot on a different mob to get a total of 30% buff on a non-MNK. Otherwise you risk skewing the results, which is where I think the belief started. I did the above test and it showed no difference.

* Missed attacks generate 0.5 points of Enmity.

* As a follow-up, while three misses (1.5E) will still equal 1 point of enmity unless there happens to be another action that garnered a 0.5E or greater.

* Damage from DOT ticks **are** affected by Shield Oath. I did not test Defiance


&gt; **On Flash**

* I could not find any conclusive proof that Flash's blind proc gives additional enmity. I adjusted my stats vs another PLD's stats of the same level so that we had completely equal stats save for one point of STR off. We knew that at 289STR Flash's enmity ticked up (my 288 vs his 289 made the mob turn to him when he flashed after mine). So I took 287STR and he took 288 assuming the blind proc would push him over. I flashed first which landed a blind proc

* Additionally, the less Enmity appears affected by STR. I did minimal testing with 5D and 10D weapons and plotted the enmity by changing STR 10pts up or down from 203 to 283, and the enmity value from STR ranged from a low of 0.2E per STR (from 213-223 Enmity changed from 151E @203STR to 153E @213STR).

Here are the values I was able to find with a bit of testing. I plan on going back and revisiting this when there's more time to try and determine exactly what's going on. But it looks a bit more complicated than the original formula gave it credit for. Either that or I'm incredibly terrible at math


The values are as follows Weapon Damage/STR/DTR = Enmity (Enmity per STR since the last enmity value)

* 10/283/202 = 185E (0.2E/STR)
* 10/273/202 = 183E (0.2E/STR)
* 10/263/202 = 181E (0.5E/STR)
* 10/253/202 = 176E (0.5E/STR)
* 10/243/202 = 171E (0.8E/STR)
* 10/233/202 = 163E (0.5E/STR)
* 10/223/202 = 158E (0.5E/STR)
* 10/213/202 = 156E (0.2E/STR)
* 10/203/202 = 154E (0.2E/STR)


[This is what it looks like if you plot them based on the Enmity gained per point of Strength.](http://i.imgur.com/h3qff3K.jpg)


[This is what it looks like if you plot Strength and Enmity out](http://i.imgur.com/RAwlyMG.jpg)


As you can see the returns from STR widely vary

I will confess it has been a very long time since I took statistics so perhaps somebody who has more recently taken a course or is more inclined to this sort of analysis can help shed some light on this.  


I would like to thank Malachi Chival of Aegis for helping me with all this testing. As it was a very long and arduous process of finding the right mobs and then breaking tools/weapons to be able to have a low enough damage that we could get enmity values. And then of course the average 3-5 minutes of watching a 2-3 damage pop up and slowly turn the mob around. Only to have a crit screw it up and obfuscate the actual value (knowing the Enmity lies between 135-137, get a broken weathered gladius and a low lvl GLA to do testing with. We should have done that, because a gladius is 2s swing speed and is by far the fastest low level weapon.",,False,self,t5_2rgs7,,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1ierax/enmity_tidbits_some_flash_testing/

Rested XP seems to just be a percentage of a level that's relative to your current one. Rested XP that's 80% of a level on your 34 class will still only be 80% of a level to a level 1. While it would last a long time on your level 34

I decided to take up a new crafting skill and used up my bonus in 3 or 4 synths to ease that difficult transition from level one to level 2!

If you want to get the most out of your rested XP. Play your highest level classes only until it's all gone.

Some more information:

---

**Vanguard is a newly established Free Company solely dedicated to bringing together like-minded players in Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn.**

You can check out our new guild page (still under development) at: http://vanguardfc.enjin.com/

*Server:* Tentatively Leviathan (New/NA)
*Time Zone/Locale:* We welcome players from all around the world
*Classification:* End-Game/Casual or ""casual-core""

---

We are set out to be a tight-knit family of dedicated, helpful, and selfless while demonstrating a degree of skill and determination in regard to the game's content - we are not interested in elitists, those who habitually exploit our kindness, and others who derive a sense of entitlement from always being first or having the best gear.


It is inevitable that we will all individually move on with our lives to other games or other responsibilities after committing what will hopefully be many years to Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn... but in the end

---

**The requirements to applying for membership into Vanguard are as follows:**

- Must be 18+ years old: many of our members are college graduates, we would generally like to avoid influencing or ostracizing those much younger than ourselves when discussing more mature topics ranging from careers to relationships.

- Must be friendly, we are looking to create a tight-knit group of like-minded players that share the same values and etiquette across all modes of social interaction.

- Must be willing to explore and push the end-game content of Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn (although it can be at your own pace)

---

**Other Important Notes:**

- We will have weekly events and do things together from time to time that really have no purpose in terms of progression once we reach end-game content but do help build our sense of family: FATEs, naked runs, and anything else fun that is possible in FFXIV: ARR. If you are the type of player that is always wanting to raid to stay ahead of the curve and that is all you want to do all the time, then this Free Company might not be the best fit for you. Vanguard will always strive to be ahead of the curve, but we won't sacrifice our sense of family in order to do so.

- Loot distribution will simply be on a one-person need-click basis, log time, or anything like that to determine any sort of advantage in loots or hierarchy, and we never will.

- Vanguard will be capped at a specific number of players at a later date to reflect our desire to incubate a tight-knit

- Those who enjoy crafting on a high level

- Any Lalafell deemed too cute will be forced to become our Free Company Mascot.

---

If interested

Thanks!

- Seraph

1375233447.0,1je2bu,Backlash for Gamebreaker.TV + Curse TL;DR,Mrhappy1227,150,99,141,"Hello Everyone

Having just finished up the show on Gamebreaker TV and coming to read the forums, I'd like to clarify a few things about why I do what I do.

First off is Curse. People seem very upset that I have my YouTube partnership with Curse when their website, prevents a lot of gameplay videos from being flagged on YouTube, and helps me grow. Basically, it helps me make a better YouTube channel for those who enjoy it. I did get offers from other YouTube networks and simply put, this one by FAR had the best resources. TGN didn't even come close.

Second is my appearance on GameBreaker TV, would you continue to do it? In terms of business shutting down the original show was likely the best move.

As for their demeanor towards people who defend 1.0, the game was definitely considered a flop and when portraying personal opinion that should be perfectly okay.

Now that those points are out of the way, wouldn't it be cool if this led to me doing what I love? Probably won't but it'd be cool"". After about a month and a half ago though it started blowing up (at least in terms of my expectations. I'm no PewDiePie).

I want keep making good content and expanding outwards to reach other types of gamers and I am a gamer at heart. However

Thank you
Mrhappy

- Individual homescreen widgets for each server that allows users to get the current status upon tapping.
- A push notification system that allows folks to be notified any time their chosen server changes status.

I plan on trying to organize as many events as possible on Gilgamesh and already have various ideas. I thought I might ask you all what sort of events you'd like to see. Who would know better what sort of events they'd like to participate in than the community itself? 

I understand that events are generally based on content

My vision is that we have enough types of events to where we can hold frequent events, this is all up for discussion and change, as it is very early. That being said, this will be a process that might take awhile to get in full gear. I understand that for awhile, many people will probably be more interested in dev content rather than community content. This is simply to start a pool of ideas. As for ideas I already have:

* Races with specific checkpoints to alleviate insta-teleport wins.
* Group/FC bracket tournaments in the Colosseum. 
* Organized named mob FATE hunts
* Themed Marches (we've already seen some of these.)
* Dance parties. (They're fun get togethers where you can meet new people.)
* Scavenger hunts (Can also be information scavenger hunts from specific NPCs or people
* Time Attack Dungeon runs monitored by a judge viewing a party streaming the dungeon
* Fashion shows after the vanity system is implemented. This is where crafting and dyes will shine!
* Personal/FC house event (Maybe along the same lines of fashion

What would you like to see? Do you have any suggestions to improve upon the current ideas?

Edit: Wow, they will surely be put to use. That being said, someone said that a Gilgamesh subreddit should be made. I am very new to reddit... Is that something we should do?

I will be using a website to help organize schedule information once I get down how timing will work. I have had two people offer their help as far as that goes. I will also post the announcements to reddit

The database tools are perfectly suited for the search for information about the items, quests, dungeons and monsters in the game. Provide a search function offline where you can search for the items you want and then find out which of these allow you to get those items, or if the item is a dungeon then dungeon in which you is the monster that has it

Finally there are the premium services. The services offered by these applications will be expanded and updated, say from school or work. Services include things like sell items at the market, buying items, transfer characters, etc.. We would like users to pay a small fee to be able to play when they are ahead of the game. ""

I just wanted to remind performance enthusiasts and players who don't want to sacrifice too much image quality for performance that there are subtle options that don't greatly affect the image quality too much  (or aren't that noticeable) but provide a phenomenal performance boost.

Sure it's nice to run stuff at maximum settings

In my opinion, and Anti-Aliasing.

**With Maximum Graphics Presets @1080p I score 7039 using 1920x1080 resolution with an average of 58.3 fps**

- **Screen Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO)**

With SSAO set to Low

With SSAO set Off I score ~7850 with an average of 66.8 fps. (14.6% performance increase)

**SSAO is a huge performance hog.**

- **Shadows**

Check marked Use low-detail models on shadows (LOD)

Shadows Resolution set to Mid

Shadow Cascading set to Normal

Shadow Softening set to Low


I score ~7300 with an average of 60 fps (3% performance increase)

**Surprisingly

*Reset back to maximum preset

- **Anti-Aliasing**

With anti-aliasing off I score ~7204 with an average of 59.9fps (2.8% performance increase)

**The anti-aliasing in this game is not really adjustable and the description is vague

*Reset back to maximum preset

- **Other options**

**These options give a pretty fair performance increase.  It lowers the detail on distant objects to provide performance boost.  Everything around you is still of same quality**

Shadow Cascading set to Normal

Shadow Softening set to Low

Anti-Aliasing set to Off

I score ~9724 with an average of 82.1fps (41% performance increase)

**As you can see this is a huge performance increase and in my opinion the image isn't sacrificed too much.**

## Terminology

I use an Xbox controller. The buttons are different to that of a Sony PS controller.

MS Xbox|Sony PS
:--:|:--:
Back|Select
Start|Start
A|X (Cross)
X|□ (Square)
Y|△ (Triangle)
B|○ (Circle)
LB (Left Bumper)|L1
LT (Left Trigger)|L2
RB|R1
RT|R2
L3 (Push in L-Stick)|L3
R3 (Push in R-Stick)|R3

This article will refer to the Xbox controller only.

In addition, when you read ""crossbar"" I mean the controller's version of ""hotbar"".

## Intro

Using the controller in this game is ridiculously fun. It's a refreshing change from using the keyboard in most typical mmo's. As a quick highlight

* Hand in quests. No longer do you use your mouse to drag or right click or double click for each item you need to turn in. On a controller it's as easy as hitting A three times. Done.
* Locking on targets. I don't know if there's a keybind or what for the keyboard players, and then left stick forward/backwards will move you like the keyboard W and S and the left/right will *circle* you around the target. It's a joke, really.
* Jumping around. If you like to take shortcuts
* Targeting. Both a positive and serious negative on the controller. On the positive if you don't like having to move your mouse over to click a person
* If you haven't seen the pattern yet, it hands in items, and it even starts auto-attacking creatures. A, A, A, A, A. Welcome to simplicity.

A minor convenience/inconvenience is that in ""direct chat"" mode typing any keys will go directly to the chat box. Personally I like that I can skip hitting ""enter"" to begin typing. But at times I'm annoyed that I can't hit the corresponding key for inventory or character sheet. I've overcome that annoyance by learning what all the icons in the bottom right corner mean or by using the controller to open it up. [You can also disable it entirely!](http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1i130m/a_beginners_guide_to_using_the_controller_for_ff/cazxgom)

### Negatives :(

Obviously there are some things that are sadly annoying with the controller.

* Targeting.

That's basically all I've got so far. During FATEs or in crowded areas targeting can be a real bi*** early on. I think it's gotten easier as I've learned it's not my camera that chooses the target but the direction my character is facing with the left stick.

Beyond the targeting issues I find I can do things at the speed and with the convenience I'd prefer to. Using the skills I need during a tough time is no biggie. Especially with the global cooldown in this game giving you time to think and react to your next move

I can go over some basic fixes for targeting later in this article. My friend says she has found the ultimate targeting fixes and that she will never use the keyboard except for typing / making macros etc.

## Basics

### Legacy vs. Standard Type

This is found in System Menu &gt; Character Configuration &gt; Control Settings (Default Menu) &gt; General (Default Tab) &gt; Movement Settings. I think the description is misleading in game. It says standard type is character-based and that legacy type is camera based, here's the quick rundown:

#### Legacy type (Default?)

* Left stick moves your character *forward* in whichever direction you choose
* Right stick moves your camera

#### Standard

* Left stick moves your character like a normal QWES keyboard would in relation to the camera
* Right stick moves your camera

#### Quick comparison

##### Legacy Pros

* The legacy option always moves your character at fullspeed (Means you can run away faster
* The right stick let's you see your face

##### Legacy Cons

* The camera is slow to turn in the direction your left stick has chosen to move the character (This can be remedied by using first person mode
* Thus

##### Standard Pros

* Familiar to keyboard users
* Easier to auto-run

##### Standard Cons

* When navigating a fight
* You cannot seem to see yourself from any angle but behind. Either the left stick walks backwards or the right stick constantly moves the character.

#### Winner?

In my opinion the Legacy mode is miles better than standard. However

### Crossbar vs. Hotbar

If you read the intro you know this is basically the controller's representation of the hotbar of skills/actions the keyboard 1-0, the controller lets you toggle which ""Set"" of skills/actions you have in front of you. As I understand the game so far, Set switching will not be required for casual players. For hardcore players it is easily do-able via macros/quick reactions. And I don't mean you need super quick. Each set of the controller's crossbar comes with 16 empty slots. You can place whatever you want on those. You can even swap the ""quick set swap"" set with another 16. So you can have 32 skills available with a combination of tapping RB (Right Bumper) to swap between one set of 16 skills or the next and then pulling the LT or the RT to choose one of 8 within that 16. It may sound complicated in writing, but in practice it should take no longer than a few minutes to figure out and less than an hour to ""train"" this into muscle memory. I actually quite like the crossbar and have yet felt ""stress"" when having to switch Sets.

### Sticks and Buttons -- What's the controller do?!

It's actually quite easy. For the most part the left stick is your character (The WASD on the keyboard) and the right stick is the camera (Right click and drag on the mouse). Beyond that here's what I got:

#### Roaming in the open game world (AKA - not in a menu

Controller|Output/Result
:--:|:--:
D-Pad Left/Right | Targets items left and right of you (Enemies
D-Pad Up/Down | Targets party-members; If alone
Back | Will target menus/windows on the screen (next table)
Start | Will target ""start""/system menu in the bottom right corner
A | Target what your character is facing (*)
X | Open Map/Close Map
Y | Jump
B | Nothing
LB | Nothing
LB (While moving with L) | Auto-Run (**)
LB + Right Stick Up/Down | Zoom in and out
LB + R3 | Use the mouse with the controller
RB | Swap crossbar to Set-8 (***)
RB (Hold) | Use the D-Pad or AXYB to swap to Sets 1 through 8
LT/RT | Activate the LT or RT Crossbar menus
LT+RT+Start | Take a screenshot!
L3 | Sit down (loll! Yay!)
R3 | First-Person Mode

Notes:

* * Targeting is interesting in this game. As a quick intro it prioritizes what is on your screen. (I believe it's Enemy &gt; NPC &gt; Other Players). After it's prioritization it tries to click the one closest to what you character is facing/standing. For instance if you're facing another player but there is an NPC on the screen it will target that first. You can offset this by hitting D-Pad Up/Down to target yourself (Party members) before hitting D-Pad Left/Right for players or by not having NPCs in sight when trying to click a player.
* ** Auto-running in legacy can be annoying at first. Refer to Legacy vs Standard to see how to offset it/learn it.
* *** It actually rotationally switches crossbars to any that are filled. Thanks to /u/idrumgood for the clarification!

#### Controller while targeting

The controller will soft target (circle with three breaks spinning in clockwise fashion) when hitting A or D-Pad Left/Up/Right/Down. It basically means you can engage/interact/hard-target what the circle is on or drop target with B/Esc. This table is for what the circle does

Controller|Output/Result
:--:|:--:
A (on NPC/Item) | Interact/Pick-Up
A (on other PC) | Lock
X (on NPC) | Nothing
X (on other PC) | Open menu for that player to Send Tell, Friend, Examine, &amp; Follow
D-Pad Up/Down | Targets Party Members
D-Pad Left/Right | Targets others (*)

Notes:

* * If in battle, Players. If there is no Enemy on screen, it'll target the next NPC, if no NPCs on the screen, it'll target the next Player.

#### Controller for Menus

Use Back to cycle through menus/windows on the screen. Use the D Pad and A to figure out the rest ;)

Note: You can change the default chat by selecting that menu with Back

## Conclusion

I have greatly enjoyed the controller in this game. I know that I haven't covered nearly enough in this guide

If I could say one thing to try and convince you to play with a controller it'd be that it's easier. Plain and simple. I keep going back to the keyboard/mouse to see if it's better/worse and each time it's just more immersive/fun/easier to use the controller for me.

You'll just have to try it for yourself and see :)

1372019654.0,1gxctr,So i tried out the Beta this weekend finally. If you played in 1.0 days and are on the fence definitely revisit the game.,Leucosia,53,10,53,"I bought 1.0 back in the day.  A friend of mine told me it was a great game and i would love it.  So i got the game; excited to finally play a FF MMO.  Suffice it to say it nearly ruined our friendship.  Bright side is through all of that i'm a legacy account now.  Some good came out of it i guess.

But i heard great things about ARR

I just wanted to say the game is ALOT better.  It plays so much better and feels more interactive.  The world is so rich and engaging.  The quests no longer feel as grindy and the dungeons i feel are pretty awesome as far as time commitment is required.

A couple things i want to point out to people having reservations about coming back that i initially held in the back of my mind.


**Combat:**  During legacy days the combat felt clunky and unrefined.    That's not so much the case now.  Each class has it's own style of combat mechanics that you'll pick up on rather quickly and the UI is alot crisper.  The combat feels much more rewarding.  This is definitely one of the biggest improvements over the original.  And by improvements i mean completely different and awesome.


**Crafting:**  Crafting has been simplified.  It's no longer the red light, the crafting mechanic, is what i feel the original tried desperately to be.  It's alot more engaging than your standard one click craft you're use to in other MMO's**
Make use of the armory inventory to make gear sets for different professions.


**Leveling:**  The quests are more streamlined and direct.  There's a fair mix of Postal Service quests, when they have you explore the whole place.)  Leve system is roughly the same with ""allowances.""  Use them wisely as their XP rewards are great for their level.  You might find yourselves a bit shy for certain storyline quests here and there.  you can get extra gil for killing mobs in the hunters journal.  Do a few of those and you'll find yourself at the appropriate level.

**Game World:**  the environment is beautiful as you would expect from a FF.  All three starting areas are unique and worth exploring on there own.  Venture out a bit and you'll see the landscape was well designed, navigation, and basic UI is great and intuitive (though using the map initially is a bit tricky.)

**Dungeons:** So far i think are great.  the balance between requirements and rewards are solid with minimal time commitments.  They don't take too much time and are fun and challenging.  The first one is roughly tank and spank but after that you can expect varying levels of boss mechanics.  Hint -  If something has the word ""inconspicuous"" in its name it probably needs to die or be switched on.

With that said here are a few cons.

~~* Cut scenes can get a bit long after a while.  For a game that's not voice acted with this many cut scenes i feel is a bit annoying

**Edit:  was just informed the main game is voice acted

* Debuff indicator is a bit hard to see.  Kind of nitpicking here but it took me 4 deaths to realize i was dying to poison because i never saw the damn icon.  and by ""to realize"" i mean i spent 20 minutes googling how to kill the thing.

* A bit sparse on quests at a few places.  I think i'm just use to having a plethora of quests at my disposal vs having a very few well thought out quests. 

* Chat system could use some refinement.  I.e. being able to use keyboard shortcuts and better optimization.  **It got annoying to right click send tell to and then have to click in the chat box again.  The implication is if i want to send a tell the next things i type are going to be the message.**

**edit for bold, but my main complaint was just some extra clicking involved, it's just inelegant design and an easy fix.  or you can mention alt-r, without bothering to read any of the other 25 comments who only mentioned that.**

That's all i can think of right now after playing non stop over the weekend.

It's a much better game and definitely worthy of a 2nd look if you were like me and decided to uninstall during the 1.0 days.
My complaints are mostly small and cosmetic

Also

Most of the time in real world political circles there's displayed a ""with us or against us"" mentality

Is the landscape really this polarized, tend to drift toward the middle? I'm genuinely curious what everyone thinks. MMO's are often times a sample of the population, but a very select one that pays to belong, so it's not a true analog of society.

TL;DR - Is there more than just Hardcore and Casual segments of MMO's

This is just a wall of text of what ARR (or at least my hopes) mean to me and my life.

I started FFXI when I was 9 years old on the ps2 after reading about it in a magazine - it was the first time I was ever allowed or had the opportunity to play a game online. The idea of magic

After that came picking a class. My brain danced with the possibilities. A thief? I didn't like the idea of stealing (I WAS 9!) - so I looked to the others. I wasn't a fan of using my fists, Black mage and Red mage. I loved the idea of one handed swords, but Warrior seemed bland. I could be a white mage and heal myself, or a Black mage and rain terror down on my enemy's with magic (maybe I was a little bit of an evil 9 year old).

After a long consideration - I went with Red Mage. Why choose just one when I could do them all?

After many hours of fumbling around

It scared the crap out of me. Worse than Buburimu. After joining several parties

This carried on through the rest of our time on FFXI. Trying to pull off the idea of a melee mage that could do it all. 

We explored this vast world together. 

The more we partied together

It was this friend that, the idea of ending my life.

FFXI was my childhood: Where my friends where

Though it came a time where I moved on from FFXI

When I heard of FFXIV being released I was excited to play

I gave up on the game not long after I started.

Fast forward to ARR - I feel that hope being sparked up again. This time I've learned my lesson though.

All I hope for in this game, and the ones I will meet.


Because when it's all said and done - after all the end game is devoured

The friends and experiences we met and made in this world - and that is my only expectation and hope for ARR.

http://forum.square-enix.com/ARR-Test/threads/58626-MAKE-THE-GAME-HARDER-NOT-EASIER

It's essentially a hardcore vs. casual discussion that I'm sure most of us have seen covered elsewhere.  What's interesting (and a little annoying) to me is the use of the word ""grinding"".  It's become a buzzword.  A curse word people throw around about games off the cuff to show their distaste for one part or another of just about any new title.  I'm guilty.  My friends are guilty.  As recent as last night

""Korean MMOs? Ugh
""JRPG?  Ew

More concerning to me is that it is totally affecting game developers now.  I notice this more with American developers.  I think the jury's still out whether this is a good thing or not--- I don't mean to say it's necessarily a bad change

With good reason.  What is grinding?

Most would say it's anything that requires a lot of repetition.  If that's the case

But let me explain

It really does come down to a matter of personal opinion.  For me, or at least get recognized for it.  If a system possesses those things and does them well, then for me personally, going through battle after battle (i.e. leveling) does not feel like a chore.

I believe this is true of any gamer.  The requirements might change from person to person

For me, years later, it does.  But at the time, it was a great time that I thoroughly enjoyed.  Months to hit max level? Over a year to max crafting? A couple of years to obtain a relic weapon?  Social, challenging, complex, advancement.  It hit all of those things in symphony for me

WoW was different, too.

Since leaving WoW (due to the falling off of those specific requirements of mine for enjoying a game), but destroyed their battle system with stats on endgame gear, and there was little to no advancement past a certain point.  Tera had a great combat system, with little to no social aspect or again, advancement.  GW2 was a little more social, but I felt the combat system was incredibly underwhelming and unrewarding.

It's common place to hear developers now talk about their coming games as ""not requiring a grind"", you'll have so many choices of what to do in our game!""

When the reality seems to be that coming games will have a huge variety of (mediocre might be the word) things to keep us busy for a short amount of time, those games won't hold major interest very long.

Games that succeed and are memorable do a handful of things, and portions of the market will be lost, but these are the ones that stand up for a long time.  It's the difference between entertaining a million for a month or entertaining 20,000 for 10 years.

I'd argue in the end

FFXIV Reborn has a great chance.  If it can do the basics right

It's not necessarily a bad thing.  So please,False,self,t5_2rgs7,False,,,t3_1gzdsi

1371409735.0,1ggvdv,Thoughts after hitting level 30 last night...,khaitto,54,9,71,"**Story Missions + Instances:** I rolled up the story missions and instances under one category because a great deal of the instances you will end up doing are a direct result of story missions send you there. While there is a solo aspect to the story arc

Without spoiling too much for those that want to start the game fresh, I found it to be a positive because I felt the 4 man content was beautifully executed. Unlike most low level content in modern MMO's, simply ignoring the boss mechanics and healing through them is not an option and gone are the days of mindlessly pressing 1112223333 while browsing reddit on your 2nd monitor as tank and spank boss #34 dies.  You're quickly put into situations in which you have to think on your feet to dodge certain boss mechanics or even figure out how to kill certain bosses (DAT SLIME BOSS.) 

The last instance we managed to do was Haukke Manor and a notable step up in difficulty was noted. Typically my group and I were able to pull several packs of mobs and systematically AOE them down. This, the difficultly of the instances and bosses was pretty low (at least from my perspective) but I would liken the difficulty to WoW pre-raid level cap content ie heroics and definitely not the mindless zerg that is pre-level cap instances. However, what makes me so satisfied with this content is that they are introducing raiding mechanics so early! I really feel that the design team has a firm grip of interesting raiding mechanics and will be able to deliver challenging endgame content for us to sink our teeth into.

**FATE / Guildhest / Leve / Questing / General Pacing:** While leves, the variation is absolutely refreshing. I always felt that there was something to look forward to or something new to experience throughout the leveling process. This is compounded by the fact that for the first time in what felt like a lifetime, a game has made exploration exciting. The game is drop dead gorgeous and really does its job making you feel like you want to take a few moments to appreciate the scenery. Although I'm not too sure about the previous betas as I haven't played the other phases, but getting to level 30 in two days was very easy to do despite having never played the game before. In general, I felt the levels were not scaled exponentially but more akin to the guild wars 2 system (each level takes approximately the same amount of time to get -- barring the early levels.)

The guildhests re awesome and well worth doing. Again, Tera, Rift, etc... to something that penalizes you heavily if you make a mistake. I feel that guildhests will prepare all players to be able to tackle endgame with much more ease and more importantly, confidence. Better yet, they reward a metric !@#! ton of experience once completed and DEFINITELY part of the min/max for leveling. 

I feel that the best part of FFXIV leveling's scheme is the pacing. Whenever you feel you're getting bored of questing, you're able to take on well done story quests that send you to instances, encounter epic bosses, and become enthralled in the epic storyline. Did I forget to mention that there are class quests that reward new abilities and mission quests that reward you your own personal chocobo that acts as a mount and a COMBAT ready pet that can DPS, Heal, and Tank? 

**Combat:** I felt the combat was standard. However

- When leveling a second class
- Addressed a bug where the cursor goes funny in some instances
- Adjustments to how (slow/fast) a Gatherer levels
- Adjustments (maybe) to the ease of making HQs from NQ materials in crafting
- An in-game event will be implemented right away after Launch (Bomb Event?)

second, but it's nothing to the 30 craftsmanship that you can make with blacksmithing.

third:  if you're crafting, before you even hit level 5 you can be rocking +20 control and +18 craftsmanship, and +25 craftsmanship at level 6.  that gear makes a huge difference.

fourth:  if you're gathering, you can sit on 19 gathering, 13 perception from weaver alone. 

fifth:  leatherworker is no punk bitch either.  for crafters, it's a 10 gathering, 9 perception difference at 1; or a 2 gathering, 8 perception, 12 GP difference at 5.  at 11 it's +3 gathering, +15 perception.  

sixth:  always, but it looks like about 5% bonus experience per %chance of high quality result - to a maximum.  when making maple lumber i was getting +226% experience for the craft at +14% hq chance.  getting a HQ result did not seem to award extra experience, but raising the HQ chance always did.

i can't wait for the open beta/release!  

TL;DR:  blacksmith makes lots of tools and secondary tools; leatherworker and weaver make gathering and crafging gear; always go for as high a HQ chance as possible without failing synthesis.

second was the GP regen while gathering.  it seemed to me that GP regenerated at 5 points about every 10 seconds while not gathering, restored them while gathering.

1373325838.0,1hwc1e,Can't make up your mind on which class to play?,ahfuah,55,14,99,"Hello all

I made this post in the EDEN forums (http://edenfc.enjin.com/forum) and thought I'd share this with y'all. I have had a terrible time picking a race/class to main for FFXIV:ARR. In light of this past weekend's beta

Note: These are my opinions and are for a group/dungeon perspective. I will not be going into the skill combos/rotations or strategy. Instead I'll just be summarizing my experiences with the classes through these entry level dungeons. I mostly ran Sastasha, but I think the overall gist of each class is apparent.


Tanks: Really fun, SE has made both classes unique in their tanking experience.

**Gladiator - GLA**: Tank in it's truest form with heavy armor and shield. The involvement associated with this class comes from managing mana and TP together to keep enmity at its highest. There are moves that help you get back some mana, but you don't take a lot either. As an analogy, GLD feels like a military personnel and requires his training to do his job properly. Each move is thought out.

**Marauder - MRD**: A different perspective to tanking. Straight up, but my experience is limited. As an analogy, the MRD is essentially the big guy that comes in and tries to get as many people to fight him at once because he knows what he can do.

Summary: In the end


Damage dealers: I'll cover the 4 dps classes in beta currently: Archer, Thaumaturge. All fun in their own respects, so let's get to it.

**Archer - ARC**: Exactly as the name suggests. You have a bow and you shoot arrows with it. Effective DD with not much movement requirements in dungeons. Future boss fights may have mechanics that require you to do so, and fire away. Looking further into the BRD class, you end up getting songs which are buffs/debuffs so there's some depth to the class. For the most part, Archers are DD with some support skills. At the end of the day, the involvement comes from managing the buffs/debuffs and GCDs for your skills so you maintain optimal DPS.

**Lancer - LNC**: The class that I started with in beta. Have always wanted to play a dragoon in FFXI but never got close to it. Lancers are a different take on melee DDs, you end up getting skills with jumps, which is just plain cool. All in all, Lancers are high mobility melee DPS.

**Pugilist - PGL**: Pugilists are the other melee DD in the beta. They're super fun, it's almost like a kung-fu movie without the cheesy dubs. The animations on the pugilist moves are pretty slick and fluid to be honest.

**Thaumaturge - THM**: Ever wanted to be a walking nuke? Look no further, cost more mana, and reduces mana regen. Ice spells do less damage, cost less mana, but increases mana regen. Oh you also have a sleep spell which is great for CC and managing adds or large packs. As a THM, you're basically managing the auras and spell rotations for maximum damage output. If you're not casting something, you're slacking.

Summary: The damage dealer classes are all unique in their own way. The differences between each class come from the style of play



Healers: Only 1 class right now which is the Conjurer.

**Conjurer - CNJ**: There is currently only 1 healing class, and you cast the occasional damage spell. I've played healers in other MMOs, and have always enjoyed the role tremendously.

Summary: Do you really need one? Really?


There you have it. I hope this helps you in making your decision for your first main class in FFXIV:ARR. If you have any questions

edit 1 for further clarification: 

""I thought the full game key could already be found in the games -&gt; others tab. I registered the code to the SE members site."" 

A lot of people were confused with this too. You can ""register"" your code  at http://eu.square-enix.com/en but this IS NOT registering the game. The website previously stated is actually like a facebook kinda thing and by registering your code there

TLDR;
Code you got from GMG is early access code. If you think you already registered the game; you didn't. Product keys will be sent at the release of the game. (27th August)

Timeline: (My prediction )
During the period of phase 4 into Early access. People will be able to enter their early access codes giving them early access to FFXIV ARR. (As a lot of people will probably pre-order after phase 4)

At the end of Early Access OR during- We will receive another email from our distributors with the product key giving us access to the launch of FFXIV ARR with 1 month subscription.

DoW  
- ARC to lv 4
- PGL to lv 12, 15% evasion CD, good CDs that can be used situationally for optimal results

DoM
- CNJ to 12.  pretty much same as above.  

its still unknown what Arcanist will bring to the table but DoM is a little lacking currently but its bias to DoW because of sheer numbers.

I played FFXIV 1.x on and off for about 8-9 months (starting at launch, but eventually 2 things killed it for me, and one of them drove me absolutely insane.

* The game was not fun/enjoyable/practical/anything else you can think of to interact with.  Known gripe.
* They reimplemented what made FFXI so immersive


The second bullet makes me want to punt flaming kittens into the nutsack of whoever decided to be fucking lazy.  One can argue the values of a system that doesn't feed you all the information you think you ~~need~~ deserve up front (I am a long-term FFXI player


Now before we start arguing about ""All that has changed, and check out the changes.  Every time I logged in, I was floored because:

* I enjoyed the experience and interactions more than the previous time I returned and
* I felt overwhelmed as a returning player by the number of things I **couldn't find information on**. 


In comes ARR Alpha.  At the start, but from what I had seen, the game was just going to be FFXI HD: Ra/Ex Grindfest &amp; WikiReading Expansion XVIII.


When they finally started releasing videos of gameplay, and every gripe I had about lack of information was dissappearing before my eyes (I'm looking at you, crafting &amp; gathering system).  


Edit: I'm glad this is actually getting some solid talk going.  :] thank you


I don't think I've been this excited for a video game (in general) in *years*, I just choose to retcon my memory to pretend AC never existed.)

i wonder if the devs have spent the whole time overhauling the complete 1-50 experience, what about everyone who already completed 1-50, is there something a long the lines of a expansion worth of content for players who've been playing 1.0 for years? will they have to wait a few months for us new players to experience the game and reach 50 before content designed for them  starts rolling out? if so, is ARR for new players specifically?

Turns out there are two (maybe three) things that many people don't seem to know about materia.  The first is that you need to be equal to or higher than the required level of the gear you are trying to affix materia to.  So I wanted to put materia in my lvl 30ish gear, you need the correct DoH class to affix materia to specific armor types.  For example a Weaver can affix materia to cloth gear, but not to armor.

As I leveled other classes this past weekend

Firstly, alternating savage blade between the 2 while observing the built in threat meter is the best course of action. I've found that the best rotation for this is 1-2-1 on your main target, followed by 2-1 on the alternate target. This alternates between the 2 targets until they are both dead with an occasional flash thrown in.

Once you get Rage of Halone it becomes much more easy as both Rage of Halone and Fast Blade to Savage Blade increase threat on the target they are used on.

Secondly, while making positioning a nightmare for the dps. Keep in mind, in this game, dps positioning is huge. There are abilities that do more damage at a flank, or from the back, and your job is to keep the mob stationary so the dps can do their thing, while also keeping everything on you.

Sometimes it is unavoidable to have to move to pick something up

Lastly, but keep in mind you as a tank set the pace. The most important skill for a tank to have in my opinion, is the ability to know when to rush and when to stop. Keep an eye on your party members. It's your job. Watch their mana, their health, their surroundings. It is you and you alone that protect them. Don't be afraid to push forward, or be scared. Being cautious is okay, but trust in your abilities as a tank.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1gzr5s/for_those_having_trouble_with_tanking_as_a_glad/

1362075105.0,19epgj,[Meta] Draft of small rule change for NDA/beta topics.,reseph,42,4,15,"Hello /r/ffxiv! Thank you for your time in the last day

I understand there are conflicting viewpoints and we're not looking to divide the community here. One possibility we as a community discussed was to remove all posts that violated the NDA and I would like to first say we will not be doing this. I want to make it clear that we mods are part of the community

----

Based on your community feedback

1. **Spoiler tag all topics containing leaked beta details.**
2. **Remove unconstructive question/inquiry topics (submissions) about beta.**
3. **Remove beta bug reports or suggestions.**

----

1. An example of a topic needing to be spoiler tagged would be a submission of an Imgur.com picture from a player showing a leaked beta screenshot. A press-released picture of beta (or something in the news) would not need to be spoiler tagged.

2. An example of an unconstructive question/inquiry would be something like ""Is Red Mage in the ARR beta?"" or ""How much Gil do you get from quest rewards in ARR beta?"" or ""What is the death penalty for dying in ARR beta?"". Not only are these not constructive

3. An example of a bug report or suggestion is something like ""My game crashes when playing ARR beta"" or ""SE should up the XP rate in ARR beta"". These kind of topics are meant for the official ARR beta forums so SE can actually review them.

----

I'm also implementing some more feature for the subreddit (under construction):

* Done: Mobile-friendly spoiler comment formatting:   
[FFXIV ARR is](#s ""currently in closed beta"")   
\[FFXIV ARR is\](#s ""currently in closed beta"")

* Done: Popup CSS box on downvotes (on comments) to indicate downvotes [are not used because you disagree](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).

* More text boxes to indicate things like violating the NDA may cause SE to take action against a user

----

Let me know what you think and if there are no qualms against all of this we can start working this up in a day or two. I understand this may not meet the specifics of every specific viewpoint; but don't leave out your feedback if you think of a way to improve this.

I have a 8 year old who is pretty damn intelligent.  But he's still 8 and suffers socially.  I was hoping that if he played with me (which I would only let him play with me or his mother) that he may get practice being a team player and learning how to think about others.

FFXIV is a team based game, and he can only play in a party if I'm in it.

I would like to know your thoughts and rules on letting your kids play.  This isn't a topic to argue parenting ideologies and what's wrong and what's right.  I just wanna know.

The amount of reduction on GCD from applying skill speed is really low as of right now. You are literally getting a return of around .1 second of reduction for every 100 skill speed you have from gear. As of this moment

Human error will typically negate the effect of a .1 second cooldown reduction. If you are a robot, even for 1 SECOND, you are essentially negating 10 GCD rotation's worth of reduction from 100 points of skill speed. 

Skill speed as a stat feels like it needs a boost. Why even have this stat on gear if the return is practically negligible? In fact

1. Is there an easy way to search and look up clans/guilds and also what is the term for it? Is that Linkshell?
2. I noticed not a loot has been dropping off mobs. Is this game heavily quest based for rewards and making pure mob grinding not as worth it?
3. I can't seem to find much if any armor/weapons from quests / mobs. Is this game HEAVY craft/vendor?
4. Is the crafted gear more superior then vendor gear?

If above is true or even not is there long epic quests or mechanics that are not in most MMORPG's where takes a long time to unlock something and I don't mean leveling to max level but more like special quest that you work on for a long long time to get a special reward or something around them lines?
8. How does one activate these kill bonuses or they just random where you have I think 60 seconds to kill as many mobs for extra exp?
9. Is there any kind of form of auction house/ trading post?
10. Being an archer / range class and first time actually playing such. I find they seem to be VERY overpowered with their kitting abilities. Is this normal and is this kind of power still exist at higher levels? If so are melee classes like rocks or do insane damage or is there just a major unbalance? 
11. When equipping some items I noticed a black and red dot at the top right of the item. What do they represent? 
12. So I hear you can have more then 1 class on a character. Can I do every single one and not re-roll or is there a limitation?
13. Following the question above is there something called a sub-class? Like mixing 2 classes up or is that just switching weapons into a new class?
14. I hear there is housing in the game. Is there any kind of info on how this works? What kind housing etc etc. Like Rift,,False,self,t5_2rgs7,False,,True

1372631186.0,1he0h0,Crafting observations,piedpipernyc,36,4,68,"Just some random notes from leveling GSM BSM CRP LWR this weekend.  
  .  

All basic craft materials tend to be available from that your vendor; if it's not there
  .  

All non-HQ versions are sold by a vendor somewhere; in short it's a waste of time selling the lower level regular items. The upside is even beta players were buying HQ items from AH.  
  .  
  
Get your retainer ASAP. Having all that work done only to end up vendoring it is heartbreaking. As someone who feels like he's going to craft alot
  .  
If you are making your own gear, convert, and switch to the spare you made. This will build your stock up at a reasonable rate.  
  .  
Go for HQ no matter what you are making. It increases your exp thus saving on mats for what you really want to make.  
  .
Do not trust the counter when you are doing ""Make x of y"" quests. HQ items count towards this
  .
Either buy or spend time making your basic mats, buying a stack of them is fine also.  Later on, someone will likely do the math for how much of each mat you will need to level. 
  .  
You will go through crystals fast; grinding 400+ shards when you start your Disciple of the Land is not a bad idea considering they give reasonable exp when you start out. It's very inefficient to run out of shards in the middle of a long crafting session (I lost track of a couple of hours
  .
Touch during rainbow if possible
  .
They have crafting food with +3% exp; helps greatly if you're off by x cp to finish touching something.  
  .  
I do not know if on purpose of if they will fix it
  .  
Repairing gives you exp
  .  
As tempting as it is to use leves for you main, using a leve can easily assist you to get that one level to access silver or etc, instead of grinding something you'll have to vendor. Your main will quests and dungeon leveling for exp.  
  .
Lastly, HQ tools are only one point lower than your next upgrade, meaning you can keep working or just get much better results.

I've been playing games, and that engrossed me very early on for many years to come...in fact, it kept me busy right up until the point I quit to play a new game I had heard was going to be awesome:  Final Fantasy 11.

I had played other MMOs here and there along the way, FFXI.  I have amazingly fond memories of these games, shared with friends (IRL and over seas alike) that will put a smile on my face until my deathbed.

But after a while, but nearly everyone I knew and played with converted over, and i'm a social guy, so, naturally, my friends jumped off a bridge so I did too!

Fast forward to just a few days ago, and am working diligently to resolve it, but WoW, for the 7 or so years I played it, has made me a sloppy, lazy, entitled ""gamer""

I realized this when I first tried to play FFXI and, the graphics were hard to muster (i'm NOT a graphics whore, but things just seemed so ""off"" to me) and when adding that to the fact that I was unsuccessful in retaining my old FFXI account via SE customer support (apparently several years is too long of a wait)...and it scared me off.

After a day of thinking on this, I started reading about FFXIV.  I had heard it was a massive disappointment at launch, so I did not buy it when it came out...but decided at this point to look into it again, and see if changes were being made.

My jaw could literally have hit the floor if it weren't attached to the rest of my head.  I could not believe what I was reading:  Square Enix

This amazed me.  I had never seen this type of apology from a huge game company, deal with it"" instead of ""We're sorry you didn't like your entree, here, let us redo it for you""

So that, i'm not disappointed...and it's only reminded me that much more what WOW has done to me.

I'm finding myself getting actually excited at the idea of a real grind.  I'm finding myself getting actually excited that something is probably going to take a long time to accomplish

I love that the game doesn't do all of the foot work for me.  World of Warcraft was essentially a game on rails and the only control I *REALLY* had was clicking the mouse to say ""Go here

In games like FFXI/XIV The minimap doesn't show me exactly where to go

I got so dumbed down that I actually relied on an addon called *Deadly Boss Mods* to tell me what to do, i'm no longer playing World of Warcraft...i'm now playing Simon Says, and as long as I hit the green button THEN the red button, then I win and the loot drops...after running so many instances, over and over and over, you begin to realize that the item you're after hasn't dropped, and you've got nothing else to do but run some lagged as hell Battlegrounds and collect welfare PVP epics.

I don't know why i'm posting this- I guess i'm just excited to be excited over a game again.  I'm looking forward to in depth crafting that does not involve a simple ""click fail

the key thing to know is that the game technically thinks you are a lv1 in everything, but you wont have cure 2 because it's from a class quest... to be specific it's from a lv30 class quest, and you need to start from 1.

• select character

• unlock limsa aethers (touch all aethers like a mad man from this point on. you dont have any waypoints anymore)

• visit the Calamity Salvager. he will be holding a bunch of random items of yours. you can take them all off hi or take a few off him for now and let him hold them. but mainly
**another thing you'll want to grab at this point is your 1.0 collectors items. hermes shoes, but these low level synced areas coming up are going to be your prime chance to get some use out of the other items as well.

• do MRD class quest to 15 (this will unlock hunting logs, and the ability to begin other class quests).

• do main Story to 15 (this first 15 levels of the story take place in your starting city, airships, and ultimately the instance raids portion of the plot). this is the full extent of the commitment you have to your starter city. main story quests carry you all over the place. you will want to learn to utilize RETURN and FAVORED locations as best you can to prevent spending excessive money on teleporting all over the place.

• fly to uldah

• do THM class to 15 to obtain the lv 15 quest ability

• do PGL class quests to 15 to obtain the lv 15 quest ability

• fly to grid

• do CON class quests to 15 to obtain the lv 15 quest ability

• THEN with those 4 jobs as my base options

• sometime around this now, to set aside some time, maybe pick up a six pack of beer... and re-organize your nasty old inventory, full of a ton of shit you can barely remember. get your retainers back, get all the random items. make one retainer a crafting item holder. one an equipment holder. whatever. everyone has their thing. you can start selling items you dont want at this point, but play the market at your own risk since it will be so early on.

• more story, the ability to use your chocobo as a pet in battle, the ability to recieve and spend GC seals, and alllllll the extensive content that comes with it).

• materia unlock.

• armor dyeing unlock.

• speaking to any remaining crafting guilds and joining them (this unlocks additional slots for saving gear sets)

• do THM class to 30 to obtain the lv 30 quest ability

• do CON class to 30 to obtain the lv 30 quest ability

• do PGL class to 30 to obtain the lv 30 quest ability

• do MRD class to 30 to obtain the lv 30 quest ability

* Early levels go fast and the ""punch a rat"" levels are basically used as a quick tutorial. There are plenty of easy quests to get to level 5-10 in only a couple hours.

* The storyline makes the early game grind much more bearable and interesting. While it's padded out with ""Punch 4 rats""

* Combat is very interesting. In the first couple levels this does not show, and not in ways that are simply stat buffs. The slugs that spawn near Tam Tara in a quest for instance have a very powerful AOE spell that if you do not dodge will fuck your day up. Then there is another quest with a considerable amount of low level casting enemies. These require you to learn, adapt and think. The classes also have position based skills, so I've found myself stunning enemies and then running behind them for a high-damage backstab. This is pretty cool.

* Shared enemies you can help random strangers with CONSIDERABLY enhances the game world. It basically allows de facto grouping in quests. It also allows other players to come save your dumb ass which happens a lot.

* But most of all: The early level content is actually interesting and engaging. The monsters are starting to feel unique and not just as if they are healthbars I have to mindlessly whittle away.

At first glance it seems there is almost the same amount of gil sinks in end game as there are mid and early. This time, in all aspects of the game:

(% Values based on gil granted by questing with one class from level 1 to 50 and the time spent to get to 50 on only one class)

 * Travel costs: **5% ~ 70% (*depending on what type of transportation and how often it is used [teleporting costs +/-100x more expensive than other forms of transportation depending on distance from point]*)**
 * Crafting: **&lt;1% ~ 15%**
 * Early game gear: **&lt;1%**
 * Repairs: **~5% (*depending on how often you die mostly
 * Mid game gear: **10%**
 * End game auctioned gear: **~60%**
 * Housing: **100% ~1000% (*100% is a small plot. 1000% is a mansion plot.*)**
 * FC Halls: **(*unconfirmed estimate based on housing costs*) 3000%?**
 * Other gil sinks: **(*infinite value*)**

1. *Due to the low cost of crafting mats, but you must take into account the time spent on crafting. (***This option is attractive for those who have goals in mind for their gil.***)*

2. *In my personal beta experience, I found myself out of money, just going from one story quest, to another. Though I was able to finish quests like they were nothing, this is definitely something to think about when deciding to use the teleport to crystals system in the game. (***This option is attractive for speeding into the end-game.***)*

3. *Finally, you will have the gil to spend on either the gear you need at end game, or things you want like housing, immediately. (***This option is attractive for giving yourself time to think about the best options possible to spend gil on.***)*

In no way are any of these options more ""correct"" then the others. This is the point in which you ask yourself a personal question. ""How do I want to play?""

1373443107.0,1hzukk,Hello FFXIV. Some things about Marauder. That I have found from here to 30.,Avengedx,37,7,55,"As a side note: This was made for my FC's forums. None of our FC played to legacy though many of us played in 1.0

Preface:

On the old forums I gave a general difference between the Marauder, and would like to share some of my findings, and also outline the benefit of this tanking class. Here is a summary of my findings, and with it I will also add a little bit of anecdotal evidence that I have gotten from some of the healers that I have played with.

I. The Marauder/Warrior breakdown: As a tank there are many ways to judge your viability, Threat, and Effective Health. All four are extremely important, but only three are measureable.

A. Mitigation - How to stop worrying

1. One of the main differences between a dps class and a tank is their defensive capabilities. These capabilities can be both active or passive. Fortunately for us, a shield does not add at all to the Paladins flat mitigation (when i say this I mean that if a Paladin does not block an attack, then they are taking a similar amount of damage to a Warrior outside of abilities at 30. The Paladin will bloom at 40, and we will have a different topic to speak of then). Instead of just focusing on the difference between the two though, I feel that we should just go headlong into what a Warrior brings to the table.

2 . The Warrior is a plate wearing class

3. The warrior has the ability to parry attacks and reduce damage even further on a % basis. This is controlled by the strength and dexterity stats that both increase damage reduced

4. Warriors have a 20% to defense cooldown. This is very effective in reducing overall damage.

5. Warriors receive passive mitigation through abilities that give bonuses based on health. As the warrior has the largest health pool in the game

6. Warrior has access to the Gladiators Awareness ability. This will reduce our chance of being hit critically.

7. Finally

B. Threat - Or the non-issue with Warriors.

1. Warriors have a superior advantage currently with AOE threat. The ability to spam Overpower gives us a 120 potency attack that hits all mobs in a frontal cone. Because of this tanking with a Warrior can feel a little mindless as compared to a Paladin. The enmity of a single Overpower is higher than a cast of flash

2. The single target threat for a Warrior gets a small hit until they hit level 30. The third enmity attack in our rotation comes 4 levels later then an equivalent Paladin. When we get Butchers Block though, to moving them down to 1/4 of my threat. This is really important as it allows you to be more diverse in your rotation.

3. Warriors are able to use the 22 Gladiator skill Provoke. This means that the Warriors greatest weakness can easier be managed

4. The level 30 Warrior stance provides 25% health, and there are many job specific abilities that warriors have that bypass the 35% damage reduction on top of that. In this regard, from a pure threat standpoint, the Warrior should have the highest single target threat generation of any class in the game.

C. Effective health. - The true gem of the Warrior.

1. Vitality is the most important statistic to a Warrior. It gives you the single highest stat value of any other Job/stat combination in the game. Our level 30 Warrior stance provides us with 25% more health

2. Effective health is determined by 2 factors, which will allow you to absorb up to 10% (hard to obtain) of your health pool from both magical or physical attacks every 15 seconds. The fact that barriers do not care whether or not it is magical or physical damage give us a great advantage, as magical mitigation is useless when the Paladin raises his shield.

3. A larger health pool also increases the effects of abilities like stoneskin

4. A more controversial statement is in the mana efficiency of the Warrior in a group. Since the Warrior innately takes more damage than its rivals in combat, which is prior to storm's path you will most likely see a drop in overall effectiveness, but it will come full circle by that point.

Conclusion:

The immediate effects between the Warrior and Paladin switch is going to look very bleak for Paladins in the beginning. The fact that Paladins do not receive their DMG reduction, and this will even things out more then make things unbalanced. In the end it may come down to playstyle, but Warriors really have everything in their toolset that they need to both off-tank and main tank. I am sure we will get into this further when Ry chimes in on the Gladiator more in depth!",,False,self,t5_2rgs7,,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1hzukk/hello_ffxiv_some_things_about_marauder_that_i/

How should posts/comments violating the NDA be handled? I see 3 ways we could handle it:

* Remove all posts/comments violating the NDA.
* Don't remove any post/comments violating the NDA (as we do now).
* Create a new subreddit for ""beta"" discussions.

[EDIT] 2 other possible options:

* Remove all questions about beta
* Spoiler-tag all beta posts.

[Spell naming conventions in FFXIV

&gt;He explained the following reasons that the team decided to go with the numerical numbering, etc.

&gt;First off

&gt;Secondly, for example). In a self-contained game, where you're sure ""this is the full spell list"" it's easy to branch out, and finalize the names in specific styles. But when it comes to the ever-evolving MMORPG, you never know when a new spell will be added after a level cap increase. What comes after ""za""? Is it really possible that those will work with every spell name?

&gt;Thirdly

&gt;Hopefully the above makes it a bit clearer on the reasoning for the decision!

1374520959.0,1ity63,Arcanist Healing/DPS Skill Speculation,Hello_Bear,39,12,88,"Long time reader

This post was created for the speculation of the Arcanist (ACN) class mechanics. I know not a lot of information is available about this class

Here is a brief list of information we have regarding the ACN.

•	[Data-mined skill list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1a40tf/arcanist_summoner_skills_breaksown/)

•	[Interview translation stating Arcanist will be a healing class](http://rainyautumnskies.wordpress.com/2013/07/06/05-07-2011-interview-with-naoki-yoshida-at-the-japan-expo-paris/)


First I’d like to point out that the skill list is very old, but that Arcanist will solve the problem.

My current speculation is that Arcanist will receive a conversion ability for their skills, etc. Ultimately, this kind of utility would give Arcanists the ability to swap back and forth between Healer or DPS (again, similar to Conjuror/White Mage), but would allow them to queue for both roles.

What are your thoughts?

**EDIT (thanks angrae): 

&gt; Chuki (JOL): At the very beginning of the game

&gt; NY: Actually, that’s because up to level 15, it doesn’t really &gt;matter whether you lack tanks or healers, there’s no specific content &gt;that requires it. After level 15 maybe yes. I do realise that Limsa &gt;Lominsa has been lacking a healer because the Arcanist hasn’t been &gt;released yet, but that should be solved anyway.**

Time to get on and try out more things and just play around more xD but I want to take some time and post about the last class BLM. In 1.0 I hated BLM to me it was the equivalent of whole grain toast with nothing on it. Plain and boring. Thats my opinion of course and I still  played a bit of BLM (Coiiiinnnnnncounterrrrrrrrrrr). Anyway in 2.0 they are a completely different class. BLM was made with a lot of depth and a lot of mechanics to them and while they are mechanically deep they are fairly simple to play. This class has definitely been one of the more fun classes that I've been tinkering with.


So What is so great about BLM:

* **Astral Fire**: Where do I start? Well first the numbers AS Fire III gives you roughly a 2x damage increase and doubles the cost of your Fire spells. This was putting my Fire III at roughly 600-650 damage and gave it a cost of 1k Mana (3k Mana total). You can jump right into AF III using Fire III or Flare (Not recommended to get in AF III lol) or you can build it up by casting Fire I three times. Blizzard spells are also fairly cheap my Blizzard 3 goes from a 319(?) cost to a 79 mp cost while I'm under AF III but it will do about ~35% less damage when cast. As you can see this buff alone has a lot of depth to it.

* **Umbral Ice**: Mana isn't an issue with Umbral Ice III

* **Transpose** : You get it really early and its a really great skill. Not only does it let you push your mana to the limits with Fire but it gives you a great mp recovery option after Flare. It only turns AF III into UI I though so the mana regen isn't as fast as it could be.

* **Swiftcast** : Best with Flare or Sleep in my opinion. Regardless a cool ""Chainspell"" skill.

* **Sleep / Lethargy/ Freeze** : This is where blm shines - crowd control. If you have done a dungeon in FFXIV then you probably know how useful sleep is so I probably don't need to touch on that. Lethargy is a really unique spell since its not on the gcd and its effect is really useful. Not only does it slow the monsters attacking down but it makes them slower to move. This can be used in kiting/soloing and in group play. Freeze is an interesting spell and while I can't think of a good use for it now I'm sure there will be a time when you want a large group of mobs bound together and I feel that the effect it has will be priceless to later end game content (Ofc I don't know for sure).

* **Aetherial Manipulation** : I was honestly disapointed in this skill

* **Apocatastasis** - That name... lol. Anyway


* **Manawall/ Manaward** - Manaward will definitely be a primal spell (Imagine if their astrals are elemental you can protect yourself and the whm!) and may have some uses else where. Manawall seems like a panic button and since I'm sure that mobs later on will have the ability to near one shot a squishy this will be invaluable too.

* **Convert** - While this may seem a bit useless it can be used to pull off two flares in a row while under the effects of raging strikes... I think that its best use unless you mess up your AF/UI.


Tips for playing BLM

* Accuracy is important! If you miss a spell you don't get the AF / UI effect and the spell will do less damage. Even on level 50 normal mobs I was having trouble hitting spells.

* As a BLM you can really play with your skill order in whichever way you want but imo the best rotation will probably be: **Open Thunder III &gt; Fire III &gt; Fire Starter combo &gt; Flare when low on mana &gt; Transpose &gt; Thunder III &gt; Blizzard III &gt; Fire III &gt; Firestarter combo ect.**

* In the combo above if Thundercloud procs cast it with Thunder II and if it some how procs twice cast Thunder I!

* Convert can get you a second flare! And like I said before pair it with Raging strikes for massive damage numbers!

* Sleep

* Pair up Surecast and sleep/freeze when you get unwanted aggro.

* Swiftcast is probably best used with Flare if using the rotation I gave you up there but I'm sure you can find a good use for it else where (AKA emergency sleeping). While I wanna say ""Keep it on CD"" end game content may make me say ""Save it for emergencies"".

* **Be wary of Thundercloud** - I feel its a n00btrap. Don't get me wrong the trait is amazing but if you waste all your time using Thunder III


Overview:

If big numbers are your thing BLM is what you want and while a few parse runs I did had BLM dragging behind a lot of other classes their utility and burst damage is amazing so don't be discouraged by me or anyone else saying ""BLM doesn't do as much damage"". The class is made well

Anyway that is every class

I hope this helped someone!

It turns out dozens of people, I decided to plant myself down on the big rock there and spend some time Raising everybody who popped out.

Several of you have chimed in stating that the EN help text for Blizzard/Fire II and III are incorrect. This doesn't surprise me considering how many times the battle team tweaks the effects of each action in the span of even a week. Excuses aside

Blizzard II

- Deals ice damage with a potency of 100 to all nearby enemies.
- Additional Effect: Bind Duration: 4s
- Additional Effect: *Grants Umbral Ice II* or removes Astral Fire
- Duration: 10s

↓

- Deals ice damage with a potency of 100 to all nearby enemies.
- Additional Effect: Bind Duration: 4s

Blizzard III

- Deals ice damage with a potency of 220 ~~to all nearby enemies.~~
- Additional Effect: *Grants Umbral Ice III* or removes Astral Fire
- Duration: 10s

↓

- Deals ice damage with a potency of 220 ~~to all nearby enemies.~~
- Additional Effect: *Grants full stack of Umbral Ice* or removes Astral Fire
- Duration: 10s

1. After installing the client

(That is the directory for Windows 7. I'm not sure if it's the same on XP. just start a search for the code d96437e6 if you can't find it)

3. In the ""MetaInfo"" folder. You'll find 4 torrents. Download them all using your favorite Torrent downloading software. (Approx. 4.8GB). You should get a more decent speed. (0-5kb/s on the official downloader.

4. When done

This being said

If you're unsure whether you should post on the beta forums

For myself:

* **Limit Breaks:** (they're not very satisfying to use

* **The Global Cooldown:** I didn't mind it at first, but then after looking at the actual reduction, it's minimal.  Even with Greased Lightning at 3 stacks, it doesn't look like it will make the combat any more fast paced.  

* **The Number of Skills:** They've clearly put a lot of thought into the skills, but after using it 1000 times to kill mobs it loses it's allure.  I know that I'm used to having a million abilities thrown at me in other MMOs but it feels a bit lacking here.  

* **FATES scaling:** I feel as though FATES should scale down based on the level of participation to some degree.  (especially when it comes to the BAMs) Sometimes I have only two people helping me and it takes a very long time to kill it

Please share your thoughts!  

(P.S: has anyone seen a post on Conjurer not being able to cast Cure on a recently raised party member/other?  They're targetted but it won't cast on them for a degree of time)
