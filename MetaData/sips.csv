I would like to bring attention to (and celebrate) the fact that Sips clearly is a feminist icon making influential contributions to the feminist discourse. I have included a short analysis of the Skyrim play-though as evidence of this claim. 

Firstly

At same time she’s a single mother of two and is balancing a professional carrier as a whore/ arch-mage/adventurer with a family life.*Now that’s a relevant feminist narrative if I’ve ever seen one!*

While being a single mother she has still created a family consisting of strong women and together they are raising the children - and teaching Lucia to be fierce knife wielding adventurer. 

Also

Obviously Sips has carefully planned out this story

What are your thoughts on Sips as a feminist icon?

Our magnificent bastard has conquered the survival of himself, exploration, combat, humour and creatures that resemble Big Butts. You'll start off as a cell based organism and climb the evolutionary ladder to the top of the food chain where your species will begin the retailing of pure dirt on the inter-galactic market.

I'd love to see Sips play this game, the empire you build and the adventures you go on are all the perfect formula for a great YouTube series, and with the success of Skyrim and other open world games, I think it's obvious that people want to see Sips play games that HE enjoys, with an emphasis on open world games where he can create his own adventure and story.

Please note: This is *not* about the crazy edits, no discussion needed, they are the smelly paint in our dirty beards, the 'Living on a prayer' in our collective Bon Jovi Concert. 

No

Let me explain what I mean by sidetracking a little: How many people watched your 'Random Skyrim Chores' video on twitch where basically all you do is running back and forth, but I think it's the twitch video that got the most viewers. How many people asked for a 'Building Lake View Manor' video instead of doing it completely off camera in the last few days? And why is it that people want to see this not-so-fast-paced-and-content-loaded stuff?

Because it's a part of Princess Leia's life, getting to love a character is not only to see them succeed but also to see them struggle, to see them fail, basically to see them **live**. That's what connects you to a character, be it in literature, cinema or games.

I can see the point in not showing a second run through an empty Haemar's shame to get to Clavicus Vile again, but this is really not about big stuff, like that, or building a house or whatever, it's the small things. I feel that a lot of what you showed in the early episodes of Skyrim and what made it 'fluid' and made it flow would have just been cut out if it came out as an episode now. We were adventuring with you and Leia early on and we loved it, we were picking flowers and upgrading our gear together. Now .. well, it feels more like 'ChinchillaDave's Skyrim Adventures' ever so often. (which I love btw, but you'll see what I mean - different style)

I'm getting to the point now. It's the little things: Cutting switching to a different shout/spell. Cutting looting a single chest. Ransacking a room: Either cutting it all out or making 3 cuts out of it where each one shows you facing a different direction of the room. Cutting dialogue, it can be beneficial to compress a dungeon run, but if it's overdone like cut after cut after cut .. sometimes, you feel like you lose connection to the character. It's not only about getting to the end, it's about enjoying (and living) the journey.

The only reason I forced myself to type this wall of text anyway is the first episode of your Dishonored playthrough. Please don't do it like this

I know, please speak up now and let me know or let the guy himself know.

I am counting on you leaving a comment with your opinion on this matter

Thank you and your tushie.

Much has been discussed in these pages recently on the subject of bucket-deaths (and the Jarl of Falkreith has this morning hung educational posters about his hold advising citizens on proper bucket placement so as to avoid it falling), so it was with some reticence that I met Nick for a quick mead at the docks.

According to the wiki,888 Don't Starve days left until he reaches Day 1 million. Some basic division tells us that Sips has roughly 15.2 years of constant Don't Starve playing to reach day 1 million. This is quite some time, but not an inconceivable length of time. 


*However*, this increases the total time for him to reach his goal massively:



- every video is roughly 4 Don't Starve days 

- Sips uploads a video ever 2 IRL days

- Every 2 IRL days = 4 DS days

- Every 1 DS day = .5 IRL days



So, it will take him one million divided by 2, or around 500,000 IRL days to reach day 1 million, assuming of course Sips continues to post regularly and for a regular amount of time each video. **500,000 days is roughly 1,369 years.**

The only possible explanation for Sips being able to create videos for such a huge length of time is that in the next few decades scientists are going to discover an immortality serum,,False,,t5_2uts5,False,,True

It was the end of another long week at the SipsCo offices, was still working hard, trying to sort out the last few bugs before their new game came out.

The game was called “Call of Judy: Flailing on the phone.”. In honesty the game had failure written all over it. What kind of person would buy a Medieval/Action-RPG game about a mysterious woman

Eric was frustrated that he couldn’t fix a game breaking glitch

“Eric

“You know

“No I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“We need a name for our little group to have Drew.”

“How about that!?” He exclamed and pointed at the sign.

The aim of the game is to enjoy at least one Sips video while enjoying a beverage of your choice (though actually chocolate milk is mandatory). The general idea is to consume some of your beverage whenever you notice a classic ""Sipsism"". Two modes exist; casual mode

**Casual Mode Rules**

In casual mode

* Plays additional music
* Zooms / cuts to another scene
* Annotates an additional word / phrase on screen
* Roleplays (e.g. talks to an NPC

Additionally

* ""Not the best"" or ""Fantastic""
* ""Aw [insert Sips' term for poop]"" or ""Holy [insert Sips' term for poop]""
* ""Look at this / that""
* ""Right in the butt""
* ""Anybody? Just me? Maybe my mum / dad?""
* ""It's gotta be said""
* ""Too too much"".


**Hardcore Mode Rules**

In hardcore mode

* Plays additional music
* Zooms / cuts to another scene
* Annotates an additional word / phrase on screen
* Roleplays (e.g. talks to an NPC

Additionally

* Poo (including exclamations)
* When he describes how good something is (e.g. ""Not the best"",
* Any phrase that directs your attention to something
* Butts
* Sips' parents
* Films; real


Optional rule:

* Several Sipsisms occuring at the same time or in succession require an extra consumption.

Feel free to change rules, pick a few from the list to run with, or mix and match between casual and hardcore modes. Naturally some rules are more applicable to some games than others; he doesn't roleplay much in SimCity, or describe how good things are in Skyrim very often. I think they all sort of balance out though. You may need to change the rules for older videos where the Sipsisms are a bit different.

If left to grow, and it doesnt rot IIRC.

What you should do with this is make a spider farm. Plant spider eggs from killing either a huge spider nests or a spider queen. Plant them close to the fleshy bulb once it has grown out a bit. It will attack spiders and eat the monster meat, making it an easier source of silk.

One, was also braving the storm with tremendous courage. Meanwhile the fleshy meat-sack of muscle and metal shivered in her iron boots

Echoing off the rocky cliffs were the sounds of only pain and of desperation. Winds whipped and cut at the sides, soft ground and the clanking of the tired caribou warrior rattled along the path, each step seeming heavier than the last. To break the silence and dullness of the road trip, a small grey fox patted out of broken and beaten bushes, blocking the path. Before it could realize the mistake it had made, its fur became engulfed in flames and its body was flung through the air, like some sort of fireworks show. The lizard started laughing with a devious grin carved across her reptilian face. Her humor enticed the hellish apparition to let out a deep, but it could not reach the hollowed soul of the caribou warrior - killing humans was much more fun for her.

Alas, rang across the arid sky and burrowed deep into the adventurers’ ears. The caribou was first on the draw, her bow already high and eager to launch furies of pain at its target. “Oh my god Uthgerd, it happens every single time!” yelled the reptilian woman in a strangely masculine voice. Uthgerd, as she must have been called, didn’t pay any attention to the scaled mage’s cries; instead she had her eyes locked on the sky and was waiting for her enemy to appear. The apparition was a bit casual about the whole ordeal and never once gave a look of shock or fear, just gently raised one flaming hand to the night sky.

The white clouds hid the roar’s true form, but now this one had the advantage. Quickly, they all tried to get their footing and prepare for the attack. At long last, a dark shape formed behind the gray clouds, still cloaking the beast in shadows. Another screech sliced through the air. Then another. The clouds broke, the ground shook, and the jaw of a magnificent monster came inches from Uthgerd’s face; the apparition swears he saw the caribou warrior spit on the dragon. Drool dripped from the tongue and cheeks of the snarling giant, darkness hidden within him. The foul smelling breath soon overpowered their noses.

In that short instance while the dragon had jumped at Uthgerd

In a burst of purple flames, before summoning him back to the living world in the same ghostly fires he left. Satan still seemed unaffected by the change of events and let loose a volley of fireballs into the air, trying to locate his target and lighting up the gray sky. Meanwhile, Uthgerd paced around stupidly in a circle with her bow drawn, not wanting to miss her chance to strike.

Rocks tumbled down onto the lizard and the mountain was shook to its core. After regaining her balance, “Uthgerd, pick up the slack will ya?” She responded quickly and fired one arrow after another right into the butt of the dragon. Satan’s hellish fire sunk into the dragon’s scales and tore away at its flesh. Unable to withstand the beating, the dragon fell off of his perch up high on the mountain and tumbled down the rigid rock sides until it landed far beneath the travelers.

“Aw, “I wanted that guy’s soul. Well no matter, we’re almost to the top.” The lizard started talking about what she was going to do next, explaining things that seemed obvious; but she was talking to herself. This was normal for her to do and her companions had learned not to say anything, though her constant babbling made Uthgerd believe she was possessed. Uthgerd once told this to Satan who merely laughed and turned away. Speaking of Satan, he once again vanished with his purple explosion of heat.

Once they reached the top it became clear that they were not the only ones who had to deal with the dragon’s fury, but the caribou warrior was saddened that she could not be the one to have dug her blade deep into the flesh of these worthless thieves and killers. This made her anxious to continue on into the bandit lair and delve deep inside the mountain, but the mage; who had been overturning the bodies in search of loot, expressed her desire to rest.

The sun had set fully during the attack, Uthgerd could only nod when her companion asked her to carry some books; the unbroken woman was suffering of a broken heart. “Okay!” said the Argonian joyously as she set down the last bucket on the bandit’s head, “I think six hours of sleep will be good enough, don’t you Uthgerd?” Uthgerd said nothing, “See, look at Uthgerd, she probably doesn’t even sleep

The lizard laid down on her bedroll and closed her eyes, vicious images filled her head. A miller woman, blood pouring out of her neck, filling the room and drowning Uthgerd. Satan just hovering over her, laughing and laughing his deep hideous laugh. That woman’s expression, from so tough and protective to utter fear. Then to nothing. The woman screamed and screamed, then bled. “How could you do this to her Uthgerd!” “What is wrong with you!” Uthgerd couldn’t take it, the woman didn’t deserve it

She woke up in a cold sweat and tried to go to a happier place. She thought of the first time she met her love
 
Uthgerd was sitting in The Bannered Mare, trying to block out her rage and anger at the companions, and at herself. A cold wind blew as the door slid open. The most beautiful woman Uthgerd had ever seen walked in. She had a stride that showed true power, but yet she was gentle and kind. Leia walked around and talked to some other people first, sending a shot of jealousy up Uthgerd’s spine so when it came time to talk the lizard, she made sure to act as tough as she could, be as strong as she could.
	
Leia said something about a woman named Sarah Connor and made small talk, though only betting a little gold, really was betting her loyalty. If this slim Argonian could beat her, she would follow her wherever she may go. With the final blow, when Leia won the fight, Uthgerd knew that this feeling she had must be real. Leia approached her and asked for her help, so quickly Uthgerd responded, Uthgerd looked longingly at the special room she had rented at the inn.

Deep in hell, most would fail and bring him to Tamriel with only half of his full strength. So he was surprised when he was shifted over to the living world, amazed by the strength of his master. But he was still angry that his simplified form, a form her made so that he could remain stable among the land of the living and not explode into a nuclear disaster, still looked very feminine. Maybe one day the arch-mage could summon him in his real true form, but for now he enjoyed his time on the battlefield.

As the sun rose and Leia awoke, the Devil himself stood before them. Together, they were strong enough to take on whatever challenges were set out for them, together they could take Skyrim by storm. But that’s a story you’ll have to wait and see for yourself. In the meantime, let’s turn on the Spark Mandrill theme. As loud as she could, the Argonian prostitute yelled, “Triforce activate!”

Some people here might have heard of the Maktotos, thought I would join. Life in Sips City became pretty rough for the Maktoto's the last couple of months, after my wife died on one of the famous Bon Jovi concerts, because she drowned in chocolate milk. There was some kind of huge party for our mayor, something with 1 million buds following him around the internet. Sadly, she didn't make it. After that, I had to sell our kids to Sipsville, so we can make some money.
 I'm living in a seedy motel at the moment, even tho there aren't even sharks in the mississipsi river.
Well, armed with nothing but a needle. That's even more useless, than it sounds like, so I'll take a nap. See ya buds, I hope we can all become great friends.

* You should take the marble flooring where you picked the﻿ evil flowers with the pitchfork  
* When you make a bird cage and feed the bird fruit/veg
* If you give the bird any kind of meat (apart from uncooked monster meat) it will give an egg. So you can feed it cooked monster meat and get a much more nutritional egg in return
* You can take the tall bird egg from old laser eye and hatch it! Place it next to the fire during the night but not during the day because it will cook! If you hatch it properly
* You didn't fertilize all the grass tufts! Missed one...

1) With regular livestream uploads we will get more regular Sips content. Perhaps a triple whammy a day. Two regular vids and a piece of the live stream.

2) With more videos being watched Sips gets mo money. Mo money means mo time. Mo time means mo videos or mo editing. Everybody wins.

3) Youtube uploading is slow and unreliable. Uploading in chunks is much less likely to cause issues and delay the videos.

4) Addiction is a major issue when it comes to Sips videos. A full live stream upload may result in enjoyment overdoses.

Hey there. As some of you may know

Now, a song, an animation - WHATEVER. You don't have much time left! I will give you until midnight GMT of June the 8th to make something for him. I want this to be his best and most supported birthday ever. 
I mean c'mon

Now to the prizes! 
There are 9 prizes in total. I bought the latest Indie Bundles 3 times. I used all of the codes I received as give-aways to the Sips comunity so far. Most of them went to the Sipslam (steamgroup of me and some friends) and some I gave out on his twitch tv channel. For nothing at all. 

Now this time
I will try to get Sips to vote on the 9 best entries. I don't know how he will vote, I will. I have experience with both comedic writing and art and animation on a professional level. That being said, I hope that bastard agrees to judge! 

Here are the prizes and here's how it will go down. First place gets to choose first

So what are you waiting for. Animation, remix, art - anything goes. Post it in THIS subreddit thread. If you don't post it here, it won't be alegable to win any of the prizes mentioned above. 

and most of all **HAVE FUN**

A reboot would be fantastic.. Think about it, we can assume Sips has gone off the deep end and has spend all of Sipsco's money on none other then **BIG WOMEN**. He begs Sjin to come back to Sipsco to help rebuild the company. When Sjin returns, most of the compound is destroyed and Sips has locked himself on the top floor of Sipsco HQ.

1374285149.0,1io6xc,Just an idea...,Jadavis123,21,6,1,"Hey buds. So I was just thinking about all the fantastic Game Dev Tycoon inspired games that people are making, etc. ideas in my mind because I had nothing better to do. Here's what I have so far.

Story: In ""To Place a Bucket, people started noticing that this was becoming less of a rarity, and to avoid suspicion, you retired and went into hiding.

Now, and the hunt for the bucket murderer is back on. You set out to stop this nonsense, breaking out the old bucket. You eventually find out that it is Princess Leia: the Dragonborn, the Archmage of the College of Winterhold, and the most fantastic lizard wizard prostitute in the lands to name a few, who has been framing you. Your thirst for revenge is greater than your thirst for justice, so you set out to eliminate her. 

Gameplay: I was picturing it as a pixellated sidescroller stealth game, guns. Each level would be a different bandit cave, or guard tower, or something like that. You would either have to interrogate someone or get rid of them. In the case of the latter, you would have to find the designated bucket and use it on the target. The former would be simpler: just get to the target and get the information from them, then kill them.

Throughout the rest of the level, and they will blend into their surroundings, making other guards not notice them. You can also use a dagger to silently kill them, but other guards will notice and search for you if they come across the body. You can also use the dagger in combat if you are detected, however it is not very effective and will attract nearby enemies.

That's basically what my mind was occupied with this whole evening. You may be wondering, it really is just that - rambling. I just thought I'd share this idea with you, through this subreddit, the only valid place to post it, in the safe hands of the buds. I don't know much about coding or making games, so if anyone who does sees this, you're welcome to use the idea if it interests you. But either way, seriously.",t5_2uts5,True
