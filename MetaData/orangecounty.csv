In the first video, takes her sweater off, wraps the box up in it, and leaves. I'm a little weirded out by the fact that doing so took her at least 30 seconds; I have the feeling she was trying our door and trying to peer through the blinds.

I find it especially funny that the box she stole contained a 13 lb bag of baking soda (for our pool). I picture her and her friend opening it

Anyway, but I feel I gotta at least do my part.

**A little introduction:** If you haven't heard

&gt; an extra day of magic for you called “One More Disney Day.” For the first time ever, February 29 to 6 a.m., March 1, 2012, local time, you can fill the extra day of leap year with a marathon of Disney Parks fun.

So we decided

Now, wouldn't you like to go on [Splash Mountain while playing Chess](http://xkcd.com/chesscoaster/)?

We will meet together from 7:00 PM to 7:30 PM, you could spend the whole night there!

I forgot to mention

-----

**The Details**:

_Flagpole_**&amp;#8253;** _Where is the freakin' Flagpole_**&amp;#8253;**

It is the first thing you see when you enter from the Disneyland front entrance on Main Street. In fact

[This is what the flagpole looks like.](http://i.imgur.com/YKdwm.jpg)

There are plenty of benches and stuff

Via [BelieveInTheMagic](http://www.reddit.com/r/orangecounty/comments/o1rt0/reddit_disneyland_meetup_wednesday_february_29th/c3dowkm)

&gt; The flagpole is in the center of Town Square, it's the first place you come to when you enter the park.

&gt; People are free to come to the park earlier, but we scheduled the meet at the flagpole at 7:00 pm so people with dayjobs could make it.

&gt; I'll be there by 6:45 and wearing a very bright orange shirt and maybe a Reddit button. Feel free to message me if you need more info as we get closer to the big day!

&gt; Looking forward to seeing everyone (or at least everyone who is not at WDW in Florida) there!

The ideal situation would be to get all of Southern California together in one big meetup location. We happen to be in the middle of LA and SD so we would be a good middle ground

Speaking of large groups, how much larger of a turnout should I expect?

The following ideas have been tossed around for global meetup day:

* Beach Bonfire
* Park
* Dave &amp;amp; Busters in Irvine

Neither the beach bonfire nor the park would allow for alcohol on the premises and while D&amp;amp;B would be a great central location to include LA/SD, etc etc.

Sound off in the comments please. If anybody has a venue they could provide

I personally witnessed rocks, individuals throwing street cones at passing cars and women and men attacking media cameras reporting at the event.

I'm now watching further coverage on the news and hoodlums have now destroyed the front glass of a Starbucks

Whether or not the police used excess force on these recent shootings is still up in the air. Multiple sources have stated that the last individual stole a car, we don't know, and it's not our place to encourage vigilante justice. Let the courts and jury decide - we can't continue to encourage hoodlums from being our jury, justice and executioner. 

I've been noticing recently that the trend in this sub has blind hatred for the police. As citizens, rocks, cones, or vandalism toward them. 

I truly challenge any one feeling that this sort of vigilante protest is accomplishing any constructive action to reconsider their perspective. This act of opportunism at its worst isn't helping any sort of change. Most importantly,False,self,t5_2rd9x,1343201716.0,best,,t3_x46vf

I just wanted to follow up on global meetup day.

It will be located at:
Irvine Regional Park
GROUP AREA 4
1 Irvine Park Road
Orange

One of our members has kindly outlined our group area in [this map](http://i.imgur.com/AY583.jpg)

Per park rules

Parking costs $5

There is a grill on site for those who want to cook - but we do
suggest that you bring grilling equipment if you have some just
because there are at least 5 Redditors who are planning to bring to
cook on site.


If you're still undecided on what to bring
up sheet and found that we could still use more of the following:

* Coolers
* Ice
* Water (we'll probably need more than we think because it's going to
be a hot day and soda's going to dehydrate everyone)
* Disposable plates
* Probably more disposable utensils
* Picnic blankets
* Umbrellas or something to provide shade
* Charcoal
* Propane
* Lighter
* Extra grilling equipment (just in case since there seems to be a lot
of people who are intending to cook on site)

If you have any more questions

Sorry that it took so long to get this post typed up

Anyway

It looks like the general consensus for global meetup day is a beach bonfire at Corona del Mar. A few of us will arrive earlier in the day to stake out a fire pit for redditors' use. Everyone is welcome to join us for this part if you enjoy the beach during the day! 

The beach does close at 10pm so those interested in bar hopping can do so at that time. 

With that said, or giant beach umbrellas that we could use? Could you fashion a giant reddit alien so we can all find each other? Can you offer to carpool? Anything to make a beach day and bonfire more fun for everyone! :)

Please RSVP on either the [redditgifts event](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/global-meetup-day-orange-county-ca/) and [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=203864656321551) to help gauge a headcount. We're also around on IRC if you just wanna chat.

See you guys on June 25th!

I've been OC for a minute and have had an okay time in orange county as far as checking out clubs and bars. Anyone have some good ones that are hidden and have some amazing music. Most of the places I like to go to I judge by how good the music

Some great places I've encountered with links:

Commissary Bar - Costa Mesa: [Commissary Bar](http://commissarystores.com/)
Great drinks and they play hip hop and funk for the most part but once or twice a week throw a club night...nice loungy feel. **It's pretty good on most nights

Detroit Bar - Costa Mesa: [Detroit](http://detroitbar.com/) Right next to the bar below, and Talib Kwali just to name a few. **Check the schedule, this place can be a dud for sure!**

Avalon Bar - Costa Mesa: [Avalon Bar Yelp](http://www.yelp.com/biz/avalon-bar-costa-mesa) Nice spot for casual drinks and a bit intimate...tons of hipsters (4 Dollar brown bag is right price for getting drunk) and every once in awhile they will pull a DJ or producer with some good music

The Crosby - Santa Ana: [Crosby](http://thisisthecrosby.com/) Great spot to drink and they have some really legendary people roll by sometimes. Tons of great electronica and future beats (My Hollow Drum, OBEY) **CHeck their calendar but usually wednesday - Saturday are sure fire shows! Good networking opportunities!**

Commonwealth Lounge - Fullerton: [Commonwealth Lounge](http://www.commonwealthlounge.com/) This place has some great music and acts
**

Envy Ultra Lounge - Fullerton: [Envy](http://www.envyultralounge.com/) Awesome spot

XO Lounge - Westminister: [XO](http://www.yelp.com/biz/xo-lounge-westminster) Not the biggest

Kitsch Bar - Costa Mesa: [Kitsch](http://www.kitschbar.com/) I dig this bar because its loungy

MESA - Costa Mesa: [Mesa](http://juniper.nowsprouting.com/mesa/) This is a cool bar if you are looking to vibe and listen to some great electronic music and have that really nice L.A. vibe without all the BS. The music is good they have some really good DJs here that do some good mash ups and djing. Occasionally they bring in the punk/indie Japanese artists or other random out-of-country artists. Definitely check it out the deco is stylish. Fires burn between booths



And then you have your clubs like Heat, warehouses, beach houses etc)

[SANDY; the dog I found in a Sand Trap](http://imgur.com/a/0JmJ0#0)

[UPDATED PICS OF SANDY](http://imgur.com/a/G4bXB)

I was out golfing with my wife on Saturday at a little municipal course in Santa Ana, stray pitbull/boxer mix?  

She was walking up and down the driving range

I knew I had to help...

My initial plan was to just take her to a no-kill animal shelter… However, 1 bag of chips, and 3 hours, she would only get close enough that if I reached out as far as I could and she leaned in as far as she could, she could grab the little bit of food from my hand!

Anyway, I walked up to her (as I had done time and time again) and for some reason this time, instead of running away, she just sat there and let me put the tie around her neck) 

I couldn’t take her to a no-kill shelter after that

Since bringing her home

She asks to be pet, she plays well with my two other dogs, she’s housetrained, etc.  She’s also super mellow!

We took her to the vet on Sunday, posted pics on the internet, etc. and it doesn’t seem like anyone is looking for her.

We can foster her for a little bit

I was hoping Reddit might 1) know of some specific forums or communities that might be able to assist us

Thanks so much

P.S. a bit more information

* Sweetest dog I have ever met (all she wants in the world is to be pet (and food)).
*  Loves my other dogs and plays well with them... They've even switched bowls mid-eating without so much as a growl!
*  She's really mellow
*  House-broken... She whines when she needs to go outside... right now she likes me to wait outside with her
* House-trained... Initially, etc.  However, my dogs have no boundaries in the house, so she now will put her paws on the couch etc., but will drop down if you say no.  It's been hard not letting her sleep on the couch/beds, but we figure it will help her find a home. 
* Is smart... we've been calling her Sandy, so I imagine she could be trained to do anything.
* Sleeps while riding in cars (the two times that we've had her in a car).
* I'm working on crate-training her
* She LOVES dry dog food; not that big of a fan of dental type bones...
* She's a pretty malnourished
* She lived on the streets, etc. on the edge of stuff, her survival reaction is to grab it... she's done this exactly once... I told her no.  She stopped chewing the chicken breast and let me remove it from her mouth!
* She is not spayed (but several agencies I’ve talked to said that if I find her a home
* She doesn't seem to know basic commands
* She pulls on a regular collar/leash.

I've been looking for a job for the last three months now and thus far haven't been able to get anybody to call me back.  I know my resumé isn't great but there's not much I can do about that unless I have another job to put on it.  I've had one interview at Sears (it was automatically scheduled at the end of the application process) and it didn't go well because the interviewer didn't seem to have a personality at all.  Anything I'd say was met with indifferent or completely disinterested stares.  

I quit my last job (the Yogurtland in RSM) on the first of January because my manager was making me work 8-11 hour shifts meant for two people all by myself without warning and with no extra compensation.  He would also not pay for overtime that I worked.  It got to the point where I was angry all the time and couldn't relax so I quit.  I felt much better for the first week or two but after that I've regretted it.  Since then I've been surviving off the last of my savings bonds and doing my Mom's yard work for 25 bucks a week.  Right now the deal is that if I can get a job before the end of the month my Mom will give me enough money for next month's rent as my birthday present. (June 9th)

EDIT: The resume looks much better now mostly thanks to gehzumteufel but google docs is screwing with the formatting when I upload it.  Job preferences are anything somebody will pay me for besides sex or hurting myself.  I can't take much pain and I doubt I'm very good at sex.

The spreadsheet mentions carpooling, etc.

A useful tip someone posted about parking: 
&gt;I always head down Marguerite (off of highway 1) and park on Ocean. If you turn left onto Ocean from Margeurite, you will notice there is paid parking ($15) down there. If you're willing to pony up the cash, this is obviously the best. Street parking is my preference 9/10 times. Make sure you go right onto Ocean!

All the cats are adorable, playful, and affectionate. They love to cuddle and sit in your lap. We wish we could keep them, but apartments usually don’t allow that many cats and our living situation is about to change.

* [Breakfast with Strangers](http://breakfastwithstrangers.com) 
* [Our video for the project](http://vimeo.com/43216845) 

If you are interested then please email us at breakfastwithstrangers@gmail.com and let us know in 500 words or less why you'd be the awesome breakfast interview as we travel across the USA for 5 months this summer. We posted a few months ago our beta version and had a ton of great responses from the Reddit community. We will be in Cali during the late fall/early winter and looking to find great people now. 

**The Details &amp; Route**

On July 18, ME and all places in between. Our camper van will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. 

Throughout our journey, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, pure chance

**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America.

**The Conversation:**

This journey is a conversation. We’ll skip the small talk and ask the big questions

* www.breakfastwithstrangers.com
* www.facebook.com/BreakfastWithStrangers
* twitter.com/#!/BWS50Meals

**The Outcome:**

At the end of our trip we’ll select 50 breakfasts to highlight in our book

The most important outcome of all: the reminder that we are all part of a larger community.
Thanks for your consideration

She was very attentive and knowledgeable while looking over the items from the estate.  She answered the phone when I called and she never was late for an appointment.  I had no reason to suspect that anything was wrong.  Janet called me at the end of March to tell me that she had sold off all of the items from the estate and that I would be receiving a check and information about the sale within 5 business days.  This all seemed fine because the contract stated that ""accounting shall be available within 5 business days of the completion of the sale"".  Janet had told me that the sum was approximately $3

That was when everything went wrong.  I waited patiently for the check to arrive.  I gave the post office time in case they were delayed.  After several weeks I realized something was wrong.  I called her many times in April to check she never answered her phone and she never returned a single voicemail I had left for her.  

At the end of April I contacted the police and they told me that they had no recourse.  They suggested that I sue in civil court.  I contacted my lawyer and was informed that the legal fees would likely total to a sum greater than the value of the estate  I decided that suing was an additional waste of my money and came to the conclusion that I just had a learning experience.

I do, make sure you take a full itemized inventory of everything being sold as well.  I failed to do that and cannot remember every single knick-knack that was sold.  Don't let yourself fall victim to this woman like I did.

I wanted to update you on the status of our mission to KEEP the fire pits in Newport Beach. The city of Newport Beach has sent their permit request to the California Coastal Commission and there will be a meeting taking place to give a FINAL verdict on the matter on March 6th, to be present at this meeting and let your voice be heard.

I have already been notified that NUMEROUS individuals from the opposition will be there to speak and the more time they get to plead there case the less of chance we will have to prevail.

If you can make it

From Orange County Take the I-5 S 
Take exit 21 to merge onto Sea World Dr/Tecolote Rd
Continue to follow Sea World Dr
Merge onto W Mission Bay Dr via the ramp to Ingraham St/Mission Beach 
Take the ramp onto W Mission Bay Dr
Destination will be on the right

This will be your LAST CHANCE to be heard and to save the fire pits from permanent removal.

The Coastal Commissions' staff have put together the preliminary findings and their recommendation to the Commission is that the permit be DENIED to The City Of Newport Beach which is GREAT NEWS you can read the full report

Some of you may remember us from the trainwreck of a thread we proudly created here on the subreddit last week. 

We'd like to thank r/OrangeCounty for all of the constructive feedback and trolling we received. Without you we'd probably still be floundering around trying to figure out which one of many reasons we weren't getting bookings. Now thanks to your input on more reasonable prices and more we've actually scheduled appointments. 

We've been working on this project for about two months now and were following a lot of advice around Reddit on how to approach things but not specifically within Orange County. Your responses to our site the day we debuted completely hammered into our brains plenty of useful information and edits we felt necessary to make immediately. 

Primarily

http://fastfriendlyspotless.com/what-we-do/

We originally were charging $119 for a 1 bedroom to give you an idea of how much we dropped the price.

Most of our other changes were design type issues such as drawing a little more attention to our booking button and other little things. 

In other news

On a final note we'd again like to offer Redditors a discount if they're interested in our services. You guys can use the code ""ThanksOC"" to save 10% on any cleanings you need.

I'm 27 and he's 28

He is in the process of interviewing for the transfer that seems most likely he'll get. I, because we'll have to be out there within a month or two.

**Housing** 

* I've been doing some digging and found that most people seem to be recommending Costa Mesa

* What's the average rent I can expect living out there for a 2 BR apartment? We don't need anything big or fancy

* Anywhere else people would recommend? Anywhere I should avoid with concerns as to rent being too high

* Money is a slightly big factor


**Jobs**

* Though my partner has a job waiting for him

* Would it be hard to find a job fairly quickly out there

* I have a Bachelor's Degree in Advertising and Art Studio (double major) and an Associates Degree in Graphic Design

**Travel**
I know there's going to be a lot traveling

**Stuff to do**
Like I said before, Middle Eastern, BBQ, my bf could live off sandwiches, and I'd love to find somewhere Paleo friendly. 

Also what about the beaches? I hear they're very close

**Etc.** I have a ton of other questions like good (inexpensive) gyms, tea, and beer, what the gay scene is like, is everything really that much more expensive out there or is it just rent, or anything else I should know.


Thank you OC redditors

**TL;DR** Strong possibility me and partner moving to OC in the next month or two. Know absolutely nothing about the area. In desperate need of places to live and work. What should I expect in rent and whats a decent living wage to expect? Having minor freak out.

This is a call for action. This is a call for help.

I live in Irvine, where the awful sounds of confused souls spouted bigotry at innocent citizens on February 13th. Those voices will be heard again. I’m in a position to help speak louder, so damn it to hell, I am going to try.

People who follow the mass media will hear the louder voice. The louder voice, becoming increasingly louder, and is repeated far too often for comfort. The Yorba Linda video isn’t a singular case or the beginning of something, it is simply one example.
Protests around the nation are organizing against the construction of houses of worship and community centers. There has been at least one case of vandalization in one’s construction. The citizens of Oklahoma recently found it necessary to pass an amendment banning the establishment of Sharlia law. This illustrates perfectly the terror many of the citizens of this country feel against a political boogeyman

Something needs to be done.

So this is a call for action. This is a call for a return to reason, and actually want to make a change, an anonymous upvote on the internet isn’t enough. Life isn’t virtual. Life is actually happening. And we need to actually do something if we want to make a change in the national voice.

I am not going to say,” because that does not apply to me. I am mostly white, I was baptized Presbyterian when I was 11, and I am male. I am not going to be persecuted in this country in my lifetime. What I will say is, they are coming for the Muslims, and I choose to speak out because everyone has the right to follow his or her own path of self actualization. So please understand where I am coming from when I ask for your help. Perhaps you will be affected. Perhaps not. But this doesn’t matter. I feel solidarity with these poor souls for one reason and one reason alone: they are human, and so am I.

Let us make the first steps of a long commitment to ending hatred. Use this thread. Help organize here. Help organize beyond here. Let’s not let this be solely a Reddit thing, inform your synogogue or mosque or whatever atheist community you belong to, or anything in-between. It’s all the same when you believe in equality.

Let’s not let laziness or apathy stop us. It’s easy to “tsk tsk” something and go about on your daily routine. But if you actually believe you would have marched with Martin Luther King given the chance
Let’s march in bigger numbers. Let’s let the rational voice snowball larger than that of hate.

Frightened people do terrifying things, words of encouragement. Words of comfort. Words of equality.

Help. Because it’s the right thing to do.

We'll stay all day: swim, have a few drinks, relax, whatever we want to do, then have bonfire at night.

I live in the I.E. and that's mainly where our group is coming from, ""Why not invite some Orange County redditors too?""

The amount of area in a 54 x 54 inch pizza is 2916 square inches. A large Little Ceasar's pizza is 153.938 square inches.

It has now been over 24 hours since our event ended, and I'm still finding sand everywhere, but it was all so worth it for such a great event. Thank you for showing up and having a great time. Thank you for bringing food, sustenance, and ""apple juice."" Thank you for those who brought board games (apples to apples!) and other beach activities. Thank you for being patient and waiting with us despite our initial lack of firepit. 

To those who showed up to their first meetup ever: Thank you for tearing yourselves away from the computer for a day and forcing yourself to see the California sun. To those who have regularly showed up to previous meetups: thank you for not being sick of us yet and showing up again :) I met so many wonderful

I have a feeling I'm starting to sound absolutely redundant and like a bimbo pageant queen winner

**For those wondering about our next meetup:**

Please, and people will show up. Advertise on our [facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_108884965846148), subreddit, and tell our [IRC channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=reddit-oc).

Speaking of IRC, feel free to ask how. It's a great way to chat, keep in touch, and get to know your fellow OC Redditors.

Can't wait to see you all again at our next event!! :D

First, we sell more than 225,000. So though it sounds like a lot, it's small compared to the totals.

At the end of the sale, who disposed of them. NOT the Girl Scouts (like the news story implied), the bakers.

Well because of food laws and sue crazy people and the cookies changing hands

From information that Girl Scouts of San Gorgonio has shared, they belonged to ABC Bakers, which has a contract with that facility to store, distribute and dispose of cookies designated for Girl Scouts of San Gorgonio. ABC Bakers directed the warehouse to destroy the cookies as once cookies had left their control they could not be donated due to food safety concerns.

This television coverage is unfortunate given the thousands of cases of Girl Scout cookies donated each year to food banks and the military through our Cookie Share community service project. Girl Scouts of Orange County has not returned cookies to ABC Bakers which have later been destroyed. We work closely with our volunteers

 If you want to give a specific reason why, and unless they’re a supreme idiot or have been authorized to speak on the issue (highly unlikely), they will not be able to engage you very much.


The most information they will ask of you is your zip code - this is to find out if you’re a constituent living in their district. You are welcome to provide more information if you would like to get a letter or email in response to your opinions or concerns.


So what happens to this information? Well, or whoever is in charge of knowing what people are calling in about. Easy-peasy. Admittedly, offices that have very safe districts (little to no competition come election time) don’t really bother with doing this.


I also cannot emphasize it enough: BE POLITE TO WHOEVER ANSWERS THE PHONE, and normal labor laws do not apply to them. Be kind.


I saw a Reddit post that encouraged talking to the Legislative Correspondent (LCs) or Legislative Assistant (LAs) who work in the issue area. If you're living in a district with a small constituency, organizations or other government officials. If you want to take this route, prepare to be patient.



**WRITING YOUR CONGRESSMAN**


Writing your Congressman will not only engage him or her on an issue but solidly puts on you on record on where you stand. 


RESIST THE URGE OF USING EXISTING TALKING POINTS OR A FORM LETTER. If you send a form letter


Keep your letters concise, paper mail sent to Congress is irradiated and delays receipt by two weeks. If you insist on sending something on paper, drop it off at your local Congressional office. If you want to put it in an envelope, KEEP IT UNSEALED. Trust me, they take biological threats sent in the mail very, very seriously.


Here’s the secret if you REALLY want someone in an office to look at your letter: address multiple issues. Seems counterintuitive


Each Legislative Assistant (LA) in a Congressional office specializes on a limited of issues. For example

So if you write a letter with concerns in multiple issue areas

-----
There you have it. If you’re a person with loads of time and energy or not

I work for Second Harvest Food Bank of Orange County - a member of Feeding America. We are currently engaged in a voting contest, California. The money would be used to expand our Mobile Pantry program, specifically to work with more schools in Orange County. Our Mobile Pantry program sends a huge truck filled with food (a lot of fresh produce and other good items) to a location where the community can line up and walk through to receive bags of food for free. Many people think of Orange County as being an affluent area that doesn't deal with food insecurity, but I'm here to tell you that this is not the case. With your help, we can reach more people that are in need.

The contest is being hosted on facebook and if you click on this link: https://apps.facebook.com/walmartlocal/?applet=hunger&amp;organization=64

[Link to Original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/orangecounty/comments/19eijj/i_know_this_is_crazy_but_anyone_want_a_free_trip/)

So I never did find anyone who wanted to jump in the car with 3 strangers and embark on a crazed 5 day adventure across the grand old' US of A. Below will be the timeline of crazy shit and adventures that have happened on the way. Check back for future updates.

First off there are three people who are in this adventure,  My Father as RasT, and my co-worker as Ash.

I'll do my best to update this when I stop while driving back across the country but I'm not positive how often I can. I'm sure I will be dead tired.

Thursday 2/28/2013
 
14:30 RasT left from Oceanside heading north up the 5

14:45 Someone drives off the onramp on the Ortega causing CHP to have to shut down the on and off ramps for Highway 74. I'm waiting at my girlfriend’s house in SJC so the only way for him to get to me is to go through Dana Point.

15:45 Traffic was hell he finally arrives

16:00 - 18:00 we make our way north up the 5 drudging through the horrible rush hour traffic heading north to Diamond Bar to retrieve Ash.

18:20 Ash loads in and we set off.

18:25 the start of the troubles. RasT puts his headphones on as Ash passes out. I figure I should put mine on and reach behind me to grab them. I grab them pull them out of the floorboard then I notice the cable to be stuck. I give it a small tug and the cable comes free. But in my horror there is only one plug left on the end of the cable. Oh God... being a headset there are two plugs one for the Headphones one for the Microphone. Guess which one is left...yup you guessed right him one for the Microphone. So to start the trip off my $100.00 pair of headphones that I bought the week before is gone.

18:30-19:00 Find the closest Best Buy which is in Victorville

19:00-20:40 Drive till I see we need gas

21:00 we decide to continue on regardless and just find a store to buy a tarp. So we rush over to the nearest bigots, and bungiecords. Meanwhile RasT is outside on the phone with the insurance seeing if there is a place along the way where we can get the window replaced. I get back out side wake Ash who was asleep through this whole thing up and get him to help me attach the 15'x40' tarp to the back of our little SUV. Just as we unfold this huge thing all the way RasT informs us that there is a place here in Barstow that is open 24 hours and can replace our window. Sweet, so I run back inside 5 minutes before closing with a huge tarp unfolded in my hands and returns it.

You should have seen the look this cashier gave me.

21:20 we arrive at said glass place deep in Barstow

Well Shit

00:00-18:00 - We drove and drove and drove. Got from Flagstaff, pissed some piss, froze our ass off and decided to buy a Tarp to duck tape on over the hole where the back window should be. I can't even tell you how many fucking times I pulled off to fix that fucking tarp. 

Worst. 

Idea.  

Ever. 

Ended up taking it off and just packing the luggage up in the back enough to keep most of the wind out. But it really is freaking beautiful driving down the 40 though the north of all of the desert states. It's amazing how beautiful snow in desert/plains is. I wish I didn't do all the daytime driving so I could have taken more pictures.

18:00-00:00 I power down and sleep in the back of the car.

01:00 we pull over to get gas I wake up and get out of the car to notice that I seem to have lost my left shoe. I get out it's snowing my feet stick to the ground. Feelssobad.jpg 

01:00-06:00 I sleep more since when I get to Florida I have to hop in another car and drive right back across the freaking country. 

07:00 I decide to start typing this.

09:00 Got to my Great Aunts house to see my grandfather who I haven't seen in a few months. I knew he wasn't doing well but after getting there he stood up and fell down hurting himself. EMS was called and he is now in the hospital. God damn this trip has been fucking crazy!!!! 

10:00 now we are heading to our end destination of Tallahassee

12:00 Arive in Tallahassee and it’s fucking coooooooooold. Head over to pick up my car afraid that it may be looted, or whatever.(I left the car in a bad neighborhood where my friend lives.) but amazingly I pull around the corner and see it sitting there looking classy as always, a good bit dirtier that when I left it last year. Hop in the car stick the key in and it starts right up! Been sitting a year no need to jump it off or anything, man I love Volvo’s!!!

14:00 Go get the rest of my shit done and get ready to leave

16:00-21:00 Arrive at my favorite aunt’s house and sit down and start talking. Before I know it the night is upon me and I must stay over. I didn’t want to do this but it will help me last longer the next day.

03:50 Shit. I overslept 3 hours than I wanted to. Get all my shit together

06:00 Picked up my best friend to hang out with him for a while, and went inside to pick up some food for the trip and a SD card for my camera.
 They quoted me 20 minutes to change my oil.

06:35 Show back up at the TLE and ask if my car is done

07:20 Finally the guy pulls my car out and brings me the keys. I go to the counter and the lady can’t find the paper work. She calls the guy in and asks him where it is, Fuck wal-mart.

07:50 Dropped my friend off and headed out on the road to California.

**UPDATE 03/03/13 04:41**

12:08 Arrive in Alabama pull off, update this.

15:06 Pull off in Shreveport

15:30 I left you a present you fucking Volvo hating state!

16:30 See sign saying 45 miles to New Orleans

20:00 Finished crossing Louisiana

[My hotel for the night]( http://i.imgur.com/BeYYpPL.jpg)

20:00-03:30 Slept like a baby.

04:35 After drinking my first cup of tea I decide to pull off and get gas/breakfast. It’s amazing how strong the wireless transmitter at the Holiday Inn across the interstate is! I’m about half a mile away and I get 4 bars while sitting inside of a waffle house. As a network engineer I want to know what transmitter they have!

04:45 Heading out across Texas

**UPDATE 03/05/13 20:07**

04:45-13:00 Bored bored bored, driving. Man do I fucking hate texas

13:00 Hit my muffler on something and it rips off my entire exhaust system. So. Fucking. Loud.

13:45 I purchase a new muffler from Autozone and put it on with one of those crappy U-Clamp things. 

18:15 New muffler falls off :|

21:00 Now deaf and extraordinarily tired I pull off for some sleep at a Loves rest stop again. But only sleep for about an hour.

22:00 I wake up again and start driving. Just to realized how tired I really was. I drive from where I was to the end of Texas. I stop at the New Mexico welcome area and pass back out for another 6 hours.

Tuesday 3/5/13

04:00 Wake back up and hit the road. 

06:00 Eat food at the awesome TtT truck stop. Gotta love Omar's Hi-Way Chef.

06:30 - 12:30 Drive

12:30 Eat more foooooood

14:00 Reach my destination and man what a fucking crazy annoying wild trip it was. Just wish I had someone other than my shitty camera to share it with :c",self,t5_2rd9x,1362542851.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/orangecounty/comments/19iv1a/update_figured_i_owed_it_to_you_guys_so_here_is_a/

I leased a 2011 Volkswagen CC. Never used it. Decided to loan it to someone for 4 months until I was ready to move away from Los Angeles to make a little extra cash. The guy stopped paying when I asked for its return. Blocked my calls. I went through the materials he provided me, old credit report—all useless. Expired. Old addresses, etc.

Our agreement was all over email and texts. Police say they can't report it stolen, I've been up and down the police road with this)—they, both the police and my lawyer, advised me to find a PI/repoman/bounty hunter to track the guy down with the limited information I have and to just take the car back since I have a spare key and it's registered in MY name.

So I started looking for PIs and bounty hunters until someone suggested that maybe I use the many eyes of reddit to also be on the look out for the car. Using Spokeo I have several possible addresses, San Francisco, San Ramon (where a 2-year old address and address on his checks is), Alhambra and Las Vegas.

The car has no license plates. But he's driving it around. I'm going to post pictures of it

If you see this car somewhere

Reddit, buzzing ball of stress in my stomach and I sit there, heart pounding in my chest till I can fall asleep again. This is a nightmare. I'm responsible for anything this guy does with the car. I've already paid 2 parking tickets. And god forbid he hit someone, or kill someone. Please help me.

Additionally I have all supporting documents for anyone who is suspicious of me. My lease. My license. I can screen grab my account page with volkswagen with my name on the lease. And if we do find my car, the words this bastard texted me when I told him it was clear to me he was stealing my car and I was going to the police: Good luck.

**TL;DR:** 9/10 of law. I loaned my car to a con-man. He disappeared. Police can't report it stolen. Lawyer can't serve a man with no confirmed address that we can't find. My only hope is to find my car in the wild. Take it back with my spare key. The guy has taunted me and wants me to report it stolen so he can sue me for damages, heaps of love and eternal gratitude and become your lifelong brother like Dae Han in Best of the Best.

Fair warning right now -- sad pet story coming up. 

Hello! 

I'm cleaning house and finally getting rid of some of the comic books I've amassed over the years as we need the room. I don't think I can sell them for anywhere near what I had paid for them so I'm going to try an experiment and offer them up to my fellow OC Redditors using a ""pay (almost) what you want"" model for them. This is what I managed to dig up so far: 

* Fables 1 - 23
* Panku Ponk! 1 - 6
* Neil Gaiman's Eternals 1 - 5
* Elektra: Root of Evil 1 - 4
* Legends From Darkwood 1 - 4
* Battle Angel Alita: Last Order 1 - 6
* Bite Club 1 - 6
* 1602 2 - 8
* 1602 New World 1 - 3

Regarding the Fables collection

Now

* $1 minimum for any set except for the 1602 titles which I would consider as one set. 
* No picking and choosing of individual issues; you have to take the whole set. 
* Keep in mind that any money I get from this will help out with vet costs (see below). 

Now

She was my cat for a good 8 years and absolutely loved me. She would often greet me when I came home by flopping on to her side and rolling around so that I would rub her belly and whenever I went to bed, and if I caught her doing something bad, she would immediately run to the bedroom, lay down on the bed, and then pretend she had been there the entire time. [Here](http://imgur.com/ZOlIkbxh) is her ""Oh crap"" face as she tries to nonchalantly pass off the fact that I just caught her counter-surfing.

My friend's brother brought home a dog that his boss apparently didn't want anymore.  Fast forward a year later - the wife is nagging him to give the dog away due to a new baby and paranoia of allergies.  This dog is very sweet, and potty trained.  I told my friend to get him updated on his shots this past weekend and he's neutered.
 
My friend is not really a dog person but is trying his best to foster this dog until we can find a permanent home.  I have 3 dogs of my own
 
[Here are some photos of him!](http://imgur.com/a/LcPF2#0)

If you find that your situation changes or you change your mind


**EDIT:**  Thank you everyone for your interest.  I am determined to find Lawry (you can feel free to change his name) the right home.  I just got his medical paperwork from my friend so I wanted to update everyone.  He just received his DHPP (distemper, parainfluenza), bordetella, corona, &amp; rabies shots on the 29th.  He won't be due for his rabies until 2013 and everything else is annual.  He was also dewormed at the same time.  He is not microchipped so that is something that you would have to get done, so please keep that in mind.  

He is a pomeranian mix so he will require grooming when his is long and haircuts during the summer.  Please feel free to ask me anymore questions.  We can schedule meetups for you to meet Lawry or I can take him over to your place if there are kids and other pets that you would like to see a trial run for.

**2nd EDIT:** Sorry for the delay everyone.  The dog has been adopted by the first person that contacted me.  We had our first meet &amp; greet this Sunday and it seems like a good fit.

My girlfriend and I went hiking through Whiting Ranch yesterday and loved it (it's down the street from our apartment). I did a search on here and saw a thread about places to hike and there seems to be a lot of trails here in OC! 

It gave me an idea; what if we set up bi-weekly or monthly hikes as a meetup in different trails around OC? I think it would be a great way for all of us to get together and enjoy our beautiful weather.

What do you guys think?

**EDIT: Seems like we should be able to get a good group going. I encourage you all to recommend places each month :)**

**EDIT 2: WOW! A lot of people are down to hike. Well

**What day should we schedule the hikes? Every last Saturday or Sunday of the month maybe?**

As sad as it makes me
Felix is a very outgoing 3 year old standard grey male and his best friend Sneak is an inquisitive 2.5 year old violet male chin. (I will not separate them or part-out their cage/toys!)

They were both purchased by me from the same breeder (http://www.pets4love.com) soon after they were weaned. I had Felix for about six months before adding Sneak to the cage


They come with EVERYTHING one needs to keep them healthy and happy

* Quality Cage Co.'s ""Chinchilla Mansion""
* 14 inch exercise wheel
* corner litter pan
* glass water bottle/ceramic dish
* timothy hay box
* fleece hammock &amp; tube
* wooden tube/ledges
* marble tile
* dusting bowl (featured in video's below)
* tons of hanging toys

food/supplies:

* Mazuri chinchilla diet
* Kaytee timothy hay
* all natural aspen bedding
* Blue Cloud chin dust
* treats!
* window air conditioner (+$20 if needed)
* small animal moving crate



Because I want them to go to the right home I will only re-home them to someone who:

* is above the age of 21
* understands how to properly care for a chinchilla
* can give them a safe
* will keep them together in their current arrangement
* keep them cool w/ AC throughout the summer months
* let them out every other day/night and provide them with treats/toys/stimulation
* love them

price is negotiable if i feel that you will give them the love

[Go Goo Ryeo](http://gogooryeo.com/) allows reservations and has private rooms for large grops. They also have vents conveniently placed near their grill so you don't come out smelling like kbbq.

* I'll already be in Paris the month before

* Access to the insides of buildings was suspended in April after a minor incident with some tourists who were lightly injured. Contacts tell me that this may be reversed after the massive Euro football tournament is over this summer

Why do I mention the second item? Simply because I may decide not to go if the buildings aren't reopened. For someone who has never been there

If the buildings aren't reopened

If you're interested, experience, etc. 

TL;DR Who wants to glow in the dark?

I really didn't want to do this, as I am at a situation where I am super desperate. Why?

About myself/situation/request:

I'm a recent college grad, here's the dilemma I'm facing currently:

- my father and I am getting evicted from our home on January 31st. he and I will be be separating ways for now
- As of today
- missed all my bill payment this months
- matter of a fact, so I steal Starbuck's free wifi now w/o buying drinks.
- student loans are in process of deference application

Before you guys accuse me of being ""irresponsible with monies as college student, our family faced immensely difficult financial hardship compounded by the fact that we didn't have health insurance. If you are wondering how much I have in just credit card debt, I have accumulated over 10 grand over last 2.5 years. I am genuinely surprised to this day it isn't more because I was supporting my family financially while attending a university.

But as a student, full-time during vacations, did extremely odds jobs for supplement income, and took out student loans, which were used primarily supporting my family. For the last 3 years of my college years, I slept on the living room floor of my friends' house (bless them) for an extremely small fee to cut almost every single living expenses to a minimum.

However, it will be even HARDER to get a job (brutal tax season). I'm hoping for best, as I have been submitting my resumes and applying for odd gigs furiously, but in case it does not happen, I do not wish to just borrow money, because I do not know how soon I can pay you back.

So this is what I am requesting to you

Please give me a job. Any job. Anything. Part-time, labor jobs, creative jobs, ANYTHING. I can do construction work, as I have done before. I can do cashier/manual/physical labor, as I have done before. I can do tutoring, as I have done before. Essays? Analysis? Math? Marketing? Financial Modeling? Excel usage? Engineering? Carpentry? Data Entry? Marketing? Sales? Other stuff? I repeat, and most likely I can get it done. (Or die trying.) You need something done, after burning out completely from stress, debit cards

Of course, I am willing to do ANYTHING for money, and I will be forever grateful, and I will love you forever.

If you have any questions/comments/remarks/advice/suggestions/offer/condolences/hate speech/apathy/wedding proposals/etc/etc, please PM me so I can either link you or email you.

Thanks for reading!

tldr: i need money. getting evicted and i have no money. give me any kind of job, i rather not borrow money since i can't pay you back for at least a month or two.

When: 7pm - whenever

Where: Kitsch Bar - 891 Baker St


Last chance to wear your costumes this year! Show them off and possibly win a prize!


We will have a COSTUME CONTEST


We will be able to bring snacks to the bar before it gets more crowded (own
er says around 9)...so if you want to bring some, or no later than 8.


Our venue is a super awesome bar/lounge called Kitsch in Costa Mesa that we as redditors have been regularly attending for nearly 2 years. We know the owner and he loved it when we came there last year for halloween. It is 21+ ... so... I'm sorry people who aren't yet 21


This will not be an exclusive reddit-only night, etc. I would like to fill it with as many redditors as possible though, so please come EARLY (like right at 7pm if you can) take a seat and fill up the place so that if the bar gets too full, only non-redditors are turned away. It worked out pretty well last year either way. As incentive, I will have glow sticks and raffle tickets for the first people to come. Yes, there will be a RAFFLE as well.


I have many decorations

The reason why we are starting to search for a home for her is because we already had two cats when we adopted her.  We never really intended to have three cats, and he hasn't really been the same since she's been around.  He's been randomly peeing/pooing in places where he shouldn't, and it's starting to get out of control.  The other cat plays with her a bit, but she's a little older and on the husky side, so she has a hard time keeping up.  Maybe if I had a bigger home, or the option of letting my cats go indoor/outdoor, then things would be ok

It's going to be very hard for us to part with her

One park we went to quite often was a park that had this giant concrete structure that is difficult to describe.  I would say that it was a bridge, but that makes people think I'm describing something ornate, which is not the case.  It was just concrete.   I remember as a kid thinking it would be fun to skateboard on, but I don't think it was specifically designed for that.

We basically just walked across it and had various adventures There were a few things to interact with

Which might be why nobody else seems to have heard of it.  Every time I join some internet community and I find that there is an Orange County local section I ask, doesn't seem to know what I am talking about.  I'm starting to wonder if I hallucinated the whole thing.  

Along with the concrete structure it was a very large park with lots of things to do and some other fairly unique playground apparatuses.  It also had some playground equipment that seemed to have been converted from old planes.  

Unfortunately I can't remember the exact city.  We were in Santa Ana but traveled all around Orange County.    It's not Atlantis Park (first thing everyone suggests) and I'm pretty sure it's not Boysen Park (although the plane playground equipment I mentioned was similar, and one being much better than the other, and Boysen exactly matches my memory of the lame one), although we went to both of those places.

I'm just wondering if this rings a bell with anyone else?  If not it's cool.  I just think of this place once in a while and wonder if it's still there.  Or if it was ever there at all.",self,t5_2rd9x,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/orangecounty/comments/1gyhdp/help_locating_a_certain_park/

A while back I posted asking if anyone had info on accessing the blimp hangars at [MCAS Tustin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Corps_Air_Station_Tustin). I've got two updates:

First, but some info is available on their website. To join, it looks like you need to make at least a $25 donation to the conservancy. 

Second, but will approach a group tour soon. If you're a photographer and have interest in better access later, you may want to jump on the tour this weekend and make some mental notes of shot selection for next time. Let's keep our fingers crossed. 

As I understand it

**Edit**: The tour time will be at 10 a.m. If you want to gain access, so I should be easy enough to spot. ",,False,self,t5_2rd9x,True,,
