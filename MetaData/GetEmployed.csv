1371094231.0,1g8txq,"Finally, after 3 years of unemployment I got a job!",lfwork,38,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/1g8txq/finally_after_3_years_of_unemployment_i_got_a_job/

I will note that this job came almost entirely out of luck. Long story short

But I did learn some things in my 3 years of unemployment. I don't have a college degree and I quit my last job without a notice. Here's a few tips I've learned along the way...

- Always have a resume and really work on making your resume perfect. Even if you don't have a degree and you're not applying for anything fancy. A resume can single handedly make you stand out from other applicants and can really allow you to focus more on your strengths then any basic application can do. Of course

- Don't be afraid of annoying employer's but don't actually annoy them if that makes any sense. Call them up every couple of days or so. Ask them if they had the time to look at your application. Go into the business

- Cover letters are great too. Personalize one for each company you hand your resume to.

- Also follow up with a thank you note anytime you get an interview and/or the hiring manager takes the time to look at your application. It really leaves an impression that they will remember. Especially in entry level positions as most people will only take the time to fill out their application.

- Use job search sites, resume builders, etc. As much as possible. Even if you live in a small town like I do. Read the newspapers, talk to people, etc. You would be surprised how many more opportunities you will find by doing these things. I live in a town with a population of only 1,000 so when I applied to these sites I didn't expect much but I was actually overwhelmed by how many more applications I was filling out that I otherwise wouldn't have.

- Tell everyone that you're unemployed. This is something I didn't start doing until recently because I was embarrassed by the fact that I had been unemployed for so long but after some advice from a fellow redditor I started telling everyone that I was looking for work. Networking goes a long way. As it turned out part of the reason I got the job may have been through networking. I told a friend who told a co-worker that I was ""having troubles"" getting hired for the job. That co-worker had a son that worked in the business and that son talked to a manager for me. A kind act from someone I don't even know!

Finally

- Always have questions ready to ask the interviewer. Don't say that you don't have any questions if they ask you if you have any questions and make sure that they are good questions! My go to question was ""what are a couple of things I can do to go beyond what is required out of me?"". Have a couple ready!

- Don't wear bright colors. Even if they tell you that it's okay to wear jeans and a t-shirt make sure your t-shirt doesn't have any graphics on it and your jeans don't have any holes in them. 

- Smile and make eye contact, even if you don't have any teeth. 

- Be polite. Let the interviewer finish speaking before you say anything. Look interested in what they're saying! Nod your head, ""of course"" and ""that makes sense"" when they're explaining something to you. 

- Hands out of the pocket. Don't cross them either. Don't wear watches if you can't avoid looking down at the time every now and then. Don't even think about time. Don't fidget with pencils or pens or anything that is easy to fiddle with. Basically

- When asked why you quit your last job don't give them an overly detailed explanation. Overly explaining why you quit your last job sends the signal that you're not over it. And don't brag about your last job either! My last interview was weird in the sense that I interviewed with another person. The interview as stated before had absolutely no questions but the other person decided to keep bragging about his last job at the cheese farm. Whenever the interviewer said something he'd reply back with something like ""well, that you feel like you're too good for this company. I have no clue if that guy got the job too but I can say that the interviewer started looking annoyed after awhile by his constant bragging about his job on the cheese farm. Hell, I was annoyed by it too. Maybe that's part of the reason I got the job too despite not having to answer any questions the second time around, I looked like a better candidate simply because I wasn't bragging the whole time about my previous job. 

- Speaking of weird interviews that required me to interview with another candidate

- Don't be upset if you don't get the job. There are many reasons you probably didn't get it. Maybe the other person just had a college degree and you didn't. Just move on and keep looking. In fact

That's about all I got. I could probably give you more tips from my experiences but that's a little bit that I learned from 3 years of unemployement.

1339624096.0,v0ji3,Personal tips to help when you are not working so your life does not fall apart. Part 1,diglyd,41,8,11,"These are some personal life tips that I wanted to share that I thought might help those who find themselves out of work and looking. 

Part 1

- Get up early and start your day at 6:00 a.m.

Whether its being on the computer, making contacts or networking it is vital to start the day as early as possible and stick to this routine. Do not stay up late on Reddit, Youtube, Facebook or game until the early morning hours. Even if you have family or kids do your best to go to bed at a decent hour hopefully before midnight and wake up as early as you can while still getting enough rest. 

It is very easy to fall into a routine where you go to bed later and later. It creeps into your life and the next thing you know you are going to bed at 5:00 a.m. and waking up at 12:00 p.m. or later. If this starts to happen and becomes a habit it is almost impossible to get out of so for your sake do not get into this routine. If you are then force yourself to stay up all night and the next day then crash early and wake up as early as possible to break that cycle. Disorder and dysfunction have a tendency to pile up and create chaos in other areas of your life. 

- Clean up your place and do everything you can to keep it clean on a regular basis. I cannot stress this enough. A clean and orderly place is vital to a successful and productive state of mind. If you have a tendency to not make the bed put in effort to make sure every morning your bed is done. If you throw your clothes on the floor take the extra time every time you undress to put your clothes in your clothes hamper or wherever they can be out of sight. You are not working so there is no excuse as to why your kitchen or bathroom are not clean and why shit is all over the place. Try your best not to eat in front of the computer or have a bunch of shit scattered around your desk. Clean up all the junk and put it away. Clear your desk off everything. Leave only the bare necessities you need to either look for work or for whatever other hobby or work you do. Anything extra needs to be organized and put away. 

Waking up every morning to a clean place is an amazing and refreshing experience and goes a long way to a positive and productive state of mind. Do not think that is unimportant. 

Order is one of the most important principles to success. disorganization is like bacteria has a tendency to spread quickly and exponentially. One day everything is nice and next thing you know your place is a disaster and you are stressing and it looks like a lost cause. If you have reached this point get a maid

- Get rid of any extra shit you do not need or have not used in the last 6-8 months. Donate everything to GoodWill or some local church or other charitable organization if you can. If its a big ticket item or worth your time and money sell it on Craigslist or to someone you know. if it is old electronics find the nearest recycling center. 

Now that you are not working you have an opportunity to do some spring cleaning. Go through your closet and get rid of all the clothes you have not worn in a year or stuff you know you don't like anymore but are keeping them ""just in case"". 

Get rid of any old books that are lying around

- (*applicable if you are a gamer). If you are a gamer and if you have a large gaming collection go through it and get rid of most of that shit. Keep 10-20% of the best games you have and ditch the rest. Keep maybe 10 games. you don't need all of them. They don't have value. Games are some of the things that hold the least amount of value and its only perceived  value that you place on them that makes them worth anything.  Trade it in or better yet give it to GoodWill.  The ideal situation is to get rid of your xbox or playstation and the games or box them up so they are out of sight and out of mind. Most people do not realize how much time they give up by gaming daily on their consoles or on the computer. Giving this shit up is not easy to do. For it to work it has to be replaced with a different habit like going outside every day during those same hours that you would be gaming and doing something or writing or reading a book instead. Once you stop gaming you will realize how much more time you have to get shit done. The key is that you cannot just deprive yourself of that habit or any habit without replacing it with a better alternative or you will just go out and buy back all the same stuff you got rid off. having a replacement habit ready or a goal is vital to this case. If you love to game and have no intention of cutting yourself off completely at least consider limiting what you have to a small amount. There is no such thing as a backlog that you will eventually get to. You will never play all those games and you will never get to them. All that choice and backloggery just adds stress and paralyzes you. People go and create manageable lists of how they will beat their games instead of worrying about how to make more money or how to improve the life of their family. Its crazy and you need to take that shit under control.  

if you play MMOs either cancel your subscription or keep away form over playing and be aware of your marathon sessions. Do not stay up all night doing raids or playing all the MMOs you didn't get to before. Play responsibly and limit yourself. As noted above do not get into a habit of staying up late and not focusing on what you need to do. Do not let entertainment rule your life at this point as this is very dangerous when unemployed. 

- Refrain from ""data consumption"" on the internet. This includes sitting all day on Reddit, being on gaming forums, self help forums, why am I forever alone, and being on TMZ and reading other useless shit. Do not just consume knowledge and data all day long.  Be a person who can apply what he has learned instead of just taking in facts and figures. Time flies when you are on the Internet and its easy to loose an entire day, week and even month surfing the web and getting sucked into the interweb nether regions. Be aware of how much time you spend on the internet and for what purpose. If you can keep track of what you did when.

I dropped out of sixth form when I was 17 and haven't done a thing since. I was (and am) very depressed but feel that I'm finally ready to get my life back on track. I'm currently 20

* No education (don't even remember what GCSEs I have
* Haven't worked a day in my life.
* No marketable skills whatsoever (barely numerate).
* No formal clothing (due to a lack of funds I can't afford much -- I've got to buy a new pair of shoes today but that's pretty much the month's money gone).
* No social skills (social anxiety; I simply don't know how to talk to people).

I'm not getting any kind of help right now (no therapy/prescriptions/etc.). I live with my parents and spend all of my spare time indoors, I wasn't able to get the motivation to do so.

So, but I don't know if I have the social skills to work so closely with other people. I'm now too old to look for apprenticeships as companies get paid much less for taking on people aged 20-25, meaning they're all looking for 16-to-19-year-olds.

Here are some tips that helped me in my search and gave me bigger opportunities when looking for work. 

1 Look up temp agencys and consulting companies in your area. Make sure you get with as many as possible. DO NOT just go with one and hope they find you a job

2  Keep up with those agencies. Reach out to them every other week or once a month. This will let them know you are available and interested in work. It also keeps your name on their radar.

3 Put your resume on places like Monster and indeed. Your local network should have a place to. For example

4 Don't be terribly picky in the jobs you take. Got an offer for a 1 month admin job? Take it! You might meet people or the agency sees how hard you work for such a low level job that they may want to hire you for something else. It happened for me and I've seen it happen in business A TON!

5 Go to any sort of job or career functions you can. You'll meet people and gain connections. It doesn't have to be job related either. I went to a community thing and met someone who I can place in a role. Go there and if someone asks what you do

I did these things and I haven't been unemployed for longer than 2 months over the past 3 years. Hopefully these will help you guys too!

Whenever I got the chance (for instance when I was brought into the office room to wait for the interviewer) I would stand up with my hands at my hips like a disappointed parent about to scold their teenaged kid.

I researched the company a bit the night before and made sure I memorized the company's mission statement and 4 core values. It turned out I never got the chance to show that I knew these. I was a little more deadpan that I would have liked to be, plus the reference sheet looks so professional.

One funny thing about the process was one of three trials I had to do, the first round had me placing all but three pieces in before the time was up and the board popped. The second round I perfected the board with just a few seconds to spare.

I'm in the middle of hiring 600-800 people for event security, and how to not fall into those categories.

1. Don't mumble. Please understand that when you mumble into your phone, as this is my first impression of them, and it's a poor impression. I've had a few hundred messages that sounded like the applicant was speaking into a wet blanket from two rooms over. Speak clearly into your phone, and if you need to, write out what you want to say first. Which brings us to...

2. Keep the message short. Don't tell your potential employer your life story. I've had several people that have left messages that take 3-4 actual voicemails for them to actually give me their phone number. One that stands out was a man that left me his ENTIRE work history in 8 voicemails. He would talk until the max length of the voicemail, but that's what an interview is for. Leave your name, phone number, tell them you're interested in the position, re-state your name and phone number, then hang up.

3. Turn off your music/TV/any other noise in the background. I don't want to listen to your favorite song/TV show

4. Don't speak so fast that I can't understand you. On the opposite side of the coin from the mumbler, remember to breathe, and be sure of what you're going to say before you call.

5. If you've put in an application (especially online) and you call to confirm that the company received it (which you should), and I would be calling her the following week; she continued to call me 5-10 times a day for the next week to make sure I hadn't forgotten her. I never did forget her, but I also didn't hire her.

6. If you're having trouble reaching the company/HR person, and the last voicemail was basically them telling me how pissed they are that I haven't returned their phone calls (this was over a single day, within a 4 hour time period), and how they were going to come to my office to ""teach me a lesson in respect."" NEVER threaten a potential employer. If you need to voice concern due to how long it takes for the employer to respond to calls, do so calmly and respectfully, and everything should be fine.

7. Change your outgoing message. If you leave me a message that is clear, and when I call you back I hear something along the lines of ""ay yo, it's ya boi D. Holla if you need some. if you a hata, then you a bitch, so get out ma fone,"" I will not be leaving a message, and will probably save your number as NEVER ANSWER. Also, you'll have to leave a message"")

Issue #2: How do I explain my reason for leaving? What should I put for my reason for leaving?

I don't have a college degree nor have I ever attended college (I'm 28 years old btw). I've been working entry level jobs my whole life and I really only have 2 employers on my application. I can't afford not to put Walmart because I worked there for 2 years. It would leave an even larger gap in my employment. The second job was as a supervisor at Subway. I worked there for 4 years and I was pretty good at my job but I wonder if that's turned into a bad reference also since when I moved here I actually went back to Subway for a couple of weeks but I had so few hours that I called them up and told them I wouldn't be showing up anymore but I don't put my second time working for Subway on my application (The first time it was in a different state).

I should mention that I live in a pretty small town. There's not many jobs here and it's really competitive but I can't afford to move. So

Just very stressed about my situation and want to get working again asap.

Rewind to college. I went for Game Art &amp; Design and all was going well until I realized that I did not have the passion for art that is needed to excel and stand out from the crowd. It was a hard pill to swallow but I eventually swallowed it. 

Unfortunately this robbed me of my motivation and passion to succeed. I fluttered around in other majors until I was around 22 and then I got involved in a terrible, but I found I was good at it.

I had no real training and had to hit the ground running having only my experience building gaming pc's to back me up and thankfully I adapted to it. I held that job for a solid year until I just let my judgment become clouded and left the job. I had tons of stressors in my life

I thought I'd just go back to school and take it easy since I was still living at home. I'd take more classes and then get a better job. Turns out I just let myself get distracted and I never accomplished anything in school aside from getting a crap GPA. I had grown to hate school by this point.

Few more years go by and I can't get anything decent. Nothing that lasts over 3 months. 

I crafted a good resume with the help of various people and took it to a local CC job fair to have it critiqued by professionals and they all said that I really didn't have much I could add or do to it. This just frustrated me because I still couldn't land anything related to my field of choice. I'd get interviews that always lead to no where. Never an explanation as to why I'm turned down.

A few months ago a friend turned me on to this 'CompTIA Academy' that has recently begun at a local community college. It's basically a system of courses designed around achieving various CompTIA certifications which is a nice breathe of fresh air. I had already tried self-studying for my A+ and I just couldn't muster up the focus to get through it. I've finished my first quarter of classes and it felt great. Felt like the first real progress I've made with my life since I worked tech support.

However I don't want to wait until more classes are finished to find solid employment. I can't figure out why employers don't like me. I have had a lot of interviews at a lot of places and I never get another call back. I'm friendly, and I rehearse interview questions with my gf who does interviewing for people at her company... It just makes no sense to me and it's incredibly depressing. I almost hate submitting applications because I just don't want to be rejected AGAIN without reason. I'm even getting turned down for jobs that people on the inside recommend me for. 

I really don't care how low-end the job is

Thanks again for any help.

tl;dr - I have a good resume, am in school taking classes relevant to the field, and still cannot get anyone to take me seriously and hire me.

Fast forward to today, I did two internships (to improve experience) and was promoted at my part-time job. Is it appropriate to contact the recruiter? I have her email and phone number, is it okay if I email her and ask about any positions?


2) A company I’ve always wanted to work for has an opening.  I started applying with them immediately after I graduated in 2011. 2 years later, a very relevant promotion at work. I’ve applied online in the past before, but I never get a response.  Is it appropriate to cold call the company, ask for the recruiter and talk with them directly?

I would appreciate your feedback regarding the recommended action for the my current disposition. I hope that this discussion may help others in similar situations to overcome unforeseen realities

**The Situation:**

* 28 year old college graduate - lives at home with parents
* Out of work since July 2012
* Out of professional work since September 2011
* Unemployment benefits have been exhausted
* Student loans have entered into default due to lack of income
* Going back to school right now is an impossibility for several reasons: my current loans are in default, it will be garnished because of the loans.

The last income I had was a cash paying seasonal opportunity over the holiday season. I made $6.00/hr doing 11 hour (almost daily) shifts. I remember thinking to myself that the work I was doing made me feel like I was working in a dubious Asian factory. Most importantly, I am still sitting on a few dollars left from that endeavor but running out fast.

**Job Hunting:**

* Sent out countless online applications since September 2011
* Networking through family and friends (coworkers is not an option while unemployed)
* Cold calling
* LinkedIn
* Applied to companies directly
* Applied to recruiters
* Regular resume updates on Monster
* Visited alma matter and used their resume review services multiple times
* Had business professionals critique and edit my resumes
* Mock interviews and critiquing sessions to improve my interviewing skills
* Registering and visiting job fairs

I never get a response. I will get calls from Indian recruiters quite often

Whenever someone looks at my experience

The problem is that if I apply to a front desk position somewhere now

If I apply, they want me to have tons of experience and don't realize that I am a great fit for a technology based company. For example: I applied at AT&amp;T to be a customer sales representative. I was not hired because firstly, there were a lot of people vying for that position and secondly, because they deemed me as not as good as someone else. I am a programmer,  I think I know how the damn devices work and I am pretty sure that I can learn whatever information they throw at me during training. It doesn't take a genius to work at a cell phone store. I have experience in customer service and sales and retail. A lot of it. I waited on tables in college, I know how to work long shifts on my feet and taking orders while dealing with irate customers or customers with lots of questions. I have a college degree and I had a hard major and I did well in it. I have experience working in very prestigious corporations and being lucky enough to have very valuable experience there. What in the world do I have to do to prove to someone that I am not an idiot and that I can handle the retail sales position?

I have also had the opportunity to pull some strings through some other professionals I know into another company. My application was submitted by an insider to the HR department for this very large company. The application was rejected the next morning and I was emailed an automated response. I mean I had to guy buy this guy lunch three fucking times to get this shit going and my application gets rejected and no one even got to see the fucking application.

One of the biggest obstacles I face is that I haven't worked in so long and that has really affected my self-worth a lot and worse still, but I need to be realistic about my situation and at least explain myself.

1358818241.0,170yoc,My advice on how to get a job.  Pulled from a few sources.,Banana_Stand_Money,18,7,6,"Listen up everyone! Here's how getting a job works.

Most of you who are looking for a job are probably thinking that the best way to find a job is to look online for postings

This doesn't work. You will get lost with the rest of the world that is doing the exact same thing.
The way a company fills a job is by assessing that they have a need and that they need to hire an employee to fill that need. Think of a company as a board room of people sitting around a table. The Boss will say ""We need someone to do A
Then someone will likely say

Now
The point is networking.

Pretty much any job you are desiring right now is more likely to be obtained by you knowing someone that has an ""in"" than by filling out an application or handing out resumes.

Here is a simple way to do this. Each person's life is different in the way of how much they interact with people but it's a simple way to do it. Grab a piece of paper and write down 5 -10 companies that you want to work for. Listing them in order from most desirable to least. Do not put a company down on that list just because you have to fill a spot, neighbor, pastor, dentist, doctor, guy at the bus stop, etc. bring up the fact that you are currently looking for work. Get over the embarrassment of not having a job. Then pull that piece of paper out and show it to the person and say

Their reaction will be one of two things:


Good luck to you! Hope you find a job!

or

Actually

If it's the first one

Notice I didn't say ""That's great! Could you ask if they have any openings?"" because that gives that person a chore to do
If they say yes

This takes time

**TL;DR**You can't get a job by filling out applications and handing out resumes. It is all about who you know and networking to meet more people that could help you out.

1342554971.0,wpviz,How to respond to an insulting job offer that seems typical for my field,Navi1101,15,3,20,"So I made it to a third-round interview with a local marketing firm today. I recently quit a job with a different ""marketing"" firm that turned out to be commission-only door-to-door sales

A little background on myself: I completed an MBA in Marketing Management a year ago, I've simply been searching for jobs  with ""marketing"" as a keyword, and have mostly ended up hearing back from local marketing firms.

So far the employee promotion structures of these firms have been largely the same: sales mook for less than a month &gt; sales mook with a nicer title for 3-6 months &gt; manager still doing sales for about a month &gt; actual manager, and there doesn't seem to be much chance at making it into the big skyscrapery corporate world of my dreams. The owners of these offices are often young, and once they reach the top, there doesn't seem to be anywhere else to go other than ""bequeath everything I've built up to the next schmuck in line and start over in the big-people world.""

It's like there are two different worlds. There's the one where everything has to be done Right and job-hopping shows a lack of commitment and interview questions favor correct rather than candid answers - the one we all hear about from people who try to give up advice about applying for jobs and ""being successful"" - and then there's the world I've been interviewing in, not to live on commissions and be a salesperson and move ""up"" in some phony structure that's more about extending market reach than any kind of actual upward mobility.

In my interviews, that I'm looking for a long-term career with growth prospects, and that I'm concerned about being financially secure. Then, three interviews at this firm later, the manager I'm speaking with mentions the pay: the greater of $7.25/hr or commission at 18% of the show's sales for the day, divided up between myself and whoever else works the show or the rest of the shift. Basically, it sounds like I have a choice between making far below a living wage,"" the wording of which makes me feel like there's a chance I could get shafted on hours as well.

So far, and how little upward mobility I actually have. I feel foolish being one of those people who's ""holding out for a management job,"" especially in this economy, but, well, dammit I have a masters degree. Don't I qualify for better?

My questions, or do I have better options? Are there no other low-experience marketing jobs available just by the nature of the industry, or have I been applying at the wrong places? Was my education all a waste, and do I need to endure a job that a trained monkey could do (and would get paid better for) before I really qualify for something better? Should I take this job just to hold me over until I find something better? If I do take this job just to tide me over, how much will the appearance of job-hopping actually hurt me in looking for a ""real"" job?

I am a Comp Sci major in the south texas area who graduated back in May with my Bachelors. Throughout my college career I had worked in IT as a desktop technician for the university and a computer technician for an entire department. My GPA is an amazing 2.79 and I have sacrificed the majority of my social time for learning about servers, C#, Bash


I have gone to the career placement on campus and had them review my resume plus help me create a cover letter. I've had experience with interviews since that's how I received my jobs but I asked them tips and so on.


Alright now this past March a company I applied for contacted me and since it was based in San Antonio I couldn't just drive over for an interview so a phone interview was set up. The job I was applying for was Linux Administrator I and I thought I met the qualifications. The initial interview went well because they passed me on to the next interview. The next interview involved me logging into a server and perform various fixes within a set amount of time. For whatever reason I blanked out and struggled the entire time. The next day there was another phone interview and I was asked more questions and I forgot to study DNS on Linux, LinkedIn, WorkInTexas, contacts I've made in college, and WorkForce. The only jobs that show up is Senior level positions with at least 10+ years experience which is way beyond me currently. I also even tried BestBuy unsuccessfully.
Although my preference job wise would be a Linux Admin I can also do programming and I have posted a couple of my projects on GitHub. The main company I am interested in getting into is Rackspace and that was the job I interviewed with back in March.


Now the questions.


* Should I bother keep trying with Rackspace?


* Is this normal for a guy with my qualifications to be unemployed for this amount of time?


* Is there anything else I can do besides volunteer/program more that'll make me more potent of a candidate?

And they emailed back! Yippee! They were very understanding. They expressed an interest in having me in for an interview. It sounds like a few people are competing for this job, so far.

We got to the point where they asked me my rate. I haven't done this before, let's be honest and help them guide me through it. This might not work some places, but I felt comfortable asking questions because they had been very willing to listen despite me not meeting their preferred 3-5 years experience. So I just said, ""I'm not sure on the rate. I made x at my last position, is there any way you could match that?"" and left it at that. My field (computer programming) has a very wide pay scale, and I don't know where this position is on the scale.

So being the idiot I was



The temp agency never told me when I officially started. This went on for 3 weeks. I would wait for a call and would get nothing. Not a word in my inbox. Every time I called (**yes I would call them** every other day, I was running out of savings to pay for my monthly student loan bills (keep in mind I live with my mother so I don't pay rent, just the loan statements which have already been consolidated as much as possible).



Just then a bit of motivation and a spark comes my way to walk into a restaurant hiring downtown and apply. I wasn't sure if I would get the job, I got the job and I start on Tuesday. The one drawback is that the job is only part time and I would more than likely get 25 hours a week. I'm trying to come up with a plan to move out eventually (while I'm still making payments on my student loans). So far my idea is to see how this job goes until I get used to it and hunt for a second part time job.

**EMPLOYMENT BACKGROUND**:  I've worked pretty consistently from 2004 - the beginning of this year in the legal field (staff, but I quit working at the end of Jan. 2012 so I could focus on school full time.  Now my class load is light enough to where I can balance work &amp; school better.   

**PROBLEM**:  My last job was pretty much an administrative gig.  That's cool but I don't do well with certain important aspects of the job.  I guess you can say I'm not good at taking care of other people's arrangements and I'm not comfortable working through the phone.  I'm not great at making travel arrangements or handling a ""switchboard"" for example.  I feel more comfortable working waaay behind the scenes.  

My first job involved scanning documents to be loaded into databases to eventually database management (didn't need to know how to use Access or SQL) and I felt like I excelled and thrived.  I didn't have to talk a lot aside from troubleshooting

Right now I'm just looking for a temporary gig and can do the admin stuff on a temporary basis with no problem

**QUESTION**:  What are some job options that I can work towards that require little of the admin work that I didn't do well in

**Educational BKGD just in case

* Majored in psychology and East Asian studies (focus on Japan), 1 semester of Intro Bio, 2 semesters of human anatomy &amp; physiology, 1 semester of Microbiology, 1 semester of Nutrition, 1 semester of Stats, and I'm finishing up the 2nd semester of Calculus.  There's an intro to computing course in there somewhere

* I am currently doing the Intro to Comp Sci course through Udacity.  Thankfully for me the course uses Python

* I've also tried my hand at learning MySQL + PHP through books and an online CEU course offered through the local community college.  I passed and got a certificate of completion.  

* I am seriously considering getting an MS Office Excel certification just b/c my limited knowledge of Excel has saved my butt in my admin job and made me invaluable to some of my co-workers.  A friend suggested doing Sharepoint as well.

* Also familiar with VERY basic HTML stuff.  I usually don't bring this up but like my Excel skills this actually proved extremely useful in my admin job as I had to take on some blog publishing duties for some attorneys.  Again it was a matter of not many people knowing how to use it rather than me being some kind of wizard.

I see people my age or younger doing what I would like to do. I always want to ask how they got that job. I don't want to get them in trouble though.

I have a few reasons I want to move away from general labor jobs. 

My son will be born in a few months. I want to get home and not be so tired that I won't want to play with him. 

I have a feeling that moving up in a entry level white collar job is faster than moving up in a entry level blue collar job. 

Less risk of getting hurt on the job. 

Also I have noticed that people working white collar jobs are happier. 

So will I be able to find a white collar entry level job? ",self,t5_2uagc,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/15gdns/will_staffing_agencies_find_me_a_white_collar_job/

I started working at 14. Due to (then undiagnosed) anxiety disorders, Restaurant, Hotel, Lottery, and self-employment doing odd jobs like HTML web design, house cleaning, and 'art'). I believe the longest I ever spent in one job was 6 months and I have poor/no records of where I worked and when.
At 19 I had a bad mental breakdown that left me barely able to communicate properly, daughter was born and because of health complications I have yet to really return to the workforce.
I have Grade 12 and a number of training certificates but no work (or volunteer) experience that I can put on a resume.

My father has been out of a job for almost 6 years now.  Sure he's had a few temporary ones here and there

Earlier, talking to other people, trying to find opportunities everywhere he looked.  Keep in mind however, that my dad is reaching 60 years old, his only degree is a Bachelor's in business, and he worked the same dead-end job since he was 17 until he was laid off in his 50s.  

Yet as the days went on, not physically, but verbally. He berates her for working overtime, and talking about her job; claiming that she cares more about her work than her family (He is very old-fashioned and conservative) but I know he's really yelling at himself, trying to bring us down to his level.

Now he spends all day on the computer playing solitaire, he doesn't even talk about getting a new job. 

My oldest sister, the youngest being only about a month old.  He has completely submerged himself into becoming what I call ""a full time nanny"" for these kids.  Of course I know the importance of a grandfather spending time with his grandkids, but I never see the man anymore.  Every night when I come home, my mom is either at work or sleeping, and my dad is at my sister's house taking care of his grandchildren, or fixing up my sister's house, buying my niece and nephew new toys, etc.

His grandchildren make him happy, but in reality he's hurting so many people while doing so.

My mom is working three jobs now to pay the bills, when in reality he's the opposite, but he never stopped making excuses for himself.

I know the thought process, and do something that brings us comfort.  No one wants to focus on things that make them feel bad or stress them out.  I frequently get anxiety attacks when I think about my future.  I'll tell myself, ""Oh just go out with your friends tonight, think about your career tomorrow, you'll feel better"", and the next day it repeats.

It's a vicious cycle that repeats because of our inability to stop making excuses for ourselves.  Don't become like my father

It may seem like you're the only victim of your unemployment, are you completely devoted to finding a new job?  Or are you honestly just pushing it off and making excuses.  I've been through this process in trying to find a job as well, I also have a part-time so my situation isn't dire, but it still is a problem.

The interview went really well, so I declined the other position.   (the reason for this was that they left the room to discuss my interview, came back and then showed me the building and let me follow another employee at the company for a while, and said things like they would be excited to have me- but no firm, ""We are offering you a job"" statements, probably because background check needed to be completed.)

Well, but then I got an email (from an outside company) asking me for more information on my background check.  So, I filled that out the same day, but I'm sure they wouldn't have gotten to it until Friday.  I don't know how long background checks take, and I know training hasn't started yet (they said early to mid September).  

I called their HR number today and it has been changed- their message directs you to the company's main number.  The only option that worked for a potential employee lands you at a Helpdesk answering machine, but wanted to verify before I used it. 

I know I did lots of things wrong (not following up sooner

Wednesday

To Online Learning at X Community College:

I am very happy to hear about your opening for an Online Learning Multimedia Activities and Educational Games Specialist. I heard about the position through X, and is dedicated to finding the best solution possible, I am the right person for this position.

* _Outstanding technical competency_. I took two semesters at X X University in game development and design, Blender, and Thingiverse, a collection of reusable 3D models. I spent 6 months at X, a premier software development firm in X. With the innovative X Laptop Orchestra, I used an array of creative muscial tools. Proficient in game and multimedia technolgies and always willing to learn, I am a great selection for technical mastery.

* _Knowing the student perspective._ During the 2012-13 school year, Blackboard, and everyone's favorite: buying textbooks. I attended X University, receiving my Bachelor's in Computer Science in 2012. Studying in higher education for the past five years, I am intimately familiar with the challenges of student life. 

* _Dedicated to finding the best solution possible._ At X, crucial mantras were “the simplest thing that could work,” “let's run the experiment,” and “what's right for the user?” Throughout my academic and professional career, I dedicated myself to finding the best solution possible. 

I eagerly anticipate your response about the opening for the Online Learning Multimedia Activities and Educational Games Specialist. I would love to come in for a meeting and talk about the vision for online learning at XCC.

Sincerely

John Doe

For the last year, to be honest, I really miss being part of a larger organization and having coworkers.  

I'd like to get some advice on finding the best way to present this to potential employers.

My previous work experience has all been centered on higher education:  TA, that also managed studios, supervised 10-15 employees, oversaw a large library of photo/video/audio gear, print studio.  I'm Wordpress and other CMS savvy but am not a web designer by any means.  I have pre-press skills from running my press, but don't have the years of commercial printing experience that seem prerequisite to getting hired in the printing industry.  I'd love to get into digital asset/media management and archiving but even the entry level positions now require at least a master's degree in library sciences.

1348234487.0,108wif,Any tips/hope for getting a job in the US as foreigner?,Mirodir,7,0,3,"In the last 3 years (starting August 2009) I was part of a chemical-company here in Switzerland/Europe. I was absolving a job-training/apprenticeship to become a chemical lab technician

Since it's been my wish to work in a foreign country for as long as I can think I would really love to work in the USA for at least a bunch of years; wouldn't mind staying there my whole life.
 
I will give you a quick overview on my education in the last paragraph and a deeper explanation in the following paragraphs.

Our school-system works different than in the US. After I finished my obligatory school I started a job-training in Switzerland. It's usual here that even more complex-jobs like the one I got trained and certificated for (chemical lab technician in agricultural formulation development) are taught in a job-training you can apply for without having studied at a college. You visit a special school 2 days a week and work for your company the other 3 days. During your time in school you learn important stuff regarding the type of job you’re getting trained for and acquire a deep knowledge in those things. At work you learn to apply your gained knowledge while working for the company.

The Subjects you have during your school-days (for a chemical-lab job) are:

* 3 years of Chemistry

* 3 years of Applied Math

* 2 years of Applied Physics

* 2 years of English

* 1 year of Biology


Besides the job-training you're able to study for a professional baccalaureate in a topic related to the field you're studying in. I studied for a professional baccalaureate in the technical-field

* 3 years of Math

* 3 years of German (because I live in the German speaking part of Switzerland)

* 1 year of Physics

* 1.5 years of Chemistry (less than during the ""normal"" apprenticeship though)

* 2 years of English

* 1 year of English for the Cambridge-FCE

* 1 year of French

* 1 year of History

* 1 year of Economics

* An interdisciplinary project.


At work I have first visited a basic lab course for half a year. Teaching how to behave in a lab and basic synthesizes and analytical methods. After this time I worked in several different teams, herbicides, etc.). Sometimes I visited courses for a few weeks, teaching more basic methods in the lab, extending what I’ve learned in the first half year. I also had two short stages in other chemical fields. Working 2 months in analytical and 2 months in synthetical process-development.
Other than working together with my job-trainers I had some projects I could work on on my own with my job-trainer as supervisor. Once I was responsible for showing our formulation-testing methods to a co-worker from Singapore (all in English).


In addition to all this I achieved a grade A in the Cambridge First Certificate in English which is


**Quick overview:**
I finished a 3-year apprenticeship in an agrochemical-company to become a federally certificated chemical lab technician

1348184065.0,107xkf,What to tell me in an actual F2F interview about reasons for leaving former job? Sales and commission related.,Sorge74,7,0,4,"Here's my story and thank you for anyone who reads and replies.

I was a senior store manager for a smaller wireless company. It was great and exciting. I had finished my degree but the job was fun and paid very well compared to stress level. Was making a base of 7.30 an hour (lol) with manager bonus of 350 a month
That changed to a base of 10.15 an hour

So I got a job in retail banking as a part personal banker part teller. Base is 12 and I could in theory get up to a grand in commission. My problem is I was responsible for 25% of the sales and manager was responsible for 75%, and so I'm not making commission and I'm worried for my career. Customers in store come first, even if its just everyday teller stuff, so I can't do calls. I'm very concerned about being let go, or at least never promoted regardless of my effort level. I really give 110%, but I can't do sales when I'm being a teller since we are short handed. I can barely do the work required as I get more resposoblilty due to high turn over. Had to leave people at my desk for 15 minutes to do something with our ATM that's on a time table and was running out of time. A job responsibility I frankly shouldn't have.

So I've been looking and I want to know how to best explain why I am seeking a different job. I love sales and the idea of my job

I also don't know how to raise my concerns, since I love the career path I could have, but like I said I feel set up for failure. 

I know given my past and the level of effort I give I'm worth having and worth promoting. I've had large amount of success but I can do 100% of sales while doing the same amount of teller transactions as a full time teller and yes they track transactions and I'm 10% below our full timer

If I chose the part time situation, but it has created problems in the past on salary, so I imagine hourly would be even more dramatic. I also commute by bike an hour each way.

Given all the hats of a small company, invoicing etc so I have a pretty holistic view of the finances. There's some strategy problems, so I'm not sure if the company can/will bounce back.

So ultimately I'm not sure which option I should really choose. I've never been on unemployment. I have a decent amount of savings. Only debt is some student loans. I'm a bit quirky

When I first applied, well, I guess if I hear back from them I will let them know and give them an updated copy, which is what I did once I heard back. 

I emailed the recruiter and told her that I accidentally attached the wrong resume and to use the updated one (my GPA was not listed on my new resume since it had fallen below a 3.5 during my senior year). She said thanks and we set up the interview. I went to the interview and to my surprise, and the interviews went great.

I need some advice about starting my professional career. Here is a little background info on me: I have lived in 7 countries and traveled to about 20 others in my whole life. I am 25 years old, German and I decided it was time to complete my bachelor's so I could make some more serious money. I will graduate with a Bachelor in Business Administration in Canada but I am not satisfied with the prospects. As a side note, I am born in Western Europe and all my family is from and still lives there. As a result, I have nobody who could help me land me a job or an interview through relations. I have to fend for myself.

1. 
I have no idea which position I want to occupy. It seems that when applying for a job you should have a very precise idea of the position you are looking for. I'm afraid I'm rather more like “let me see what you have to offer and if something appeals to me”. Unfortunately

2.
I have a big issue working for companies that contribute to making the world a worst place than it is and screwing people/the planet over (banks, these companies are the largest employers of people with a degree like mine AFAIK. Where should I look for more ethical and sustainable companies who are profitable and will still be able to give me a decent wage? I hope decent pay and ethical business practice isn't as mutually exclusive as it seems?

3.
I have traveled around the world for 3 years, entry level and available almost anywhere on the planet. Is that an asset for me or will it be seen as being flaky and a low achiever by a potential employer?

4. I would love (at least for the first 5 or 10 years of my career) to work as an expat. Is that reasonable to hope being an expat at the beginning of my career or is it more of a “reward” for senior employees?

5. I would like to see what kind of job I could land myself in NYC or SF. Again

My understanding is that the HR department reviews all resumes and cover letters, then selects a reason from a drop-down menu and this is what you see when you sign in. There is no additional information given. 

Would it be tactless to send a message to the human resources department asking them to either reconsider or for a more thorough explanation? I could see getting knocked out after an interview or something

Edit: for clarification

What I need from you all is a fresh look at how to package my story into a coherent


**The Basics**

-BS in applied math (think computer modeling

-8 months ""real"" job experience working in the field doing energy efficiency inspections and (very basic) models for houses. I quit to move. I spent time in people's houses crawling around in their attics and probing their heating systems

-A few months very part time (10 hours/week) doing very cool

-The rest of the time has been spent working in bike shops. So I'm pretty good at fixing bikes. 

**The Problem**

I can't seem to find the sweet spot for what sorts of jobs to apply to and how to market myself. For technical ""analyst"" type positions my couple of semesters of programming classes don't make the cut

I really liked my internship, but at this point I just want to get on track to build up the skills and connections to do that. 

So, but finding the concise, powerful way to present this stuff is the whole problem!

I'll keep things as short as possible. I worked for my former employer for 4 years; Jan 2008 - Dec 2011. I have never had a written warning, even using the excuse ""You didn't get the promotion because you left your wife."" one time. Their main way of getting rid of people now is to target the longest employed employees and harass them until they quit to save the company money and having to pay unemployment/severance. This is what happened to me.


 The HR lady kept messing with my punches on the time card to appear as time fraud but I wouldn't approve the punches, life in general etc. He gave me some paperwork that allowed me to quit and still get unemployment.

My employer and the people there who harassed me were furious that I was able to get unemployment. The HR lady called government services several times trying to get my unemployment revoked but they basically told her ""He's got tons of medical paperwork

Basically I haven't worked since Dec 2011. I started college last year as a full time student and I did miss a gap of a couple of months when my mom passed away last year. It was a tough time for me dealing with that. I've remade my resume countless times. I've taken a resume course and got a perfect grade and was told my new resume is awesome. I've been pounding the pavement and applying online daily with no callbacks. I feel like maybe potential new employers are calling my former employer and that's why they are not hiring me. I could leave it off my resume but it would then appear that my last year of working was 2008.

What should I do in this situation? I'm a full-time college student and I need a part time job to help out. It's putting tremendous pressure on my relationship and life in general.

I have already encountered two scam attempts in the few weeks I have been responding to ads on craigslist. Yes, so I figured I might have similar success looking for jobs.

**Scam 1:** I advertised myself on craigslist as a tutor. Someone responded, this was a mistake on my part.

A few emails later, this message came.

&gt; From hereweride Beau weridehere@gmail.com

&gt;I was just notified that the total amount of   $2480

Note

&gt;Now that the check has been mailed to you, you are to deduct $480 which is lesson fee plus $50 for your running around, then help me to send $1,600 to the landlord of the apartment where we will be staying when we arrive via MONEY GRAM ,  as I have already made reservation for that. The remaining amount will be collected from you when we meet Here is the information of the  landlord below:

 
&gt;LANDLORD  INFORMATION

&gt;Name:  Jill Roby

&gt;Address:  865 S Douglas

&gt;Springfield
 
&gt; I believe I can count on you and that is why I am comfortable by letting you handle this money transfer for me
Thanks And Stay Bless

Problem: You deal face-to-face on craigslist. You do not deal in MoneyGram, or anything like that. This is stated clearly in the Help section of craigslist. edit: http://www.craigslist.org/about/scams

Problem: This is the Nigerian prince scam. Not necessarily Nigerian; they could be American, Indian, Nigerian, or something else. Not necessarily princes; they could just be jerk-offs.

I did not respond. I just marked the message as phishing in Gmail. Hopefully my one little data point will help Google become better at detecting phishing attempts.

&gt;Thanks

&gt;Shop670

**Scam 2:** Not technically a scam, which is a little above $10/hr for 40 hours. Sounded like my kind of gig.

Problem: There was no job description in the post.

Problem: There was no company name in the post. (blah blah confidential

I went in to their local office. Very convenient, in my opinion. I do not want to trick my way into people's homes and try to scam them on an overpriced vacuum ""system."" If you doubt that Kirby is a scam, search reddit for stories about being a vacuum salesman. Very informative, actually.

I am really desperate for some help. I apologise in advance for the Rant below.

I really need to find work, I have had work in the last 6.5 years. But only about 3 months (if that) was anything related to my degree.

I am now currently unemployed and claiming benefits.

I'm a 30 year old male from the UK

I send out CVs and try and make contacts all the time

The most soul shattering experience for me this year was when I was contacted by a very enthusiastic woman saying there was a 5 month contract and they wanted to use me. I was invited to attend a meeting later that week only to receive an e-mail from her telling me that they had a change of plan and wanted to wait. They would be in contact later in a couple of weeks. 

To say I never heard from her again would be a lie. I e-mailed her 2 weeks later to follow up. I got a call from from someone with in the company working on another show offering me 1 days work. I sent the original lady a ""thank you"" e-mail

The rest of the summer was the same story with several other companies and no more work. 

I have been supporting myself doing odd jobs here and there for small amounts of money. I have been receiving a good response from local businesses about my photography. However

I just don't know what to do anymore. I don't really know what my qualifications and experience can do for me. I feel like I'm at the bottom of the barrel. I feel sick (and I mean physically sick) and tired of keep on trying and not getting anywhere.

I grew up in a small mid-western town, I did OK.  Looking back, I never really knew what I was doing in college, I was just there because I felt it was expected of me.  I never really had a direction, which lead to the degree.  At some point I learned about a degree called ""Individual Studies"".  Basically, this degree was dolled out after completing general education classes, and then a specific number of upper level classes, after 5 years

I wasn't really sure what to do with my degree, and for the most part enjoyed the work and learned a lot.

After that year was up, but my heart was not in my location.  I moved about an hour north, in with my GF, to another town that had a state university.

I started subbing again, and did very well, keeping a near 4.0GPA.  I also picked up a job at Borders during the following holidays to have a little more money in my pocket.  Sometime the next spring I took a job bar-tending at a small blue collar tavern.  At first, it was great, high paced, meeting lots of people, and felt appreciated.  But there was a dark side, he regularly stole from the business and more or less just did what he wanted.  I slowly quit substituting and attending master level classes.  I was there for 6 yrs

About 3 1/2 years ago, I was the only one there and also running an attached liquor store.  The only restrooms were the same ones that the customers used.  Each restroom was a small room with a sink and toilet (mens had a urinal), no partitions, and no locks on the door.  I usually worked 9hr shifts, with little time for a bathroom break, let alone a #2 emergency.  My IBS symptoms kind of creeped up out of no where, and I started having incidents where I had to crap immediately, but a nightmare at work.  I started seeing a GI doctor, still had troubles

I should quickly note, dog sat, and dog training.  Luckily I had had a fairly sizable savings that has allowed me to basically live un-employed the last 3 years (No state assistance).

Now we come to about 14 months ago, which is helping to build my confidence.  I also hang around /r/Fitness and attempting to get phsyically healthier.  /r/stopsmoking gave me the initiative to put down my filthy habit, and have now been cigarette free for 128 days.  I have been lurking around /r/anxiety lately, and it is helping to me understand that I'm not the only one having the feelings I do.  It also gave me the courage to finally go see a therapist last week.

That brings me to now, don't even know where to start.  How do I handle being unemployed for the last 3 years?  I'm really worried that I am only qualified for manual labor or retail, and that I don't really have any marketable skills.  Any help, suggestions, advice will be greatly appreciated.  Also, any other subs I should cross-post.

While taking classes, there's virtually no chance I'll ever get moved up to 40 hours a week. I'm relatively comfortable at the moment because I live with family, I have all my bills covered with a little extra to spend, but there's no room to really start saving and I'm eager to do more.

I'm not really sure where to begin

Here's some more specific details:

Associate's in Computer Networking.  

No certifications yet

In addition to my Networking degree I have some skill in Access(took a class at the college) and I've signed up to take online courses in PHP

I have close to 2 years experience now as a Web Developer at the college

The independent work I did with him has made me fall in love with the thought of doing freelance work. I've had that in mind when signing up for the PHP/CSS3/HTML5 intro and intermediate courses this summer but I don't know how reliable that is. I know I can do editing/upkeep but I'm unsure how strong or weak I am in design.

My career in IT is a solid 15 years, etc.

A couple years ago, as I would get a cut of profits which, at the time, were significant.

The market they are in shifted and they were not properly diversified in revenue streams. As a result the company appears to be sliding.

About 6 weeks ago I started looking for a new job. I have been looking in my traditional roles, the only reason I didn't get the job was that it was a remote position and they re-scoped the role to be local prior to any offers being made.

I am not opposed to continuing in management, although so far it hasn't been mentioned. Also, there's really no comparable role in most companies.

The question is how to best deal with the situation?

Or is it just a matter of time before I can find someone willing to overlook this?

1376798334.0,1kl771,Question regarding piercings and an INTERNAL interview,misskitty5077,1,0,1,"My employer is doing internal interviews for about a dozen positions right now. 

The people who are conducting the interviews all know I have tattoos and piercings. The tattoos  are easily hidden by normal clothing as are all piercings except ear lobes and a very simple nostril piercing where I have a plain ring. Our dress code is business casual except I work overnights (and the positions are also overnight) so it's even more relaxed.

 For example, I kick the flip flops off and run around barefoot. Other coworkers also run around barefoot so that is not an issue. During the winter I run around in my socks. When I started there was one girl there who had two full sleeve tattoos who always wore short sleeves. She is no longer there as she was just picking up shifts on a temporary basis. My immediate supervisors wear jeans, their sup does the same and his director does, too. 

I do not have any face-to-face contact with our clients as all interactions are by phone

The company is laid back to the point that they served wine during our Christmas event DURING the work day and margaritas and tequila for Cinco de Mayo. 

I only ask this because I recently had this piercing done for the third time and I don't want to lose it again. I lost it once for a surgical procedure when it was several months old and I had to remove it so I know I will lose it again. I don't think that a simple diamond would make much of a difference compared to the hoop during the interview process.

1376423156.0,1karyj,How can you start building a network?,rednail64,1,2,0,"I've answered this question a few times here in the last week

First

In my industry (wine &amp; spirits), but networking is so much more effective.

So how can you start building a network if you don't have one

1.  **Start with who you know.**  your IRL network.  This would include friends, clergy, doctor and dentists, etc.  Basically anyone with a number of friends and colleagues or that are gainfully employed.  [Here's a place to start if you aren't sure how to do it](http://www.jobbankusa.com/CareerArticles/Networking/Developing_A_Networking_Contact_List.html)

2.  **Join LinkedIn groups.**  Don't just sit there and wait for people to invite you in - go find them.  Start with groups.  You can join up to 50, active memberships.

3.  **Use Advanced Search on LinkedIn.**  Using the Advanced Search screen, etc.) and invite them to connect.  If you can't invite them directly, use the Get Introduced feature.  [Here's how to do it if you're unsure](http://help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1959)

4.  **Expand your professional circle.** Look for a leadership role in a local charity or civic group. If you're unemployed

5.  **Get out of the house!**  Your absolutel best chance to get hired is by hanging around with people who already work where you want to work.  Are there any conventiions nearby?  Sign up to be a volunteer.  Typically if you work for a day handing out brochures or something they'll credential you for the rest of the convention.  Are there meetups going on?  Are there big offices?  If so

6.  **Have the right tools for the job.**  Handing your contacts a resume is not effective

I started work when i was 16 as a lifeguard and then worked various food service jobs until I was 20. During this time I also attended school to become a certified medical assistant and acquired 33 credits before running out of money. (I paid for school myself at a community college)

When I was 20 I was hired by a steel company as a helper and member of the 612 iron workers union. Within a week I had demonstrated my ability to learn new things and was put in the apprenticeship program to be a fitter. I left this job when I was 22 after 30 months.
Also during that time I played in a band which managed to record about 3 albums and engage on a handful of small tours. As I stopped playing in a band I started learning Mixed martial arts at a local gym which I will explain why it is important later.

When I was 22 I started work for New York state in a rehabilitation center for developmentally disabled individuals with forensic issues. (pedophilia, rape ect). I have worked for over 5 years at this job, writing legal observations of patients treatments and progress. I am also responsible for administering medication and for months of future medicine. I routinely have had to talk down individuals with weapons and engage in physical interventions when violent situations arise.

I also have been working part time as an instructor at the mixed martial arts gym. After 3 years and a few fights I reached my coaching rank and was hired as an instructor. I am responsible for planning lessons

I can't go to college due to various reasons. I don't really feel like getting into that right now. I've done a lot of research on it. Just take it to be not an option for this.

I am interested in the areas of marketing, but it worked out that I did more technical things and not as much of the marketing, development, business growth, etc. that I intended. I have done some of all of that, but the business is only 2 years old and I don't think that's a lot of experience, or enough to find a job in those fields. I also do not have any formal training/education in those areas (I am planning to do this but need to get some sort of job/income first). What kind of job do you think I could get

I'm 24

* organising and managing projects
* effectively finding creative solutions within rigorously structured work
* applying existing technical skills effectively
* how to brilliantly communicate both within a team and to external personnel
* relying on myself and rapidly teaching myself the necessary skills to complete all kinds of different jobs
* how much sleep I could actually go without.

I regret it. Although I know the course did those things for me

For the last twenty months

* troubleshooted all the hardware in the office inc. printer/scanners
* solved basic IT issues for our team
* organised with external departments personnel hiring/leaving and filled in the forms for the Office Manager to sign
* organised personnel travel
* co-ordinated two office moves
* bought furniture and stationery for the office
* kept track of project progress and produced reports for external management
* regularly checked the office was up to HSE standard and trained as the office's fire warden
* typed the Office Manager's emails and reports.

The O.M. was in his mid-sixties, but I was still challenged from every angle. That sounds real bullshitty, but it's completely true.

Why did I leave? Well

Before that job, each gin has its own nuances and I feel steak goes best with *dry* stouts that aren't too hopped).

What do I want to do with my life? I'll be honest

**Those things don't pay the next bill that comes through the door.** Not yet

My predicament is that I feel I have plenty of great personal skills, one bar management position and twenty months of office management and admin and IT support, without being an office manager. I feel lost.

Where do I go from here

First, ovens, stovetops, boiling water, knives, and essentially non-stop multitasking.

My trainer was an experienced baker (5 years). Normally, and that my presence would be an increased risk to the operation.

My mind state was foggy and my awareness would cut in and out. By the time I got to work, get better sleep during the daytime, between shifts). I did not drink coffee because, if it was caffeine withdrawal, there was a good chance that coffee would have an inverse effect and incapacitate me completely. When my trainer ended up being 30 minutes late, I started what I could recall from the bake procedure I learned the night before, and asked the storefront staff to make me a medium black coffee

Of course, both in terms of food safety and work safety. I would also certainly be incompetent as a trainee, having both my working memory and retention compromised significantly.

When my trainer showed up, based on my very erratic performance, even though I was already dreading the personal repercussions, and extremely disappointed (irrationally so given my mindstate) that I couldn't come up with more creative solution. (The one thing that calmed me down was how ''Carry on My Wayward Son'' spanned the short drive home, playing on the radio in the car that my dad was driving, who displayed obvious contempt at my decision.)
