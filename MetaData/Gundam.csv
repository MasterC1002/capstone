There's a couple of small simultaneous gundam issues happening.  There's a push for the Origin novel as well as a twitter movement called #bringbackgundam

I'm here for comments and to help put focus on what it is this is movement is about.  I'm not putting this into /gunpla/ because the products we bring into the u.s. are not just model kits.

I'm here because I'm confused about what gundam fans want.  It's like Occupy Wall Street right: a phrase and no cohesiveness.  And if I'm confused

EDIT 1: Initial comments indicate #bringbackgundam is relatively unknown and isolated only to twitter to have gundam on toonami; Gundam the Origin pushes are actually a separate topic that's happening concurrently; by the terms ""gundam back in stores"" actually mean toysrus, though that's not likely to be possible",,False,,t5_2sjr4,1354905109.0,,

As some of you may have noticed over the past few months I've posted here and there about the upcoming release of *Gundam: The Origin* from Vertical. We're talking about a high quality, release. Each volume gets one print, then it's done! As of right now [Volume 1](http://www.amazon.com/Mobile-Suit-Gundam-ORIGIN-Activation/dp/193565487X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1354580243&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=gundam+origin) and [Volume 2](http://www.amazon.com/Mobile-Suit-Gundam-ORIGIN-Garma/dp/1935654888/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1354580243&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=gundam+origin) are up for preorder on Amazon (check with your fav provider if you don't hang with Amazon). Volume 3 will probably show up in the next couple weeks.


Now, and will probably be the last big thing. As far as I can tell The Origin never got a full release here states so on its own it's going to be one hell of a collectable, never mind the added appeal for anime and Gundam fans alike.


Today Vertical tweeted about their current order for the first volume...

&gt; [@Vertical_Ed](https://twitter.com/Vertical_Ed/status/275690068440649728) Gundam ORIGIN news: If those estimates hold looks like the print run will be either 4000 to 4500. 


To which I responded...


&gt; [@Falldog](https://twitter.com/Falldog/status/275742191635267584) Is that good


And their response troubles me...


&gt; [@Vertical_Ed](https://twitter.com/Falldog/status/275742191635267584) it's fine. but as I noted to another person,000. Gundam ORIGIN only 4000. 


*Ouch!* Some manga about a cat is currently out doing Gundam three-to-one! But the point about Bandai is a tough one to stomach. Is Bandai really right to have stepped out of the market in a lot of ways?


Am I wrong in thinking that we should all want one of these? With over subscribers to subreddit we can't possibly represent roughly 50% of the Gundam fanbase


**Edit** - You guys have made some great points about the marketing and Amazon listing. I'm going to put some of this stuff together and send it with some other ideas to the Vertical guys.

I know what you're thinking 

""make our own Gundam series?! that's crazy we'd never be able to do that""

We can do it though

Now I'm an artist, that'd actually be helpful, but I just want to say; I'm not a writer, that's where you guys come in:

What I suggest we do is we either come up with characters or we come up with the story first, now I'm not going to hog being the artist, everyone else is welcome to draw instead of me infact you'd be welcome to do it, this is a collaboration and anything you bring to the table will be appreciated immensely.

***

**LIST OF THINGS TO DO**

- Name ourselves

- Design and discuss characters and universe and Mobile Suits.

(Create series Zaku 2, own version of newtype? like x-rounder or innovade, create initial gundam, create half way series upgrade, End of series Mobile Armour that protagonist has to battle)


- Construct Story line and plot points around the attributes listed in previous task

- Write Script

- Do reference sketches and concept art 

- do Story boarding for first Volume 

- Finish Vol 1 release to Newgrounds and other places

- Begin Vol 2 repeat until series finish

If I've missed anything then it'll be added.

**TL;DR -  We're Making our own Gundam Series in our own Universe, I'm an artist and so can you, List of shit we need to do, side notes.**

If you've been trying to play

1 - the game doesn't launch from the launcher

2 - the game is IP blocked, you're stuck trying to log in over and over.

1348999218.0,10pfa8,So AGE was set up to fail [possible spoilers],ArsAeria,29,4,33,"Okay

There was an interview recently done interviewing Bandai about what happened with Gundam AGE. The following was translated by an anon:

-Hino is a new type of person that has never been involved with Gundam before

-When one wants to make enemies show up inside a colony

-What he thinks is important is the timing of the enemies showing up: He has a tendency to think of a story as a sequence of in-game events.

**-The staff working on the show had to take Hino's ideas and add the missing logic to them.**

-They purposely left holes in the setting so that the fans would bite

-At first they did not find the bad response to Age especially surprising

-However

-With other series, the negative things overwhelmed them drastically.

-Even so the staff tried their best to make the show interesting.

-They started to get confidence around the time HG AGE-2 went on sale. Sales also stabilized around this point.

-They found it interesting how many users played around modifying Age kits (more than usual).

-One of Age's unique qualities was being able to see a lot of modded kits while the show was airing.

-He has participated in other Gundam series and knew from the beginning that the Vegan designs would be unpopular with Gun-ota

-The Vegan designs were order-made

-He remembered how unpopular Zanscar's designs were and himself wondered if it would be a good idea to go with these

------

Behind the scenes, AGE was designed to be a video game, but panned out into a series. Early on, when the series was met with critics (which was a HUGE shock to the development team), Hino's response to the fans was: **""*We didn't make a perfunctory approach to understand the concept of Gundam.* We are producing Gundam AGE in a different way from any other Gundam series. Our policy for the new gundam will be explained in the anime.""**

Basically...Hino didn't have any clue how to create a Gundam series in the first place

Then when none of the other writers or people on the team could figure out where the hell he was going with things...he figured

This is amazing to think about

Fuck Hino and fuck Level-5.

1355193405.0,14n4pr,Gundam: The Origin - FAQ,Falldog,31,6,15,"**What is Gundam: The Origin?**

Origin is an award winning manga adapation of the series by Yoshikazu Yasuhiko. Widly popular among Japanese Gundam fans it remains fairly true to the original series but updates the suits

Bandai has announced that they'll be producing an animated adaptation of the series but haven't released any details. 

**What's the upcoming release from Vertical?**

Vertical's release of *Gundam: The Origin* is a limited hardcover release much like the Japanese hard cover collector's editions. Only a small amount of each volume will be printed and they will include extras like colour illustrations and translated essays and interviews. It's also worth noting that this is a brand new translation but I can't imagine much is different from when Viz made a run at releasing the whole series.

**How many are being made?**

That depends

**Will there be a digital edition??**

Vertical has commented on this several times and

**Is Vertical committed to releasing all of Origin?**

To quote Ed Chavez from Vertical

**Where can I pre-order?**

Personally I went through Amazon but check with your preferred reseller.

Char then ejected the cockpit

Even if we assume that Sazabi was indeed recovered by Neo Zeon, that only means he and Char are exactly the same on the genetic level.  If you go back and look at any scene in the Unicorn OVA's where Full Frontal takes his mask off, he has the scar that Char received during his sword fight with Amuro.  Scars are not embedded in your genetic code, and therefore would not be present on Char's clone.  The description on Gundam Wikia says that he possesses the ""residual thoughts of Char which were distorted in despair because humanity did not change after witnessing the miracle that occurred during 'Axis Shock.""  So, Unicorn Gundam takes place in UC 0096.  This is only three years after CCA.  The date for Char's death in CCA is listed as March 12th, 0093.  The date of his ""death"" combined with the next inconsistency is what made me consider all of this in the first place.  

So, the MSN-06S Sinanju Stein was stolen from Anaheim Eletronics by Neo-Zeon during a transfer from Granada to Von Braun. The Earth Federation forces composed of two Clop-class light cruisers that were sent to recover it were completely wiped out by the pilot of the Sinanju, Full Frontal, the man they call the Second Coming of Char Aznable, the Red Comet.""
Now, cloned Char, figured out how to implant memories contained in the psychoframe into Char's clone, discovered that Anaheim was transporting a suit based on the one custom made for Char, and then to top it all off, have the Char clone himself involved in stealing the suit.

It is highly unlikely that the technology to create a highly stable cyber-newtype clone existed at the point of CCA.  If we look at all the cyber-newtypes in the universal century, Puru Two and Marida Cruz.  Taking this further, the only characters to be both clones AND cyber newtypes (the Puru series) have been shown to be unstable.  Going through the entire Unicorn OVA series, Full Frontal never exhibits any of the traits seen in the cyber newtypes/cloned cyber newtypes.  

Let's take a look at Char's history for a second.  Char was born Casval Rem Deikun, then assumed the identity of Quattro Bajeena, then went back to being Char.  Throughout most of his life, he had to conceal his true identity.  As Char Aznable, he lied and wore a mask to prevent people from realizing he was really Casval Rem Deikun.  As Quattro Bajeena he wore sunglasses to hide his identity.  When he finally used his ""real"" identity of Char again it was at Dakar when he made his speech to the world.  Then, at the end of Zeta when he was assumed dead until you saw the empty Hyaku Shiki cockpit float by he waited until CCA to use his Char identity to ultimately force humanity's evolution.  However, his method of dropping Axis on the earth may have made him wanted as a war criminal.  Thus, it makes sense that he wouldn't want to necessarily be Char again.  IF Full Frontal is actually just Char and not just a clone of him

It is my belief that Full Frontal is actually Char Aznable.  He survived the conclusion of Char's Counterattack, he assumes the identity of Full Frontal.  In UC0096 his hair is incredibly long, as long as about three years worth of growth.  He forsakes the earthnoids, seeing them as undeserving of being saved after their stubborn refusal to change after the Axis Shock.  He steals the Sinanju Stein and impersonates himself to use Laplace's Box as a means to ensure the future for the spacenoids.  

I don't know how well fan theories are taken on this subreddit but my desire is to have a discussion and try to really figure out if Full Frontal is really Char or just his clone.  I believe that based on all the evidence,False,,t5_2sjr4,False,,,t3_1ay477

We need people to play Veterans of this war, or simply stare longingly off into the middle distance while a flag billows mournfully behind them What's that? No traditional acting instruction? Your acting even makes trolls embarrased to make fun of you? No problem.  

We need people with model kits and Suede jackets to tell us about the mobile suits and thier contributions during the war. And not just models, anything that looks like it may have come from the war. Spout facts and figures while trying desperatly to make it look interesting, just like a real historian!

What's that, people who can throw together a wirefram model of a colony and show it plunging to Earth, or showing how the machinery in mobile suit joints work, or even something as simple as the opening credits!

Hold on, organizers, artists, narrators, even Gundam lore consultants, all so that we can make this documentary and make it great! 

But most of all, people who want to make something cool for nerds to nitpick to pieces. 

Come on R/Gundam, something that will DOMinate, a Revil-ation, a product that will make jaws around the world colony-drop, (okay I'm done now) something that will make every Gundam fan around the world raise thier fists and cry ""SEIG ZEON!"" Who's with me!

Edit: I will serve as project coordinator and try to come up with some kind of script, any contribution, be it just your voice, or your relics or your time is incredibly valuable. I especially need people who know what kind of material and saftware we will need to compile all of this. The best thing we can do now, if we really care about this project, is to get as many people onboard as possible, tell your friends, bring them here and have them join us! Keep the enthusiasm up

Edit #2: Alright everybody, we are going to need to work together cooperatively over a long period of time. To be realistic, this project is a long term endeavor, it will take a lot of work, but this effort is supposed to bring together the best of all of our talent, all of our passion! Now, so that we can organize this more efficiently, of things we have and things we need. I also may set up a organization page outside of Reddit, I can't stress enough that this is not a weekend project

I hereby announce our end date, the UC 0079 project will be launched! (we still need a real name for this project!)

I was on another forum (uwants) and found an interesting thread about the direction newer Gundam series are heading.

**The point of topic is the newer Gundam series are heading towards the kiddy direction; as the original Gundam series (UC) is more about war, SEED, AGE, are more about heroism, which is more for kids.**

It seems like in Asia

Some people even go as far as saying: ‚ÄúSeed has been controversial for 10 years.  00 was the beginning of a downhill, and Bandai is slowly letting it wither.

Ultimately it boils down to Bandai is only going for the money at this point

**Personal opinion:**  I am a fan of the Seed series, after watching the UC I still don‚Äôt think Seed and 00 are that bad (Destiny is another story).  Age however, does strike me as immature, and the art style/mech design put me out of interest.

Mainstream Gundam animes consist of: Gundam Wing, and Gundam 00. The answer to my question above should be obvious, of course. Out of all the Mainstream Gundam Animes out there, the Cosmic Era is without a doubt the most Controversial Era in all of Gundam.

It's honestly something that has developed quite a negative reputation in the Gundam Community based on all the major problems it suffers from; one of these major problems being Gundam SEED Destiny in it's entirety. When I saw the 1st Gundam SEED, I did notice quite a lot of flaws with it that I wished were patched up. Granted, Gundam SEED HD Remastering IS an improvement, the problem is: it didn't fully solve the problem.

The Cosmic Era Timeline was meant to be a re-imagining of the Universal Century Timeline. In some ways, the Cosmic Era has become nothing but ""The Joke Timeline"" in the Gundam Community for haters, UC Fanboys, Wing Fanboys, etc... to pick on all the time.

Being someone who has been a fan of gundam for 16 years straight now

- Kira and Lacus being complete Mary-Sue Characters without question.

- Shinn Asuka being dropped as the main character in replace of Kira at the last minute in SEED Destiny

- Kira being always right and never wrong about everything he says and does.

- Kira inexplicably cheating death 3 times in a row with no explanation as to how he survived each time. 

- Mu La Flaga inexplicably surviving a Lohengrin to the face at the end of SEED when it clearly showed his shattered helmet floating through space. 

- The new cast in Gundam SEED Destiny  being overshadowed by the Old Cast because apparently the new cast wasn't as well recieved by the fans.
 
- The Constant use of Flashbacks and Re-Cap Episodes. 

- Gundam SEED having as much Recycled Stock Footage as Gundam Wing

- Massive unoriginality in the designs of Six Major Gundams in SEED Destiny

- Vaguely and/or Unexplained Technology all over the place.

- Athrun having the Same Exact Character Development Arc in SEED Destiny that he did in SEED.

- Kira having absolutely NO character development at all in Destiny.

- Pointless wasted characters such as Miguel Ayman and Heine Westenfluss.

- SEED Destiny's plot being in many ways just a mirror of Gundam SEED's plot all over agian.


This is all sounding like bad fanfiction. After enjoying Gundam SEED my first time around, I will say right now: I am a fan of what Gundam SEED currently is; except for Destiny. Gundam SEED right now, I still think is not TOO bad, and SEED Stargazer was actually Awesome! The only problem with it was that it was too short. I also found the SEED Astray mangas to be Very Enjoyable and with Much Better Story, and I do like how they at least **tried** to fix some of the plotholes in SEED. But unfortunately, they unintentionally made it worse by contradicting the events in the anime with the explanations they've provided for some of them.


My point here being: I know that Gundam SEED could have been **a lot** better than this. Mitsuo Fukuda; I understand he's a huge fan of Tomino, but rather a War of Different Ideologies.


I think after reading all that, and this time NOT done by Mitsuo Fukuda and his Wife. I believe that Gundam SEED can most definitely be fixed and it can really turn out to be a great re-imagining of the Universal Century Timeline if the proper time and effort was put into it.


I don't blame Gundam SEED Destiny for sucking. It wasn't it's fault. It was all due to Bad Directing and Behind-The-Scenes Politics (including Fukuda's Wife coming down with Brain Cancer during SEED Destiny's Development). Which further reinforces that SEED really needs a Reboot due to all the problems that happened during it's development. If SEED was able to get developed with an actual plan in mind

As many of you know I've been a big proponent of Vertical's release of [Gundam: The Origin](http://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/14n4pr/gundam_the_origin_faq/). While the first two volumes have been fantastic the blurbs on the back cover have given me a nice chuckle. Volume I's was ridiculously over dramatic while Volume II's run-on with *random emphasis* was just silly. 


Thus drives the premise of this contest. **The goal? Create an original blurb


While part of me thinks it would be great to see silly entries it would be fantastic if a well worded blurb could get consideration for print from Vertical. A bit of a pipe dream? Perhaps, something appropriate. Whatever you like because this contest is to be judged by your peers on r/Gundam! The most beloved entry will win a copy of **The Origin volume 3**! 


The rules are simple...

* Each blurb must be no more than 80 words in length
* Each user can enter up to three times
* Winner must be able to receive a shipment from Amazon US
* I may make up more rules between now and the start of the contest
* Well reasoned objections to the rules or means of contest will be considered
* Entries must be posted below by July 17th


To submit your entry...

* Simply add your comment below as a new comment to the story (in other words don't reply to someone elses comment or blurb with your own entry)


To vote on your favorites...

* Up-vote the blurbs you like!
* Votes will be hidden until the winner is announced
* Be sure to check back often for new entries

(I figured after watching Gundam Wing/FMA:B that it's big for the japanese to push the whole ""Anti-war"" talk to annoying levels, so I'm not really bothered by it) So my questions are...


Are there any other Gundam shows that are like Gundam Unicorn (Americanized kinda with no animation re-use)

And...

How many episodes are there going to be of Gundam Unicorn?

The reasons I dislike it are this:

 There are a lots of promising story threads that are never properly explored

A key issue I have here is that the Titans don't really have a plan. The original series could get away with a mostly reactive Zeon because it was clear the conflict was at a stalemate

Yes, and they're stuck in reactive survival mode from Jaburo onwards. This could be fine if we got a sense of the Titans progressively increasing their pressure (similar to how the White Base was growing more and more desperate in the first half of the original series), but that's clearly not what happened until the very end.

A similar issue was the Federation being such a non-entity ; you'd think it'd have a key political role

There really was a lot of potential for an interesting political conflict, such as having two separate arcs where Four dies at the end. This could maybe have worked if the narrative had spun this as a component of the Titans' plan, but like Rosamia's later arc it just looks like an unexpected side-effect of the Titans experimenting with augmented humans for the hell of it. Again, it comes back to the Titans not really having a plan besides ""doing random nasty stuff"". They have no wider strategy that I can discern, and the story suffers hugely from it.

This isn't the only big problem I have with Zeta ; there is something to be said about its unlikeable and unscruptable protagonists. Not only do I despise Camille, however repellent I found it. I don't think really I need to go into the sheer annoyance that is Katz. And I've never really liked Char in any of his incarnations (I found him to be a smug sociopathic jackass in MSG, An irresponsible coward in Zeta and a petty, hypocritical mass-murderer in CCA) Thank gods for Bright!

Then there are the Titans who are the most boring antagonists in a Gundam series ever. We are never giving any good argument from their side as to why their cause may be right beyond ""We're the Titans. Do what we say or we'll kill you."" Jamitov is barely in the series and has zero personality. Bask and Yazan are one-dimensional sadist bullies who are evil just for the sake of it. Scirocco just sits around in the background, where he pretty much disappears from the series only to pop up to kill Four and screw up at Dakar, vanish, pop again to kill Apolly then vanish again then die anti-climatically in the penultimate episode when he deserved to be the final boss for Kamille, not Scirocco who had zero history with him. Haman was indeed awesome but didn't have enough real screen-time as it was saved for ZZ.

And I don't even want to go into that whole ""Souls weighted down by gravity"" bullshit that Tomino thinks is deep philosophy and won't stop beating us over the head with.    

I know there's the mind set of ""It's dark

Something that I noticed when Bright was talking to Banagher is that Bright seems aware that gundams choose their pilots. And in the UC for the most part this seems true. 

Amuro, Kamillie, and Judau are all pilots of gundams that just happened to get into the cockpit by some crazy chain of events. A few of the other pilots were just test pilots that grew affinity for their suits.

Do you think it is possible that Zeon or the EFSF has any knowledge of this method of discovering pilots? It has never really been talked about but Bright seems to be Very knowledgeable of the minds of gundam pilots and he seems to understand this seemingly divine placement exists. Would it be possible that some hidden group of people are controlling the strings behind the pilots finding the gundams?

Flit disowning Asemu was interesting, also nice to add in the history of Vagan tech. Obright's moment was heartwarming to say the least, I genuinely feel bad for him. More evidence of competition in the Vagans, who gets to destroy the gundam. Probably one of the better cliffhanger episode endings of the entire series.

While the first two volumes have been fantastic the blurbs on the back cover have given me a nice chuckle. Volume I's was ridiculously over dramatic while Volume's II run-on with *random emphasis* was just silly. 


Thus drives the premise of this contest. The goal? Create a blurb

While part of me thinks it would be great to see silly entries it would be fantastic if a well worded blurb could get consideration for print from Vertical. 


A bit of a pipe dream? Perhaps... Yet I won't let a good suggestion go to waste! The most beloved entry will win a copy of **The Origin volume 3**! 


The rules are simple...

* Each blurb must be no more than 80 words in length
* Each user can enter up to three times
* Winner must be able to receive a shipment from Amazon US
* I may make up more rules between now and the start of the contest
* Well reasoned objections to the rules or means of contest will be considered


**Don't share your ideas or blurb just yet!** Start thinking about it


I do understand that people who post early will be more likely to accumulate more votes so that's why I'm making this announcement early. That way

My Thoughts  
First off, so heavy implication hes gonna get a new gundam, specially since AGE-3 is a wreck now. I'm liking the Bisidians because they are actually COMPETENT unlike the grunts of G1 and G2.  
Now, I liked the image of the caring father of Vagan. Project Eden kinda reminds me of the Destiny Plan of Seed Destiny (SORRY), in the way ur genetics determine your future. What it looks like at this point, Zeheart, as a very caring commander, is gonna defect from Vagan to stop Ezlecant. Zanald is sketchy, he seems really loyal to Ezlecant, so only time will tell with that one.  
As for Deen

1374563277.0,1ivdak,"A Theory on Scirocco's Newtype ""Powers""",Dracovitch,8,2,8,"Just a fair warning

So recently my fiancee and I have been rewatching Zeta Gundam

My fiancee pointed out that both Sarah and Reccoa were obviously being influenced by Scirocco, the wiki, fan sites, etc, and every single one comes up with the same thing. Scirocco is an evil genius who has the highest fucking charisma score in Gundam, and entices women to his side pretty friggin' easily. 

Now even I have a hard time believing he manages to enthrall so many with just charisma. We know that he made Kamille go insane at the end of the series

It makes sense really. With Kamille,"" what if instead it's just usually incredibly subtle? He uses his charisma and newtype powers to ""plant a seed"" in your mind that nudges your subconscious towards Scirocco and his goals. Perhaps this power entices women so easily because he can weave a little forced affection into the mix, making them think they're falling for him. 

So there's my crazy theory. Tear it apart.
