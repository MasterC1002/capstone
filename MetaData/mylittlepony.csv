###12/11/12 - Guide taken down

So! What has happened to the guide you may ask.

Well, and these are only links. Linking to copyrighted content is very much a legal gray area. There have been some court cases on the matter, ruling in both directions, and especially against when the violator is turning a large profit off of it. To reiterate, this guide has never had any financial gain associated with it whatsoever, offers for donations were always prompted to going into supporting the show by buying the episodes.

Hasbro as a toy company, and it's suspicious that it's taken down now.

**That's okay

&amp;nbsp;

Signing out for now

I'm not going to provide proof. I'm not going to fall to your level.**

**EDIT: Thank you for your kind words everyone. I just got back from work and decided to check this and it has over 200 comments. I'm at a loss for words. I might not be able to reply to all of them

Hello Reddit. I still haven't watched the Season 3 premier. A reason for this is because a friend of mine

Today

&gt;Dear Adrian
&gt;
&gt;First off I want to say that spending time with you has been a blast. Ever since you introduced me to MLP:FiM I was able to endure the long and boring nights in the hospital. Thank you for that. Every week I would be so excited when a new episode comes out that I could hardly fall asleep. It was also partly because you would come and see me. The doctors said it was bad for me
&gt;
&gt;When you first told me about it I was skeptical. I mean, but it seems like you really enjoyed it so I gave it a try. After the first few episodes I was hooked too. The smile you gave me when I admitted that I loved the show made me smile too. We both found solace from this show. Cancer for me and depression for you. I guess you could say we complete each other, like how two broken pieces can create a whole even if it is mismatched. I knew it wouldn't last long though. We were near the end of Season 2 and there were no more episodes left. I felt sad that it was over. Watching the show gave me an escape from reality and it was over. I wanted to tell you to come back the next day but I didn't, I didn't want to come off as someone selfish. But I didn't have to; you came back the next day too. You showed me Reddit's r/mylittlepony. I enjoyed their drawings and the community; you gave me back the magic. You even showed me FiMFiction for stories the fan wrote.
&gt;
&gt;You kept coming back again and again, the second time we watched it, I wasn't even watching. I just wanted to be near you, to see your face, to feel your warmth. Sometimes I would pretend to fall asleep so that you would put your arms around me. Or I would quietly sneak glances in the corner of my eye to memorize your face. And no matter what people say, you're beautiful. I never got the courage to tell you that, but you were braver than me. You would tell me things all the time. Things that made my day better.
&gt;
&gt;You would tell me that I looked beautiful even though I had tubes coming out of me. You would tell me I'm going to be fine even though we both know I won't. You would tell me that you were always going to be here for me even though that's impossible. You would tell me that my drawings and stories were good even though it couldn't compare to yours. You would tell me that Rarity is the best pony
&gt;
&gt;You would tell me all of these things
&gt;
&gt;I love you. I really, but I guess I didn't. I knew you didn't see me like that, but I could. And it didn't stop me from loving you. It might sound creepy but I learned a lot about you. I knew you had a rough childhood. I knew why you didn't have any friends. I knew that you hide behind your smile. I knew why you have that scar on your face. I knew all these things but I still love you.
&gt;
&gt;I'm going to miss our weekly discussion. I'm going to miss our small arguments on who's the best pony. I'm going to miss your drawings. I'm going to miss your stories. I'm going to miss you. I can't say it enough
&gt;
&gt;I wish that I wasn't sick. I wish that I could grow old. I wish that I could start a family. I wish that I could introduce my kids to the show. I wish that you could stay here by my side
&gt;
&gt;I know I promised to watch the Season 3 premier with you, you're talking to me.
&gt;
&gt;There are a lot of things I want to tell you but I won't have enough time. There is one though that you should know. I hope you beat your depression. I wonâ€™t be able to beat my cancer, and I can see that you truly enjoyed it. Use it to find a new meaning in life. Be a new person, go out, and make new friends that will understand you. You can do it. You were able to help me through a rough time and I can't repay you but just give you my words and I hope it's enough.
&gt;
&gt;Lastly I want to end this letter just like the letters the mane six write at the end of every episode. I guess you could say this is my last episode so it seems appropriate. So here's what I learned:
&gt;
&gt;That friendship truly is magic.
&gt;
&gt;Your best friend
&gt;
&gt;Lisa

She loved to browse r/mlp just as much as she loved watching the show. I want to say thank you for everything. From your drawings

I still can't watch S3 because it still hurts, thank you.

Story:  First appointment of the morning and I am assisting a pediatric dental resident.  The resident complains about the kid that we are about to see because last week the kid couldn't make it through the procedure.  The kid needs 2 baby teeth extracted because they are impeding the progress of her permanent teeth coming in.

The kid arrives and it is a little girl with a rainbow dash shirt on.  On the inside, is incredibly shy and doesn't want to get in the chair.  We manage to get her into the chair, but then she won't use laughing gas because she stand the smell.  The pediatric resident steps out of the room with her mom to have a talk about what to try next, leaving Emily and I alone.

As I am changing my gloves

Me: ""Well, will face her fears when it is really important.""  

Emily: ""I guess so..."" 

Me: ""Even Pinkie Pie says that we have to face our fears""

Emily: ""Well...""

Me: ""Emily


She tells me ok and then proceeds to hold my hand with a vice like grip.  She still refuses laughing gas, I couldn't believe the courage of this little kid.

We brohoof as she walks out and the pediatric resident can't believe that I got the kid to do the procedure.  When she asks me how I did it, and I chicken out and tell her that I watch it when I babysit my niece (I don't have a niece).  Doesn't matter though because she is really happy and tells the head of the clinic about it and I got some serious brownie points.  Basically MLP is awesome.

I told her that children's toys are not operated by their genitals and therefore EVERY toy is gender neutral. I then angrily ranted at her manager and another employee was kind enough to show me where the ponies were. Finally I was able to select 2 ponies for my son

Sure, and *refuse* to show people toys based on their own small-mindedness? (This was in Ann Arbor, Michigan, theoretically a liberal-minded city.)

When I made this post, what I've been trained to do for about 12 years, I was NOT expecting to be working in a warehouse, organizing uniforms, with no sunlight and no co-workers my age, and Dolores Umbridge as my boss. I came home after only two months, feeling like an absolute failure, at that point

And then I made my Rainbow Dash hoodie, compliments, and suggestions gave me the drive to get everything started up and running, and now I'm so busy making hoodies for all of my bronies, that I barely have time for anything else, but I'm soooooo happy!! I'm even doing a fashion show in the fall!

That was my first post on Reddit, and full of passion, which I love! 

All I can say is thank you. Thank you thank you thank you! Which doesn't even cut it! :D I love you guys

I know my little business could get shut down at any moment due to copyright

&amp;nbsp;  
  
[](/rrdsalute ""Bronies
  
Months ago, the moderators of TLA put forth a challenge to us, the pony fans. ""Our members are much more amazing than yours,"" they purported, ""and we want to prove it."" Of course, we here at /r/mylittlepony couldn't simply dismiss a challenge of this magnitude. Besides that, we know that *you*, are the most amazing bunch of people on reddit! As such
  
[](/louder ""Gotta show them our determination!"") Over the course of the next few weeks, weighted point total. The subreddit with the most points at the end of the competition will win! Win what, you might ask? [](/sp)   
  
[](/rdsitting ""That's an AWESOME prize!"") The winning subreddit will be awarded an amazing opportunity
&amp;nbsp;  

####Competition Details:  
&amp;nbsp;  

Though the entire competition will have several ways to participate, world-impacting problems. This part of the competition will last the longest, starting **right now** and lasting until **Sunday the 16th of September**.   
&amp;nbsp;    

**[UPDATE: Please read this FAQ! It answers some common questions about the contest!](http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/ywjf9/bvb_update_post_and_faq/)**  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
####How to participate:  
&amp;nbsp;    
    
Participating in this portion of the competition is simple! First, and you may choose any projects you want (working on *any* WCG project is okay, so long as you are working for the right team). Afterward, download the latest client software for your OS from [this page](http://boinc.berkeley.edu/download_all.php) (Choose the latest stable recommended release).    
  
If you wish to, and select [this checkbox](http://i.imgur.com/zt1lm.jpg). Note that while this will improve performance, it may also use additional power and generate additional heat.    
  
Once the Boinc Manager is installed, you need to tell the Boinc Manager that you wish to participate in the World Community Grid, so select ""Attach to a Project"" and then select ""World Community Grid"" from the provided list. So long as the Boinc Manager is now running, you are donating your computer power to the WCG project. Be sure to look at the preferences and settings to ensure that you aren't slowing down your computer during times when you wish to use it fully.   
&amp;nbsp;   
  
####Choosing a team:
&amp;nbsp;   
    
Next, so as to join the team wish to participate in. All hours of computation you produce will count toward this team's total in the competition, but only if you are a member of said team! Be sure that you've joined the team you wish to support! To join a team, visit the appropriate page linked below while logged in, and under the 'Team Control Panel' heading, click 'Join this Team'.  
   
**Benders** should join team **[reddit avatars](http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/team/viewTeamInfo.do?teamId=DDSTCB5H12)**  
**Bronies** should join team **[r/mylittlepony - Official MLP:FIM reddit community](http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/team/viewTeamInfo.do?teamId=JDSTCB5H12)**  
  
And that's it! Now so long as you keep the Boinc Manager running in the background
  
At the end of the competition, they will earn 34 points). reddit Gold and other goodies will be given out randomly to those that participate, even if you can only give one hour! We'll let you know more about those giveaways toward the end of the contest. The WCG portion of this competition will be the longest running section, and one that we hope everyone can and will participate it.  
&amp;nbsp;    
   
####Could you repeat that?    
&amp;nbsp;  
  
In brief
`1`. Make a new account on the **[WCG website](http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/reg/viewRegister.do)**. Choose projects
**EDIT**: To sign up and join a team simultaneously
`2`. **[Download](http://boinc.berkeley.edu/download_all.php)** and install the software. Make sure it's associated with the WCG.  
`3`. On the WCG website
`4`. Let the Boinc manager run
&amp;nbsp;    
  
####Final Notes:
&amp;nbsp;     
 
In the coming weeks, but until then, please sign up for the WCG and let's get this party started!

[](/twipride ""There's so much here to be proud of!"") It's hard to believe that over three weeks have passed since the start of our friendly contest with the subscribers of /r/TheLastAirbender. We've gone through three different competitions in that time, and dedication have been nothing short of overwhelmingly impressive! Between both subreddits, you've all accrued more than 147 *years* of donated CPU time for the World Community Grid, over *$33,000* in donations to the Without Borders programs, and generated tons of impressive and fun art! No matter who claims victory in the competition, the charities that benefit from these contributions are the real winners.   
  
[](/twibeam ""Thank you all so much!"") Before we move on to the final results, created art, or just lent your moral support to the rest of the team, *thank you all* for what you've done. It's nothing short of stunning what's happened here, and we're positively overjoyed to see how it all turned out. [](/sp)   
  

[](/twismile ""Time to get to the numbers!"") And so
####World Community Grid   
The [World Community Grid project](http://redd.it/ypcln) kicked off on August 23rd
  
Sometime soon we will be doing random drawings for those who participated
&amp;nbsp;  
  
At the end of the competition
  
*  The **Bronies** contributed a total of 124 years, 25 minutes, and 35 seconds, winning this portion of the contest to earn **45** points (Note that this time has been adjusted by three days to account for an accidental head start).  
  
*  The **Benders** contributed a total of 23 years, 45 miuntes, and 22 seconds, earning themselves **9** (18% of 45, rounded up) points.  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
This was a tremendous effort from all parties involved, don't let the close of the contest make you feel as if you should stop contributing! Our [WCG team](http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/team/viewTeamInfo.do?teamId=JDSTCB5H12) will be continuing to compute far into the future, and we now actively encourage everyone to spread the word and participate. Feel free to tell anyone and everyone you wish! Let's see if we can't keep the ball rolling.   
  
####Fundraiser

After an exciting [ten days of charitable donations](http://redd.it/zgere) the final results are in! The totals amounts collected by Crowdtilt are as follows:  
&amp;nbsp; 
  
*  The **Bronies** team donated a total of $25
  
*  The **Benders** team contributed a total of $8
&amp;nbsp;  
  
We are amazed at these numbers. You guys really pulled through here and did a fantastic job. The 'Without Borders' organizations will be grateful for this donation. Remember that the 'Without Borders' organizations work to better the people of the world
  
Please rest assured that prizes will be distributed very soon! We are still waiting for the final donation breakdowns in terms of contributors, and that they will be contacted via email. **Please be sure to monitor your CrowdTilt email address**. If a winner does not respond to our contact attempts within 24 hours, we will be forced to redraw a different name.  
  
####Art Contest  
  
There was a positively *huge* amount of phenomenal and wonderful artwork submitted for [this portion](http://redd.it/z3cct) of the contest. It was not only impressive
  
To see all of the entires
  
After much consideration
&amp;nbsp;  

*  The winner for the Bender team was [/u/PancakeBear](http://www.reddit.com/user/PancakeBear) for [Korra Snoo-sledding](http://i.imgur.com/b8zBp.png).   
  
*  The winner for the Brony team was [/u/Leiden](http://www.reddit.com/user/Leiden) for [Pinkie's New Friend](http://i.imgur.com/9T9Bn.png).  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
And the overall winner of the art contest

In the meantime, just look forward to it as a special treat somewhere on the horizon! You've all earned it, and we're proud of you beyond measure.     
  
Thank you to everyone and anyone who participated, and proud of the people you were competing against, as well.

Sheâ€™s an old teacher of mine that kept in touch over the years, but she insisted I go out and try to meet people instead of sitting at home reading.
 
She doesn't have a cell phone because she insists on communicating with nothing but handwritten mail. That seems kind of outdated
 
The police are a complete non-entity out in this backwater shit hole and Iâ€™m afraid of what will happen to her by the time the any real search gets underway. I need some serious advice because I think I know who did it.
 
There are some others I met who also think some messed up shit went down and we're about to go out looking for some answers.

Most people don't know it

**This warning would work best if repeated elsewhere. spread the news around if you can.**

[Reposting from EqD](http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/06/warning-tlc-my-crazy-obsession-seeks.html)

&gt;**""**I don't usually post things like this.  You are all free to enjoy pony however you wish

&gt;A show called My Crazy Obsession is sending a reporter around looking for someone with a huge pony collection.  They are visiting various forums/communities hoping to find the perfect target

&gt;&gt;*Hi Everybody!*

&gt;&gt;*I am casting a show for TLC about people with unique collections or obsessions. I found this forum and wanted to get in touch with anybody who has the most amazing My Little Pony collection to see if they'd be interested in sharing their story on our show. Please shoot me an email if this sounds like something you'd like to be a part of. Hope to hear from some of you!*  


&gt;My Crazy Obsession has never been about showing people in a positive light. The crazier the better. It makes good TV

&gt;Again

There is nobody normal enough to not be made out to look like a freak by these people. These shows bank off people who think they can ""give other like them a good name""

if you're thinking of taking them up on this offer for the sake of making the fans look good

**edit:** If you aren't from around the states

&gt;This warning is more serious than it sounds, the wonders of editing can make even the best of people look like a freakshow. 

For an example of one of the more mild examples from this show

This is a MILD example of what this show can do. some will throw in elements like music to make the person seem even more deviant.",self,t5_2s8bl,1340343813.0,,snails,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/vewol/warning_tlc_my_crazy_obsession_seeks_pony/
